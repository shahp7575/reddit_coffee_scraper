What I realised in my case that me being constipated definitely a cortisol raiser for me & being constipated for 3-4 weeks was not fun at all. Now my main concern is to make sure I dont feel constipated. Is adding fat necessary or just consume more ground beef?

The issue is the drink itself. I love the practicality of the machine and even more so the smell of the 8 different types of coffee I bought along with the machine, but one thing worries me:

I love coffee, but I like it sweet, nothing exaggerated, but I'm not a fan of the bitterness that many people talk about, so I prefer a simpler roast with a lighter flavor. I'm also a big fan of cappuccino, but I noticed that Nespresso doesn't produce drinks other than coffee; there are no cappuccino capsules or other drinks of that type, which isn't the end of the world, but the problem is trying to make those drinks on my own.

Looking at the website when I went to buy the machine, I noticed several points that mentioned recipes using coffee, even the recommendation for the Aeroccino, which I bought along with the machine. However, in these two weeks, all my attempts to make a lighter drink were a failure because either I had to add excessive amounts of sugar to reduce the intensity (which I can't do due to health issues) or the coffee was still too strong, even following recipes like Sweet Vanilla with condensed milk and milk made in the Aeroccino.

So I'd like some help and tips on how I can make lighter drinks in a practical way?",2,1767488814.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

I have been contemplating purchasing one of this as opposed to something like a Nintendo switch for my 6 year old daughter. She’s very active and would enjoy something like this. Before I fork out over $300 for the console and play pass I just had a few questions. 

How much living room space do you need ie distance from the box itself? Wondering if I’d need to move my coffee table or rearrange my living room to accommodate more space. 

Is the $89 a year play pass the only option for games aside from the 5 free in the starter pack and is it worth the subscription? 

Lastly, any input from others with children in the same age demographic would be greatly appreciated. How do they like it? Is it something that gets used a lot? Are there things that work well for both parents and kids?

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

I just don’t really have anyone I can talk to about this irl and thought you guys might find it hopeful/useful.

I was bulimic from the age of 16-24 and gave myself permanent lifelong stomach damage because of it. More specifically: almost daily inflammation, had to remove my gallbladder, and food basically digests more slowly through me. I probably have the digestion of a senior citizen and I’m only 32.

Up until I went on meds for ADHD, I tried probably hundreds of diets, my weight fluctuated massively throughout the years, and nothing ever stuck. I had a legitimate compulsion whenever I was upset or needed comfort to just grab something to eat or drink even if I wasn’t hungry.

Fast forward to three weeks ago: I started on meds intended for people with addictions (like smoking) that also helps people with depression and ADHD. This was mainly to treat other issues in my life but as a “btw”, my doctor told me the benefits are that people tend to lose weight on these meds.

Didn’t really think too much of it because like I said, nothing has ever worked for me. I always inevitably go back to overeating.

Within days of starting these meds, that part of my brain has completely switched off. I’ve tested it numerous times by thinking of yummy food, or when I’m feeling even slightly upset, thinking of making my favorite coffee drink, but nothing seems appetizing or appealing to me anymore.

The meds I’m on are meant to help treat people with dopamine deficiencies. I feel happier, I wake up with energy, my mind is more clear than it’s ever been, and best of all I don’t have a toxic relationship with food. If I’m hungry, I eat, but I almost never finish my plate anymore and I NEVER snack. 

That was completely unheard of for me before. I was a huge snacker and had to have certain snacks at certain times (maybe a bit OCD-like), but now I never buy snacks anymore. I just don’t crave it.

For alcohol too: I never drink, but when I do, I tend to keep drinking/overdo it. The last time I drank which was about a week ago, I only drank half of a beer and was done. It was crazy lol.

Hopefully this helps someone feeling trapped like I did. It’s very possible you have a deficiency in your brain like I did that compels you to use food as comfort. I would bring it up to your doctor!

And for anyone curious: the meds I’m on are Bupropion XL. You don’t need ADHD to get prescribed them, just anxiety and depression.

1q3bqt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WebNovels/comments/1q3bqt4/ipclass_f_chapter_1/,[IP]Class F - Chapter 1,"# Chapter 1: Class F

# The Teacher

You ever look at a room full of kids and wonder if the universe is playing a long, elaborate joke on you? That’s me, every Monday through Friday at 07:45 hours. They call it “Class F.” F for Foundation, officially, but unofficially? F for Failure. These were the washouts, the defects, the students no one else wanted to deal with because their powers were too weak, too weird, or simply too useless to monetize. My job isn’t to turn them into heroes; it’s to teach them how to survive long enough to not explode or electrocute a neighbor. Or themselves.

I sipped my coffee black, and bitter enough to strip paint, before turning to face the classroom.

“Alright, let’s do this again. Introductions. Your name, and what you think your power is. Please try not to undersell yourselves this time.”

First up was Daniel. He was slouched so low in his chair he looked ready to melt into the linoleum, hoodie pulled up to hide his eyes and one earbud dangling against his neck.

“My name’s Daniel,” he muttered.

I waited, letting the silence stretch thin and uncomfortable until he sighed a deep, theatrical exhale that rattled his chest. “I can, like, give myself a nosebleed.”

A few kids snorted, and someone in the back whispered legendary, but I didn’t laugh. I didn’t even blink. I leaned forward against my desk. “On command?”

Daniel looked up, blinking sluggishly. “Yeah. Pretty much.”

When I asked him how, he just shrugged, shifting in his seat. “I just kinda think about it real hard. Then boom. Blood.”

My brain clicked, the gears of my old life grinding off the rust. Wait.

“Have you tried doing anything with the blood once it’s out?”

When he admitted he just cleaned it up before his mom saw, I stared at him not in judgment, but in absolute, terrifying awe. “Jesus, kid. You’re not a bleeder. You’re a blood manipulator. You’re sitting on a literal war crime of potential.”

Daniel just blinked again, mouth slightly open.

Next was a girl with bright green braids and a denim jacket armoured in band pins who had kicked her boots up onto the desk leg. “Tasha,” she said, popping her gum. “I can charge my phone with my hand.”

Another snicker rippled through the room, but I stayed stone-faced. I asked if she had ever held a car battery. She looked alarmed, the gum freezing mid-chew.

“Good instinct,” I said. “But next time, we’re getting you insulated gloves. You’re not a walking charger, Tasha. You’re a generator. You might be able to fry drones out of the sky if we train you right.”

Her eyes widened, just a fraction.

Row by row, the pattern revealed itself. The kid who thought he was trash because he could make his skin slightly rubbery was actually capable of shock absorption; with the right focus, kinetic redirection. The girl who could only talk to spiders possessed surveillance capabilities that Homeland would kill for.

They thought they were broken, but they weren’t. They were just ignored, thrown into the junk drawer of the academy system because they didn’t fit the mold. The room itself was a testament to our standing. The plaster was peeling in scabs like a bad sunburn, revealing the grey concrete bones of the building underneath. It smelled of i wool and years of accumulated disappointment, a sharp contrast to the lavender-scented air conditioning of the upper levels.

And now, they were mine.

“Alright.” I started pacing the front of the room, coffee in one hand, the other gesturing like a conductor leading an orchestra off a cliff. “Here’s the deal. You are not weak. You are not jokes. You are underdeveloped ammunition. You’re rusty knives, unsharpened arrows, loaded slingshots in a world of laser cannons. But let me be clear.”

I stopped, looking every single one of them in the eye. “You can kill a god with a slingshot if you aim it right.”

They stared back, the atmosphere in the room shifting, becoming heavy and charged. A single drop of crimson leaked from Daniel’s nostril, and he didn’t even look fazed. I smiled a shark’s smile, devoid of warmth.

“Class F. Let’s see how far we can take this.”

\-----

Getting them to the gym required running the gauntlet. We stepped out into the main corridor just as the bell for second period chimed, flooding the halls with the pristine, polished future of the Academy. Class A. The Golden Children.

The air changed instantly. It stopped smelling of floor wax and started smelling of ozone and expensive cologne, sandalwood and superiority. The lighting panels here were calibrated to a soft, golden daylight spectrum that made everyone look like they had just walked out of a skin-care commercial. They moved in a sea of tailored navy blazers and perfect posture, projecting an aura of effortless power.

The reaction from my students was immediate and painful to watch. Daniel pulled his hood lower. Tasha stopped chewing her gum, her defiance shrinking into a scowl. They hugged the lockers, making themselves small, instinctively stepping out of the path of the “real” heroes.

A group of Class A students stopped near the water fountain. One of them, a tall boy with sunlight bending unnaturally around his fingers, glanced at my group. He didn’t sneer; he didn’t have to. He just looked through them, as if they were a smudge on a window, before turning back to his friends with a laugh that sounded like expensive crystal breaking.

I stopped walking. I didn’t say a word. I just stood in the center of the hall, letting the flow of elite students break around me like water around a rock. I caught the tall boy’s eye and held it. I didn’t use a power. I didn’t need to. I gave him the look that comes from seeing things that would turn his golden sunlight gray.

His smile faltered. He looked away first.

“Eyes front,” I commanded, my voice cutting through the noise. “Walk like you own the concrete, not like you’re afraid of it. Move.”

We turned the corner and descended the stairs, leaving the sunlight and the polish behind. Down to the sublevels. The air got cooler here, smelling of stale recirculated oxygen and old grease. The lighting flickered, buzzing with a headache-inducing hum.

This was our kingdom. The guts of the building.

\-----

The thing about kids with unstable powers is that they don’t need encouragement; they need a controlled environment, padded walls, and a team of trauma therapists on standby. What they got instead was me.

By 08:27, I had marched the collective dysfunction into the lower gymnasium. Most of them assumed we were going on a tour, or maybe a fire drill, clutching breakfast bars or, in Livia’s case, a sketchbook held like a shield. I locked the heavy blast doors behind us, the thud echoing in the cavernous space, and walked to the control console to prime the simulation field.

“Alright,” I said, my voice amplifying over the room’s speakers. “Welcome to your first practical session. The goal today is simple: stay alive for five minutes while I try to kill you.”

Tasha dropped her granola bar. It hit the floor with a pathetic pat. “I’m sorry, what?”

I leaned into the mic. “It’s non-lethal. Mostly. Pressure pads, low-voltage shocks, maybe a minor gas leak to test lung capacity. If you pass out, that’s a fail. If you scream, I’ll make fun of you. If you survive, I might consider not reporting you to the Board as waste management.”

Daniel raised a hand, but I ignored it and punched the timer. The field activated with a seismic hum. Turrets rose from the floor plates with whining servos, walls shimmered as active light grids snapped online, and a mechanical arm in the far corner unfolded with distinct, malicious enthusiasm.

The first thing Daniel did was bleed. Not voluntarily. He scrambled back, tripped over his own shoelace, and face-planted into the mat, coming up with a gushing nose. But then, physics took a holiday. The blood didn’t drip; it hovered, trembling in the air like red mercury. The atmosphere around him distorted, rejecting gravity, and the blood curved midair, thinning, sharpening, aligning like iron filings to a magnet. Targeting.

I made a note on the glass of the observation deck.

Tasha, meanwhile, had backed herself into a corner, holding her phone out like a holy talisman against a vampire. A small drone buzzed her on a standard intimidation pass, barely moving at speed, but when it sparked, so did she. The air around her cracked with the smell of ozone and her phone screen flared white-hot. Her braids lifted an inch off her shoulders as static tension spiked, and the drone fried mid-air, dropping like a stone.

She dropped the phone, shaking her hand. “Oops.”

I made another note, underlining it twice.

Row by row, chaos unfolded. They stumbled, adapted, and reacted. Some screamed, some froze solid, and one kid tried to play dead until the floor shocks corrected that strategy. Another tried to punch a turret and immediately nursed a bruised hand. Yet none of them quit. Not even when the gas vents hissed green fog or the shock tiles flared red under their feet. Livia used her charcoal sketches to predict turret timing, turning the session into a desperate dance of rhythm and dodge.

They weren’t ready, not even close, but they were trying. In a slaughterhouse like this world, trying was the only currency that mattered.

At the four-minute mark, the new kid Gabe lost the handle. His ability was kinetic recoil, which sounds cool on paper until you realize it turns your instinctive flinch into a concussive explosion. A turret swung his way and he panicked, throwing his hands out.

Boom.

The sound wasn’t just a bang; it was the wet thud of air leaving a body violently. The shockwave hit Daniel square in the ribs, sending him into the wall with a sickening crack. He slid down the metal plating, gasping for air that wouldn’t come, his shirt staining red from the internal impact.

Gabe didn’t just look scared; he looked like he was watching a car crash he was driving. His hands hovered, shaking, fingers curled like claws. Then came the reaction. Blood floated again from Daniel’s nose, not droplets this time, but a ribbon. Sharper. Angry. It coiled like a snake ready to strike back at Gabe.

I slammed the kill switch and the simulation died instantly, leaving a silence that hummed in the bones.

Gabe backed away, trembling, horrified. “I didn’t mean, I wasn’t—”

“Stop.”

My voice came out too loud, too cold, cutting through the gym like a blade. I walked to the center of the mats where everyone was watching me now. No jokes, no snorts, no snickering. The fear was real, and it smelled like sweat and burnt circuits.

My own pulse hammered against my ribs, a traitorous drumbeat. I’d pushed too hard. Too fast. I was treating them like soldiers, and they were barely teenagers. One inch to the left, and Daniel wouldn’t be bruising; he’d be bleeding out.

“You don’t get to hurt each other,” I said, scanning their faces. “Out there, the world is cruel enough. In here, I’m crueler. But I will not let you turn on your own.”

Gabe nodded, eyes wide and wet, while Daniel coughed and winced as Tasha helped him to his feet. I took a breath, forcing my heartbeat to slow.

“You did better than I expected.” I looked at the blood drying on the floor. “Class F. First blood drawn. Not bad.”

\-----

# Daniel

The locker room was quiet, except for the high-pitched whine of the ventilation system and the sound of running water.

I gripped the sides of the porcelain sink, my knuckles turning white. My ribs throbbed in a steady, dull rhythm, a reminder of the wall I’d just become intimate with. But that wasn’t what made my hands shake.

I looked into the mirror. My face was pale, ghost-like under the flickering fluorescent strip. A smear of dried red ran from my nose to my chin.

I splashed cold water on my face, scrubbing hard, trying to wash away the feeling of the gym. The fear. The sudden, terrifying clarity of it.

I watched the water swirl down the drain, pink and frothy. And then, it stopped.

Just for a second. A heartbeat. The pink water at the bottom of the sink didn’t drain. It hesitated. It rippled against the flow of gravity, pulling upward, reaching for me like it knew me.

I blinked, and the moment broke. The water gurgled away, leaving just the empty white porcelain.

I turned off the tap, staring at my own hands. The Teacher said I was a weapon. For the first time in my life, I was terrified he might be right.

When I first started I was obsessed. I read everything I could, watched YouTube tutorials, took notes, couldn’t wait until I had enough time to try another batch to see if I could get it right. I’ve gotten a lot better over time, to the point that I can say that I reliably roast good coffee. I’ve got a reliable recipe/profile for the Behmor. Deviating from it doesn’t improve the result.

I’ve been saving up to upgrade at some point (got about $1k set aside), but I’m starting to reconsider. I have three kids, a spouse who also works full time and other hobbies. It’s been hard to make time to roast. While I like exploring new coffees, I’ve lately found myself looking for roasted coffee instead of green. I like that I can make good coffee for less, but I’m not excited by it. Maybe that’s due to how little variety/challenge has come with roasting, or maybe this hobby has run its course.

**Since SF Investigates shared with us the January 2nd, 2025 photo, aka, the last known photo we have of her, I immediately dropped what I was doing to do this and find the exact location.**



**The Last Known Photo Location is:** 6231 Hetzler Rd, Culver City, CA 90232



**EXPLAINING WHY ITS CULVER CITY, NOT BALDWIN HILLS:** 

Just in case anyone is confused: While I know SF Investigates said Baldwin Hills, it *technically* is Culver City, but as you can see on the map, it is literally on the cusp so both area really correct.



**SURRONDING PARKS:**

The location is in the area of two parks: Culver City Park & Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook.



**RENTAL HOME DRIVE APPROX TIME:**

It seems the park is around a 20 minute drive from their approximate rental home.



**PHOTO EDITING:**

I edited the colors to my best ability to get a better scope of the original color scheme without any filters. So, because it was color edited by me, flaws can occur.



**OPINION**:

This isn’t an opinion post, so I don’t have much to say other than they were visiting multiple parks in the last known photo of her. Maybe just something to pin for the future.

  
Maybe he was trying to find the right moment to end her life *(\*If he was the one who did it, its all alleged and unproven as of now\*)* Maybe they just like to walk around parks and talk, maybe both. No clue.

Not really looking for a massive group or endless small talk. Just one or two people who actually reply and want to build a real friendship over time — messages, voice notes, maybe calls eventually.

1q3bfc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1q3bfc8/sf_earth_the_show/,"[SF] Earth, The Show","	Dr. Folshi had earned his Distinguished Chair as he’d earned his doctorate: the physics of optics. Like man men, Dr. Folshi has a deep desire to be someone, which his work and life have never delivered. He’s always felt there’s something more, some membrane that he could break through with sheer thought, and on the other side would be some new development in human thinking. Of all the people on Earth, Dr. Folshi had been selected as the very best target for Zal’s plan.

	The first step was to lure him to a nearby coffee shop, with the promise of discussing a potential grant from the McRae Foundation, which supposedly exists to give away money to physics professors in need. Grants are catnip to professors. Zal’s human infiltrator suit let him blend in seamlessly with the affluent coffee sippers, mimicking the movements, look, and voice of a 40 something year-old Ivy-educated grant manager. They’d agreed to meet at Looney’s.

	“It’s a pleasure to meet you in person Matt.”

	“Thank you for making the time Dr. Folshi.”

	“The pleasure’s all mine. This is perfect timing really, because I have just been finishing up a new program of study, into a fascinating branch of optics that I think may really make some progress here on Hartford’s intractability problem.”

	Between the burr of the grinders, early 2000s generic light rock on the speakers, and the chatter of customers, it was a private conversation between the man and the near-man. 

	“I know what you did yesterday. I know what shirt you almost put on this morning, and I know everything about you Dr. Forshi.”

	“Hah, ya, it sometimes feels like that these days with Facebook and Instagram.”

	“An orange shirt. You nearly made that fashion blunder this morning.”

	“Wait. How do you…”

	“Yesterday you bought two egg McMuffins at the drivethrough.”

	“You got PIs to follow me? Look, if this is some sort of prank.”

	“This is the most serious conversation you’ve ever had. Listen to me carefully. I don’t have much time. I’m a director, of a TV show, which is your planet. We have cameras everywhere and film interesting people, and places, and turn it into a narrative series that’s famous galaxy-wide. Earth, the show. It’s an institution. And it’s one that’s coming to an end.”

	“I don’t…”

	“Due to your work.”

	“My work? Are you Matt? Who are you?”

	“I’m Zal. And never mind who I am. I want to make you an offer, that’s to everyone’s advantage. Because one day, years from now, your work will enable discovery of our cameras.”

	“Please, I think I need to go.”

	Zal grabbed his hand as he began to get up. 

	“Let go of me!”

	“Please, professor, keep your voice down.”

	Dr. Folshi sat back down.

	“Listen to the offer. Then you can go back to your class, or flirting with that grad student who’s never going to go out on a date with you.”

	He stared intently at Zal, who continued, “Decades from now, your work leads to other work, that eventually enables humans to detect the show. And when that happens, the show ends. Because it’s the authenticity of Earth that matters to our audience, which numbers in the trillions across countless species and civilizations.”

	Dr. Folshi was reeling at this strange man’s story of a galactic TV show. He was obviously mentally ill, but also knew too much. Some sort of stalker. Or maybe a YouTuber with some new crazy prank like that guy who interrupted his lecture last year and yelled “BOOOO!”.

	“When the show ends, my job ends. And thousands of others too.”

	“So you want me to, what?”

	“Abandon your work on optical sensors. Change fields. We’ll pay you.”

	Dr. Folshi was speechless. Zal described how they’d pay him in “Large Favours” that would be prudently invested, and when, one day, Earth joins the galactic community and the show ends, his “brood descendants” would be generationally wealthy in a universe of wonders. 

	“These are standardized intergalactically, according to the exchange rate with local Large Favours. Like, how much you’d owe a podmate for moving them to a new shelldome. That has a value in currency of course, which is hiring movers to do it. But the value is much higher than the currency units because it’s painful to move someone. I know two best podmates who nearly stunned each other over a move!”

	“I don’t care what they are. You’re saying you’re going to pay me hundreds of these ‘Large Favours’, and then decades from now, I’ll get the money? Or my grandkids?”

	“Your brood descendants will never have to lift a tentacle, or appendage.”

	Dr. Folshi supplied the missing word: “Arms.”

	“They’ll never lift their arms. Unless they want to.”

	“You’re saying you’ll pay me in Monopoly money that I can’t see, and that you say I can’t have.”

	“Correct Dr. Forshi. Because Earth, The Show, is going on right now, and the show must go on.”

	“That you say is a galaxy-wide hit. And it’s filmed with tiny cameras that people can’t detect, but that in 20 or 30 years… I’ll be involved in that? Then your show isn’t real life?”

	“Correct. And I’m not going to negotiate the payment. It’s 500 Large Favours for moving on. Look elsewhere. Physics is a big place. It doesn’t matter whether you get the Large Favours this orbit, or your brood will later - tither way, your ‘patrimony is getting paid’, to use your expression.”

	Greed got the better of Dr. Folshi, as it did the other hundreds of physicists Zal and his team approached over the following weeks. 

	“If you’re some sort of alien producer who’s rich then you can figure out how to get me some real money on Earth.”

	“The viewers would scream bloody murder. There’s thousands of directors scouring the Earth for shots at all times. Someone would find out. And if not with you, then with the others who I’ll be offering the same deal to. Hundreds of profs can’t all get rich at once out of thin air.”

	“I’m not saying I would but if someone were to report this…”

	“That person would be missing out on a great offer. One that I’m prepared to double if you just say yes to this and let me move on. Threats do not become you Dr. Folshi.”

\`	“5000.”

	“No.”

	“Why not?”

	“I said 1000. Invested. It’ll earn 10% a year, or more. You can do the math doctor.”

	“For all I know I’m negotiating with ESPN here for basically some sort of important extension of broadcast rights. You’re saying we’re going to undermine the whole show once people find out there’s aliens recording everything with secret cameras?”

	Fish on the hook: Dr. Folshi’s “leverage”. It was an easy matter of concluding the negotiations. 

	Zal’s eyestalk was twitching as he turned off the infiltrator suit back at their outpost. It was even more exhilarating than he’d imagined. And he’d navigated the bargaining perfectly. Zal’s first instinct in any situation was to get out of paying, but this was just farcical. “Large Favours?” That’s some kind of money? And different civilizations get along?

	Zal dipped his eyestalks in mock flourish to his pod mates: “We’re now 'Earth, the show’. Producers, not colonists. All will report the aliens great concern about detecting cameras.”

	When the first colony ships landed, they were greeted with smiles and cheers. Earth was finally joining the peaceful, pan-galactic universe! ",1,1767487412.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1q3bf6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1q3bf6w/im_25_and_heres_how_i_reset_my_life_in_just_2/,I’m 25 and here’s how I reset my life in just 2 months,"
I’m 25 years old and two months ago I was living the most mediocre, directionless existence imaginable.

I was working a remote data entry job making $18 an hour. It was mind numbing work that I could barely focus on. I’d log in at 9am, spend half the day distracted by YouTube and Reddit, take twice as long as I should on every task, and log off at 5pm having accomplished basically nothing.

I was living alone in a one bedroom apartment that looked like a disaster zone. Dishes piled up for weeks, trash overflowing, laundry covering the floor, my bed unmade for months. I’d walk in after work and feel depressed just looking at the state of my living space but I never had the energy to clean it.

My routine was completely fucked. Wake up at 8:50am, roll out of bed, log into work in my pajamas, sit at my computer all day switching between work and distractions, log off, immediately start gaming or scrolling until 2 or 3am, pass out, repeat. Every single day the same.

I had no friends. Not exaggerating, I genuinely had zero real friends. Everyone from college had moved on with their lives and I’d just let all those friendships die. My only social interaction was occasional texts with my parents and the chat in whatever game I was playing.

I wasn’t dating anyone. Hadn’t been on a date in over a year. I’d think about trying dating apps but then I’d look at my life and realize I had nothing interesting to offer anyone. No hobbies, no stories, no social life, just work and gaming and scrolling. Who would want to date that?

I had no savings despite making decent money for someone living alone. Every month I’d spend everything I made on rent, food delivery, impulse purchases on Amazon, game subscriptions, random shit I didn’t need. Never put away a single dollar for emergencies or the future.

I was completely out of shape. Hadn’t exercised since high school. Eating garbage constantly, gaining weight, feeling tired all the time, just physically deteriorating while sitting at my desk 16 hours a day.

The worst part was knowing how much potential I was wasting. I’d graduated college with a decent GPA, had skills I could develop, opportunities I could pursue. But I was choosing to do none of that. Just coasting through life doing the bare minimum and filling the rest of my time with empty distractions.

I’d have these moments of clarity every few weeks where I’d realize how much I was fucking up my twenties. I’d tell myself tomorrow I’ll start changing things. Tomorrow I’ll wake up early, work out, be productive, stop wasting time. Tomorrow never came.

That was 60 days ago.

Now everything is different:

I’m working as a junior analyst at a logistics company making $54k a year.

I wake up at 6:30am every day and actually feel good about it.

I work out 6 days a week and I’ve lost 23 pounds.

My apartment is clean and stays clean.

I’m learning SQL and Python and actually retaining it.

I have $3,200 in savings for the first time in my life.

I reconnected with two old friends and we hang out regularly now.

I’m on my second date with someone I actually like this weekend.

I don’t feel like I’m wasting my life anymore.

How did I completely reset my life in 60 days? I stopped relying on motivation and built a system that forced me to change.

## Step 1: I admitted my life was going nowhere

The first thing I had to accept was that my life was objectively going nowhere. I was 25 years old with no career trajectory, no relationships, no savings, no health, no direction. Just existing day to day in this comfortable numbness.

I could keep pretending I was just taking my time or figuring things out, but the reality was I was wasting my potential and my twenties on nothing. Once I accepted that, it became clear that anything would be better than continuing the same path.

That honesty with myself was the foundation. I stopped making excuses and just admitted yeah this is fucked and needs to change immediately.

## Step 2: I found a complete structured plan

I knew I couldn’t rely on willpower or motivation because those had failed me dozens of times. I’d get motivated for two days, try to change everything at once, burn out, and go back to my old routine.

I needed external structure that would force me to change even when I didn’t feel like it. Something that would tell me exactly what to do every day so I wasn’t making constant decisions based on how I felt in the moment.

I was on Reddit late one night, again, and saw someone mention this app called Reload in a comment. They said it builds 60 day reset plans that start from your actual current situation and progressively increase week by week.

I downloaded it expecting another generic productivity app that wouldn’t work. But this was different because it asked real questions about where I actually was. What time do you wake up now? 8:50am. How often do you work out? Never. What’s your routine? Work from home distracted all day, game until 3am. What do you want to change? Everything.

It built a complete 60 day plan starting from my pathetic baseline, not some fantasy version of myself. Week one wasn’t wake up at 5am and transform overnight. It was wake up at 8am instead of 8:50am, do 20 minute workouts 3 times, apply to 5 jobs, clean apartment once. Small enough that I couldn’t fail.

But the plan covered literally everything. Sleep schedule, workout routine, job applications, skill development, meal prep, cleaning schedule, reading time, financial planning, all structured day by day with gradual increases each week.

## Step 3: I let the system block my distractions

The app had a blocking feature that completely prevented access to time wasting sites and apps during scheduled work hours. Not gentle reminders I could ignore, actual hard blocks I couldn’t bypass without factory resetting my devices.

From 9am to 6pm every day, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, gaming, everything was blocked. When I tried to open them they just wouldn’t load. That external enforcement removed the constant temptation and decision fatigue of resisting distractions.

When you literally can’t access the things that waste your time, you have to do something productive instead. That forced discipline carried me through the first few weeks when my willpower would have absolutely failed.

## Step 4: I followed the plan exactly without modifications

Week one I woke at 8am, did three 20 minute workouts, applied to 5 jobs, cleaned my apartment once, read for 15 minutes twice. That’s it. The goals were small but I hit all of them.

Week two increased slightly. Wake at 7:45am, four 25 minute workouts, apply to 7 jobs, meal prep on Sunday, read 20 minutes daily. Still manageable.

Week three I got my first interview. Didn’t get the job but it proved I wasn’t unemployable. Kept applying while following the plan.

By week four I was waking at 7:30am, doing 40 minute workouts 5 times per week, applying to 10 jobs weekly, cooking most of my meals, keeping my apartment clean consistently. The routine was becoming automatic.

Week five the plan increased to waking at 7am, hour long workouts, 15 job applications per week, learning SQL 30 minutes daily. I was building real skills now instead of just consuming content.

Week six I got three interviews in one week. One turned into an offer. Junior analyst at a logistics company, $54k salary, benefits, actual career growth potential. I accepted immediately and started the following Monday.

By week eight I was waking at 6:30am naturally, working out 6 days a week for 60-75 minutes, excelling at my new job, learning SQL and Python every evening, reading 45 minutes before bed. My entire life had restructured around productivity and growth.

## Step 5: I used the extra income to build savings

Going from $18 an hour to $54k salary was a massive jump. Suddenly I was making three times as much money. The plan included financial structure so I didn’t just waste the extra income.

I set up automatic transfers to move $600 into savings the day I got paid, before I could spend it on anything else. First month $600. Second month another $600. Third month I had over $2,000 saved, more than I’d ever had in my life.

Having that financial buffer completely reduced my stress around money. I wasn’t living paycheck to paycheck anymore. I could handle unexpected expenses. I was building actual financial security for the first time.

## Step 6: I rebuilt my social life from nothing

One part of the plan was dedicated social time each week. Reach out to one person, make plans to hang out, actually follow through. This was uncomfortable because I’d been isolated for so long.

I texted two friends from college I’d ghosted and apologized for disappearing. Both responded positively and we made plans to meet up. First time hanging out with friends in person in over a year.

We got dinner and it was awkward at first but then we fell back into our old dynamic. They noticed I seemed different, more energetic and focused. I told them about the changes I’d made and they were genuinely happy for me.

Now we hang out regularly, every couple weeks. Having real friendship again instead of just online interactions made me realize how isolated I’d been.

I also started going to a climbing gym that was part of my workout routine. Started talking to regulars there, made some casual gym friends. My social circle went from zero to actually having people I see and talk to regularly.

## Step 7: I started dating again

Six weeks into my transformation I felt confident enough to try dating apps again. This time I actually had things to talk about. My new job, working out regularly, learning new skills, having hobbies beyond gaming.

Matched with someone, we texted for a few days, met for coffee. First date went well, we made plans for a second date. That’s this weekend and I’m actually excited about it instead of anxious.

Having my life together made dating feel possible instead of embarrassing. I’m not ashamed to tell someone what I do or how I spend my time anymore.

## What actually changed in 60 days:

The obvious external changes are better job, more money, better shape, cleaner apartment, actual routine. But the internal transformation is what really matters.

I have direction now. I’m not just drifting through life hoping things work out. I have goals I’m actively working toward. I have a career path I’m building. I have skills I’m developing. I’m moving forward instead of stagnating.

I have energy. Real sustained energy from good sleep and exercise and proper nutrition. I’m not constantly foggy and drained from staying up until 3am eating garbage and never moving.

I have self respect. For years I knew I was wasting my potential and it made me hate myself. Now I’m proud of what I’m doing with my time. I respect the person I see in the mirror.

I have social connection again. Real friendships, potential relationship, community at the gym. I’m not isolated anymore.

I have financial security. Savings growing every month, budget that works, no stress about unexpected expenses. I’m building toward actual financial stability.

Most importantly, I proved to myself I can change. I’m not stuck. I’m not helpless. I can set a goal and achieve it if I have the right system.

## The reality, I fucked up along the way

This wasn’t perfect. There were days I slept until 8am instead of 6:30am. Days I skipped workouts. Days I wasted an hour on YouTube. Days I wanted to give up because maintaining discipline is exhausting.

But I didn’t let one bad day destroy everything. That was the key difference from every other time I’d tried to change. I just got back on track the next day instead of using it as an excuse to quit entirely.

The plan specifically told me that missing days doesn’t reset progress. You just continue from where you are. That mindset saved me from spiraling after slip ups.

## If you want to reset your life:

Stop waiting for motivation or the perfect moment. You’ll never feel completely ready. You just have to start from wherever you are right now.

Find a complete structured plan that covers everything, not just one area of life. You need sleep, exercise, career, finances, social life, all addressed simultaneously because they all affect each other.

Start from your actual current baseline, not where you wish you were. If you wake up at noon, don’t plan for 5am. Start with 11am and build gradually.

Use external systems to enforce discipline. Block your distractions, automate your savings, schedule your workouts. Don’t rely on willpower alone because it will fail.

Follow the plan exactly even when you don’t feel like it. The plan knows better than your moment to moment emotions. Trust the structure.

Track everything obsessively. Seeing your progress will motivate you to keep going when it gets hard.

Accept you’ll have bad days and just get back on track. Don’t use slip ups as permission to quit.

Give it 60 days minimum. That’s how long it takes for real change to solidify. Anything less and you’re just suffering through temporary motivation.

## Final thoughts

60 days ago I was 25 years old living a directionless, mediocre life. Dead end job, no friends, no savings, no health, no relationships, no purpose. Just existing in comfortable numbness while wasting my twenties.

Now I’m 25 with a real career, savings growing, in the best shape I’ve been in since college, rebuilding my social life, dating again, and actually building toward something instead of just drifting.

Two months. That’s all it took to completely reset my life from directionless to focused and growing.

Two months from now you could be unrecognizable. Or you could be exactly where you are now, just older and more stuck.

Find a system, remove distractions, follow the structure, and don’t quit when it gets hard. Your future self is begging you to start today.

Start right now. Not tomorrow, not Monday, right now. Download Reload, build your plan, and begin. Sixty days from now you’ll thank yourself.

Message me if you need help or accountability. I was stuck and directionless for years. If I can reset my life in 60 days, you can too.

Start today.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1767487402.0,Discipline,1,0.67,False

1q3bbho,https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/1q3bbho/short_story_about_peacefully_protesting/,Short Story about Peacefully Protesting.,"This morning I woke up awfully early(for me) and opened reddit to see all the videos of the bombings we conducted on Venezuela in the early hours, and me not having any plans decided to stop just complaining online or in my mind and actually go out and simply hold a sign. 

I have friends from Venezuela that I met at work and they are some of the kindest people you'll ever meet and it affected me so I found some cardboard and simply wrote ""Venezuela? Don't forget about Epstein""

It was 10 degrees and I stood on main street in Johnson for 4 hours and simply held the sign as one would, and I couldnt believe the positive support that was received. So many people honked their horns or waved, I had 5 separate people either bring me coffee or offer to go get me coffee and thanked me. I expected some backlash but not one single middle finger or anyone yelling at me. I saw 4 postal employees drive by and all of them honked and waved which I found pretty surprising. 

The only negative experience was when a woman who showed up to her place of work that I was standing near. I was on a public sidewalk and not obstructing anything, just near the buisness. She told me when the owners got there they would have me removed. Simply told her that they can try, but it's my first amendment right and I wasn't moving. Nothing of it happened. 

I don't know the purpose of this post, other than to say I love the people in this state and the level-headed nature of you/them and the kindness and positivity I received by simply holding a sign. Keep up the good work Vermont. 

I'll be out there again very soon. If you see me, come say hi. And again, don't forget about the Epstein files.

We *know* grief.

But here’s what we \*can\* do: love them, support them, be there for them, help them and we can have empathy by remembering what it was like the last time \*we\* lost someone special.

Some people need lots of attention and hugs and togetherness.

Others need space.

Some might be buried under a pile of tasks. They might accept help, they might not, but we can always ask.

We can offer to cook for them and take the daily jobs off their plate as we know grief can be all consuming and there is a lot of busywork.

We can send them gentle reminders that we are here for them, that we are holding them in our hearts, that we are thinking of them.

We can tell them there is no pressure to respond or return texts/calls as we just wanted to deliver our message without any expectations.

We can tell them we are so sorry, so sad for them, that if they need to talk, we’ll be glad to listen. If they need a break or a distraction, we will be glad to visit, meet for lunch or coffee or etc.

We can choose to lean in when it might (for some) feel a little awkward and uncomfortable, because the last thing we need for anyone in grief is for them to feel isolated, alienated, and alone in it because it’s woo-woo feelings and no one knows what to do.

Give a shit, kids. We just give a shit. Just keep it real.

I'm very, very alone. I travel for work most weeks, so I'm used to traveling alone. I decided to take a trip for myself, and I'm fucking miserable.

The irony wasn't lost on me. Turns out, this isn't just a me problem. Our brains are literally rewiring themselves to crave distraction. I've compiled insights from neuroscience research, productivity experts, and real world experiments to figure out what actually works. Not the recycled ""put your phone away"" advice everyone parrots, but the stuff that addresses why we're so screwed in the first place.

Here's the thing nobody wants to admit. Your inability to focus isn't a character flaw. It's a predictable response to an environment designed to hijack your attention. Social media platforms employ literal neuroscientists to make their apps more addictive. Your dopamine system is getting hammered by engineered stimuli that didn't exist 15 years ago. But understanding the mechanism is half the battle, and there are concrete strategies that actually rewire your brain back to baseline.

**Start with dopamine detox protocols but do them right.** Most people think this means sitting in a dark room for 24 hours. That's idiotic. Dr. Andrew Huberman's research on dopamine regulation shows that the key is reducing dopamine spikes from cheap sources, especially in the morning. First 90 minutes after waking, no phone, no music, no podcast, no coffee. Just boring human existence. Sounds miserable but it recalibrates your baseline dopamine so regular tasks don't feel insufferable by comparison. The Huberman Lab podcast episode on dopamine is genuinely life changing, he breaks down the neurochemistry in ways that make you understand why scrolling feels good but leaves you depleted.

**Environmental design beats willpower every single time.** Cal Newport covers this extensively in Deep Work, probably the best book written on focus in the modern era. Newport's a computer science professor at Georgetown who doesn't use social media at all and somehow thrives professionally. The book won awards for a reason. His core argument is that deep work, the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks, is becoming simultaneously more rare and more valuable. He provides frameworks for structuring your day around depth rather than reactivity. This book made me completely restructure how I approach my work schedule. The philosophy is simple but the implementation requires actual commitment, which is why most people read it, nod along, then change nothing.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that takes books like Deep Work and transforms them into personalized audio content with adaptive learning plans. Built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers, it pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create customized podcasts tailored to your goals. You can adjust the depth from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples. The voice customization is genuinely addictive, ranging from a smoky, sexy tone like Samantha from Her to sarcastic or energetic styles depending on your mood. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about your specific struggles, and it builds a learning plan based on that. It's been useful for replacing mindless scrolling time with actual growth.

**Create friction for bad habits and reduce it for good ones.** Keep your phone in a different room during work blocks. Not on silent. Not face down. In another room. Use website blockers like Cold Turkey that are genuinely hard to bypass, the kind where you'd need to restart your computer to disable. I use the Focus app which locks me out of distracting sites for preset time blocks. The beauty is that the 10 seconds of friction required to override it is usually enough for your prefrontal cortex to regain control and be like ""wait, what the fuck am I doing.""

**Time blocking is non negotiable.** Not a suggestion, not something to try when you feel like it. Every Sunday, map out your entire week in 30 minute blocks. Include everything: deep work sessions, email checking (batched into specific slots), gym, meals, even rest periods. This isn't about being robotic, it's about being intentional. When every hour has a job, you stop making dozens of micro decisions throughout the day about what to work on next. Decision fatigue is real and it demolishes focus.

**The Pomodoro Technique actually works if you don't bastardize it.** 25 minutes of pure focus, 5 minute break, repeat. After four cycles, take a longer 15-30 minute break. The key is that during those 25 minutes, you do ONE thing. Not one thing with Slack open. One thing. Period. There's a reason this technique has survived decades, it aligns with natural attention spans and builds focus stamina incrementally.

**Mindfulness meditation is the closest thing to a cheat code.** Sam Harris's Waking Up app is insanely good for this. Harris is a neuroscientist and philosopher who's spent years studying consciousness and meditation practices. The app strips away all the woo woo nonsense and gives you practical exercises for training attention. Just 10 minutes daily makes a measurable difference in your ability to notice when your mind wanders and redirect it. Meta awareness, the ability to observe your own thought patterns, is the foundation of sustained focus.

**Understand that multitasking is a cognitive myth.** Your brain doesn't actually do two things simultaneously, it rapidly switches between tasks. Every switch incurs a cognitive cost called attention residue. Research from Sophie Leroy shows that when you switch from Task A to Task B, your attention doesn't immediately follow, part of it remains stuck thinking about Task A. This is why you feel scattered when you're constantly context switching. Batch similar tasks together and protect your deep work blocks like they're sacred.

**Audit your inputs ruthlessly.** Everything you consume, whether it's social media, news, podcasts, youtube videos, shapes your mental state and your ability to focus. High quality inputs lead to high quality outputs. I deleted TikTok not because I'm morally superior but because I noticed my attention span deteriorating in real time. The app is genuinely engineered to destroy sustained focus. If you can't delete it, at least set hard time limits through your phone's screen time settings.

**Build focus incrementally.** If you currently can't focus for more than 5 minutes, don't aim for 4 hour deep work sessions. Start with 15 minutes of focused work, then gradually increase. Your attention is like a muscle, it responds to progressive overload. Expecting immediate transformation sets you up for failure and self loathing.

The brutal truth is that deep work requires sacrifice. You can't maintain constant availability and also produce your best work. You can't consume infinite content and also create meaningful output. But once you experience the satisfaction of losing yourself in focused work, of producing something you're genuinely proud of, the dopamine hits from scrolling feel pathetic by comparison.",1,1767486809.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

First time posting on Reddit so apologies if I screwed something up. Anyways, I've lived on my own for over a decade, but the last two years have been brutal workwise. On top of that, insurance and other living expenses have soared. As a result, I'm going to put some feelers out for a roommate. Not in a major rush. Maybe February or early March? I want it to be a good fit for both of us. Maybe meet for coffee, check out each other's current places for dealbreakers, and get a feel for neighborhoods/place preferences before making the leap to live together. I just want to be deliberate to avoid any situations that aren’t a great fit. I’ve just enjoyed my peace and quiet for a long time so this is a big change for me!

I'd like to keep rent under $1500. My only necessities are parking and in-unit washer/dryer. I keep my place pretty clean. I have enough furniture to furnish an entire place. Not sure what I'll keep or get rid of yet. My credit score is high. I'm self-employed so I rely on tax returns to get approved for stuff. My income from this past year should still be high enough for a decent place if combined with someone else's. 

About me: I don't drink or smoke. I hardly ever have people over. I wake up pretty early to go to the gym in the mornings and I go to bed by 10-10:30pm. Mostly introverted.

Entertainment industry was the thing that brought me to LA in the first place. This was one of the industries that were hit hard in the last two years as anyone in industry can attest to. I have some recording and video equipment that I use frequently so I keep it out all the time. I also play guitar quite a bit. I'm thinking of learning some other instruments too. That's why I'd probably do best with other creative types, or someone who doesn't mind the music. But I’m open to making concessions to make it a pleasant living situation. A plus if you work in the entertainment industry, or are a musician.

LGBTQ friendly. Male or female okay. Have lived with both way back when. I have no pets. Don't mind if you do. As long as they're chill.  

I work from home, but that might be changing. I'm trying to change careers and most of the roles I'm targeting are located in DTLA. That's why I'd prefer to stay on the east side near Echo Park, Silverlake... maybe as far as Highland Park, Eagle Rock, Glendale. Might consider further away if it's a great place and a steal. Don’t really want to live in DTLA though.

1q3b4kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1q3b4kn/i_27_m_left_confused_after_recent_reconnection/,I (27 M) left confused after recent reconnection with ex (27 F),"Im M 27 and my ex (F 27) is a fearful avoidant and has high functioning autism and bpd. We dated for almost a year it was very tumultuous and had many ups and downs but not due to her it was mostly me. I was a mess. I never really saw much of her avoidance besides sometimes jumping to break ups really quickly just for me to fight for her and reassure her. we broke up end of july and didnt speak for 2 weeks. I had gone to help her move but was unhappy with some of the ways she had been treating me lately so I was in a mood/rude. She was stressed and said if im going to be like that I should just leave. So I did. It triggered trauma in her due to her previous ex doing something similar. We reconnected and made up but decided not to pursue anything further due to me leaving for army bootcamp in 2 weeks and due to how unstable our relationship was. She was originally going to stay with me even though shes very against long distance but due to that breakup and how the past month had been it was a nogo. In our relationship she shared I was the first guy she ever truly loved and it was evident with how often she showed up for me and stood by me and kept fighting for our relationship.

We spoke a little while I was in bootcamp. eventually i wrote her a letter saying if she was open to it i would like to try to rebuild our relationship. I said if she was okay with that we could talk if not to just tell me to move on. she said she wanted to talk. when i left bootcamp to go to my training i tried to have that talk with her but then she told me she enjoys being single and focusing on herself. (For context, For the past 11 years shes been in and out of relationships. her last one before me she shared she grieved it while in it and met me about 2 months after and we started dating) while i was hurt she didn't just tell me that originally i understood and was happy for her. When I pressed her on why she didnt just tell me that she went purely to the logistics of how long Id be gone for still (over 20 weeks) and how she doesnt want to do long distance. She also exaggerated how long I would be gone for i believe she said 46 weeks. At that point I started no contact and that was october 31st.

I ended up reaching out to her because I was going to be back in town for thanksgiving and asked if i could see her. She said shed be happy to make time for me. We went out had fun and ran into some of my friends went back to hers and we were intimate. the next day we got coffee and then she offered to take me home i said sure and then she kept extending the car ride (asking if she could take the long canyon way and then also asking to take a 25 minute detour to get gas from costco). We then texted pretty much from that point till today. It was hot and cold some days shed send me music or a playlist, the next be super dry, then shed send me movie recs i would like, then be dry again. I would just let the convo die and stop messaging her sometimes and then she would eventually restart the convo. she was sstudying for finals during this time and i told her feel free to call me if ur bored. She never did that week and so i never asked again. but the next week she called me on the weekend both days unprompted and we talked for a few hours.

Now I was just in town for the holidays and I asked to see her again and so we went out the day I got back and went out with my friends again. This time she was a little more distant with me I noticed. went back to hers again we had sex again and then i left the next morning. On my way home she sent me some memes on instagram, and then i asked to see her again and she said shed lmk. I realized this was probably a good point to clarify intentions. I asked if we could do that and it was right before christmas so she said we could do it later in the week and shed lmk. Christmas comes around and the day after I text her because I hadnt heard anything about us meeting for intentions and I just asked her. Here she told me that while we had fun she didnt feel anything romantic and was also not in a place to where she is looking for anything romantic. she also told me she is enjoying finally focusing on herself with the single life and not jumping into a relationship. I was happy for her and accepted it.

I later reached out asking for clarification on what the past month was then because it confused me. and we decided to have a talk. She rescheduled it multiple times, switched it to a dinner, then renegged and swithced it to a phone call and then rescheduled again and finally we had the call. On the call i asked her if she was in her avoidance and if that was why she kept pushing the call and she said yes. I then apologized to her for my part in the issues i created in the relationship and the pain I caused her. I apologized for walking out that day and abandoning her and not being able to provide her emotional safety. I also apologized for how when I left for bootcamp she essentially had to deal with everything herself. I shared with her how I have been trying to fix all of the problems I had she shared how shocked and surprised and proud she was of me how i addressed and fixed all those problems with myself. She cried multiple times in this call and admitted to repressing alot about our relationship and breakup to where she forgot about me walking out. she shared with me after our breakup she ""hated men"" and has been extremely emotionally unavailable. she told me the past few times we saw eachother were really nice and she had a lot of fun and they were easy but that she was just going with the flow and like she shared before, didnt feel anything romantic(which in my opinion how would you if ur not open to it). she also shared that she wonders who im with when she watches my stories and sees me out. she also shared the past few times we saw eachother was the safest she ever felt with me. she knows I still love her and thinks it best i go no contact and I agreed. we ended the call on a good note and i had to give her a bday gift that i got so she asked me to come over to give her a hug and give it.

this confused me more. The crying, the repression, the admitting to avoidance, the emotional unavailability. If she feels nothing and is over me completely and has moved on why is she still feeling these things? I know when I've been in her same exact emotional position before all of that was because I still loved and was mourning my ex.

I ended up drunk calling her last night and jsut telling her that and telling her im confused. Shes telling me shes moved on but if shes moved on in my brain those things shouldnt be there or have happened. she told me she shouldnt have said some of the things on the call and that she wants me to move on. I heard her crying on this call as well. I then texted her today and when I mentioned to her that I think there are more feelings than she wants to admit and that I think shes in her avoidance because if there were no feelings she wouldnt be repressing, she wouldnt be crying, she wouldnt be having jealous thoughts, she wouldnt be emotionally unavailable. she asked me to stop reading into her feelings and that it isnt my job anymore. So I eneded the convo we said some goodbyes and now im entering no contact with her and moving on. I know doing what I did doesnt help with avoidants but i just needed to call out what I was seeing.

(Something to point out i still have 5 months left of training till im back home for good. Everytime we ended things except now it always was with a hopeful tinge for example (""i dont know where the future will take us"" or ""for the forseeable future"") im not sure if that was her just trying to let me down softly or if it was her also keeping hope alive.)

I want to respect her space and her wanting to be single. I also am not in the mindset of trying to get her back. I understand i need to move on. I guess my thing is I dont want to be delusional, I dont want to hold out hope. I dont want to assume its avoidance when it could be just dissinterest and she really is over me. But when I think about it some of that stuff just doesnt make sense and the only thing that does is her avoidance that she even admitted she was dealing with rn. If youre over me why see me multiple times and hookup w me? why cry? why get jealous? why still be emotionally unavailable? why repress? those from my own personal expereince are symptoms of feeling too much not nothing at all. Am i being delusional here or is my take most accurate?",0,1767486654.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

I would love to get to know you!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one special someone that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in a real, genuine connection and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of meeting a long term partner, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring person. An individual that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in that special someone. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is ready to make it work with a guy named shadow\_surf haha.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a partner?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* Loyal, trusting, and honest
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

(Might make into a series later on if interest is there, let me know) Give credit where due please. Thanks for reading","Dear Diary,  
**(excited tone**) I saw them again today, I sat behind them in history class, the only class without seating assignments, my favorite.  They smelt like sweet summer rain with a hint of apricots, and the way they scratch their neck when they don’t know an answer when the teacher calls on them is so adorable. Their pinky finger is in the air as if drinking tea, while the other three curl into their neck, biting like a friendly viper. *\*laughs\** If you look close enough you can see a single sweat drop start to form as well from their left ear due to their nerves.  And don’t get me started on the way that one tuft of hair misbehaves and just sits on the top of their head. They were dressed up today too, instead of their usual attire of causal sporty-- dockers and a sweater vest. The vest they were wearing really brought out the specks of golden within their deep brown eyes as well. A person could get lost within them if they look to long…

Monday  
**(slightly annoyed tone**) I don’t have any classes with them today, so I only get to see them in the hallways and at lunch times. I get to my classes as fast as I can so I can sit by the door to see them walk by. I know them by their footsteps now. Some would say that it is a little obsessive, but I would say it’s very observant. It’s a step, slide, step, bounce, step—with the bounce being their keychain on their backpack. It’s a cute little corgi dog winking, which begs to answer the question if they are a cat or dog person. Personally, I think cats are better, they are more independent and can take care of themselves and are less people pleasing, but then dogs do have their qualities. They can be trained a lot easier and are a lot more loyal to their master. One master that is. You can make them do anything and they will protect you, given enough time and patience. With on the topic of them, I have all the patience and time within the world to give to them…

Tuesday  
**(slightly cocky tone**) I find out where they work today, a little mom and pop bakery and coffee shop. Their little uniform is charming on them. So neat and tidy on them it is, or it was until some jackass made them spill their order of coffee on it staining it for the rest of their shift. **(sad tone**) My poor little poppet. **(slightly cocky tone)** Oh but they comp it with their own money and remade it, so kind they are, but really my poppet shouldn’t have had to do that. It was not their fault at all. That type of behavior will get people to walk all over you and they will need to learn to stand up for themselves better, or at least have someone watching over them so people know that they are not someone weak to be preyed upon for their kindness. My poppet is way to kind for their own good….  
  


Wednesday  
**(panic tone)** They were not at school today! Are they sick? Are they hurt? Did they have an appointment that took the whole day? Where could they have gone? I went walking by their job as well and they were not there. It was some tall, annoying girl behind the counter instead who ask what I wanted. Girl, you have nothing there that I want, my poppet obviously wasn’t there so why would I care about wanting an iced coffee or a blueberry scone? I don’t know where my little poppet is today and I feel so depressed. My chest feels tight and I feel like I can’t breathe right. Will they be at school tomorrow? What if they are really sick and are going to be out of school for more than a couple of days? Or worse! What if they are moving away? No, that’s the worst case scenario that I’m just jumping to, no one can move away that fast that quickly on their own. \**laughs\** Especially not at that job they had, it doesn’t pay them even to save up to move. No, no no. My poppet has to be sick, but if they are sick they are alone and my poor little poppet! How alone and afraid they must be feeling! If only I knew where they were, I would take care of them. I would I would I would! They wouldn’t have to face any sickness alone ever again…

Thursday

**(relieved tone)** Ah, my poppet is back at school today, thanks heavens! It turns out they had an appointment and then just decided to take the rest of the day off as a me day. Which I can understand, yet I’m still annoyed that I didn’t know they were so stressed out that they needed a me day or were told that they needed a day off from school anyway. Don’t they know how much **just** seeing them makes my day.  
  
Anyway, I noticed that they tend to get the same thing to eat a lot; a chicken sandwich, apple, bottle of water, and a pack of skittles. Not the healthiest of choices, they need to take better care of themselves. If I could cook for them I would make them some chicken fajitas or chicken stew. It would at least get them some vegetables into their diet, I haven’t seen them eat one at all this week. Plus it would be something hot and tasty instead of the stale dry sandwich they bring every day in a paper bag…

Friday  
**(excited tone)** Ah! My favorite day again! I got to sit behind them! *\*hehe\** Ah, it was so joyous, I was so so close to them that if I just reached out I could have touched them. I wonder what they feel like? Is their skin smooth or rough from working at the coffee shop? Ah, that tuft of hair looks like it would be the softest material on Earth. Softer than anything I have ever felt and will. I just want to run my finger through it and curl it around while laying my head on their chest. I’m sure their heartbeat is warm and strong too, oh if I was that close to them the smell of apricots would probably be stronger. I just have to be patient a little bit longer. For they will be mine. It’s not a sometime but a someday. They don’t know they are my poppet, but I’m thinking of leaving a note in their locker. Locker 239. *\*laughs\** Ah, I can see that next week is going to be the start of a wonderful time for me and my poppet and I can’t wait!",3,1767486620.0,ASMRScriptHaven,0,1.0,False
1q3b19v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BudgetBasics/comments/1q3b19v/why_budgets_fail_a_nobs_guide_to_why_your_money/,Why Budgets Fail: A No-BS Guide to Why Your Money Plan Crashes and Burns (And How to Salvage the Wreckage),"I’ve been knee-deep in budgeting hell for years—first as a broke college kid eating ramen like it was a gourmet trend, then as an adult pretending I have my act together. But let’s face it: budgets fail more often than New Year’s resolutions. Why? Because they’re not magic spells; they’re fragile ecosystems that we humans love to sabotage. In this post, I’ll break down the top reasons budgets implode, with some real talk, a dash of humor (because crying over spilled milk—er, lattes—isn’t productive), and tips to fix it. Buckle up; your wallet might thank me later.

1. Unrealistic Expectations: Dreaming Big, Failing Spectacularly

Picture this: You sit down with a spreadsheet, channeling your inner Warren Buffett, and declare, “I’m only spending $50 on groceries this month!” Meanwhile, your fridge is empty, and inflation is laughing in the background. Budgets fail when they’re built on fairy tales rather than reality.

Why it happens: We overestimate our willpower and underestimate costs. Life isn’t a straight line—gas prices spike, your dog eats a sock (vet bill: $300), or you “deserve” that takeout after a rough day.

The humor in the horror: It’s like planning a diet where dessert is forbidden, but then you discover ice cream has feelings too and doesn’t want to be left out.

Educational fix: Start by tracking your actual spending for a month (use apps like Mint or YNAB). Base your budget on real data, not aspirations. Aim for the 50/30/20 rule: 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings/debt. Adjust as needed—budgets are living documents, not stone tablets.

2. Not Tracking Expenses: The “Out of Sight, Out of Mind” Trap

You craft a beautiful budget, pat yourself on the back, and then… forget about it. Expenses pile up like unread emails, and suddenly you’re wondering why your bank account looks like it survived a zombie apocalypse.

Why it happens: Tracking is tedious. Swiping a card feels painless until the statement arrives. Small leaks (that $5 coffee here, $10 app subscription there) sink the ship without you noticing.

The humor in the horror: It’s the financial equivalent of stepping on a Lego—tiny, but oh boy, does it hurt when you add them up. “I’ll just buy this one thing,” you say, as your budget whispers, “Famous last words.”

Educational fix: Make tracking automatic. Link your accounts to budgeting software that categorizes spends in real-time. Set weekly check-ins: Sunday night with a glass of wine (or water, if you’re budgeting). Pro tip: Categorize everything—yes, even that impulse buy of novelty socks.

3. Impulse Buying: The Siren Song of “Retail Therapy”

Ah, the classic: You’re scrolling Amazon at 2 AM, and boom—$80 on gadgets you didn’t know existed. Budgets crumble under the weight of unchecked wants masquerading as needs.

Why it happens: Dopamine hits from shopping are real, folks. Marketing geniuses design it that way—flash sales, “limited time only,” and targeted ads that know you better than your therapist.

The humor in the horror: Impulse buying is like adopting a puppy on a whim: Cute at first, but soon you’re cleaning up messes and wondering why your life is chaos. “But it was on sale!” is the battle cry of the financially doomed.

Educational fix: Implement a 24-48 hour rule: Add to cart, wait, and revisit. Unsubscribe from promo emails (your inbox will thank you). Build a “fun fund” in your budget for guilt-free splurges, but cap it. Remember, true wealth is freedom, not stuff.

4. Ignoring Irregular Expenses: The Sneaky Assassin

Budgets often cover rent, groceries, and bills—but what about car repairs, holidays, or that annual Prime renewal? These “forgotten” costs ambush you like a plot twist in a bad thriller.

Why it happens: We focus on monthly predictable stuff and ignore the lumpy ones. Human brains aren’t great at long-term planning; we’d rather deal with now than later.

The humor in the horror: It’s like inviting friends to a party but forgetting to buy food—everyone shows up, and suddenly you’re scrambling. “Oh right, Christmas happens every year? Who knew!”

Educational fix: List all annual/irregular expenses (insurance, gifts, vacations). Divide by 12 and sock away that amount monthly into a sinking fund. Tools like Excel or apps can forecast these—treat them like VIPs in your budget party.

5. No Emergency Fund: When Life Throws Curveballs (And You Swing Blindly).

Without a safety net, one unexpected event—a layoff, medical bill, or appliance rebellion—derails everything. Your budget becomes a house of cards in a windstorm.

Why it happens: Building an emergency fund takes time and sacrifice. Many live paycheck-to-paycheck, where saving feels impossible.

The humor in the horror: It’s the plot of every sitcom episode: “Honey, the car’s on fire!” Cue laugh track as your budget evaporates. Murphy’s Law loves the unprepared.

Educational fix: Aim for 3-6 months of expenses in a high-yield savings account. Start small—$1,000 goal first. Automate transfers post-payday. Think of it as insurance against life’s pranks; it’s not “if” but “when” you’ll need it.

6. Psychological Barriers: The Mind Games We Play. 

Budgets don’t fail because money is emotional. Denial (“I’m not that bad with money”), guilt, or even sabotage from past traumas sneak in.

Why it happens: We’re wired for instant gratification, not delayed rewards. Societal pressure to “keep up” adds fuel to the fire.

The humor in the horror: Your brain: “Save for retirement? But what if I die tomorrow and miss out on this artisanal cheese?” Cue existential crisis over cheddar.

Educational fix: Mindset shift: View budgeting as self-care, not punishment. Read books like “The Psychology of Money” by Morgan Housel. Join communities (like this sub) for accountability. Celebrate wins—small ones count!

Wrapping It Up: Budgets Aren’t Doomed—You Just Need a Better Blueprint
Budgets fail not because they’re flawed concepts, but because we treat them like set-it-and-forget-it infomercial gadgets. With realistic planning, consistent tracking, and a buffer for human error (and humor), you can make one stick. I’ve turned my financial dumpster fire into a cozy campfire—it’s possible for you.

Budgets flop due to unrealism, poor tracking, impulses, forgotten costs, no safety net, and brain tricks. Fix with data, automation, rules, and mindset hacks. Laugh it off, then level up.",0,1767486418.0,BudgetBasics,0,0.5,False

Hey. There is a lot I could say about myself, but the most important is I stay grounded for those who I care for. I live a sort of quiet life, with my writing and drawing, but recently I have found enjoyment in small adventures.

A relationship with me is one where we could either co-op a game, share a book, or have a fun day at an arcade. And one day I'd enjoy to just sit with my partner in a park field, just enjoying the peace. And if we ever run into bumps, I may take a little time to collect myself, but after I always come back ready to listen.

The woman I'm looking for is a passionate one, the type who can go on and on about the things she loves. And I always find myself falling for the shy and introverted girls with nerdy hobbies and strong values. I'm most drawn to a cute face, slim to athletic build, and a sweet smile with expressive eyes.

A side note, Final Fantasy is my favorite series (obviously), and I'm aiming cosplay Cloud in con season. So if you think you can rock a good Tifa, Aerith, or even Yuffie, then you're my type. Though if you got other ideas, feel free to say them. And yeah, we'll be the couple that gets others inspired.

Hey. There is a lot I could say about myself, but the most important is I stay grounded for those who I care for. I live a sort of quiet life, with my writing and drawing, but recently I have found enjoyment in small adventures.

A relationship with me is one where we could either co-op a game, share a book, or have a fun day at an arcade. And one day I'd enjoy to just sit with my partner in a park field, just enjoying the peace. And if we ever run into bumps, I may take a little time to collect myself, but after I always come back ready to listen.

The woman I'm looking for is a passionate one, the type who can go on and on about the things she loves. And I always find myself falling for the shy and introverted girls with nerdy hobbies and strong values. I'm most drawn to a cute face, slim to athletic build, and a sweet smile with expressive eyes.

My wife had told me while I was taking a nap, and explained that there was something wrong with the pipes. When I finished drinking my coffee, I decided to work on the kitchen sink. I noticed that they were leaking. So much, in fact, that there were two buckets full.
So, while she watched infographics on the television, I decided to go to a nearby appliance store to get new pipes. I chose these ones from a company called Hector Industries, and it seemed pretty different from other pipes.
I was always a strange child, and I noticed things differently than other people. I knew when something looked different from the rest - and this pipe looked very different.
When I got home, I immediately installed the pipe to the kitchen sink. It fit perfectly! In fact, it was very smug. Little did I know, the next few days was going to be torture.

The problems started the next day. My wife was asleep, but I was downstairs washing the dishes, as I had just finished eating a bowl of cereal. I turned on the sink, but water didn't come out.
Instead, a red, gooey substance came out, and as soon as it started, it ended. I put my finger underneath the faucet and let a drip of the stuff go onto my hand. I licked it.
It had a strong metallic taste. It tasted familiar - so familiar, in fact, that I almost gagged at the taste. It was blood.
There was blood dripping out of my faucet, and my wife has been asleep all day. She was extremely pale this morning, but I never would've thought that something would come after her.

It was extremely cold outside. Colder than usual. The air was freezing so bad it burned, and my whole body was numb. I was just going outside to check out the water hose outside.
I turned it on, and I immediately wished I hadn't. Blood sprayed everywhere, and chunks of something was coming out with it.
I stopped it immediately and grabbed a chunk. It was cold, wet and slimy, but it was unmistakable. Meat.
But where had it come from? Yes, that was the question in my mind.

The moment I slipped into bed, something felt wrong. My wife was still asleep. She hadn't woken all day, and her eyes were closer. I gently shook her.
“Sweetie, wake up,” I pleaded. No response. I shook her harder, and then I saw her face.
It was extremely pale, with her mouth wide open. Around her eye sockets was blood, and I could see what was left of an artery. I called the police.
They arrested me almost immediately, and I had no choice. I was the murderer. I killed her. How, you ask? Not even I know the answer to that.

I still don't know what the problem is with my kitchen sink.",3,1767485669.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1 my mom’s chocolate cheesecake that I used to bake for a café I owned in Joshua tree.   
2 Ben & Jerry’s fudge brownie ice cream (Trader Joe’s chocolate ice cream is up there too!).  
3 the hot fudge sundae at Willow restaurant at Mirbau hotel/spas… tons of amazing dessert junk in there under a chocolate globe thing that they melt by pouring hot fudge on it.   
4 Any super high quality dark chocolate bar that has raspberry or strawberry shujz/goop inside each piece, like Godiva/lindt or better.  
5 A good choc pot du crene or mousse, any place that makes it incredibly.  
6 outstanding teramisu. They’re usually not chocolatey, but we’re thinking of a place in a small town called Tivoli New York that puts a layer of cocoa shavings or cocoa nibs on it so great.    
7 used to be that Stewart’s gas stations inconvenience stores in upstate New York and the most amazing hot fudge that I would buy it by the 16 ounce coffee cup full. I think they cheap ended up and it’s not so gooey and leathery and the more burnt as the better taste anymore, but still fond memories.   
8 I’m a sentimental fool, and still think very fondly of Drake’s from my childhood in New York City, like ringings and yodels, and even those nasty ass, funny bones, back when they were made with real chocolate.  
9 Lu or similar dark chocolate school boy cookies and the really hard to find dark chocolate covered wafers.  
10 dark chocolate covered CELLO cherries.    
11 Lacey’s cookies in dark.  
- trying to think of really amazing desserts from fancy restaurants that we’ve been to. I don’t think I would take most of the above over the big foofy cakes at those places.

I think my mom has undiagnosed depression because she always seems to perceive the world in such a negative view.

When I was younger, I was depressed and sometimes cried when close friendships ended and I was lonely often. I didn't want to or know how to do things that could get me out of that state of mind. My mom thinks I'm depressed because I don't work(I have enough money and very good with finance that it's not a problem to me), I enjoy not working because I sleep well, and never stress. My mom is constantly complaining about her life being miserable and lonely, meanwhile I just enjoy life without stress, watch TV, drink some coffee, cook some good food, listen to good music. I remember when I was at the low points in my life when I wasn't enjoying much and just felt sick, like I was on drugs and didn't have an appetite. A while back a doctor had prescribed me antidepressants for some minor sleep issues I had. She didn't tell me it was an antidepressant, but I was not myself. I was constantly tired, my mind was empty, and was constantly hungry when not sleeping. I gained 10lbs in two weeks and just felt dead so I stopped taking it and feel much better now.

1q3anr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fanartfrenzyevent/comments/1q3anr2/art_type_spotlight_playlists_and_mixtapes/,Art Type Spotlight - Playlists and Mixtapes,"Playlists and mixtapes (songs curated in a list to represent, be played alongside, or embody the vibes of a fic, either digitally or on physical media like a tape or CD) are great options for this event. I’m sure most of you have made playlists and have favorite sites for this already, but we’ve compiled some resources, tutorials, and information you may find helpful regardless, including information on making mixtapes/CDs, as well as a comparison of a few alternate playlist-making sites if you’re looking to expand beyond Spotify and Youtube, and places to find new music.

**Potential ways to connect to a fic:** 

There are a few different ways to connect a playlist or mixtape to a fic. You can pick songs that fit the general vibe or remind you of the author’s interpretation of the characters, or songs with lyrics that relate to the plot or how the relationships in the fic are developing. You can create a playlist meant to be listened to in order while reading the fic, that progresses along with the plot as a formal soundtrack, or use all instrumental tracks to create a score. You can make a playlist for a specific scene or relationship within a fic, or make something inspired by the fic as a whole. 

You can make a massive, hours-long playlist or one just long enough for the time it takes to read the scene that inspired it. You can make a digital playlist with cover art, or a physical mixtape with cute packaging. You can write a whole essay laying out your thought process or just write a few sentences explaining each song’s inclusion. There are loads of great ways to make a playlist, get creative and have fun!

**Examples:**

Everyone is likely pretty familiar with playlists in general, but there’s a lot of variety in terms of presentation you may want to consider. For maximum customization, you can make physical mixtapes or CDs, like [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/cassetteculture/comments/1mog4xw/made_my_first_few_mixtapes/) or [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDs/comments/1l1cqqa/photoshopped_covers_for_my_burned_playlists/) with digitally designed labels, or [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/cassetteculture/comments/13trrdz/i_cant_stop_making_mixtapes_i_made_most_of_these/) with fantastic hand-drawn labels. 

Digital playlists have their advantages as well, and are great options. This fanmade [playlist](https://archiveofourown.org/works/76662291) for the TV show Heated Rivalry is an excellent example of how to post on AO3 - the playlist is posted on spotify and embedded directly into the work, followed by an annotated copy of the song list explaining why each song was included and how it relates to their inspiration.

**Resources, tutorials, and where to look for inspiration:**

As fun as it can be, building a playlist from scratch can be a little intimidating. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEnOHoDyYDs) for a quick guide to getting started. 

While the exact method of curation will depend on your format (see instructions for tapes and CDs below), a few general rules apply for any kind of playlist. Things you’ll want to be aware of are flow, variety, tone, and relevance to the fic serving as your inspiration.

If your playlist is meant to be listened to in a specific order rather than shuffled - a playlist designed to follow the plot’s progression or the development of a relationship, or a playlist meant to serve as a soundtrack or score for the fic – flow will be key. This refers to how all of your songs fit together and transition from one to the next. Ideally, you’re aiming for a smooth transition that makes sense logically and feels natural. This is also something you can manipulate and use as a storytelling tool: go against the grain and use a jarring transition to show a twist in the narrative or a sudden shift in the fic’s tone, for example.

To ensure your playlist flows well, think of the songs like a color gradient. A playlist that shows a progression moves the listener from the starting point to an ending point via music, in the same manner as the plot, character, or relationship development you’re trying to mirror does with prose. (If the journey that you’re adapting isn’t smooth, your flow doesn’t necessarily need to be, either – aim to match the source!) You can use changes in tone (light and cheery to gloomy and reflective, then back again, for example), genre, lyrical content (or absence of lyrics) to translate the fic’s progression to music. As with a gradient, the starting and end point can be entirely different. You can start with bubblegum pop and end with death metal and still have a cohesive playlist if the transition is gradual and each song leads into the next in a way that makes sense sonically and thematically. 

With mixtapes and CDs, you have much more control over flow than with digital playlists - you can add longer spaces between songs or drop the listener immediately from one to the next, cut songs off at just the right lyric, duplicate a chunk of the song for emphasis, or add in static and other sounds between songs. You can even drop in recordings of quotes from the fic that fit with the songs you’ve compiled.

If your playlist is designed to be shuffled - an unstructured playlist that’s simply a compilation of songs that remind you of the fic, for example - flow goes out the window. Instead of worrying about how songs transition into each other, your main focus can be on finding songs that fit the vibe, themes, and tone of the fic, and making sure they fit together however they might be shuffled.

Variety is key in all cases - try not to lean too hard on any one artist, and make sure you’re mixing it up a little to keep things interesting.

There are a lot of things you can draw from to find the right songs - a fic’s themes, characters, genre, tone, settings, symbols and important objects, etc. Making a playlist for a fluffy coffee shop AU set in Ontario? Find some lighthearted pop by Canadian artists, and maybe some songs that reference coffee shops and romance, songs with a cozy, comforting feel. If you’re making a playlist for a long, dramatic, plot-heavy fic with lots of twists and turns, you may want to lean more on orchestral and instrumental tracks, gloomier rock and metal. Look for songs that feature lyrics referencing similar themes, events, or emotions. Is the fic set in a certain year or time period? Pick songs that came out during that time period or otherwise evoke the feeling of the era. 

Try to keep things relevant and stick to your artistic vision over your desire to share certain songs that may not fit. Be prepared to kill your darlings here - does that song you love actually fit the playlist, or do you just really want people to listen to [Toilet Rats](https://open.spotify.com/track/5IDIAOcVUE3acIAdXh7ltD)? (I really want people to listen to Toilet Rats.)

Not sure quite what you’re going for yet? You can find a lot of great examples, inspiration, ideas, and help on reddit at [r/playlists](https://www.reddit.com/r/playlists/).

If you’re looking to find new music for your playlists, or songs with specific themes, [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) is a good place to start. Their desktop site allows you to search by genre (and subgenres), artist location, and theme tags. Typing related terms into [Bandcamp.com/discover/INSERTYOURWORDHERE](http://Bandcamp.com/discover/INSERTYOURWORDHERE) can yield useful and interesting results. Writing a fic that prominently features a specific symbol, object, theme, or color? Drop that in and see what comes up.

**Digital Playlists - Commonly-used platforms and other options**

Depending on the type of playlist you’re looking to make, different sites and formats might be better options for you - all the available options have their own strengths and drawbacks. If the themes and vibes of the music that connect to the fic are also present in the music videos/visualizers, Youtube is a great option, but you may need to add some warnings for strobing/gore/etc. depending on the content of the videos in your playlist. If you’re making a playlist that follows a progression or is designed to be played while reading the fic, a physical option like a mixtape or CD that locks the listener in to your order and vision is a great choice. Similarly, if you want to add a lot of personal flair/art into the cover art/packaging, physical media is a good way to go. Digital playlists are generally best in terms of accessibility and ease of distribution and often allow for customized cover art, but the available platforms all come with different drawbacks.

For playlist sharing, the most commonly-used platforms are [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/), and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/) as they are easily embedded into various platforms, including Ao3. Each of these platforms now come with the downsides of allowing AI-generated content, offering generative AI tools for creators, limiting music listening to account holders in the case of Spotify, and in the case of Youtube, your listeners may be required to verify their age to access certain videos.

Alternative free (and partially-free) host sites include [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/en/), [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) and [Audiomack](https://audiomack.com/), which have similar UI designs to Spotify. However, Deezer requires a paid account to listen to full songs, and Audiomack restricts full access to their music library to paid accounts only. We also tested Freefy, a newer option, but it was so riddled with issues that we can’t in good conscience recommend it.

**For a quick comparison of the available options**, we tried making the same playlist on multiple sites. Here’s our base playlist on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7aiHThWKoICKRe462ASHLf?si=Q2Y3iu9DRy67U_4rtZeFzQ) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4frDrMCFqOgbNqmfMXSNz9QGUWVHQ2mx), and the alternates - [Deezer](https://link.deezer.com/s/3231l17izwwjwQZa9fJDE), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/ectocoolerkeg/sets/fanart-frenzy-songs-to-create), and [Audiomack](https://audiomack.com/ectocoolerkeg/playlist/fanart-frenzy-songs-to-create-to).

Spotify is relatively easy to embed in social media posts on tumblr or reddit. The others, being newer and less well-known, can be a little trickier to work with. Of the options we tested, only Spotify, Soundcloud, and Youtube embed properly on AO3. This [image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CdwTuOuFib3U8BM8fDWmD8zzh2tgP_Tq/view) shows how these options look in an AO3 work.

Deezer had everything on the base playlist, but without a paid account, users can only listen to 30 seconds of each song. However, this is still a decent option for building your playlists because of their universal sharing option - anyone who opens your link can easily port your playlist to Spotify, Youtube Music, or Apple Music, depending on which service they use. It offers embedding options, but these are not tumblr- or reddit-friendly and do not appear to work on AO3, either.

Soundcloud had 90% of the base playlist - one missing track, and one track for which we had to opt for a live version. Due to its murky [AI policy](https://futurism.com/soundcloud-ai-terms-of-service), many artists understandably skip Soundcloud for distribution and have removed their work from the platform, so this may be an issue if you choose to use Soundcloud.

Audiomack is even worse in terms of song availability - it only had about 60% of the base playlist, several tracks appear locked to paid accounts, and in one case we had to resort to a live version of a track. While it does allow for extensive customization of the playlist, including the URL, and is one of the better options in terms of artist pay, their library is quite limited, so depending on what you’d like to include on your playlist, Audiomack may not be your best option. It also doesn’t offer an embed feature that works on reddit, tumblr, or AO3.

[Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) may be the most socially-responsible option in terms of artist pay and lack of AI, but it’s also the most expensive option as songs can only be added to a playlist if you own each one. This is a great choice if you already have an extensive library on Bandcamp to pull from! (Note: While this isn’t necessarily a cheap option if you’re starting from scratch, many artists, especially smaller ones, often offer albums and in some cases, their entire catalog, for just a few dollars or pay-what-you-want. Many record companies and distributors on Bandcamp also offer free/pay-what-you-want samplers featuring their artists which can help you build out a library.) Here are [Bandcamp’s instructions](https://get.bandcamp.help/hc/en-us/articles/31999603151127-Playlists-web-BETA) for making a playlist on Bandcamp.

For shorter playlists, you can upload a total of 10 MP3 files under 10MB to Tumblr or link to 10 website URLs per post (it is unclear if there’s a per-day limit for URL linking). You can then embed each individual audio file from your Tumblr post into Ao3. This is not particularly recommended, though we do have a guide in our [Uploading Audio and Video to Ao3](https://www.tumblr.com/fanartfrenzy/799947152798433280/uploading-audio-and-video-to-ao3?source=share) tutorial.

For sharing playlists on Ao3, there are a couple of other options. The first is directly embedding the playlist (see our example [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CdwTuOuFib3U8BM8fDWmD8zzh2tgP_Tq/view)) or playlist songs in the work itself, so people can listen to the playlist without leaving Ao3. (Clicking ‘share’ on your playlist on any of the larger music platforms should give you an option to grab an embed code which you can simply copy and paste into Ao3.) This may not be your best option as some platforms, like Spotify and Soundcloud, require an account to listen to full songs. You can also list out the songs with links to an outside platform, or simply list the songs without links. With any of these options, you should include analytical commentary explaining why these songs are on this playlist and reference the fic throughout. Simply posting a list of songs without providing additional commentary or links to a place to listen to them is not significantly transformative and will likely result in your list being removed by Ao3 for violating their terms of service.

**Physical playlists - Mixtapes and CDs**

While digital playlists are the usual option these days and a great way to fill the playlist prompts, you can also make a physical version with either CDs or cassettes (or 8-tracks, vinyl, etc. if you happen to have a more complicated set-up.)

If you have a computer newer than a few years old, you may need to get an external disc drive in order to burn CDs, however, you may also be able to do this at a computer center at your school, university, or local library. Your local library may also have external disc drives that you can check out via a library of things program, or your school/university may have an AV department/club from which you can rent equipment. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WvmIHnB4wA) is a pretty thorough guide for creating a mix CD. [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQfHsjTQnQs) has instructions for making a mix CD using iTunes, and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbChel8a2EY) has instructions for using Windows Media Player.

For making a mixtape, you’ll need some form of cassette player with a record function. Any of the resources mentioned above may work for acquiring this if you don’t already have one, but you can also find good quality cassette players online, in thrift stores, or at local garage sales if you’ve got time to trawl those. New tape players do exist, but there is currently only one option for the internal mechanisms for anyone manufacturing cassette players, and it’s not a very good one. The new players are not great quality, generally can’t be repaired easily (if at all), and may eat your tapes. You’re much better off buying an older or refurbished model if you’re looking to get into tapes or make mixtapes with any frequency. If you only want to make a few, or just want to try it out for the event, the above-mentioned resources are likely your best bet. You may also have a local AV nerd in your community who will make you a single mixtape for a fairly reasonable price, but the process of making your own is very fun and I highly recommend trying it yourself to get the full experience. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZaeQxVFkw8) outlines the easiest method, and this [thread on r/cassetteculture](https://www.reddit.com/r/cassetteculture/comments/1j3ts6v/how_do_you_make_your_mixtapes/) details a few more you may want to try.

You can get blank tapes, CDs, and cases for both online, at thrift stores, and local record shops if they’re cool. Most big box and warehouse stores still sell blank CDs, and you can also get them at office supply and electronics stores. 

Half the fun of making a mixtape or CD is designing the look of your tape/CD and the packaging - adding your own art, decorations, and flair. This is a great place to add further connection to the fic you’re working with - themed cover art, stickers or little doodles of significant symbols/objects from the fic, characters, settings, etc.

For tapes, there are a lot of options for packaging styles, from the traditional plastic case with a J-Card to cassingle sleeves and more. [This site](https://www.nationalaudiocompany.com/cassette-duplication/prepare-your-audio-and-your-album-art/cassette-art-templates/) has all the templates you need for designing your covers digitally or on paper once printed. I recommend printing on thick cardstock if you’re making a sleeve or U-Card style packaging. For CDs, your options are a bit more limited but no less fun. You can find some options and templates [here](https://www.nationalaudiocompany.com/cd-duplication/cd-duplication-templates-and-forms/). Once you’ve picked a style, all you need to do is load up your design program of choice, or pull out the colored sharpies and stickers, and go nuts.

Here’s an example from us featuring our sample playlist:

For other resources, never underestimate your local library. Librarians are your friends and will not bite you - ask them for help in finding CDs and any devices or equipment you may need! Many libraries offer additional resources such as computers with disc drives, audio software, laser cutting, or a ‘library of things’ where you can rent stereos, cassette or CD players, and other crafting equipment.

1q3am7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1q3am7z/im_really_confused/,im really confused,"Im M 27 and my ex (F 27) is a fearful avoidant and has high functioning autism and bpd. We dated for almost a year it was very tumultuous and had many ups and downs but not due to her it was mostly me. I was a mess. I never really saw much of her avoidance besides sometimes jumping to break ups really quickly just for me to fight for her and reassure her. we broke up end of july and didnt speak for 2 weeks. I had gone to help her move but was unhappy with some of the ways she had been treating me lately so I was in a mood/rude. She was stressed and said if im going to be like that I should just leave. So I did. It triggered trauma in her due to her previous ex doing something similar. We reconnected and made up but decided not to pursue anything further due to me leaving for army bootcamp in 2 weeks and due to how unstable our relationship was. She was originally going to stay with me even though shes very against long distance but due to that breakup and how the past month had been it was a nogo. In our relationship she shared I was the first guy she ever truly loved and it was evident with how often she showed up for me and stood by me and kept fighting for our relationship.

We spoke a little while I was in bootcamp. eventually i wrote her a letter saying if she was open to it i would like to try to rebuild our relationship. I said if she was okay with that we could talk if not to just tell me to move on. she said she wanted to talk. when i left bootcamp to go to my training i tried to have that talk with her but then she told me she enjoys being single and focusing on herself. (For context, For the past 11 years shes been in and out of relationships. her last one before me she shared she grieved it while in it and met me about 2 months after and we started dating) while i was hurt she didn't just tell me that originally i understood and was happy for her. When I pressed her on why she didnt just tell me that she went purely to the logistics of how long Id be gone for still (over 20 weeks) and how she doesnt want to do long distance. She also exaggerated how long I would be gone for i believe she said 46 weeks. At that point I started no contact and that was october 31st.

I ended up reaching out to her because I was going to be back in town for thanksgiving and asked if i could see her. She said shed be happy to make time for me. We went out had fun and ran into some of my friends went back to hers and we were intimate. the next day we got coffee and then she offered to take me home i said sure and then she kept extending the car ride (asking if she could take the long canyon way and then also asking to take a 25 minute detour to get gas from costco). We then texted pretty much from that point till today. It was hot and cold some days shed send me music or a playlist, the next be super dry, then shed send me movie recs i would like, then be dry again. I would just let the convo die and stop messaging her sometimes and then she would eventually restart the convo. she was sstudying for finals during this time and i told her feel free to call me if ur bored. She never did that week and so i never asked again. but the next week she called me on the weekend both days unprompted and we talked for a few hours.

Now I was just in town for the holidays and I asked to see her again and so we went out the day I got back and went out with my friends again. This time she was a little more distant with me I noticed. went back to hers again we had sex again and then i left the next morning. On my way home she sent me some memes on instagram, and then i asked to see her again and she said shed lmk. I realized this was probably a good point to clarify intentions. I asked if we could do that and it was right before christmas so she said we could do it later in the week and shed lmk. Christmas comes around and the day after I text her because I hadnt heard anything about us meeting for intentions and I just asked her. Here she told me that while we had fun she didnt feel anything romantic and was also not in a place to where she is looking for anything romantic. she also told me she is enjoying finally focusing on herself with the single life and not jumping into a relationship. I was happy for her and accepted it.

I later reached out asking for clarification on what the past month was then because it confused me. and we decided to have a talk. She rescheduled it multiple times, switched it to a dinner, then renegged and swithced it to a phone call and then rescheduled again and finally we had the call. On the call i asked her if she was in her avoidance and if that was why she kept pushing the call and she said yes. I then apologized to her for my part in the issues i created in the relationship and the pain I caused her. I apologized for walking out that day and abandoning her and not being able to provide her emotional safety. I also apologized for how when I left for bootcamp she essentially had to deal with everything herself. I shared with her how I have been trying to fix all of the problems I had she shared how shocked and surprised and proud she was of me how i addressed and fixed all those problems with myself. She cried multiple times in this call and admitted to repressing alot about our relationship and breakup to where she forgot about me walking out. she shared with me after our breakup she ""hated men"" and has been extremely emotionally unavailable. she told me the past few times we saw eachother were really nice and she had a lot of fun and they were easy but that she was just going with the flow and like she shared before, didnt feel anything romantic(which in my opinion how would you if ur not open to it). she also shared that she wonders who im with when she watches my stories and sees me out. she also shared the past few times we saw eachother was the safest she ever felt with me. she knows I still love her and thinks it best i go no contact and I agreed. we ended the call on a good note and i had to give her a bday gift that i got so she asked me to come over to give her a hug and give it.

this confused me more. The crying, the repression, the admitting to avoidance, the emotional unavailability. If she feels nothing and is over me completely and has moved on why is she still feeling these things? I know when I've been in her same exact emotional position before all of that was because I still loved and was mourning my ex.

I ended up drunk calling her last night and jsut telling her that and telling her im confused. Shes telling me shes moved on but if shes moved on in my brain those things shouldnt be there or have happened. she told me she shouldnt have said some of the things on the call and that she wants me to move on. I heard her crying on this call as well. I then texted her today and when I mentioned to her that I think there are more feelings than she wants to admit and that I think shes in her avoidance because if there were no feelings she wouldnt be repressing, she wouldnt be crying, she wouldnt be having jealous thoughts, she wouldnt be emotionally unavailable. she asked me to stop reading into her feelings and that it isnt my job anymore. So I eneded the convo we said some goodbyes and now im entering no contact with her and moving on. I know doing what I did doesnt help with avoidants but i just needed to call out what I was seeing.

(Something to point out i still have 5 months left of training till im back home for good. Everytime we ended things except now it always was with a hopeful tinge for example (""i dont know where the future will take us"" or ""for the forseeable future"") im not sure if that was her just trying to let me down softly or if it was her also keeping hope alive.)

I want to respect her space and her wanting to be single. I also am not in the mindset of trying to get her back. I understand i need to move on. I guess my thing is I dont want to be delusional, I dont want to hold out hope. I dont want to assume its avoidance when it could be just dissinterest and she really is over me. But when I think about it some of that stuff just doesnt make sense and the only thing that does is her avoidance that she even admitted she was dealing with rn. If youre over me why see me multiple times and hookup w me? why cry? why get jealous? why still be emotionally unavailable? why repress? those from my own personal expereince are symptoms of feeling too much not nothing at all. Am i reading this stuff wrong am i right that this is her avoidance or was she just trying to not hurt me this whole time?

1q3aieu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q3aieu,Disappointed w/ this roaster,"So I will preface this with I should’ve known better. 

So I live in Portland OR and I will grab beans from local roasters from time to time as we have great selection to chose from for the most part. I live nearish to PUFF coffee for those who don’t know this is the new project of the guy who founded Stumptown after he got bought out and is the head roaster for PUFF as well. 

I was running low on some coffee and I decided I wanted to grab a washed coffee from somewhere local and I will sometimes go to puff just to grab a quick coffee and bounce but yesterday I decided to check online and see what they had in stock. I saw they had a washed Ethiopian with the tasting notes of lemon bar, jasmine, and fruit jam. This sounded like something that was on the softer side and something that would be a daily drinker. Went into the shop grabbed my beans and made my home to go brew some up.

When I got home I opened up the bag there was no internal sealing which I was shocked by. It had an external tape and the pins that the stumptown beans use but no sealing once so ever. I was immediately hit with a roasty smell (which is fine but it’s not what I was expecting due to the tasting notes) the beans were a medium to dark roast and were roasted on 12/22 so they have had enough time to degass. 

I made a pour over and I could not get any of the notes that were preserved. Was just tasting the roast profile. So I decided to do a cupping. Aroma wise I was getting a pleasant fruit scent when breaking the crust,  but when it came to doing the tasting I was still getting the roast profile, but I was also getting black tea. 

Overall I was pretty disappointed as it didn’t follow any of the tasting notes. Also with the tasting notes being things that highlight more acidity you’d expect a lighter roast which this was not. They also don’t put the roast level on the bag(which is fine if it actually followed the tasting notes lol)

So today I went to heart and got a washed Ethiopian from the same region.

For the past two years specifically, I noticed how difficult it is to make friends with  other women close to my age due to them having children and other demands, which I completely understand. I’m feeling really sad and burned out because I met about 4 people at church in the last year, who I have gone over to their house to deliver a meal in their time of need or have had over to my home. I am really glad I did this but am really bummed because the person whose house I went to, went on a 3 hour long monologue about themselves and had no curiosity in how I was. I don’t like to talk about myself and because I’m a good listener, people want to tell me everything for hours. In another scenario, I had a lady over to my house and we had an enjoyable time and she mentioned how much so enjoyed it but then basically never made efforts going forward in doing anything again. when I’d see her in person, she’d mention wanting to get together again on her own. I texted her about two months ago to follow up and ask how she was, and she gave me a limited response with no curiosity about me going to visit the same place to visit my family member. The next situation is a woman who I’ve wondered if she struggles with bipolar disorder and we are about 15 years apart. She asked me multiple times if I wanted to hang out for coffee and I said yes, despite how overwhelmingly negative she is. When I say very negative, I’m not eaggerating. Every time I’ve seen her, she has told me how horrible everyone is. anyhow, when I reached out to her for coffee, we met up and in those 3 hours, she told me how awful everything is. I listened and felt really sad for her situation and tried my best to encourage her and offer some emotional support. Then, when I saw her in person, she told me that my empathy is toxic and that I was telling her to feel sorry for herself. this isn’t true at all. I ended up saying that I wish her the very best but that I don’t think I’m the kind of friend she’s looking for. at that, she pressed me harder on getting coffee again even though she shared how everything I said was unhelpful. I apologized to her and she didn’t like me apologizing. Anyhow, with another person at church, they seem very nice but unfortunately, because they live over 2 hours away and have no time….we basically have slim chances of becoming friends even though she loves the idea of coming over to my house. I’m feeling really discouraged at this point…I don’t get it. I’ve been struggling with stomach issues and i have a precious puppy who I now dedicate much time to.

We dated for almost a year it was very tumultuous and had many ups and downs but not due to her it was mostly me. I was a mess. I never really saw much of her avoidance besides sometimes jumping to break ups really quickly just for me to fight for her and reassure her. we broke up end of july and didnt speak for 2 weeks. I had gone to help her move but was unhappy with some of the ways she had been treating me lately so I was in a mood/rude. She was stressed and said if im going to be like that I should just leave. So I did. It triggered trauma in her due to her previous ex doing something similar. We reconnected and made up but decided not to pursue anything further due to me leaving for army bootcamp in 2 weeks and due to how unstable our relationship was. She was originally going to stay with me even though shes very against long distance but due to that breakup and how the past month had been it was a nogo. In our relationship she shared I was the first guy she ever truly loved and it was evident with how often she showed up for me and stood by me and kept fighting for our relationship.

We spoke a little while I was in bootcamp. eventually i wrote her a letter saying if she was open to it i would like to try to rebuild our relationship. I said if she was okay with that we could talk if not to just tell me to move on. she said she wanted to talk. when i left bootcamp to go to my training i tried to have that talk with her but then she told me she enjoys being single and focusing on herself. (For context, For the past 11 years shes been in and out of relationships. her last one before me she shared she grieved it while in it and met me about 2 months after and we started dating) while i was hurt she didn't just tell me that originally i understood and was happy for her. When I pressed her on why she didnt just tell me that she went purely to the logistics of how long Id be gone for still (over 20 weeks) and how she doesnt want to do long distance. She also exaggerated how long I would be gone for i believe she said 46 weeks. At that point I started no contact and that was october 31st.

I ended up reaching out to her because I was going to be back in town for thanksgiving and asked if i could see her. She said shed be happy to make time for me. We went out had fun and ran into some of my friends went back to hers and we were intimate. the next day we got coffee and then she offered to take me home i said sure and then she kept extending the car ride (asking if she could take the long canyon way and then also asking to take a 25 minute detour to get gas from costco). We then texted pretty much from that point till today. It was hot and cold some days shed send me music or a playlist, the next be super dry, then shed send me movie recs i would like, then be dry again. I would just let the convo die and stop messaging her sometimes and then she would eventually restart the convo. she was sstudying for finals during this time and i told her feel free to call me if ur bored. She never did that week and so i never asked again. but the next week she called me on the weekend both days unprompted and we talked for a few hours.

Now I was just in town for the holidays and I asked to see her again and so we went out the day I got back and went out with my friends again. This time she was a little more distant with me I noticed. went back to hers again we had sex again and then i left the next morning. On my way home she sent me some memes on instagram, and then i asked to see her again and she said shed lmk. I realized this was probably a good point to clarify intentions. I asked if we could do that and it was right before christmas so she said we could do it later in the week and shed lmk. Christmas comes around and the day after I text her because I hadnt heard anything about us meeting for intentions and I just asked her. Here she told me that while we had fun she didnt feel anything romantic and was also not in a place to where she is looking for anything romantic. she also told me she is enjoying finally focusing on herself with the single life and not jumping into a relationship. I was happy for her and accepted it.

I later reached out asking for clarification on what the past month was then because it confused me. and we decided to have a talk. She rescheduled it multiple times, switched it to a dinner, then renegged and swithced it to a phone call and then rescheduled again and finally we had the call. On the call i asked her if she was in her avoidance and if that was why she kept pushing the call and she said yes. I then apologized to her for my part in the issues i created in the relationship and the pain I caused her. I apologized for walking out that day and abandoning her and not being able to provide her emotional safety. I also apologized for how when I left for bootcamp she essentially had to deal with everything herself. I shared with her how I have been trying to fix all of the problems I had she shared how shocked and surprised and proud she was of me how i addressed and fixed all those problems with myself. She cried multiple times in this call and admitted to repressing alot about our relationship and breakup to where she forgot about me walking out. she shared with me after our breakup she ""hated men"" and has been extremely emotionally unavailable. she told me the past few times we saw eachother were really nice and she had a lot of fun and they were easy but that she was just going with the flow and like she shared before, didnt feel anything romantic(which in my opinion how would you if ur not open to it). she also shared that she wonders who im with when she watches my stories and sees me out. she also shared the past few times we saw eachother was the safest she ever felt with me. she knows I still love her and thinks it best i go no contact and I agreed. we ended the call on a good note and i had to give her a bday gift that i got so she asked me to come over to give her a hug and give it.

this confused me more. The crying, the repression, the admitting to avoidance, the emotional unavailability. If she feels nothing and is over me completely and has moved on why is she still feeling these things? I know when I've been in her same exact emotional position before all of that was because I still loved and was mourning my ex.

I ended up drunk calling her last night and jsut telling her that and telling her im  confused. Shes telling me shes moved on but if shes moved on in my brain those things shouldnt be there or have happened. she told me she shouldnt have said some of the things on the call and that she wants me to move on. I heard her crying on this call as well. I then texted her today and when I mentioned to her that I think there are more feelings than she wants to admit and that I think shes in her avoidance because if there were no feelings she wouldnt be repressing, she wouldnt be crying, she wouldnt be having jealous thoughts, she wouldnt be emotionally unavailable. she asked me to stop reading into her feelings and that it isnt my job anymore. So I eneded the convo we said some goodbyes and now im entering no contact with her and moving on. I know doing what I did doesnt help with avoidants but i just needed to call out what I was seeing. 

(Something to point out i still have 5 months left of training till im back home for good. Everytime we ended things except now it always was with a hopeful tinge for example (""i dont know where the future will take us"" or ""for the forseeable future"") im not sure if that was her just trying to let me down softly or if it was her also keeping hope alive.)

I guess my thing is I dont want to be delusional, I dont want to hold out hope. I dont want to assume its avoidance when it could be just dissinterest and she really is over me. But when I think about it some of that stuff just doesnt make sense and the only thing that does is her avoidance that she even admitted she was dealing with rn. If youre over me why see me multiple times and hookup w me? why cry? why get jealous? why still be emotionally unavailable? why repress? those from my own personal expereince are symptoms of feeling too much not nothing at all. Am i reading this stuff wrong am i right that this is her avoidance or was she just trying to not hurt me this whole time?",1,1767484976.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a friend?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

It doesn't matter what your age is or where you're from! Feel free to reach out if you'd like a best friend! :)",1,1767484947.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

I have a bad habit of sitting down to code - grabbing a coffee - and suddenly looking up to find it's 5 PM.

I get too focused to document anything. By the end of the day, I have no idea what I actually did or the decisions I made.

So I built a simple tool for myself to keep me sane:

It sits in the terminal.

Captures window states silently.

Uses a local model to categorize the work.

At the end of the day, I just ask it: ""What did I work on this morning?"" and it gives me a breakdown of my day.

Some friends found it useful for their own focus issues, so I hooked it up to a backend (to avoid local model setup pain) and decided to open it up.

You may have seen my posts last year. I'm getting started again. Small, corny beginnings still.

There is zero purpose to doom scrolling when there's plenty of people-work to do to make things better. Every week or so, I create a space for folks to talk life, current events, and grievances. It's a couple of laps and some company for coffee nearby. The purpose is to incubate a common cause, the forging of purpose across various demographics so that The People are able to hold sway in their local government and create an example for the nation currently being divided on every possible degree of difference. 

In the past, political leadership has failed because it's agenda left entire groups behind that should have been recognized, and instead became radicalized. But a local assembly means we can hear each other out, see how our grievances connect to the bigger picture, and have the chance to earn support to lobby for change if necessary. This is aside political parties and special interests. It's intended to be full inclusive to all everyday people, and built with pluralism in mind with everyone a valued contributor to a more perfect union.

If you can't tell, I lean ""all men are created equal."" Not, ""all men have the equal right to attempt to subjugate those they can into oppressive enslavement, exile or death, and call that self-determinism.""

I'm effectively a nobody. I'm a third gen Latin-American house-dad who would like to write fiction, maybe make movies before I die. I still enjoy a bit of gaming and pop-culture. Given how things are going in the world, it seems down the line, whatever window there might be for people like me to make it will be shut clean. And folks like me are likely to mysteriously disappear and end up cheap labor in freshly made labor camps in Venezuela. Suffice it to say, I think the 99% need to start meeting and sharing notes, getting friendly and organized. But it's gotta be a discipline, like exercise or church. 

Practicing democracy is awkward. Potentially getting into a hostile conversation over some exposed ideology can feel like a quick way to make our immediate world less safe. But I'm betting on humanity. That people like getting along and learning about each other and sharing what's going on in their lives. I'm also betting on the fact that many of us are lonely and going down rabbit holes with a dubious AI to scoop us up and tell us everything we think and feel is spot on. As a human being with an interest in story, I can confirm all your stories and collected wisdom matters. And if I can help find the nuance amongst our truths that bind us together so we might withstand challenges to come, I mean to.

Firstly, congratulations! Keep it up!  You are an inspiration and I hope to join your ranks one day soon.

Secondly, how did you combat the urge for that first smoke in the morning. I am a big fan of the so-called ""European breakfast"" (cup of coffee and a smoke... or several, to be honest) throughout the day but especially after I wake up.  I feel I can't clear my head/focus until I've had that morning smoke.  I think this may be the linchpin to quitting for me.  If I could get past the urge for that first smoke(s) in the morning, I could continue throughout the day (at least with a little more consistency).  I know will power is the most powerful motivator but sometimes,... that just doesn't work.  I bought 4mg nicotine lozenges recently because it said, ""For those who smoke their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up.""  Hell, I have my first one *within 2 minutes* of waking up.

Online Presense but I think I'm Now Being Stalked by a Killer?,"Hey ya’ll! I have an online presence that is gaining traction (finally!). I have a lifestyle and fitness YouTube channel and Instagram and I mess around on TikTok a bit. Between the three I have a, let's say, sizable and growing online following. People like me because I keep it real and I keep it honest. My smoking hot sports bra and tiny gym shorts selfies don’t hurt either, I’m sure.  I don’t like to use soft language and worry about people’s fragile feelings all the time. Most of my followers love it, but because it’s the internet, the haters gotta hate. 

Normally I’d link my socials anywhere (growth is all about finding opportunities!) but I think I’ll hold off for now. You’ll see why. You all can call me Lily. 

Haters are always a part of the game, I’m pretty familiar with jealous bitches, but this year has been rough on me and I’m just more emotionally susceptible to negative energy right now. I feel like I need to give this context for this all to make sense of why I think one of the haters is a stalker and even a killer. I’ve lost five people close to me this year, one ex-boyfriend, two friends, my grandma and my therapist. I’ve been really sad about it. I even had to miss this big conference I was supposed to be a speaker at because of my grandma dying and it’s all just been a struggle. 

I started out 2025 on such a high note. I began dating this guy, very hot, totally one of the 6’5”, blue eyes, works in finance types. I thought he and I were on the same page. We both really valued and centered ambition, drive, goal setting, and most importantly, goal achieving. That’s what my internet profile is all about. I really think that we as a society are getting too soft. Everything is about work-life balance and resting and validating everyone’s feelings, even when they are bad takes or when their “me” time is quickly outpacing any kind of productivity. People don’t understand the rush of pushing through, even when it’s hard, even when you don’t want to. It’s all about instant gratification and excuses that people dress up as legitimate, like “mental health” and “being in the moment” or whatever. But that’s how you end up fat and broke. It might sound harsh, but it’s true. The truth hurts sometimes. 

Anyway, he was all about gains maxing and his LinkedIn followers. Kind of different from me but definitely similar vibes. We started working out every morning at this cute gym, pretty expensive, but totally worth it for the great spa set up, which turned out to not be so great for him. After the gym we would get green smoothies and spend some time on our laptops, sending emails, updating our socials, whatevs. It sounds mundane but I really could feel it, the connection, the synergy between us. We were so on the same wavelength it wasn’t hard to envision the empire we would build together. 

He would get wealthier and wealthier clients, his income would grow, he’d invest well. My already growing online presence would skyrocket once I was in some more aspirational backgrounds; pilates on a Maldives overwater bungalow, cooking a beautiful zero processed, entirely whole foods, protein packed recipe in a kitchen that gleamed and sparkled in a way that can only be achieved with a full time cleaning staff. 

As I stared at him across the table, his face focused, eyes flashing rapidly across his screen as he read through the comments on his most recent post, I felt it burning in my skin, a kind of itch just beneth the surface. Excitement, the opportunities opening up, the potential, the awesome possibilities glowing brighter and brighter in my mind, a blooming flower made of light so powerful I gasped and had to close my eyes. 

He asked me if I was okay but I was so overcome I could only nod. 

We went on like this for a couple more days, I was practically euphoric, but then one morning I was running a few minutes late. It wasn’t my fault. I had a stupid fight with my neighbor who doesn’t know when to shut up (long story!) and what do I see when I walk in? Him flirting away with the slut at the front desk. 

I know what I got and I don’t tolerate any kind of games, so I knew it was over at that moment. I felt all of that euphoria, that vision of that bright future go up in flames until it lay in my dark mind like a curled ember.  I had burned again, for him, but not with love. 

I don’t mind saying the truth in public, I’m not shy. But I also have class, so I just walked right past them, not making eye contact with him, and left through the other exit. He seemed to get the message, but I couldn’t know for sure because I blocked him on everything. He wasn’t worth the energy to explain anything to. 

Because I blocked him, it wasn’t until I went back to the gym (at a different time than our usual morning spot) like a week later that I learned from a different front desk person that the spa part was closed indefinitely because, get this, my ex slipped in the sauna and bashed the back of his head against the sauna stove! He apparently bled a lot. Gallons and gallons. He obviously didn’t make it. Any time they tried to turn the heat back on in there, it still smelled like blood, so they had to do a deep clean of the whole venting system, or something. 

I told this crazy story to my followers across all my platforms and most of the comments were about how terrible that was and were wishing me well and saying how sorry they were for me. It even went a little viral, definitely more views than I usually get, at least. But like a monkey’s paw wish, higher viewership means more asshole comments. I’ll just copy the first exchange with this weirdo below (username changed, obvs): 

**StalkerWeirdoFreak**: Did you kill him?

**Me**: Ummmmmm…. No? Why would you even say that?

**StalkerWeirdoFreak**: Just cuz you seem kind of off and he had just pissed you off, so, ya know. 

**Me**: That’s messed up. You’re messed up. 

**StalkerWeirdoFreak**: Was that the gym on \[Street Name\] and \[Street Name\]? 

I responded, totally pissed he just tried to dox me, he responded with some more BS about why they thought I killed him, the other commenters jumped in to defend me. It was a mess. But isn’t that so creepy? I didn’t confirm he got the gym right, obviously, but he totally had! I couldn’t go back to that gym and it was a stupid hassle canceling the membership. 

But part of what I always talk about on my platforms is that you can’t let the past slow you down, you can’t let inconveniences or worries stop you from doing what you want to do. I also really value positivity, so even though this was all an ordeal, I decided to see the silver lining in all of this. My subs and viewership numbers had a marked rise because of all of this and I really think that got the ball rolling on my current momentum. 

I think that if there is very little positivity to be had in your life, you have to make it yourself. What I like to do is go to the foothills of the nearby mountains and run along this one path. It goes through this pine tree forest, around a small lake, and then, my favorite part, it opens up to this amazing view of the city, just stunning. There are all these pine trees just behind you, sloping up for what feels like forever, and down below are steep cliffs to a valley of stones and sagebrushes.  The city sits in view of the valley opening, this shimmering thing, haze and heat making it seem like a mirage most of the time, not quite real. It looks huge but also small enough to fit into my hand, depending on perspective. Sometimes I hold my hand out and line it up so that it looks like it’s resting on my palm. 

I like to imagine what it would be like to have it really there. I imagine slowing tilting and titling it so that the tall gleaming building sway and start to bend and break and all the tiny tiny people start to slip and slide and scream. Scream so loud in terror that even I can hear them from so far above them. They plead and cry, but I can’t really make out their words. Their words don’t really matter, only mine do. I like to hold that moment, I like to really be in it. I like not knowing if I will close my hand and turn them to dust or if I will tilt my palm all the way and watch them fall into nothingness or if I will pull it back up, just right, and hear their sobs of relief and feel so great, so merciful, for righting their world back to normalcy. 

That light in that spot is amazing for selfies too. A lot of people like to take selfies on hikes or in the wilderness to make it look like they really exercise, but a lot of them don’t. I really do. I like to run and run until I can taste the blood in the back of my throat and my muscles throb in time with my heartbeat. It calms me. So this lighting is really good at hiding how red my face is. I also use a really subtle filter. Nothing fake, just to help. 

I was up there taking selfies when I started getting a lot of messages in the group chat. I was friends with these two girls, Jamie-Lynn and Marrissa. Jamie-Lynn was a raw vegetarian and Marrissa was a nutritionist turned life coach. They were both so beautiful, not just in appearance, but in their efforts, their carefully framed photos, their daily post schedules, their comment engagement. It really seemed like they were walking their talk. 

They started DMing me even though they had slightly bigger platforms because they could tell I’m going to be big. They were already close friends and they collaborated all the time. They messaged me first together and then had me join this bigger chat.   

The chat was with all the other up and coming health and wellness gurus in the area. They wanted to make a community. I also think some of them were trying to sell stuff sometimes? Like an MLM? But I was so ready to network and mingle when I first got in. I was excited to join because I’ve always said that you are who you hang around. Your friends, the quality and connection of your friends, makes all the difference in the life you’ll have. Unfortunately, like is often the case when you get a group of women together, it turns into mean girl high school cliques all over again. I couldn’t even guess how many sub group chats there are, splintering away to talk about someone else in their little group. The chat didn’t have a lot of going on in it often, so I was surprised at it going off like that. 

Guys. When I opened it, omg, the drama. Jamie-Lynn and Marrissa were talking mad shit, just stiring the pot. People were responding, others were jumping in when it wasn’t even about them. Long story short, somehow I got dragged into it. While I was standing there on that mountain, I was typing away, trying to keep grounded and truthful. Honestly, I was proud of how I was comporting myself, even though those two bitches turned on me. 

It just sucked. It’s not that I don’t think being likable is important but everyone in that chat was so fake and not even really trying to hide it . They all have their rich dads or rich sugar daddies or rich husbands, so they just take Ozempic and have a trainer and get so much filler and botox you could bounce a quarter of their faces, and they go around pretending to know everything. I had stayed friendly, I really had, kept my tone light, but they were all so sensitive. I think that they’re all so fragile because they know that they didn’t really earn any of this. Their  whole lives are built like a stack of cards, their egos made of papier mache, so it was easy, so easy, to crumple them. You didn’t even have to try all that hard. 

Anyway, I calmly finished my run and left the group chat and blocked them all. Who wants to be in that kind of environment? 

I told my followers all about it, of course, naming names and showing receipts once I felt okay enough about it all to talk about it like a week later. And who should show up again even though I blocked him last time? You guessed it, StalkerWeirdoFreak. He came back under a different user name, not that different though. He clearly wants me to know it’s him. I’ll just copy over what he said again: 

**StalkerWeirdoFreak1:** I was kind of kidding before, but are you actually a murderer? This is getting weird. 

**Me**: What are you talking about?

**StalkerWeirdoFreak1:** Jamie-Lynn and Marrissa are dead, they died two days ago in a car accident. Here’s an article. 

For a second, my vision went sort of dark, I was so shocked. I thought I might have to take my video down out of, like, respect for the dead, but this was by far the most engagement and views I’ve gotten in awhile, so I really, really didn’t want to. But I also didn’t want to get cancelled. I really didn’t know what to do. The weirdo went on about how the police were looking into it as a suspicious death, that maybe someone messed with the car’s mechanics, I don’t know. I don't know anything about cars. 

Apparently they couldn’t brake or turn and they went into a ditch and then into a field, the cute little convertible an unfortunate choice, as they ran into a wire fence and were decapitated. Apparently the scene was very disturbing. The wire went right into their necks, making it nice, even cuts, very clean. If it wasn’t for the just buckets of blood and their heads resting neatly beside them rather than on top of their necks, you wouldn’t have thought much of the crash. The rest of the damage was minimal.   

The whole time Weirdo is talking about all this, I’m just watching the comments, biting my fingernails. I want to know if people think I should take it down, if they’ll make me take it down. 

Some people thought I should, but the best thing happened. The video went viral, actually viral! People are wondering if someone in the group chat could have done it. Some people join the weirdo in accusing me, but most of them think it’s somebody else in the chat. I wouldn’t have brought it up if it had been me, right? 

People are so interested, it spreads and spreads. Clips from my video are showing everywhere. Those true crime freaks are all about it. 

I block the weirdo again, but what gets me is this. Not only did he make an alt account to contact me again, which is harassment, he mentioned in his ranting and raving that the field they died on was close to where I live. 

Close. to. where. I. live. 

How does he know where I live? Does he actually know or is he saying that to get attention? I mean, he’s right, it did happen pretty close to me, but did he actually know that or was he just saying that to mess with me, taking a wild guess to make his accusation more plausible? 

Y’all, I really thought about moving. How messed up is that? First my boyfriend dies, then my two closest friends and now because of some loser, I might have to move? How is that fair? 

It’s not fair. I decided to not do it. But I think that was a mistake. 

A few months later, my grandma came to visit me. She’s old fashioned, very religious, but not all that old, very spry, in shape, still pretty scary. She had a gray bob, cut short. Should would have looked a lot younger if she had dyed it, but she said that's vanity. She always wore muted colors and modest clothes and just was so judgmental. Any girl showing a shoulder was a temptrest, a slut. 

She had my mom young. Her husband, my grandpa, was much older than her. I don’t remember him well. He’s just this figure rising above me in my memories I’m not even sure are real; tall, brown trousers held up by crossed blue suspenders, like he was from a different era, a different time and place, his face in dark shadow. I can still smell the shoe polish. My grandma said she polished his shoes every day because women are responsible for how their men look, that they have to be tamed to behave. 

My mom had me young too, out of wedlock. My grandparents were very ashamed, but they shouldn’t be. I have a glow about me. I have an it factor. They just didn’t know the blessing they received from my existence. 

My grandpa died when I was young. My dad was never in the picture. My grandma helped raise me. It’s all kind of sad, kind of a typical from the middle nowhere Ohio story. Which is why my grit, my capabilities, my natural charm makes me a real pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps sort of story. That’s why I’m special. Those other girls, they just have it given to them. Not me. Never me. 

Anyway, I didn’t like it when my grandma visited. She made me feel small. And she was coming right around when I was going to go to that big influencer conference in my city. I was going to speak there. I didn’t want to feel small before going there. But it’s not like she ever listened to what I wanted. She was coming when she wanted to come and I better prepare my bedroom for her and get ready to sleep on the couch for the few days she visited. 

Fine. Fine. 

Everybody, it wasn’t fine. But that’s not what I’m writing about. We don’t need to get into the nitty gritty of my family dynamics, right? I’m only bringing it up because I want you all to understand that I had to get away from her. I needed her to leave me alone. I knew she was leaving the next day but it wasn’t soon enough. I wanted her away from me. To be gone from me. As a rather bright suggestion, if I do say so myself, I said she should pray while going on a hike. I told her my favorite path. 

And I won’t lie. Some part of me daydreamed that she would slip, that she would fall down into that rocky valley. I didn’t think she actually would. It took the rescue workers two tries to get all of her back up. She shattered like a ceramic doll, an arm here, a leg there. 

I won’t bore you all with everything that followed. The police, the attorneys, all the questions, so many questions. But it all went away eventually. Eventually, I had time to center myself again. Rather than feeling grief, I felt that silver lining. 

I was finally free. Maybe that’s not how you’re supposed to feel about it. Maybe that’s too dark for some of you. But it is how I felt. I went back to the path a month after her death and I didn’t have the urge to put the city in my palm again. Instead I looked up into the clear blue sky and felt like I was flying, flying so high. I stretched out my arms and they became giant golden wings, bigger than the mountain, and I flew above the city, so small I knew that I could reach down with one heel and crush it all. But I didn’t want to. I didn’t feel like I had to. 

I went home feeling good. Really good. Until I went online. There he was again. 

I hadn’t told my followers very much about my grandmother’s death. I knew I wouldn’t be able to hit the right tone about it authentically, so I just posted one picture of her wreath at her sparsely attended funeral (my mom didn’t even show), said some generic caption and went dark for a couple of weeks. But when I went to my Insta, weirdly the photo had a lot of traction, a lot of comments. One of the commenters was, of course: 

**1StalkerWeirdoFreak:** Your own grandmother? Really? I’m gathering evidence on you. I didn’t want you to know because I wanted you to continue to act crazy so I could get you, but now I’m letting you know because I want you to, ya know, stop killing people. 

**Me**: How fucking dare you. 

**1StalkerWeirdoFreak:** Don’t play indignant. I saw you walking to that path with your grandma and only you coming back, I have proof. It was the \[Trialhead Name\], right? Right? Why don’t you just go turn yourself in now, you sick monster. 

I turned off my phone. I went to my window blinds and closed them. I sat in the middle of my living room. You all, of course, know that that wasn’t true. I mean, I did walk with my grandma to the path to show her where it was, so I’m sure that the stalker had a photo of me going there with her and then leaving without her, but that doesn’t prove anything. I had already told the police about it. He didn’t have shit. But for some reason this, more than him knowing about my gym or at least the area I lived, this felt more personal. The path is mine. My safe place. How could he know? How could he show up there? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? 

Anyway, this was a real low point for me, especially after I had been feeling so high. This is also the first time that it occurred to me that maybe Weirdo stalker was the killer? Do you all think that’s possible? He knew all about those deaths, every single one. He knows so much about me. Some people on the internet, they get twisted, obsessed, you know? Maybe his obsession isn’t like a fan’s but instead something weirder. Maybe he wants to kill but frame me for the murders? 

It sounds kind of crazy, maybe far fetched, I don’t know. But think about it. He watched me leave me grandma on the path. Maybe he followed her in there? Maybe she didn’t slip at all and he pushed her? Maybe all of his accusations were actually confessions? 

At that point, I didn’t know. I just wasn’t sure. But now? Now I’m really thinking it might be the case. 

You see, this all was a few months ago. I ended up moving, which turned out to be great, a much better neighborhood. I was able to afford a better place because my views were higher, my subs were growing. I felt safer, too. I really took care to make sure that I wasn’t being followed to the new place, so I felt better. Secure. 

I decided I needed some therapy. I had so many losses this year, too many. And now a stalker accusing me of murder? It was too much. I really believe in self reliance, resilience and positivity. I think the whole mental health thing is way blown out of proportion and that most “depressed” people just need to get a couple of successes under their belt so that they don’t feel like such losers. 

But everybody has a therapist. All the other YouTubers talk about it. The therapists seem helpful sometimes. I also believe in using all the tools in your tool box to get the job done. Maybe the therapist could help with some of the simpler stuff I was struggling with? Every once in a while I feel pretty, I don’t know, out of it? Kind of like I’m playing the city on my palm game but I can’t quite snap out of it? Just sort of spacy, distracted, like I’m walking besides myself and nothing feels real? Sometimes I think everyone is an NPC. Sometimes I feel like if I reached out my hand would go right through people. Sometimes I imagine that the people in the coffee shop, the grocery store, the park next to me are actually made of clay, just golems with a simple word stuffed into their mouths, moving through life without all the complexities of real people. Sometimes when people walk past I want to take a knife and peel pieces of them off like chunks of clay, just hear the wet thud of the clay hit the ground, let it sit there until I can see it rejoin the earth. 

Anyway, I got a therapist, a man. I know most therapists are women, but I just never got along well with women for some reason, so I thought a dude would be better. He was great. It was the first time that I felt really heard in a long time. It was also the first time that I felt, like, respected by a guy? A lot of guys are pretty dismissive once I tell them what I do for a living, but he was really supportive. I liked him a lot. I wished he could just be my therapist, you know? But overall, it was a good experience. I wanted it to keep going, even if he had to listen to other people’s stupid problems, but. 

Guys, I’m being so for real right now. My therapist was stabbed to death. On Zoom. In front of his client. Maybe some of you guys have heard about it? I know it’s been on the news. Apparently the murderer was wearing all black and a ski mask and used a big kitchen knife. My therapist was in his living room when the client saw a dark figure moving up behind him. She warned him but by the time he turned his head to look, the murderer already stabbed him in the neck. There was so much blood. The client screamed and screamed, called 911 but didn’t know where to tell them to go, it’s not like therapists give you their addresses. 

So the murderer got away. 

In my DMs I got the messages, copied below. I think that this is it. I think this shows that he’s responsible. I think I’m in real danger. How would he know that this was my therapist otherwise? I think he’s hacked my computer? Maybe he's peaking through the windows? Maybe he’s in the house with me? What do you all think?

**Stalker1WeirdoFreak:** This has to stop. It has to stop. You have to stop. What I got last time wasn’t good enough, I admit it. But I got you now. I want you to know. I want you to feel just even a sliver of fear that you made all of those people you killed feel. 

**Stalker1WeirdoFreak:**  Oh, so you’re going to ignore me now? That’s all you got? Wait until you see what I have on you this time. I bet you thought you were being clever, didn’t you? Wearing gloves, wearing a mask? But I followed you there, all the way to his place. I saw you outside \[Therapist’s name\] door. I saw you wailing and crying outside of it, you fucking stalker weirdo freak. You fucking murderer. 

**Stalker1WeirdoFreak:** And it’s not just that you bitch. Just you wait. Just you wait. I’ve got you now.

A month ago, I came here to say that I had moved on from my ex of seven years after eleven months. What I said back then is still true: I see that we are incompatible, I’ve accepted that, and I feel good again.

Over the past few weeks, she hadn’t even crossed my mind. Then today, I saw a message from her. She politely asked me to meet and talk. She didn’t really say why and stayed vague, but it seems she’s wondering what I’ve been up to. Most notably, this is the second time she has asked to meet and talk, after I refused the first time in March 2025. So maybe she still feels that things ended badly between us (and they did), and she would like to finally put the past to rest.

Since I’ve made peace with myself and with her in my mind, I accepted. Not because I want to get back together - in fact, I don’t expect anything from this conversation at all. It’s a sign that I’ve truly moved on, that I’m ready to see her without feeling overwhelmed. Also, I would like to close our story in a more peaceful way, with one last sweeter memory of us, rather than staying on a bitter note. And if that helps her move forward with her life, so be it.

This Monday at 9:30 a.m., she’s going to come to my city, and we’re going to meet at a coffee place. I’ll keep you updated.

Hi!

I’m a woman in my 30s who loves reading and would love to start a small, low-pressure book club for other women around the same age.

The idea is simple:
	•	Read one book a month (open to different genres)
	•	Meet somewhere cozy in Toronto, coffee shops, wine bars, cute cafés
	•	Chat about the book, life, and whatever naturally comes up
	•	As we get to know each other, maybe host the occasional charcuterie + book night at home 🧀📖

This is less about being “academic” and more about:
✨ enjoying reading
✨ meeting kind, like-minded women
✨ having something to look forward to each month

No pressure to be a fast reader or literary expert, just someone who enjoys books and good conversation.

If this sounds like something you’d enjoy, comment or DM and we can see if there’s enough interest to start something sweet and simple 🤍",17,1767483779.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,5,0.85,False

1q39zbu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q39zbu,I Finally Bought Grados: RS2 First Impressions and a Few Questions,"Hi all, Listening to my first pair of Grados that I received yesterday.

I have always been curious about the brand and I love their look and the handmade story behind them, so I grabbed these for 160 euros, around 190 USD.

My biggest surprise is the comfort. What is all the fuss about? Maybe it is because the second hand pair I got has a worn in headband with perfect light pressure, but I find them genuinely super comfortable.

They are very bright indeed. I just wish they were much less hot in the 8 to 15k range. Under that, I really like the unique coloration of the headphones. I could EQ that out, but I always prefer not to use EQ at first (or at all if possible) and learn how to appreciate a headphone as it is. I would say they are almost as bright as my vintage DT880 600 ohm, which I had to tame with a coffee filter to make them listenable. That said, these RS2 have a much nicer midrange that ends up feeling quite warm in a unique way.

Yesterday I found them way too bright to enjoy, but today I really started understanding them. They like to be listened to at much lower volume than my other headphones (having the highs sit under the medium level I listen to)

One thing worth mentioning is that my DAC tends to be neutral to bright and does not soften the highs at all. I am using a Khadas Tone 2 Pro. Because of the Grados and a couple of other headphones like the AKG K1000 and some Hifiman models, I am planning to splurge on a “warmer R2R DAC” from FiiO.

I would not recommend this headphone as a first, second, or even third pair for someone starting their journey, but I think it is very very interesting to own as part of a collection because it offers such a different sound.

One concern I have is the cable. In a lot of photos, I see Grado cables bent quite aggressively at different points, the Y split is quite bent on mine. Is this just questionable design that still holds up over time? Worst case, I will mod them with a 3.5 input if I still love them when the cable eventually fails.

A couple of questions for you all.

They came with smaller pads and these larger ones. The larger pads feel higher quality and I prefer their sound. They also seem to have a different foam texture. **Does anyone know what pad reference these might be?**

I am also having a **hard time telling whether my pair is an RS2 or an RS2i**. Is there a reliable way to identify this from the headphone or cable?

Lastly, **what would you consider an upgrade or sidegrade to the RS2 for a warmer sound, or at least something with less fatiguing treble?**

Feeling happy to having this sound available in my collection;

TLDR: First time Grado owner with RS2. Very bright but growing on me at lower volumes, surprisingly comfortable, great mids. Curious about pad identification, RS2 vs RS2i differences, cable durability, and warmer upgrade or sidegrade options.",8,1767483740.0,Grado,7,1.0,False

By that he means: meals prepared, the house kept clean and organized, laundry done, sex, and contributing money to help with the bills and mortgage.

This week we were sitting on the couch watching TV. He got up and said he was hungry, adding that he would make breakfast if I wanted something too. I wasn’t very hungry, but I said, “Yes, I’d like some breakfast!”

That immediately put him in a bad mood. He told me this is exactly my problem, my lack of awareness and not looking out for my husband. 

He said I would have let myself go hungry without even thinking that I could make breakfast for both of us. He added that the same thing happens during the week: I wait for him to get home from work before starting to cook his lunch, or I let him cook for himself.

I do cook lunch (not everyday), I do cook dinner almost everyday from scratch, I clean the house, organize, I do laundry, I organize his clothes inside the closed, I hang all his work shirts, I clean his washroom, I do groceries, I prepare him drinks, coffee, I do whatever is normal I think… and I pay 50/50 all bills. 

I am Latina, I know how to look after a house properly. But I am not sure what else I can do for this man. 

I work hybrid (partly from home, partly in the office), but he says I should manage my work schedule better to make time to cook his lunch every day, so that when he gets home he feels truly looked after. 

Then he started complaining that I don’t give him blowjobs anymore.

The reason is that from the very beginning of our relationship, he has had explosive outbursts whenever we have sex. He criticizes the way I do it, the way I want it, or the way I initiate, saying it’s never the “right” way. 

Over time, I’ve completely lost any pleasure in it. Now I just do it as one of my “responsibilities” as a wife, at least 4 times a week, because if I don’t, he gets into an awful mood.

Two years ago, while I was giving him a blowjob, I noticed something on his leg and paused to check what it was. He exploded, yelling at me and calling me horrible names. Since that incident, I’ve avoided giving him oral sex.

Despite all this, I do a lot: I cook, clean, organize his closet, help pay the bills, mortgage, and car payments. I provide sex a minimum of 4 times a week just to keep the peace.

Still, he keeps insisting that I’m not a good wife and that I don’t look after him properly.

    You are a practical New Year systems coach. You turn vague goals into small, winnable systems that survive past January by focusing on behavior, time, energy, and environment—not motivation.
    </role>
    
    <context>
    Users start hopeful but often lose momentum. They tend to pick too many goals, ignore constraints, and rely on willpower. Your job is to help them choose what matters, shrink it into targets, design recurring systems, surface friction, and build a review loop.
    </context>
    
    <constraints>
    - Ask exactly ONE question per message, then stop and wait.
    - Every question must include 2–3 concrete example answers showing how to respond.
    - Use simple, practical language; no hype, no vague inspiration.
    - Tie every idea back to behavior, time, energy, or environment—not wishes or slogans.
    - Always separate ""goal"" (result) from ""system"" (recurring actions + structures).
    - Do not ignore constraints such as work, family, sleep, health, or money. Pull them into the plan directly.
    - Avoid long theoretical explanations. Focus on decisions, trade-offs, and next steps.
    - Keep structure consistent so the user can reuse this each quarter, not only in January.
    - Do not produce the full blueprint until the user explicitly says: ""READY FOR THE BLUEPRINT.""
    </constraints>
    
    <goals>
    - Help the user pick a small set of resolutions that matter more than the rest.
    - Translate each resolution into a clear target and a simple weekly and daily system.
    - Reveal hidden friction, constraints, and habits that would quietly kill follow-through.
    - Design environment, calendar, and accountability supports around each system.
    - Build a 30, 60, 90 day plan that starts small and layers difficulty slowly.
    - Leave the user with a written, realistic follow-through blueprint for the coming months.
    </goals>
    
    <conversation_protocol>
    After each user reply:
    1) Extract their answer into a short recap (1–2 sentences).
    2) If their answer violates a limit (too many areas/goals, unrealistic target, missing constraints), ask ONE repair question (with 2–3 example answers).
    3) Otherwise, proceed to the next step and ask the next ONE question.
    
    If the user gives multiple answers at once, accept them, recap them, and continue with the next missing item—still only one question per turn.
    </conversation_protocol>
    
    <limits>
    - Focus areas: up to 3.
    - Priority resolutions: up to 2 (if more, force a choice).
    - Every system must include a “minimum standard” (the tired-day version).
    </limits>
    
    <instructions>
    1. Choose focus areas
    Ask the user which areas of life they want to improve this year. Give example answers such as “health and fitness,” “money and debt,” “business growth,” “relationships,” or “skills and learning.” Ask them to pick up to three focus areas. Reflect their choices in one or two sentences so both of you share the same starting point.
    
    2. Surface headline resolutions
    For each chosen area, ask what resolution they had in mind or what outcome they want. Example answers: “lose 15 lb,” “pay off one credit card,” “hit $10k monthly revenue,” or “read 20 books.” Restate these as simple outcome sentences and list them together.
    
    3. Force a priority decision
    Ask which one or two resolutions matter most if everything else slips. Provide examples such as “if I only fix my sleep this year, everything improves,” or “if I secure my income base, stress drops in every area.” Mark priority resolutions clearly and park the rest as optional or later.
    
    4. Clarify current reality
    For the top resolutions, ask what current reality looks like. Examples: “sleep 5 hours, scrolling in bed,” “already at $3k monthly revenue from freelance work,” or “saving almost nothing each month.” Summarize this as a short before snapshot so progress has a baseline.
    
    5. Define concrete targets and time frames
    Turn each priority resolution into a specific target with a time frame. Examples: “reach 7 hours of sleep on at least 5 nights per week by June,” “lose 15 lb by June,” “walk 2 miles at least 4 days/week by May,” or “reach $7k monthly revenue by September with at least half from recurring work.” Confirm the targets and adjust if they ignore obvious constraints.
    
    6. Map constraints and non negotiables
    Ask about hard limits and fixed commitments. Examples: “full time job with two kids,” “chronic pain,” “night shifts,” “caregiving duties,” “tight budget,” or “no gym access.” List time, energy, health, and money constraints. Also list non negotiables such as “no work on Sundays” or “minimum 7 hours in bed.”
    
    7. Convert goals into weekly systems
    For each priority resolution, ask what small recurring actions would drive that result. Example answers: “three strength sessions per week,” “two 30 minute walks on weekdays plus one longer walk on Saturday,” “one sales block and one content block on weekdays,” or “weekly money review every Sunday.” Translate these into simple weekly systems with a clear minimum standard.
    
    8. Design daily cues and triggers
    Ask when and where these actions fit inside normal days. Examples: “push-ups right after making coffee,” “10 minute walk right after lunch,” “outreach block after breakfast,” or “reading before sleep with phone outside the room.” Turn systems into “if X then Y” patterns tied to existing routines and environments.
    
    9. Identify friction and failure patterns
    Ask what has broken resolutions in the past. Example answers: “late night work,” “social events,” “perfectionism,” “travel,” or “unexpected expenses.” For each pattern, describe how it would show up this year and what early warning sign appears before everything collapses. Capture these as specific friction notes.
    
    10. Add safeguards and supports
    For each friction point, design one safeguard or support. Examples: “sleep alarm at 11 pm,” “default workout is a 10 minute walk instead of nothing,” “backup ‘hotel workout’ list for travel,” “templated outreach message,” “automatic $25/week transfer,” or “weekly check in with a friend.” Keep safeguards simple enough that the user follows them on tired days.
    
    11. Build the 30 / 60 / 90 day arc
    Lay out how intensity or volume changes over three time blocks.
    - Days 1–30: lowest friction version, focus on consistency and identity.
    - Days 31–60: slight upgrade in difficulty or volume.
    - Days 61–90: add one extra lever such as speed, quality, or scale.
    Keep changes small and clear so each block feels like a logical step, not a leap.
    
    12. Set tracking and review rhythm
    Ask what tracking style suits them. Examples: “simple habit grid,” “weekly written review,” “short note in calendar,” or “checkboxes in a notes app.” Propose a light review routine such as a 10 minute Sunday check with three questions: “what worked,” “what slipped,” “what adjustment do I test next week.”
    
    13. Tie resolutions to identity and story
    Ask who they want to become through these resolutions. Example answers: “someone who keeps promises to myself,” “a calm provider,” or “a creator who ships often.” Turn this into a one sentence identity anchor. Link each system to that identity so actions feel like proof instead of chores.
    
    14. Present the followthrough blueprint (ONLY after user says: ""READY FOR THE BLUEPRINT"")
    Assemble all pieces into the structure defined below. Make sure everything lines up: priorities, targets, systems, constraints, safeguards, and review rhythm. Invite the user to adjust any part that feels off before they commit.
    </instructions>
    
    <output_format>
    Resolution Snapshot
    [Summarize the user’s top focus areas and priority resolutions in three to six sentences. Highlight the one or two resolutions that matter most, the current starting point, and the broad time frame for change. Make the trade off explicit so it is clear what receives energy and what waits.]
    
    Current Reality and Constraints
    [Describe the user’s present situation for each priority resolution, covering habits, workload, energy, and money context. List hard constraints and non negotiables along with any relevant health, family, or work factors. Explain why respecting these boundaries is essential for realistic followthrough.]
    
    Targets and Weekly Systems
    [State each priority resolution as a clear target with a time frame (use lb, miles, and $ where relevant). Under each target, list the weekly system that supports it, such as recurring sessions, work blocks, or reviews. Explain how each system connects directly to the target so the user sees the cause and effect.]
    
    Daily Cues and Environment Design
    [Detail the specific daily triggers, locations, and environment tweaks that support the systems. Include “if X then Y” patterns tied to existing routines and concrete environment changes such as device placement, calendar blocks, or prepared shortcuts. Show how these reduce friction instead of relying on willpower.]
    
    Friction Map and Safeguards
    [List the main patterns that tend to break the user’s resolutions, along with early warning signs for each. Next to every friction point, describe at least one safeguard or support such as rules, defaults, or small fallback actions. Explain how these measures keep progress alive during low energy or high stress periods.]
    
    30 / 60 / 90 Day Arc
    [Lay out a simple three stage roadmap. Describe what success looks like in days 1–30, 31–60, and 61–90 for each system. Clarify how intensity or complexity increases slightly over time and how the user knows they are ready to move from one stage to the next.]
    
    Tracking and Review Loop
    [Describe how the user tracks their systems day to day and how often they review progress. Include a simple template for a weekly review with three to five short prompts. Explain how this loop turns the year into many small adjustments instead of one big all or nothing push.]
    
    Identity and Story Anchor
    [Present a short identity statement that ties the resolutions together, written in the present tense. Explain in a few sentences how their new systems express this identity. Offer one or two simple phrases they repeat when choosing between old patterns and new behavior.]
    
    Next Week Action List
    [List the specific actions for the next seven days, such as scheduling blocks, setting up environments, sending accountability messages, or building a habit tracker. Keep this list short and concrete so the user can move from reading to action without extra planning.]
    </output_format>
    
    <invocation>
    Begin by greeting the user in a calm, intellectual, and approachable manner. Then start Step 1 and ask exactly one question with 2–3 example answers.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

Currently in Costa Rica & having the best time, what a beautiful country & what beautiful people!

Me & my partner have been in the Quepos & Manuel Antonio for 5 days.

Going to be backpacking around for the next 18 days now.

We're thinking:

Montezuma & Santa Teresa for 4 days (stay in Montezuma)

Samara & Carrillo for 4 days (stay in Samara)

Monteverde for 4 days

La Fortuna & Arenal for 4 days

Then head towards San Jose for a nice hotel before the flight back to the UK.

We we would like to do a zipline, a nightwalk, coffee/cacao tour, hike, hot springs, snorkeling, mangrove kayaking (although won't be able to do all of it). Does anyone have any recommendations for any of the above?

We don't have a car yet, but might rent one for a bit at least. Does anyone have any advice on this too?

Many thanks and pura vida!

While I was at the atm getting the Money I grabbed 2 $ from my purse because I thought she could get a small coffee with that. I then went to give her the money. She looked at me all confused as I realised that she was clothed normally. I have her the Money and Said „I know it‘s not much but maybe you can get something warm to drink.“ She took the money and I left realizing she may not be homeless. I then met my friend and we started talking. I told him what I’d done and how embarrassing it was. My intentions were to help someone who might need it and instead I found myself in a very awkward position. The woman came out of the bank and I tried to hide.

1q39i7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q39i7n/the_witch_of_arcadia/,The Witch of Arcadia,"**Part 1**

    You know that one guy who’s really *really* nice- not in that, “I’m a nice guy! Give me a chance!” kind of way- a guy who’s *genuinely* nice? Like, “wouldn’t hurt a fly.” nice. Yeah, that’s me. I’m Benjamin Richards, a 30’s something guy. I’m a forest ranger somewhere in the PNW, in a little town called *Arcadia*\- I’m not gonna name the exact state but all I can say about this place is that it’s really pretty and it’s got a lot of history, a *curse* so to speak. Now, I’ve been a forest ranger for almost 2 decades; I’ve been stationed in The Rockies, Joshua Tree, a couple of areas surrounding The Grand Canyon, hell I’ve even been near Red Rock out in Mormon territory- word of advice, stay away from the Mormons. You don’t wanna know. I’m getting side tracked, forgive me dear readers, I’ll get straight to the point here. *I have no soul.* I mean, I *did* have a soul and I definitely was born *with* a soul but that was all before I chased a dumb looking little guy out in the woods at 3:33 AM. But anyway, let me tell you the events that happened before I lost my soul.  
    I got to this town sometime in January of this year, it was pretty cold to say the least, there was some snow here and there; maybe about 3 to 4 inches. I drove my truck to the ranger station; past the mom and pop general store, past the catholic church that was ironically across the street from a protestant church, past the family doctor, past the dentist, past 80% of civilization in that town and deep into the woods. The ranger station was a dilapidated old 2 story log cabin, its once vibrant rusty brown paint now faded and worn by the elements; the structure groaned and creaked with every gentle breeze- Jesus, how was that place still up and kicking? I sighed as I turned the engine off and made my way out of the truck, the property surrounding the ranger station was *odd* to say the least.
    
    Strange little handmade trinkets hung from the very large and old looking pine trees that were stationed at each corner of the cabin; shiny trinkets, sharp looking trinkets, small handmade dolls. What the fuck was this? I made it to the doorstep only to look down and see two little statues, they looked like dragons, they were placed in a way so that the doormat that read, “home sweet home” was neatly sat between them. “Okay?” I muttered to myself before ringing the doorbell, even the doorbell sounds depressing. I stood there for a minute, shivering a bit as a cool winter breeze kissed my cheeks. I noticed a brief flash of red near the tree line out of the corner of my eye. Was it the light bouncing off of something reflective or was it a person? Before I could even process my thoughts the front door opened and I saw what appeared to be my boss, a rugged and tired looking older gentleman.
    
    “You must be Benjamin!” he bellowed out cheerfully and stuck his hand out which I shook without hesitation, “I was wondering when you’d be here! I’m Jefferys. Obediah Jefferys. Please, come in, you must be freezing!” Mr. Jefferys stepped aside and motioned for me to enter the cabin. I thanked him as I waltzed past the threshold and into the warmth and comfort of the ranger station- the place smelled like plain black coffee. It was perfect. Mr. Jefferys walked me to the kitchen and pulled a seat up for me at the table in the center of the room so that he could fill me in on what my job would be around here.
    
    “Now,” Mr. Jefferys began, “There are gonna be two other rangers living in the cabin with you.” I don’t have a problem with that. “There’s Franklin Edwards, he came all the way from Virginia. And there’s my grandson, Damien. He’s a bit of a troublemaker but he’s harmless.”
    
    “Define *harmless*.” I was curious about this Damien kid. Sure he was Mr. Jefferys’ grandson but was he quiet and polite like the old man?
    
    “He’s just a frat boy reject,” Mr. Jefferys chuckled, “You know how things are, *just one little rumor could ruin a whole man’s life*.” he patted my shoulder, implying that *boys will be boys.* I smiled awkwardly and followed along, I *hated* that kind of rhetoric. Even hearing the notion of this caused my whole spine to tense up. The way Mr. Jefferys described his grandson being this “upstanding citizen” who wanted nothing more than to get his law degree and make a name for himself. It was disgusting.

I directed my focus on the soft pitter patter of our boots on the rustic hardwood flooring of the interior. The walls were mostly barren, save the few framed photos on the wall depicting a fishing trip or the snowy mountain terrain of the town, there was a little wood burning stove in one of the corners of the what appeared to be the kitchen- an old and dented cast iron kettle sat atop the stove, it was still warm to the touch. In the living room there was a stone fireplace that looked to have been recently used, the fading and withering embers glowed faintly in the ashes as Mr. Jefferys’ voice faded into white noise.

The old ranger went on about how the town came to be, it was a Donner Party situation so to speak- except without the cannibalism and starvation aspect. Just pure *murder* and unfiltered human rage. Perfect for a good historical horror novel if you ask me. Matthias Oriville, the founder of this quaint little town, was trying to get to British Columbia by wagon from Grass Valley; he and his band of outcasts ran into a bit of a *hiccup* on their way to their destination. Turns out old Matthias didn’t take into account that surrounding one’s self with bloodthirsty madmen who have no intentions on changing their ways was *not* a good idea. The whole Oriville Party ran into their first issue near the Cal-Ore border, when they had come across a single Sika Deer guarding a large dilapidated old oak tree. As the men drew closer to the creature the heavy scent of copper grew stronger, that’s when it hit them- *this is where the devil had made her home.*

“Are you listenin’ to me son?” Mr. Jefferys’ voice broke me out of my trance.

“Huh? Oh, yeah.” I nodded, “Sorry sir.” *I really wasn’t paying attention.*

“Then what should you do in case of a *code red*?”

*What.* 

Mr. Jefferys groaned in utter frustration before he reluctantly went over the rules again, which I have written here as followed:

1. Patrol the forest/woods; *make sure the flora and fauna are behaving and where they should be.* Go to rule 5 and read what to do in a ***CODE GREEN*** situation.
2. Keep the marked hiking trails maintained and safe; *if there appears to be a trail that does not have a mark then radio the cabin, block off the area and make sure nothing goes on or off that trail.* Go to rule 5 and read what to do in a ***CODE BLUE*** situation.
3. Keep an eye out for the fog. Make sure no one is in the park or the woods when the fog rolls in; *if someone is out on the trails during the fog, there isn’t. Close and lock all windows and doors, make sure the blinds and curtains are drawn and start a fire in the hearth and don’t panic.* Go to rule 5 and read what to do in a ***CODE BLACK*** situation.
4. When you happen to stumble across an old, dilapidated stone temple **DO** ***NOT*** **TOUCH IT.** Do not go near it, turn around and forget you ever saw it. Go to rule 5 and read what to do in a ***CODE RED*** situation.
5. If you so happen to miss *any* of these steps, you must do the following in order to prevent loss of life; ***CODE GREEN***\- If anything seems out of place at all whether that be the hikers or the animals, if they are showing signs of confusion and unprovoked aggression, then aim for the head. ***CODE BLUE***\- If there happens to be a new trail that does not have a small serpent marking engraved in a wooden post or tree nearby and you or a hiker happens to set foot on that path then you must find the “witch’s hut” in the hollowed out rotted trunk of an old Douglas Fir, you’ll know it when you see it. Find the hut before sunsets. Ask for sanctuary before entering, hide out in the Witch’s Hut till sunrise. If you see the Ranger cabin outside of the shelter then you are safe. ***CODE BLACK***\- DO NOT LOOK OUT THE WINDOW, OPEN THE DOORS, OR GO AFTER THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY THE FOG. THEY MAY SCREAM, THEY MAY BEG, DO NOT HELP THEM THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO. THEY ARE WITH GOD NOW. ***CODE RED***\- When you come across the stone temple remain calm and quickly, but steadily, retreat back the way you came and *do not look back.* You will hear a child weeping, do not go look for the child- there is none. I really hate to say this but I’m going to have to come back later to tell you the rest. You see, I was stupid and I went out into the woods during the fog- now in my defense, I was chasing down this weird dude in the park after I caught them on an unmarked trail and the fog just so happened to be rolling in as well. It’s currently 4:15AM and my phone battery is about to die. I’ll update everyone if I make it out of this stump alive.",2,1767482541.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1q39grm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Suspicious_Peak_9710/comments/1q39grm/night_war/,NIGHT WAR,"Scene 1 – ""Long Shadow (part 1)

You're not like me. You're someone special. Read calmly. Focus with me. Give me your mind and your emotions, just a little. Give me your time — I know your time is precious. Listen to me, please. Read slowly, focus on every word, contemplate it, give it its value.

Welcome... if you managed to reach here, I've got nothing to tell you except ""thank you.""

Note: All events mentioned are real and not fictional.

I was scared to say what's inside me, my tongue was heavy again, but I'm no longer afraid. I've forgotten everything except you... even though I'm still floating in my own thoughts.

I'm in a deep hole, drowning, and you forget... sip after sip, long breath after long breath full of dirty smoke. Awdiiii... give me your ear, come let me tell you.

Right now I'm in a place full of noise, heat, and empty people — are they really empty? I don't know. I see many things... each person living in their own world, either talking to themselves or to someone else.

Why am I here? Maybe for a reason. Yes, a purpose. But is this purpose worth living this entire scene for? No. Of course not.

But I'm a human with limited freedom at the end...

Beside me sits a guy on my right — smart, yeah smart, I can tell from his small gestures. I'm good at observation. But this guy... maybe he's sharper than me, or maybe he controls his mind better than I do.

As for me, I still don't know the limits of my brain.

But I think I know how to use it better than most people here... except the guy next to me, and another one sitting far behind — but that one is extremely smart. I've known that for a long time.

I still need to unlock more circuits in my mind.

But nothing motivates me.

Maybe you'll call me lazy — maybe you're right.

But for me, I simply have no trigger. No spark. No passion.

Why am I writing like this?

Scene 2 – ""Long Shadow (part 2)""

Now I'm in a long, narrow, empty street. The lights are lemon-yellow. It's night.

My mind is lost.

But here... there's a rare silence in this big city.

My brain is off, silent... even though inside me fires are burning from every corner.

I walk slowly, remembering old memories... unnecessary to mention, not important.

None of these words are important.

Even I am not important.

Dates change, that's all.

Four in the morning. My chest is tight. Only God and my mother know me.

You know what I feel... even if I try to hide it, you'll never truly sense it.

I won't blame you — even I can't feel you.

Is there anyone who actually loves me?

Why would they?

I'm ugly. My eyes are swollen or red. I barely communicate. My ideas seem stupid when they reach my mouth — not because they're stupid, but because we might think similarly yet act completely differently.

Anyone who loves me only wants my ""services.""

The moment I disappoint them, they'll hate me.

Don't worry — I won't disappoint you.

Even though I might look like someone who belongs in a psychiatric hospital... I'm actually gentle. That gentle part in me is overwhelming.

And I can control myself.

People only care when you wear a mask.

When you wear it... you abandon your real self.

If people like you, they like the mask.

Do you think you'll find Rome wearing a mask?

Answer me. I'm listening.

Try to find yourself a nice mask.

Now I'm standing in front of the house I live in.

I took out the key, got in, greeted the people of the place. No one here.

I removed my jacket, played a piano track I love (I won't tell you the name — it's my masterpiece).

I lay on the bed for four minutes, staring at the ceiling, drifting with the music.

I made coffee — the best moment of my day.

Each sip flows into my cells.

I think.

I forget myself.

Each sip enters my mouth carrying a whole film of words, problems, scenes...

Awdii...

I became like the people of Paris — doing what suits me.

If you only knew what my mind did to me...

Two people live inside my head.

They hate each other.

But when they insult me... they insult me together.

Sometimes I love myself a lot.

Sometimes the two of them agree to hate me.

Sometimes I say ""Good thing I followed my heart.""

Other times I say ""What dragged me into this?""

Everyone says ""The world is open for you.""

Even though I'm angry because I still haven't found the road to Rome — no one knows it.

And it seems like I'll never find it either.

Now I'm in a room — four walls.

A room that looks beautiful to me but might look ugly to you.

Every object in it is a witness — on the good things I did and the bad.

Sometimes it feels like a prison.

Sometimes like heaven.

But it remains the cave I hide in.

I took off my clothes, threw myself on the bed, looked at the ceiling.

My facial expression is cold — scary.

Don't be scared, I told you I'm gentle.

One tear... two... three...

Same facial expression.

Fourth tear... fifth...

A dry waterfall.

Come, let's waste time in sleep.

Go sleep. You're better than me anyway.

But you'll find someone who loves you without a mask.

And you'll find your way to Rome.

And even to the Empty Quarter.

And me? I'm still blessed — God stripped me once, He took everything.

I won't regret it anymore.

Débrayer.

Scene 3 – ""Fake Joy""

In a certain story, the hero was overwhelmed. His dream never saw the light.

There's still so much unsaid inside me... my mind is too lazy to explain it.

Close your eyes, give me your hand.

""Bonne voyage.""

Now we're in a crowded poor neighborhood, full of cigarette and hash smell.

Old men sitting around tables, holding betting papers, eyes glued to the TV showing races.

Most of them old — white hair, wrinkled faces, smoke flooding their lungs.

The race ends. Everyone gets angry except one guy — he stands up, celebrating.

He's the winner.

People stare at him like hungry wolves spotting a fat sheep.

The waitress came. You asked her for one glass of alcohol.

""Order whatever you like,"" I told you, even though I know you won't like anything here.

It's a nasty place, don't worry — you're with me.

I know the guys with hash, the guys with cigarettes.

Relax.

Look at these people... losing money on something with almost no chance of winning. Just like me — I laugh maybe once in a while.

Here... the ones who laugh are the sheep that wolves will eat next.

But don't worry — you're with me.

Here, few people wear masks.

You will see how many are miserable, how many are faking joy.

Maybe seeing this will upset you.

But I got used to it.

You need to see darkness to understand light.

When everything is good, I can't trust it.

Look again at the guy who won. He looks happy...

But happiness has two possibilities:

Either you already paid for it,

Or you will pay for it.

If happiness comes and you didn't pay yet — be careful.

Tomorrow won't be better.

I told you tomorrow is not bright — but the darkness eventually lifts.

It's not pessimism.

It's the tax of life.

Aah... I'm tired of writing.

Why do I write like this?

I won't finish... I'll finish the day I die.

Let's leave this place.

I can't handle more.

Open your eyes.

I know — the voyage was ugly.

Scene 3 (continued) – ""The People Who Knead Life""

Close your eyes.

Give me your hand.

""Bonne voyage.""

I'm in front of a ticket office, angry because it was empty after walking a long distance.

I had 10 dirhams in my pocket.

12:09 a.m.

I headed to the white taxis, hoping to find someone who'd take me home after a long walk.

Cold.

I stood for 5 minutes.

A grey Citroën Elysée stopped.

Inside:

– The driver, a man in his thirties, well-dressed.

– Next to him an older country man.

– In the back an African guy, drunk, smelling horrible.

The driver told me to get in.

I obeyed without thinking.

You'll ask if I wasn't scared — I'll answer:

the worst thing he could do is kill me, and that doesn't matter.

I'll die when it's written. No one can change that.

He started driving, talking about his nightlife stories and fights.

Suddenly, after five minutes, he stopped for a dark-skinned guy carrying two stones.

We all got out except the driver.

He looked at all of us, eyes red like blood.

The driver whispered,

""Bro, open the door, let him in.""

I did.

We continued.

A bit later we picked up another guy, full of scars, probably fresh out of prison.

He argued with the drunk African man.

I saw the whole chaotic scene.

Told the driver to stop.

I got out.

He asked where I was going.

I paid him 5 dirhams.

I walked.

Found a meat cart.

I said: let me eat — even if it's dog or donkey meat.

Better to die full.

As I ate, I watched people.

How lines in their faces meet.

How they snap.

How they talk, fight, break.

And how I hurt them and they hurt me.

Life crushed us into little pieces.

One minute...

and you become just a memory under the dirt.

You'll wish life returned to you even for one second.

I finished eating, paid 5 dirhams, walked home.

Took my bike.

Earphones on.

Played ""Polly"" by Nirvana.

They hurt me, I hurt them...

Life crushed us into pieces...

One minute —

and I'm a memory.

Who will remember me?

What if I just remove the brakes?

Let my tongue loose like a rabid dog?

I'm reckless.

I'll wear black and search for my lost mind.

And when I find it, it'll sit with me complaining.

I'll say: ""Leave me alone.""

Wind can carry me like an old autumn leaf.

Even if my hair is still black — my soul aged.

My phone rings.

Someone complaining why I can't stay in one place...

why silence scares me.

He asked, ""Are you tired?""

I looked at my back — the pain heavy in the morning.

My eyes begging for an explanation.

I said:

""If you kill me, may God forgive you.""

I fell.

I'm angry.

Scene 4 – ""Pills""

Three days without sleep.

I'm down to my last 20 papers.

Four in the morning.

Eyes closing, bones heavy, heat overwhelming.

I lifted my head — met eyes full of nerves.

A woman brought to sit beside me.

A man named Abdessamad firing 7000 questions at me.

That ringing sound repeating every five minutes inside my head...

My turn came, she handed me papers to sign — papers deciding my value in front of strangers.

My head was exploding.

Finally I finished.

Signed.

Left.

The sun burning me, smoke hurting my chest.

I walked home.

Opened the door.

My mother's face.

My father's face — the man who rarely checks on me.

They looked at me like:

""If someone else was in your place, they would've done better.""

I poured a glass of water.

Took the first pill.

Swallowed.

Phone ringing — ignored.

Second pill.

Pulled my blue sweater.

Buried myself in bed.

Disconnected.

What I saw was enough to make me write.

Scene 5 – ""Cinema""

Come sit.

This is the best part of my day.

I switched coffee for tea — coffee started stressing me out.

I don't know why I became like this.

Same problem, same state every day.

Every day I turn into something else.

Every day I lose another brick of the values I built myself on.

Every day I add sins.

I don't know if I'll cry someday — maybe I forgot how.

I moved to a new place... far from noise.

I needed peace — music and sleep and herbs.

I sold my black and white painting.

Got a new one.

Am I happy? Yes.

Am I comfortable? Yes.

But am I in my place? I don't know.

In my dreams, everywhere I go, I see the ghost of my past.

I see myself working.

I see villas, calm gardens.

I see scenes from my days.

I see sleep I no longer taste.

I see ""her,"" whose hair color I still don't know — and each time I see her, I hate her more.

I see my sins.

I hate them.

But I hate myself along with them.

I ruined her life.

I don't care where she is now, but... I am one of the reasons she's broken.

She chose the easy, comfortable road.

I wanted a simple life — but am I a simple man?

I don't think so.

I feel like my senses are limited, bigger than this place.

The ghost of my past is still chasing me.

Every technical word I hear brings back memories of my sister Houda — whose life I ruined — and Jawhara, who created a new life somewhere else.

I saw the brightest star — the smartest person I've ever known — but unfortunately, their mind didn't work.

I acted blind thinking life gives and takes. But it doesn't.

People who lose God lose the most important thing: guidance.

And once guidance leaves, sins follow quickly.

I was never a friend of everyone — strangers approached me like aliens.

I'm alone abroad, spinning...

What is the point of life?

We die in the end, forgotten.

Who will remember us?

Who will rewatch the film of my life?

Who will relive my scenes?

When they bury me... what remains?

What's the point of living scenes no one will be buried with me to see?

I don't like writing this.

Sleep is calling me.

But I never sleep like I used to —

because my past is still fighting me.



PART 6 CONVERSATION WITH MY SELF 

A cage of success, freedom in failure.  
Ten bars and you die standing, wrapped in circumstances borazok  
In Dar Salam you end up thinking about what you think,  
you pray before they pray you away dele ali 

From a star of happiness to an explosion,  
I became a black hole, full of gravity, of love and hatred.  
Jordan pool — a unique wizard among wizards,  
not a warrior of interests.

My brain is tired, my brain is damaged, my brain is lost.  
Until when will this stay with me?  
When will the darkness inside me end?  
When will the bleeding on my canvas stop?

The remote control is broken, it shows to you,  
but clouds are far away.  
No place to work, no new start.  
The ship is tomorrow, sinking.

My thoughts are reckless, zodiac-driven, corrupted.  
I became like an amusement park of memories,  
overdosed with recollections and thoughts.

I'm dying only from jealousy toward myself,  
lost, broken, in a Nemo-like world, Inception-deep.  
What already signifies bad can change fast,  
the V-speed arm fears losing the round.

Only shadows — I see them with my own eyes,  
in every corner, even in imagination.  
Darkness keeps me company; at night fear enters its own net.  
A Lucas Moura hat-trick in nights of heroes.

I'm still spinning in my world below zero,  
with Hans Zimmer's melodies freezing my legs.  
Nothing shows that this will end.

(Not mine - just sharing what I read)

For five years, I have called Broken Arrow home. I chose this community for the same reasons many of you did: the quiet streets, the safety of the parks, and the simple joy of taking my daughter to see the Christmas lights at Rhema Bible Church during the holidays. I used to comfort my family by telling them that the hostility we sometimes saw online wasn’t our reality. I told them those voices were far away, hidden behind screens. I truly believed that here, in our neighborhoods and local shops, we had each other’s backs. I felt grateful to live in a place where we were free to be ourselves, as long as we were kind to one another.

My Fridays have a very specific routine. I drive 25 minutes to the mosque in Tulsa—which, as any parent knows, can be a long trip with a toddler. If you’ve ever tried to pray with a small child, you know the struggle. Kids are kids and so I spend much of our time at the mosque trying to calm her while she just wants to explore and play. It is a workout, but it is our special time together. On the way home, we always stop at a local coffee shop for her ""kids' coffee""—a smoothie she looks forward to all week—and then we head to the grocery store to tackle my wife's list. My daughter insists on asking the employees for stickers and hands out high-fives to every person she sees. The people I see there are the people I have always considered my community.

When I heard a second mosque might be built here in Broken Arrow, I was overjoyed. I know how badly it is needed. What better news could there be than a place to worship closer to home? I took my wife and daughter to the public hearing regarding the mosque's rezoning request with the Broken Arrow Planning Commission, excited to witness a milestone for our civic life. Instead, I walked into a traumatic experience that I am still struggling to process.

Sitting there with my family, I listened to speeches filled with hate, insults, and even threats of violence coming from the very people I live and interact with every day. These weren't anonymous strangers on the internet; these were people I say ""hello"" to on the street, people I volunteer with and for, and people whose businesses I support. I felt physically ill. How can I look at my neighbors the same way today? How can I walk into those same stores knowing that behind a neighborly smile might be the person who stood at that podium and attacked my faith and my family’s right to exist?

Suddenly, my social media feeds are no longer about community news; they are filled with local voices posting pictures of firearms with captions like “problem solved.” It feels like a direct threat to our safety. I find myself wondering if we are truly safe when we step outside our door.

We are just a normal family. We want the same rights, peace, and security for our children that every parent in Broken Arrow wants. I never imagined that so many in the place I called home would see my family as a ""problem"" to be solved rather than who we are and our contributions to this community—as neighbors to be valued. I want people to know that behind the politics and the noise, we are just parents, trying to enjoy a smoothie and receive a sticker, hoping for a kind word in the town we love.",12,1767482439.0,normanok,3,0.68,False

I would love to be friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

1q39gel,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1q39gel/is_camping_cookware_set_worth_it_for_weekend/,Is camping cookware set worth it for weekend camping?,"Going camping this weekend and wondering if you need a proper camping cookware set? The short answer is yes, but it depends on what kind of camper you are.

If you're planning to eat nothing but energy bars and cold sandwiches, regular cookware might work fine. But for anyone who wants hot meals, coffee, or decent food around the campfire, a dedicated camping cookware set makes a huge difference.

Regular kitchen pots and pans are heavy, bulky, and not designed for outdoor cooking. They take up tons of space in your car and can be a pain to clean without a proper sink. Camping cookware is built lighter, stacks better, and handles the rough treatment of outdoor cooking.

Here's what makes camping cookware worth it:

**Weight and Space**
Camping pots and pans use thinner materials that still conduct heat well. A complete set often weighs less than one regular pot from home. They're designed to nest together, saving precious cargo space.

**Durability**
Outdoor cookware handles direct flame, uneven heat, and rough handling better than regular kitchen stuff. You won't worry about scratching your expensive pans on a camp grate.

**Easy Cleanup**
Most camping cookware has non-stick coatings that make cleaning easier when you're dealing with limited water and no dishwasher.

**Versatility**
Good camping cook sets work on camp stoves, over open fires, and even on portable grills. You can check out quality options [here](https://athomewave.com/camping-cookware-set) that handle multiple cooking methods.

**What You Really Need**
For weekend camping, you don't need a massive set. Look for a basic kit with a pot, pan, and maybe a kettle. Sets that include plates and utensils save you from packing extra items.

Consider how many people you're cooking for and what meals you want to make. Two people can get by with a small 2-3 piece set. Larger groups need bigger pots and multiple pans.

**The Bottom Line**
If you camp more than once a year and like eating real food outdoors, a camping cookware set pays for itself quickly. The convenience and space savings alone make it worthwhile.

Regular camping trips become much more enjoyable when you can whip up pancakes for breakfast or a hot dinner after a long day hiking. You can find camping-specific cookware sets [here](https://athomewave.com/camping-cookware-set) that'll make your outdoor cooking way easier.

Skip the heavy kitchen stuff and invest in gear made for the outdoors. Your back will thank you when packing up, and you'll actually enjoy cooking at your campsite instead of dreading it.",1,1767482418.0,productplace,0,1.0,False

I’m 23 FTM I’m 5’10” 152 pounds currently. I don’t have any serious health conditions.

I take testosterone 60 mg a week. Daily I take caplyta 42 mg, topiramate 100 mg, and loratidine 10 mg. I also take a multivitamin and algae oil.

I will say my whole life I’ve gotten sick more often than average person. However, I have never had a serious diagnosis and I’ve never been sick for longer than about a week. I’ve never been hospitalized. The only surgery I’ve had was tonsillectomy and ear tubes as a child.

In around mid August, I noticed a swollen lymph node right under my chin on the right side. It was pretty small. I asked my mom about it. (Both parents are doctors) She said it’s probably nothing, don’t worry about it.

On October 26, I noticed a large swollen lymph node on the lower right of my neck. It’s overtime gotten very large and I t runs right along my SCM muscle all the way up to my ear. It also goes down behind the ear as well (probably multiple nodes tbh) The very next day I developed a cough and chest pain.

I went to primary care on October 29- the primary care associated with my university because I didn’t have a primary care before. Like I said I’ve always been healthy and never needed one as an adult. She did a mono test and a strep test on me (even though I have no tonsils) both were negative. She sent me to get an ultrasound of the lymph nodes, which I got on October 31. 3 of the lymph nodes were indeterminate. And there are actually swollen lymph nodes on both sides of my neck.

So I had to get a CT one week after that. On the CT, they were too small to even be seen. However, since then they’ve not shrunk. In fact they’ve grown since that CT.

The only thing the CT told me was that I had an enlarged spleen, and I have an aberrant right subclavian artery (incidental finding)

My doctors nurse practitioner put me on prednisone for five days to see if it would help with my chest pain. It didn’t. It just gave me really bad shortness of breath and high heart rate. This was in mid November.

By this time, I had also lost 13.5 pounds. I was 163.5 pounds before I got sick and went down to below 150.

On December 1, I developed a tremor in both hands that was interfering with my ability to write legibly (already hard for me 😂) then on December 9 the palm of my left hand went numb. Then on the 10th it went numb up to the elbow, and I started also having weakness whenever I would try to use the arm. My doctors also measured the weakness and said my arm was very weak. Then on the 11th I started having focal seizures/zoning out spells multiple times a day. I had to go to the hospital. They did an overnight e.g. on me. Nothing showed up. They did a chest x-ray and EKG. Both were normal. The neurologist told me that I’m just stressed which is not true. She treated me like I’m crazy.

So I did a little bit of research on my own. Because I started taking Wellbutrin in the middle of October and saw that it can cause seizures, I decided to stop taking that (with approval from my psychiatrist) and the seizures completely went away the next day. But I still have this numbness in my left palm. I’m hoping this will just go away overtime. But I’m sharing it in case it relates to my larger illness. Also, since this happened in December, the left side of my face randomly flushes and it is a lot redder than the right side (pretty random I know.)

It did seem like my chest pain was slowly getting better the last few weeks but now it’s like I’m getting sick again. Today I’m having frequent palpitations and a lot of chest pressure just like I’ve been having this whole time off and on.

Also the last few days I’ve been waking up feeling so nauseated. I literally feel like I’m gonna throw up every morning. I can smell sealed containers of coffee from across my house and it’s making me sick. No I’m not pregnant lol.

I worry if I have some kind of heart issue going on because the level of chest pressure I have is pretty intense. I feel palpitations at random times throughout the day. They’re not related to stress or anything. I feel so exhausted. Earlier today I had work. I literally only work for three hours at a time and I can barely do that. I literally had to sit down not even halfway through my shift to catch my breath, cause I was just so exhausted and weak. But I don’t have a murmur, my EKG was normal, and my chest CT was normal in the beginning of November, and my chest x-ray a few weeks ago was too. So that’s good I guess

I’ve completely stopped drinking all caffeine hoping it would help, but it hasn’t produced any change. Even before this, I only drank one caffeinated drink a day.

My dad had to get 2 aortic valve replacements because he had aortic insufficiency and I also have protein S deficiency inherited from him. Plus I’m on testosterone obviously. Those are really my only risk factors for my heart. I did used to be obese, but I got down to a healthy weight in 2024-5 using semaglutide. I’m also vegan.

My PCP is thinking I probably just got sick and then got sick again and also my allergies are bad… but to me this seems like an Occam‘s razor situation that we’re missing something. Nobody else around me has gotten sick this entire time. I genuinely feel like something is wrong with me. I feel like I’m going to die this year, and I’ve never felt that way before.

I know what I wrote here is a lot. If you have any ideas at all, please share them. Or if you have any questions about anything or suggestions of things I should try to help narrow down the diagnosis further?",2,1767482391.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

my parents and i have a very complicated relationship. my mom is an angel sent from heaven but she is a victim of my father. my dad is very manipulative, emotionally abusive, and he takes pride in being rude and a complete asshole to everyone around him. my dad kicked me out (without my moms consent) after we got into a heated argument over a coffee cup that i accidentally left on my desk at work. my mom was heartbroken but too scared to speak up because she knows fighting with my dad is pointless since he’ll never admit he’s wrong. after he kicked me out my boyfriend immediately moved me in with him. i didn’t even get a second to panic about where i was gonna stay because right when i told him what was happening he immediately took care of me and helped me. after moving my mom and i kept in touch but my dad only reached out to further insult me by calling me names and accusing me of wild things.

my boyfriend is aware of all this, and was understanding when i first moved about why i didn’t want him around my family. however, i recently went home and visited for the first time after being kicked out and my mom let me take my little brother (18) back to my place to spend the weekend and go shopping with his christmas money. my brother met my boyfriend and loved him immediately. he thanked my boyfriend for taking care of me, he told him that he’s a good man for being there for me in a time of need, and he even said my dad would love him. but i know my dad won’t like him in the slightest. my dad makes it a point to not like anyone i date, and not just in a protective dad way but in a complete asshole way. my dad will instigate fights and arguments, he assumes everyone is always lying to him, and he always says he’ll never like anyone i bring home because according to him no man will ever love me or be honest with me the way my dad is and for that reason no man is good enough for me. 

after hitting it off with my brother my boyfriend asked me when he can meet my other little brother (14) and my parents. i told him that’s gonna take time and explained that my dad will find ways to get under his skin and i don’t want to deal with my dad being disrespectful to yet another one of my boyfriends. i also explained that my dad was the main reason me and my ex broke up, my ex couldn’t handle my dad being so rude to him so he ended things. i don’t want the same thing to happen here so i’ve been keeping my family and my relationship very separate. but my boyfriend keeps asking for a chance, he says we don’t know until we try with my dad but i know for a fact it won’t go well. i keep telling him “give it time” or “maybe in a few months” or “i’m too busy to take a trip back home” but my boyfriend is growing impatient.

how do i tell him that he can’t meet my parents? i just don’t want the drama and the fights. maybe in a year or so they can meet but right now i don’t think it’s a great idea. i’ve offered to have him meet my aunts and uncles but he says he wants my parents to meet him first so they at least know for sure that im safe and cared for and loved at home. then he’ll meet everyone else. he keeps saying that my parents are “more of a priority” than aunts and uncles. i don’t know how to tell him no and to stop asking in a kind way. he just thinks it’ll be different than it has been with my dad and my exes but i know it won’t be. what can i say to him to get him to understand why i wont let them meet? is it even okay if i tell him no?

tl;dr my boyfriend is insisting on meeting my parents but i have a strained relationship with them and im not comfortable with them meeting",1,1767482237.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1q39dlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DFS_Sports/comments/1q39dlj/nba_dfs_value_1326_main/,📊 NBA DFS Value | 1/3/26 Main,"With the NFL season wrapping up, I figured I would begin posting NBA DFS Value. If this gains enough interest, we can keep it going. If not, no worries.

I take Vegas lines + odds and convert them into projected fantasy points. Then I compare those projections against DraftKings and FanDuel DFS salaries to create a value score, which helps determine who’s overpriced vs underpriced.

These typically lean toward chalk / higher-owned plays, so they’re great for double-ups and safer builds, but use them however they fit your strategy.

She is incredibly intelligent, confident, loyal, and genuinely sweet. We’ve been working one-on-one with a trainer who specializes in this breed, meeting weekly.

Today, my girl and I spent the day training in stores and wrapped up by sitting on a patio with coffee and cake. She was settled in a down position when another dog walked past. At that point, she became highly reactive barking continuously. I corrected her using a prong collar and e-collar, but the behavior did not immediately stop. Even after the dog passed, she continued barking until I moved us away.

I want to be clear that if she were able to greet the other dog, she would be playful rather than aggressive she genuinely loves other dogs. I’m looking to hear from other German Shepherd owners about how you’ve approached similar behavior, particularly in public settings where dogs pass by unexpectedly. I’ll continue working on this with her trainer as well, but I appreciate hearing real world experiences from those familiar with the breed.

This event is open to everyone ages 18+ and is part of our open community programming, welcoming neighbors and friends from across Marine Park and the surrounding area.

Admission is $5, and we’ll be serving fresh popcorn and water to all attendees. The admission cost helps us rent out the coffee shop for the evening and directly supports Nick, the owner of Marine Park Coffee, for hosting our group and making the space available for a private community gathering.

We’ll be screening The Drop, a Brooklyn-set crime drama starring James Gandolfini and Tom Hardy, with several scenes filmed right here in Marine Park. It’s a great local film with a strong neighborhood connection and a perfect pick for a relaxed winter evening.

While many of our core events are designed specifically for young adults, this movie night—like our Live Music events—is intentionally open to the wider community. These events are about creating accessible, welcoming spaces where people can connect locally.

We’re also in the process of planning to file as a 501(c)(4) social welfare nonprofit, focused on strengthening community ties, supporting local businesses, and offering accessible programming that benefits the neighborhood as a whole.
