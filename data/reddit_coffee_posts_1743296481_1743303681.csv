1jn39ay,https://i.redd.it/o603ffjfsqre1.jpeg,need advice for total beginner,"hi! i basically need a ‘diy for dummies’ run down..i got this neat storage-having side table for free. it actually matches my coffee table perfectly in color.

how do i go about makin’ it less beat-up lookin’? 

im aware of sanding being my likely first step but i have no idea what grit or tools are appropriate (like, is sandpaper okay, or is that gonna be way too long and should i just invest in a tool for it..?) or how to try and match the color for staining it. cause, only the top is super mesed up, with the bottom’s blemishes being minor to me so id rather not sand the whole thing if i dont *have* to.

I've been doing pretty good in life generally - worked hard in school and I work a well paying job now, have my own apartment, I'm fit and healthy, etc.

But I've always struggled with making genuine friends and having success dating. Despite my stability, I've felt very bitter and angry at the world - because I've tried so hard to go to different events and places and socialize and meet people, but no one really seems to connect with me or invest in me the way I do for them. It feels like no one actually cares to be my friend.

I've gotten dates, but a lot of the time women have just gotten free coffees and drinks out of me, and the dates never get anywhere. I am a good looking guy, pretty smart and bookish, and I would say I can be charming, but I guess being 5'7 has held me back a bit. 

I feel so jaded and isolated from the world because I feel like I have so much to give, but the world doesn't see it. 

Whenever I visit home, I try to be happy around my parents and younger brother but it's so hard. I can't help but project all my negativity onto them. I am an absolute vibe kill in the household - the air feels heavier whenever I'm around. My parents want me to be happy so bad, but they can't do anything to help me. They think I'm an incel and a social outcast.

I have tarnished my relationship with my brother - we used to talk and hang out, but now he doesn't even care to speak to me. He is just cordial to me. He is way more extroverted and popular than me - and I have a feeling he thinks I'm some weird freak.

I have no reason to live anymore. I am insignificant to the world and I am a burden to my family. They think I'm a monster. I don't see the point of continuing to live anymore. ",1,1743303513.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1jn358c,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWorldResorts/comments/1jn358c/trip_recap_resort_only_split_stay_and_free_water/,Trip recap: resort only split stay and free water park.,"
I love reading other people’s trip and watching vlogs on YouTube so I figure I can share my awesome 2 night spring break stay with my 6 and almost 3 year old. I want to show how much fun you can have without going to the parks! 

We recently let our annual passes expire because my youngest is turning 3 and I didn’t want to have different expiration dates and also, with all the construction going on, I don’t see going to the parks as worth it for the next couple years. Also, we visited several times this past year so we decided to give it a break.
However, I still love Disney and the resorts and I’m always down for a quick getaway. 
I found a 1 night confirmed reservation at the Polynesian for $300 through a Facebook group for DVC rental points that coincided with my daughter’s spring break, so we decided to go for it and do a 2 night split stay with Caribbean beach (got a 5th sleeper room for just under $300 with the FL resident discount) to enjoy the water park on our second day check in.

We live 3 hours away. 

First day: arrive at Caribbean beach resort around 12:30, had lunch at the quick service (delicious and super quick), then walked to the playground where my kids had a blast playing then changed into our bathing suits and went in the pool. The main pool is super nice, but a bit small for such a large resort. The kids loved the splash pad and overall it was a great time. Our room was ready around 1:30. We were assigned a room at the Aruba section which is right next to the Riviera. I originally wanted Trinidad for the Under the sea theming for the 5th sleepers, but I am so glad we got Aruba! The room was spacious and convenient.
We took a break around 4 and watched some TV (watching Bluey at the Disney hotel is part of the experience) and then got ready for dinner. We took the skyliner from the Riviera (an experience in itself and probably my kids favorite Disney ride 😆) to Art of Animation and walked around the cars section because my 2 year old is a cars fan! We had dinner at their quick service (bad; slow service and crowded, you can feel this is a value resort when compared to moderate and deluxe tbh). But we just wanted something quick. Then when we were walking out; they were showing their movie under the stars and it was Lilo and Stitch (my daughter’s favorite movie). We watched for about 30-45 mins and then decided to head back to the hotel around 9 and we caught the tail end of the Epcot fireworks from the skyliner. So awesome! 

Day 2: we woke up around 7:30 and quickly got ready and walked to the Riviera quick service (Primo Piatto) for breakfast. It was delicious! Their lemon blueberry pancakes are amazing! Totally recommend for an in between quick service and table service breakfast! We walked back to our resort, packed up and put on our bathing suits and head over to Blizzard beach. We arrived right at 10 am and it was empty. We grabbed a great spot by Tikes Peak and my kids had a blast there. We went around the lazy river (which is amazing) and then took the lift up to team boat springs and it was the best! Then spent some time at sky patrol training camp. My daughter loved it. 
We grabbed a Mickey pretzel and decided to leave around 1:30 because it was getting very crowded (most people arrive around that time since it is free on check in day). We drove to the Poly and even though our room wasn’t ready we had lunch at Captain cooks (delicious) and grabbed a dole whip and just relaxed. Our room was ready around 4:00 pm and we immediately got in and took a nap. 
Around 7:00, my daughter and I walked to Wailulu Grill to put our names on the walk up list because it was showing on the app it was over 60 mins. When I got there it actually said they were no longer seating people but I was able to put my name on the list and the wait was 90 mins.
In the meantime, my daughter played on the Moana splash pad (it’s the kind of splash pad you don’t need to have a bathing suit for, she just went in between the water) and literally played for like an hour. Our table was actually ready at 8 and they sat us inside on a table that had direct view of the castle. At 8:30 the fireworks started and they pipe the music. It was amazing! We were even able to see tinker bell fly. I totally recommend timing your visit around fireworks.
The food was absolutely delicious. We had the sweet potato hummus, poke bowl and loco moco and the kids had chicken and burgers, delicious! 
Then since we took such late naps, we decided to go around the monorail because ny kids love it lol.

Day 3: woke up around 7:30, walked to Ohana’s (had a reservation at 7:45 and we got there around 8:20 and they sat us right away). We got an amazing  view! Right over the splash pad overlooking the castle.
My kids liked the waffles and sausage. The food is ok. Nothing special. And service was bad, we kept waiting for our coffee. But the characters make up for it and we couldn’t pass out the opportunity of having breakfast with Lilo and stitch while staying at the poly. 
We then went back to the room, got into our bathing suits and packed everything and loaded up the car. Then we went to the pool and the splash pad. Then my kids were hungry and cold (it was windy and my kiddos ate Floridians) so we took a shower by the bathrooms at the pool and changed and I grabbed the noodles and burger from captain cooks for my kids and went to Wailulu again. We were seated outside again with beautiful views of the castle and had the shishito peppers and  wayfinder burger (omg amazing) and the chocolate cake (yummy!). 
After that, it was around 2, my kids played in the sand for a bit and then we made our way to the car. 
We came home with full hearts! It was truly an awesome time!
Just want to share how Disney is so much more than the parks and there is just so much it has to offer when compared to other resorts. It is truly a magical place all around!

A veritable buffet of…*things*.

And me? A paragon of nail hygiene. A meticulous cleaner, a veritable scrub-nurse of the cuticle. So, witnessing this…*display*…was, shall we say, triggering. A visceral, bone-deep *trigger*. PigThai, indeed. More like ""Pig-how-can-you-function-with-those-under-your-nails?"" It was a distraction of epic proportions. I couldn't process anything else.

Anyhow, we descended into the abyss of Tim’s “get ready with me.” First, a grand unveiling of her iced coffee, sipped, naturally, from a *food container*. Because why use a cup when you can repurpose giant glass food container?

Then came the PR haul, a veritable mountain of freebies from Dearcloud and Milani. The dogs, bless their canine souls, reacted with the appropriate level of chaos as Fatlos wrestled with the trash.

She then regaled us with tales of her ""smooth"" and ""dry"" skin, a daily mantra, while I, dear reader, was trapped in a nail-induced trance. If she couldn't manage basic nail hygiene, what other bodily horrors lay hidden? An ""A-type personality,"" she claimed. Honey, no you are not.  The foundation application, it takes her an eternity to apply foundation, probably because she's trying to cover a geographical area the size of a small country.

Then came the Facebook confession. Apparently, Facebook is just a tool for Tim to snoop on her high school frenemies and neighborhood busybodies. The wistful reminiscence of youthful dreams. Marriage by 23, babies by 25. A plan so well crafted, so beautifully…*naive*. Much like the state of her nails, those plans had clearly taken a detour into the realm of ""utterly derailed."" She then declared her 20s a ""rollercoaster of best and worst,"" a sentiment I, trapped in my own personal nail-induced hellscape, could tragically relate to.

YouTube, it turned out, was born of depression and a deep-seated loathing for nursing. A creative escape, if you will, from the sterile halls of medicine to the chaotic world of online fake personalities. She opens up about her Vietnamese family and the lack of emotional support.  Tim's suddenly a parenting guru. After spending half her vlogs showing off her nail-farms, now she's going to lecture us on emotional availability? Spare me. It's not ""vulnerability,"" it's a calculated attempt to humanize herself after a week of showcasing her utter lack of basic hygiene. Let's see if this ""emotional availability"" lasts longer than her last diet. I'm betting it won't.

From nursing to YouTube, from corporate drone to mukbang maven, Tim's journey was a series of chaotic pivots. She spoke of the toxic beauty industry, the pressures, the collaborations gone awry. And then, like a phoenix rising from the ashes of eyeshadow palettes, she found her true calling: mukbang and boring lifestyle vlogging!  Yea, for us.

1jn33wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1jn33wu/how_i_streamlined_my_ecommerce_operations_after/,How I Streamlined My Ecommerce Operations After Trying Both Todoist and ClickUp (My Honest Comparison),"Hey fellow e-commerce warriors,

Running my online store nearly broke me last holiday season. I was drowning in spreadsheets, missed shipping deadlines, and completely dropped the ball on two product launches because my task management system was basically ""panic and coffee.""

After that disaster, I knew something had to change. I was losing money and my sanity trying to manage inventory, marketing campaigns, supplier communication, and customer service with my cobbled-together system of post-its and emergency Slack messages.

I narrowed my options down to Todoist and ClickUp – two productivity tools that kept coming up in my research. Over the past 6 months, I've implemented both (separately) in my business, and the difference has been night and day.

**For inventory management:** ClickUp's custom fields and automation capabilities absolutely transformed how we track stock levels. We created a dashboard that automatically flags low-stock items and triggers reorder tasks assigned to the right team member. This alone prevented at least 3 stockouts that would have cost us thousands.

Todoist worked well for smaller operations, but as we scaled to managing 200+ SKUs, its simplicity became a limitation. That said, its clean interface made onboarding new team members incredibly easy.

**For marketing campaigns:** This is where things got interesting. Todoist's simple but powerful date functions made it perfect for our content calendar and social media scheduling. The friction-free mobile app meant I could assign urgent tasks to my VA while checking inventory at our fulfillment center.

However, ClickUp's Gantt views and dependency features gave us a massive advantage when coordinating larger product launches. We could visualize the entire campaign flow and automatically adjust deadlines when inevitable shipping delays happened.

Neither tool is perfect – Todoist lacks the visual campaign planning features we needed, while ClickUp has a steeper learning curve that slowed down implementation.

I ended up writing a detailed comparison of both tools from an e-commerce perspective on [my blog](https://baizaar.tools/todoist-vs-clickup-productivity-comparison/) if anyone's interested in the full breakdown of features, pricing, and implementation strategies specific to online retail operations.

What productivity tools are you using to manage your e-commerce business. I'd be quite intrigued to understand if anyone has found ""their"" own personal perfect solution(s) for balancing inventory management with marketing execution + more?",1,1743303016.0,ecommerce,0,1.0,False

My husband (30m) and I (23f) just had our first baby. He is now 6 months old. We had quite the traumatic experience bringing our son into the world through an emergency c section. Due to how my husband stepped up those first 30 hours of my son’s life I was so thankful and thought we would make a wonderful team doing this together. That help quickly faded. 

I was determined to breastfeed and because of my c section I had trouble getting out of bed to go get our baby. We researched co sleeping and started following the safe 7 guide so I could feed my baby without having to get out of bed as often. This led to me clearly taking the lead on feeding the baby and taking care of him at night. 

Breast feeding was really difficult and painful in the beginning. My baby would cry, I would try and feed him and that often ended with me crying myself because of the pain and feeling like a failing mom. My husband would just hide his head under his pillow and pretend to be asleep every time the baby woke up. This really hurt my feelings but I tried to move on. Eventually me n baby figured out our breastfeeding and it’s no longer painful. My husband still just hides under his pillow when I need help or am struggling at night. I have gotten to the point of extreme nausea and migraines due to the lack of sleep I get and had to beg my husband for a few hours of uninterrupted sleep once a week for my sanity. That didn’t last long but where he wakes up naturally at 5:30-6 am he decided he would take the baby if I would bring him out after my husband made coffee in the morning. (He starts every day with coffee and YouTube) 
This helped by allowing me an hour or two of sleep with out interruption. I was still really struggling to do the night shift completely alone. (He would often say “I’m awake every time you are” and that just made things worse. Knowing he was awake but was unwilling to help me made me feel so alone.) 

Fast forward to now - we are currently separated but are trying to figure things out. 
 A few nights ago I stayed at his place with our son and he was pretty inconsolable around 3 am. I asked my husband to take him for a little bit as I had been rocking him for 30ish minutes and was getting flustered. He said “for how long?” In a snarky tone. I brushed him off and just kept caring for our child as that response really hurt my feelings. Later that same night I said “I really need you to take him. I can’t keep doing this” and handed him the baby. Not even 5 minutes later he asked me in a very sarcastic tone “can you help please?!” And though that really pissed me off I took the baby and nursed him back to sleep. (I’m trying to lessen the night feeds hence rocking him to sleep instead) 
My husband didn’t say anything about this the next day and I went back home and just kept thinking about that. We are suppose to be growing better for eachother and are supposed to be putting in effort to be better parents and partners. 
This was two nights ago and I felt the need to get it off my chest and be honest. I told him today about how that made me feel and how when I’m alone I don’t have any other option than to put my baby in a safe space and walk away for a few minutes to compose myself before going back to take care of him alone. I told him how proud I am of myself for being able to do this alone for so long but that I really needed the help if we were together. 
He got super defensive and said that it was faster if I just “put him on the boob” rather than him help so I could have a break.

I was a “grab-what’s-cheap” kind of pizza person. But after spending a couple of years hunting down slices during late night walks, post-run hunger attacks, and more than a few “do I *need* to cook?” debates—I’ve developed opinions. 

This list is based on those. 

It’s not scientific, and I welcome strong disagreement (with suggestions, pls).

**Tier 1: Can’t Leave Halifax Without Eating This**

**1. Salvatore’s (Hydrostone)**

The crust. The sauce. The pep. The simplicity. 

Sal’s has been holding it down for decades and somehow still feels slept on by newcomers. I don’t care. I will die on this hill with a slice of The Maritimer in my hand. Elevated, chewy, with a smoky bite to the pepperoni (Chris Brothers, love it or hate it). It's also got a great meatball sub but that's for another post...

**2. Yeah Yeah’s Pizza (Dartmouth)**

Love me some Yeah, Yeahs. Especially when the pizza comes with a few left over crossciants from the coffee shop downstairs. It's slightly greasy in a comforting way, with that chewy-thin crust and proper leoparding on the bottom. Bonus: they tend to mix up the types and have different flavors on deck. 

**3. On The Wedge (Sunnyside Mall, Bedford)**

This spot caught me by surprise. Quirky, unexpected flavours. Sweet cornmeal crust. Apparently they had a peanut butter and jam pizza once upon a time. It feels like the closest thing Halifax has to a “gourmet slice shop.” If you’re a toppings person, this is your playground.

**4. Rinaldo’s (Dutch Village Rd)**

This place *gets* crust (I believe it's a spin off of Sal's?). I've been to Italy and they come the closest to what I've tried over there. Light pizza, a little chewy, a lot of crisp. It’s the spicy honey drizzle that makes the experience though. Game changer. Both Sal’s and Rinaldo’s make top 4 -- both delicious. My top two picks depending on the mood. Same family roots, different vibes

**5. Jacob’s Lounge (Dartmouth)**

It’s in a pub, yes. But it’s also serving low-key some of the best pizza downtown Dartmouth has. I've never ordered Jacob's Pizza for guests and have them leave not asking where we got it from. The pizza is unreal and it's one of the most surprising places in Halifax to have a great pizza (no offense). The wings are locallt legendary. Pizza is consistent (love their mediterranean). Underrated, unpretentious, and absolutely part of my go to pizza choices when people are visiting. 

**Tier: In The Rotation, No Notes**

**6. Tomavino’s (South End)**

One of the OGs. The pies are hefty, topping-heavy, and satisfyingly rich. They’ve been around forever and still deliver (literally and figuratively). Bonus: they’ll bring it to you at Garrison Brewing next door, which might be the best pizza + beer move in the city.

**7. Dominic’s Cucina (Food Truck)**

Easily the best Neapolitan-style pie in HRM. Wood-fired, fresh, and properly charred. Yes, it’s a food truck. Yes, that’s a bit inconvenient. But when you find them? Magic. The clam pizza gets love in the comments and honestly? It deserves it.

**8. Martha 2 Pizza (Bedford)**

Go in-person. Trust me. Takeout loses a bit of the crispness, but fresh from the oven? It’s the sleeper hit of Bedford.

**Tier: Style Points / Niche Cravings**

**9. Lou Pecou (Halifax)**

A southern French twist on Neapolitan pizza. Smaller pies, slightly different dough style. It’s refined, intimate, and definitely pricier—but a nice “treat yourself” pizza.

**10. Nayya Pizza (Sackville / Larry Uteck)**

For fans of that spicy brown sauce and Pictou County-style pies. Somewhere between gourmet and corner pizza. Garlic fingers are *also* elite. Not gonna lie though... If you don't like Pictou Style sauce - the pizza might not be fore you. 

**11. Ronnie’s Pizza**

I personally LOVED my pizza from Ronnie's but I saw they've recently had some meh reviews on Google. Not sure what's going on there **but** I will say - the price was right and the slices were delicious every time I got a pizza. Lots of toppings. They never skimped out on that. 

**12. Morris East (Vernon Street)**

Elegant. Thin crust. Great for a solo lunch or casual date. One of those places where you feel slightly more mature ordering pizza. I do feel like they've fallen off a bit though. Prices might have rose or something? It doesn't feel to me that it's what it once was...

**13. Piatto / Vesso**

Classic Neapolitan approach, and while opinions are *divided* post-name-change, it still gets props for its consistency and execution when they’re on their game. I think that Piatto (I mean Vesso) has the best crust in the city. I'm a sucker for Neapolitan.

The birds are chirping. We’re sitting on the patio of a dive bar I’ve taken over the touch tunes and in the background we’re listening to two old guys relive their glory days. One looks over and tells you your lady is “very pretty” you blush, I tell the gentleman that I’m not your lady. He takes this as an opportunity to cover my tab. He doesn’t know it covers us both - you’re welcome. After we finish off the 3rd pitcher of beer we ordered and make small talk with the bartender, I tell the old guy goodbye and we leave just in time to catch the hot dog cart outside. Since the tab was paid for us, I cover the dogs. I eat 3 and you stare in utter amazement how a girl so sweet and down to earth can guzzle a glizzy like that. I smile. We drunkenly kiss for a while and then we go our separate ways never to speak again. But every time you see a hot dog you think of me and that day we shared in late March. 

This could be us, but we probably don’t live in the same place, state, time zone or even country. But hey, wishful thinking and if we ever do meet, beer and a hot dog on me! 

I’m down to earth, easy going and I don’t stress the small stuff. I’m not looking for anything specific but if we can’t laugh together I don’t want it. I’m easy going and seeking someone who is as well. I’d prefer long term connection over short but we take what we can get! 

My interests/hobbies include but are not limited to: 

•Being creative: crafting, writing, trying a new medium and leaving projects undone. So many projects undone. 

•Watching sports: preferably the NFL & MLB. I like the 49ers and the Giants. Because just like my taste in men, my sports teams on occasion are good, and then they’re really bad most of the time. I also recently went to an NHL impeccable vibes. Still no clue what was happening. 

•Weight Lifting: I’m a strong girl, my goal this year is to leg press 1,000lbs and maybe read up on power lifting. Right now it’s strength focused with that one goal of leg press. I’ve found everyone likes stats so:  I squat 400, I can’t really bench press anymore  due to a shoulder injury (but I try) and my dead lift varies on how much I drank the day before. 

•Coffee/Beer/Wine: More so the experience of consuming these things. Trying new coffee shops on the weekend, beer and corn hole with friends on a Sunday afternoon, a wine bar and tapas for a change of pace in the evening. If someone’s pouring I’m drinking. 

•Concerts/Shows/Live Music: I have been to 200+. I have tickets to quite a few already this year and will probably get more. I love music and I love discovering music. You’ll find me at my local record store at least 3x a month. I will take over a TouchTunes at any bar and I will always play RHCP whether it’s the vibe or not. 

Here is me: https://imgur.com/a/rlvsryH. 5’6. Thick. Again lifts weights. Eats hot dogs. Yada yada. Would also love to see a photo of you eventually. I can’t get you hot dog and beer if I don’t know who you are. Attraction needs to be mutual. Lucky for you I enjoy all types. 

I don’t like video games or anime. You can have your hobby’s but these seem to be prevalent in a lot of people as personality traits. So hobby? Fine. Literally the only thing you do on the weekends? Not for me!

I am sharing this post as a tip to everyone so that you are aware of the current situation of things especially new users who doesn't have a clue. Here goes the list.. 

1.) They DON'T REFUND for OUT OF STOCK items paid by CASH VOUCHERS (lazada or shoppee). 
Their system only sees it as you are not maximizing the voucher value. YOUR LOSS = PROFIT TO THEM

Example buy 3 bottle of nescafe coffee but 1 bottle is out of stock. That out of stock is considered burn/forfeited from the original cash voucher and won't be refunded. Next time you want to order, make sure you go to the store and get confirmation from the store manager whether they have stock first before you order anything. 

2.) Customer service is non existent. 
Impossible to get live chat with live human agent. Suspect that all is running on AI chatbots which can spew scripted replies and close your ticket within 10 minutes or less. 

In the past, it is still possible to get a refund for 1.) because human agents are not mindless bots. 

3.) Facebook admin suspected to be a chatbot as well
The admin is always online and replies to your posts/comments with multiple language support and scripted replies very promptly. It is capable of deleting comments and also ban users who are CRITICAL about their services as well. In order words, your NEGATIVE posts on their Facebook would be deleted and you would be BANNED as a damage control if you continously comment on their poor services

4.) Reporting to KPDN / tribunal is not worth due to the small claim amount 
You still have to attend the tribunal hearing at their office and incur time cost by taking leave from work, parking, petrol, transport charges, etc. They know this so they would IGNORE KPDN threats from customers.

5.).... Feel free to continue from hereband add to this post about your BAD EXPERIENCE with them.

The objective is to remind everyone not to waste anymore time using their services as they wouldn't even care if you have to BEG them for REFUNDS or raise your blood pressures in doing so. In their perception, they have so much of customers that losing a few doesn't even make a dent in their profits.",4,1743301789.0,malaysia,5,1.0,False

We replaced all of the pulls with aged brass.

- paint color (I am leaning towards Swiss Coffee)
- vertical tile back splash, probably green, debating navy 
- lighting changes 
- kitchen runners 
- anything else

1jn2jo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jn2jo3/know_your_muslim_friend/,Know Your Muslim Friend,"Day 1:
 The First Glimpse He sat alone that night, the television humming with headlines. ""Terrorist Attack,"" the screenflashed, once again.The face of a man with a beard filled the frame, another so-called Muslim with violence in his eyes.He turned the TV off,sighed, and stared at the ceiling. He didn't know any Muslims personally. But he felt like he knewthem through the media.That night, when he closed his eyes, the dream was dark. Streets filled with chaos. Crowds chantingin languages he didn't understand.Explosions. Sirens. A flag he didn't recognize waving high. He woke up sweating.He sat up, trying to slow his breathing. It was 3:18 a.m. He tried to go back to sleep but couldn't.He threw on his shoes and went for a walk around the empty block. Cold air bit his face, but heneeded it.

Day 2: 
Masks and MarchesAnother dream. This time, masked men marched in his neighborhood, all shouting foreign phrases.His neighbors had vanished.In their place were strangers with black uniforms. No smiles. No peace. Just fear.He woke up again. 2:49 a.m. This time, he stayed sitting in bed. He stared at the wall. He rubbed histemples and asked himself, ""Why am I seeing this?""



Day 3: 
The Black FlagIn the dream, the country had changed. The Union Jack was gone, replaced by a black flag.Churches were closed. Christmas lights outlawed.He ran through streets looking for help, but everyone had changed. Even the children spoke inwhispers.He woke up in sweat again. 4:03 a.m. He paced the living room barefoot. He opened the fridge,drank straight from a bottle of water, and sat staring out the window.

Day 4: 
Lost StreetsHe walked the streets of London but nothing felt familiar. The cafes were gone. Arabic signseverywhere. Women covered head to toe, men glaring in silence.He heard the Adhan echoing. But instead of peace, his dream painted it as a warning.He woke up groaning. His head was heavy. 3:11 a.m. He didn't even try to sleep again. He just laidon the couch, eyes open until sunrise.

Day 5: 
Forced ConversionHe stood in a long line. A man yelled, ""Convert or leave."" He looked behind him-his family trembling.He opened his mouth to speak but couldn't.He raised his hands, and someone put a book in them. It burned.He woke up gasping. 2:25 a.m. This time, he sat in the kitchen. He scrolled through his phone,trying to distract himself. Nothing helped.

Day 6: 
Nuclear ThreatIn this dream, maps lit up with red zones. Pakistan launched warheads. Turkey followed. Dubai,Iran, Syria-each country with buttons and threats.London was a target. He watched the sky rain fire.He woke with tears in his eyes. 3:44 a.m. He sat in the shower with cold water running. He didn'teven feel it.

Day 7:
 Friends TurnedHe sat in a café with old friends. They smiled, then suddenly stood, pulling off their coats to revealexplosives. They whispered ""This is the end.""He screamed, but no one heard.He woke up screaming. 1:52 a.m. His neighbor knocked on the door, asking if he was okay. He saidyes, but he wasn't.

Day 8:
 The Fall of BordersIn this vision, all of Europe fell. Borders collapsed. Soldiers marched, not with national flags, butunder one symbol. The world turned brown, black, and grey.No color. No culture. No past.He woke up cold. 4:27 a.m. He curled up in bed, trying to remember something good. But his brainwas exhausted.

Day 9: 
The Last ChurchHe ran to find his old church, only to see it being demolished, brick by brick. A man stood where thecross used to be and said, ""This is no longer needed.""He woke with tears in his eyes.4:00 a.m. He looked at an old photo of his family on Christmas morning. He felt something insidehim shaking loose.

Day 10: 
The MirrorHe looked into a mirror in the dream. His own face wore a beard and a foreign robe. He tried tospeak, but the voice that came out was in Arabic.He was no longer himself.
He woke up shaking. That was the last straw.Each night had left him weaker. He had barely slept. His eyes had dark circles. He avoided his ownreflection.He couldn't keep living in this cycle of fear.He needed to know the truth.The Journey BeginsHe opened his laptop. Not for the news. For answers.He typed: ""What does Islam really teach?""The pages were endless. But the more he read, the more he realized:- Islam wasn't what the media showed.- The Qur'an spoke of peace, discipline, respect.- Muslims weren't a monolith of hate. They were mothers, fathers, neighbors, teachers.He started walking past the mosque with softer eyes. He began nodding at the hijabi girl on the bus.He smiled at the man with the beard in the coffee shop.He visited his Muslim neighbor-Mr. Khan. They had tea. They talked. And for the first time, helistened.The Vision: Know Your Muslim FriendHe had an idea. Something different. Something real.A café. But not just for coffee. For connection.No alcohol. No loud music. Just honest conversation.He called it: ""Know Your Muslim Friend""He shared the idea with his two closest friends. At first, they were hesitant. But over longconversations, coffee, and debates,they too began to see the importance of a space built on understanding instead of assumption.He opened it in the city center. A small, cozy place with books on Islam, cups of mint tea, and warmcushions.A question box sat in the corner. And above the door, it read:""Enter with curiosity. Leave with clarity.""

Part 2 

Day 1
 of the CaféA young man walked in, skeptical. He asked, ""Why do Muslims pray five times a day?""A Muslim woman answered with a smile, ""To stay connected with the Creator.""They spoke for hours.

Day 5
An old war veteran sat with a refugee. They shared stories. Both cried.

Day 12
An atheist teen asked, ""Do you hate me because I don't believe?""A Muslim man replied, ""My job is not to judge. My job is to treat you kindly.""

Day 20
Friendships were forming. Conversations replaced assumptions.The fear that once ruled his heart was melting.People came in searching for answers. Some with doubt, others with anger.But every time, he listened. He guided them. Sometimes he didn't have all the answers, but healways made sure someone was there who did.Each night, he returned home with less weight on his shoulders. No more nightmares.Just peace.Final Dream: One Land, One PeaceOne night, weeks after the café opened, he slept peacefully.And he dreamed.He saw the UK.He saw Israel.He saw Palestine.No walls. No war. No fear.One country.One people.Children playing together.No checkpoints.No tanks.Just olive trees. Laughter. Peace.He woke up with tears in his eyes.Not of fear.But of hope.

Mine is when I went to Colombia last October with my two never-mo friends. On General Conference Sunday (because I still always know when it is lmao) we toured a coffee plantation in Medellín, Colombia. We got to taste test many varieties of coffee, drink a coffee tea (double whammy!) made from the fruity outer shells of coffee beans, explore the plantation to gather our own coffee beans, and learn how coffee is made. It was a beautiful day which my friends and I agree was the past part of the trip. The whole time I was there I couldn’t help but think how I would never have been able to do this incredible day trip if I were still Mormon and how freeing it is to do whatever tf I want without fear of divine or institutional retribution. (Later that day Rusty announced a new temple in Medellín; good luck finding a  decent spot lmao).

By day, I delivered pizza across the backroads and neighborhoods of Saginaw, Texas. But during those long, winding drives, I wasn’t alone. I had a voice riding shotgun—Russ Martin. 105.3 FM. Loud, unapologetic, often insane. His radio show was a lifeline, a chaotic current in the background of my life.

It was 2002 when things took a turn.

Russ was hyping up the one- or maybe two-year anniversary bash for 105.3—this massive blowout planned for the Ennis Speedway. VIP tickets were going for $105.30, a clever nod to the frequency. But then… Russ said something that made me freeze, controller in hand, mid-race in Wipeout on my PS2.

“If anyone brings me a live goat in a schoolgirl outfit,” he said, “or a live chicken in a G-string, with lipstick on its beak—I’ll give you a pair of VIP tickets. Free.”

My friend Big Daddy—yes, Big Daddy—was sprawled on the couch behind me, eating a fistful of off-brand corn chips. We lived together in a rundown rental that always smelled like wet carpet and pizza grease.

I paused the game. The radio hummed in the background like it was daring me.

I turned slowly to Big Daddy and said the words that would mark the beginning of a very slippery slope:

“Big Daddy… how much do you think a live chicken costs?”

He didn’t even blink. “Depends,” he said. “You want a fat one?”

Right then, something shifted in the room. The air got heavy. Like destiny had entered the chat.

Because we weren’t joking. Not really.

We were thinking.

Plotting.

The internet was slow back then—dial-up slow—so we were on our own. No YouTube tutorials. No Etsy for chicken lingerie. Just two idiots with a dream and a rapidly unraveling moral compass.

Within the hour, we were in my busted Corolla, heading toward the edge of town, chasing rumors about a guy who sold livestock out of the back of his property. We didn’t even have a plan for how to explain why we needed a chicken, much less how we were going to apply lipstick to a beak.

But one thing was certain:

Russ Martin had thrown down the gauntlet.

And we were picking it up.

The man who sold us the chicken didn’t ask many questions.

Just grunted, took our cash, and pointed to a wire cage where half a dozen birds clucked aimlessly in the dirt. We chose one that looked cooperative—or at least, not actively hostile. Got it into a pet carrier with only minor bloodshed. Ours, not the bird’s.

Mission Part One: Acquire chicken — complete.

Then came Part Two: Outfit the chicken.

We drove straight to the only place open late that carried the kind of depravity we needed—a dingy sex shop tucked between a payday loan office and an abandoned laundromat. This place had everything: racks of DVDs nobody admitted to owning, suspiciously sticky shelves of toys, and a wall of blow-up dolls with faces frozen in horror.

We asked the clerk for the smallest, skimpiest G-string they had. He raised an eyebrow, gave us a once-over, and didn’t ask a single question. Just led us to a rack near the back, where we found a tiny scrap of lace and elastic that barely qualified as clothing.

It was perfect.

Mission Part Two: Chicken lingerie — secured.

Next stop: the dollar store. We needed lipstick. Not just any lipstick—we needed the loudest, most promiscuous shade available. The kind of red that screamed “I make bad decisions and I’m proud of them.”

We found it.

One dollar.

The packaging actually said “Hot Tamale #69.”

Back at the house, we set the pet carrier on the table and laid out our tools like we were prepping for surgery. The G-string. The lipstick. The bird. The clock was ticking. We needed to present this chicken in all of it's accoutrment to the Russ Martin Show the next day if we wanted to get these tickets.

But we were missing something.

Not something—someone.

We looked at each other. Same thought.

Big Steve.

We needed a third man. Someone with the right balance of unshakable calm and just enough bad judgment to join a plan this deranged without hesitation. And Steve… Steve had that energy.

I picked up the phone.

He answered on the second ring.

“You guys up to something?” he asked, not even a hello.

I said, “We need your help. It involves a live chicken, a G-string, and lipstick.”

He paused. Then said:

“…What time?.”

The next day began like any other—except we were hungover, disoriented, and about to smuggle a half-naked chicken into a radio station.

I woke up to the kind of headache that feels like your skull is caving in from the inside. The room spun. My mouth felt like I’d licked a shag carpet soaked in whiskey.

But then I remembered.

Today was the day.

3:00 p.m. sharp, the Russ Martin Show would go live—with a full studio audience. It was Friday, and Fridays were loud, chaotic, and full of moments that became legend in DFW radio history.

I staggered down the hall and pounded on Big Daddy’s door.

“Wake up,” I said through the haze. “Today’s the day.”

No hesitation. He opened the door immediately, eyes bloodshot but locked in.

“I know,” he said. “Let’s do this.”

We got to work dressing our accomplice—Henrietta. That’s what we’d decided to call her. It struck the right tone: classy, a little vintage, and just ridiculous enough to carry a G-string with dignity.

The operation was delicate. Chickens are not known for their patience or style sense. It took two of us to gently strap the scandalous little thing into her new black lace wardrobe. Then came the lipstick. Hot Tamale #69. Big Daddy held her steady while I applied it like we were prepping her for a red carpet.

She looked like she belonged on a Vegas marquee.

We popped her into the pet carrier, gave her a few calming words, then jumped into the car to grab our third man—Big Steve.

Steve climbed in with a smirk, took one look at Henrietta, nodded, and said, “She’s ready.”

And just like that, we were off—three men and one glam-rock chicken in a Corolla barreling toward destiny. From Fort Worth to Dallas, the highway hummed beneath us, nerves growing with each mile.

We pulled into the parking lot of a towering 23-story office building—the headquarters of 105.3 FM.

We were here.

We strutted through the glass front doors like men on a mission, Henrietta swaying in her carrier like a silent co-conspirator. The lobby was all business suits, polished marble, and echoes of clacking heels. We didn’t belong—but we didn’t care.

We stepped into the elevator and hit 14—the floor we thought housed the Russ Martin studio.

The elevator dinged.

The doors opened.

And we stepped out… directly into hell.

It wasn’t the studio.

It was the building manager’s office.

A massive floor, Scarface-style—leather furniture, floor-to-ceiling windows, and at the center of it all, a desk. Behind it sat a woman who looked like she had been forged from scowls and expired coffee.

She narrowed her eyes the second she saw us.

Then she shrieked, “What is that in your hands?!”

Big Daddy held up the carrier. “It’s a chicken,” he said cheerfully. “For Russ!”

She was not amused.

“This is a professional building,” she snapped. “You can’t just bring livestock in here! Get out! NOW!”

And with that, she began physically escorting us back toward the elevator. Henrietta clucked in protest.

That was it. The dream was dying in a whimper of feathers and shame.

But fate wasn’t done with us yet.

Halfway down—the elevator stopped.

The doors opened…

And in stepped Eddie Boyd, program director of the Russ Martin Show.

He looked at us.

He looked at the chicken.

He blinked.

“…What the hell do you boys have there?” he asked.

We told him, in glorious, overlapping panic:

“It’s the chicken! The one Russ said he’d give VIP tickets for! She’s got the G-string! The lipstick! She’s ready!”

He looked like he wanted to laugh but didn’t quite know if he should.

Then he said, “Listen. We can’t let you bring her up. Not through the lobby. Not like this. But go outside. Listen to the show. We’ll figure it out. Call us.”

The elevator doors closed.

We stood there in the lobby, hearts pounding, chicken softly clucking in her little satin prison.

We weren’t done yet.

Not by a long shot.

We were escorted out the front doors like criminals. Henrietta clucked softly in her carrier, unaware she was now a fugitive.

Back at the car, Big Steve pulled out his phone and called the studio. “We’re not leaving,” he said. “This chicken’s getting her fifteen minutes of fame, or we die trying.”

A few minutes later, a man from the station approached with a shipping box.

“You guys the ones with the chicken?”

“Yes, sir.”

“I’m gonna smuggle her in,” he said. “They really want her inside.”

We loaded Henrietta into the box. He turned and marched toward the building like a soldier on a mission.

Five minutes later, he returned—shaking his head.

“Security’s on high alert. They’ve got someone at every entrance. They're checking every package now. We’re not getting her in.”

Meanwhile, we had the show blasting through the car radio. They were talking about us. The whole segment was about how to smuggle a chicken in lingerie into the building.

We weren’t just part of the show anymore. We were the show.

That’s when we saw it.

A UPS truck, parked in the back of the building near a dimly lit stairwell. No security. No suits. Just a back door… slightly ajar.

We looked at each other.

“Go.”

We left the car running, grabbed Henrietta, and sprinted—three grown men with a chicken in lingerie, ducking behind a brown truck like we were planning a heist.

After ten long minutes of waiting, the back door opened.

We moved fast.

Flight after flight of stairs. Sweating, gasping, Henrietta rattling in her carrier as we climbed. Four floors. Seven. Ten. Fourteen.

We burst through the final door.

And there it was.

The Russ Martin Studio.

And they were live.

We didn’t hesitate.

We marched into that studio like war heroes, crashing into the broadcast mid-show. The audience erupted. Laughter. Cheers. Applause. We were drenched in sweat, out of breath, and clutching a chicken in stripperwear.

We. Fucking. Made it.

The entire staff took photos with Henrietta. Russ laughed so hard he nearly cried. They gave us the VIP tickets on the spot, clapped us on the back, and called us legends.

We basked in that glory. That bizarre, feather-filled glory.

And when the excitement died down, I turned to Russ and asked:

“Hey, uh… can we take the elevator down this time?”

He grinned. “Of course, boys. And please—feel free to show off your chicken to security on your way down!.”


---

Three guys. One chicken. A dream made real.

Radio history was written that day.

And her name… was Henrietta.


This happened on 06-21-2002, and begins at the 40 minute mark. This was one of the funniest days of my life. Lol

Where should we start our family?,"Just as the title suggests my soon to be wife, wants to move on from the life we’re currently living in small town Ohio (Cleveland ish area). I’m a little hesitant to do so, as I’ve moved a bit more than she has, and I got my house at a great rate a few years back. However, I can’t deny I would like to experience something new again. So here goes nothing. 

Our combined income is in the area of 140k and we both have very universal jobs (law enforcement, and healthcare clerical work.) 

I would like to be at maximum, a 12 hour drive away from the Cleveland area as my parents are aging and don’t want to be far from them. But would be a little flexible on this if the perfect fit is a bit outside that. 

A little area to breathe, ideally 45 to an hour outside of a city, so we can still get the culture of a city without being packed in with neighbors. 

She loves going to ma and Pa coffee shops, so that would be nice. 

She’s also 6 months pregnant with our first child, so it goes without saying we would like the place to be safe with more of a family population. 

We’re a purple couple (I’m conservative, she’s liberal) so somewhere with some balance so one of us doesn’t feel alienated.

It's the first walk I've taken in a while; I was out of town the week before last, and this past week I was in the office way too much. I've never experienced a Seattle spring since I'm new to the city ( moved from Austin in September) and on this innocuous walk I realized that I had long since forgotten that spring is supposed to smell like flowers and that beautiful natural perfume and life. This might sound dramatic but in Austin you don't really get a spring. There's some mild weather, and then a whole lot of pollen, and then you sear for the next 6 months. Also the neighborhoods in 90% of the city don't have flowers at all. I seriously forgot that flowers growing around have a smell that you can actually smell.

  
But on this simple little walk to the store, I saw so many varieties of flowers from tulips to jasmine to beautiful flowering trees, and I saw that so many people in the neighborhood had planted flowers even on the patches of grass that aren't part of their front yard. Just flowers everywhere. I was really just astounded and it was so wonderful and restorative after a long week.  


I feel so privileged that on such a simple walk I get to walk amongst such bountiful and beautiful nature. I'm really grateful to live here.

From neighbor to neighbor, if you have some time come to First Hill and take a nice walk. You can get a great cup of coffee from Drip Drip Coffeehouse or Peloton Cafe and enjoy the spring flowers :)",14,1743300698.0,Seattle,1,0.94,False

So my girlfriend (19F) and I (21M) have been in a relationship for over a year now. Our whole relationship has not been perfect, as I assume most relationships are not, but recently I have been very mixed on whether or not it's still worth it to keep going or have I not been doing enough?

It's lately been very difficult for me, and I feel as if it has been dragging me down and impacting my mental health in ways that I've never been affected before. I've done my absolute best to love her and I don't know if there's anything more that I can do. I will break this down into several sections to simplify this as best as I can.

She absolutely doesn't want me talking to my friends about things even if the issues have been really taking a toll on me. When fights become so frequent, it just really drains you, but I feel like I'm not allowed to talk to my friends about it and she claims it's because ""it's none of their business"". I know how she is and even if she says she'd prefer that I spoke to her about it, everytime i do i feel so guilty because I know it hurts so much for her to hear it, but she doesn't want me to talk about it with anyone else.

She has abandonment issues and has suicidal thoughts, and has had numerous suicide attempts that she thankfully survived and recovered from over the course of this relationship. Her most recent suicide attempt was literally just 2-3 days ago, about a few days separate from her last LAST attempt. She's currently under surveillance via cameras in her room as ordered by her Psych Ward / Hospital, and she takes daily therapy and is going to also receive another proficient therapist to help her.

My friends have absolutely started to notice how different I've been acting and they've all been really worried.

I know that fights happen in relationships, and I will try to describe some of the recent fights that we've had:

* I am currently a college student, and one of my classes is a Bioscience class for this semester. There are more female students than male students in this class. I recently finished an exam, and was the first to walk out. I called her and told her the news and she was pretty happy and proud! It was 10am and we had to return by 11am to the room for another review for an upcoming exam the next week as well. The next three classmates of mine who finished and walked out to where I was are all female. One of which is a LESBIAN girl who I view as a genuine friend, and she has a crush on another girl in campus. The other two girls are people I literally just met in the semester, and they're really chill people. We all agreed to just get some coffee, so I texted her that we were just going to go get some Boba from a nearby cafe, and i left the discord call we were in where one of our other friends were there, and she was very upset about it, spamming my messages and texting me not to leave and to please come back, and she persisted even when I said my phone was already halfway to dying (It reached that because I also stay on call with her every morning on the drive to campus, and text/call her too when i get out of class), spamming things such as  ""pleaseeee"" ""please come back"" and the like. and ""where are you going?!"" I reminded her that I was going to the Boba store and she texted me wtf why and what am i doing. I reminded her that we still had an hour before we had to go back to class as she mistakenly thought I could just go home. She asked me why did I even message her if I didn't plan on going home, and I just told her I wanted to say hi and check up on her. She then said ""You still have so much time (referring to me still having an hour of time).."" and ""What are you hiding?"" I had to literally tell her I wasn't hiding anything at all.
* She absolutely doesn't trust ANY girl near me. Remember I talked about a friend who's literally a lesbian girl, and she still didn't trust her because she told me ""I was lesbian too, until I met YOU."" I tried to remind her that she is not her and they are not the same person, but she didn't seem to care. She once got home from her therapy and I ask how she's doing, and she says she's doing good. The first thing she then notices is my Discord Status set to ""Jump Up, Super Star!"" which is the reference to the Super Mario Odyssey song, sung by a female character named Pauline. When I told her it was just a mario song, she said ""Ugh, the song sung by that one GIRL?"" (For simplifying it: She's gotten jealous also over the fact that some of the songs I've put on my status were sung by girls, even fictional characters.)
* There was another instance in campus: For context, art students at my college love to draw each other and our friends as a fun time-killer activity. I did this with a friend of mine and she went absolutely ballistic, stating things like ""Why are you drawing another girl and not me?"" I've already drawn her (my girlfriend) several times throughout our relationship as gifts, and this was nothing more than a fun activity to do with a friend who also likes art, and nothing more than that at all. She got incredibly stressed out and was losing it to the point of spamming my messages to get her message across via individual words. I realized it was yet another fight, and my other friends around the table (yes there were other people too) started to notice I was suddenly just down in terms of mood and had to check up on me. I wanted to open up and I knew it would help if I did but I didn't out of respect for her not liking me talking about it with other people, even my closest friend.
* Regarding the friend of mine I drew above: My girlfriend said I only seemingly hang around girls (which I don't. There's just more girls than guys in my class, but I absolutely don't hang out with girls more than guys.) so I reminded her that the friend I drew was the only girl at that table. She called the said person I drew as ""weird"" for being the only girl around in a table full of guys. (The girl she said was weird is absolutely chill and just met all these people except for one mutual friend of ours (male) at the table.)
* At the end of our fights, even if I didn't start them, I am still somehow asked to say sorry and I feel as if the entire thing was my fault. I understand that there may be things that I could've helped with and those I will absolutely apologize for, but I just get so tired with having to take the responsibility of apologizing or taking the blame for a mess I didn't even start. IN FACT, Many of our fights happened but I didn't even do anything or say anything at all that can possibly be something that can trigger or spark a heated conversation at the very least, but they still happen, and it's been really stressing me out.
* I was in a private Discord call with a close friend, he wanted to show me something on his video game. She then asks where I am and I tell her im in call with this friend. She then tells me ""Why don't you both just go into vc"" and I answered well it's because we're already here and he just called me to show me something. When she realized I wasn't going into our server's voice channel, she started to spam me and spam me and of course it brought me down. She also was repeatedly nagging me to play a game with her, but I just wasn't feeling it cause I was really just feeling stressed from yet another fight that happened just minutes prior. She started to cry and say she was too much. Eventually she accepted and I just felt really exhausted at this point.

When i try to talk about issues:

* As recently stated, she doesn't permit me to talk about problems to my friends, and even my one closest friend who is always unbiased and gives solid, firm advice. I understand the part because it's OUR relationship, but I believe in how helpful it can be to get a third party perspective because I do believe we're going to be biased towards ourselves.
* She states that I am allowed to talk about it with her or to rant about anything, but when I do rant she always cuts in and always tries to defend herself midway which completely breaks my train of thought. All I wanted was for someone to listen, but it HAS to be her because I can't talk to anyone else about it.
* When I feel a certain way, it will really reflect on how I'm feeling. When I feel stressed out or down, I tend to really sound like it, but she does not like it when I sound that way after a fight or she doesn't like it when I display it in front of people, even to those who know me. She just texted me a few hours ago ""Don't bring stuff like that into the call. That damn tone, don't bring that. Next time, don't act like that in public."" saying that I didn't have to ruin the mood and make it awkward. Note that we had a fight in text while in call with our friends because I just told her I didn't want to play a certain game with her (VRCHAT) because I just wasn't feeling comfortable and in the mood for it.

I've honestly been afraid to be real honest with how this relationship has been eating up at me, but I'm afraid because I don't want her to hurt herself or to god forbid, kill herself.. But I can't talk to her and I can't talk to my friends about anything, I'm really feeling like I'm forced to hold my feelings in. I know for a fact internally I want to leave it but at the same time I don't for our friends. None of our mutual friends know at all about any of this that's been going on behind the curtains of our relationship.

TL;DR: Drained from relationship due to unfair treatment and unnecessary fights, but I don't know if it's right to break up or not. I don't start the fights and don't try to at all but I'm made to feel like I did something wrong, She hates any girl that comes near me. She's had a two suicide attempts in the past two weeks which make me so hesitant on making a decision whether I should break it or push through. A lot of these situations are under a week old.

While kratom is sometimes misunderstood, it has potential benefits, especially for those seeking an alternative to traditional painkillers or stimulants. Let’s compare them in detail:

# 1. Source & Composition

* **Kratom**: Derived from the leaves of *Mitragyna speciosa*, a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It contains **mitragynine** and **7-hydroxymitragynine**, which interact with opioid receptors but also have stimulant-like effects.
* **Coffee**: Comes from roasted coffee beans (seeds of *Coffea* plants) and contains **caffeine**, a well-known stimulant.
* **Opioids**: A broad category of natural (morphine, codeine), semi-synthetic (oxycodone, hydrocodone), and synthetic (fentanyl, methadone) painkillers that bind strongly to opioid receptors.

# 2. Effects on the Body

|Feature|Kratom|Coffee|Opioids|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Primary Effect**|Stimulant at low doses, sedative at high doses|Stimulant|Pain relief, euphoria, sedation|
|**Mechanism of Action**|Partial opioid receptor agonist & adrenergic effects|Adenosine receptor antagonist (blocks drowsiness)|Full opioid receptor agonist|
|**Energy & Focus**|Boosts energy at low doses|Increases alertness|Decreases (except in euphoria-driven motivation)|
|**Pain Relief**|Mild to strong, depending on strain & dose|No significant analgesic effect|Strong pain relief|
|**Euphoria & Mood Enhancement**|Moderate, often described as mild well-being|Minimal|High|
|**Addiction Potential**|Lower than opioids, but moderate|Low|High|
|**Withdrawal Symptoms**|Manageable, flu-like symptoms|Fatigue, headaches|Severe (pain, cravings, nausea)|

# Kratom’s Unique Advantage: Unlike traditional opioids, kratom provides pain relief and relaxation without severe respiratory depression, making it much safer in that regard.

# 3. Medical & Everyday Use

* **Kratom**: Traditionally used in Southeast Asia to **increase energy, relieve pain, and promote well-being**. In modern use, it’s often taken to **manage pain, improve mood, and ease opioid withdrawal symptoms**. Some also use it as a natural alternative for mild anxiety or focus enhancement.
* **Coffee**: Primarily used to **boost energy, alertness, and concentration**. It’s a common part of daily routines worldwide.
* **Opioids**: Prescribed for **moderate to severe pain relief**, often in post-surgical care, cancer treatment, or chronic pain conditions. However, they come with a high addiction risk.

# 4. Risks & Side Effects

|Side Effect|Kratom|Coffee|Opioids|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Nausea**|Common at high doses|Mild at high doses|Common|
|**Drowsiness**|Only at higher doses|Rare|Very common|
|**Addiction Risk**|Moderate (less than opioids, more than coffee)|Low|High|
|**Respiratory Depression**|Uncommon|No|High risk (can be fatal)|
|**Heart Effects**|May raise heart rate in some people|Increases heart rate & blood pressure|Can lower heart rate|
|**Tolerance**|Develops over time but slower than opioids|Mild tolerance buildup|Rapid tolerance buildup|
|**Withdrawal**|Flu-like symptoms, mild cravings|Headaches, fatigue|Severe cravings, pain, sweating|

# Kratom’s Unique Advantage: Many people report that kratom withdrawal is far milder than opioid withdrawal and that it can be used as a bridge for those trying to taper off addictive pain medications.

# 5. Legality & Regulation

* **Kratom**: Legal in some areas but restricted in others due to safety concerns. The U.S. FDA has not classified it as a controlled substance, though some states regulate it. Ongoing research could lead to clearer policies.
* **Coffee**: Completely legal worldwide, with no major regulatory concerns.
* **Opioids**: Highly regulated due to their addictive nature and overdose potential. Prescription-only in most places.

# 6. Overdose & Safety

* **Kratom**: Overdose is rare, and it does **not cause fatal respiratory depression** like opioids. However, very high doses can cause nausea, dizziness, or sedation.
* **Coffee**: Can cause **caffeine toxicity** in extreme amounts, leading to heart palpitations and anxiety. Fatal overdoses are extremely rare.
* **Opioids**: High risk of overdose due to **respiratory depression**, especially with potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl.

# Kratom’s Unique Advantage: Unlike opioids, kratom does not shut down breathing, making it a much safer alternative for pain relief and relaxation.

# 7. Overall Summary

* **Coffee** is great for energy and focus with little downside.
* **Kratom** is a **natural alternative for pain relief and mood enhancement** with lower addiction risk than opioids. It also has stimulant-like effects at low doses.
* **Opioids** are extremely effective for pain but come with high risks, including addiction and overdose.

# Bottom Line:

Kratom is not without risks, but it offers **a middle ground between coffee and opioids**—providing **energy, pain relief, and mood support** without the extreme dangers of opioid addiction. More research is needed, but many users find it beneficial for **pain management, motivation, and even opioid withdrawal support**.

Hi! I’ve suddenly come to the realisation that my symptoms may be adhd, however I have always been extremely good at hiding my symptoms which is why I may have never been diagnosed. My sister and dad both are diagnosed, however, I see there signs of hyperactivity more.

For me, my brain is constantly going a million miles which means even the smallest task will overwhelm me. This makes it difficult to make any decisions, leading to impulse decisions or a breakdown from being so emotional over it.

I’m always in a rush - yet have no where to be. I struggle to manage my irritability when someone doesn’t match my speed or changes plans on me. I’m also contanstly misplacing my belongings because I’m so rushed. I’m not highly energetic but I always have to be moving or doing something.

I’m constantly hyperfixed on things, and always need a stimulant whether that be coffee, food, alcohol and drugs. (Alcohol and drug usage is high within my family).

I’m obsessed with how I come across in social settings, leading me not to socialise. I’m not that hygienic (won’t wash my hands, bite my nails and pick my nose). I love my partner but find sex a time waster so I don’t enjoy it. I can never be present (without something to stimulate me).

I’ve never actually admitted these things out loud before. May these be symptoms or am I just a little be crazy?

We are almost 6 months apart, and it hurts sometimes more sometimes less.
But whatever I am going through, I know it has been more painful to you to deal with acute (or chronic) ckd, and your resilience is something I will admire, and be ashamed I could not read the signs.

Tomorrow is Sunday, our day to be lazy and get to sleep in majority of the day.

At exactly 13 PM you leave the balcony where you either soak in the sun, or try to call neighbor cat to play, or just mess around with my mom to open and close the door. Yes that door with the mosqito protection where you made a hole 😂

I am a long sleeper and my favorite thing is to drink coffee and eat breakfast and go out with you. 
Outside is our terriotory as much as it is in our home. House which you made a home. House full of laughter. House that shifted energy from a lot of losses to a space where all we could talk about is you. House that felt right only when it is four of us. House that is now hollow wothout your bark, and we would give our all just to hear it again. Nevermind the neighbors. They got used to it. They love you as well. I never cared, personally.

So you would sprint to our room, bark, ocupy my attention, bark when I put on my socks, thinking they are yours and we would storm in the park.

We would play for hour, usually even more. 
Just fetching whatever we can find- sticks, tennis balls, squeaky balls, new balls, old balls, all of those cute toys you stole from kids,your dinosaur, your giraffe... 
 
Just looking at how fast and accurate you are was a feast, not only to me, but to all of the bypassers. You are a star, and you knew it, and your status was established from the moment I brought you there. I just enjoyed and I am so proud you are mine. So athletic, with such a personality, very rough on the outside but the softest soul on the inside. 

After the park, we would cool down a bit and I would take you in my arms. I k ew you are tired, but I also enjoyed it. Started that as a ritual because you would not leave the park even if I called you. 
You love outdoors so much I joked that I would be happiest to live in a trailer inside of the park, so that you can run first thing in the morning. 

Then after taking you kissing you, hugging you and just carrying you around like a baby which I definitely felt like, we would go home for a lunch.
After lunch, we would nap together. You on my leg, or one next to each other, or you curled up with me.
Seeing your face after the nap, waking me up woth kisses and just playing fetch is a blessing.
I could have never gotten better companion than you. 
We are the same. I always felt like you are my other half but in doggy world.

We would go out again, around 9pm, same park, same routine, but with a ball that is glowing in the dark, hide and seek, just pushing me to get more creative, to come up with new games, to build more anticipation when I throw the ball, to make it fun with my boyfriend.
Even playing basketball on the court, where you would bring every ball to us. 

After the park, again in my arms, and announcing we would go to a bar. That was the highlight of the day, where you would get your own water in a paper cup, and protect us from the guests, and always cuddle with the bartenders knowing that they are giving drinks😂 watching people straight in their eyes when they pass, and looking for a cuddle, was just the sign for me we managed to regain the faith which you had in humans. 

And all of my dreams which I was not even aware is possible, like places for dogs on the seaside, more adventures planned, more big life decisions which were made easy just with you there, all of my desires... Just dissapeared on that 15th of october, until 18th.

But this post is not about me, this post is about you. 
What you tried to overcome, how stoic you are, how much dignity and grace you showed, how much of a fighter you are until the very end, and all of the lessons we may not understand even after all this time. 

And in front of you I feel so small. So small and undeserving of your love, your presence and our fight. 

I just hope you are now good and that you will be able to forgive me one day. 

In my every life, I would always choose you. 

I hooe this is not the end. 

Love you to the end of universe and back

She'll take coffee over tea.

She does things thought impossible,

She raised us all and by herself,

Just so that she knows,

Mama, girl I love you,

And every day, that love just grows. 


For all of my rollercoaster life,

You have been my strong backbone. 

Thankyou for every single thing,

And never leaving me alone.

1jn1rwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1jn1rwk/34_m4f_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection/,34 [M4F] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",2,1743298581.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* Due to my personality and desires, I could be considered part of the ace/aro spectrum. **I am demisexual and demiromantic IRL. I am prone to graysexuality online** due to it not requiring actual physical touch. I get along very well with people across this spectrum despite having sexual desires myself. If nothing else, we can have amazing conversations.
* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1743298574.0,r4rAsexual,0,1.0,False

1jn1qip,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jn1qip/one_year_caffeinefree_my_journey_why_ill_never_go/,One Year Caffeine-Free: My Journey & Why I’ll Never Go Back,"Exactly one year ago today, I quit caffeine. For over a decade, I was drinking 5–6 cups of coffee a day plus 1–2 sodas, totaling roughly 600–800mg of caffeine daily. But despite consuming that much, I still felt tired. Caffeine wasn’t giving me energy anymore it was just preventing withdrawal symptoms.  

At 18, caffeine gave me a boost. By 30, it was just a crutch. The only thing coffee did for me was stop headaches. I realized I wasn’t getting anything positive out of it anymore, so I decided to quit.  

How I Quit Without Going Cold Turkey:

I took a gradual tapering approach instead of quitting all at once:  
✅ Step 1: Cut out soda first and replaced it with seltzer water and more filtered tap water.  
✅ Step 2: Reduced coffee by one cup per week (~90mg caffeine per week).  
✅ Step 3: Transitioned from coffee to black tea, then to green tea, then herbal tea.  
✅ Step 4: Eventually, I stopped drinking tea altogether and now only drink water.  

This slow transition prevented withdrawal while tapering, but once I hit zero caffeine, I got hit hard.  

Withdrawal Symptoms Were Different Than Expected:

I expected the usual headaches, but I wasn’t prepared for:  
🔹 Icepick headaches and general headaches that lasted days.  
🔹 Flu-like body aches that made me feel sick.  
🔹 Extreme fatigue—I struggled to work out or stay motivated at work.  
🔹 Mood shifts—I wasn’t as positive or upbeat as usual.  

The Surprising Link Between Caffeine and My Anxiety:

The biggest reason I quit? Anxiety and panic attacks.I had never struggled with panic attacks before, but out of nowhere, I started having them in situations that never used to bother me. It felt like I lost control, like I was going to die.  

I even went to the doctor hoping for a Xanax prescription,but (thankfully) two different doctors refused. Instead, I was given an antihistamine, which just made me tired and still anxious, a terrible combo.  

That’s when I started seriously questioning what was causing this. After quitting caffeine, the panic attacks completely stopped. I still have occasional anxiety, but it’s manageable, and I no longer take medication. I actually enjoy situations now that used to make me panic. 

Even after a full year, I know I’ll never go back. Relying on a drug that affects my central nervous system and caused me to have regular panic attacks isn’t worth it. No drink is worth feeling like I’m going to die.  

Life After Caffeine: The Unexpected Benefits:  

🚀 Time Feels Slower & Energy Feels Stable About two weeks after quitting, I noticed days felt longer in a good way, and my energy levels smoothed out. No more crashes. No more needing a ""fix"" just to function.  

⏰ Waking Up is Easier – I can literally just wake up and start my day. No more feeling dysfunctional until after coffee.  

💼 Better Focus at Work – I don’t get the afternoon slump anymore. Coworkers even noticed and asked how I can stay so focused all day without coffee. Some were oddly offended that I quit caffeine, but others were curious.  

🥤 The Most Inconvenient Part? Social Situations. One thing I didn’t expect is how hard it is to find something to drink when I’m out. Whether at a cookout, family gathering, or restaurant, almost everything has caffeine. I usually have to bring my own seltzer water or the occasional Sprite Zero just to have an option. It’s such a small thing, but it’s something I never thought about before quitting.  

Quitting wasn’t easy, but after one full year, I can confidently say it was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. If you’re thinking about quitting or cutting back, it’s 100% worth it.

Would love to hear from others. how has quitting caffeine changed your life?",8,1743298451.0,decaf,7,0.9,False

1jn1noc,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1jn1noc/off_my_chest/,Off my chest,"I've been wanting to share this for a while, and from what I've read here, this seems like a safe space to do so. I'm a convert to the Orthodox Church, but unlike many zealous converts, I'm Venezuelan and come from a culturally Catholic background. Neither I nor my family actively practiced Catholicism.

A year after moving to the US and working in a Venezuelan restaurant, I met and married my amazing husband, who is also Venezuelan but from non-Venezuelan immigrant parents , and with a non-Christian background. Neither my family nor his saw it as a problem, as we were clearly very much in love and he is also not religious. As life unfolded, I grew closer to Christ, and my husband was supportive. He was very open to the idea. I began searching for a church that would understand me and my marriage.

After doing some research, I decided to explore the Orthodox Church, especially since many Orthodox people share my husband's cultural background. I wasn't focused on complex theology, church history, or religious laws. My interest was in learning directly from Jesus and the Gospels. I wanted to receive communion because, despite not actively practicing Catholicism, I always deeply respected and loved the Eucharist. I also hoped to find a welcoming community that would connect me with my husband's background, even though he isn't Orthodox.

Once, as an inquirer during a liturgy service, a little kid began to sing. Everyone was impressed and started expressing their admiration. I joined in, being a naturally bubbly and talkative person and I pulled my phone to record. But then, I saw a woman turn around with an angry, sour look on her face, giving me a death stare. Well that happened, but I brushed it off because I didn't know anyone. This is the first impression of this woman, which looking back I should of not ignored.

As I continued going to church, I met the women who regularly helped in the kitchen. The lady who had stared at me was there, but she was very kind this time, so I figured she must have just had a bad day. We chatted, and I got to know some of the kitchen ladies. They invited me to help out, and I happily agreed. Since I was becoming a catechumen, the priest explained that I needed a sponsor. I asked that same lady, and it was all settled. Before I knew it, I was being christened.

Things started to feel strange with this woman after my christening. I got to know her, and she invited me to her house, but something felt off, maybe because of our age difference and due to the fact the the tv is on and she bashed Biden's former speaker for being lesbian and started talking smack about inmigrants (which it was highly offensive to me because I'm an immigrant).The Sunday after my christening, I was wearing a dress that showed a little of my neck. As I approached the chalice, she grabbed my hair and pulled it forward to cover my neck and shoulders. Another time, after church, she told me I needed to practice making the sign of the cross in front of a mirror. And during Easter, before I left the church after eating the traditional eggs and dairy, she scolded me for wearing a dress that was too revealing even though I was covered and not showing skin.

Once, I was wearing a sleeveless dress when, after church. She said that she was about to go to her car and get me a sweater , and said I judge too much. In my head, I was just thinking, ""What the heck?"" Another time in liturgy, I was singing with real feeling and got a little too enthusiastic. I have a naturally high voice, so I guess I was pretty loud. She told me to quiet down, but I wasn't trying to be noisy on purpose. I was just enjoying the song and really feeling it. Since my sister moved away, I was feeling pretty lonely. I started confiding in this woman I about some personal issues. However, I've noticed she seems to dislike my husband, likely because his religion that she and others at church view negatively. It's frustrating because she doesn't even know him personally. She said he'll dump me for a woman of his religion or is using me. When I had a car accident, she told me to ask a church guy or my husband for help. She talked trash about my husband then told me to ask him for help when I needed it, WTF so is my husband bad or not lady?? I had a pregnancy scare and told her I thought I was pregnant. Later, after some time, I found out I wasn't, and she responded with a spiteful ""Good."" If I skipped church for over a month, she'd phone to find out why I wasn't attending and to see if I could make it. I became depressed after losing one of my two jobs. Then, she called to ask why I wasn't at church. I explained that I'd lost my best-paying job. She acknowledged that the economy was tough and many were struggling, showing some understanding. However, she finished by telling me to quit feeling sorry for myself. Another time talking to her, she said that I'm gaining some weight, she suggested I lose it and start going to the gym. Then, in the following days, she texted me about wanting me to change my clothes and hairstyle.

Another time, I locked my keys, phone, and purse in the car. I went back inside the church kitchen to find her sweetly encouraging a woman to attend church more often. I interrupted, not intending to be rude, but I was panicking about being locked out. She whirled around, her voice sharp with anger, and snapped, ""I'M TALKING! ""then at the end of kitchen cleaning she said I'm sorry I snapped but you interrupted me.

The straw that broke the camels back was during a small kitchen meeting. The women started chatting amongst themselves, disrupting the leader. When she couldn't regain control, I raised my voice, calling out to my godmother. My godmother then furiously scolded me in front of everyone, and screamed at me saying  NEVER DO THAT AGAIN. I was so humiliated, I almost cried. I apologized, explaining I didn't mean to be disrespectful. Later that day, she messaged me to apologize for snapping at me earlier. She said I needed to treat this meeting professionally and l need to raise my hand and wait for my turn to speak, as she does and she hoped everyone would do the same.  I been avoiding going to coffee hour since that day,  months later one time I stayed because I had to talk to the priest so I stayed for coffee hour . Then, this woman approached me, questioning why I walk through the hallway when I arrive at church and don't acknowledge or speak to her. I explained that I'm often distracted because I'm so busy and have a lot on my plate going on and I sighted and told her I need to speak to the priest. She saw how stressed I was and all she said just eat your food

Being around this woman makes me incredibly anxious. I feel like she's always watching my every move during the liturgy. I'm been avoiding going and honestly, it makes me want to stop going altogether because it causes me so much stress and anxiety. The only reasons I still attend are because of the Eucharist and the priest, who is so relaxed and understanding.  And after reading many of your points I realized the craziness I got myself in without knowing or proper researching. I dont fully agree with many teachings of orthodoxy. I feel stuck .

G-Paw is good enough to accompany Quiana with her Linus-like animal print blankie to the prison, which turns out to be a good thing.  Damodrick, who has a strange profile resembling Michael Five Forehead, has barely time to cop a feel and change clothes before getting to the halfway house on time for his leg monitor so they don’t revoke him.  His 3-year probationary period starts in August, the end date of his sentence when his monitor comes off.  He’s not your typical felon serving two years for a firearm under felony indictment and possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.  He’s a college man majoring in physical therapy, but like so many others, got involved with the wrong people doing the wrong things.  He was shot in the shoulder, so he carried a gun for protection and, for a while, was pulled over twice a week, which didn’t seem to faze him.

This love story began when Damodrick was 16 years old, and Quiana was a transitional 12-years old and who already knew what she wanted.  But Damodrick made her wait until she was older, even though he didn’t wait and had six kids with three different women, and when he was in college, ‘allowed’ her to take care of him.  Notwithstanding, their history will purportedly garner her a proposal and his faithfulness.  But now it’s been 2 ½ hours since he checked in and played butt bongo in front of G-Paw, and Quiana is becoming restless.  She calls only to find out from the counselor that Damodrick is not leaving.  He entered another division with the Bureau of Prisons and there were ‘misunderstandings’ so until those are cleared up, Quiana will have to retreat to lose her shit in her room, peel off those eyelashes, and wipe off the strange coffee-and-milk colored cream embrocation outlining her forehead.  She’s right when she unconsciously quotes Gilda Radner, “It’s like my father always said to me; he said, Roseanna, Roseannadana, it’s always something.  If it isn’t one thing, it’s another!  It’s always something.”  *You might as well pronounce the ‘L’ in salmon; nothing matters anymore.*

**“Was He A Whore In The Past?  Is He Still A Whore?”**

She’s a right mouthy little cowgirl now with a tat of his name taken from his signature on a V-Day card.  Bonus point for that romantic personalization.  Deduction for having to sleep with JK’s mother, Cathy, in a single bed in their shared hotel room.  Cathy is a substantial woman who wants Brooke to put the brakes on the relationship, but that would be like trying to stop your bikini top from slipping off during a failed mechanical bull ride, or not trying to deliberately get pregnant again with an ex-con you barely know when you have other children with different absentee baby daddies you can’t already afford.  JK is her booster, and no, he doesn’t need free breathing time like Mama suggests; he needs to be lassoed and thrown into a boot camp husband/daddy situation ASAP to foster responsibility.  Only there’s Alex, ex-girlfriend and family member by now, that might weird out the situation – not like a defiant Brooke who has no qualms about calling her man a whore in front of his mother who takes the not-so veiled insult with the aplomb inherent in anyone weighing enough to anchor their side of the bed and argument.

The prize, in prison whites, and displaying enough tattoos to qualify for a collage, doesn’t look much like a changed man who’s been on-and-off drugs and in-and-out of jail from age 17 to 31 years old, during which he lost both grandfathers.  *The cop pulled me over and asked, “Are you drinking?”  I asked, “You buying”?  We laughed and laughed.  I need bail money.*   

**I’d Appreciate It If You Started Treating Me Like A Sex Object**

Bradly is literally and metaphorically taking the wheel.  He has one week to get his affairs in order until he goes back to his roofing gig, so he doesn’t have sex on his mind or an attitude; he’s got a full bladder speaking its piece, Savannah.  And now that she sprung meeting her mother, Chenowa, on him, he all of a sudden, is too tired for dinner and wants to go directly to bed since they had that rocky chinwag about relationship ethics a few months ago.  Chenowa, however, an advocate for released prisoners, gives him the warm hug and welcome that Savannah knew she would.  Savannah is still grappling with her body image, having weighed 300 lbs. once and having gastric bypass surgery at 21 years old and a recent tummy tuck for good measure.  Bradley thinks her 150 lbs. on a 5’4” frame is healthy looking, but “There’s still work to be done,” Savannah says, and she’s right even though she’s concentrating on the wrong elements.  *I’m not asking much.  Just treat me like a lady and fuck me like a whore.*

**I Wish I Was His Balls So I Could Hang With Him All Day**

Besides her dog, Gigi, Brian is Brooklyn’s ride-or-die.  He’s doing six years for aggravated robbery and firearm in a motor vehicle.  Like Quiana, she met Brian in school, and was so intrigued by his quietness that she gave him purple kisses, and he liked her chunky cheeks.  Time passed, he went inside, and a mutual friend reached out, so they hooked up again.  

When Brooklyn was 10 days old, she and her brother, Jermaine's, mother, Juanita, unexpectedly died from an aneurysm after complaining about a headache.  They filed a wrongful death suit and received a hefty but unspecified settlement.  Jermaine wonders if that’s the draw for Brian at the ‘goodbye bachelorette’ party Brooklyn has thrown for herself.  He’s there with his sibling, Ray, and friends who worry that Brooklyn is being naïve.  She doesn’t like being ‘grilled’ and goes outside to take a reassuring call from Brian, who gives her the us-against-the-world line.  When she returns to the table, she wants everyone to support her fairy tale.  Jermaine laid it down with, “If it was a fairy tale, he wouldn’t be in jail.”  Brooklyn is savvy enough to know that HER man is 100% faithful NOW, even though there was that pesky NJ bitch who should fry in hell and who makes Brooklyn fear she may have been wasting her time.  *And she gave no fucks.  Not even one.  And she lived happily ever after.* 

**“I’m Out This Bitch”**

Ashley stands like one of the Mt. Rushmore mountains, solid and towering, but instead of a presidential face, she’s topped with Julius’ name on her chest. An extreme move, her friends, Brittney, Kandi, and pessimist, Casey, think as they shop in a party store to decorate some phantom room in which the tattooed lanky Julius does not appear. Casey’s been there before, and she hasn’t liked Julius since Day 1 because Julius failed to get his matching tat.  There’s jail talk, real talk, and home talk.  Ashley is confident they will throw back tonight and tomorrow, even though she hasn't heard a word from him when she, too, plans to get pregnant, although she is already looking swollen.  She’s planning airy fairy camping and hiking trips for a man for whom the outside is but an anteroom to a club packed with moist women, the intoxicating aroma of reefer, the thunder and reverberation of rap, and the sight of coke mountains that would excite Tony Montana.

Meanwhile . . .

This is Alexis’ first meeting outside prison, and she is anxiously awaiting a solo romantic reunion when she is bushwacked by the unexpected appearances of Tyler, Julius’ braided brother-in-law, and Jordan, his pockmarked and scraggly haired friend of 15 years, both looking as reputable as Julius himself, all of 6’6” and 152 lbs., who swaggers out with as much arrogance as Diddy and Kanye have for the world.  If his face were tilted up any higher, the balls of his feet any punchier, his voice any trillier, and his eyes any more unfocused, honest citizens would run.  He’s treated like the king Trump thinks he is with a shot of Patron that has him smacking his lips and acknowledging his first legal drink.  He sold fentanyl at age 15-16 years old, and that netted him a house raid where he ended up catching a 6-year sentence for aggravated trafficking in drugs, possession of drugs, and attempted aggravated possession of drugs in various degrees.  He “don’t wanna’ go back in,” but “gotta go live it up.”   All this is voiced while helpless Alexis, who can see him anytime, is steaming behind the wheel of her car, having to drive to breakfast alone when he decides to ride with his posse and marvel over his cellphone – the link to communication and freedom.  From her.  She’s the one who spent 11-12K on his miserable scrawny ass and was giddy chirruping, “My man, my man,” more excited about the thought of a man because she “needs someone to love on” than the man himself.

Julius’ energy be good” when he’s around Alexis, who, when he learned the hard way who his family and friends really were, served as their proxy, but Ashley’s unpredictability excites him.  He shrugs his shoulders unfazed by the hypocrisy that life superimposes on individuals torn by the relentless entreaties of the good and bad angels perched on their shoulders, “Don’t like sneaking around, but it’s gotta’ be done.”   *People say I have a bad attitude; I say fuck them.”*  

**“Done Defending Him”**

But not done loving him - a man who’s a habitual offender and addict and looks like he smells like a cafeteria in the August heat.  This time, Michael’s in a committed relationship when he’s released, and he’s been supported the entire time he’s been incarcerated, unlike a lot of other inmates, so he should try harder and that should make the difference.  Joey is calm to Michael’s madness.  He prayed to God to make him straight when he was younger and considered himself effeminate because he liked to play with a video camera and play music.  Maybe, to deny his true self, he enlisted in the Navy at 17 years old, but that’s where he met his first true love and was in a good relationship for two years.  He wasn’t used to being gay, however, as he admitted, and dipped out on his lover, breaking his heart.  He then met up with his old high school druggie buddies and that was it.  Meth took him away from his family and himself, and it’s not done with him yet because he was looking forward to calling the contacts on his phone when the helpful factory reset bombshell dropped. His response was an immediate and heated, “Don’t do that because I’m gonna’ do what I wanna’ do.”  He wants a fresh start while he’s sneaking using.  *I’m going to try putting others first for a change . . . Ok.  That’s long enough.”*

My sister had an Econoline cargo van, the kind without windows on the sides. She converted to a camper, by adding shelfs on one wall and stuffing a mattress in the back that covered the entire cargo area.

At the start of my junior year in high school, she let me drive it the first week because her college didn’t start a week later.

The first day I picked up one of my friends, Tom, and we drove to school together. At school I ran into my friend Mark and told him I had the van so he asked if I could give him a ride home. I told the van only had two seats so he would have to ride in back.

After school I expected to see only Tom and Mark waiting for me, but as I approach the van, I noticed a small crowd around the it. Tom told his girlfriend J I would drive her home, and she told two of her female friends K and M. They all expected me to drive them home. They were already there, so what option did I have. Plus, taking them all home, meant I got to drive the van a lot more. Tom got in up front while everyone else climbed in the back and spread out on the mattress.

K lived the closest, so I stopped at her house first. When Tom opened the side door, K rolled out onto the grass area between the street and the sidewalk.

That is where this story takes a turn.

The next day, Mark told me that I had to take K home again, but I had to drop her off last. After I dropped off Mark and Tom off at Tom’s house, I drove K home. As I pulled up, I saw woman, who I later found out was K’s mother, standing on the sidewalk. As soon as I stopped, she walked around to the driver’s window and asked if I wanted to come in for a glass of lemonade.

My parents taught me to be respectful to my elders, so even though I assumed K’s mother wanted to lecture me about the danger of letting people ride in the back of a van without seats, I accepted the invitation.

Once inside K’s mom and I sat down at the kitchen table, while K got both of us both a glass of lemonade. After dropping of the lemonade K rushed out of the room and went to change out of her school clothes. A little additional information, even though K was a sophomore, she was only five months younger than me.

As soon as K left the room the interrogation started. K’s mother asked me all kinds of questions. First, ‘Did I always drive that van’. I told her that I usually drove my motorcycle, which seemed to upset her even more. Next, she asked if I had access to other vehicles, and I said sometimes my parents let me drive my dad’s truck or my mom’s car.

While we were talking, L, K’s younger sister popped in and out of the kitchen several times. First for a glass of lemonade, then an orange and finally the throw the orange peels away. Each time L came in she gave me a big smile. This is important information; L is only a year younger than K.

At the end of our talk K’s mom said something that shocked me. “You have my permission to take K to the football game this Friday, but you will bring her straight home afterwards.”

Some clarification. I had just turned sixteen that July, and only had my driver’s license for two months. Also, I had never even been on a date before, I mean what kid wants their parents to drive them on their first date. At that moment, the thought of going on my first date excited me, but the way her mom looked at me scared me even more. Fear actually won as I didn’t have the nerve to reject her offer.

K and I dated on and off for the next six years. Most of the offs were because K broke up with me every time I did something to make her mad. But we always got back together, mainly because I really liked her family especially L. L and I flirted every time I want over their house.

Now early on in K’s and my relationship, their mother strongly suggested that we take L with us, even to that first football game. I think K’s mom’s thought it might help keep her eldest daughter pure a little longer, although it didn’t work out that way. The three of us would go to a drive-in movie almost ever Saturday, L would sit in front and watch the movie, while K and I sit in back and did our own thing. Once K caught L watching us in the rearview mirror, after that she made me push it out of the way before we got in back.

During my freshman year at college, K got into a bad traffic accident and ended up in the hospital for several days. K’s parents both had a hard time getting off work, so her mom called and asked me to pick L up from school and take her to the hospital to be with her sister.

After her parents arrived there, I took L home so she could do her homework. Except, once we got back to her house, L said she had to go into her bedroom to change. Except, before she walked away, she gave me that ‘come with me look’, so I followed into her room. We ended up on her bed half naked with our bodies intertwined. It probably would have gone a lot farther if L had been on birth control and didn’t have a serious boyfriend.

See I told you I was the asshole.

After a while we came up for air, and realized we had made a huge mistake. L and I both agreed we should never do that again.

The summer after L graduated from high school she and her boyfriend got married and he enlisted the Navy. K and I waited another three years, as it took me five years to complete my degree.

K’s and L’s parents were both teachers, mom taught 4^(th) grade while dad taught math at the local community college. The summer after K and I got married, her parents rented a cabin on a lake, and invited all of us to join them. L’s husband couldn’t make it the first week because he had duty, so L drove up with us. We hiked, fished, water skied, swam and just basically wound down.

It had been a fairly stressful year for me; new job, new marriage, plus K had been pressing me to start a family. She didn’t see any reason to wait since we had already been together for six years, while I felt we needed to be more finically stable.

On the third night, after yet another argument on the subject, except during this one K told me that she had already stopped taking the pill. Mad beyond control I got out of bed and went for a walk. I guess L hadn’t been able to get to sleep either because I found her standing by the edge of the lake looking for shooting stars. If you know anything about astronomy the Perseid meteor shower is at its peak during August.

The irritation had made me lose my mind, so when I saw the moon light on L’s face I couldn’t hold back. I grabbed her and we kissed. Then we laid down in the grass and ended up recreating our make out session. Except, this time we didn’t stop. Afterwards we both realized we had made a big mistake and promised to never tell our spouses.

My marriage basically ended that night, although the death spiral lasted until the next summer. Mike, his wife, Tom who wasn’t seeing anyone at the time, rented a house boat together with me and K. Near the end of the two weeks, K told me she was going home with Tom. They left a day early and when I got home, she had cleared most of the stuff out of our apartment.

As for my agreement with L, I mostly followed through with. Except after I dropped the signed divorce papers at K’s lawyer’s office, I called L and asked if she wanted to meet for coffee. Thankfully, she said no.

Without much to split, only the furniture we brought for our apartment and the wedding gifts, we had a fairly amicable divorce.

Another interesting fact. I had never been with another woman until that night, but I later found out from Mark that during our last break Tom and K had hooked, and he knew she had hooked up with at least one other guy beside Tom. So, looking back on it now, I really don’t feel that bad about what happened.

A little over year after K left me, I met my current wife. We dated for two years later before we married.

If you’re wondering what happened with L, well I haven’t seen her since that night. However; around ten years ago my mom called me to tell me that their father had passed away, I looked them up on Facebook so I could send them my condolences. At that time L’s bio said she and her husband were still married. As for K. She married Tom as they say ‘almost before the ink was even dry on the divorce decree’.

Some people say that ‘A tiger can’t change its stripes’, but this tiger did. I have been a faithful pussy cat for 45 years.

if you think I was the asshole, I totally agree with you. When I look back on that time in my life, I can’t believe I behaved that way. Thankfully I’ve matured a lot since then.

P.S. After I wrote this story, I looked K and L up one more time. K’s status is now listed as widow, but I don’t have any desire to contacting either of them.",1,1743297708.0,u_dumbshit_1951,0,1.0,False

Venti Rant,I know I’m being dramatic probably but this year the snowbirds have been extra aggressive and entitled and it has been rough making connections when we are constantly being verbally attacked because they don’t know what they’re ordering. Most recently I was helping a customer who ordered a “tall pike” and a tall cup of ice when I hand him his cup of ice he was like NO I SAID A TALL LIKE AS IN A BIG AS IT GETS WHY WOULD I WANT THAT. So I as nice as possible try to explain that a tall is small like what size he ordered his coffee is and he looks at me and goes yea yea sweetheart you know what I meant. I try so hard to create connections but I’ve been having such a hard time lately. I feel so drained. Since January I have been screamed at more times than ever. Time one I had strep throat and so I had a mask on which truthfully I should have been home but iykyk and this man walked in looked at me and became so annoyed when I took his order then when he went to pay he tapped the 5$ because he didn’t look at the tip first and then started screaming at me that I was a thief and of course wouldn’t let me explain that he hadn’t even been charged yet and the mistake he made and started spit swearing at me (still got his drink recovered) then when the new policy started I’ve been argued with so many times but the worst has to be when I asked the guy that came in if he was picking up a mobile( that’s my go to) if they beeline for the bathroom without buying something and he angrily looked at me and said no I’ll purchase after. Then when he got out in front of both my DM and Manager points at me and says let me tell you something don’t ever do that again you will not gain customers that way that’s not how business works and that he personally knows the “founder” of Starbucks and that is not his policy. To which i apologize and say I’m just following policy and then he said I was just like Hitler to “kill all the Jews and ask questions later”. I was actually sick anyway here’s to hoping that the birds go home soon and things return back to normal with our regulars. ,1,1743297577.0,starbucks,1,1.0,False
1jn1fcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1jn1fcf/opportunity_is_dead_and_i_killed_her/,"Opportunity Is Dead, And I Killed Her","She was beautiful. Her raven black hair floated in the wind, catching the sun’s rays in their dark tendrils and drawing me in. Each of her steps were long and calculated—she glided across the Earth with the fleeting steps of an angel not long for this world. 

From the moment I first laid eyes on her, she was christened Opportunity within my thoughts. It’s exceedingly on the nose, but I’ve never been one for subtlety. And when I watched her, skin unmarred by age and life, I couldn’t help but imagine everything she would do.

I didn’t approach her, call it fear or reverence. Instead, I observed her from afar. Opportunity was in college to pursue an education major. She lived in the smallest dorm on the very outskirts of campus. Her room number was 307, and she didn't have any roommates. 

She could usually be found in the library between classes, but the majority of her time was spent swiping through her phone rather than studying. One day I strolled behind her—trying to seem as inconspicuous as possible—and glanced at the faintly glowing screen. Her laptop was open to a blank document, but her phone was open to the Messenger app. I didn't catch the exact contents, yet I could see she was typing a paragraph worth of text. I imagined who it could be intended for: A shopping list for a friend? A text to her mother? A reprimand for a boyfriend?

It matters little, for I saw Opportunity delete whatever she was drafting and lay her phone down. After a sufficient amount of time had elapsed, I passed behind her again. She was holding her head in both hands. 

Perhaps that was the first crack in the perfect being that was Opportunity, but it wouldn’t be the last.

They came slowly at first. She would just barely make it to her class on time one day, and the next, her eyes would be stained dark by bags. It pained me. Nonetheless, I continued my vigilant communion, basking in the privilege of her presence.

It wasn’t until the day before graduation that my conviction broke. It was so minute that no one else could have seen it. No one else knew her like I did, so of course they didn’t notice. But I did. The faintest of wrinkles had begun forming right above her brow. Small, but we both knew that was simply a sign for what was to come.

It was at that moment I decided to save her. Rescue her from the decay that overtakes all mortal beings.

Opportunity went to bed early that night and so did I. She rose at dawn and moved to get ready for the ceremony. It was about what I expected, yet I couldn’t stop my heart from pounding against my ribs. It threatened to claw its way out and towards the girl who had my entire concentration. 

Oddly enough, Opportunity didn’t seem all too excited about the proceedings either. She received her diploma, tossed her cap into the air, and immediately returned to her dorm. She told her friends she had to get packed—much to their dismay—but that was a lie. 

By the time I made the solemn trek to the towering brick building which Opportunity called home, the sun had already set. I managed to slip through the open staircase door as a resident brushed by me on their way out.

And so I marched upwards. One flight. Two flights. I pushed my way into the empty hallway of the 3rd story without a word. My footsteps were muffled by the thick carpet, and there were no other sounds throughout the entire building.

I measured my resolve and stalked through the winding halls until reaching the door with *307* stenciled over its face. I found it unlocked.

Opportunity’s room was silent, and the lights were off. The click of the lock behind me resounded like a gunshot, but she didn’t move. She just sat there, not even 6 feet away, with her back to me. She leaned forward on a small futon and peered at something in her hands. I approached, yet she gave no sign of recognizing my presence. As my shaky legs carried me to her side and my eyes adjusted to the dark, I saw that which she glared at with teary eyes.

It was her diploma. Rather, it was a promise of a diploma. In practice it was little more than a blank scroll, not even a word to break the opaque white surface. Opportunity’s hands shook, and I watched as barely held back sobs turned into streams of salty tears which dripped onto the paper held in her hands.

I expected some resistance as I reached into my waistband and pulled out a small pistol, yet the only response I inspired were louder sounds of anguish. I raised the firearm and pressed it against her temple.

Opportunity only closed her eyes.

Even in the dark of the room, the stains along the wall and soaking into the futon were visible, but in such deep shadows, crimson just looked to be an even deeper black.

The suffocating silence of the building seemed to wrap around my head and squeeze. My thoughts grew fuzzy as I stumbled through the blindingly bright hallway. I couldn’t breathe. My eyes stung, and my throat swelled shut. My skull pulsed to the rhythm of my heartbeat, and my stomach writhed within my gut like a serpent.

By the time I made it to the first floor, I found myself whimpering involuntarily. Pathetic squeaks and cries; the sounds of a mouse being crushed beneath a boot. The thought made me wretch, but I managed to emerge outside and fall to my knees onto a patch of grass. I laid there for what felt like hours, curling into the fetal position and rocking back and forth.

The distant sounds of sirens drug me back to conscious thought, and I pushed myself to my feet. I managed to make my way to the apartment where I was staying. Countless nosy neighbors littered the parking lot and ground floor—no doubt awoken by the bang of a gunshot and subsequent roar of sirens—but none of them paid me any mind. I fell into bed that night and wept into my pillow. I finally succumbed to slumber when my voice was too hoarse to keep me awake.

That night I dreamed that I had dreamed. The nightmare within the nightmare was about a girl, perhaps she was in her thirties? She smiled and wrapped her arms around a group of children. Not hers. The raven-haired woman was a teacher, and her students loved her. They would grow up to be scientists, engineers, and teachers themselves, but no matter their occupation, each and every one carried Opportunity in their hearts.

When I opened my eyes again, a piercing pain arced through my head. It was worse than any hangover I’ve ever experienced, and my usual remedies didn’t ease the ache. Groaning and sipping from coffee, I peered out the window, and I felt my heart race. The most beautiful women I’ve ever seen strolled by my apartment. Opportunity was on her way to class; graduation was three weeks away.

Opportunity was in college to pursue a biomedical major. She lived in the smallest dorm on the very outskirts of campus. Her room number was 307, and she didn't have any roommates. 

She could usually be found out with friends between classes. She often got in arguments with her parents while drunk, slurring words and yelling into her phone. Maybe it was the alcohol, but the curves which had previously clung to her sides began to disappear, replaced by oddly fitting skin. I decided to prevent the effects of any further degradation. Any further defacing.

On the night of graduation, Opportunity tripped into her room, opened the window, and simply allowed the cold night air to wash over her. I saw her curtains flapping in the wind as I slipped into the building, brushing by a resident on their way out. Opportunity didn’t react as I placed my hands on her shoulders and pushed.

There was less than a second of suspense followed by a soft thud.

I made my way back home with tears in my eyes, and climbed to my room on the 3rd floor. There was a sickeningly sweet stench as I pushed through the door. I had adequately scrubbed the blood from the walls and futon, but her body still lay on the floor, hair splayed outwards in a morbid ray of blood soaked darkness. Despite the smell, what's left of her face is as pretty as the day I first saw her.

That night I dreamed that I had dreamed. The nightmare within the nightmare was about a girl, she was in her forties. I watched as she fell into a pit of addiction—she wastes decades of her life. Then she finds friends who hold her hand in a time of need. The woman goes back to school and eventually gets a job as a doctor. Opportunity makes sure to help those with no one to turn to just as her friends did so many years ago.

Every bone in my body ached when I rose from bed and looked out the window. A woman strolled by, her hair rippling in the breeze.

Opportunity was in college to pursue a history major. She lived in the smallest dorm on the very outskirts of campus. Her room number was 307, and she didn't have any roommates.

I drug the blade across her throat and watched as her face drained of color.

I went home that night to find a body leaning against the wall beneath, arms and legs twisted awkwardly. Her neck bent back—over the bottom lip of the open window—and her hair perpetually caught the wind.

I dreamt of a woman who moved overseas and found the love of her life. My throat burned and my wrists stung when I opened my eyes the next morning.

She pursued a biology major.

She pursued an engineering major.

She dropped out.

I tripped over the bodies in an attempt to make it to my bed. They seemed to shift when I wasn’t looking. I woke up. I dreamed. I looked out my window. 

When I entered room 307, Opportunity laid on her bed. She didn’t say anything as I cut the wire to her unplugged lamp, and she didn't respond as I wrapped it around her neck. With a lurch, the wire went taught.

She looked at me.

No.

That couldn’t be right.

But she did. Her eyes locked with mine, and tears began to flow. They streamed down our faces and mingled in a pool on the bed sheets. I found myself leaning closer until my hair fell over hers in a curtain. We are alone in a cage of raven black, nothing but two faces watching eachother sob.

There’s a snap. Did the wire break?

Not this time. She’s dead. I checked her pulse, checked it again, and checked it three more times. I loved her too much to let her lie in the bed like that. Trapped in her mind with a body that wouldn’t respond and nothing to do but relive all the opportunities she missed.

The next morning, I was lying in bed next to a body whose neck bent at an uncomfortable angle.

She pursued an economics major.

She pursued a chemistry major.

She pursued an English major.

I opened my eyes to find that my lungs wouldn’t take in air. It was dark, and I felt a crushing weight all around me. Squirming, I managed to reach upwards with one arm and tighten my grip around something long and stringy. I wrenched downwards and managed to rise to a sitting position. Then I raised my other arm and felt my exposed skin kiss the open air.

Pulling myself from the mountain of smooth faced bodies like a stick pulled from quicksand, I could just barely make out a sliver of glass along one wall. The very top of a half buried window. Pressing my face against the stomach of a corpse, I peered through the opening with one eye. Opportunity was on her way to class again.

The sea of flesh beneath me seemed to pulse and undulate like waves under the moon’s pull. There’s always another Opportunity.

Even in my dreams, there’s always another opportunity, but all of them are destined to die. Or maybe they’ve already died?

Perhaps they’ve been rotting since that rope snapped along with my neck. Perhaps there is a deity out there that feels it necessary to remind me of what could have been. Or perhaps there is no god, and I did this to myself.

Every day I peer out a window, waiting for someone to move this corpse of Opportunity because she can’t move herself. I watch people—those who hate me for what I did—do everything in their power to keep me alive.

Then they lay me back down, and every night, I am cursed to discover evermore cadavers of opportunity lost.

There’s always another Opportunity, but she’s always dead. She’s dead, and I’m the one who killed her.She was beautiful. Her raven black hair floated in the wind, catching the sun’s rays in their dark tendrils and drawing me in. Each of her steps were long and calculated—she glided across the Earth with the fleeting steps of an angel not long for this world. 

From the moment I first laid eyes on her, she was christened Opportunity within my thoughts. It’s exceedingly on the nose, but I’ve never been one for subtlety. And when I watched her, skin unmarred by age and life, I couldn’t help but imagine everything she would do.

I didn’t approach her, call it fear or reverence. Instead, I observed her from afar. Opportunity was in college to pursue an education major. She lived in the smallest dorm on the very outskirts of campus. Her room number was 307, and she didn't have any roommates. 

She could usually be found in the library between classes, but the majority of her time was spent swiping through her phone rather than studying. One day I strolled behind her—trying to seem as inconspicuous as possible—and glanced at the faintly glowing screen. Her laptop was open to a blank document, but her phone was open to the Messenger app. I didn't catch the exact contents, yet I could see she was typing a paragraph worth of text. I imagined who it could be intended for: A shopping list for a friend? A text to her mother? A reprimand for a boyfriend?

It matters little, for I saw Opportunity delete whatever she was drafting and lay her phone down. After a sufficient amount of time had elapsed, I passed behind her again. She was holding her head in both hands. 

Perhaps that was the first crack in the perfect being that was Opportunity, but it wouldn’t be the last.

They came slowly at first. She would just barely make it to her class on time one day, and the next, her eyes would be stained dark by bags. It pained me. Nonetheless, I continued my vigilant communion, basking in the privilege of her presence.

It wasn’t until the day before graduation that my conviction broke. It was so minute that no one else could have seen it. No one else knew her like I did, so of course they didn’t notice. But I did. The faintest of wrinkles had begun forming right above her brow. Small, but we both knew that was simply a sign for what was to come.

It was at that moment I decided to save her. Rescue her from the decay that overtakes all mortal beings.

Opportunity went to bed early that night and so did I. She rose at dawn and moved to get ready for the ceremony. It was about what I expected, yet I couldn’t stop my heart from pounding against my ribs. It threatened to claw its way out and towards the girl who had my entire concentration. 

Oddly enough, Opportunity didn’t seem all too excited about the proceedings either. She received her diploma, tossed her cap into the air, and immediately returned to her dorm. She told her friends she had to get packed—much to their dismay—but that was a lie. 

By the time I made the solemn trek to the towering brick building which Opportunity called home, the sun had already set. I managed to slip through the open staircase door as a resident brushed by me on their way out.

And so I marched upwards. One flight. Two flights. I pushed my way into the empty hallway of the 3rd story without a word. My footsteps were muffled by the thick carpet, and there were no other sounds throughout the entire building.

I measured my resolve and stalked through the winding halls until reaching the door with *307* stenciled over its face. I found it unlocked.

Opportunity’s room was silent, and the lights were off. The click of the lock behind me resounded like a gunshot, but she didn’t move. She just sat there, not even 6 feet away, with her back to me. She leaned forward on a small futon and peered at something in her hands. I approached, yet she gave no sign of recognizing my presence. As my shaky legs carried me to her side and my eyes adjusted to the dark, I saw that which she glared at with teary eyes.

It was her diploma. Rather, it was a promise of a diploma. In practice it was little more than a blank scroll, not even a word to break the opaque white surface. Opportunity’s hands shook, and I watched as barely held back sobs turned into streams of salty tears which dripped onto the paper held in her hands.

I expected some resistance as I reached into my waistband and pulled out a small pistol, yet the only response I inspired were louder sounds of anguish. I raised the firearm and pressed it against her temple.

Opportunity only closed her eyes.

Even in the dark of the room, the stains along the wall and soaking into the futon were visible, but in such deep shadows, crimson just looked to be an even deeper black.

The suffocating silence of the building seemed to wrap around my head and squeeze. My thoughts grew fuzzy as I stumbled through the blindingly bright hallway. I couldn’t breathe. My eyes stung, and my throat swelled shut. My skull pulsed to the rhythm of my heartbeat, and my stomach writhed within my gut like a serpent.

By the time I made it to the first floor, I found myself whimpering involuntarily. Pathetic squeaks and cries; the sounds of a mouse being crushed beneath a boot. The thought made me wretch, but I managed to emerge outside and fall to my knees onto a patch of grass. I laid there for what felt like hours, curling into the fetal position and rocking back and forth.

The distant sounds of sirens drug me back to conscious thought, and I pushed myself to my feet. I managed to make my way to the apartment where I was staying. Countless nosy neighbors littered the parking lot and ground floor—no doubt awoken by the bang of a gunshot and subsequent roar of sirens—but none of them paid me any mind. I fell into bed that night and wept into my pillow. I finally succumbed to slumber when my voice was too hoarse to keep me awake.

That night I dreamed that I had dreamed. The nightmare within the nightmare was about a girl, perhaps she was in her thirties? She smiled and wrapped her arms around a group of children. Not hers. The raven-haired woman was a teacher, and her students loved her. They would grow up to be scientists, engineers, and teachers themselves, but no matter their occupation, each and every one carried Opportunity in their hearts.

When I opened my eyes again, a piercing pain arced through my head. It was worse than any hangover I’ve ever experienced, and my usual remedies didn’t ease the ache. Groaning and sipping from coffee, I peered out the window, and I felt my heart race. The most beautiful women I’ve ever seen strolled by my apartment. Opportunity was on her way to class; graduation was three weeks away.

Opportunity was in college to pursue a biomedical major. She lived in the smallest dorm on the very outskirts of campus. Her room number was 307, and she didn't have any roommates. 

She could usually be found out with friends between classes. She often got in arguments with her parents while drunk, slurring words and yelling into her phone. Maybe it was the alcohol, but the curves which had previously clung to her sides began to disappear, replaced by oddly fitting skin. I decided to prevent the effects of any further degradation. Any further defacing.

On the night of graduation, Opportunity tripped into her room, opened the window, and simply allowed the cold night air to wash over her. I saw her curtains flapping in the wind as I slipped into the building, brushing by a resident on their way out. Opportunity didn’t react as I placed my hands on her shoulders and pushed.

There was less than a second of suspense followed by a soft thud.

I made my way back home with tears in my eyes, and climbed to my room on the 3rd floor. There was a sickeningly sweet stench as I pushed through the door. I had adequately scrubbed the blood from the walls and futon, but her body still lay on the floor, hair splayed outwards in a morbid ray of blood soaked darkness. Despite the smell, what's left of her face is as pretty as the day I first saw her.

That night I dreamed that I had dreamed. The nightmare within the nightmare was about a girl, she was in her forties. I watched as she fell into a pit of addiction—she wastes decades of her life. Then she finds friends who hold her hand in a time of need. The woman goes back to school and eventually gets a job as a doctor. Opportunity makes sure to help those with no one to turn to just as her friends did so many years ago.

Every bone in my body ached when I rose from bed and looked out the window. A woman strolled by, her hair rippling in the breeze.

Opportunity was in college to pursue a history major. She lived in the smallest dorm on the very outskirts of campus. Her room number was 307, and she didn't have any roommates.

I drug the blade across her throat and watched as her face drained of color.

I went home that night to find a body leaning against the wall beneath, arms and legs twisted awkwardly. Her neck bent back—over the bottom lip of the open window—and her hair perpetually caught the wind.

I dreamt of a woman who moved overseas and found the love of her life. My throat burned and my wrists stung when I opened my eyes the next morning.

She pursued a biology major.

She pursued an engineering major.

She dropped out.

I tripped over the bodies in an attempt to make it to my bed. They seemed to shift when I wasn’t looking. I woke up. I dreamed. I looked out my window. 

When I entered room 307, Opportunity laid on her bed. She didn’t say anything as I cut the wire to her unplugged lamp, and she didn't respond as I wrapped it around her neck. With a lurch, the wire went taught.

She looked at me.

No.

That couldn’t be right.

But she did. Her eyes locked with mine, and tears began to flow. They streamed down our faces and mingled in a pool on the bed sheets. I found myself leaning closer until my hair fell over hers in a curtain. We are alone in a cage of raven black, nothing but two faces watching eachother sob.

There’s a snap. Did the wire break?

Not this time. She’s dead. I checked her pulse, checked it again, and checked it three more times. I loved her too much to let her lie in the bed like that. Trapped in her mind with a body that wouldn’t respond and nothing to do but relive all the opportunities she missed.

The next morning, I was lying in bed next to a body whose neck bent at an uncomfortable angle.

She pursued an economics major.

She pursued a chemistry major.

She pursued an English major.

I opened my eyes to find that my lungs wouldn’t take in air. It was dark, and I felt a crushing weight all around me. Squirming, I managed to reach upwards with one arm and tighten my grip around something long and stringy. I wrenched downwards and managed to rise to a sitting position. Then I raised my other arm and felt my exposed skin kiss the open air.

Pulling myself from the mountain of smooth faced bodies like a stick pulled from quicksand, I could just barely make out a sliver of glass along one wall. The very top of a half buried window.

This is my first script so I hope it's alright! I am open to constructive criticism to help me improve on my work!

Feel free to monetize off of this script! It would be an honour to get a video made from it. 

In the script R= Roomie (Roommate) 

Parts surrounded by [Square brackets] are opportunities to add your own ideas in! You can use what is provided in the script or you can ad-lib it a bit!

[START] 

*Sound of a clock ticking in the background for a few seconds before there is the sound of your door opening.*

*You hear rummaging around for a second before it suddenly stops*


R: What are you still doing up?

R: Hey, I asked you first so you gotta respect the rules. Why are you still awake?

R: Too much coffee? Dude, I told you that new espresso machine was going to be your undoing! Yet you still bought it.

R: I know I use it just as much as you- but that's besides the point! You gotta get to sleep, it's late! 

R: Why am I still up? Well... I watched a horror movie and I can't sleep... speaking of, where is that night light you use sometimes?

*More rummaging around is heard*

R: Yes I know I made fun of it but now isn't the time to- ugh, yes, I admit it's not bad. Now where is it?

R: What? How do you break a night light? 

R: Ugh nevermind then I've got a better idea. 

*She lifts up the covers and tries to get in the bed*

R: What does it look like I'm doing? I'm getting in your bed. If I'm in a room with you I'll feel more safe

R: I don't care if there's not much space in there! I'm getting in! Now move.

*She gets into the bed and yawns*

R: Ah, there we are... Well... goodnight, dude

*A bit of silence with the clock ticking again*

*Listener shakes Roomie to wake her up*

R: Ugh, what do you want? I'm trying to sleep here. 

R: Oh right. You're still hopped up on caffeine. Just a sec

*Typing on a phone is heard*

R: Shush, I'm searching something up... Gentle talking... heartbeat... warmth... Alright. C'mere

R: What do you think I mean? Come closer to me. 

*Listener nudges closer, but only slightly*

R: Dude, I'm not going to bite. Just- here.

*Roomie wraps her arms around Listener and pulls them closer.*

R: According to this... hearing gentle voices and a heartbeat can get you to sleep so lie on my chest and we'll talk about some stuff.

R: Yeah, I said lie on my chest.

R: Why not? Are you scared or my boobs or something? They don't bite either. 

*Listener gets closer to her*

R: That's it, just lie your head down.

*Listener lie their head on Roomie's chest and a heartbeat is heard.*

R: Alright... so... If you could have any superpower, what would it be? 

R: What? What else am I meant to say?  I've gotta say something with my super soothing voice, don't I? So what would it be?

R: Personally, I would pick [the ability to freeze time because then I could get to places instantly while still burning calories and I could punch people that annoy me without them knowing it was me!]

R: Oh yeah? Well, what would you pick?

R: You're right that is better. Damn... Uh, well next question! What animal would you be if you could be an animal?

R: What? No this isn't me secretly confessing I'm a furry! What animal would you be?

R: Boring. That's such a boring animal.

R: Well I would be a [turtle because then I wouldnt be afraid of anything. I'm strong enough to protect myself from any predator!] 

R: Knew it, I win this round. Now we're tied.

*Roomie yawns*

R: You feeling tired yet? Because I sure am... 

R: Uh, trivia time! Where was... the telephone invented?

R: It was Scotland! 

R: Next who was the 20th president of the United states?

R: It was- uh... wait a second

*Typing on a phone is heard* 

R: James Garfield! Wait, isn't he a cat? Ugh. Nevermind

R: What should we talk about now? 

*Typing on a phone is heard*

R: If you could only eat one type of food for the rest of your life, what would it be? 

R: What, that's cheating! You can't just say a sandwich! What kind of sandwich?

R: Well I would choose [potato, it can be made into many different foods like fries or potato waffles]

R: You are very annoying you know that? You remind me of my dog back at home. He is very yappy during the day but at night he just settles down and cuddles into you. It's quite cute actually

*A moment of silence before her heartrates speeds up slightly*

R: N- not that i think you're cute or anything! I'm just comparing you to my dog.

*There's another moment before her heart rate goes back to normal.*

R: This is nice, y'know? Being close with each other and talking about random stuff. We should do this more often. 

*There's yet another moment of silence*

R: Oh, you're asleep already. Did i really bore you that much? Well... sweet dreams.

*Roomie gives Listener a kiss on the forehead before yawning and going back to sleep herself*

(Audio can go on for a bit longer with just ambient noises as sleep aid or end here.)

It’s been really hard trying to move on, she was genuinely my best friend and I’ve never loved someone so much in my life. Long term goals weren’t the same and I’m not willing to compensate on where I want to be so I broke up with her (for other reasons too). We’ve been talking and hanging out occasionally, and I was already telling her we needed more distance gradually so we both can fully move on, but if it was okay with her, I’d like to remain friends. She was totally on board and wanted the same.

I’ve met a different girl who we get along fairly well. I’m not super super into her but right now we’re both on the terms that this is something super casual and we’re still getting to know one another (I’m keeping it exclusive with her and as far as I know, she’s doing the same). I recently told her about the situation with my ex after we were hanging out and my ex texted me (wasn’t exactly sure if she saw the text but I didn’t want to hide anything). She did not seem happy, at all, about it. We went out for some coffee and talked about it and essentially she said it has to be no contact whatsoever with my ex for us to work.

I understood. I haven’t been in many relationships tbh, but I knew keeping in contact or trying to be friends with exes is not fondly looked on. But I am so torn right now. I already had such a hard time letting go someone I’ve never been so compatible and loved so much, but now I have to lose them entirely even just as a friend? I’ve already spoken to my ex about the situation and she did say she would feel weird about it too if she was in the other girls shoes. She also broke down pretty hard saying she wasn’t ready to lose me entirely (but also mentioned she tried not thinking this way, but subconsciously she felt like she was waiting for me to potentially come back). 

We said our farewells, but I can’t help but feel this isn’t entirely fair and that I’m making a mistake just fully bending to what this new girl is asking. Is it really that absurd to want to remain friends? It’s only been a couple days, but I already regret going no contact. Are other women more understanding of this and maybe I should try meeting someone else, or is this going to be the same situation anyways?

**Edit: Didn’t mean GF, I should say new woman I’m speaking to now, which is something more casual for now.",2,1743297060.0,AITA_Relationships,8,1.0,False

As the price of coffee has increased so dramatically, I asked him to just make 1/2 pot at a time - as he usually only drinks about that much anyway.

Such a simple way to save money, but somehow this took us years to realize the waste.

Tonight at Shy’s Flash Bistro (what I call my home cooking).

A brown sugar cinnamon coffee rubbed filet migon w/ bordelaise to dip

Stuffed mushroom

And truffle Gouda broccoli

Created a new rub because my wife told me my usually is getting boring.

No formal measurements but it was: Salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, dash of montreal steak rub from McCormick, rosemary leaves, hand ground coffee, brown sugar, cinnamon. Rubbed on all sides and sat for 30 minutes at room temp.

Gas grilled - flipped every 6 minutes till 135 internal temp.

The crust was fucking amazing - crispy and so savory - but the internal was juicy and incredibly tender. Perfect moisture content.

I just had a kid with my wife but she after this meal has informed me she is ready for another.

The sides were good but nothing amazing. I used all my rizz on the steak.",0,1743296837.0,KitchenConfidential,11,0.42,False

I just signed the contract but now the impending doom of how I’m going to have to deal with people and make coffee’s. I feel like I’m already going to mess everything up and get fired within the first few weeks which feels embarrassing.
