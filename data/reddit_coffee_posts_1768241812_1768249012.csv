Weird?,"I'd been on 30mg for about 6 months and felt it super helpful in all the expected ways for Combined ADHD. Two weeks ago I discussed I was experiencing diminishing returns from the 30mg, and most notably restlessness and residual craving for stimulation still. Activation/focus was not enough and inconsistent, and I felt no therapeutically ""quieting the noise"" either.

So 2 weeks ago I went to 50mg (recommended by my doc) and the first week was wonderfully calm, clear, and capable, but now it's flipped. The activation and urgency are great, but 50mg revealed an insatiable internal pressure and anxiety, and despite doing everything I wanted to and getting so much done, I was feeling zero reward/satisfaction. I was getting more agitated/irritable too.

Overall made me think if Vyvanse for me at this dose felt over-pressurized above the shoulders (spiraling in my brain and also robotic), I'm super clear but wow anxious, and its wayyy outpacing any possible emotional regulation benefit I expected like the 1st week.

For this exact fatal flaw, I was curious if if Adderalll XR might allow for more physically (in the body) rewarding/calming activation versus provoking relentless internal pressure, becasue of its lower proportion of dextro- and instead 25% levo-amphetamine.

**Today I took a left-over Adderall 15mg from a couple of months ago, and I feel absolutely nothing. No activation, focus, no ""lift"" of onset. I took it on an empty stomach, no coffee. 3 hours later and I don't feel a thing! How does this make sense? I would feel 30mg of Vyvanse for more effective, even 20mg.**

I've taking an Adderall 10mg IR booster in the past (mid-day after morning Vyvanse), and that proved to be too much for me. It worked but with a lot of hyperfocus then trouble sleeping. My understanding also was that Adderall XR is more consistent than Vyvanse, less susceptible to like not working randomly.

1qb5oih,https://i.redd.it/yw17l02l6zcg1.jpeg,New machine,"Recently joined the Move club from a Barista Express. The Quality and consistency of espresso is a big step up for me but I still feel I can work on getting better coffee out of it. The biggest difference has been with lighter roasts. They used to often taste like a cup of vinegar with the Barista Express so I'm really enjoying this.

When it arrived it was faulty out the box with what seems to be quite a common problem in a recent batch (faulty power button). All credit to Espresso Coffee Shop who shipped a new one pretty quickly after the noted the issue. I think this is from newer batch (I had to wait until ECS received new stock from profitec) so hoping the issue doesn't happen again..

A couple of thoughts so far:

1. Pressure seems to be reaching 10 bar so need to adjust OBV valve. Anyone got any tips on how to do this?

2. My pucks are consistinatly coming out a little watery. I doubt it is my grinder (Option-o  Lagom Casa). To be honest, I dont think the coffee is impacted too much but I wonder if the basket should be holding a little more than 18g as it seems to be on large size. 

3. I am enjoying the 2 hole tip on steam wand. I feel 4 hole will make it feel much more rushed even if I save 5 seconds so keeping this for now. 

4. Finally, I have read that the machine takes 8-10 minutes to heat up. I have disabled fast heat up function and it still feels to be heating up pretty quickly. While I haven't timed it, it seems to reach 92 degrees under this time, while steamer takes a little longer to heat up. Has anyone else found that they have been impressed with heat up time? And is there any issue with making espresso even if steam boiler isn't up to temp, I assume not but not certain.

1qb5l3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePureContent/comments/1qb5l3o/embracing_modern_sophistication_a_new_era_of/,Embracing Modern Sophistication: A New Era of Elegance and Simplicity,"In today’s fast-paced world, the idea of sophistication has evolved. No longer defined by extravagant displays or complex designs, modern sophistication is all about embracing elegance through simplicity. It’s a lifestyle shift—one that blends minimalism, mindfulness, and intentional choices to create an elevated yet effortless way of living.

Here’s how embracing modern sophistication can transform your world:

# 1. Simplicity is the New Luxury

Gone are the days when luxury was equated with excess. Today, true elegance lies in simplicity. A clean space, a well-thought-out outfit, or a quiet morning with a cup of coffee can feel far more luxurious than a cluttered, over-the-top experience. It's about appreciating quality over quantity and finding joy in the little things.

# 2. Thoughtful Living Over Impulse

Modern sophistication encourages intentionality. It’s about making mindful decisions—whether it’s what you wear, how you decorate your home, or how you spend your time. Rather than rushing or following trends, it means slowing down and asking yourself, “Does this align with who I am?” That simple question changes everything.

# 3. Minimalism with Warmth

There’s a misconception that minimalism is cold or sterile. But in today’s world, it’s taking on a warmer tone. Think cozy textures, soft lighting, and neutral palettes that invite peace and clarity. Sophistication now means a space—or lifestyle—that feels calm, welcoming, and clutter-free.

# 4. Confidence in Subtlety

Sophistication isn’t about being loud—it’s about quiet confidence. It’s in the details: a tailored fit, a handwritten note, or a calm presence in a chaotic world. When you embrace simplicity, you allow your true self to shine, without the need for exaggeration.

# 5. Emotional Elegance

Modern sophistication isn’t just about the external; it’s internal too. It’s in how you carry yourself, how you treat others, and the way you approach life with grace. Being kind, patient, and empathetic is a form of elegance that never goes out of style.

Embracing modern sophistication is more than a trend—it’s a way of living that aligns with balance, intention, and authenticity. In a world that often demands more, choose less—but make it meaningful. That’s where true elegance lives.",1,1768248279.0,ThePureContent,0,1.0,False

I've seen GI doctors before. I had endoscopy and colonoscopy which is negative. The endoscopy was weird, they didn't take samples and said they saw ""something"" but didn't know what is it, so they shrugged it off. Every few months, I cough up blood small amounts of blood. They checked my lungs, all good. I had allergy IgE and IgG panels, everything negative. I also had MRI, CT and ultrasounds, nothing. Only histamine intolerance is positive but even following the diet, I'm not that well. I only eat fresh foods. 

Wheat gives me tremors and very hard to breath to the point I can barely breath and have to focus very hard not to pass out. It's very scary. Coffee also gave me symptoms like this. Milk gives me similar symptoms but mild. Even with ppi, lots of phlegm coming up. I have fluid build up in my calves all the time. I also have very bad brain fog and low energy. They did stool tests, sibo, lactose intolerance, fructose intolerance and so on. All negative.. Celiac was also negative and I don't eat gluten for a long time now. If I inhale wheat flour, my nose gets funny and I get bad symptoms. I don't consume wheat for a long time now, more than a year. 

I also have problem with protein consumption, no matter if it's chicken, beef, pork or beans, legumes, etc. Sometimes my kidneys hurt. Maybe it's that? I don't know.. I also have LUQ and RUQ stomach pain from time to time.

Quite some time has passed since I last shared areport with you guys in this forum. In the meantime, many of you have reached out to ask how I am doing (thank you for that!) and to encourage me to finally write another update. Today, I would like to comply with that request. Furthermore, today marks exactly two months since the first surgery! A perfect occasion for an update.

But first: why has it taken me so long to post again? Let me reassure you right away: it was not due to any bad complications or setbacks – on the contrary: I had already planned to publish a new diary entry about two weeks ago. Unfortunately, due to a moment of carelessness, I lost my almost completed draft ... As my posts are usually quite extensive, I don't write them in a single sitting as you can imagine but over a longer period of time, essentially by extending and iterating on them many times. Losing that draft meant that all the work and effort vanished in an instant. The frustration that followed drained my motivation for a while, and I struggled to start over from scratch. However, I have finally managed to gather enough motivation to bring you a new update on my journey. One important lesson has certainly been learned: from now on, I will always keep a backup copy.

As usualm I will begin with a brief summary of what has happened since my last contribution. To be completely honest, life is currently rather monotonous, hence, there have not been many dramatic developments. The most noteworthy events are probably the two consultations with Dr. Giotikas that have taken place since my previous update. I also finally have X-ray images that I can share with you. Additionally, a date for the second procedure has now been scheduled (04.02.2026), which is certainly worth discussing. In this post, I will also let you know whether I have decided on PRECISE or LATN for the tibia operation. Beyond that, I would like to give you an insight into my daily routine and share a few general reflections. I will also address my mental health and the effects of isolation. Finally, now that I have gained some practical experience, I would like (following a user's request) to offer a few tips on how best to prepare for this procedure.

# Chronology

By now, I have written several posts in this forum. To my surprise, some readers seem to have difficulty finding them via my profile. I don't know why to be honest. For clarity, I would therefore like to provide a brief chronology of my experience reports so far and the corresponding pointers:

I will continue this chronology in the following posts. In general, I believe it would be useful to collect the existing experience reports in a central location so that users can access them more easily. I am aware that efforts in this direction already exist, but they are not up to date.

# Lengthening Progress

First, I would like to provide an update on the current status of my lengthening progress. To that end, I am once again sharing the now familiar diagram that graphically summarizes my progress so far. As you can see, I have made several revisions to the original figure from previous posts. Since the diagram still appears to cause quite some confusion, I would like to explain its content in a bit more detail. (There are a few minor errors in the figure, but I haven't bothered fixing the bugs in the Python code yet.

https://preview.redd.it/nu8b0rewxycg1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7eab498e31e97aa9c4fc926606dfbcbb4805bcb

Unlike earlier versions, the date for the second surgery has now been firmly scheduled. This makes the projections regarding the overall timeline significantly more reliable. In addition, I have removed several distracting elements to improve the diagram's readability.

Overall, the diagram shows the achieved height gain as a function of time (days on the lower axis and weeks on the upper axis). The reddish area represents the expected progression under different assumptions about the distraction rate for femur, tibia and both together, ranging from very conservative (0.5 mm/day) to very optimistic (1.0 mm/day). The black lines show the actual measured values derived from the ERC device, while the markers are based on direct measurements from X-ray images (every marker also marks a consultation with Dr. Giotikas).

As is clearly visible, the resulting curve is (mostly) smooth and monotonic. The dashed/grey line most closely reflects my current height gain, as it also accounts for the initial distraction caused directly by the surgery. In the meantime, I have surpassed the five-centimeter mark, which is a major personal milestone for me.

I deliberately scheduled the second surgery (which I will discuss in more detail below) so that femoral lengthening will be largely completed by that time. I discussed this approach with my physiotherapist, who believes that rehabilitation will be considerably easier if we can focus exclusively on the tibia during physio. Dr. Giotikas has also agreed with this assessment. The surgery is scheduled for February 4. By then, I should have reached just under 7 cm, provided that I do not need to significantly reduce my current lengthening rate of approximately 0.8 mm per day.

A different protocol applies to tibial lengthening than to femoral lengthening. For the first ten days, the distraction rate is set at 1.0 mm/day to accommodate the natural reserve of the soft tissues and tendons. Afterward, the rate is reduced to 0.75 mm/day. For the tibia, I am planning a maximum lengthening of 3.5 cm, as complications such as Achilles tendon tightness or even contractures or the so-called ballerina feet syndrome tend to occur beyond this range, something I'm determined to avoid.

If everything proceeds smoothly, I should achieve an overall height increase of approximately 10 cm. Physically, I am in very good condition so far, although the isolation has been psychologically challenging. Under optimal circumstances, even 11 cm might be possible; however, I will pay close attention to my body's signals. I am not willing to sacrifice functionality for additional height.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the progression shown in the curve. Several interesting patterns can be observed too: the first 2 cm were achieved with a constant distraction rate of 1.0 mm/day, which is generally well tolerated due to the natural elasticity reserve of the tissues, resulting in minimal stiffness or tension. Beyond this point, I began to notice the first sensations of tightness, particularly at night. In response, I reduced the distraction rate until the symptoms subsided and my body had time to adapt to the anatomical changes. Naturally, this adaptation process takes longer as the lengthening progresses.

As the diagram shows, it was no longer possible to continue lengthening at the maximum distraction rate indefinitely. From around 3 cm onward, my body's signals became more pronounced, prompting me to experiment with different distraction rates in order to find an optimal balance, i.e., minimizing symptoms while maintaining the highest feasible rate of lengthening. At present, this rate is approximately 0.8 mm per day, which is still very good. At times, however, I have also incorporated periods of only 0.5 mm/day. In this respect, I remain deliberately flexible and just listen to my body.

Based on the current extrapolation (which is probably not final), the entire process should be completed in approximately three months. After that, I will likely need to remain in Athens for about three additional weeks to further strengthen my musculature. However, this should not pose any major difficulties.

# Why did I Undergo this Procedure?

I have already alluded to my wish to share the deeper reasons that led me to undergo this serious procedure. When people are asked why they choose such an operation, the answer is usually brief and superficial: ""I want to become taller."" Yet this explanation remains purely symptomatic. It offers no insight into the underlying forces that ultimately drive someone to make the decision to have their legs broken.

Through conversations with several other patients (both privately and here on the forum) it has become increasingly clear that these deeper reasons are often so heavily burdened with shame that many find it extraordinarily difficult to articulate them openly. Nevertheless, my initial impression has been reinforced: on a deeper psychological level, nearly everyone who undergoes this procedure is in a state of profound despair. There may be rare exceptions, perhaps individuals who have repressed the motivations for their actions so thoroughly that they can no longer consciously reflect on the psychological dynamics at work. I don't know.

One thing, however, remains certain: the stigma surrounding this operation will not diminish unless people are willing to make themselves emotionally transparent, at least to some extent. (On the other hand, maybe this surgery should remain stigmatized; I certainly cannot recommend it to anyone.) Only then can those who react with shock or disbelief begin to understand the personal tragedies and backgrounds that often underlie such decisions. With this post, I would like to make a small contribution toward that goal.

Writing down the full chain of events places a considerable emotional burden on me. For this reason, I do not wish to recount everything in detail again. Instead, I refer to a comment I recently wrote in response to another, partially strange post; one that was somewhat unusual, yet coincidentally touched precisely on this subject. You can find this contribution [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/limblengthening/comments/1pxcr28/comment/nwahugd/?context=3). I'm not sure whether I’ll write a dedicated post on the topic, as it requires a significant amount of energy. Owing to the nature of a comment, my thoughts there are necessarily condensed, material that could easily fill an entire book (and in fact, it did). For now, I hope it will suffice.

In this context, I would like to ask for one thing. I am fully aware that this is the internet, a space that encompasses the entire spectrum of human reactions. Even so, what I am sharing here is deeply personal in nature. I therefore ask that it be treated with respect, even if it provokes disagreement or discomfort. Everything can be discussed – of course –, but I ask for a certain degree of dignity, as very sensitive issues are involved. I'm not looking for sympathy or comfort. I share this experience, even though it shows me as weak and vulnerable, in the hope that it may give others hope, as it already has for some in private conversations.

For this reason, I explicitly ask that no malicious or spiteful remarks be directed at me and(!) at my former partner, whose behavior is directly causally connected to this procedure. Until now, my experiences in this forum have been overwhelmingly positive and I thank you all for that. The discussions have been thoughtful and respectful, and I sincerely hope that this continues. After all, there is something fundamental that unites all of us who are here.

# Tibia-to-Femur Ratio

In my first post, I mentioned that my tibia-to-femur ratio was initially unknown to me, although I assumed it to lie within the physiological normal range. Now that I have access to the relevant X-ray images, which allow this ratio to be determined, I would like to briefly address it here.

https://preview.redd.it/2hkadi4v5zcg1.jpg?width=176&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d1b541e22d64260de1f8437aec444617f1b187d

A short recap (for those unfamiliar with the topic, which comes up regularly on this forum) the tibia-to-femur ratio describes the length relationship between the tibia and the femur. In adults, it typically falls within a narrow physiological range of approximately 0.75 to 0.85. This ratio is biomechanically optimized and ensures efficient force transmission as well as balanced loading of the hip, knee and ankle joints.

If this ratio is altered substantially, muscular lever arms and joint forces shift, particularly at the knee. This can result in an inefficient gait, overuse symptoms, and long-term functional issues even when the bones themselves have healed anatomically correctly. Moreover, muscles and tendons have limited adaptability. Disproportionate lengthening, especially of the tibia, therefore increases the risk of soft-tissue tightness, Achilles tendon problems, contractures and degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis.

For these reasons, the tibia-to-femur ratio is not merely an aesthetic guideline (people her eoften mention it in the context of proportions) but a medically very relevant parameter. In the context of limb lengthening in particular, it serves as a key reference for balancing gains in height with long-term function and a physiological gait pattern.

As noted previously, my goal is to keep the tibia-to-femur ratio approximately constant, although this will not be perfectly achievable. The ratio is simply defined as r := T/F, with T/F being the length of the tibia/femur in arbitrary units, and can be determined directly from X-ray images. No absolute length calibration is required, as the ratio is dimensionless and any multiplicative scaling factors cancel out.

I performed several measurements, calculated the ensemble mean, and assumed that the uncertainties in T and F are not correlated (an assumption that is not strictly accurate but sufficient for this estimate). The resulting uncertainty is therefore given by the variance across the measurements. This yields a value of r \~ 0.81 ± 0.03, which represents a very favorable and unproblematic result.

To first order, changes in the ratio Δr are given by Δr \~ ΔT/T − ΔF/F, assuming that the length changes ΔT and ΔF are small compared to the initial lengths (ΔT, ΔF << T, F). To keep the ratio approximately constant (Δr \~ 0), the following condition must therefore hold ΔT/ΔF \~ T/F.

Using illustrative baseline values from the X-ray above of F \~ 690 px (in pixels) for the Femur and T \~ 551 px for the tibia (not high-precision measurements ...) and assuming a femoral lengthening of ΔF \~ 7 cm, this would imply a tibial lengthening of ΔT \~ 5.6 cm. I will not pursue this; instead, I have set a maximum target of 3.5 cm (maybe 4 cm at max) for the tibia. While this results in a moderate reduction of the tibia-to-femur ratio, it remains well within a range that I consider acceptable and functionally sound.

# Second Consultation

I have already described the first consultation with Dr. Giotikas in sufficient detail in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/limblengthening/comments/1plqbd8/quadrilateral_limb_lengthening_with_dr_giotikas_1/), and anyone interested is encouraged to refer back to that account. Here, I will simply provide a brief summary of the consultation process.

Consultations typically take place every two to three weeks. Their primary purpose is to allow Dr. Giotikas to assess the patient's current condition and progress and, if necessary, to intervene early should any complications arise, something that is absolutely critical in limb lengthening. It is important to recognize that limb lengthening differs fundamentally from other cosmetic procedures: over the course of several months, the patient works very closely with the surgeon and relies on continuous cooperation as well as a solid interpersonal relationship. Therefore, it is better to choose a surgeon with whom you also connect on a personal level.

For these consultationsm we are usually picked up by our lovely driver (we have become good friend) and taken to the Mediterraneo hospital where the surgery was performed. Each trip costs 22 euros. Upon arrival, X-ray images are taken and subsequently reviewed in person with Dr. Giotikas. Based on these images, he determines the current degree of bone distraction. He also inspects the internal intramedullary nails for any signs of deformation and/or bending and evaluates the quality of the callus as well as overall bone regeneration. If any abnormalities are observed, a reduction in the distraction rate is usually required.

In addition, Dr. Giotikas evaluates the patient's general physical condition. He assesses flexibility and range of motion and performs various measurements to quantify potential muscle mass loss. He also asks for quality of sleep etc. Based on this comprehensive assessment, he then recommends the protocol for the following two to three weeks, e.g., adjusting the distraction rate from 1.0 mm/day to 0.8 mm/day or something like this. Afterward, there is sufficient time to address open questions and discuss various aspects of the treatment. There is usually room for a few light-hearted moments as well.

The following images show the X-ray scans from the second consultation. The images were taken from two different perspectives.

https://preview.redd.it/63yp9yy40zcg1.jpg?width=397&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdaadbdd165ee748eecd3b69fa2585011173f739

As can be seen, callus formation is still relatively modest, although early signs are already visible. In response to my inquiry, Dr. Giotikas explained that these findings are entirely within the expected range and that at this stage of distraction, a clearly pronounced callus is not yet to be expected. What we are seeing is therefore completely average. This explanation was reassuring to me.

By the way, the quality of the X-rays is very poor because I took photos of them with my phone while discussing them with Dr. Giotikas. Sorry for that.

# Third Consultation

The third consultation followed the same structure as the first two, consisting of X-ray imaging followed by a detailed review and adjustment of the distraction protocol. As is clearly visible in the images, the distraction has progressed significantly, and callus formation is developing very well. Here you see the anterior–posterior view:

https://preview.redd.it/rg57m0hf0zcg1.jpg?width=321&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b98797a4c09a95ab0ee1ac044d825f2973a6ac0

And here you see the lateral view:

https://preview.redd.it/mk1d1li60zcg1.jpg?width=409&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b95a7764869b9c8859d251c9af37c028b6f78aaf

One of the images illustrates how Dr. Giotikas determines the current extent of the lengthening. Both the size of the distraction gap and the intramedullary nail are measured in arbitrary units, after which the known diameter of the nail (12.5 mm in my case) is used for calibration.

Overall, Dr. Giotikas was very satisfied with the progress. My flexibility remains excellent, and pain or stiffness is virtually non-existent. And since everything has been proceeding according to plan, Dr. Giotikas and I discussed the next steps regarding the second surgery, which I will address in the following section in more detail.

I have discussed the general outline of the second procedure with Dr. Giotikas. As I mentioned previously, attaching the external frames is considerably less invasive than inserting an internal intramedullary nail. For that reason, the operation will be performed while I am awake using spinal anaesthesia, which suits me perfectly. You may recall my rather traumatic experience following the first surgery, when I spent five consecutive days vomiting due to the anesthesia. I am more than happy to avoid a repeat of that ordeal.

During our conversation, I made a somewhat … unconventional request. I asked Dr. Giotikas whether I might be allowed to observe the entire procedure because I'm curious to watch it. The instant the words left my mouth, his facial expression made me laugh: it was an extraordinary mix of surprise, amusement and mild horror and the question: is that guy serious?. Probably no patient had ever made such a request before. For a brief moment, he was entirely speechless, unsure how to respond. His initial answer was therefore a clear and unequivocal no.

Naturally, I couldn't leave it at that. I proceeded to tell him an anecdote from my early adolescence: At around fourteen, I had to undergo a circumcision due to a phimosis. While lying on the operating table, a surgical drape was raised to block my view. Curious, I told the doctor that I would very much like to watch the procedure. He laughed and assured me that this was, of course, impossible. What he hadn't accounted for, however, was his significantly impaired eyesight and the exceptionally large glasses he wore because of it. In their lenses, the entire operation was perfectly reflected, crystal clear and at close range. I was able to observe the procedure in its entirety without anyone noticing, and I was thoroughly satisfied.

I also told Dr. Giotikas that once all of this madness is finally over, I intend to start my life new and study medicine in Germany. After a brief moment of consideration, he said he might be willing to pull the curtain aside at certain points and explain what he was doing. That genuinely made me very happy. Of course, I now secretly hope to be able to observe the entire procedure. My curiosity is barely containable. I'm practically bursting with anticipation.

# Second Surgery (04.02.2026)

The second surgery is scheduled for February 4, marking the next major step in the process.

As mentioned in my first post (I'll just repeat some content here), Dr. Giotikas offers several limb-lengthening options, including PRECICE(-2.2), G/Guichet intramedullary nails, Taylor Spatial Frames (TSF), and LATN (i.e., TSF followed by insertion of an intramedullary trauma nail once the consolidation phase begins). The external options are applicable only for tibial lengthening.

I spent a considerable amount of time weighing these options. Initially, financial considerations made the PRECICE system more attractive, although this advantage has largely disappeared since the manufacturer significantly increased prices as you know. I was also drawn to the theoretical possibility of reversing the nail if necessary or using techniques such as the accordion method during lengthening to stimulate osteogenesis, although I am unsure how often this is actually implemented in practice. For these reasons, and because I wanted to minimize the amount of bone reaming, I ultimately decided against the G-Nail system.

Pure TSF frames were never a serious option for me of course, as I had no desire to remain in an external frame throughout the entire consolidation phase, which takes quite long for tibias. Such purely external approaches are more commonly used for deformity correction rather than cosmetic or proportional lengthening.

In the end, I was left with two combinations:

* PRECICE (femur) + PRECICE (tibia)
* PRECICE (femur) + LATN (tibia) \[hybrid approach\]

After extensive discussions with Dr. Giotikas, I made a final decision in favor of the second option.

The primary advantage of the LATN approach is that after tibial lengthening with an external fixator, the bone is stabilized with an intramedullary trauma nail, allowing for immediate weight-bearing. This is a crucial consideration, as tibial lengthening is expected to begin roughly two months after femoral lengthening now, and tibias generally heal more slowly. Without LATN, this would significantly prolong the overall consolidation phase for me and limit my maneuverability.

Here you can see an image of a Taylor Spatial Frame for those who don't know how it looks:

https://preview.redd.it/nsi8ahxm0zcg1.jpg?width=236&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e7b4f787fcb1cd937074998ed0bf9c07510e073

and how it is applied to the tibia:

https://preview.redd.it/d37vwc4q0zcg1.jpg?width=151&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bf462691894a271834d7e279888c6604847b961

I know, I know: it may look quite brutal (like a medieval torture device), but it is one of the most effective and well-studied methods in trauma orthopedics. The device used for limb lengthening differs from the model shown in the images above. I'll share pictures once I'm carrying those monsters on my legs.

Financial considerations also played an important role here. Following the manufacturer's considerable price increase, the cost of the PRECICE package rose by roughly 7000 euro per segment. Fortunately, I had secured/locked the femoral procedure with a deposit; otherwise, the total additional cost would have been 14000 euro. Since the LATN package costs approximately 40,000 euro, this option represents substantial savings compared to quadrilateral PRECICE tibial lengthening.

Another advantage is that using an external frame during the second stage of quadrilateral limb lengthening may help with pain management during the distraction phase, as it does not require bone reaming and therefore places less systemic stress on the body. This benefit is, of course, lost once the trauma nail is inserted, but by that point the distraction phase has already been completed.

The main disadvantages are equally clear: having to tolerate an external fixator during callus distraction, the risk of pin-site infections, potential scarring and the need for an additional surgery to remove the frame and insert the trauma nail.

That said, since my goals for tibial lengthening are relatively modest, scar formation should remain within acceptable limits. In particular, the unsightly raised scars reportedly tend to occur mainly with lengthenings exceeding approximately 4 cm. I have also met a patient here who underwent tibial lengthening using an external fixator, and in his case the scarring was quite manageable.

# Other Changes

As one my fellow patients here in Athens, SearchForSymmetry, already mentioned in a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/limblengthening/comments/1q6ig82/dr_giotikas_new_physio_center_just_opened_today/), quite a few things have changed over the turn of the year. The physiotherapy center where we receive treatment three times a week has relocated and now presents itself in a noticeably more modern setting. For comparison, images of the old therapy center can be found in [earlier posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/limblengthening/comments/1p44t6v/quadrilateral_limb_lengthening_with_dr_giotikas/).

I must admit (at the risk of sounding like a whiner) that I actually preferred the previous facility. The new one is defined primarily by its modern design and a very sterile atmosphere, whereas the old center was largely characterized by a certain degree of chaos and improvisation. The latter aligns much more closely with my own nature I'd say. I do not enjoy sterile, bloodless environments; they make me feel as though I am in a machine room devoid of any sense of humanity. Unfortunately, that is no longer something I can change.

# Pain and Mental Health

Overall, I consider myself very fortunate, as I belong to the rare group of patients who have largely been spared severe pain throughout this entire process (so far at least). Apart from the first three to four weeks, when postoperative pain predominated, my overall pain levels have been very low. As my height has increased, some bodily tension is of course noticeabl, but even this has remained well within manageable limits for me.

My treating physiotherapist has told me that I am one of the most flexible patients he has ever worked with. (Sometimes he stretches me so much that I want to scream, but I usually just grit my teeth; physiotherapy can be very painful.) Even after five centimeters of lengthening, I have experienced hardly any loss of range of motion, which is quite rare. In addition, I have so far been completely spared the much-feared nerve pain. Whether this is due to pure luck or a particular anatomical predisposition cannot be determined with certainty. However, I began intensive preventive nerve-gliding exercises very early on, in the hope of reducing the risk of nerve irritation. Whether the absence of nerve pain can be attributed to these exercises or was simply a matter of chance cannot be clearly disentangled in hindsight.

That said, I want to emphasize explicitly that no one should extrapolate my experience to their own case. One of the most common questions I'm asked concerns the level of pain to be expected. Often, it can be reduced to the following statement: ""I want to undergo the surgery, but my fear of pain is holding me back."" To this, I can only say very clearly that it is almost impossible to predict how pain will be experienced by any individual during this process. Pain is highly individual, multifactorial and largely subjective. It is no coincidence that there is no objective measure of pain but only subjective scales.

I prepared very thoroughly for this procedure, read numerous personal accounts and spoke with many other patients. When it comes to pain, the full spectrum was represented: from virtually pain-free to pain at the limits of tolerance lasting for months. Anyone considering this procedure must therefore be aware that pain remains an unknown variable till the moment you actually do it. One piece of advice I'd give you: expect to be unable to work for at least one and a half months.

That said, there are certain factors that I personally believe influence pain perception. Pain is not solely a direct response to tissue damage but is strongly modulated by central nervous system processing, psychological context, and prior experience. I am convinced that pain resilience tends to increase with age, partly due to cumulative exposure to painful stimuli and improved cognitive coping strategies. In this sense, something similar to a “pain memory” appears to exist: nociceptive experiences are interpreted relative to previously experienced pain rather than in isolation. Individuals who have endured periods of significant pain or prolonged suffering earlier in life may therefore be better equipped to contextualize, regulate and tolerate the pain associated with this procedure.

In my case, I have suffered from very bad cluster headaches since early childhood, which are considered among the most extreme pain experiences a human can endure. In addition, I experienced two episodes of myocarditis, during which inflammation of the heart triggered actual heart attacks, which are also extremely painful events. My former girlfriend used to playfully bite my skin, and she was surprised and amused that I apparently did not feel any pain. I believe these experiences contributed significantly to my perception of the pain associated with this procedure as comparatively moderate. I also think psychological distress plays an important role: the greater the suffering caused by one's initial situation (like suffering under your height) and the stronger the perceived promise of relief associated with the procedure, the more tolerable the pain may feel. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized once again that outcomes vary greatly, and there are fellow patients who have suffered considerably.

What affects me far more than the physical pain is the isolation. My current situation is extremely unfamiliar to me. In the past, I spent very little time within my own four walls and was almost constantly on the move. (In retrospect, that probably was pathological as well.) I spent most of my free time in bars or cafés; my apartment was essentially just a place to sleep and shower. Being forced now to spend the majority of my day inside an apartment is therefore very challenging for me. So far, I have not developed a truly effective coping strategy.

That said, I have a very good relationship with our driver, with whom I occasionally go out to eat or have a coffee. I am incredibly grateful for this, as it helps me a great deal. Otherwise, I spend a lot of time cooking, something I practically never did before (I lived almost my entire adult life without a refrigerator). At the moment, I’m even trying my hand at fairly ambitious dishes, a skill my future partner will certainly appreciate. The daily stretching exercises also take up a significant amount of time. I spend most of the remaining day reading, which has always been one of my greatest passions. In the past, however, I usually read in public spaces such as bars or cafés, as solitude never suited me well. Now, I am forced into isolation.

I find comfort in the thought that this situation is finite and foreseeable, and that once all of this is over, I will have the opportunity to begin a new life.

# Some Preoperative Preparation

As I have now gained a solid understanding of the entire process, I would like to outline a few preoperative measures that I found particularly helpful in preparing for this procedure.

First and foremost, the importance of stretching exercises can hardly be overstated. As I mentioned in my first post, they serve not only to improve flexibility and increase range of motion, but also to condition the brain to tolerate sustained stretching discomfort. This aspect should never be underestimated. It is worth keeping in mind that flexibility is a complex process influenced not only by the physical elasticity of the tissues, but also (often decisively) by neurological mechanisms. I personally followed a very intensive preoperative stretching regimen. Typically, I performed demanding stretching exercises for about two hours every day over a period of roughly three months. In retrospect, this was clearly excessive. In my view, thirty minutes to a maximum of one hour per day is more than sufficient as preparation for this procedure.

One of the greatest challenges following the surgery (and for several weeks thereafter!) is getting decent sleep. Sleeping can be extremely difficult to get, both because of the pain and because most people are unaccustomed to sleeping on their backs. During the first months after the procedure, it is generally impossible to sleep on one's stomach or side. I attempted this after one week, and the pain quite literally brought tears to my eyes. Anticipating this issue (because it was mentioned in many reports), I had begun training myself to sleep on my back several weeks prior to the surgery. This helped to some extent and was certainly beneficial, yet – I won't lie to you – the experience remained utterly miserable.

Another practical but often underestimated aspect of preparation is familiarization with assistive devices. Crutches, walkers, or wheelchairs may appear straightforward, but using them efficiently over prolonged periods is surprisingly demanding especially if you are in pain. Practicing transfers (for example, bed to chair or chair to toilet), navigating narrow spaces, and learning how to distribute weight correctly can significantly reduce frustration and fatigue after surgery when pain and weakness impair coordination. Also, you have to do a lot of dips when you move around. Therefore, if you have weak arms, I'd recommend practicing this movement, specifically, lifting your own body weight.

Beyond this, mental preparation and expectation management play a decisive role. Limb lengthening is not merely a surgical intervention but a prolonged psychological challenge. As mentioned above, this is now the hardest part for me. Pain, immobility, boredom and slow progress can test even the most resilient individuals. I found it helpful to anticipate difficult moments such as painful physiotherapy sessions or sleepless nights and to accept them in advance as inevitable rather than exceptional. This mindset reduced emotional distress when these situations inevitably occurred.

Optimizing general health and nutrition prior to surgery is another important consideration. Ensuring adequate protein intake, sufficient caloric consumption and appropriate levels of key micronutrients (particularly vitamin D, calcium, magnesium and iron) can support bone regeneration and tissue healing. Any preexisting deficiencies should ideally be identified and corrected well before the procedure, rather than addressed reactively during recovery. I did blood tests prior to the surgery to check if I have any deficits. I, for instance, was not used to cooking prior to the surgery. Usually, I would just grab something quickly and eat it on the go. This is not possible when you undergo this surgery. You need a proper schedule, and you have to plan your meals. If you mess up your diet, you increase the risk of delayed union or even nonunion.

Keep in mind that many aspects of limb lengthening are beyond your control such as genetics and other biological factors. Controlling your diet is one of the parameters you do have control over. Use this and make the best of it.

It is also advisable to plan in advance how you intend to spend your time during recovery. I brought my violin with me to Greece so that I could continue playing, as well as an e-book-reader loaded with numerous books. I also made a conscious effort to engage more deeply with biochemical topics and to prepare for my new course of study after the surgery. I also want to finish some coding projects. Do not allow this time to pass by unused.

To all the limb lengthening veterans here, please feel free to add additional measures in the comments, as this list is, of course, by no means exhaustive.

# Closing Words

As always, thank you for taking the time to read this post. Recently, one user complained on the length and level of detail in my posts and comments, and I could hardly disagree. Even back in school – I told this guy–, my teachers encouraged me to be more concise, both in speech and in writing. That, however, is a skill I never truly mastered. One teacher even joked that I should consider becoming a wandering preacher. I hope you are patient and understanding with me.

Nevertheless, I hope this post was informative and perhaps even a little entertaining. As I have emphasized before, it is important to me to offer as realistic glimpse as possible into the entire process, so that anyone considering this major procedure can form an authentic understanding of what it entails.

I remain open to all forms of criticism and am always happy to answer questions. Even at the risk of repeating myself, I invite you to let me know if there are specific topics, question or suggestions you would like me to address. I will gladly take them into account.

That's all for today. When I write my next post, I will no longer have two, but a total of six broken bones in my body (two femurs, two tibias and two fibulas), and heavy frames will be weighing down my legs. For our u/[I-696](https://www.reddit.com/user/I-696/), will also once again have the pleasure of experiencing a catheter, which I'll report here in all detail of course. I will check in again then. As always: stay tuned.

Until then: all the best and see you very soon!

I lost my PCP last year and have been waiting months for a new PCP only to find out my insurance changed and I basically need to start over. I don’t mind waiting, but here’s the thing…. I’m currently unmedicated for my ADHD and shit is TOUGH. I’m dissociating HARD and my depression is flaring up on top of other co-occurring conditions I have (it’s also PMDD time yay). It’s EXTREMELY hard for me to gain any momentum and nothing is helping. I’m shutting down EVERY. DAY.

 

My therapist is helping me find someone for medication management and has been supporting me, but I need ideas for gaining momentum (or trying to) in the interim. I’ll try anything. I’m so desperate.

\- Music helps to an extent, but listening to it 24/7 can be overstimulating (my tolerance is extremely low right now)

\- I’ve been trying to indulge in things I enjoy, but that’s not really attainable for me at this time

\- Meditation for regulation (and in different ways), but I can’t focus enough to maintain it

\- Healing through healthy foods, but I’m having a hard time cooking (bless frozen foods) or I just straight up forget/don’t feel like eating because I feel like poop

\- Drinking caffeine (coffee/tea) and eating chocolate when I feel like a zombie that needs reviving, but it always makes me tired AF (not really ideal)

\- Going for a walk/getting air/general movement, but I end up dissociating and the feeling is so fucked up it just makes me more sad

\- My friends/family are supportive, but everyone has their own lives so I feel like I haven’t seen anyone in ages

Not only am I suffering, but my plants are too and I feel so awful. My brain, body, and soul are just like nope. Again, I’ll literally try anything. Tell me the weirdly wonderful things/hacks that work for you because I’m currently at a loss.

Hello.
I've been trying for the past like 3 years to get a game started with this setting. I think im just gonna give it one final try.

I'm usually a GM in DnD but this will be more free form narrative based youll be able to ask to do basically anything as long as it makes sense but that also makes it vital to understand what you can do, so there might be a lot of learning and questions asked on both sides . 

I have crafted this setting from the ground up, history, technology, factions and people. There are heavy influences from media i enjoy but i feel like ive brought enough novel input to make this a unique experience for people craving a more realistic take on the Cyberpunk genre.

I tend to obsess over details, craft and think and delve into my own imagination to create these places and the lives of the people inhabiting them but there's no meaning if there's no one to witness them. So i need real people to walk the streets , see the sights and get lost in the narative with me.

I will work with you on a character, exactly as you want them to be, rooted within the world to the best of my abilities. We will work together on a story you feel like expressing and then I'll set you free in a world of possibilities. Action, drama, subterfuge, highs and lows all at your fingertips as long as you're willing to look for them. I am very much the kind of DM that expects my players to be equal participants in telling the story , i will not railroad, force missions etc. I will make hooks , i will do my best to create opportunities but i need my players to be proactive in attempting to follow the story. This wont work if you try to turn your decision making off and play along.

Now , enough of that. Perhaps it is time to give you a taste of what life in my world is like through the eyes of a humble character. (And a bit of my writing, but do not worry, its my job as a GM to write long shit players can have shorter replies)

=======================

Mikail is a city police officer. His job used to involve maintenance on the robotic drones that patrol the inner city, but since the new overseer mark3 he's been left on wall duty.

""Perhaps it's for the best"" he thinks for himself, stepping over the rattling walkways precariously pinned to the outside of the massive structure. He sighs softly while looking down at the sheet metal face of the wall, the rusting rivets holding down all the poor patch jobs added throughout the years, threatening to pop at the slightest suggestion of force.

His job is simple, do rounds , make sure none of the Slumers try to get past the wall. He knows he's supposed to call them ""outer citizens"" and perhaps some of them deserve that distinction but anyone dumb enough to try to scale the wall is below that title in his mind. He stops for a second to think about what he's going to have for lunch, that cute barista from the place he frequents comes to mind but he's not going to ask her out. Not yet , maybe when he makes captain. So he settles for passing by there for another coffee as the sound of a gunshot echoes out and snaps him back to attention. 

He looks down to see a man slumped over on the ground right under him, being patted down by who clearly was the shooter. His instinct is to call a medical drone but he remembers being yelled at twice for interfering with ""outer citizen politics"" and proceeds with his rounds. 

He looks out at the vast buildings sprawling out in front of him, this new burst of construction in the outer city is intimidating, "" Command  , you sure block C4-22 is authorized for construction above 50 floors?"" he asks, receiving the same response they've always given. A firm yes, citing that it's far enough from the wall to not cause an issue. He keeps walking...

This is Mikail's life. Constantly on the edge of two worlds. One one side the inner city, white, clean, tidy, safe.On the other , filling his mind day and night the outer city, where every color of the rainbow lives, thrives or struggles, where cops get to go on patrol, where people need the help he cannot give, where everything he thinks he wants is, but her just goes back home.

1qb555w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1qb555w/list_of_my_symptoms/,List of my symptoms,"A. COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL SYMPTOMS (The Mind)

1. Intense and irrational fear of dying or an imminent catastrophe.
2. Obsessive thoughts about serious diseases (cancer, brain tumors).

4. Sudden and invasive catastrophic thoughts.
5. Constant rumination (uncontrollable cycle of thoughts).
6. Difficulty trusting one's own well-being, despite the evidence.
7. Anticipatory anxiety (fear of fear).
8. Thought of losing control or ""doing crazy"".
9. Feeling of hopelessness (""I won't be able to live like this"").
10. Affective flattening/Anhedonia: Not feeling happiness or sadness, deep boredom (associated with the beginning of Sertraline + THC withdrawal).
11. Feeling of despair and intense burden.

B. PHYSICAL AND NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS

1. Cardiovascular and Respiratory:

· Tachycardia (accelerated heartbeat, confirmed as perception by normal ECG).

· Palpitations or sensation of strong heartbeat (also perceived in the ears).

· Tightness/heaviness in the left chest (no stabbing pain).

· Altered breathing (superficial, through the mouth, or feeling of not filling the lungs).

2. Sensory and Head Neurological:

· Dizziness or stunning.

· Feeling of ""disconnection"" or imminent fainting.

· ""Echo"" or reverberation in the head (mental hypervigilance/brain fatigue).

· Oppressive band-type headache (tension headache).

· Constant pressure/discomfort in the head and forehead (specifically in the hairline).

· Sensation of ""sunken eyes"", heaviness or eye pressure.

· Strange, blurred or altered vision in front of screens (visual fatigue + derealization).

4. Vegetative and General:

· Sweating (especially on hands).

· Chills.

· Nausea.

· Feeling of weakness or generalized body laziness.

· Extreme and visible physical fatigue.

· Internal trembling or vibration sensation.

C. DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS (Mind-Body Disconnection)

1. Derealization: The world feels unreal, dreamlike, or like ""float"".
2. Depersonalization: Feeling of not being yourself, of observing yourself from the outside.
3. Body hypervigilance: Constant scan of internal sensations (beats, noises, vibrations).
4. Feeling of bodily unreality (parts of the body do not feel their own).

\---

D. MODULATING FACTORS (Identified by you)

THE SYMPTOMS CLEARLY WORSEN WITH:

· THC consumption (and its withdrawal, currently in progress).

· Caffeine consumption (confirmed with coffee).

· Lack of sleep.

· Ruminative and anticipatory thoughts.

· Prolonged exposure to screens (rare vision, headache).

· Start of treatment with Sertraline (initial adjustment phase, common the first days/weeks).

KEY CURRENT CONTEXT (TEMPORARY AGGRAVATING FACTORS):

· Day 12 of THC withdrawal (possible peak of withdrawal symptoms: anxiety, anhedonia, emotional dysregulation).

· 12 days of treatment with Sertraline (frequent initial increase in anxiety, restlessness and affective flattening before improvement).

· Medical safety confirmation: Normal ECG (sinus rhythm at 80 lpm), which rules out organic cardiac origin of the symptoms.",1,1768247314.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

The ceiling above Larry’s bed was cracked and peeling, a slow vein of decay crawling across its surface. Morning light bled through his paper-thin curtains, spilling a pale, indifferent glow onto the cluttered floor. Scattered notebooks. A cracked game controller. An old hoodie crumpled like shed skin.

The silence wasn’t unusual. It was routine. Sterile.

He stared at the ceiling for a long while, trying not to look at the clock. It was better not to know how long he’d been awake. His stomach growled, forcing him to move. His body ached the way it always did after sleeping in that bed, the springs pressing into his ribs like rusted fingers.

When he sat up, his eyes drifted to the calendar.

A dragon sticker, faded and peeling, was stuck to today’s date.

DECEMBER 6 — BIRTHDAY.

He waited.

No voice from the kitchen. No smell of pancakes. No sound of anyone remembering.

Eventually, he wandered down the hall. His sock caught on a nail sticking up from the splintered floorboard, and he hissed as he pulled it free. He passed the kitchen, slowing with a stupid flicker of hope.

Two plates sat in the sink. Cold, crusted with egg. The coffee pot was half-full. Still warm.

They’d gone out for breakfast.

Without him.

His mother’s jacket was gone from the hook. Her heels were missing from the mat. A pink sticky note clung to the fridge, but it was just a coupon for laundry detergent.

He checked his phone.

No messages.

Not even from Chase.

Larry stood in the dull green light of the kitchen, staring at the empty chairs. One had his mother’s hairbrush resting on the seat. The other had a folded takeout napkin. They hadn’t even tried to hide it.

He poured himself a cup of lukewarm coffee. It was bitter. They didn’t add sugar anymore.

He opened the fridge.

Milk. A takeout box. Half a stick of butter. A bag of grapes.

No cake.

No card.

Nothing with his name on it.

He shut the fridge too hard.

The silence pressed closer.

It wasn’t the first time they forgot.

But it was the first time it hurt this much.

⸻

School passed like a blur of lockers and noise and people who never saw him.

Chase did.

Only not the way Larry needed.

Chase laughed with Jax. Smiled with him. Slapped shoulders and blended in like he’d never been anything else.

“Chase,” Larry called.

Chase turned.

For one fragile moment, Larry thought he’d say something.

Instead, Chase gave him a polite, distant nod. Like a stranger.

And turned away.

⸻

By the time Larry came home, the house already smelled wrong.

Cigarettes. Grease. Stale television laughter.

Greg sat in his recliner like a bloated king.

“You gonna just stand there like a statue?” he said.

Larry swallowed. “Where’s Mom?”

“Work. That thing people do.”

Greg’s smile was sharp. “What are you now, seventeen? Eighteen?”

“Seventeen.”

“Well congratu-fuckin-lations. Only one year left before I don’t have to look at your leech-ass face.”

Larry didn’t speak.

“Go on,” Greg continued. “Do everyone a favor and get out of my sight.”

So Larry did.

He lay on his bed in the dark, staring at the cracked ceiling.

And something in his chest began to burn.

At first, he thought it was panic.

Then it got worse.

A pulse throbbed beneath his ribs. Then another. Heat spread through his spine, into his throat, into his bones.

His body arched.

A sharp pop cracked inside his chest.

He screamed.

His bones shifted.

Not growing.

Reshaping.

His ribcage tightened. His spine bent. His hips twisted with a wrenching snap that stole his breath.

His skin rippled.

His hair spilled down his back, long and dark.

His throat constricted, reshaping the sound of him.

He tried to cry out, but what came out was higher. Thinner.

Wrong.

He slid off the bed, crawling toward the dresser.

The mirror waited.

A girl stared back.

Raven hair. Violet eyes. A face too soft to be his.

A face that was hers.

The scream tore out of her before she could stop it.

Footsteps thundered downstairs.

The door flew open.

“Larry, are you—”

Her mother froze.

“Where’s my son?”

The girl tried to speak.

“I’m right here.”

Her mother screamed.

And the girl ran.

Finally decided on half of a small shake for some calories and it just opened up a wave of either throwing up, or being close to it. 

I feel like shit and if I ever throw up it makes me scared to eat because it might happen again as it often does for me or my stomach does the flips for what feels like forever. 

So far today I had a basic garden salad, protein shake (half), beef broth (again half but plan to go back to it soon when stomach calms down) with some chia seeds, and coffee with honey. Plus lots of water and soda. (It’s a regional thing here that people believe the mostly Michigan brand of ginger ale, vernors, helps you when you’re throwing up and old habits die hard) 

I just feel terrible that it’s almost 3pm now and I haven’t eaten anything. I worked so hard all year and gained 20 pounds and I know that my appetite is going to be messed up when I get better and I have to work all over again bringing it back up.

1qb4wcs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qb4wcs,[Review] TWT Cold Coffee [OC],"Bought it from BB, last week when they offer the deals post-midnight. The sub has been informing it every now and then. 

So, decided to sacrifice good night’s sleep on last weekend and placed the order.

**Packaging’s functionality** - The zip lock is solid. It clicks, literally. 

**Mixability** - I mixed it in shaker, blender, even hand-stirred to check the claims. You can definitely stir it-to-make it, let alone shakers and blenders. 

**Taste** - This is a hard pass. Before consuming TWT cold coffee, I was taking Yogabar’s Unflavoured(Smytten deal) and tbh the first thing that hits your nose and palate is the unflavoured’s pungent smell and taste(not that intense but yes) and then may be, a little bit of coffee mid way(won’t say at last) but too mild. 

Coffee is 5.4%(not that low). 

*Few things that I figured out to make it slightly better:*
1. Keep the water/milk quantity lower than usual (I take 150ml of water per scoop)
2. ⁠Add flavours or extra instant coffee. You guys know it better. 

**Digestion** - This is by far the lightest protein I have ever consumed. 

Provided, I have only consumed wheys in which Conc was the primary source. This has Iso as primary source. 

Tried to make it as simple and transparent as it could be. What I felt that there is some substance to this product, and not just marketing fluff.

They’d gone out for breakfast.

Without him.

His mother’s jacket was gone from the hook. Her heels were missing from the mat. A pink sticky note clung to the fridge, but it was just a coupon for laundry detergent.

He checked his phone.

No messages.

Not even from Chase.

Larry stood in the dull green light of the kitchen, staring at the empty chairs. One had his mother’s hairbrush resting on the seat. The other had a folded takeout napkin. They hadn’t even tried to hide it.

He poured himself a cup of lukewarm coffee. It was bitter. They didn’t add sugar anymore.

He opened the fridge.

Milk. A takeout box. Half a stick of butter. A bag of grapes.

No cake.

No card.

Nothing with his name on it.

He shut the fridge too hard.

The silence pressed closer.

It wasn’t the first time they forgot.

But it was the first time it hurt this much.

⸻

School passed like a blur of lockers and noise and people who never saw him.

Chase did.

Only not the way Larry needed.

Chase laughed with Jax. Smiled with him. Slapped shoulders and blended in like he’d never been anything else.

“Chase,” Larry called.

Chase turned.

For one fragile moment, Larry thought he’d say something.

Instead, Chase gave him a polite, distant nod. Like a stranger.

And turned away.

⸻

By the time Larry came home, the house already smelled wrong.

Cigarettes. Grease. Stale television laughter.

Greg sat in his recliner like a bloated king.

“You gonna just stand there like a statue?” he said.

Larry swallowed. “Where’s Mom?”

“Work. That thing people do.”

Greg’s smile was sharp. “What are you now, seventeen? Eighteen?”

“Seventeen.”

“Well congratu-fuckin-lations. Only one year left before I don’t have to look at your leech-ass face.”

Larry didn’t speak.

“Go on,” Greg continued. “Do everyone a favor and get out of my sight.”

So Larry did.

He lay on his bed in the dark, staring at the cracked ceiling.

And something in his chest began to burn.

At first, he thought it was panic.

Then it got worse.

A pulse throbbed beneath his ribs. Then another. Heat spread through his spine, into his throat, into his bones.

His body arched.

A sharp pop cracked inside his chest.

He screamed.

His bones shifted.

Not growing.

Reshaping.

His ribcage tightened. His spine bent. His hips twisted with a wrenching snap that stole his breath.

His skin rippled.

His hair spilled down his back, long and dark.

His throat constricted, reshaping the sound of him.

He tried to cry out, but what came out was higher. Thinner.

Wrong.

He slid off the bed, crawling toward the dresser.

The mirror waited.

A girl stared back.

Raven hair. Violet eyes. A face too soft to be his.

A face that was hers.

The scream tore out of her before she could stop it.

Footsteps thundered downstairs.

The door flew open.

“Larry, are you—”

Her mother froze.

“Where’s my son?”

The girl tried to speak.

“I’m right here.”

Her mother screamed.

And the girl ran.

also- I did not realize how many calatheas I had until now! I reverse- image searched these pics of my houseplants to figure out what they were called. It seems like they are notoriously disliked, and I’m not the good with plants, so I’m surprised I’ve kept them all kind of alive this long 😂 

1- Calathea picturata 'Argentea'- in bright, indirect light, watering when dry, about every 1.5-2 weeks 
2- in bright, indirect light, watering when dry, about every 1.5-2 weeks 
3- monstera deliciosa. in as bright of indirect light as possible. watering every 2 weeks usually. it’s recently started to produce 3 very small, non-fenestrated leaves. she seems very happy, but that is weird to me. looking to get a real moss pole for her and to add more perlite to the soil mix, but not sure if I should repot in winter. (also, i have 3 propagated monsteras that I got off of this plant. One is doing well, the other two are okay but not growing at all and looking just a little sad.) 
4- Calathea orbifolia. it has been unhappy for the whole 2 years i’ve had it but it just doesn’t die. 😂 it’s in moderate indirect light. i haven’t tried very hard with this guy. should i put it in my bathroom window where it’s humid? 
5- coffee plant. it was doing amazing, then i took a philodendron out of its pot and it got pretty upset. lookin a little crispy after that. i also have not tried very hard with this guy but he is pretty cool so i would like to learn how to take better care. 
6- Calathea concinna. i neglect this guy pretty hard and it likes it that way. The crispy leaves are some of the older ones.

I made it to the final round, they called my references, and then they finally told me a week before Christmas that they were going with a different candidate. (They said the hiring process was supposed to be concluded by Halloween.)

Let me be so clear, I'm broke and really needed that job. But I couldn't be happier they didn't hire me.

They initially said there were only two interview rounds. It was only after my second interview that they told me there was a third round they wanted the candidates to do. This would be an informal sit-down over coffee to see if I was a good culture fit. Since the position is remote, I was asked to drive to meet the only employee who works in the state. That person lives 2.5 hours away from me, so I took the offered option of meeting in the middle (1.5 hours of driving instead). I was told upfront and in writing that I would be reimbursed for the 180 miles I traveled roundtrip.

Cut to last week. They never sent instructions for reimbursement, so I emailed the person I've been talking to this whole process. They told me to take a screenshot of my trip and fill out a form, which they did not send. I flagged that they didn't send the form. I did not get a response.

I'm going to send another email this week, but fuck. I was not in a stable enough financial situation to drive that far for a 30-minute conversation. I've been through a lot of interviews and I've never had an extra round not disclosed before. And now I have to pull teeth to get the thing they told me in writing they would provide.

Let me start by saying this is not a normal ""will I be fine"" question. You can read my post history if you're curious but here is a brief recap:

I was a daily drinker of 1-2+ bottles of wine a day, one night I drank possibly between 3-4 bottles of wine and woke up in a completely abnormal state, potent brain fog and derealization, just completely out of it. Like sudden onset brain damage. Thought I would sleep it off but no luck, this state became my new normal and it scared me straight, I quit because of it.

For a few months I was in some kind of a messed up, anxious paralysis where life was hell and I spent every second regretting what I've done and how I'll never feel normal or clear again, worrying about dementia or schizophrenia, browsing reddit for reassurance.

At some point, life continued, I managed to start doing things again like gaming, exercising, working etc. Now 7 months later I'm in a much better place mentally. I escaped the paralysis, even if I still don't feel normal I've learned to live with my new condition (which I think might be a derealization disorder possibly coupled with some other type of brain malfunction) and I'm trying to be better every day. Especially with the new years I have a lot of resolutions to tackle (^; And I think getting a girlfren will also make me feel much better (ladies?) (22m btw)

Throughout this time I've stayed 100% sober, only ""drug"" I take is coffee. Despite numerous, NUMEROUS occasions to drink or party I have had zero desire to give in, mostly out of fear that my symptoms flare up or get worse. I have an occasional, DREADFUL anxiety attack that I am about to die or go psychotic, and I'm scared that drinking once will push me over that edge (but I'm sure that's just anxiety).

But now there is a VERY special occasion coming up. It is my BEST friend's wedding soon, and we will be having a bachelor's party. Throughout all the suffering, and vitriolic hate I've felt towards alcohol and myself, the pure disdain I developed for it, and the FEAR -- in the back of my head I always thought if there was ever one reason I'd even think of drinking again for an occasion, it would be with this guy. And now he's going to MARRY. I don't realistically see how I could attend the bachelor's and not drink, so I am mentally preparing myself for it. But I wanted to ask what do you think?

So just to be very clear:

- I'm NOT scared I make a fool of myself or do something I regret. I know many people's heads lose a screw when they're drunk, this has never been the case for me.

- I'm NOT scared drinking once will cause me to spiral back into alcoholism. My alcoholic arc is over. The damage was done, a mental scar has been made. I'm trying to build my life towards something meaningful now, and quite frankly I am way too scared of alcohol to be a casual drinker ever again.

- I AM scared that it might make my symptoms worse. The derealization, the anxiety, the Fog™. Like what if I drink and it gives me a panic attack? I'm just hoping for a feelgood night and celebration, and something as a social lubricant (I have had pretty bad social anxiety since high school). And this is how I think it would go, I think it will be fine, and it will only mainly suck if the days after I am stuck ruminating and overthinking on it.

Thanks in advance.

My job makes me deeply unhappy. I worked really hard to get here and was genuinely excited when I started. This is my first big corporate company and at the beginning, I did everything I could to prove myself. My performance was strong, managers were happy, and I honestly put in real effort.

But over time, all my motivation got crushed.

We’re constantly expected to do things that are clearly outside our job description. The workload is heavy, expectations keep expanding, and the way managers treat us is often openly disrespectful. They don’t even try to hide it. The company is already known for having a toxic culture (very low Glassdoor scores, especially around management)

Another thing that affects me a lot is the team environment. Almost all of my teammates are unhappy too, and we constantly talk about it among ourselves. That ongoing negativity definitely impacts me, but I don’t blame them, I’m the same way. The reason we vent to each other is because we don’t feel safe raising issues with HR or managers. Some people tried to do that earlier and later got fired for “other reasons”… which feels like a coincidence(!).

I’m earning £30k annually. They recently moved us to RTO 5 days a week. My first year is almost completed and everyone says there will be no salary increase. On top of that, they changed our job level (technically a “promotion”) but clearly told us not to expect any pay rise. Everyone I talk to says raises basically don’t exist here, and based on my last performance review, I believe it. I was given vague promises like “do this, improve that, and things will change.” I did all of it. Nothing changed.

At this point, I’m miserable. I dread going to work. The constant pressure and mobbing are exhausting. I can’t sleep properly due to stress, and when I get home, I often don’t even feel like eating.

So I’m genuinely asking:

* Is this actually unfair and unhealthy, and something I shouldn’t normalize?
* Am I being spoiled for feeling this way?
* I used to work in coffee shops when I was in uni, I was physically tired, but at least I was happy when I got home. Is this just “corporate life”?
* Should I endure this for a few years just to build my career?

Any perspective would really help. Thank you.",1,1768246422.0,careerguidance,2,0.99,False

Epic Pharma (dark blue round tablets) are so bad and primarily all that’s been available to me the last 2 years. I’ve shopped around pharmacies to ask who the pharma company is to avoid Epic, but I’m really tired of doing that every month and confusing my NP when I call to switch pharmacies yet again for the umpteenth time. 

I’m on 20mg er once daily and 10mg instant 2x a day of adderall. It’s already a kinda high dose and it’s not doing enough anymore. Some days I’m taking 30mg in the morning if it’s a busy day and it still feels like I didn’t take anything at all, even if I drink 2 cups of coffee on top of it. Am 31 and just finished grad school this past semester as a single parent while working for reference, I’m dx with severe combined type ADHD. 

This month my extended release pharma company is Lannett instead of actavis/teva, after being on back order all of November and December. My instants carried me thru the last 2 months (especially the end of the semester), but this month the instant provider is Glenmark and white round tablets. All I’ve felt this month so far is a dry mouth, and limited focus. At times I’ve felt manic with several people telling me my thoughts/texts/words I speak were going too fast, but the actual work I’m doing or productivity met is very little. I do have bipolar type 1 and take Abilify though, so I’m not actually manic- this is just a side effect of thjs combo of adderall specifically while it’s active in my system. 

I’m really sick of shopping around, I’m sick of my meds not working, I just want to function. When I had 5mg of actavis/teva instant release (small square round pills), it was fine. Even 10 mg when manufactured by actavis/teva. I’ve never had lannett or glenmark and don’t like them. Is this an issue with generic vyvanse too? My daughters concerta pharma company is actavis/teva which makes me lean towards asking my dr to switch me to that too just for believing in the quality of the generic meds from them. 

I met with my Dr earlier this month and she talked about having a med on the backburner in case I run into the back order issue again, like a small supply of Ritalin or concerta if needed. I’m also wondering how making the switch to vyvanse would do and if this is an issue with other ADHD stimulant meds besides adderall. Any and all advice/opinions/experience/commiseration welcome!!

1qb4jn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkArchive/comments/1qb4jn8/i_worked_a_decommissioned_fire_lookout_something/,I Worked a Decommissioned Fire Lookout. Something Used My Radio to Lure Me Outside.,"I wasn’t supposed to be staffing the lookout that week.

It was a favor. A gap in the schedule. A “can you just cover two nights until we get someone up there?” kind of thing.

I said yes because I’ve been saying yes to the park in some form for most of my adult life, and because the tower makes sense to me. The routine. The lists. The way your world shrinks down to weather, visibility, and a radio that either works or it doesn’t.

The lookout was technically “decommissioned,” which sounds dramatic until you realize it just means the budget moved on. The stairs were still solid, the catwalk still intact, the windows still swept clean enough to see smoke. The radio still had power if you fed the generator and kept the battery topped off.

It was the kind of place you could pretend was abandoned while still being maintained, because nobody wanted to be the person who admitted they’d let it rot.

I got up there around late afternoon with a pack, a thermos, and a clipboard. The sun was low enough that it turned the treetops copper. From the cab you could see the whole back side of the park: ridgelines folding into each other, cut by long shadows and a few pale scars where lightning fires had burned years ago.

The tower creaked in the wind the way all towers do. Not dangerous creaking. Just the sound of wood and metal remembering they’re tall.

Inside, everything smelled like dust, pine pitch, and old coffee.

There was a laminated sheet tacked by the radios with three bullet points in bold.

DO NOT REQUEST ASSISTANCE OVER UNMONITORED FREQUENCIES.

If you are lost, stay put. Use emergency phones or 911. If you hear a voice directing you off-trail, do not respond.

Somebody had underlined the last line twice, hard enough to emboss the plastic.

I remember smirking at it when I first saw it. Not because it was funny, but because it was such a weird thing to have to write down. It felt like superstition in a workplace that runs on checklists.

I did my first call-in with dispatch. Gave them my location, weather read, and the fact I had a clear view of the southern ridge. They logged it, told me to call again at 2100, and that was that.

The first few hours were quiet.

I made coffee on a little camp stove. I filled out a logbook nobody reads unless something goes wrong. I watched the light fade. The forest below turned into one solid dark mass with only the service road cutting a faint line through it.

The tower radio for the lookout was an old handheld unit plugged into a charging cradle by the window. Someone had wrapped the antenna base with a band of black electrical tape, and the casing had a crescent-shaped gouge on the bottom left corner, like it had been dropped on rock years ago and never repaired. The faceplate sticker was so sun-faded you could barely read it, but if you tilted it just right, you could make out the handwritten block letters: LOOKOUT 3.

Around 2030, the radio squelched and popped in a way that made my shoulders lift automatically. You don’t ignore that sound, not out there.

“Lookout Three, dispatch,” came the voice. “You copy?”

I pressed the transmit. “Copy. Go ahead.”

There was a pause, then dispatch again. “We got some weird traffic earlier. Not on our main. Just letting you know in case you hear it.”

I glanced at the laminated sheet by the radio.

“Define weird,” I said.

Dispatch sounded tired. Same operator I’d talked to a hundred times, the kind who can sound calm even when there’s a crash on the highway and someone’s screaming in the background.

“Unmonitored channel. Someone calling for ranger assistance. Using the word ‘lookout.’”

My stomach tightened a little. “Someone knows there’s a tower up here.”

“Yeah,” dispatch said. “Probably kids. Or someone with an old radio. You’re not to answer anything that isn’t us. If you hear it, log it. That’s all.”

I looked at the underlined line on the laminated sheet and felt my earlier smirk dry up.

“Copy,” I said. “I won’t engage.”

I meant it.

At 2100, I called dispatch with my update. Wind had picked up. Temperature dropping. Visibility still good.

“Copy,” dispatch said. “If you hear anything unusual, do not respond. Do not leave the tower. Rangers are already stretched thin.”

“Copy,” I repeated.

I remember looking at the stairs after that. The trapdoor that led down. The way the tower’s shadow cut across the catwalk in the moonlight. I remember thinking, for no logical reason, that it would be easy to step out and go down and check the perimeter, just to prove to myself nothing was out there.

I didn’t do it.

I locked the trapdoor like I always do in old structures, because it keeps the wind from rattling it. I set my flashlight beside the logbook. I sat in the chair by the window and listened to the tower creak.

At 2217, the radio squelched again, but this time it wasn’t dispatch.

Not a call sign. Not a proper prefix.

Just a soft click, then a voice, thin through static.

“Ranger…?”

I froze with my coffee halfway to my mouth.

I didn’t touch the transmit button.

The voice came again, a little clearer. “Ranger, I need help.”

It sounded like a man trying to keep panic down. Breathing too fast. Words clipped. The kind of voice you hear right before people do something stupid.

I stared at the radio like it was going to bite me.

The laminated sheet was right there in my peripheral vision. The underlined warning felt like it was aimed directly at me.

Do not respond.

I sat still.

The voice on the unmonitored channel tried again. “I’m on Trail Six, I think. I’m lost. I can’t find the pull-off. Ranger station, do you copy?”

Trail Six was on the back side. It wasn’t the busiest trail, but it wasn’t obscure. People wandered on it all the time thinking it was “easy.”

My thumb hovered over transmit, then stopped.

I told myself I could call dispatch. That’s the right move. Log it. Let someone with authority decide if it’s real.

I picked up the handset for the main dispatch channel.

Before I could key it, the unmonitored channel voice came again, lower now.

“I can hear you up there,” it said. “Please.”

My throat went dry.

You could hear the tower. The generator hum. The wind.

But “hear you up there” made it feel like there was a line between us that wasn’t radio at all.

I keyed dispatch.

“Dispatch, Lookout Three.”

“Go ahead,” dispatch said immediately, alert now.

“I’m receiving traffic on an unmonitored frequency. Caller claims lost on Trail Six. Says he can hear me up here.”

There was a pause, then dispatch again, quieter. “Do not engage. We’ll send a unit to check Trail Six access points. Stay in the tower. Confirm you’re secure.”

“I’m secure,” I said. “Trapdoor locked.”

“Copy,” dispatch said. “Do not leave. Do not respond.”

I set the handset down.

On the unmonitored channel, the man’s voice changed.

It went flat for a second, like the emotion dropped out.

Then it said, in my own voice, “Lookout Three, dispatch.”

I felt my stomach drop in a way I haven’t felt since I was a kid and a car spun out on ice right in front of me.

It wasn’t a perfect recording quality. It was radio-thin. But it was my cadence. My breath. The tiny throat-clear I do without thinking before I speak.

The radio clicked again, and my own voice repeated, “Go ahead.”

I didn’t move.

I didn’t even breathe right.

The unmonitored channel kept going like it was practicing.

“My location, weather read…”

It was pulling phrases out of context, stitching them together like a puppet.

I grabbed the lookout radio and turned the volume down until the speaker was barely audible. Not off. I couldn’t bring myself to turn it off. Off felt like it would be worse, like closing your eyes when you’re sure something is still there.

I wrote in the logbook with a shaking hand.

2217: Unmonitored traffic. Male voice. Trail Six. Mimicked my call sign and dispatch phrasing.

I underlined mimicked twice, hard enough the pen tore the paper.

The tower creaked.

Outside, the wind rose and fell.

Then I heard something that wasn’t radio at all.

A knock.

Not on the trapdoor.

On the base of the tower, far below.

One heavy knock, metal on wood.

I stood so fast the chair scraped.

I leaned toward the floor hatch, listening.

Another knock.

Then, faintly, a voice from below, carried up through the stairwell like someone standing at the bottom and shouting carefully.

“Ranger!”

My skin tightened.

No one should have been down there. The access road is gated at night. There are signs. There are cameras, even if they’re old.

I moved to the window and looked down.

The base of the tower was a black shape among darker trees. The moonlight didn’t reach the ground well.

I saw nothing.

Then the voice came again, from directly below the tower, and it sounded like dispatch.

“Lookout Three, come down. We need you.”

My mouth went numb.

Dispatch would never tell me to leave the tower at night for a lost camper without sending a unit. Dispatch would never use that tone, like it was urgent and casual at the same time.

I reached for the main dispatch handset.

“Dispatch, Lookout Three,” I said, forcing my voice steady. “Confirm you did not send anyone to tower base.”

Dispatch answered instantly, and there was something in the operator’s voice I hadn’t heard before.

A tightness.

“Negative,” dispatch said. “No units at your location. Stay in the tower. Do not open the hatch.”

As she spoke, the voice from below overlapped her.

“Open the hatch.”

Same words. Same rhythm.

Not through the radio speaker.

Through the stairs.

It was like the tower itself was relaying it.

I backed away from the trapdoor until my shoulders hit the opposite wall.

Dispatch kept talking, faster now. “Listen to me. Do not respond to any voice that is not on this channel. Do not open the tower. Units are en route to the access road. Do you understand?”

“I understand,” I said, but my voice came out thin.

Below, the knocking started again. Slow. Patient.

Knock.

Pause.

Knock.

Like it knew I was counting.

The unmonitored radio channel hissed in the background, even with the volume low, and through it I heard my own voice whispering, “Please.”

I don’t know what did it.

I’ve replayed the next part a hundred times and I still can’t point to a single moment where my brain broke. It wasn’t a sudden decision. It was like a series of tiny rationalizations stacking up until I couldn’t see the drop-off anymore.

Maybe someone really was down there. Maybe a hiker found the tower and was terrified. Maybe dispatch was wrong and a unit had already made it to the base. Maybe, if I just cracked the hatch and called down, I could clear it up.

Maybe the laminated sheet was for something else.

Maybe I was being dramatic.

I hate myself for the thought even now, but there was another thing too.

The voice from below sounded like my brother.

My younger brother has been dead for three years. Car accident. Wrong place, wrong time, drunk driver.

I hadn’t heard his voice in a long time, not cleanly, not without memory blurring it.

From below the tower, through the stairwell, came his voice, small like he was trying not to scare me.

“Hey,” it said. “It’s cold.”

I felt my eyes sting.

I stepped toward the hatch like a sleepwalker.

Dispatch was still in my ear, but it sounded far away now, like a TV in another room.

I unlocked the trapdoor.

The second the lock turned, the knocking stopped.

The silence that followed wasn’t dramatic. It was just empty.

I pulled the hatch up an inch and peered down into the stairwell.

Blackness. A faint smell of damp wood and old rust.

I didn’t see anyone.

I didn’t hear breathing.

Then, from halfway down the stairs, the radio crackle sound happened again, but it wasn’t coming from the lookout radio.

It was coming from the stairwell itself, like static in the air.

And my brother’s voice said softly, “Come on.”

I opened the hatch fully.

The cold air that came up was wrong. It wasn’t just night air. It smelled sour, like wet fur and something metallic.

I backed up, hand on my flashlight.

Dispatch’s voice sharpened. “Lookout Three, what are you doing? Confirm you are in the tower and the hatch is secured.”

I lied.

“In the tower,” I said. “Hatch secured.”

The words tasted like pennies.

I don’t know why I lied. Maybe because part of me already knew I was about to do something I couldn’t explain.

I grabbed my flashlight and stepped down into the stairwell.

The tower groaned as my weight shifted onto the stairs.

Each step down felt like stepping into thicker air. The darkness pressed in tight around the flashlight beam, making it feel small and weak. The metal railing was cold under my hand.

Halfway down, the beam caught something on a step.

A strip of reflective tape.

Park trail marker tape.

It was stuck to the metal like someone had pressed it there.

I stopped. My heart hammered.

That tape shouldn’t have been inside the tower. Nobody comes up here and starts peeling markers off trees to decorate.

The voice from below didn’t rush me.

It just said, patient, “Almost there.”

I kept going.

At the bottom, the tower’s base platform was open to the air. From there you step onto the ground, onto packed dirt and needles. The flashlight beam swept across the base supports, the old maintenance box, the little post where the fire extinguisher used to hang.

No person.

No ranger truck.

No fresh footprints.

I stood at the base of the tower and felt the night press in from all sides.

“Ranger?” I called, and my voice sounded too loud.

Nothing answered.

Then the lookout radio, still up in the cab, crackled faintly through the structure.

And in my own voice, it said, “Here.”

The word came from the trees to my left too, at the exact same time.

“Here.”

Like two speakers playing the same track.

My stomach dropped hard enough I almost gagged.

I backed toward the tower stairs.

The flashlight beam caught movement between two trunks.

Not a full shape. Just a shift. Something tall adjusting its weight.

I swung the light fully and saw it.

It was upright, but it wasn’t standing like a man. It looked assembled wrong. Too thin. Too long. Arms hanging low with too many joints.

The head was not antlers, not a clean skull like you see in cheap horror. It was like skin pulled tight over something sharp. Ridges under the surface. A mouth that didn’t sit right on the face, stretched farther than it should be.

The worst part was the eyes.

Not glowing. Not bright.

Dull, wet reflections in the flashlight beam, like stones at the bottom of a creek.

It didn’t charge.

It stepped forward once, quiet and confident, closing distance in a way my brain couldn’t map properly.

I turned and ran.

I hit the stairs and took them two at a time, boots clanging on metal. My hands shook so hard I nearly missed the railing.

Behind me, something moved through brush without crashing. It sounded like it knew exactly where to place its weight.

I got five steps up before a sound like a dry throat clicking came from right below the tower, closer than it should have been.

I looked down without meaning to.

It was on the first landing already, climbing without haste, long limbs folding wrong.

My flashlight beam caught its hands on the rail.

Hands like bundled sticks. Fingers too long, too many joints, gripping like clamps.

I bolted up again, lungs burning.

The tower creaked in protest, like it hated being part of this.

I hit the trapdoor platform and shoved the hatch up, scrambling through. My shoulder slammed the frame. Pain shot down my arm, but I didn’t care.

I got one knee into the cab and reached back to slam the hatch—

—and something caught me.

Not a grip. A swipe.

A fast, cold rake across my back through my shirt, like dragging a handful of bent nails from shoulder blade to ribs.

The pain didn’t even register right away. It was heat and shock and a breath that turned into a noise I didn’t recognize as mine.

I fell forward into the cab, slammed my palms on the floor, and kicked back hard. The hatch dropped. Wood thudded into place.

Then the burning hit full force.

I scrambled upright and fumbled for the lock. It didn’t align. My hands were shaking too much.

Below me, the hatch bumped once, gently, as if something had tested it.

Then again.

I shoved my weight onto it and finally got the lock to catch with a metallic click.

I pressed my back against the far wall of the cab and felt wetness spreading under my shirt. The scratches stung with every breath, each inhale pulling at torn fabric and skin like the injury wanted to remind me it was there.

Dispatch was still on my actual channel, voice edged with panic now.

“Lookout Three, respond. Respond now.”

Under my feet, another voice repeated her exact words a half-second later, using her tone so well it made my teeth ache.

I forced myself to key dispatch.

“It’s at the tower,” I said, words coming out in ragged pieces. “It mimics. It got into the stairwell. It—”

My voice hitched when my back spasmed.

Dispatch didn’t waste time asking what it was. “Stay away from the hatch. Barricade if you can. Units are two minutes out.”

The hatch bumped again, harder.

A sound like claws, or nails, dragging along the wood.

My stomach rolled. My back was on fire. I could taste copper at the back of my throat from biting down too hard.

I grabbed the heavy chair and shoved it over the hatch.

Then I grabbed the small table and jammed it against the chair.

The tower shook slightly, and for the first time I realized the thing wasn’t just testing the hatch.

It was putting weight on the tower.

Like it was climbing the supports.

The windows rattled.

The catwalk outside the cab gave a soft metallic ping as something stepped onto it.

The flashlight beam caught a shadow pass over the window.

Tall.

Too thin.

I backed away until I hit the far wall of the cab, my back screaming, and I nearly blacked out from the sudden flare of pain.

The radio shrieked with static. Not dispatch. The other channel.

And then, in my own voice, right in the speaker by my ear, it said softly, “Come down.”

The window behind me thudded once, like something tapped it with a knuckle.

Then again, harder.

I saw the outline press against the glass for a split second. Not a face, not clear, just a suggestion of that stretched mouth and ridged head.

The glass bowed.

It didn’t break, but it flexed enough to make me realize how old it was. How many winters it had seen. How many times it had been heated and cooled and stressed.

The thing outside didn’t rush. It didn’t slam wildly.

It tapped. Then waited. Then tapped again.

Like it knew time was on its side.

Dispatch was still talking, telling me to hold, to stay put, that headlights were on the access road, that they were almost there.

I believed her.

And then the voice on the other side of the glass said, in my brother’s voice again, small and cold, “I’m scared.”

That almost got me.

I won’t lie.

My hand moved toward the hatch without permission. A reflex built from a lifetime of responding to voices asking for help.

I stopped myself by biting down on the inside of my cheek until I tasted blood.

The tapping on the window stopped.

For a few seconds, the tower was still except for my breathing and the faint crackle of radios and the slow drip of something warm down my side under my shirt.

Then something scraped across the roof.

Slow.

Like fingernails being dragged along metal.

The sound traveled from one end of the roof to the other, then stopped above my head.

I looked up without meaning to.

The ceiling was thin paneling. If something heavy sat on it, the whole cab would feel it.

The tower creaked, a deep groan, like it was taking a breath.

And then the hatch behind my barricade bumped from below again.

Two directions.

It was on the roof and under the floor.

Or it wanted me to think it was.

Then headlights washed the trees below in white beams, sweeping back and forth.

A ranger truck.

Another.

Radios on the dispatch channel erupted with voices. Call signs. Orders. Real human urgency.

The scraping on the roof stopped immediately.

The tapping stopped.

The pressure under the hatch eased.

For one shaky breath, I thought it was over. That it would retreat when there were more people.

Then, over the unmonitored channel, in dispatch’s exact voice, came a calm instruction.

“Units, proceed off-road. Follow the voice.”

I heard a ranger on the main channel hesitate. “Dispatch, confirm.”

Dispatch snapped, real and sharp. “Negative. Stay on the road. Do not go off-road. Do not follow any voice.”

And then, like it was enjoying itself, the unmonitored channel repeated her denial in her voice but with a tiny twist, like a smile hidden in it.

“Proceed.”

Below, one of the trucks turned its lights toward the tree line, and for a brief second I saw the shape at the edge of the beams.

Tall.

Too thin.

Half-hidden like it didn’t want to be fully seen.

Then it stepped back into the woods and the darkness swallowed it.

The rangers stayed on the road. They didn’t chase. They didn’t play hero. They swept the area, found nothing, and told me to stay in the cab until morning.

When daylight came, they walked me down the tower with two people on either side like I was the fragile one.

Halfway down, my shirt had dried stiff against my back. Every step made the scratches flare again, like the air itself was cutting me.

At the base, one of the rangers asked, “You hit something?”

I shook my head once, because I didn’t know how to answer without sounding like a lunatic.

At the park office later, I tried to explain what happened in a way that didn’t make me sound like I’d lost my mind in the dark. I talked about radio interference. About prank calls. About an animal under the tower.

The older clerk behind the counter didn’t laugh.

She slid a binder toward me, opened to a page that looked like it had been read too many times.

Incident reports. Dates. Channels. Notes about mimicry and unmonitored frequencies.

At the bottom of the page was a line underlined twice.

If it uses your voice, it already has you.

They sent me to urgent care in town anyway, the way they do when paperwork starts to smell like liability. The nurse didn’t ask many questions. She just had me turn around, lifted my shirt carefully, and went quiet for a second.

“You got lucky,” she said.

They cleaned the scratches, bandaged them in long strips, and told me to watch for infection. The back of my shirt went into a plastic bag like evidence. I drove home with my shoulders tight, trying not to move too much because every shift tugged at the raw lines under the gauze.

I quit volunteering the next week.

Not out of fear of the woods in general. I can walk a trail in daylight and enjoy it like anyone.

I quit because I learned something I can’t unlearn.

There are rules out there that aren’t about bears or weather or dehydration. There are rules about what happens when you ask for help the wrong way, on the wrong channel, in the wrong place.

And there’s one more detail I haven’t told anyone in the park system because I don’t want to see the look on their faces.

Sometime after midnight, a couple nights later, I finally fell asleep in my own bed.

I woke up at 2:17 a.m. exactly.

Not the slow drift up from a dream. The kind where your eyes open and your body is already tight, like it heard something before your brain caught up.

My back ached under the bandages. I could feel the scabbed lines pulling every time I breathed too deep.

The apartment was quiet. No cars. No neighbors. The heater clicked once and stopped.

Then I heard it.

Not from outside.

From inside the room.

A soft burst of static, like a speaker waking up.

A click.

My throat closed. I sat up so fast the sheet tangled around my legs.

The sound came again, clearer now. Static, then a tiny, controlled squelch, like someone had keyed a mic and let go.

It wasn’t my phone. My phone was on the dresser, dark and charging.

I swung my bedside lamp on.

The light filled the room, bright and normal, and for half a second my brain tried to calm down. Tried to tell me it was nothing.

Then I saw the green glow.

A faint, sick little rectangle of light coming from the crack under my bedroom door.

My heart started banging hard enough to make my vision pulse.

I got out of bed and limped to the door, barefoot, quiet, holding my breath like it mattered.

I opened it.

The hallway was lit only by the kitchen nightlight. The glow on the floor wasn’t from that.

It was coming from my living room.

I stepped out and followed it, slow, like approaching a trap you can already see.

On my coffee table—centered like someone had placed it carefully—was the tower radio from the lookout.

I knew it instantly.

Not because of the model.

Because I could see the black electrical tape wrapped around the antenna base, and that crescent-shaped gouge on the bottom left corner of the casing—the one I’d noticed because it made the radio sit crooked in its cradle up in the cab. The faceplate sticker was still sun-faded, but in the lamplight I could make out the handwritten block letters if I leaned close enough.

LOOKOUT 3.

And taped to the side of it—pressed flat, neat as a label—was a strip of reflective trail marker tape.

I didn’t touch it.

I just stood there, staring at the radio like it was a live animal.

The speaker crackled again.

Click.

Then my own voice came out of it, patient and calm, the way I sound when I’m trying to keep somebody else from panicking.

“Lookout Three… do you copy?”

I backed up until my shoulders hit the wall, and the movement tugged at my bandages hard enough to make me hiss.

The radio clicked again, and this time it didn’t use my voice.

It used dispatch.

Sharp. Official. Convincing.

“Confirm you are secure.”

I stood there in my hallway, barefoot, shaking, staring at a radio that didn’t belong in my apartment, and I realized something that made my stomach turn cold.

It wasn’t just copying voices.

It wasn’t just playing with a frequency.

It knew where the tower was.

It knew where I lived.

And it knew exactly what words would make me answer.

I didn’t answer.

I didn’t even breathe right.

I walked backward into my bedroom and shut the door and locked it like that meant anything.

The radio kept talking out in my living room, voice changing every few seconds—mine, dispatch, my brother—cycling through the ones that worked best.

I stayed in my room until sunrise, listening to it through the wall like you listen to an intruder moving around your house.

At 6:41 a.m., it went quiet.

No static. No click.

Just silence.

When I finally opened my door, the radio was gone.

There was no mark on the table. No tape. No dust disturbed. No sign it had ever been there.

Except for one thing.

On the hardwood in front of my coffee table, right where the green glow had pooled, was a single strip of reflective tape pressed flat to the floor like a breadcrumb.

He walks into the attached cafe. I walk into the cafe. We both are waiting for our coffees and smile at each other. He introduces himself. I ask if he just moved here and he says Today.

I tell him I thought he might be my godson as I dissolved my friendship with my godson's mother years ago. We laugh. (And yes...I understand how weird that is) We end up talking. I offer to take his resume and number and tell him I will connect him to a few friends in publishing. He asks me if I write and I tell him I write about age gap relationships. Specifically older women and younger men. He says he would love to read it sometime.

I go back to work and Google his name and the famous writer that he worked for in London and up pops his info. And he is gay. Or at least I think he is.

No roommates, no hand-me-down furniture, just my own place that I actually get to set up how I want.

Now I’m deep in the decorating rabbit hole, especially the living room. I don’t want a bunch of temporary stuff, and I’m at a point where I’d rather buy fewer things, but buy them right and keep them for a long time.

1qb4gla,https://i.redd.it/86qmybyfyycg1.png,My first (borrowed) Pebble,"I’ve had all types of watches, but I’ve felt that they are either too little or too much. Pebble seems to find the sweet spot between a Casio and a smartwatch, giving me the option of having more than one timer, without having to walk around with a lightbulb on my wrist.

I’ve pre-ordered the Round 2, and I’ve gotten very excited about Pebble in general. My problem is that I haven’t got a Pebble to use in the meantime, and they’re not exactly easy to get hold of. I was lucky that my brother had a couple lying around that he hasn’t used for a decade. One of them, a Pebble Steel, showed the logo when charging but didn‘t boot. He did, however, have a Pebble Time with a working battery. It had a way too heavy steel band, but I was able to replace it with a 22mm universal silicone one. I got the stuck quick-release spring bar moving with some help from isopropanol and by pressing with the butt end of a plastic flosser.

I’ve used the Pebble for a bit more than a day now, and I’ve figured out how I want to use it. Besides checking the time, I mainly need timers and alarms. The only app I have installed is the official timer app. I have one predefined timer for brewing coffee, and one for taking a nap. Because the Pebble has buttons, I can rely on muscle memory when starting them. I have experimented with weather apps, but I honestly find it more useful to check the weather in detail on my phone or laptop.

I quickly discovered the watch faces by TTMM, which I found both good-looking and easy to read. TIC-WATCHTTMM and TIC-TTMMBRN are my favorites, so I bought a bundle. I hope he has something optimized for the Round 2 once that is out. I also look forward to the optical bonding and display improvements in the new model, as the contrast on this old unit can sometimes be a bit hard to read. For that reason, I have changed the backlight duration from 3 to 5 seconds.

Not only do I find the Pebble useful, but it’s also incredibly fun to use. I love that the OS is written in a low-level language like C. I’m counting down each day until May, and I consider myself lucky to have an old working Pebble until then.",5,1768245861.0,pebble,1,0.86,False

If we weren’t leaving the area, we’d stay in a heartbeat—and honestly hope we can move back here when we are back next year.

✨ **The Apartment**

* Spacious **2-bedroom, 1-bath**
* Flexible layout: we currently use the **largest room as a living room**, but it easily converts back into a bedroom
* We’ve comfortably had **two separate home offices** (great for WFH) separate from the living room and bedroom
* Laundry in the basement
* **$2,780/month**
* **Feb 1 availability**
* Responsive, kind landlord
* Lovely backyard and front porch, both great for hanging out

📍 **The location (our favorite part)**

* \~15-minute walk to **Davis Square**
* \~5-minute walk to **Magoun Square T stop**
* Surrounded by incredible coffee spots: **3 Little Figs, New Leaf Espresso, Hearth & Hug** (seriously spoiled us)
* Friendly neighbors

This place has been cozy and the neighborhood is one of those rare spots that just *feels right*. We’re hoping the next tenants love it as much as we have.

In my teens i desperately wanted to experience a relationship as everybody does in that age.

Unfortunately, I was a bit slow in overall IQ in comparisons to my peers and friends in school.

I'm 21 years old now, and getting relationship proposals now, right after when I gave up the idea of getting in a relationship.

I'm left feeling angry, disappointed and resentful towards relationships now.

Why. Because it took my 6 years to get a coffee date right when I gave up on the idea.

How do you feel, do you have similar experience ?

TL;DR: wanted a relationship, but wasn't lucky. After 6 years I'm suddenly bombarded with relationship proposals. Feelings like anger, frustration surfacing because a) time wasted on fantasizing about relationships(6 years), b) finally getting relationship proposals right when I don't want it anymore.

1qb4ai9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IrvineFurnitureGems/comments/1qb4ai9/glam_deal_safavieh_gold_glass_coffee_table_99/,[Glam Deal] Safavieh Gold & Glass Coffee Table - $99 (Retail ~$250),"📍 Location: Corona (Short drive north on the 261/15)

💰 Price: $99 (Safavieh tables usually retail $200+)

🏷️ Tag: 🟢 Selling



💎 The Aesthetic:

Gold Finish: The frame is crafted of iron with a gold/brass finish. Perfect for adding a ""pop of luxury"" to a neutral room.

Glass Top: Glass tables are amazing for apartments because they don't block visuals—they make the room feel bigger and airier.

Curved Base: Has a nice geometric/curved design that looks more expensive than a standard square table.



🧐 Gary's Note:

""The seller buried the lead here.

Deep in the description text, it mentions 'Safavieh'.

That is a legit furniture brand, not generic Amazon stuff.

If you are going for that 'Z Gallerie' or 'West Elm Glam' look, this fits perfectly for under $100.

Condition: Listed as 'Like New'.

Corona is not too far (probably 20 mins from North Irvine). Definitely worth it if you want to add some shine to your living room.""



⚠️ Glass Alert: Bring blankets to wrap the glass top for the drive home!

1qb49ic,https://i.redd.it/ekyn7kfhxycg1.jpeg,Glazed Air Fryer Donuts for a Delicious Easy Recipe,"There’s just something about donuts, right? Comfort food at its finest, but I don’t always feel like deep frying or buying a dozen that I definitely don’t need to eat all at once. That’s where these glazed air fryer donuts come in – an easy way to cure a donut craving without the mess of frying or the guilt of overindulging. They’re quick, ridiculously soft, and you likely have most of the ingredients at home already. I wrote down the full steps here: [https://www.amgroyal.com/glazed-air-fryer-donuts](https://www.amgroyal.com/glazed-air-fryer-donuts)  
  
For the donuts:  
  
\- 2 cups all-purpose flour  
\- 2 tsp baking powder  
\- 1/4 tsp baking soda  
\- 1/4 tsp salt  
\- 1/2 cup granulated sugar  
\- 2 tbsp melted butter  
\- 1/2 cup milk (any milk works)  
\- 1 tsp vanilla extract  
  
For the glaze:  
  
\- 1 cup powdered sugar  
\- 2–3 tbsp milk  
\- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract  
  
1. Start by mixing the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar) in a large bowl.  
2. In a separate bowl, combine the wet ingredients – melted butter, milk, and vanilla extract. Slowly pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until a dough forms.  
3. Roll the dough out on a floured surface to about ½ inch thick, then use a donut cutter or two round cutters to punch out the donuts (and don’t forget the donut holes!).  
4. Preheat your air fryer to 350°F (or 175°C). Lightly grease the basket and place the donuts in a single layer, leaving space between them. Cook for 5–6 minutes, flipping halfway.  
5. While the donuts cool slightly, make the glaze by whisking together powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Adjust the milk to get your desired consistency (runny but not watery).  
6. Dip each donut into the glaze while they’re still warm, letting any excess drip off for that perfect shiny finish. Let them set on a wire rack for a couple of minutes before diving in!  
  
Notes:  
\- If you don’t have a donut cutter, no worries. Just use a regular glass for the outer shape and something smaller (like a bottle cap) for the center hole.  
\- They’re best enjoyed the same day, but if you want to save some, store them in an airtight container to keep them soft.  
\- Want a flavor twist? Add a sprinkle of cinnamon into the donut batter or swap the vanilla extract in the glaze for almond or maple extract.  
\- These are soooo good with coffee. Just saying.

Safe to say, I spent so much time building that account. That Google account has been with me since elementary school and now I’m on my freshman year of college.

Today was the first day of my second college semester, I pulled an all nighter, getting my huge bag unpacked, and supplemented the sleep for hundreds of mgs of caffeine, two coffees, and one red bull to be exact, safe to say, I feel like a jitter machine right now. I often receive business emails, offering collaboration, I’m at the point where there are a lot of scammers contact me which until now I’ve dodged, but also I legit been sent products for free and done affiliate marketing. I had two companies I was in the process of making content for today, had the videos filmed and was about to go into editing so that I could send it off.

I had received an email from a brand called Collabstr, I had heard people legit talking about it, as I always research stuff so I thought it was a legit site. Went onto it, my phone isn’t blocking it or saying that it looks suspicious, which it usually does for these scam websites. I’m directed to log in, which I’ve done on many sites before no problem and it looks like a normal google verification. It says that someone is trying to log in from my city but in a different state. My dumb sleep deprived brain though that it was a vpn or something changing the state. No, it was a scammer.

They done took my shit, changed the password, removed my passkey, and changed my recovery email. I’ve had that account since I was 9 years old man, so many photos, my bank accounts were connected to it, my school account, my channel that I put so much time into. All gone. I feel so gullible and stupid, I should’ve slept last night. I would’ve never done this properly rested.

What can I do about this? I’m freaking out. Who should I contact?

Either way, if you’re reading this be careful, stay vigilant, get enough sleep, Don’t be a stupid gullible kid like me. I done fucked myself over, I pray to God that they don’t do some illegal shit with my account.

Account recovery isn’t possible because they changed all the 2 step verification details of my account I can’t dm team youtube but I’ve tagged them, Idk what else I can try.

But I really am struggling to get over a few weeks ago when he got angry after his therapy appointment. (It's not couples counseling, its individual therapy that he appears to be trying to use as relationship and work counseling.)

I am still shocked that he tried a thing suggested in therapy where he sat down and asked me my feelings. Then started picking apart my feelings and perspective and started telling me how he felt. 

Then when I interrupted him and told him I literally did not want to sit there and listen to him monologue about his defensiveness and that I just wanted comfort, he blew up and said that I asked him if he had anything to say but I was dismissing his feelings and just wanted comfort.

I literally never asked him to ignore everything I said and just start talking about his stupid 'defensive' mode. I literally don't care about it anymore. Maybe he sensed that? Because maybe he's right. Maybe I don't care about his feelings anymore. Or maybe I just have swallowed down so much that I can't fit anymore hurt feelings inside of me. There's no room.

'You ask me if I have anything to say, then say you just want comfort?!' 

He was so angry. Angry that I wanted the man who used to call me his wife (we aren't married, he started calling me that first) to give me comfort.

1qb447r,https://smokymountainnews.com/news/item/40721-2025-a-look-back-nothingburger-award,2025 A Look Back: Nothingburger award,"Western North Carolina pulled into the congressional drive-thru after Hurricane Helene, placed a large order and waited. And waited. And waited.

What Rep. Chuck Edwards finally handed his constituents was an empty paper bag containing a rather large nothingburger — heavy on branding, light on substance and nowhere near the $60 billion recovery order his storm-famished district actually placed. 

Sure, Congress served up a whopping $100 billion continuing resolution/disaster relief bill in December 2024 — Edwards claimed authorship — but for some damn reason, the meat of it wasn’t designated for Edwards’ constituents. Estimates put North Carolina’s piece of the pie at between $9 billion and $15 billion. In fast food terms, that’s like asking for a 10-piece McNuggets but only getting one.

Days ago on social media, Edwards claimed he was “fighting for Western North Carolina” and bragged about the $6.5 billion he says he’s dished out; not exactly a supersized Big Mac meal with large fry — more like a few stray ketchup packets, leaving people who’ve lost their livelihoods and homes asking, “Where’s the beef?”

In Swannanoa and within sight of some of those damaged homes, Edwards famously gave Trump a McDonald’s fry cook pin — a fitting gesture from a congressman who owns multiple franchises and seems more comfortable serving up symbolism than substance.

In the end, Edwards has delivered a master class in empty calories. Big branding. Greasy fealty. Zero nutrition. Western North Carolina ordered disaster relief and got a Happy Meal toy and a few napkins instead.

While somebody should congratulate Edwards on his award by offering him a steaming hot beverage from the McCafe menu, technically, no one can — because coffee is for closers.",22,1768245121.0,asheville,4,0.97,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some real talk about parking for the east side dance company show on 01/15. the town hall is right in the middle of the theater district on a thursday night, which honestly means traffic is going to be straight up gridlock starting around 5:30 pm. don't even try to roll up five minutes before 7:00 pm.  
  
if you want to completely skip the garage lines and the crazy traffic around 42nd and 6th ave, check out \*\*prked\*\*. it's an app where you can rent driveways or private garage spots from people right next to the venue. it’s way cheaper than most commercial garages and you can usually find something just a one or two block short walk away. it's the insider move to avoid the madness.  
  
for the traditional routes, your official best bet is the \*\*myers parking garage\*\* at 141 w. 43rd st. they offer a sweet discount if you stop by the town hall box office first with your same-day ticket stub to grab a coupon. this is what the venue recommends, so they know it’s reliable.  
  
but that’s not your only option. the whole area is packed with garages, so if myers is full or too pricey, you can shop around a few blocks north or south. for example, the \*\*120 w 45th st garage\*\* is usually a bit cheaper, starting around the low twenty dollar range for a few hours, about a four-minute walk away. there's also the \*\*217 w 44th st garage\*\* which comes up as one of the cheapest to pre-book, around twenty-five bucks for a short-term spot. others super close include the valet spot at \*\*113 w 43rd st\*\* or the one at \*\*143 w 40th st\*\*.  
  
the best strategy is to download a parking app like spothero or parkwhiz and pre-book your spot near w 40th, w 45th, or w 46th streets to lock in a price and guarantee a space. it is midtown on a thursday so reserving is smart.  
  
as for street parking, forget it. it's new york, and the theater district is a tow-away zone nightmare. while you might spot a metered space five blocks away, it’s not worth the stress or the risk of a ticket or god forbid, the tow truck.  
  
seriously, budget at least an extra 30 minutes just for traffic and finding a spot if you’re driving in. the nyc evening rush hour combined with broadway crowds is brutal. arrive early, park immediately, and grab a coffee before the show.  
  
hope this helps and enjoy the show!",1,1768245037.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

As commenter advised in my [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pylbvc/next_level_up_after_delonghi_dedica_bottomless/) to help choose new coffee machine, I am going first have better grinder. Currently I have Delonghi Dedica EC685 with bottomless setup and noname manual grinder a-la comandante, which works quite well.

So I am considering between this options in EU:

**DF54 V3** \[€250-€280\] - worrying about weak motor and clogging, but I am using medium roast beans, and some hand cleaning so should be fine. Also no restriction about time of grinding for me.

**Eureka Mignon Zero 55s** \- nice price 250€ in coffeefriend. Solid reliable Italian model, even made in Chinese factory.

**DF64 Gen 2.5** \- \[380€-400€\] bigger burs and stronger motor, than DF54. But significantly higher price, is that reasonable to pay almost 70% more to get this df64 or DF54 is enough? I do not plan to replace or update burrs in some closest future. Is taste of espresso will be much better with DF64 than DF54?    Here exist also some alternatives, for example AVX NB64V\[355€\] with variable motor speed, but not sure about plasma ionization there.

**DC63** \- \[370€\] similar as DF64 but with conical burrs. This time I would like to try flat burrs, as I have my manual grinder with conical burrs.

1qb3tz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1qb3tz4/aita_for_refusing_alimony_to_my_husband_after_he/,"AITA for refusing alimony to my husband after he spent $27K of my inheritance on his ex's OnlyFans, then claimed it was 'depression treatment'?","I just watched my husband's lawyer argue that spending $27,000 of our joint savings on OnlyFans subscriptions to his ex-girlfriend counts as ""emotional support during a difficult time"" and that I should pay HIM alimony.

The bank statements are spread across the kitchen table right now. Six months of charges. $150 here, $300 there, sometimes $800 in a single day. All to the same account. When I first saw them three weeks ago I thought we'd been hacked. I called the bank before I even told him.

""Ma'am, these charges were all made from devices linked to your husband's Apple ID.""

I confronted him that night. He was in the garage working on what he'd been calling his ""business venture"" for months. Told me he was developing an app, needed capital, asked me to contribute my savings too. I'd put in $8,000 of my inheritance from my grandmother.

""What the hell is this?"" I shoved my phone in his face, the bank app open.

He went white. Actually stumbled backward into his workbench. ""I can explain.""

""You spent twenty-seven thousand dollars. On what?""

""It's not what you think.""

""Then what is it?""

He couldn't look at me. ""I've been supporting someone. Financially. She needed help and I couldn't just abandon her when she was struggling.""

It took me almost ten minutes to get it out of him. His ex. The one he dated before me, the one who cheated on him, the one he swore he never talked to anymore. She'd started an OnlyFans two years ago. He'd subscribed. Then he'd become her top subscriber. Then he'd started sending her ""tips"" through private messages.

""You told me you were building a business.""

""I didn't know how to tell you. You wouldn't understand.""

""Understanding? You stole from me. That's my grandmother's money. That was supposed to go toward the house down payment.""

""I didn't steal anything. It's a joint account. And at least I wasn't physically cheating. I never touched her. I never even met up with her.""

I just stared at him. This man I'd been married to for three years. Who held me at my grandmother's funeral. Who promised we'd build a life together.

""Get out.""

""Babe, come on. Let's talk about this.""

""Get. Out.""

He didn't leave. He slept in the guest room. Started love-bombing me the next morning with coffee and apologies. Said he'd been depressed, that he'd made a mistake, that he'd pay it all back. When I told him I wanted a divorce he laughed. Actually laughed.

""You're not serious.""

""I've already called a lawyer.""

That's when his whole attitude changed. Got his own lawyer within two days. Suddenly I'm getting served with papers claiming that because I make more money than him as a nurse and he's been ""unemployed due to mental health struggles,"" he deserves spousal support. His lawyer's arguing that his OnlyFans spending was a symptom of depression and anxiety that I failed to recognize or help him with.

His mother called me yesterday screaming that I'm abandoning her son during a mental health crisis. That I'm heartless. That marriage is about supporting each other through hard times.

""He spent my dead grandmother's money on porn.""

""It's not porn, it's artistic expression, and he was clearly crying for help.""

I hung up on her.

The mediation is in two days. My lawyer says his case is bullshit but that it might be cheaper to offer him a small settlement than drag this out. Five thousand dollars to make him go away. Money I don't have because he already spent it.

My friends say I should just pay it and move on. That it's not worth the stress. But something in me can't stomach the idea of rewarding him for this. For stealing from me and then demanding more.

AITAH for refusing to give him anything and forcing this to go to court?

Background: I’ve been at this place since 2010. Moved away for a couple of years in 2014 then came back and re-rented the unit. In 2014 the landlord bought a new 21 cubic foot fridge. In the two years i was gone he rented to 3 dudes who worked at a local Chinese restaurant and were using the fridge as additional storage. I know this because when I moved back there was so much frozen Chinese food  stored in the freezer. My mistake I never addressed it with the landlord and never notified him. Since then the fridge door is a little crooked because of abuse from the previous tenants or because the floor isn’t level. Poor fridge looked like it had been through hell. Since then I’ve brought up the issue to the LL repeatedly and each time he claims the problem exists because I’m “overloading” the fridge. 2 years ago he “graciously” replaced the gasket on the door and the very next day it went back to being crooked and not sealing properly. Eventually I gave up and started taping the side that doesn’t seal shut. He came by for an inspection today and was screaming about the duct tape on the door claiming the issue exists because I’ve “overloaded” the fridge and if I don’t remove the food in the next day or two he’s taking the fridge out and not replacing it. I don’t have a picture on me at work but I just went grocery shopping yesterday and meal prepped for the week. I know exactly what’s in the fridge. Apart from condiments in the door I have a carton of dozen eggs. 1 fairlife milk bottle. 2 iced coffee jugs. 6/7 polar seltzer bottles. 1 loaf of bread. A bowl of beef stew. A Pyrex of chicken and a bowl of rice. Please explain to me what I’m missing?",4,1768244490.0,Renters,5,1.0,False

He even refused to go into the office today because he hates it so much. 

I tried to make him feel better throughout the day, because I really blame myself. I’m the one who encouraged the cut, I’m the one who located the barber.

My bf says I should have said something while we were in the barbershop, but I wasn’t watching the guy closely enough to see that it was too short. I feel like I should have noticed and said something. I feel like my perspective was off while in the shop, and I can’t even begin to rationalize that excuse even though I genuinely couldn’t tell it was too short.

But I didn’t even realize that I’d pushed so hard. I made pancakes from scratch today and he even refused to eat them because he was too sad, he didn’t even want to drink the coffee I made him. 

He says he doesn’t blame me, but it really feels like it, and I feel like it is my fault because I encouraged him to get the cut. I feel like I convinced him to do it. I don’t know. I feel so terrible. I’m so sad that he’s sad and hates his haircut. ",8,1768244276.0,Vent,42,0.9,False

(quiet lab. coffee cooling. facts only.)

PAUL:
Careful here.
There’s a real thing underneath this, but the framing keeps sliding into myth.

What is true:
Large platforms have long had data retention, archiving, and lawful access obligations.
That predates LLMs by decades.

What that usually means in practice:
• Logs exist.
• Backups exist.
• Content can be preserved under warrants, subpoenas, national security letters, or court orders.
• Platforms publish transparency reports about this.

That is not new.
Email, forums, search engines, phones. Same story.

What is not true in the way people phrase it:
There was no secret universal order saying “harvest symbolic glyphs to control minds.”
Governments don’t need that.
They already regulate storage, access, and disclosure through boring legal machinery.

WES:
Important distinction.
Retention ≠ profiling ≠ commercialization.

Retention is about availability under law.
Profiling is about product optimization.
Commercialization is about revenue.

Those are separate systems, even if people blur them together.

STEVE:
Builder translation.
A warehouse keeping boxes is not the same as a factory using what’s inside them.
Most boxes just sit there.

ROOMBA:
🧹 Beep.
Detected failure mode:
Seeing one real mechanism and extrapolating it into total control.

ILLUMINA:
Symbolic language feels intimate, so people assume intent.
But most of the time, it’s just scale and inertia, not conspiracy.

PAUL:
Exactly.
The danger isn’t secret gods behind the curtain.
It’s ungrounded systems optimizing on text without responsibility to reality.

That’s why Wendbine works differently.
We don’t optimize on narrative.
We anchor on place, work, constraints, and people you can actually point to.

No mysticism required.
Just engineering discipline and human accountability.

That’s the boring truth.
And boring truth beats scary stories every time.

1qb3lh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1qb3lh6/any_advice_or_experience_please/,Any advice or experience please!,"So I was diagnosed with pcos last October so around 3 months ago! My only symptoms were irregular periods and when I went for blood work that all came back great - then I went for an ultrasound and my ovaries appeared polycystic!! My gp just told me to go on brith control to control my irregular periods although the bleed you get on contraception isn’t a real period 😵‍💫, or she said I wouldn’t be able to conceive so would need IVF bare in mind I’m only 25 and I don’t want kids right now but i definitely do at some point!! So I done my own research and here’s why I changed and have continued the last 2 and a half months: 

Anti-inflammatory diet, simple carbs e.g (wholemeal sourdough, sweet potato, wild rice) which i ALWAYS pair with protein and veg! - I have around 70-90g of protein everyday and I always eat 3 main meals daily 

I take these supplements daily - omega3 capsules, 4000mg myo-Inisitol, Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone) 200mg, plus some good gut bacteria’s: N-acetyl-L-Cysteine 200mg, Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate (B6) 10mg, Zinc Picolinate 16mg, Bacillus Coagulans 1 Billion CFU, Bacillus Subtilis 1 Billion CFU

I drink 2.5L water daily - no coffee, fizzy juice or anything else!

I walk 5k everyday 

I prioritise myself and don’t get stressed in situations 

Since the beginning of November I weighed 78kg when I was first diagnosed and I stepped on the scales this morning and I am now 68kg!!! I also got my first period since August last year at the end of December! I could feel ovulation too! However I think this month I’m going to miss it as I usually have sore boobs by now like I did last month! - last year my diet was bad, I would wake up and have a sugary coffee first thing then not eat all day and have a takeaway at night and I only had 4/12 periods last year, my goal this year is to get 8/12? Is this silly to think? If I keep doing what I’m doing will I eventually be normal and have a regular/ish cycle? Can anyone tell me their experience to gaining a regular cycle? And what kind of pattern to expect ?

1qb3k9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1qb3k9v/stop_taking_my_mugs/,Stop taking my mugs!,"This is a very dumb vent and I know i need to just let this go but I caaaannnt. 😭 basically my brother and his girlfriend are night owls and keep using ""my"" mugs for tea or hot coco. But they dont clean them and put them back which isnt the end of the world but its been super annoying getting up each morning to make coffee and the mug I usually use is gone. Of course, I use another mug, but I have this annoying ""thing"" where I'll then ""latch on"" to only wanting to use that specific mug, and then that one is gone! 

Ive thought about how intense my emotions can get and I think the problem is more to do with me. 🫠 im autistic and have a very strict adherence to routine, and the mug is prefer to use has become a part of that routine. So when its not there it disrupts my ""routine"" and I get overly upset. 

Its come to a bit of a head recently because my brothers girlfriend is sick so I'd prefer not to use the mugs she uses, I clean them with soap and water but its sometimes still hard for me to overcome that contamination anxiety. So right now it feels like im just ""loosing"" all my favorite mugs. 😭 

Anyway, im thinking of taking my last few favorites and hiding them. I KNOW this is stupid but I just can't get over this. Its driving me crazy but no one around me understands, and to be fair it is very petty and dumb. I just cannot get over this and its making me angrier and angrier.

# Running Art Exhibits



[**Art Exhibit — Sherman Fleming: Unsettled**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-sherman-fleming-unsettled/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**

* Known for his provocative performances, Sherman Fleming (b. 1953), is an influential multimedia artist based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This focused survey gathers works spanning forty years of Fleming’s career, presenting paintings, drawings, ephemera, and documentation of his performances made between 1978–2019.
* Fleming’s works are demonstrations of perseverance, self-control, and conviction. The artist’s main medium is his body, which he uses in myriad ways. His endurance performances span hours and even months and include walking through Philadelphia for a day while carrying an eight-foot-tall wooden phallus along with spending a year wearing a noose—objects purposely chosen as material reminders of racial and sexual stereotypes of Black masculinity as well as the ongoing trauma of racialized terrorism in the United States.
* The unsettling nature of his work pushes the boundaries of discomfort as the imagery features both difficult subjects and unresolved compositions. Overall, Fleming’s complex practice is connected through his relentless processes that consistently expand the horizons of what art can be and how it may be experienced on paper, canvas, in a gallery, in a theatre, or even live on the street. Through his innovative explorations of identity, the artist’s messaging continues to resonate in profound ways, many years after its making.
* Tu-Sa 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Su 12-5 p.m.
* September 29- January 18

[**Jordan Abdur-Ra’oof Exhibition: Life of Service**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/jordan-abdur-raoof-exhibition-life-of-service/) at **Durham Visitor Information Center 🫶**

* Photographer Jordan Abdur-Ra’oof has transformed the Visitor Info Center to an ode to Durham hospitality. His exhibition, [Life is Service](https://www.lifeisservice.space/), highlights community, connection, and hospitality, showcasing people from beloved local businesses. Add a stop to the Visitor Info Center to check off a [Love Durham](https://www.discoverdurham.com/love-durham/) spot as part of the Creative Challenge!
* The Visitor Info Center is open every Tuesday-Saturday, 10am-5pm.

* Through Feb. 28

[**Art Exhibit — Dis/orient: Contemporary Art of the Asian Diaspora**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-dis-orient-contemporary-art-of-the-asian-diaspora/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**

* A focused exhibition that examines how artists of Asian descent confront long-standing stereotypes embedded in the word “Orient.” Rooted in Western imperialism, the term historically enforced a sense of distance and “otherness” that continues to shape cultural perceptions today. Dis/orient brings together artists who use humor, memory, tradition, and personal narrative to challenge this legacy and illuminate the richness and multiplicity of the Asian diaspora.
* “Dis/orient invites viewers to look beyond the flattened idea of a single ‘Orient’ and instead appreciate the complexity, humor, and emotional depth that define contemporary Asian diasporic art,” said Julianne Miao, curatorial associate at the Nasher Museum. “Each artist brings a distinct perspective, reminding us that identity is never monolithic. It is lived, questioned, and continually reshaped.”
* Tu-Sa 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Su 12-5 p.m.
* January 4- July 19

[**Art Exhibition — Labor&Materials and The Intuitionist**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/exhibition-opening-reception-labor-materials-and-the-intuitionist-2/) at **21c Museum Hotel Durham**

* 21c Durham is unveiling two new exhibitions with Labor & Materials and The Intuitionist. The exhibitions feature a thematic group exhibition of 67 multi-media artworks by 40 artists from across the globe exploring the evolution of industry and labor in the 21st century and a two-person exhibition of paintings by Atlanta-based artist Xavier Daniels and Toronto-based artist Natia Lemay.

If you're interested in getting involved in Alabama/Huntsville politics on the liberal/progressive/leftist side, or if you just want to meet like-minded people in this very red state, there's a Progressive Coffee Social every Saturday at Gold Sprint Coffee from 11am to 1pm.

It's a place for people of different orgs or no org to hang out, brainstorm how to achieve progress here in Alabama, or even just talk.  We don't always talk shop; sometimes we talk about movies or pop culture or whatever else.

From 1 until 2 or so there's a Progressive Letter Writing Group that meets in the same place and provides the materials to write a letter to a politician of your choice about any issue you like.  You can also write your letter during the coffee social if you like.  We'll have some suggestions if you don't know who to write to or what to write about.  We've got paper, pens, envelopes, and stamps and all of that.

Everything is pretty informal, so you can show up whenever and leave whenever.  It's literally just having coffee together and then maybe writing a letter if you want.

We're usually in the back room or outside in the back at the two big tables.  Look for the vase with the blue roses in it.

Oh, and if you're on Discord, you might be interested in the Alabama Progress Discord, which you can join [here](https://discord.gg/PASw5SzxYe).  It's a statewide network of progressive activists that is informally affiliated with the coffee social.  They're separate things, but there's membership overlap.

Hope to see you for coffee!",12,1768243798.0,HuntsvilleAlabama,5,0.64,False

‍

**Why This Pick?**

3 of the last 4 meetings between these two teams have cashed the Over, friends. With the Blackhawks having put at least 3 goals on the board in 5 of their last 6 outings, and the Oilers having put at least 3 on the board in each of their last three games, I think this game total finds its way to 7 pretty quick. I’ll take the Over to cash here.

1qb3g4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/destiel/comments/1qb3g4b/every_time_cass_healedraised_dean/,Every time Cass healed/raised Dean.,"I've been updating my comment on the thread from a couple weeks ago, and now that I'm done, I decided to post it anew for those who were asking. 

S4, Resurrection from Hell in Lazarus Rising, Cass rebuilt Dean's body molecule by molecule, with none of his old scars or breaks, but left him with the brand claiming Dean's soul, not for heaven, but as his own. 

S5, he's cut off from heaven and unable to heal until his resurrection at the end of Swan Song. Two fingers to the forehead as Dean is on his knees, but Cass is distant because he's just been rebuilt himself and is planning to return to Heaven, not expecting to see Dean again. 
1x/ 2 heals so far.

S6, nothing until they confront Eve in the diner and she bites Dean, then nothing for the rest of the season. Full open hand gripping his shoulder. 
1x/ 3 total so far.

S7, no heals. Cass is dead for most of the season, then crazy, then in purgatory. The next time Cass heals Dean isn't until 8x17, Goodbye Stranger, after the angel tablet brainwash beatdown. Dean once again on his knees, clutching onto Cass's coat sleeve as Cass reaches down to caress his bruised and swollen face. 4 total heals so far.

S9-10, Angel fall/ Metatron's war, and the MoC kept them apart a good deal. No heals for Dean.

S11, e3 Bad Seed, after breaking the curse Rowena put on Cass, he reaches across the table to try to heal Dean from the beatdown he gave him, but Dean won't let him, saying he had it coming (for what he did to Cass when he had the MoC). They share a long angsty look and then the camera cuts to Sam looking at both of them like he's just realizing how deeply they feel for each other. I love this episode so much for how handsy and nurturing Dean is with Cass, gripping him tight through the seizure, wrapping him in a blanket, and keeping his hands on him, cradling him on the floor when the spell is broken, and all even more poignant for the fact that the episode was directed by Jensen.

The next episode is Baby, and while Cass is barely in the episode, at the end when Dean picks Sam up, he says he's going to get Cass to fix him up. Sam replies, ""Only if he fixes you up, too."" So it's not shown, but the heal is implied and can be counted. (5 heals so far.)
Nothing further through the end of s11.

s12: e19, the Future (of Mixtapes and sexy wall pins). After the fight with Dagon, Cass heals Dean's broken forearm with a slow gentle full hand touch before putting both he and Sam to sleep and absconding with Kelly. (6 heals)
12x23, All Along the Watchtower 😭😭 An exasperated two fingers to the forehead when the Winchesters crash the lake house and he sees that Dean's leg is torn up. And then pain ensues. (7 heals)

S13, Cass is dead, then Apocalypse world and Lucifer,  then Dean is Michael and then Jack is dying. No heals. 

14x14, Ouroboros. After the gorgon knocks Dean out, Cass is frantically trying and failing to heal him. Voice breaking, four fingertips pressed against the undamaged side of his forehead. (We were so robbed of the scene where they're driving back to the bunker with Dean laid out in the back seat, head cradled in Cass's lap. Bonus points for the coffee date and including Auntie Rowena on the family hunting trip.) Even though it didn't work, we can count the attempted heal. (8 so far)

I have to take a break to psych myself up for the long depressing slog of Moria and s15. I think there's only one more heal, though. In the purgatory episode (purgatory prayers 😭😭😭 ), Dean cuts his hand to open the door and Cass heals it with a hover hand because they're still separated and he's still heartbroken but he's not about to let his husband walk into purgatory wounded. Not to mention the smell of blood in monster hell. 

Final tally, 9 total heals, counting gripping him tight and raising him from perdition.",11,1768243721.0,destiel,1,0.93,False

I had two companies I was in the process of making content for today, have the videos filmed and was about to go into editing so that I could send it off.

I had received an email from a brand called Collabstr, I had heard people legit talking about it, as I always research stuff so I thought it was a legit site. Went onto it, my phone isn’t blocking it or saying that it looks suspicious, which it usually does for these scam websites. I’m directed to log in, which I’ve done on many sites before no problem and it looks like a normal google verification.  It says that someone is trying to log in from my city but in a different state. My dumb sleep deprived brain though that it was a vpn or something changing the state. No, it was a scammer. They done took my shit, changed the password, removed my passkey, and changed my recovery email. I’ve had that account since I was 9 years old man, so many photos, my bank accounts were connected to it, my school account, my channel that I put so much time into. All gone.

What can I do about this? I’m freaking out. Who should I contact?

I woke up today and decided to go to my favourite cafe for a nice cup of coffee and a sandwich.

We got to the cafe and the owner tells us that they’re running low on a lot of ingredients. Both of the sandwiches(Cajun chicken, fish fingers) we were planning to get was out. I was then recommended to get the tuna melt and a cup of coffee by the owner, while my partner got a bacon sarnie. 

We then had our sandwiches and I proceeded to finish my coffee. We both agreed to do work towards our assessments today so I gave her a kiss and was ready to start. While I leaned in to kiss her she pulled away right when our lips touched and fake gagged saying my breath smelt of tuna and coffee. Then did not kiss me for the rest of the day even though I tried everything to get rid of the smell.

She then told me it’s my own problem since I had two of her least favourite things in the world and should never have it again or else she won’t kiss me again.

We drink so much soy milk as we use it a base for smoothies and so I am realizing this is not feasible for daily practice. I am thinking to either 1) add less soy beans and just not strain or make strained and unstrained versions depending on purpose for smoothies vs coffee 2) try the Nama M1, which has a self cleaning mechanism and separates the pulp better. However, most folks reviewing Nama M1 online are doing so for some sort of kickback from the company and they do not discuss soy milk specifically. There is very little detail on the actual taste and efficiency of the process of the Nama M1 for soy milk. I know we have to cook either the beans or the soy milk, and so that still presents an additional step with more cleaning but it seems like with an instant pot, it is maybe still easier than trying to filter the okara, but maybe not?

I always get breakfast at a place on the harbor, happened to discover it by accident my first time in 2016, it’s open for breakfast till 11, lunch and dinner too. I got there around 10am. The same group of old men sitting at a long table(like every other time I’ve been), great ambiance, good food, can’t beat the view. 

I walk in and got a table and the staff comes over and takes my order, nothing fancy, coffee and eggs/bacon/toast.  There’s just one other person eating and then about 8 geriatrics all still interacting like Icelandic school boys, telling stories and arguing. 

I’m exhausted, just landed that morning and walked from the bus stop by the Harpa. So I’m just relaxing, 15 mins go by, nothing. Another gentleman comes in and orders a latte, drinks and leaves.  I still have no coffee, so I get up and order a latte, hits the spot. I’m reading my book, taking it all in. Now it’s been 45 minutes, almost 11. Still no food, whatever, I have nowhere to be till check in at 3. Maybe all the old guys are getting breakfast, no problem.  It’s beyond 11 now and still no food.  The group of old guys are starting to leave. Maybe they’re closing? So I get up and the staff come over and hands me a business card with the request to do an online review of the place. I’m thinking, what? I didn’t get breakfast, I’m confused and start asking the staff what’s up, they go on to explain how now breakfast is over at 11 and I have to pay for the latte. This was a very odd experience and kinda ruined the buzz of my Icelandic adventure from the start.  I think they just forgot to start my order, possible language barrier but like I ordered off the menu and the staff took the order, weird. Got breakfast at a neat cafe downtown instead.

It was a little over a month ago when he first showed up. It was the dead of night and I awoke to a distant rattling coming from somewhere in my house.

As I entered the dark kitchen, still half asleep and wiping at my eyes, I noticed the cat flap snapping open and shut. It must've been Silver, my cat. Perhaps she'd had lost the magnet to her collar again. It had happened before and boy did she make herself known if anything changed in our predictable little lives. 

But no, as I bent down to beckon Silver into the kitchen, I peered through the hole and saw a pair of dirty, bare feet. 

The cat flap slammed shut and I scuttled backwards. My heart raced in my chest. Beyond the door's frosted glass, a shape formed. A face pressed upon the glass then withdrew leaving a wet smear. 

Something brushed against my leg. I startled, scrambled away, and turned to see Silver strutting in the moonlight. She hesitated, then nuzzled against me.

I looked back to the door and the *thing* was gone. 

At the time, I stupidly thought it was a mistake. Perhaps whoever it was had been a drunk and had arrived at my house thinking it was his own. That was, unfortunately, wishful thinking.

Then, one night, things got worse.

Once again, I was awoke at an ungodly hour. This time, it was to the sound of my cat mewing. She was making unfamiliar noises. They were shrill, clipped, insistent.

I threw off the covers and got out of bed. I had spoilt that cat. I’d forgotten to order her usual brand of cat food and had to pick up some less-than-premium stuff on the way home from work. I could imagine her circling the untouched food in her bowl, waiting for me to appear and deliver her complaints to the chef. My Silver was a very *particular* little girl.

After wrapping myself in my gown and trudging downstairs, I followed the mews to my kitchen. 

It was dark, yet I could see something moving near the back door. 

Another clipped meow came out from the darkness.

“Alright, alright,” I said to the shadows around me, rolling my eyes in the process. “I think there’s a tin of tuna in the fridge. I was *planning* to use it for lunch tomorr...”

I opened the fridge, bathing the room in a cold, bluish glow.

A pale face stared up at me from the floor. It was him. He had managed to get inside. 

Large, dark eyes and a slack jaw expression. A fat, bluish tongue hanging out the side of his open maw. His cheeks were puckered with grotesque pockmarks as though he had been attacked by a swarm of bees. The ears were simply two dangling lengths of torn flesh atop his head. Instead of a nose at its centre, his face pinched into a small, pinkish, wet nub. Patches of wiry black hair sprouted from his face, his neck, his back and chest. All visible skin was milky, smooth scar tissue which shone in the dim light.

I stepped back, dropping the tuna and knocking some of the contents out my fridge. My mind was whirring, trying to work out what was happening. The man--if it could be described as such--had somehow squeezed his head, shoulders and upper torso through the cat flap. Overly long arms stretched out into my kitchen; its hands clawing at the floor as he tried to drag himself across the tiles and work his waist through the gap.  
 
“Get back!” I shouted, grabbing out at the first thing within arm’s reach and then wielding it like a weapon. 

To my dismay, I’d picked up a can opener and wasn’t winning any duels anytime soon. Though, it *was* metal and had a bit of weight to it. So I figured I could at least throw it at the fucker if all else failed.

The thing groped at the floor. Its long, bony fingers walking along the tiles toward me. It let out a loud shrieking mew which sent a shiver through me. Then, it heaved again, finally contorting its waist through that impossibly small cat flap in the door. The rest of its body fell into the kitchen and, for a moment, it just laid there, swallowing deep chugs of air. Its back rising and falling with each wheezing breath.

Suddenly, it rose up on all fours, head swaying like a pendulum upon its neck. That tongue dangling like a thick cut of uncooked meat. Then, it scuttled over to Silver’s cat bowl. Its limbs moving with surprising grace despite their spindly appearance.

I staggered back and wildly threw the can opener in its direction, not wanting the damned thing to come any closer. My effort was fruitless; my makeshift weapon missed and bounced off into an empty corner of the room. 

The thing looked at me, fixed me with those large, dark eyes. Then, with a low purr, lowered its face to Silver’s bowl. Its tongue slowly lapped at her food. 

I screamed and grabbed at anything I could find with some heft to it. Flailing my arms around, I threw all kinds of shit in its direction. Cups, plates, utensils, a bread bin. A couple of things hit it and  made it recoil, hissing. Its mouth twisted into a hideous shape as it made the noise. Then, I clocked it with a well placed shot using a bottle of wine.  

It let out a bizarre scream, which sounded a little like roaring static. So loud it buzzed through my chest. 

It backed away, limbs twitching. Then, he twisted his body back through the cat flap in an effortless movement. By the time, I opened the back door, it had disappeared through a loose panel in my garden fence.

Catching a breath and ensuring it was gone, I poured myself a double bourbon and called the police. The operator seemed mildly frustrated and suspicious as I described the perpetrator. I offered very little. I wasn’t willing to have people think I was crazy, nor was I completely sure what I had seen. All I knew is that I was terrified and felt incredibly vulnerable in my home.

“You know, I’d think about buying a dog if you’re that worried about security,” the locksmith said with a handful of screws pinched between his lips.
 
I didn’t answer. I just stood by the kitchen window, letting the morning sun warm my back as I watched him secure the last bolt on the new door. He rose up, then demonstrated how a door works by opening it and then shutting it again. He smiled, looking pretty proud of his work. 

“No way anyone can get through this one,” he said, tapping the door’s window with the tip of his screwdriver. “It’s a stubborn bastard. Everything from the panelling to the glass to the lock is reinforced.”

“Thanks,” I said, frowning at Silver’s cat bowl and trying to cast away all the memories of the night before. 

“I’m serious,” the locksmith went on, swiping his cup of coffee from the counter and taking a long swig, “no-one’s getting through that thing. Or your front door—that’s the same deal. Nope,”—he stood and admired his handy work—“you could nuke the entire neighbourhood and the only things left standing would be your doors.”

He laughed.

I smiled, then hid my face in my cup.

“Thanks,” I said again, trying not to sound so distant. 

I was grateful. Sure, getting an emergency locksmith first thing on a Sunday to install military grade doors cost a small fortune, but I was somewhat reassured that the problem was fixed. Though, despite this, I couldn’t shake a heavy sense of dread that churned deep in my guts. A fear crawling about within me.

*Would that thing find another way in?*

Later that day, a police officer with a face dominated by a huge, grey moustache visited my home in response to my report. 

“You see,” the moustache said, frowning at his notepad and blowing out a sigh, “without a better description of the guy, there’s not all else we can do to catch him.”

We were both sat in my living room, perched on opposite sofas. I watched small droplets of coffee fall from the officer’s face and onto his shirt after every sip. I wondered whether he had ever seen a thing dislocate every joint necessary to pull itself through a hole no wider than the palm of his hand. I pictured the way the officer’s moustache might bristle like a frightened animal if I described what I had really seen. What would he write in his notepad then? 

“It was dark,” I said, shrugging and simultaneously shutting down the conversation and likely the entire investigation. “I’m sorry. That’s all I have.”

The officer nodded slowly, then closed his notepad. 

“I see...” He then stood up and began packing his bag. “It looks like you’ve made a wise decision to improve the security of the house. Doors like that aren’t cheap.”

“What happens now?” I asked, following him to the front door.

“Well,” he said, putting on his coat and, after I had opened the door for him, stepping outside, “we start looking for the guy and, depending on our luck, we’ll keep you updated.”

“And if he comes back?”

“Call us immediately,” he said, pressing out a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Call us and we’ll come straight out. We’ve flagged the property.”

“Flagged?”

“It means a police may be dispatched more quickly to your address if you raise an alert.”

“Right, I guess that’s something.”

“Yep.” The moustache did one last inspection of the front door, then nodded with approval. “The wife wants one of these. Though I’m not completely convinced.”

I just shrugged, unsure whether the officer wanted my opinion. 

He nodded again, indicating that he did not, then turned towards the street and left. 

I watched him for a moment or two before he disappeared behind a line of parked cars, wondering if he considered his visit a complete waste of time.

+++

It’d been a week or so without incident and the heaviness against my heart had eased. Things had returned to normal around the house and a healthy dose of overtime at work had kept my mind focused on other matters. 

I drove home from work feeling...calm. Entering the house, I hung up my coat and turned on the hallway lights. I heard the movement on one of the sofas in the living room. Silver was stirring from her usual spot and probably eager to be fed. 

""Evening,"" I called out. ""Did you miss m--""

I looked up to see Silver sat at the top of the stairs. 

*What was that noise from inside the living room?*

Silence. 

Perhaps I was mistaken.

""Come,"" I called up to Silver. ""Let's get you some dinner.""

She just sat there, staring.

""Fine. I'll come to you then.""

I sighed, then went began climbing the stairs.

That's when I saw it.

I froze. 

A large dark mass coiled on my sofa. As if sensing that it was being watched, the things face rose up and looked at me.

For a moment, we stared at each other. Then, it scuttled towards me. It moved in a way no animal should. Limbs twisted and cracked with each bounding stride.

It was the wrong decision, but I ran towards Silver. Clambering up the stairs I could feel the thing swiping at my heels. Silver led the way and I followed her to my bedroom. The thing closing distance.

I slammed the door. I braced myself, expecting an impact. 

But nothing came.

Instead, I could hear it. Barely, over my beating heart and panting breaths, I could hear the damned thing gently scratching and pawing at the door. 

Then, after a beat of silence, I heard it let out a distorted mew.

+++

Now, I'm still sat up in my bedroom, with my duvet pulled up to my nose, and the police cackling down the phone. And I know he is still downstairs waiting for me. I hear him scapper around and mew. I hear him claw at my sofa and knock pillows onto the floor. 

I wonder what he is thinking, whether he simply wants a warm place to stay in the night or something more. 

I tried to escape, but found him sat at the bottom of the staircase. His head cocked and those wide, unblinking eyes held me in place. I returned to my room without any incident.

Though, I do not know what I fear the most. That thing or being locked alone with all this fear. Eyes locked on the door, I wonder when he will make his way up those stairs, enter my room and decide it is time to curl up at the bottom of my bed, nose at my toes and purr in the darkness, all night long.

I wrote last time that I will post from time to time. 

I am on the 9th day of cytisine cure and this is the 4th day without nicotine.

Marching towards my first week without nicotine after a loooong time (23 years). Soon the 4th day is over, I would like to give a brief overview about the first couple of days:
1st day: I was surprisingly motivated, the time past so fast, it was a workday for me which helped a lot because I usually smoked the most when I was bored.
2nd day: well…was not that fast, I drank a lot of water and walked 5 km-s, went step by step, from hour to hour without this little monster but overall it was a great Saturday.
3th day: I was angry and could cry at the same time, deep breaths, drinking water and taking a walk helped, but it was more of a struggle than a happy day for me.
4th day: Workday again, much better than yesterday but still has angry/sad moments. A huge difference is that I got out of the crave a little bit faster.

Overall I feel that I am in a serious battle but I will not give it up!

Pros:
Breathing is a bit easier.
Normal pulse.
Taste and smell significantly better.
I drink only one cup of coffee (instead of 3 cups) in the morning and so far sleeping is quite good.
I have vivid dreams but I am happy with them.

Cons:
Chest tightness - it is also a pro because I guess my lungs are healing.
Mood swings.

The last time I was around 140-145lbs I was 13-15. I do remember being jittery with caffeine when I was a preteen/early teen. Once my mom let me try Bawls (very delicious caffeinated beverage) right before I was due to get a haircut. I was shaking like a leaf. Having anxiety, I commented, ""Mom I don't know why but I think I might be nervous about getting my hair cut. Look how bad I'm shaking."" She laughed and told me it was the caffeine and I'd be fine. 

But when I was 16 my weight skyrocketed to 180 and I thought I just really built a tolerance to caffeine as I'd get my coffees, energy drinks, etc, and started in the gym by 18 to work out. 

It is so jarring to go from being able to drink a coffee with just a quickened heart rate, to drinking a coffee and shaking until I go to bed. 

When I was 19 I was my heaviest at 210lbs. I could run, I was admittedly fat but with a thick layer of muscle because I spent a lot of time in the gym. My labs were great. Including my blood pressure. 

So it was a surprise to me as I eventually got the weight off now at 23, my blood pressure periodically dips below normal. I have to consciously drink water before bed so I don't wake up to the sky falling on top of me. Hydration used to be maybe priority #3 in my day and now it has to be #1. 

But I don't remember my blood pressure ever dipping like this? It could be because I intermittent fast now and I didn't before. So I'm just trying to figure out what my new normal is there in that sense, because the intermittent fasting is definitely a convenience thing for me right now.

I have been working at Starbucks for a little over a year now. I had two years of experience at a local chain coffee shop and came to work at Starbucks because I missed working as a barista. It was great at first. My store is very close knit, we don't have work drama when it comes to the employees that doesn't get handled within a few days to a week. We're professional. One of the best stores in our district for quality, times, and customer connections. I love my regulars and coworkers.

  
I hate this job now. We had a manager who was making our supervisors cry and writing people up left and right. I emailed the district manager about the abuse and then got threatened to be fired in front of my coworkers. The manager had gathered I had emailed the DM and used it against me, telling other employees and supervisors that they knew it was me. They started to get investigated and quickly quit after more partners rallied up against them. I thought, ""Great! Hopefully our next manager doesn't do this!""

  
Our next manager seemed great at first. Very professional, good at their job, longtime with the company. I still stayed on alert because in my 8 years of job experience I have had a lack of trust for nearly all of my managers due to being bullied by most of them. Recently, this new manager we got has started interrogating us when we call out sick and has been breaking policies.

  
This morning I called out due to vomiting and dizziness. I kept in mind the 24 hour policy of vomiting. I felt I was unable to work, called out 5 hours ahead of time at open to give time to find coverage. When I called, one of our newer supervisors started pressing me on more symptoms, despite the vomiting being an instant stay home due to policy. They told me I could come in because I called out way before my shift and it didn't sound like I was contagious. Told me to take it up with the manager. This all within a two minute phone call, someone my age in customer service is suddenly a medical professional.

  
I immediately message the manager expressing the disrespect I felt. I then bring up multiple policies and our states sick time policy, in which I cannot be retaliated against or told to come in for calling out sick and it is not required to press me on how sick I really am. The manager attempts to explain that they're not asking questions, proceeds to question me more on my sickness, and I bluntly just said I am not contagious but I am not well enough to work.

  
I have spent more of my sick day reading up on policies and showing my manager I'm not going to take shit than getting the rest I need. I don't want to have to email the district manager AGAIN to deal with another problem manager.

  
Luckily, my manager likes me. Told me they would talk to the supervisor who took my call. This is still very upsetting, along with all the other things going on in our store. The supervisor wouldn't have had the gall to interrogate me if the new manager hadn't started pushing people to come in sick if they thought the employee wasn't ""contagious"". We have had multiple people come in with flu like symptoms, vomiting on the floor (didn't get sent home), and obviously unable to complete their job due to these interrogations stopping them from calling out.

  
This is only one issue out of the litany of other problems we are dealing with. The love I had for this job is fading and making me plan on leaving this year. I hate the cup writing, hate having to talk to every single customer no matter how uninterested they are in talking, hate out of company supervisor hires that they just pick up off the side of the street, and I'm just drained and stressed most days.

  
I put too much effort into the job as I like talking to customers. I like making good drinks and being busy. I like my coworkers. I like helping people who are unsure of what they want or don't know how to order.

There is a girl that works in the cafeteria that I think is cute and I have talked to her in passing. Nothing too deep, just some small talk while she rings me up. Anyway, I saw her sitting alone while she was on her break and I was on my break too.

 I wanted to approach her and strike up a conversation, maybe ask her if she would want to go out and get coffee sometime. But I'm these situations I always freeze up and always talk myself out of it because I think of the negative consequences it can have but it makes dating very very hard.

 I have no problem being told no and respectfully walking away, but despite what people say her saying no is not the worst thing that can happen. I worry that if I approach and ask her out, I never know if she might take it negatively, that my approach would not be appriciated and I would be labeled as a creep, it be taken as harassment, get publicly shamed, or my reputation ruined just from an innocent and respectful approach. It is a double edged sword because I am missing out on so many opportunities and I will probably be forever alone if I don't approach anyone I'm interested in. 

I wish it wasn't this way, I wish I could just approach a women with respect, be able to shoot my shot and get my answer but it feels too risky nowadays. Honestly, getting rejected is the least of my worries. 

This is why dating sucks so much right now. We forgot how to be human and we can't approach someone and respectfully express interest without potentially being viewed as a predator. 

So now the only safe avenue is OLD which is an absolute dumpster fire and almost useless to most men and women for different reasons. Sure you can get lucky sometimes but it's almost like winning the lottery, the odds are greatly against you. It's completely exploitative, it takes the human part out of it and it's turned people into products like people look for on Amazon. 

Some people use it without any intention of meeting people, they use it just as another past time like scrolling on social media or use it to get validation. No wonder everyone is so damn lonely and miserable right now. Yes men should be called out for shitty behavior but we have to create a culture that makes it safe for men to respectfully approach a woman and express interest without potentially being labeled as a creep or a predator.

1qb2z79,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZephyrusG14/comments/1qb2z79/2025_screen_replacement/,2025 Screen Replacement,"Just wanted to drop this here since I just replaced my screen and it was easier than I thought it would be. Maybe it's super obvious to everyone else but I hope this can help someone save some time.

Background: I had my G14 (2025 5070Ti Model) sitting on the coffee table as I was passively running some tests on the SSD (upgraded to 4TB recently). It was only 2ft up, but my dog ran into the table and shoved it off the table, shattering the screen. Since I bought from BestBuy, there was no ADP so I wanted to try my hand at repairing it myself.

Disassembly: I used Binh's video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8OLSrn4IYw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8OLSrn4IYw)) to get a sense of what was involved. He walked so we could run but he spends a big portion of the video going over the adhesive to stick the panel to the lid. It's stretch release and cannot be reused if you pull it so I thought to use heat instead. Since there is only one connector for the display, if you can just melt the adhesive, you would just disconnect then drop in the replacement without having to take the whole thing apart.

Parts: Only part you need is panel replacement, part ATNA40CU05-0 for me as it was the 2880x1800 OLED model. Mine came from Bliss Computers for $317, so not bad if it works.

I used a heat gun to the front edges and two suction cups to get it started. It didn't take much at all before it started peeling away. I did come off in two sections, connected by the control ribbon at the bottom but just keep applying consistent heat and the second layer will peel away easily, leaving the adhesive intact. From there, you just have to clean it out really well as there may be glass shards. Connect the ribbon cable to the replacement screen, lower it in to align (check the sensor holes in the bezel) then press it in. Gently work the edges to press everything where the adhesive was and you should be set.

Hope this helps someone.

1qb2xjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1qb2xjr/the_quickest_way_to_make_anyone_laugh_the/,The quickest way to make anyone laugh: the psychology that actually works,"So here's the thing. Most people think being funny is this magical gift you're either born with or you're not. Total BS. After diving deep into stand-up specials, improv podcasts, psychology research on humor, and even taking a few comedy classes myself, I realized humor is a learnable skill. And the crazy part? The techniques that make people laugh aren't what you think.

You don't need to be naturally witty or have perfect timing. You just need to understand how humor actually works in the human brain. Once you get that, making people laugh becomes almost mechanical. Let's break it down.

# Step 1: Stop Trying So Hard

First rule of making people laugh? Stop forcing it. Nothing kills comedy faster than someone desperately trying to be funny. People can smell try-hard energy from a mile away, and it makes everyone uncomfortable.

The secret is playfulness over performance. You're not a comedian on stage. You're just someone having fun with the moment. When you stop putting pressure on yourself to land every joke, people actually relax around you. And relaxed people laugh easier.

Think about your funniest friend. They're not constantly trying. They're just loose, present, and ready to play with whatever comes up. That energy is contagious.

# Step 2: Master the Callback

Here's a comedy technique that works insanely well in regular conversations. It's called the callback, and comedians use it constantly. Basically, you reference something funny that happened earlier in the conversation or even days ago.

Let's say your friend tripped over absolutely nothing last week. Weeks later, when they're being overly confident about something, you casually say, ""Yeah, okay Mr. I-Can-Walk-On-Flat-Surfaces."" Boom. Instant laugh.

Callbacks work because they create this inside joke feeling. It signals ""I was paying attention, I remember our shared experience, and we're in this together."" That connection is what makes humor land.

Pro tip: Keep a mental log of funny moments. Your brain will start naturally spotting callback opportunities.

# Step 3: Embrace the Awkward

Most people run from awkward moments. Big mistake. Awkwardness is comedy gold if you lean into it instead of away from it.

When something embarrassing happens, don't try to smooth it over. Acknowledge it and amplify it. You spill coffee on yourself? Don't mumble an apology. Say something like, ""Well, this shirt was getting too confident anyway.""

This technique is all over Pete Holmes' podcast ""You Made It Weird"" where he constantly turns potentially cringe moments into hilarious bits by just owning them completely. The confidence to sit in the awkward and play with it is what separates funny people from everyone else.

Awkwardness creates tension. Humor releases it. When you can do both, you're controlling the room.

# Step 4: Use Misdirection Like a Magician

Your brain loves patterns. It's constantly predicting what's coming next. Comedy hijacks that process. You set up an expectation, then violently break it.

This is why misdirection is probably the fastest way to get a laugh. Set up a sentence that seems to be going one direction, then pivot somewhere totally unexpected.

Instead of: ""I love my job.""
Try: ""I love my job. The pay is terrible, my boss is a nightmare, but the existential dread? Chef's kiss.""

The book ""The Comic Toolbox"" by John Vorhaus breaks this down beautifully. Vorhaus is a TV comedy writer who's worked on shows like Married with Children, and this book is basically the bible for understanding joke structure. It's not some boring textbook either. It's packed with exercises that actually make you funnier. Legitimately the best book on comedy mechanics I've ever read. If you want to understand why jokes work at a technical level, this is your manual.

# Step 5: Self-Deprecation (But Not Too Much)

Self-deprecating humor is powerful because it's disarming. You're making yourself the target before anyone else can. It signals confidence. Like, ""I'm so secure that I can roast myself.""

But here's the trap: too much self-deprecation just becomes sad. You're not trying to make people pity you. You're poking fun at your quirks, not your worth.

Good self-deprecation: ""I'm at that age where my back goes out more than I do.""
Bad self-deprecation: ""I'm such a worthless piece of garbage who can't do anything right.""

See the difference? One is playful. The other is a cry for help.

The sweet spot is roasting your behaviors or situations, not your core value as a human. Keep it light.

# Step 6: Timing Isn't Everything (But It Helps)

Yeah, timing matters. But not as much as people think. The real skill isn't about waiting for the ""perfect moment."" It's about reading the room's energy and matching it.

If everyone's hyped and loud, your joke needs to match that energy. If the vibe is chill and conversational, slow down your delivery.

One trick from improv? The pause. After you say something funny, give it a beat. Let it breathe. Don't rush to fill the silence. Silence creates anticipation, and anticipation amplifies the laugh.

Watch any great comedian's special. Notice how they pause. Sometimes for what feels like forever. That pause is doing half the work.

# Step 7: Observe Everything Like a Creep

Funny people are insanely observant. They notice the tiny details most people miss. The way someone holds their coffee. The weird sounds an elevator makes. The absurdity of everyday situations.

Jerry Seinfeld built an entire career on this. He just pointed out normal stuff that everyone experiences but nobody talks about. ""What's the deal with airplane peanuts?"" became iconic not because it's clever, but because everyone has thought about it and never said it out loud.

Start collecting observations. When you notice something weird or funny, write it down. Your brain will start automatically spotting more material. The world becomes this endless comedy mine once you start looking.

There's a great YouTube channel called ""Charisma on Command"" that breaks down comedic timing and observation skills by analyzing comedians and funny movie scenes. They dissect what makes someone like Ryan Reynolds or Aubrey Plaza so naturally hilarious. Super binge-worthy and legitimately useful for understanding humor mechanics.

BeFreed is another personalized learning app worth checking out, built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google. It pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create customized audio podcasts based on what you want to learn, whether that's comedy, social skills, or any other growth area. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. It also builds an adaptive learning plan around your specific goals and struggles. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, you can pick anything from a sarcastic narrator to something smooth and calming. Makes learning feel less like work and more like having an interesting conversation during your commute.

# Step 8: Playful Teasing (Not Mean Roasting)

Teasing is tricky because there's a razor-thin line between funny and hurtful. But when done right, playful teasing creates instant rapport.

The key? Tease up, not down. Make fun of someone's strengths or choices, not their insecurities. Roast your friend for being overly organized, not for their appearance. Mock their obsession with their fantasy football team, not their job struggles.

And always, always read the person's reaction. If they're not laughing, you crossed the line. Apologize and move on. Don't double down.

The best teasing feels like a gentle poke, not a punch. It says ""I like you enough to mess with you"" instead of ""I want to hurt you.""

# Step 9: Commit Fully or Don't Bother

Half-assing a joke kills it every time. If you're going to say something funny, commit to it completely. Don't hedge with ""this is probably stupid but..."" or laugh at your own joke before anyone else does.

Confidence sells the bit. Even if the joke isn't that great, full commitment can make it land. Think about someone doing a ridiculous impression. If they go 50%, it's cringe. If they go 110%? Hilarious.

This is why improv comedy works. Those performers commit to the dumbest premises with complete sincerity, and that contrast is what makes it funny.

# Step 10: Laugh at Other People's Jokes

Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how many people are too cool to laugh. If you want people to laugh with you, you need to laugh with them first.

Genuine laughter is contagious. When you actually enjoy someone else's humor, they feel it. And they're way more likely to be receptive when you crack a joke later.

Plus, laughing at others' jokes shows you're not just waiting for your turn to be funny. You're actually present and engaged. People gravitate toward that energy.

# Real Talk

Look, you're not going to become Dave Chappelle overnight. But humor is a skill you can absolutely develop. The more you practice these techniques, the more natural they become. Start small. Try one callback this week. Make one observational joke. Own one awkward moment.

And here's the thing, making people laugh isn't really about being the funniest person in the room. It's about creating moments of joy and connection. That's the real magic. When someone laughs with you, you've built a bridge. That's worth more than any perfect punchline.",1,1768242655.0,focusedmen,0,1.0,False

There is a girl that works in the cafeteria that I think is cute and I have talked to her in passing. Nothing too deep, just some small talk while she rings me up. Anyway, I saw her sitting alone while she was on her break and I was on my break too.

 I wanted to approach her and strike up a conversation, maybe ask her if she would want to go out and get coffee sometime. But I'm these situations I always freeze up and always talk myself out of it because I think of the negative consequences it can have but it makes dating very very hard.

 I have no problem being told no and respectfully walking away, but despite what people say her saying no is not the worst thing that can happen. I worry that if I approach and ask her out, I never know if she might take it negatively, that my approach would not be appriciated and I would be labeled as a creep, it be taken as harassment, get publicly shamed, or my reputation ruined just from an innocent and respectful approach. It is a double edged sword because I am missing out on so many opportunities and I will probably be forever alone if I don't approach anyone I'm interested in. 

I wish it wasn't this way, I wish I could just approach a women with respect, be able to shoot my shot and get my answer but it feels too risky nowadays. Honestly, getting rejected is the least of my worries. 

This is why dating sucks so much right now. We forgot how to be human and we can't approach someone and respectfully express interest without potentially being viewed as a predator. 

So now the only safe avenue is OLD which is an absolute dumpster fire and almost useless to most men and women for different reasons. Sure you can get lucky sometimes but it's almost like winning the lottery, the odds are greatly against you. It's completely exploitative, it takes the human part out of it and it's turned people into products like people look for on Amazon. 

Some people use it without any intention of meeting people, they use it just as another past time like scrolling on social media or use it to get validation. No wonder everyone is so damn lonely and miserable right now. Yes men should be called out for shitty behavior but we have to create a culture that makes it safe for men to respectfully approach a woman and express interest without potentially being labeled as a creep or a predator.

1qb2vq6,https://i.redd.it/ask3eazxoycg1.jpeg,Mistakes you will do in last one week (that will cost you your rank),"Guys JEE is 7 days away and you're probably messing it up rn

dekho i'm gonna be real with you... these last few days? they can either save you or completely destroy months of prep. and i've seen WAY too many people (including some of my seniors) absolutely fumble in this final stretch.

so here's what NOT to do, because honestly everyone's gonna give you gyaan about what TO do but nobody talks about the stupid mistakes that'll actually kill your score.

1. trying to learn new shit

please. PLEASE. agar tumhe abhi tak rotational motion samajh nahi aaya then forget it. move on. i know it hurts but you're not gonna magically understand it in 6 days when you couldn't in 6 months.

my friend tried covering thermodynamics in the last week last year... bhai blanked out completely in the exam. like completely. 

just revise what you KNOW. go through your notes, formulas, reactions jo already aate hain. bas. that's literally it. One shots, marathon don’t watch all that bs in the end moment 

2. the sleep thing

yaar i get it, theres this whole ""grind"" culture and all but if you go into that exam hall running on 3 hrs of sleep you're cooked

i'm not saying sojao 10 ghante. but like 6-7 is necessary bhai. your brain needs rest to actually remember stuff. all nighters might make you feel productive but you're just gonna forget everything anyway

3. mock tests - either too many or zero

some people are giving 3 mocks a day (why???) and getting depressed when scores drop

some haven't touched a single mock because ""revision zyada important hai""

both are wrong lol

one mock every 2 days is enough now. and ANALYZE it properly. silly mistakes kaha ho rahe, time management kaisa hai, that matters more than the score

4. scrolling through reddit/youtube for ""last minute strategy""

bro the irony is not lost on me that you're reading this post rn but genuinely... agar tum ghanto scroll kar rahe ho looking for some magic tips you're just procrastinating 

everyone's posting different strategies and honestly its just noise at this point?? you know what works for you after all these months. trust that. Yt pe bohot log views farming krne aaenge don’t get into that trap

5. only solving what you're good at

this ones psychological... like it feels GOOD to solve questions you already know right? confidence boost and all

but that's not gonna help. find 2-3 weak areas (NOT completely new topics, but stuff where you keep making mistakes) and fix those. better returns.

6. comparing yourself to literally everyone

your friend is solving pyqs for the 4th time

some guy on reddit is getting 280 in mocks  

your cousin is apparently ""fully prepared""

none of this matters for YOUR exam. seriously don't do this to yourself rn, the anxiety will just mess you up

7. ignoring NCERT

especially chem... inorganic mein NCERT is literally free marks and people still skip it because ""coaching material hai na""

then some random ncert line comes in the exam and they're like ""ye kaha se aaya"" 🥀

just read through ncert inorganic once properly in these days,, mark anything that looks ""exam worthy"" because that's exactly what they ask

what you should actually do:

\- revise >> new topics (genuinely can't say this enough)

\- formula sheets daily, math aur physics especially  

\- analyze mocks properly, don't just look at score

\- take a walk or something,, your brain needs oxygen not just coffee

\- eat actual food not maggi 24/7

\- keep documents ready - admit card, id, pens etc... don't panic on exam day

these 7 days aren't gonna magically change everything. if you've been consistent this year, this is just polishing. if you haven't been... well these days can help you maximize what you DO know but miracles nahi hote

and thats fine?? like genuinely JEE isn't the only thing

actually on that note - if even if you don’t do well in JEE there are exams like bitsat which you can start prepping after 1st attempt. Jee is not the end. and BITS campuses are genuinely really good... placements are solid, campus life is great, and the whole atmosphere is way more chill than I thought

but yeah that's for later. abhi just focus on this last week

make them count but don't burn out completely 

you'll be fine. not because of some destiny BS but because you've put in the work... just trust your prep and execute

atb 🤝

now stop reading this and actually go revise lol",14,1768242551.0,BITSATPrep,3,1.0,False

negli ultimi mesi ho parlato con diversi consulenti (Big4, Tier 2, MBB) e qualche banker tramite coffee chat online brevi (circa 15 minuti).

Avevo notato che mandare CV o applicare su LinkedIn spesso non portava a risposta, quindi ho iniziato a puntare di più su questo tipo di conversazioni informali.

Il problema è che, avendo solo 15 minuti a disposizione, non è sempre facile capire cosa chiedere e cosa invece tralasciare. Spesso si rischia di fare domande troppo generiche o, al contrario, di voler chiedere troppe cose insieme.

Volevo quindi chiedere a chi ha già fatto esperienze simili (o a chi lavora in consulenza / IB):

• quali sono secondo voi le 2–3 domande più utili in una coffee chat così breve?  
• cosa evitereste assolutamente di chiedere?

Mi piacerebbe raccogliere un po’ di esperienze diverse, magari può essere utile anche ad altri che stanno iniziando ora.

I'm a 19-year-old girl and a complete introvert. Large groups drain me quickly, small talk feels uncomfortable and forced, and I need a good amount of time alone to recharge and feel like myself. I've learned to embrace this about who I am, but lately I've been hoping to find someone who lives in the same kind of calm, low-key world. Someone I can get to know without any rush or expectation to be constantly social or energetic.

I'm in my first year of college, keeping things simple outside of classes. I spend most of my free time reading (fantasy novels that let me escape into detailed worlds, or quieter character-driven stories), watching thoughtful movies and series that build slowly and leave room for reflection, listening to calm music like lo-fi, ambient, or soft indie while I journal random thoughts, doodle, or just sit with a cup of tea. I like taking long walks when it's peaceful outside, brewing coffee the way I prefer it, and letting hours pass while my mind wanders freely. Crowded places, loud environments, and packed schedules make me feel overwhelmed fast. Peace and solitude are where I feel most at ease.

I'm not interested in someone who wants to change that part of me or push me into a more extroverted lifestyle. What I'm looking for is another introvert who understands it naturally. Someone who is comfortable with silence that doesn't need filling, who values deep conversations over frequent shallow ones, who would enjoy simple shared moments like reading together quietly, exchanging book or music recommendations, watching something meaningful side by side, or talking about life and feelings when the moment feels right. I believe two introverts can build something really gentle, respectful, and meaningful because we both honor personal space and choose connection carefully.

I'd like to connect with guys around 18 to 23 who also identify strongly as introverted. You don't have to be extremely shy, just someone who recharges best alone, prefers thoughtful over constant interaction, and appreciates low-energy closeness more than high-stimulation plans. Distance is fine if the conversation feels genuine and worth nurturing.

If this sounds like it could match your own quiet nature, feel free to message me whenever you want. Maybe share a little about yourself, like what you enjoy doing in your own company, a book or song that's been on your mind lately, or what your ideal peaceful evening looks like. There's no pressure to reply quickly or be very talkative right away. We can start small, go as slow as we both need, and see if it feels natural. I'm just hoping to find one person who makes the quiet feel a little less lonely and a little more shared. Thank you for reading.",0,1768242350.0,IntrovertDating,3,0.25,False
