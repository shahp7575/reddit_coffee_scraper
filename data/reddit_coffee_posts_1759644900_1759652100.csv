1nyidlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nyidlp/aitah_for_going_to_my_sons_school_meeting_with/,AITAH for going to my sons school meeting with his mum after she expressed that she doesn't want my partner there,"My partner and I have lived together for a few years now and although we're not married she's pretty much my children's step-mum. I have 2 kids and she looks after them as much as I do and my eldest adores her. She's great with them and our relationship is great but my Ex is driving a huge wedge in between us to the point that my partner feels as though she's at breaking point and is considering leaving.

Their mum has made our lives extremely difficult with her narcissistic behavior and has pretty much tried to do everything she can to destroy our lives  such as threatening to take my house off me (the house is solely mine and in my name), claiming money from me, turning all school parents against me and even goes as far to weaponize the children to get to us. Our breakup was down to me due to the relationship with her severely affecting my Mental Health, feeling like a second class citizen and being controlled and manipulated by her and her mother who she still lives with. Co-parenting with her pretty much consists of ""her way or the highway"", constant insults and belittling of myself and my partner and generally just very unpleasant. I don't feel comfortable talking to her at all and being a non-conflict person and not very good at sticking up for myself makes interaction hard whilst I'm by myself.

She has expressed that she wishes to go for a coffee but I do not wish to do this as any time I call her out and her shitty behavior which involves the kids it is met with sarcasm, conflict and insults.

A recent conflict arose around my current partner and her (kids mum) due to the kids mum sending the kids back in their school clothes on the weekend. She has now gone to the school to express that she doesn't wish for my partner to be there at school meetings. A school meeting is due at the end of the month and I feel as though this will be detrimental to him as he spends a lot of time with my partner and she cares for him and interacts with him as much as I do.

My partner is extremely insecure due to issues in her past relationship where her Ex cheated on her with his kids mother. This has unfortunately seeped into our current relationship and she constantly thinks that I'm up to something with her and that something will happen down the line. I'm pretty much a recluse and don't even go out to work.

The meeting is important and I've told the school that I cant attend due to an appointment. The reality is is that my partner has an appointment and she wishes to be there and doesn't feel comfortable with me being with her. I don't either as I feel as though I'll be manipulated and controlled due to not being able to ""say my piece"" and likely be cornered by her after the meeting.

My partner has said that if I do go that will be the end of us as it's the principle of my Ex expressing she doesn't want her to be there and that's exactly what she'd getting.

.I really don't know what to do and feel as though I'm fighting a loosing battle.

AITAH ?

TL;DR - Son's mum doesn't want my partner  (who's like my kids step-mom)at a school meeting. My partner has said that if I go that'll be the end of us",1,1759651385.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

I’m exploring an idea, a lightweight tool to help small cafés go digital *without* the cost of having custom mobile apps.

The concept is simple:

* Customers scan a QR code to see the menu and collect digital loyalty points.
* Owners get a small dashboard to manage menu items, rewards, and see what customers love most.

I’m not trying to replace big POS systems, just give small cafés an easy way to keep customers coming back without running complex software.

It would be a mobile app that clients install, where they can see all local coffee shops, and can see their loyalty points. Each coffee shop would need to subscribe to the service to be visible in the app.

Before I go too deep building this, I’d love to get some honest feedback:

* Would a tool like this be genuinely useful, or meh just another app to ignore?
* What features would actually make it worth trying?
* Are there pain points (loyalty tracking, customer engagement, digital menus, etc.) that really annoy you today?

- Biological female 
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No human kids 
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size.
- Pleasing to the eyes 

I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). During my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from a bookstore.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and going around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I also enjoy for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely! 💯 

Currently, I’m on a mission to shed some pounds —starting with daily brisk w@lks during sunset, which has been refreshing but feels like I’m being chased by regrets (or carbs 😂). I’m considering joining a gym soon, but I believe in taking it one step at a time. I hear having a cute fitness buddy boosts motivation... so, you in? 😉 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my fun and talkative side 😂

What I’m looking for… A SINGLE guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, respectful, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, 27-35 years old, someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:,
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a CENOMAR cert when we meet 😂)
- No human kids

I’m writing a book about how I bootstrapped my company, WP Umbrella (a B2B SaaS for WordPress agencies offering websites care), from 0 to $1.2M ARR in just 3 years.

The book isn’t about billion-dollar unicorns. It’s about the messy, very real journey of building a “small but mighty” SaaS:

* How I went from corporate life to going full pirate after covid-19.
* The business pact I made with my very different co-founder.
* Why we decided against raising money.
* The tough calls (like when to hire… and when not to).
* The lessons learned (and mistakes made) along the way.

I’ve always loved books like ***The One Thing*** and ***The Hard Thing About Hard Things***, but I struggled to relate cause the authors play in a much higher league. Most of us won’t run a $10B company, but plenty of us will fight tooth and nail to build something that makes a few hundred thousand or a few million a year. That’s the story I want to document.

**Could you guys take a look at my App Store page and critique my ASO?** I'm really striving to make it as good as I possibly can. Now, the biggest competitor is HiCoffee, where I think my app is better in some critical regards (and worse in some as well) - not sure if to reflect that somehow on my app store page.

**Some highlights of the app's features:**

* **Accurate caffeine algorithm** — able to take the absorption rate and a “sipping” duration into account to actually give you a realistic estimate
* **Fully offline** — the data is only on your phone. No login, nothing. You can move the data from phone to phone
* **Comprehensive onboarding**, which (at least I hope) asks relevant questions supported by studies — those will set your caffeine half-life and sleep-safe threshold
* **Over 200 drinks in the database** — or create your own as well
* **Analytics** — including average caffeine consumption, a streak of days where your caffeine amount was good at your bedtime, drinks breakdown, etc.
* **Localized** into five languages (some of them AI-translated; please help me if you find something weird)
* **Free**. It is supported by ads, and there is an option to support the app and remove them.

My cat is on a specialized diet but not on medication and goes to his regular vet visits. 

I might be over thinking it but my biggest concern is that with his renal condition he tends to have a lot of diarrhea and occasionally gets it on his paws and tracks it indoors. 

My husband does multiple smell tests on his paws daily and cleans them whenever they smell funky which is almost daily. He also scoops his litter box at least twice a day and does a full cleaning once a week. We also frequently spot clean the floors. 

Should I be worried about him accidentally tracking feces in the house and potentially getting the newborn sick? He’s already not allowed in bedrooms but there is the potential for cross contamination in the living areas. 

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? What advice do you guys have? Thank you in advance. Also added a photo to pay the cat tax. 

(Just want to add that he’s on the coffee table because that’s where we feed him. He’s not allowed on any other table or counters, which he knows and we have indoor security cameras in the kitchen, dining room, and living room to keep an eye on the pets when we’re out of the house. We allow that one table because we also have a small dog who would love to eat the kitty’s food and this was the best solution we had to keep his food safe)

The investors didn’t notice. I did, later, when the model sent a follow-up with better grammar than any of us.

We are living in a small, absurd apocalypse. State-of-the-art voice synthesis has stopped sounding synthetic. It flattens inflection, copies cadence, and slips charm into the gaps where empathy used to be. For founders and indie hackers this reads like both opportunity and threat: imagine 24/7 customer support that never blinks, podcasts with host-duplicates, automated outreach that actually converts. Now imagine fraud that’s indistinguishable from the real founder, or bad actors issuing believable statements in your voice while you sleep.

This isn’t hypothetical theatre — it’s happening. The technical wins (prosody modeling, neural vocoders, massive fine-tuning datasets) are real, and so are the blind spots. Detection tech still plays whack-a-mole: models adapt, watermarks get blurred by post-processing, and “provenance” chains are only as strong as the weakest API key.

So what do you, a founder/consultant/solo dev with a healthy distrust of hype, do this week? Start with basics: record a short, multi-factor confirmation for sensitive calls; add voice-fingerprint checks to any investor or user verification flows; treat unsolicited audio requests like suspicious PDFs. Be paranoid about endpoints and logging — if a partner can trigger a voice stream, they can trigger misinformation.

Longer-term, pressure matters. Demand provenance: signed metadata that survives transcoding. Support open detection benchmarks, and push platforms to rate-limit new synthetic audio endpoints by default. Policy will follow when enough money burns, but norms start with us: don’t normalize “soundalikes” as a cheap substitute for consent.

If you build with audio, build with auditable signals. If you pitch with it, disclose it. If you hear your own voice in a tweet, don’t be flattered — be furious and trace the logs.

Google Trends doesn't show exact search volumes. Instead, it normalizes data on a scale of **0 to 100**, showing you relative popularity.

* **100** = the peak interest for the selected time and region.
* **50** = half as popular as the peak.
* **0** = too little data to register.

This matters because you're not just looking at numbers -- you're looking at **momentum.** A niche that steadily climbs over months is far more valuable than one that spikes for a week and vanishes.

**Compare Multiple Search Terms**

Don't just check one keyword. Stalk two or three related terms and see how they perform against each other. Example:

* ""Sustainable skincare"" vs. ""vegan skincare"" vs. ""natural skincare""
* You might find that one is rising steadily while another is plateauing.

This helps you identify not just a niche, but the language your target audience actually uses.

**Spot Seasonal and Regional Trends**

Niches often depend on **when** and **where** interest spikes.

* **Seasonal example:** ""Camping gear"" rises every summer, while ""Christmas decor"" on the 4th quarter of the year.
* **Regional example:** ""Matcha"" may trend higher in the U.S. West Coast than in other regions.

This kind of insight helps you decide when to launch products, when to ramp up marketing, and which markets to focus on.

**Use ""Related Topics"" and ""Related Queries""**

This is where real niche gold is buries.

* **Related topics** show what people are searching for alongside your keyword.
* **Related queries** often reveal **rising searches** that haven't peaked yet.

For instance, looking up ""remote work tools"" might surface related rising queries like ""async communication"" or ""coworking memberships"" -- clues about emerging micro-niches.

**Watch for ""Breakout"" Searches**

In Google Trends, some keywords show ""Breakout"" instead of a percentage.

This means searches grew by more than **5000%**. Breakout terms can indicate:

* **A fad** that will crash as quickly as it spiked.
* **A new niche** that hasn't saturated yet.

The challenge is separating noise from signal. Pair Google Trends with other date sources (Reddit discussions, Keyword tools, Twitter chatter) to validate.

**Turn Insights Into Action**

Here's how you can actually apply this:

* **Content creators:** Build blog posts and videos around rising queries before competitors.
* **E-commerce entrepreneurs:** Stock or dropship products tied to breakout searches in your category.
* **Marketers:** Craft campaigns that align with seasonal spikes for maximum impact.

**Final Thoughts**

Google Trends is more than a curiosity tool -- it's an **early-warning system** for where attention is moving online. Bold entrepreneurs and marketers don't just follow trends; they anticipate them. If you treat Trends as a living map of consumer curiosity, you'll spot opportunities long before they hit the mainstream.

**The real question isn't whether your niche exists. It's whether you're seeing it early enough to lead instead to follow.**",1,1759650139.0,OnlineIncomeHustle,1,1.0,False

Now for some people it can be, but that is very rarely the root problem. The same how eczema can be genetic but is usually caused by goyslop refined oils. Then to cope and forget they cover it with makeup which will make it worse because makeup is toxic and your pores are clogged too. When you consume alcohol or drugs and a lot of medication it causes stress on the body, even if its not the stress you feel. This stress is what causes racoon eyes. Eating a diet high in goyslop will add to the problem, especially if you're high carb. Foods high in pesticides are toxic and will stress the body too. I know people who sleep 10+ hours a day and still have awful racoon eyes. If you want to get rid of racoon you need to stop using all drugs and alcohol, switch to a diet that is lower in carbs/sugar and no pesticides. I won't say to stop taking medications but if you can you should, especially any medication that raises heart rate. This obviously includes coffee.

1nyhxk1,https://i.redd.it/rqozl29zx8tf1.jpeg,NAGs Friday Steam Wishlist Sale,"Ah, Friday. That magical day where time slows to a crawl, your email inbox decides to go full Final Boss Mode, and every meeting feels like it was scheduled by someone who thinks “fun” is a war crime.

But we made it. We survived. And to celebrate, Cody and I are back with another round of “let’s see how fast we can drain your Steam wallet.”

Now, I should clarify: when I say we, I mean me.

Cody’s picks are technically on the list, but let’s be real, if gaming taste was a stat, his would still be stuck in the tutorial.

Mine, however? Glorious. Flawless. The stuff wishlists are truly made of.

But hey, if you’re new here, welcome to the weekly tradition where I try (and fail) to stop Cody from making questionable life choices in game form.

So let’s not waste another second. Fire up that wishlist, kiss your savings goodbye, and let’s dive in.



**ENA: Dream BBQ**  
**Price:** *Free*  
[**Get It Here** ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2134320/ENA_Dream_BBQ/)

**Why It’s On Arielle’s Wishlist:**

If there’s one thing I know about Cody, it’s that he’s going to try to flex with some big-name, heavy-hitter picks today.

But you know what flexes harder than all of that? A game that’s not just Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam, but also completely free.

Yes, free, as in it costs zero money.

So, unless you hate fun and bargains, what exactly are you waiting for?

**What Is ENA: Dream BBQ:**

ENA: Dream BBQ is the first interactive adventure in the surreal and beloved ENA series by Joel G.

You play as ENA, a perpetually unlucky daydreamer searching for a mysterious Boss that everyone seems desperate to find.

Along the way, you’ll explore bizarre worlds, take on odd jobs, and interact with characters who range from sweet to “please stop talking to me.”

Armed with strange tools and a knack for stumbling into trouble, ENA navigates puzzles, predicaments, and the crushing reality of being the least popular person at any party.



**Terraria**  
**Price:** *R135 marked down from R270, for 4x Copies*  
[**Get It Here**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/)

**Why It’s On Cody’s Wishlist:**

Once, someone made me coffee.

Then, they proceeded to complain about my choice of favourite game, so I added their favourite game to my wishlist.

That game was Terraria.

**What Is Terraria:**

Terraria is a sandbox action-style platformer game where you must use your creativity to survive.

Explore, build, and fight your way through a randomly generated world, all while basking in the gloriously crafted pixel art style.



**Grimshire**  
**Price:** *R130 marked down from R145*  
[**Get It Here** ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2238470/Grimshire/)

**Why It’s on Arielle’s Wishlist:**

Because nothing screams me quite like a game that says: “Here’s your cosy farmhouse, here’s your plague, good luck not dying.”

Honestly, it’s the farming sim of my dreams, or nightmares, depending on how much you enjoy watching your villagers slowly wither away while you’re trying to pickle turnips.

Also, I have my partner to thank for this one. They dangled the demo in front of me like a shiny lure, and I lost more hours to it than I’d ever admit in polite company.

Stardew Valley but with pestilence and questionable survival odds? Yeah, that’s going straight from wishlist to library the second I get the chance.

**What Is Grimshire:**

Grimshire is a farming sim with a dark survival twist.

After barely escaping the destruction of your hometown, you’re welcomed into a secluded mountain village.

Here, you’ll restore a farmhouse, plant crops, tame animals, and forage in the wild, all while preparing for the inevitable arrival of a devastating plague.

It’s part cosy sim, part survival horror and part “emotional damage” waiting to happen.

Basically, if Stardew Valley and The Last of Us had a gloomy but oddly adorable child, it would be Grimshire.



**Code Vein**  
**Price:** *R69 marked down from R699*  
[**Get It Here**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/678960/CODE_VEIN/)

**Why It’s On Cody’s Wishlist:**

I’m always down for a third-person action RPG, with a bit of character customisation, a slick storyline, and an anime-esque art style.

I mean, what’s not to love?

Anime? Nobody hates anime, right?

**What Is Code Vein:**

Code Vein is a souls-like RPG where players attempt to restore balance to a post-apocalyptic world, where vampire-like beings roam.

Without blood to keep them from losing their minds, many of these beings have become lost to their vampiric selves.

Explore the world of Code Vein and unravel plot-twisting secrets as you attempt to save as many as you can.



**Finding Paradise**  
**Price:** *R25 marked down from R100*  
[**Get It Here** ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/337340/Finding_Paradise/)

**Why It’s on Arielle’s Wishlist:**

Because I like my games the way I like my Friday nights: pixelated, emotionally devastating, and leaving me staring at the ceiling, wondering where it all went wrong.

Also, it’s by the same devs who gave us To the Moon, which basically invented the “make grown adults ugly-cry over 16-bit sprites” genre.

And yes, it’s Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam, just saying.

**What Is Finding Paradise:**

Finding Paradise is the second full entry in the To the Moon series from Freebird Games.

You play as Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts, two doctors with the unique (and slightly invasive) job of granting patients one final wish before they pass, by rewriting their memories from the very start of their lives.

This time, their patient is Colin, whose life is split right down the middle.

The catch? His final wish is contradictory, forcing the doctors (and you) to navigate a puzzle of memories, regrets, and choices to piece together what he truly wants before his last breath.

Think of it as science, philosophy, and heartbreak all wrapped up in a pixel-art RPG.

If To the Moon broke you in the best possible way, Finding Paradise is here to finish the job.



**Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition**  
**Price**: *R115 marked down from R329*  
[**Get It Here**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466860/Age_of_Empires_IV_Anniversary_Edition/)

**Why It’s On Cody’s Wishlist:** 

Can’t call yourself an OG gamer if you never dove into the world of Age of Empires.

It’s within my gamer core to want to try out every new Age of Empire release in the hunt for some of that wololo.

**What Is Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition:**

Age of Empires IV is the fourth in a hugely successful real-time strategy series.

Work your way through the different eras of the world, playing as famous, or infamous, civilisations.

Re-live historic battles through time, or face off against your frienemies in multiplayer RTS combat.



And there you have it, another Friday wishlist roundup hotter than a GPU trying to run Starfield on max settings.

Cody will tell you his games are “essential,” I’ll tell you mine are “art,” and you’ll tell your bank account “I’m so, so sorry.”

See you next week for another episode of A Tale of Two Wishlists: The Good, The Bad, and Cody’s Picks.

My ex and I had just finished brunch, and he kept brushing his hand against mine while we walked. It wasn’t accidental; I could feel he wanted to hold it.

And honestly, I wanted to, too. But something in me froze.

It wasn’t fear of him —he made me feel safe— it was that stupid little voice in the back of my head saying, “What if someone stares? What if someone says something?”

He noticed. He always noticed.
“You don’t wanna hold my hand?” he asked, half joking, half hurt.

I smiled awkwardly. “It’s not that, I just— I don’t know, there’s a lot of people around.”
He looked down, nodded slowly, and said, “Yeah… I get it.”

So we kept walking, side by side, coffee cups as shields. I felt like an idiot. Because I knew that moment mattered —not for him to show off, but to just exist, to be normal.

Later that day, before we said goodbye, I reached for his hand myself. I didn’t say anything, just held it for a few seconds while we stood waiting for his Uber.

And he smiled. That kind of small, quiet smile that tells you, “It’s okay. Maybe next time you’ll be braver.”",1,1759649502.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

I want my own family in the future very much so I know what I want in life,"
Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

I've made previous attempts, but it didn't really work out. So now I'm hoping to meet someone I can spend time with and maybe share some good convos and simple adventures. Who knows, a single date might open doors for eternity.

I'm introverted by nature but can carry a conversation when there's a genuine connection. I'm a CPA working in Manila. I'd like to believe I'm kind and generally a nice person. I'm financially stable, single, and usually flies solo, but lately l've been wanting more social interaction. Would love to hang out with someone who's into cafe/resto hopping (not really for the coffee but for the ambiance), watching movies, checking out new places, or just doing random fun stuff when time allows.

I usually prefer chatting first, but I'm hoping to meet someone who's in the search for something lasting and not just to pass time. Being a Big 4 grad would be a plus, but at the very least, l'd love to meet someone sensible and engaging to talk to. And someone who has aspirations in life and can inspire me to be a better person.

Heads up though! I am a bit on the heavy side, but have been actively working on it since early this year. So far, malayo na but still a bit more to work on!

The quarterly reports spread across my mahogany desk like fallen autumn leaves, each page representing millions in revenue that should have filled me with satisfaction. Instead, I found myself staring at the numbers without really seeing them, my Mont Blanc pen hovering over profit margins that suddenly felt meaningless.



The phone's shrill ring cut through the afternoon silence of my corner office. I glanced at the caller ID—Riverside Pharmacy—and frowned. We didn't use that pharmacy. David and I had our prescriptions filled at the upscale clinic near our penthouse.



""Leah Cox speaking.""



""Ms. Cox, this is Rosa Rodriguez from Riverside Pharmacy."" The woman's voice carried a note of irritation that immediately put me on edge. ""I'm calling about an outstanding balance on your husband's account. David Pierce?""



My grip tightened on the phone. ""I'm sorry, there must be some mistake. We don't—""



""Ma'am, the balance is eight hundred forty-seven dollars and fifty cents for birth control prescriptions over the past four months. The insurance claim was denied, and we need payment immediately.""



The words hit me like ice water. Birth control pills. My hand began to tremble, and I set down my pen before it could slip from my fingers. ""Could you repeat that?""



""Birth control pills, ma'am. Multiple refills under Mr. Pierce's insurance. The account shows—""



""That's impossible."" My voice came out sharper than intended. ""My husband doesn't need birth control pills.""



A pause. ""Well, ma'am, someone's been picking them up regularly. Same prescription, same name. If there's a dispute—""



""No."" I closed my eyes, my mind racing. ""No dispute. I'll... I'll handle this.""



I ended the call and stared at the phone as if it had betrayed me. Eight hundred forty-seven dollars. Four months. Multiple refills. The numbers burned themselves into my consciousness with the same precision I used to memorize financial projections.



Why would David need birth control pills? We'd been trying to conceive for over a year. Just last week, he'd held me after another negative pregnancy test, whispering promises about trying harder, being patient. His hands had been so gentle, his voice so reassuring.



The afternoon sun slanted through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting long shadows across my office. Everything looked the same—the awards lining my bookshelf, the fresh orchids Victoria had arranged this morning, the city sprawling below like a kingdom I'd conquered. But something fundamental had shifted, like a fault line cracking beneath the foundation of my world.



I tried to focus on the reports, but the numbers blurred together. Every calculation felt pointless when weighed against the growing dread in my chest. There had to be an explanation. David would have one. He always did.



By six o'clock, I'd accomplished nothing. The drive home passed in a haze of traffic lights and half-formed theories, each one more unsettling than the last. Our penthouse felt different when I stepped inside—too quiet, too pristine, like a museum of a life I thought I knew.



The sound of chopping drew me to the kitchen. David stood at the marble island, his back to me, methodically dicing vegetables with the precision of someone who'd learned to cook from YouTube videos. His dark hair was slightly mussed, his shirt sleeves rolled up in that casual way that used to make my heart skip.



""How was your day?"" he asked without turning around, his voice carrying its usual warmth.



I watched him work, noting the steady rhythm of the knife, the confident way he moved around our kitchen. This was David—my David—who'd learned to cook because I worked late, who'd surprised me with homemade pasta on our anniversary.



""Interesting."" I kept my tone neutral, businesslike. ""I got a call from Riverside Pharmacy today.""



The chopping stopped for just a fraction of a second before resuming its steady rhythm. ""Oh?""



""About birth control pills. Under your insurance.""



His shoulders tensed almost imperceptibly. ""Right. Those are for Kalani. She's been having trouble with her insurance, you know how it is. I told her I'd help out.""



The explanation came too quickly, too smoothly. In boardrooms, I'd learned to recognize the subtle tells of a prepared lie—the slight pause before speaking, the overly casual tone, the way someone's hands might betray their nerves even when their voice remained steady.



David's hands were shaking.



""Eight hundred dollars worth?"" I stepped closer, studying his profile. ""Over four months?""



""You know how expensive medication is without proper coverage."" He still hadn't looked at me, his attention fixed on the vegetables as if they required surgical precision. ""I should have mentioned it, but I didn't want to worry you with Kalani's problems.""



Every instinct I'd honed through years of negotiations screamed that he was lying. The David I married would have turned around by now, would have met my eyes with that open, honest gaze that had first captured my heart in a crowded coffee shop.



This David kept his back turned, kept chopping, kept lying.



""Of course,"" I said quietly. ""How thoughtful of you to help your sister.""



The knife paused again, and I saw his reflection in the stainless steel refrigerator—the tight line of his mouth, the way his eyes darted away from even his own reflection.



That night, I lay awake staring at the ceiling while David slept peacefully beside me, his breathing deep and even. The man who'd held me through countless nights, who'd promised me forever, who'd sworn we were trying to build a family together.



The same man who was buying birth control pills in secret.

1nyhobo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/comments/1nyhobo/am_i_a_dck/,Am I a d*ck?,"I'd been with this guy for almost 7 months, and for the first while, everything was great. We had a few light arguments here and there but nothing we couldn't come back from. However, one common thing on his end seems to be lack of communication. I'm in my early 30s (F), and he's in his late 20s and lives with his family. He and his sibling share the household expenses. His parents don't work and are in their late 50s and early 60s (one of them has specifically told him they're unmotivated to work. I'm not sure about the other one). Ultimately when it comes to a partner, I want to get married and live with him full time. I'm not saying I want this all tomorrow, and I do want to marry the right person for me. He knows all this, and he says he wants the same things, but it seems to me sometimes like he's comfortable with me being lenient. He does do things for me here and there, and I appreciate it, but up until recently, I did the majority of the driving (we live in separate towns),  and I would take him out to lunch or dinner 9 times out of 10. I've expressed to him that I would love for him to surprise me with a coffee sometime or flowers, and he has gotten us coffee once because I went to the hospital for pelvic pain (he asked if he could do anything for me, and I asked for the coffee and for him to be there with me). He was there for that. He also met up with me to get a car (I took out a loan because I was in need of a reliable car). At that time, I had nowhere to go, and his family was kind enough to let me stay with them for a few months. He and I weren't together originally; we started dating after I moved in. It wasn't originally my intention, but I saw that he'd been there for me. I soon got multiple jobs and saved up some money to get my own place. Then I went down to one job and started working less to enjoy my apartment, myself, and to have more time reserved for him. At some point after I moved out, he started going hours at a time, or half a day, or almost a whole day without messaging me, and I would tell him how I felt about it enough times to where the most recent time when I didn't say much in response to one of his messages (sometimes I honestly would feel not as talkative), he automatically told me he was sorry if he was getting bad with the texting again. I've told him probably almost a dozen times that I understand if he's having quality time with a family member or having alone time. I've also told him that I'm understanding that we likely won't hear for each other much, if at all, when at work (we have different work schedules), but I feel like he could put in more effort when he's home. I feel like if he wanted to talk more, he'd find a way without exhausting himself. He does come over to my place every once in a while on a Thursday night (Thursdays and Fridays are his days off), and we do get to wake up to each other and spend Friday together (I am off Fridays and Saturdays). Usually he comes over Friday night a few hours before he has to go to sleep for work (he starts work in the early morning before the sun starts rising), and up until the past two weekends, I was driving him to and from work. I do live close to his work. Also before these last two weekends, I'd drive him to and from my place (he does have a car and drives to and from work when he's home). I figured that we'd compromise with the driving as well as him coming over every other Thursday or one Thursday a month, but we didn't talk about it further. I wasn't hanging out with him at his family's home, either, so I get a ding for that. I should have done that for him. I understand that all of this is a huge adjustment for us both, but I feel like he could never make a solid decision about us being in a commitment in the future because he felt responsible for his family. Again, I don't mean we have to get married and live together tomorrow, but after a few years, I'd expect it. I feel like I've been fairly understanding, thought I don't have my own family, so maybe I'm not understanding enough. I've told him after marriage and moving in together, either he could visit family, or we could both visit family. Even if it's for half a day or even a whole day perhaps once a week or something. I did figure that if he went by himself, I'd go get my nails done or have a spa or girls day. 

I feel that I'd been clear in what I wanted, and I wasn't seeing any improvements in the communication, so I broke up with him. Now I'm questioning myself more. Do I expect too much? Am I unreasonable? Did I make the biggest mistake of my life by refusing to wait longer, or does this all imply that things wouldn't have changed? I feel, for the most part, I've done right by myself, but there is that lingering panic that I could have been too impulsive. He never brought up anything that was wrong between us, so if anything was on his mind about it, I wouldn't know. Thinking about it more now, and rereading, I do think that I could have been more compromising with the driving situation, as he shouldn't be the only one doing the driving to and from this town, and I do feel saddened by the thought that I could've spent the time to go to his home and hangout.

I know 7 months is not that long. We had started calling each other husband and wife too soon, and we had gone on a trip months ago where  I bought a ring for myself and told him a month or two after that it was important to me because I considered it my engagement ring. We also told each other those three words too fast,and said we were meant to be I don't open up to people often, but he knows just about everything about me. I told him from the start that  I have HPV and precervical cancer and that I don't see myself having children for these reasons as well as others, such as the economy, struggles with body image, age, and mental health reasons, and a drive to travel the world. He said early on that he was OK with not having children as long as he had me, and he agreed that he wouldn't want to bring children into this economy either. I told him he needed to be sure because wanting children in a relationship is a big deal. I did sometimes have dreams of babies, and I would tell him because I would have pregnancy scares. He never wanted to wear a condom, and he didn't like pulling out, so not only did I give him HPV, but I would either be buying Plan B constantly, or I'd get the Opills at Walmart that are basically birth control without a prescription. I made him aware early on that the liklihood of him getting HPV while having unprotected sex is high, and he didn't seem to mind. Even when he got it, he said, ""I guess we're really married now."" I also talked to him several times about the expense of all the pills and how they can increase my chances of having active precervical cancer again, or worse (I've had three proceedures in the past that he knows about). Eventually I gave up which I shouldn't have done. 

When I broke it off with him, I said, ""What if we were having a baby, and my water broke, and I went into active labor. If you weren't around me, and I can't get through to you, would the excuse be you're bad at communicating?"" He would sometimes say that he's bad at texting or bad at communicating. I'd been telling him for the past week that I've been stressed. I feel like he wasn't there for me during this time. Not that he has to be at my side every minute, but I honestly feel like I lost trust in him. It reminds me that I can handle things on my own. I even told him not too long ago that he was my best friend. He had been starting to play around with me a bit, making funny faces at me and pretending to ninja kick me and all. Of course, I was a teensy bit smashed (he was sober- and no, I don't do this often anymore- there was once a time), and I don't really have friends, but I meant what I said and truly believe that partners should be best friends, anyway. Then, of course he pulls away again. It all seems too convenient. 

I told him I need someone who's ready to get serious.

I tried not to, but I did hear parts of what she was saying (she was quite loud and im not sure why she wanted to have a therapy session in a public place). She seemed extremely distressed and anxious. Father died early, 5-year relationship ended because ex wasn't taking care of her when she was having panic attacks, current guy she was saying was an avoidant and wouldn't text her for days, financial condition wasn't the best either and she was on medication. I even saw her cry during the therapy session. 

I did think maybe I could just ask her if she was alright, or was having a long day...but the fear of being intrusive just stopped me.

I could relate to a lot of what she was saying. Moving to, and living in, delhi isn't easy. Anxiety is in the air. As someone who has an anxious attachment style and has been in love with an avoidant, I know, for a fact, that it is absolute hell to not receive a text back for hours (if not days).

5. Could not take any breaks because of lack of staffing
6. When these issues were brought up to management they responded by ignoring our messege and telling us to stop communicating with each other.
7. Management also lowered my hours significantly after these issues were brought up which is a form of retaliation firing and symptoms of a toxic work environment.
8. Treated in a discriminatory manner by owners and assistant manager by gossiping and ostracizing me and my fellow poc workers.
9. Violated the Geneva convention probably.

The owners of volt are money hungry parasites that are willing to violate their workers rights just to pinch a penny. The management of volt is a spineless bullies that treat their workers like incompetent children.

For all these reasons I have quit and I’m making this post to inform everyone to the kind of business they are supporting

1nyhhft,https://www.reddit.com/r/becomingsecure/comments/1nyhhft/how_to_ask_friends_directly_for_reciprocating/,How to ask friends directly for reciprocating things,"Before I jump into this I want to give more context- last year I went through a breakup, I felt rejected and since then I've become sensitive to rejection. I feel sensitive to rejections which come in small ways in everyday life and I think I end up avoiding doing things where I fear I might get rejected. 

My birthday this year was on a week day so I feared my friends wouldn't be able to come over cause they have work. I didn't invite them at the same time I assumed that they would celebrate it on the weekend because we meet every weekend. We've been meeting every weekend for the past 2 years now.

I had already excitedly told them that I wanted yarn for my birthday!!!!

On my birthday every one messaged me on the group chat. My friend told me he had ordered yarn, he sent me the screenshot of the order. I felt happy!

But that was it, the yarn got delivered 1 week later and when I met them on the weekend they forgot to wish me, only when I was leaving one friend remembered and wished me and then others wished me.

I was expecting a birthday cake, because up until coming year we cut the cake on everyone's birthday and celebrated it before or after their birthday.

But that was it.

I am grately for the yarn. I told them I loved the yarn and thank them.

I feel I'm sounding entitled sometimes, that I should be grateful that I got yarn for my birthday.

There are 8 people in my friend group. I'm aware that sometimes I feel when I want reciprocity  I feel I am being transactional. Because I feel that on my friend's birthday I crochet her a flower and gave a handwritten letter, for another friend I crochet a brooch which he said he'd like(not for his birthday per se but I remembered), one friend likes coffee and journals, so I gifted her my favourite brand's journal notebook which has cover picture of coffee beans and coffee machine. I gifted a journal to another friend who said once she wanted to buy a journal. I crocheted a earing for another friend.

I feel in the moment I might be subconsciously and conciously expecting  birthday present back from my friends when I'm giving them their birthday present apart from the dopmine I get when I give gifts to my friends. But when some of my friend didn't even gift me anything it really hurt. It hurt so much. Sometimes I feel birthday are the saddest day of the year because you have expectations from close people in your life and then you feel let down because when you're giving  birthday presents to them you're expecting something similar back from your friends on your birthday which is a receipe of unhappiness.

In retrospect I feel that I should have invited them on my birthday even though I'm aware they might not show up. I did invited one of the friend she said she'd show up but she didn't :( another reason I assume they wouldn't show up because it take 1 hour drive to reach my place

How to securely approach this situation in the present moment? How to securely convey that I felt hurt when my friends didn't call me on my birthday or almost forgot to wish me, I felt hurt because there was no birthday cake? I want to convey my feeling without them getting defensive or overwhelmed.

How to handle this situation in the future? 


I saw a Instagram reel around my birthday which stuck with me. I saw that on her birthday she would write a letter to herself in the future on her birthday wishing herself a happy birthday. She went on a 4 hour hike and then in the evening she went out for a dinner with her partner. There were no feelings of expectations, disappointment, hurt, conflict, sadness on her birthday. 

I did wrote a letter to my future self which I would open on my birthday next year! It felt amazing to write the letter. 

English is not my first or second language, please excuse my grammar.

Day 108 of my Niche fragrance journey, and this little number followed me home this week. Meet Vespri Aromatico, An citrus forward freshy following in the style of more traditional Italian perfumer traditions. The oils in this fragrance are extracted through inefficient means like steeping... But the fragrance that comes out the other side of that long... LONG process is nothing short of utterly refreshing.

  
Guys, I'm serious, when i smelled this on paper, I cannot fully put to words how ""realistic"" this smells. Right off the top, you are hit with this massive punch of pure lemon zest. Strong and punchy! Shockingly bright! And that's followed up by some herbs and sweet florals, middling out after maybe 20 minutes into mostly lemon and gentle floral notes plus some white amber to sweeting the whole package, and then about an hour in at full dry down, this fragrance becomes this sweet, creamy confection of lemons. herbs, and sandalwood. GOD is the lemon kicking in this. Its weird because as i smell it on the drydown, i ALMOST get the smell of Limoncello. Not quite, but that sort of dessert-ish vibe is here. But Primarily this is just fresh. Like... I bathed in the most luxurious soups imaginable and am now here in a linen suit to dance the day away with you levels of fresh. 

Its... gorgeous. Jaw-droppingly gorgeous. The notes never do these fragrances justice. I'm telling you now this is the single best lemon fragrance I've ever smelled. THIS is what i wanted when i said ""freshie"". THIS right here! A herbal and SLIGHTLY woody citrus B O M B! Make me feel like life has given me all of the lemons. Every single one, and I'm drowning in them. Unbelievable stunning 10/10 no notes. This house is officially on my radar. I've heard one or two good things about Nobile 1942, but this one was a curve ball. I want to see how some of their darker fragrance profiles perform, because if THIS is how they do bright fresh summery feelings? I can only imagine their moodier pieces are going to put me in a fall sweater with a coffee in hand and I'm not even gonna know what happened.

  
If you haven't smelled it and are interested, Scentsplit carries samples, and full bottles are available through gray market sites as well as direct from manufacturer. I got my bottle at a store near me, but for those without access to such bougie things a 1 mil sampler from a decant site will get the point across. And while your at it, Try Vespri Esperidati from Nobile too. I didnt commit to that bottle, but I had to grit my teeth chosing between the two bottles. Closer to a more ""traditional"" fougere profile, but twists in with these unmistakably Italian notes (and lemon) that make it really stand out to me. Give them a shot PLEASE! I don't know if this house is small or not, but if it is it sure as SHIT doesn't deserve to be.",4,1759647784.0,Colognes,1,1.0,False

1nyhd1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1nyhd1j/paul_doiron_books_in_order/,Paul Doiron Books In Order,"Hey everyone!

I just finished *The Poacher's Son* by Paul Doiron, and I'm genuinely excited to share my thoughts, almost like I'm chatting with a friend over coffee. If you're looking to dive into a truly gripping mystery series, this one is an excellent place to start. For those wondering about the full reading order of this fantastic author, you can always check out the helpful [Paul Doiron Books In Order](https://pdfhive.com/paul-doiron-books-in-order/) guide. But for now, let's talk about this particular adventure!

The story introduces us to Mike Bowditch, a Maine game warden with a bit of a troubled past. His life gets turned upside down when his estranged father, a legendary but notoriously elusive poacher, becomes the prime suspect in a brutal murder. Mike finds himself in an impossible situation: he's torn between his duty to the law and a deep-seated, complex loyalty to his father. It's a journey into the wild, untamed Maine wilderness, both literally and figuratively, as Mike tries to unravel the truth.

What I really enjoyed about *The Poacher's Son* was how deeply you get into Mike's head. He's not your typical flawless hero; he's flawed, makes mistakes, and is constantly battling his own ethics and emotions. This made him feel incredibly real and relatable. The relationship with his father is the heart of the story, full of unspoken history and tension, which I found captivating.

Doiron's writing style is a huge highlight. He has this incredible ability to paint vivid pictures of the Maine landscape – the forests, the rivers, the changing seasons – making it feel like another character in the book. The pacing was just right for a mystery; it kept me turning pages late into the night, but also allowed space for some thoughtful reflection on family, justice, and the wild. The way he blends a classic whodunit with a strong sense of place and personal drama is truly impressive.

Would I recommend this book? Absolutely! If you enjoy thrillers, character-driven mysteries, or stories set in the great outdoors, this book is definitely for you. It's got suspense, emotional depth, and a protagonist you can really root for, even when he's making questionable decisions. It's a great choice for anyone looking for a solid mystery to get lost in.

Now, for those of you who might be new to reading mysteries, or just getting back into reading in general, I have a few friendly tips. Getting into a new series can feel a bit daunting, but it doesn't have to be!

1.  **Start at the Beginning:** Like with Paul Doiron's series, always try to start with the first book. It helps you get to know the characters and the world they inhabit properly.
2.  **Give it Some Time:** Don't feel pressured to love a book from the very first page. Sometimes it takes 50 or even 100 pages for a story to really hook you. If you're still not feeling it after that, it's okay to move on! There are thousands of amazing books out out there.
3.  **Don't Overthink It:** Especially with mysteries, don't worry about remembering every single detail or trying to solve the case perfectly as you read. Just enjoy the ride and let the author lead you through the twists and turns. The fun is in the journey, not just the destination!
4.  **Find Your Spot:** Create a cozy reading nook, grab a cup of tea, and carve out a little time each day just for reading. It helps build a habit and makes the experience more enjoyable.

Reading should be a joy, not a chore. If you're looking to find more great books or explore the full sequence of Mike Bowditch's adventures, remembering the [Paul Doiron Books In Order](https://pdfhive.com/paul-doiron-books-in-order/) guide can be super helpful.

I really think *The Poacher's Son* is a fantastic introduction to a wonderful series, and a great example of a mystery that offers both thrills and heart. Happy reading, everyone!

He's my reason for breathing. He's my heart walking around outside of my body. He's literally my miracle. Now , onto my FIRST DATE since before I did IVF to get pregnant with my son . So 5 + years ! Is this just how things are now ? 

So met what I thought was a decent guy On Bumble . Now I make my profile very clear and direct as far as about myself and what I'm looking for and not looking for . We chatted online for a few days , then video calls . Initially and especially now I feel/felt like either he was hiding something or something was off about him . 

He asked me to coffee and a beach walk . We met there , it went okay . I definitely didn't feel sparks or have any immediate attraction. In fact the more time we spent together the less attracted I became. He asked me on a 2nd date the next day for dinner . I was hesitant but I decided to give him another chance. 

We met at the restaurant . Dinner was interesting to say the least . He mentioned that I didn't really seem to be funny or have a sense of humor? ( Wow , sorry didn't know i was supposed to laugh at all your crude, immature, sexist jokes )

Meanwhile,  he kept trying to touch me , I'm not saying a simple touch. I'm talking rubbing my shoulders , caressing my cheek , rubbing his thumb on my lip ( eww) constantly holding my hand and kissing it . After I had asked him several times to please stop. He then made jokes that I was a prude or sexually repressed!

After dinner he asked to come back to my house , I firmly said no , as I told him several times , plus it's also in my profile that I won't be intimate with anyone until I'm in a LTR that's leading to marriage. My son is my number 1 priority. He acted like he understood.  

Then, while driving home , he texted me 26 tines in the 30-minute drive home !  I don't text & drive , even though my Bluetooth is connected to my car via android auto . After I got home , he called,  again and he asked me out to a full date day starting with lunch , then a museum, a walk etc followed by dinner in a nice beach front place . I agreed, and we continued to text that evening , then again the next morning, which was the day of the date . 

Needless to say, he never arrived. No call , No show.  Since I had already paid a sitter and gotten dressed up. I ordered lunch , paid my bill , left a generous tip, and went home . After I got home , I texted him again and let him know I was worried and asked if he was okay because he never showed up . He replied, ""Yeah , I'm fine ."" Maybe we can go out some other time, lol . 

He then sent 6 dozen roses to my house , each one with sexually explicit language and major love bombing. The last 3 included notes saying I Love you , the Last 1 said Marry me ? But I Refuse to raise or take care if another Mans Problem! . So would you consider putting it ( speaking about my 3 yesr old son ) up for adoption?( I had been very upfront and honest about my choice to become a SPBC/SMBC!A dozen a day for 6 days straight!

I arrived at the restaurant and went in and waited,  I texted him after 20 minutes past our agreed upon time to meet, and he said I will be there shortly. 

Needless to say, he never arrived. No text , No Call, No Show. Since I had already paid a sitter and dressed up . I ordered lunch , paid my bill , left a generous tip, and went home .

1nyh61e,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nyh61e/whats_new_in_portable_mug_warmer_designs_lately/,What's new in portable mug warmer designs lately?,"Hey everyone! I've been obsessed with finding the perfect mug warmer lately, and I thought I'd share my recent discoveries about the latest designs and features. As someone who constantly forgets about their coffee until it's cold, these gadgets have been a game-changer for me.

I've noticed that modern mug warmers have come a long way from those basic heating plates we used to see. The newest models I've found (especially this one: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) have smart temperature control systems that maintain your drink at the exact temperature you prefer. No more scorched coffee or lukewarm tea!

What really caught my attention is how portable these new designs are. Most of them are lightweight, compact, and some even come with built-in batteries. I can take mine from my desk to the living room without unplugging it. Plus, the sleek designs actually look good on my workspace – no more hiding them when guests come over.

One feature that's becoming standard is auto-shutdown protection. I used to worry about leaving my old warmer on, but these new ones automatically turn off after a few hours or when you remove your mug. Pretty neat, right?

The heating technology has improved too. Instead of just warming the bottom of your mug, many new models use advanced heating elements that distribute heat more evenly. I've found that this prevents that annoying situation where the bottom of your drink is hot while the top is cold.

If you're in the market for one, I highly recommend checking out this model: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer. It's got all the features I mentioned and more. The price point is reasonable too, considering how much use you'll get out of it.

Something else worth mentioning is the variety of compatible drinkware. Most new warmers work with different materials - ceramic, glass, metal mugs - you name it. Just make sure your mug has a flat bottom for the best heat transfer.

The LED displays on newer models are also pretty useful. They show you the exact temperature of your drink, and some even let you set your preferred temperature. No more guessing if your coffee is still hot enough to drink!

I've found these particularly useful during long work-from-home days or while binge-watching shows. It's nice not having to microwave my coffee every 30 minutes or settle for cold drinks.

Just remember to consider the size of your regular mugs when choosing a warmer. Some models are designed for standard cups, while others can accommodate larger travel mugs. Also, check if it comes with a warranty - always a good thing to have for electronic devices.

Hope this helps anyone who's been considering getting a mug warmer! Let me know if you have any questions about specific features or models.",1,1759646876.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Ordered an espresso shot and flat whites. The espresso was strong and full bodied honestly, I loved smelling it more than drinking it. The golden crema on top was the best part, like a crown on a tiny cup of royalty.

The flat whites were strong too. I think they’re just a less frothy version of a cappuccino, and because the foam is thinner, there’s room for more milk and espresso. What I got was creamy, velvety, bold, and fine. It felt like a drug. I literally smiled after the first sip.

- Cut out many of my carbs. I eat a lot of south Asian food so this was a big change, and probably contributed to most of the weight loss. 
- Upped protein like no one’s business. I was primarily vegetarian before the diagnosis but starred including chicken + eggs daily in my diet. Added in a protein shake in my coffee. 
- Reduced fruit consumption which I ate a lot of . Obviously cut most sugar sources out as well 
- CGM -  every body is different and learning what makes you spike makes the most difference.

1. Using freshly ground robusta coffee, ground just a few minutes before brewing
2. Using a fine-coarse grind
3. Placing one filter paper above the coffee basket in the moka pot

But what can happen when your safety net is just a solid tightrope? You can never put all of your eggs in one basket.This year, I learned a few valuable lessons, the most important being that our lives are in constant change. Maybe the waters are calm but the tide moves the sand in which our feet are standing. Even in the safest and shallowest part of the ocean, the tide can make you move and fall over. That was me this year, I just felt like everything was under control and I had a secure job but then external factors changed the game and my worst fears and innermost desires came true. The inertia of the ambition driving my life, kept me pushing forward in a lonely path in which I felt spiritually detached from my surroundings. Having trouble trusting people, I trusted a few and felt like myself again after 3 years of being encapsulated by the lack of nuances in college. Coming back to my home country felt like a turmoil of emotions, the first one was excitement about seeing my friends more often. The casual coffee or lunch every now and then… Or perhaps more texting since we were living in the same city. But it was not a spatial-temporal constraint which kept us apart, it was the emotional connection which was lacking. What happens when you run out of common ground and the memories are blown away like ashes? When you softly smile and nod when they keep talking but don’t reciprocate and listen back? How can you make new friends and drill through the small talk core? Why are we so afraid of being real, being raw? How has the growing radicalism on social media shaped our interpersonal relationships to the point in which any topic could be controversial? What happens when you no longer connect with your old friends who were supposed to be your safety net and find it hard to make new ones in today’s loneliness?

Base expansion

They could make the shop bigger with new areas. The roof outside looks very high for the shop building. You could add a upper floor to the shop where you can sell more items like food types, camping gear, flash lights or other lighting types, survival gear, tech gear and medical supplies. This upper floor could be locked at level 2 and have items/equipment at a range of level 2 and higher.

You can make a basement floor shop where higher level weapons, Ammo types, equipment, items and gear is sold. Make the entry to this level a higher level req.

They could make a gym in the base where you have to do physical mini games like creed VR or something then Eat, Sleep and in time you get more strength with added levels so you can carry more gear.  Have some for stamina and other aspects.

You should make a outside area behind the base that is a wooded area with a lake. Where we can hang out and hunt for deer in the woods and fish in the lake to get food. And we can use it as a training area. >> If added ->> cooking food, camping, setting traps, starting fires, purifying water, handing out and so on.

Other Drinkable items: Beer, Vodka but adds negative effects.

Energy drinks, coffee maker for stamina or energy vs sleep effect if added.

Make sleep like 1.0 but under a Optional Difficulty mode.

Have different size bed rolls, or you can carry a blanket like the ones I see at the base.

A blanket could be used in cold areas if hardcore mode is added.

Different sizes tents could be carried in the weapon holster like that device that you pick up on a mission and set up for you and your buddies take shelter if you are not near a safe house in a huge map.

New Radius new inner/inside zone areas. To explore or for missions.

Ammo types for bullets:

Copper Hollow Point (CHP): Best used for flesh, Gel, soft ash type Entities.

Ballistic Plastic Tip (BPT): Plastic tip over a hollow point. Combines accuracy with expansion. Best used for flesh, Gel, soft ash type Entities.

Boat Tail (BT): Tapered rear for better aerodynamics. Used in long-range shooting.

Explosive Rounds (ER): Used for heavy armored Entities and area effect damage.

New Lighters and fire sources:

Lighters Condition effects how hard is it to light the Lighter and if it keeps on going out and how big the flame is.

Optional Difficulty or just in game:   Lighters should have a gas or fuel level and lowers slowly when used and are useless when empty or could be used for parts.

The Bic disposable lighter. the ones in the game now. These can't be refilled. Could loot with different Condition and fluid levels.

Butane torch lighter can be refilled with Butane cans. You can find the torch lighter full or almost empty. Butane torch lighter are brighter but louder. could melt stuff?

Max of 25 matches per box.

Other fire starting supplies: Tinder, paper/ paper roll that can be looted at different quantities. Paper roll 25 sheets per roll max

playing Into The Radius 2 beta I see there is wooden sticks around in the woods maybe this could be picked up and used for Camp fire making, Torches and other crafting objects.

Starting fires and camp fires: For light, cooking. Maybe keep warm in cold areas.

Building a camp fire on the ground depents on how good you build it. Not using some blueprint like green hell. But on how much wood and how well did you place the wood on the ground and how much tinder or dry leaves did you use.

Metal drum fire or stove fire at the shelters or outside only lasts as long as how much wood or other objects like coal, books, trash and etc etc.

Stove used for cooking. Cooking food gives you Added bonus and keep food longer before it will go's bad.  Maybe cooking raw food fills you up the most.

Different size Candles: Candle light could have low lumens but lights the area around it. Last a limited amount of time. Good to keep visiblity down. Vs how many you have lit.

Hand Flares: Flares you can hold used as a bright light source and can burn entities.

Shootable flares like into the radius 1.

Making Torches from different supplies. tree branches, dried leaves, Rope, Fatty oil, Small twigs. Light with fire sources. Same with building Camp fires.

Oil lamp: Req Wick and oil. Very bright lights up area around it. Heavy can be connect to bag or put in bag when off. Can burst in flames if shot.

Kerosene Lantern: Req Kerosene. Very bright 5x vs oil lamp lights up area around it. Heavy can be connect to bag or put in bag when off. Can burst in flames if shot.

propane tanks found in the radius could be used at the base or at the shelters for different uses.  Cooking grills, other type of generators.

Gas cans: can be used to collect gas from gas stations holding tanks or pumps or siphoned out cars/vehicles to use in generators to power safe houses or base.

We have to find a fuse or find away to get the power back on so the pump works.



Gas could be made with the right chemicals.  


Propane tanks, large green water jugs and Gas cans must be carried by hand when filled or empty. Maybe empty plastic water jugs and small gas can can be put in back pack.

Other Lightable objects

Lightable Smoke bombs: More smoke then pull tab smoke bombs and last longer. Can be thrown and use fuse extension and can be tape together to make bigger smoke bomb will increase weight

Dynamite stick: High explosive, can be thrown, can use a roll of tape to stick Dynamite together will increase weight, can add fuse extension

M-80 stick: Med explosive, can be thrown, can use a roll of tape to stick M-80 together will increase weight, can add fuse extension

String of Fuse: for combining fuses and adding longer fuse time.

Other fire works: Rockets, Missiles, mortor ball. Can be used as weapons to attack, set traps or to just mess around.

Flash Lights and Light sources::

Add Batteries for Optional difficulty?

Batteries For flashlights. Batteries should have one Status bars. charge. Battery charge how long it lasts. Flashlight condition has difference effects on the flash light.

Different Flashlights have different size light beams and brightness and smaller flashlights weight less.

Same with headlamp and pocket lamp.

Battery powered Lantern: Takes more Batteries very bright and lights up area round it but heavier.

Glow sticks that are not has bright low area glow and last a limited amount of time depend on the size. Entities have harder time seeing them.

4 hour glow stick, 8 hour glow stick, 12 hour glow stick. Weight and price go up vs size and time.

Night eye Art: Same like into the radius one only found in the zone.

Night vision goggles: Req Batteries, Low FOV depending on version. Buy at basement shop at base.

Optional difficulty:  Using generators you can charge you gear or chargeable Batteries. They could run other equipment also.

Crazy idea:  
Idea Some of the later in game safehouses don't have light or power or the main base can get A power out. So you have to find parts and build a generator to get things up and running.  Or if main base has a powerout you have to go into the radius and find a fuse.  you can find and stock up or fuses and generator parts.  Sparkplugs, coils, pumps, and so on. more stuff to horde.   We can put them together like snaping part by part like how weapons are built now.

  
Parts can be found or taken out of broken down cars or vehicles.  

  


Some crafting ideas and items used for it.

Other weapon maintenance systems:

Devices/Tools that we can be buy, build or find:

Gun Parts cleaning tank req chem to use,

A grinder for Fixing parts or sharping knifes,

A mill to make new gun parts from blue prints and req metal,

A ammo loader but we can make own custom rounds.

modding the firearm Receiver: The main body of the firearm that houses the operating parts: Triggers, springs and so on. to fix or Mod like Changing rate of firing speed and so on.

Plant of the radius. You should add like 10 common, 5 uncommon, 3 rare and 1 ultra rare plants to the radius that we and find and use in the lab to make medicines, poison to tip are rounds, Entities replent and etc.

Many types of chemicals to make explosives, fuels, fireworks,

Survival Kits: Mix chemicals into anti-rad packs, or fire starters.

Protective Gear: Crafting or upgrading armor with chemical treatments to resist anomalies or environmental hazards.

chemicals for crafting:

Isopropyl Alcohol: Disinfectant and solvent Weapon cleaning, sterilizing wounds.

Hydrogen Peroxide: Antiseptic and oxidizer Healing minor injuries, crafting explosives and explosives traps.

Potassium Iodide pills: Blocks radioactive iodine absorption Radiation protection in contaminated zones

Gunpowder, Different types of acids, Sulfur, Ethanol, Carbon, Salt, Distilled alcohol, powdered iron, Mercury.

Other house hold items/chemicals: Soap, grease, bleach, oil, moth balls, Baking soda and ect.

Optional Difficulty:: Radioactive objects and radiation in areas.

Areas that have Radioactive and radiation elements to them and that can damage you.

Your wrist band beeps when near Radioactive / radiation but don't really gives you a location just beeps to indicator of it.

Radiation meter on wrist show how much you are effected and could be damage from the radiation poisoning.

Radiation level:: Will cause death if to high.

Use Geiger counter to find location of the radiation and level.

Geiger counter uses Batteries.

Use Potassium Iodide pills to dull effects of the radiation poisoning.

Use something like Radiacwash  to clean radiation off player.

More suits to protect from radiation.

Rail car Heals radiation poisoning 100% for money

Radiation poisoning effects Healing speed, Stamina and other effects.

Optional Difficulty:: Drinking water and hydration system and starvation.

It will be required to drink clean water or die from dehydration. Could add a new light blue bar on wrist that shows hydration levels.

Food and starvation green bar next to yellow bar. When yellow bar is very low from hunger the green bar starts to lower. If green bar is gone you die. Yellow bar cant be refilled

until green starvation bar is filled. So more food must be eaten.

Energy drinks have very low effect on hydration levels but still good for energy.

Clean plastic Bottled Water: Rare to find in the radius and expensive at shop.

Can find or buy empty plastic bottles for refill.

You can later buy a back mounted CamelBak water holder or different sizes vs weight.

You start with one drinking canteen water bottle. That could be mounted on new mount location on waist or backpack how you set it up. You can loot or buy more canteen water bottles and keep them in backpack.

You Find water from Ponds and swamps but you need to use water disinfection tablets to clean the water. Or the dirty water will damage you.

Disinfection tablets Loot found in different tablet quantities. Can buy at shop at different quantities and prices.

Maybe boiling water in a pot on a fire to clean water. or water filters. Depends how dirty the water is.

Filtering radioactive elements from red water must be done in the lab.

When playing into the radius 2 I see green Jugs maybe with can use them to collect water.

The the metal camping mug and metal UNPC metal mug can be used to boil water.

Maybe you can add bigger pots also.

I’m a commuter student and thought I wouldn’t make any friends, but the moment I got here on the first day of orientation I was immediately surrounded by so many incredible people who I got along with so well. It may be because I’m in the one stream so my classes are much smaller but I’ve found a lovely groove with my classmates and we all study together and get food and walk around nearly every day, and the friends I made at orientation I still see at least once a week for coffee and just to hang out. I really don’t understand why people say the social life here sucks, all you have to do is make an effort. Basically what I’m saying is for future students lurking this sub don’t let what people are saying about the social life here fool you. You will find your people. ",1,1759645535.0,EEP,0,1.0,False

This experimental kiosk café is installed at KidZania, Dubai Ice Rink, and other attractions. Guests queue not just for the coffee but for selfies with the robot, which is fully interactive: it talks, tells personalized jokes, and puts on a mini-show.

According to developers, this machine not only attracts crowds but also pays back the investment in about a year — ROI between 80% and 150%. These robots are already ordered worldwide—in France, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and now even the USA.
