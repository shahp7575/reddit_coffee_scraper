1p7bu1f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p7bu1f,"It's amazing what you can do with trash, a gimlet and a few zip ties","I've spent all summer looking for a foldable table for my tiny balcony. Couldn't find one in my area, nor did I want to buy one online, as I feel kinda cursed when it comes to deliveries.

  
There was this broken foldable laundry basket from the previous renter just laying around, so I broke it even further and mounted it on the railing. Then I procrastinated the rest of the process for a few more months.

  
A few days ago I found this triangular coffee table in the trash with its 3 legs missing. I saw the potential and snatched it right away. I unscrewed the 2 metal thingies, flipped their orientation, inserted zip ties before screwing them back on, and attached the table to the white tube. Then I pierced two wholes and carved a space for the final zip tie to be embedded in.

  
The last metal thingy was also missing, revealing a hole that's 1 cm in depth and 2 cm in diameter. Which happens to be the ideal place to put a stick in, so as to make the whole thing complete and functional. I found a walking stick at the thrift store (the cashier is now definitely convinced that I'm a weirdo), cut it to the right length, and boom! Just goes perfectly into the hole. I used a glass of water as level.   


Total cost: 2 euros. Certainly looks like shit, but it's sturdy and serves its purpose. I'll try to find some adhesive with a nice pattern to hide the holes and scratches later. I know it's a bit late to be enjoying my balcony now that winter is almost here, but I'm still happy I made it! Sorry about the picture quality btw, my phone is ancient.

1p7bswl,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1p7bswl/extremely_long_post_really_needing_advice_on_a/,*extremely long post* really needing advice on a potentially hostile and toxic work environment,"I’ve worked in a toxic work environment for over a year, about a year and a half. I could put up with it because I worked a very solitary job (night shift, housekeeping) and just did my job and got out. When I first started that job, there were some complaints because I worked with my sister and my supervisor felt I was leaning on her too much (or so she said, idk) so at the first opportunity I transferred to night shift (away from my sister) and in the time I was on night shift I got no complaints. I actually got a lot of compliments on my work. But still, the environment wasn’t the best and a new position opened up in a different department. 

I applied and let my supervisor and manager know and they were pretty cool about it, said the would put in a good word. I got the new job, about 2 months ago, working in the gas station on the same company property. This gas station is also kind of small restaurant, so I’m technically a line cook as well. 

It has been. fucking. awful. I feel I am being targeted and multiple people agree with me, they say this is basically par for the course with this job. I do make more money here and I am not able to transfer back to my old position. 

My new manager is very strange. He does not talk to me at all, and mostly I just see him on his phone watching videos or listening to audio books out loud. He has a few people under him who do all of the day to day things and “handle” employees. Things started strangely as soon as I started. 

The first week I worked there, my training week, the person who was supposed to train me called out the entire week. My manager did not come in, no one did. So they put me on the register and had another coworker (who is very nice but also just coasting on seniority, he’s an old man who literally just watches tik tok all day) help me with that. That entire week I just did the register and made coffee. So when I went to my permanent shift, I didn’t know much which I was fully transparent about. 

Then I got on my permanent shift (graveyard, again) and we were understaffed. I couldn’t get very much time in the kitchen, maybe 1 or 2 hours a week, because I had to do cashiering while my coworker did everything in the back. I could tell they were burnt out but I literally could not do anything. During this time, the person who was supposed to train me during my initial training week kept saying she would come in on some of the nights I worked and help me out but she never did. So I kinda slipped through the cracks, and all I could do was ask questions and try to learn as much as I could when I had time. 

Literally a month in, a lead from a different shift came in on my shift and pulled me aside. He told me that there had been complaints that I was not pulling my weight, that I looked “lost” and “high”. I told him that that didn’t feel fair, I had only been there 1 month and hadn’t received nearly as much training as I was supposed to and often I did feel lost but there was literally no one to help me. I also told him that I am not high at all at work and I do not consume marijuana before my shift. I told him about how I only had one day a week, in my 4 day week, to get kitchen training (or be helped in other areas, when my coworker was not doing everything in the kitchen) and up to that point I had only worked 3 Saturdays as I had been ill on one Saturday. 

He seemed to see my point and agreed my training was not up to standard and I would be receiving more help. The next day, a Saturday, the person who was supposed to train me came in early as she always does on a Saturday to stock. She was very hostile with me (confirmed by another coworker) and made a comment about me “telling (lead) that (I) haven’t been trained or something” I told her, yeah I haven’t been and she “showed” me how to do a few things very roughly. 

I continued to try my best and learn where I could. Eventually, they hired another person for the shift I work and we were finally fully staffed. I was relieved because now we could have more balance and time for training. The person my manager hired happened to be his best friend’s wife, who also lives with him. She came on and things have just steadily gone down hill. 

She complains about everything I do, constantly does tasks herself and then says I am not helping. When I tell her I will do those tasks (i.e. cleaning the fryers) she tells me that she will do it because she is faster than me, but then she tells our manager and other people that I am not helping. She gets upset if I offer to help, she gets upset if I assert that I will be doing *task*, and she gets upset if I leave it to her to do. I truly do not understand how I can make her happy. I told her we should have more communication and she snapped at me and said I was having a “title attitude with her” and I told her I was sorry it seemed that way, that wasn’t my intent. She gave me an apology that seemed kind of weird. 

This coworker (A) is very close with my manager (because she lives with him) and another coworker who I feel does not like me, as well as the person who was initially supposed to train me (E). I can tell when they have been talking about me. It all feels very exclusionary and honestly like highschool, which is frustrating as I am 27 and they are all considerably older than me. 

About 2 or so weeks ago, my manager came in on my shift which has never happened. He called me into his office and was upset that I had not done a training module which was overdue, I took full responsibility and told him I was sorry and I would do it asap (I completed it that night on my lunch). He brought up how I am still in my probationary period, which didn’t really make sense to me as I was with the company for over a year before I came to this department. Looking back on it, it feels like a threat. He then said that I needed to “move faster” and I said “in what way?” And he said “in every way. Everything”. I asked specifics and he just kept saying “everything”, he would not clarify or give me specifics at all. Then he told me that working with me feels like walking behind someone who is really slow and frustrating, though he had never worked with me. 

After this, I cried but got it together to do my job. I talked with a coworker I trust to be honest with me and she said that she felt I was still just getting the hang of things and acknowledged my lack of training, and gave me some specific time goals to meet. I started timing myself doing things honestly I do not feel I am that slow. The day after that my friend and coworker urged me to speak to our union rep and I did. I told him about another thing that had happened, where my manager gave my shift schedule to (A) and didn’t inform me even though that’s not supposed to be the protocol. The reason I was given was that “(A) has a kid with autism”. The union rep seemed upset at that, because that is the manager giving special favors to his roommate. When I told him how long it takes me to clean the fryer, he was pretty impressed and said that that is a good time. I was advised to document and I have been. But everyone knows I have been talking to union rep. 

Since then I have been putting in a lot of work. I time myself with most things and I stay busy, if I complete all the tasks then I clean or face merchandise or stock. Obviously I am not perfect but I am trying like hell to improve and I have been told I have been. 

A few nights ago I was working and (A) seemed very upset, right away. It was the night where I have had the most problems, where it’s me, (A) and the other coworker who doesn’t like me but is closer with (A) and (E) (I’ll just refer to her as B). I went to clean the fryer after my break and informed (B) and (A). (B) seemed to not like this, as I believe her and (A) had already discussed (A) cleaning them both because is faster than me, and this is what usually happens. I told her I had already talked to (A) and we agreed, and left. When I got to the back (A) was doing another task and I informed her I was back from break and would be starting the fryer. She was upset and told me to just go relieve (B) because the oil was too hot. I disagreed and said it was fine and that she could also go relieve (B), as her task was just a side task we do when we have time and not time sensitive like cleaning the fryer. We got interrupted and then following that she made several angry and hostile statements to me, and I immediately went into “gentle parent” mode and tried to diffuse the situation. At one point she said “well I’m not the one who had to have the manager come in and talk to them about their performance” and I asked her if she felt that was a helpful comment, which made her more upset. Eventually I left and about 15 minutes later she came to me to “apologize” in a way that felt very manipulative, and started to cry. She said she “doesn’t know why (she’s) treating (me) this way or taking things out on (me).” I was very gentle with her but didn’t comfort her, just told her if she needed to take some time to herself I had everything handled. After that it seemed like she tried very hard to be friendly with me, and I was civil with her. 


3 days ago, my union rep asked to speak with me. He told me essentially that my manager acknowledges that I have improved but that he wants to fire me, and my union rep is unsure if this is something that will happen because of the confusion on if I’m in a probationary period or not. He said (A) now had specific complaints, one being that I apparently walk “too slow” and “lumber around” which honestly just feels…hurtful. Another coworker has gone to him and backed me up on a lot of things which is nice. I was given advice to do things that I honestly already feel I am doing. While talking to my union rep he essentially told me that this place has a history or bullying and that it happens to everyone. 


I’m not sure what to do, obviously I’m going to keep doing my job and watching my ass and applying to every single job I can, but I can’t afford to just quit. I don’t know if I should attempt to bring this up with HR? Or just let my union rep handle this?? I was seen talking with my union rep and I am fearing retaliation, because clearly that is something they do. I feel it’s important to say that in the entire time I have worked there I have never received any disciplinary action, no write ups or warnings or anything. 

I probably haven’t covered everything, so much happens day to day and I’m so burnt out on this. I will try to answer any questions if possible. ",1,1764173629.0,WorkAdvice,0,1.0,False

The master list includes a large chunk up to and including tier 3 (apart from faction chests, skins and furniture). 

Why only tier 3? Because a majority of items then break down in separate .0 to .4 (i.e you go from 1 chestnut log to 5 different pine logs). If I still build this deep is still to be determined primarily by if the Notion database can load - I would like to hear your input on that.

I will eventually release a t4+ version, but there's not enough hours in the day to do it any time soon (if anyone wants to buy me a coffee so I can burn the midnight oil, I won't say no).

The recipes for crafting are also present, though again not all of them. You may also notice that some ingredients might not show in the same order as in game, or start in later slots - this is deliberate to stop the formula effectively counting the wrong stock.

Ledger now correctly adds and subtracts, as does crafting (and even now has a refund column for when you get materials back).

There is now a handy dandy farm efficiency page, that does the math for you. Note, numbers are not necessarily accurate and I advise you put in your own numbers to check.

Known issues:
-Pie chart requires a screen refresh to update. Apparently it's just too much content. 
-Some items may not be tagged correctly or are no longer in play(if you find one let me know).
-yes, I'm probably missing a bunch of fish, and crops.
-Required list doesn't behave correctly and will not filter to only show required items. This may be temporarily scrapped while I work on the core more.
-Recipe formula will need a tidy up at some point.",1,1764173626.0,albiononline,0,1.0,False

So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

[Safe or Not](https://www.safeornot.space/community)

You can search for 'Bangkok' or 'Vietnam' for example

Not because I didn't have ideas. Because I didn't have photos.

Sounds stupid when I say it out loud, but here's the pattern:

- Write LinkedIn post ✅

- Get to ""add image"" button ⏸️

- Don't have a good photo 🚫

- Think ""I'll post tomorrow"" 🔁

- Never post 💀

This killed my visibility for months.

Then I found Looktara on RocketHub's Black Friday sale.

Here's what it does:

Upload 30 photos → AI trains on YOUR face specifically → generates professional photos on demand in 5 seconds.

Type: _""me in a gray blazer, confident but approachable""

Output: Studio-quality photo that looks exactly like you.

My results so far:

Been using it for 4 hours. Generated 40+ photos.

Different settings:

- Office backgrounds

- Casual coffee shop vibes

- Speaking/presenting poses

- Professional headshots

- Relaxed ""behind the scenes"" style

All look genuinely like me. Not uncanny valley. Not generic AI faces.

The business impact:

I can finally post DAILY without worrying about having the ""right photo.""

That consistency is what actually drives engagement and trust on LinkedIn.

One photoshoot = $500 and you get maybe 10 usable photos.

This = one-time payment on RocketHub, unlimited photos forever.

3 days ago, my union rep asked to speak with me. He told me essentially that my manager acknowledges that I have improved but that he wants to fire me, and my union rep is unsure if this is something that will happen because of the confusion on if I’m in a probationary period or not. He said (A) now had specific complaints, one being that I apparently walk “too slow” and “lumber around” which honestly just feels…hurtful. Another coworker has gone to him and backed me up on a lot of things which is nice. I was given advice to do things that I honestly already feel I am doing. While talking to my union rep he essentially told me that this place has a history or bullying and that it happens to everyone. 


I’m not sure what to do, obviously I’m going to keep doing my job and watching my ass and applying to every single job I can, but I can’t afford to just quit. I don’t know if I should attempt to bring this up with HR? Or just let my union rep handle this?? I was seen talking with my union rep and I am fearing retaliation, because clearly that is something they do. I feel it’s important to say that in the entire time I have worked there I have never received any disciplinary action, no write ups or warnings or anything. 

I probably haven’t covered everything, so much happens day to day and I’m so burnt out on this. I will try to answer any questions if possible. ",1,1764173460.0,coworkerstories,0,1.0,False

It is. I've been sick as crap since returning from Scotland and DOSbox has been healing me with nostalgia from my youth as a baby nerd. 

Anyways, here's some reviews of some AoE scents I ordered along with some cozy(ish) game recs that are definitively **not** the games they're inspired by because I'm old and contrary. Now read my reviews or get off my lawn, you whippersnappers. 

**My Usual Preferences: woody, forest, incense, florals and other nature smells. Not a big gourmand fan, but I like gourmands with an earthy twist ok.** 

(These only rested a couple days because I have no chill but I was super sick so they rested more than usual lol.)

🏜🌵🏜🌵🏜🌵🏜🌵

**Mojave Wasteland-** Dry sand, amber and gasoline. Something in this smells remarkably like Alkemia's rubbery industrial note. Desertpunk atmospheric. Bang on for the inspiration but not crazy wearable for me. The throw is really low but the rollerball is also barely dispensing so that might be part of the problem. **Wear While Playing: My Time in Sandrock**

**Notes:** _desert sand, white amber, fall leaves, dark amber, gasoline, cactus blossom, campfire, copal, musk_

🐎🎶🐎🎶🐎🎶🐎🎶

**Stable Trotter-** starts out with a juicy apple reminiscent of the apple in my other apple favs. It warms up from crisp apple to cozy autumnal farmer's market in a Hallmark movie. Sweet, gently spiced apple (no aggressive apple cinnamon candle vibes) and nutty grains. It gets more rounded and sweet in non cloying way as it dries. This is really nice actually. I should've got a 3ml of this but pumpkin usually goes horrid on me, so I hesitated. **Wear While Playing: Fields of Mystria**

**Notes:** _golden apple, corn, pumpkin flesh, harvest spice, wheat, rice, leather, roasted chestnut, animalic musk, cedarwood_

⛰️🏞⛰️🏞⛰️🏞⛰️🏞

**Breath of the Wild-** lemongrass for sure. The tomato leaf adds a fuller greenness to it that makes me think of picking lemongrass in my garden. This is really tart and refreshing. Definitely makes me think of the panning wide shots of Hyrule. **Wear While Playing: Coral Island**

**Notes:** _basil, tomato leaf, lemongrass, stone, soft musk, leather_

🪔🏚🪔🏚🪔🏚🪔🏚

**Little Lamplight-** Is MacCready my favorite Fallout character? *Yes.* Did I buy this just in case it works even though the notes were very not my thing? *Also yes.* And yknow what? It worked! This is...a weird one. Blackberry soda, ink and oil combine to make something that makes me think of gun oil if it was berry scented. The blackberry is this is nice, not gummy-ish or candy. The clove starts to show up and give the whole thing a sense of warmth, like the light of an oil lamp against the dark. I got a 3ml but i might go back for a bigger bottle as well. It's definitely unique in my collection. **Wear While Playing: Penko Park**

**Notes:** _ink, blackberry jam, parchment, clove, copal, oil, cola_

🍄‍🟫🎃🍄‍🟫🎃🍄‍🟫🎃🍄‍🟫🎃

**Hateno Village-** Another one that was suspicious but I trusted the process. The mushroom is very there but not dank, like clean chopped baby bellas. The pumpkin is lightly spiced and the ink gives it a cool-toned atmospheric vibe. This is nice, drier and less sweet than Stable Trotters. It almost reminds me of.... something. Very helpful i know. Definitely fall vibes. I like it but I don't love it. I'll probably keep the sample though. I don't have anything like this really. **Wear While Playing: Tales of Seikyu**

**Notes:** _sweet pumpkin, mushroom, tonka bean, lavender, vanilla bean, ink accord_

👹🐗👹🐗👹🐗👹🐗

**Demon King-** ooh. Smoky spicy coffee and ink. This absolutely brings Calamity Ganon to mind. Murky, smoky, dry. The anise is perfectly balanced and gives this an otherworldly, mystical vibe. Smelling this blind I probably would've guessed Possets. It has that kind of vibe to it, with the dry incense + anise combo. **Wear While Playing: Trash Goblin**

**Notes:** _smoke, black coffee, anise, labdanum, ink accord, dark patchouli, copal, clove, oakmoss, dark sandalwood_

🐁🍂🐁🍂🐁🍂🐁🍂

**Bloomburrow-** Chamomile and something like a grey amber note? They always read kind of astringent to me. I smell the pumpkin under there, now that I know what AoE's Pumpkin smells like, but whatever this note is (the fur? The rice milk?) is going buckwild. This reminds me so much of something but I cannot pinpoint it. Cat at the Table? Maybe? It feels grey to me.  It gets warmer as it goes but its still not my jam. **Wear While Playing: Winter Burrow**

**Notes:** _chamomile, saffron, fir, fall leaves, forest, pumpkin, soft fur, rice milk, french toast_

🌩🏜🌩🏜🌩🏜🌩🏜

**Thunder Junction-** ozone? Sea water and the smell of an impending storm. I don't get any petrichor, it's more the scent of rain in the air. Humid, almost.  Leather and gunpowder in the background. This feels clean and fresh without being generic soap for mans. Sage kinda wafting in and out. This was a freebie and I like it a lot more than expected. A clean industrial aquatic lol. **Wear While Playing: Dinkum**

**Notes:** _cactus blossom, bone accord, sage, leather, gunpowder, stout beer accord, thunderstorm accord, patchouli, tobacco, sea salt_

💀🌑💀🌑💀🌑💀🌑

**Duskmourn-** Spices and dry dusty notes. Like a whiff of what used to be in an old spice cabinet. Oh it's mushroom again. I was not into this in the vial but as it's drying I'm liking it more. It smells like warm dry air in an abandoned place. This definitely has something in common with Thunder Junction. It almost smells like musty old books. The well-loved and crumbling kind. I bet this would layer phenomenonily with CLST Mushmallow! It definitely nails the vibe, but idk how often I'd reach for this. **Wear While Playing: Disco Elysium**

**Notes:** _bone accord, copal, dark patchouli, carnation, wax, blood accord, black pepper, oud, teakwood, mushroom, dragon's blood_

This was a fun foray into a house I don't have a ton of experience or success with. I actually really love Stable Trotter and went back for a fullsize. I'm apparently a sucker for good apple and grain notes lol. Breath of the Wild and Little Lamplight are staying as well as the sample of Hateno. I grabbed some other FSes since I was ordering so wish me much on those. Overall the throw was fairly low, except Hateno, which had no chill, so lore accurate to TotK. But they were all fairly unique, Breath being the one that I have found similar scents to, but still enjoyable enough to keep. Sometimes I just wanna be lemongrass.

1p7blxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p7blxo/this_is_extremely_long_but_i_am_in_a_toxic/,This is extremely long but I am in a toxic workplace and feel like I’m losing my mind,"I’ve worked in a toxic work environment for over a year, about a year and a half. I could put up with it because I worked a very solitary job (night shift, housekeeping) and just did my job and got out. When I first started that job, there were some complaints because I worked with my sister and my supervisor felt I was leaning on her too much (or so she said, idk) so at the first opportunity I transferred to night shift (away from my sister) and in the time I was on night shift I got no complaints. I actually got a lot of compliments on my work. But still, the environment wasn’t the best and a new position opened up in a different department. 

I applied and let my supervisor and manager know and they were pretty cool about it, said the would put in a good word. I got the new job, about 2 months ago, working in the gas station on the same company property. This gas station is also kind of small restaurant, so I’m technically a line cook as well. 

It has been. fucking. awful. I feel I am being targeted and multiple people agree with me, they say this is basically par for the course with this job. I do make more money here and I am not able to transfer back to my old position. 

My new manager is very strange. He does not talk to me at all, and mostly I just see him on his phone watching videos or listening to audio books out loud. He has a few people under him who do all of the day to day things and “handle” employees. Things started strangely as soon as I started. 

The first week I worked there, my training week, the person who was supposed to train me called out the entire week. My manager did not come in, no one did. So they put me on the register and had another coworker (who is very nice but also just coasting on seniority, he’s an old man who literally just watches tik tok all day) help me with that. That entire week I just did the register and made coffee. So when I went to my permanent shift, I didn’t know much which I was fully transparent about. 

Then I got on my permanent shift (graveyard, again) and we were understaffed. I couldn’t get very much time in the kitchen, maybe 1 or 2 hours a week, because I had to do cashiering while my coworker did everything in the back. I could tell they were burnt out but I literally could not do anything. During this time, the person who was supposed to train me during my initial training week kept saying she would come in on some of the nights I worked and help me out but she never did. So I kinda slipped through the cracks, and all I could do was ask questions and try to learn as much as I could when I had time. 

Literally a month in, a lead from a different shift came in on my shift and pulled me aside. He told me that there had been complaints that I was not pulling my weight, that I looked “lost” and “high”. I told him that that didn’t feel fair, I had only been there 1 month and hadn’t received nearly as much training as I was supposed to and often I did feel lost but there was literally no one to help me. I also told him that I am not high at all at work and I do not consume marijuana before my shift. I told him about how I only had one day a week, in my 4 day week, to get kitchen training (or be helped in other areas, when my coworker was not doing everything in the kitchen) and up to that point I had only worked 3 Saturdays as I had been ill on one Saturday. 

He seemed to see my point and agreed my training was not up to standard and I would be receiving more help. The next day, a Saturday, the person who was supposed to train me came in early as she always does on a Saturday to stock. She was very hostile with me (confirmed by another coworker) and made a comment about me “telling (lead) that (I) haven’t been trained or something” I told her, yeah I haven’t been and she “showed” me how to do a few things very roughly. 

I continued to try my best and learn where I could. Eventually, they hired another person for the shift I work and we were finally fully staffed. I was relieved because now we could have more balance and time for training. The person my manager hired happened to be his best friend’s wife, who also lives with him. She came on and things have just steadily gone down hill. 

She complains about everything I do, constantly does tasks herself and then says I am not helping. When I tell her I will do those tasks (i.e. cleaning the fryers) she tells me that she will do it because she is faster than me, but then she tells our manager and other people that I am not helping. She gets upset if I offer to help, she gets upset if I assert that I will be doing *task*, and she gets upset if I leave it to her to do. I truly do not understand how I can make her happy. I told her we should have more communication and she snapped at me and said I was having a “title attitude with her” and I told her I was sorry it seemed that way, that wasn’t my intent. She gave me an apology that seemed kind of weird. 

This coworker (A) is very close with my manager (because she lives with him) and another coworker who I feel does not like me, as well as the person who was initially supposed to train me (E). I can tell when they have been talking about me. It all feels very exclusionary and honestly like highschool, which is frustrating as I am 27 and they are all considerably older than me. 

About 2 or so weeks ago, my manager came in on my shift which has never happened. He called me into his office and was upset that I had not done a training module which was overdue, I took full responsibility and told him I was sorry and I would do it asap (I completed it that night on my lunch). He brought up how I am still in my probationary period, which didn’t really make sense to me as I was with the company for over a year before I came to this department. Looking back on it, it feels like a threat. He then said that I needed to “move faster” and I said “in what way?” And he said “in every way. Everything”. I asked specifics and he just kept saying “everything”, he would not clarify or give me specifics at all. Then he told me that working with me feels like walking behind someone who is really slow and frustrating, though he had never worked with me. 

After this, I cried but got it together to do my job. I talked with a coworker I trust to be honest with me and she said that she felt I was still just getting the hang of things and acknowledged my lack of training, and gave me some specific time goals to meet. I started timing myself doing things honestly I do not feel I am that slow. The day after that my friend and coworker urged me to speak to our union rep and I did. I told him about another thing that had happened, where my manager gave my shift schedule to (A) and didn’t inform me even though that’s not supposed to be the protocol. The reason I was given was that “(A) has a kid with autism”. The union rep seemed upset at that, because that is the manager giving special favors to his roommate. When I told him how long it takes me to clean the fryer, he was pretty impressed and said that that is a good time. I was advised to document and I have been. But everyone knows I have been talking to union rep. 

Since then I have been putting in a lot of work. I time myself with most things and I stay busy, if I complete all the tasks then I clean or face merchandise or stock. Obviously I am not perfect but I am trying like hell to improve and I have been told I have been. 

A few nights ago I was working and (A) seemed very upset, right away. It was the night where I have had the most problems, where it’s me, (A) and the other coworker who doesn’t like me but is closer with (A) and (E) (I’ll just refer to her as B). I went to clean the fryer after my break and informed (B) and (A). (B) seemed to not like this, as I believe her and (A) had already discussed (A) cleaning them both because is faster than me, and this is what usually happens. I told her I had already talked to (A) and we agreed, and left. When I got to the back (A) was doing another task and I informed her I was back from break and would be starting the fryer. She was upset and told me to just go relieve (B) because the oil was too hot. I disagreed and said it was fine and that she could also go relieve (B), as her task was just a side task we do when we have time and not time sensitive like cleaning the fryer. We got interrupted and then following that she made several angry and hostile statements to me, and I immediately went into “gentle parent” mode and tried to diffuse the situation. At one point she said “well I’m not the one who had to have the manager come in and talk to them about their performance” and I asked her if she felt that was a helpful comment, which made her more upset. Eventually I left and about 15 minutes later she came to me to “apologize” in a way that felt very manipulative, and started to cry. She said she “doesn’t know why (she’s) treating (me) this way or taking things out on (me).” I was very gentle with her but didn’t comfort her, just told her if she needed to take some time to herself I had everything handled. After that it seemed like she tried very hard to be friendly with me, and I was civil with her.

[**Teacher [40sF] called me[19F] out in front of the class, asking if I am an adult and making me admit I don't have $10 to spend on school supplies**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pipnj/teacher_40sf_called_me19f_out_in_front_of_the/)

This isn't the most important or dramatic thing ever, but I'm really upset right now and I don't know what to do.

I'm in a figure sculpting class at my community college, and I've been having a hard time. I've never worked in clay before, let alone made figure sculptures out of it. Good clay was expensive at the store she recommended we go to, and it was a large heavy block so I was under the impression we didn't need to buy more. I just smashed all of my work when we were done, I didn't like them anyway.

There has been a piece here and there where my teacher (I'll say Mary) has asked if I want to fire them (put them in a furnace to harden them). I always said no, I need the clay from the piece because I can't afford to buy more. She assured me she has recycled clay, that I should keep some of my pieces, but I didn't want to.

I'm also having a hard time financially. I work a job slightly above min wage, and I'm not given many hours. I'm struggling at that job, too, and that's been a great source of stress for me.

I haven't been the biggest fan of Mary so far. She hasn't taught this class before, and for people who've never used clay in their life, I didn't feel like she explained enough about the medium, she just threw us in and got irritated when we didn't know what we were doing. When we ask for help (even if we don't ask), she shoves you aside and works on your piece. 

This includes tearing it out, using tools to scratch at the clay, smashing more clay on to whatever you were working on. In my figure drawing class, the most that teacher would do was gesture with her finger what needed to be done. That's all. Mary also has given people shit for the whole semester. 

People ask innocent questions, and she answers in a mocking way. I was sitting in a chair once, because my clay was set up on something short, and she ranted about how we shouldn't be lazy and our sculptures aren't going to be good and we aren't good artists if we aren't standing with the model. She tried to make my sculpting stand taller, but then it was too tall, so I ended up sitting the rest of the class so I could reach my piece. Now, with the added impression that I'm lazy. She then said I should have gotten there earlier so I could get a sculpting stand that worked.

Today, someone ran out of their clay. She has always said she has recycled clay, so I don't think anyone thought it would be a huge deal. After giving her a hard time, she went to check and came back saying she was out of recycled clay. She asked ""do your other art classes ask you to buy supplies?"" People said yes. ""Then it's no different here, you need to come to class prepared."" Which is fine, but the bag of clay I bought at the beginning of the semester was $20. I felt bad for the girl who had no clay now, but when I went to get my clay out I found that it had hardened in my locker over the weekend. I've seen her help someone whose clay hardened before, so I asked for her help.

She gets PISSED. She goes to say something to me, stops, then starts pacing around the room. ""Are you guys adults? Like, are you? I am DONE talking to you guys about your clay, you need to grow up and sort it out yourself. You need to go buy more clay, it's $10 at the bookstore."" I never knew it was cheaper there, but I literally have no money this week. She looks at me and tells me specifically to go buy more clay. I ask, ""right now?"" She says, ""unless you're just going to sit there all day.""

I say I literally do not have the money to go buy clay. She stops, bends over, makes a dramatic frustrated noise and paces around some more. I'm bewildered because it's not like I KNEW my clay would be hard when I came back to class. I say I'm sorry, and she comes back asking if me and the other girl can share a bag of clay. The other girl says yes, and Mary says she is going to front us the money and buy us some clay, then storms out.

I'm just sitting there, people staring at me and I can feel myself start to tear up. I usually try to be humorous in awkward situations, but when I went to speak the only thing I could say was ""great, I just had to admit to everyone that I don't have ten fucking dollars."" I started to actually cry, so I just muttered that I should just leave, and grabbed my stuff. People said not to, that she was getting more clay, that they could give me money, but that just upset me more and I didn't want Mary to come back to me sobbing. I left.

I realized I left my partner without someone to sculpt. I feel really bad, but I just didn't want to be around Mary anymore, and I didn't want to take anything from her. I would rather skip a day than owe her money. It also fucking sucks to know that I was once making good money at my last jobs, but I made the stupid decision of trying to find a non-seasonal job and now I'm fucking broke. I've been trying my hardest to keep up having a job and going to school, but I'm really struggling this semester and this didn't help.

I guess my question is now what do I do? I really don't want to face her again, and silently pretend nothing happened, but I would be wasting the entire semester so far to drop the class now. My fiancé gets paid tomorrow, so if I ask him for money he will buy me more clay, but I feel shitty already asking him to pay for my share of the bills. And I don't want to come to class with a bag of new clay, because knowing her she would call me out saying I had the money all along. This is a class that I needed to get a certificate here, and as far as I know she's the only one who teaches it. What do I do?

TLDR: Teacher calls me out in front of everyone for not having clay (even though I did, it just hardened). Tells me to buy more, I have to admit that I don't have $10. She gets pissed and asks if I'm an adult, insinuates that I'm irresponsible and says she will buy me clay and I can pay her later. I get upset and leave. What do?

&nbsp;

**Q&A**

**Are you in college or university? Do you qualify for financial aid?**

*Yeah, community college. Which I feel like, most teachers are aware that they work somewhere where the students couldn't afford to get higher education on their own, so most are sensitive about the costs of supplies. The financial aid I qualified for was just a fee waiver, so I'm supposed to buy all of my supplies on my own, but that kind of stuff is all done at the beginning of the semester. If I had known I would run out, I would have bought more when I had money, but the clay I did have just hardened. I had no idea it would happen.*

**OOP replied to a deleted downvoted comment**

*You're right, I don't have ten dollars. I do have big problems. My next paycheck is going to fixing my blinker and headlight, and rent. I need to fix my brakes on my car. I'm trying to pay for my own school, pay for bills and rent, and save up for a new apartment once our lease is up.*

*I'm looking for a better job so that once my bills are paid, I have enough to put into savings. We will have money tomorrow, and my fiancé just got a better paying job, but at this moment I do not have ten dollars. I didn't want to be like so many people I know, and stop going to school so they could work full time at a dead end retail job for min wage.*

*I'm glad you've never had the experience where you have no money after your expenses are paid, but we are out on our own with no help regarding college, my car, or my apartment. Thanks for your great advice.*

**OOP Replied to a big** [**comment**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pipnj/comment/cw6oi1q/)

*Thanks for that. I completely understand how she can get upset that people aren't coming to class with clay. It's a sculpting class, we need it. But she led everyone to believe that she had spare clay, and then got mad at us when we had none. I also HAD clay, I just wanted help using it because it was hard, I thought if I wet it down or slammed it somewhere enough it could be usable again...*

*And thanks for saying that. I have a hard time asking for help, but when it was me making more money than him, I had no problem offering to cover more of his bills so he could have some savings. If she had maybe asked when I could buy the clay, or offered to get the clay for us first thing instead of getting mad and ranting at me, I probably would have told her ""I can have clay by next class, I'm sorry I didn't know this would happen, I just can't buy it today"", but she just rolled over me and I didn't want to have to justify myself in front of everyone.*

*I live in California, in a place where the job market isn't great. My friend moved from here to Utah, was able to get jobs left and right. Cost of living was lower too. Lower pay though.*

*When she moved back here, it took her a good couple months to find anything. And it's all retail, because she hasn't gone to school. Everyone I know works retail, and is given shit pay and kept at part time so they don't have to pay benefits to them. Or vacation or sick time.*

*I had two seasonal jobs I would go back and forth from. They paid well, but they both asked for full time (and some ot) and they were only for a set amount of time. I would have a few months in between jobs, where all of my savings would go right back to living expenses. I'm looking for something part time, that pays better than min wage and doesn't require me to get up at 5am after a night class. But a lot of people know the struggle of applying for jobs :/*

*I had materials in the classroom. They were sitting there all weekend, and there must have been a hole in the bag or I must not have twisted the bag tight enough when I put it in my locker. My mistake, I completely understand if she were to get frustrated and tell me that if my materials are unusable, then I won't get a participation grade for the day. But she threw a fit when I asked for her help in making the clay work. She didn't have to do it for me, she didn't have to lecture the whole class on how to do it. The rest of the students were beginning to work on the assignment, and she was not lecturing, so the only think I would take her away from is walking around the class or working on her own sculpture.*

*I didn't have to say to the class that I am broke. I wrote the gist of the conversation, but when I said I couldn't afford to buy the clay, she asked me ""you don't have $10 to buy clay?"" I said no, I'm sorry, and she put her hands on her knees and made a huge huffing noise before saying anything else to me. Like it angered her that I don't have $10. If I had mentioned to any of my classmates, ""oh I don't even have $10 to buy coffee and a snack, sucks being a poor college student, huh?"" I wouldn't care. I'm joking about it. But to have it drug out like it was? It was humiliating.*

**OOP Replied to a big** [**thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pipnj/comment/cw6r4sr/)

*When she showed the student how to restore their clay, it was during model time. The nude model was up on the stand, everyone in the classroom was sculpting, including me. I saw her tossing the clay on the ground, messing with it, but I was trying to get my assignment done so I wasn't paying that much attention to her. She didn't stop the model's pose to tell us what she was doing.*

*I didn't want to keep any of my pieces because I hated them. I'm a figure drawing artist, I will keep some of my drawings, but if I don't think it looks good, I won't keep it. I'll throw it away. I didn't want to invest time painting, waxing, sanding a sculpture that I didn't like in the first place. It's an intro class, I'm not trying to become a sculptor.*

*I didn't ask that she take time to help me restore the clay. The assignment was starting, all of the other students were beginning to sculpt their partners and she was done with her demo. I wasn't taking any time out of anyone's day, or taking her from the class. The only person I inconvenienced was my partner, but if Mary was willing, I would have just modeled for him this class period and then when I came back with good clay, I would sculpt him for another class period.*

*I could manage getting more clay, if that meant restoring my hard clay, or waiting a day before my fiance got paid. I don't know if you've ever been in between paychecks to this extent, but occasionally it happens. Unexpected costs happen.*

# **Final Update - 2 days later**

^(October 22, 2015)

[**[UPDATE] Teacher [40sF] called me[19F] out in front of the class, asking if I am an adult and making me admit I don't have $10 to spend on school supplies**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3po6ug/update_teacher_40sf_called_me19f_out_in_front_of/)

Okay. I had no idea so many people would care so much about clay, I thought I would get like two comments. This really blew up. Thank you to everyone who commented, to all the people who told me how the process works, and for all of the general tips regarding clay, student financial aid, and general finances. A lot of people took time to read my stupid ramblings and type up a reply. I'm grateful.

I also want to thank every single one of you who offered to buy me clay. You are all the kindest, most generous people ever. I just wouldn't feel right taking money to buy clay, when I don't even enjoy the medium. I also will go into more details below, but I'm not going to be taking the class anymore.

To all of you who agreed with Mary and said that I'm not an adult because:

1. I don't have $10

2. I wasn't prepared coming to class (Gosh, if only I was psychic and knew my clay hardened)

3. I cried when someone yelled at me for not having money

4. I'm lying about not having any money, and I just wanted to be a bitch to my teacher

I would like to say that I'm glad none of you has ever been in this situation before. I put it clearly in my post (and my replies) that I didn't have $10 that day. I have money now! Fiance got paid, we're fluuuuuuuuuush with cash! I mean not really, but still. We're good! If I wanted to buy a shit ton of clay right now, I could. It just so happened that I ran out of money after paying the bills in the middle of the month, and I didn't see how it was a big deal because I wasn't expecting any purchases. 

It was probably a period of 3 or 4 days where I was OUT of money, and at that point it's easy to just hold out until one of us gets paid. I have an apartment, a computer, my bills are paid and I have food. I would say I am adulting, just by definition. For everyone telling me I need to sort that out, I AM. FFS I AM. Fiance got a better job, I'm looking for a better job. I KNOW I'M NOT IN THE BEST SITUATION, I'M WORKING TO FIX IT. JEEZ.

For the clay, I stored it in my locker the entire semester with no problems so far. The outside would maybe be a little stiff, but being new to clay (at least, new to fancy high-fire sculpting clay), I thought it was normal. I would just spray it and squish it until it was manageable. This was the first time the entire block felt like a rock, and I couldn't move much of the clay. 

I didn't know what the procedure was here, so to all of you saying that it's easy to google and find out, guess who doesn't like phones in her class? Also, why would I google it when I have a supposed clay expert two feet from me? I picked up my bag, felt the clay, and asked Mary for help because my clay was hard. That was it. I didn't say, ""Mary. My clay is ruined. Get me new clay or I'm not participating in your stupid class."" 

I also wasn't taking her away from her lesson, because she had just finished demonstrating something. People were picking up their clay and getting started on the assignment, so I wasn't taking her away from my other classmates and I certainly wasn't disturbing anyone. According to many of the ceramicists(?) here on reddit, hard clay is an easy fix. She could have showed me how to fix the clay. 

She could have TOLD me how to fix the clay, and left me to do it on my own. She could have told me that without clay, I can't participate and my grade will be docked. She could have simply said, ""Can you go get more clay?"" And I would have probably said ""Not today, but if you want I can model for my partner today and I'll have clay on Thursday.""

So on to the update. I spoke to my other trusted teacher, who happens to be the chair of my major's department. I came up to him and said, ""I know it's not YOUR department, but as a department chair, I was wondering if I could get your advice. It's about a teacher."" And he just gestured me outside to where we could talk. 

At first I tried to be vague, and not single out who the teacher was since it's not his department, but I was struggling with what I was trying to say. He asked me to tell him who it was and what happened, so I did. I teared up a little bit, felt stupid, but he totally validated my feelings. He said she was unprofessional and classless, that she should NOT have done what she did. 

He said I confirmed what he already thought of the teacher. He also told me (he used to go to school for ceramics) that she is not even using the right clay for figure sculpture. She's using ceramics clay, and it isn't necessary or easy when it comes to sculpting people.

I asked what I should do, because it's his certificate I'm taking the class for. He told me we would find some other alternative for those credits, or I could wait it out until the department takes the class from her and gives it to someone who deserves it. He advised that I should drop the class, because as a teacher, you start to be in danger when your enrollment drops. You get looked at, you get questioned, evaluated. He basically said, fuck her. 

If she's going to be that unstable and treat me like that, she doesn't deserve to have me in her classroom. She thinks she's teaching us some big life lesson when she gets mad about a late student, or when she yells at us about having hard clay, but she forgets where she is. A community college. We're there to learn, to try and better ourselves, and we're doing it despite being in a worse-off financial position. I shouldn't let someone like her discourage me from getting a certificate or a degree. 

So I asked if a complaint would make any sort of difference, and he just said it wouldn't. Unless there are a thousand complaints, then nothing will be done. Her file will be flagged, but unless it's a pattern, then she won't be fired. Being new to the class, however, might get through enough to where they take the class from her. He also told me that if he hears any other student having problems with her class like this, he will take it off of his certificate and replace it with something else. This would hurt her, because over half of those students were in there because of the same certificate I was.

When I got home, I got an email from her. It said:

	Teacherthrowaway1313

	I am so sorry if I embarrassed you in front of the class. 
	
	Please accept my apology

Heartfelt, right?

So basically I'm writing a letter to the dean and dropping the class. I know a lot of you said how it would be cowardly of me, how I should walk back in with my head held high, and pretend that she can't hurt me, but this was the final straw. I was not learning anything from her class. When it started, I was really excited to learn how to work in clay and how to make little sculptures, to learn about more sculptors and their techniques, and none of that has happened. 

The only reason I was there was a certificate, and if I don't have to go back, I don't want to waste my time on her. I can spend my time focusing on my other classes and looking for a better job ;) I've been working on standing up for myself more (my roommate's friends wanted to crash on my couch for a few days, which of course turned into wanting to stay for a few months, and I shut that down before he was even done talking. Set boundaries, set expectations. 

Felt like a bitch, but a boss ass bitch). You win some, you lose some. Next time someone starts to yell in my face, hopefully I won't turn red and stutter apologies. Let them know it's not okay to talk to me like that, and give them a chance to correct themselves. But this time, I feel better just leaving it behind me. Thanks for your help, r/relationships, you guys are cool :)

TLDR: Writing a letter to the dean, dropping the class. Finding alternative credits for my certificate, don't have to deal with Ms. Crazypants anymore. Also, am now flush with cash.

XR vs AR

The simplest way to think about it is this: **One is a giant private monitor, and the other is a computer that actively interacts with the room you're in.**



# Rayneo Air 3S Pro (The Portable Cinema / XR Glasses)



Think of the 3S Pro as the ultimate screen replacement. When you plug it into your phone, laptop, or game console, it gives you a massive, super bright virtual screen, like having a 200-inch TV floating right in front of your face. It's built for immersion and privacy. The important thing to know is that this ""screen"" is fixed to your head—it moves when you move, just like taping a tablet to your forehead. This is the perfect gear for watching movies on a flight, getting a huge private monitor for focused work at a coffee shop, or gaming on the go. It’s all about seeing your digital content in a bigger, better way.



# Rayneo X3 (The Contextual Assistant / True AR Glasses)



The X3 is a completely different beast. It’s not just projecting a screen; it’s using cameras and sensors to literally map and understand your environment—your desk, your living room, the street outside. This is what allows digital objects to be **anchored in real space.** If you put a virtual TV on your real wall, it stays there even if you walk away and come back. This is built for blending the digital world *into* the real world—think navigation arrows floating on the pavement, real-time translations of signs, or placing a 3D model right on your actual workbench. The X3 is a spatial computer built to augment reality itself.



# TL;DR - Pick Based on Your Goal (Work & Relaxing)



To keep it simple, here’s a quick breakdown of what the different concepts are best for:

||
||
|**If you want to...**|**Choose the Rayneo Air 3S Pro (XR)**|**Choose the Rayneo X3 (True AR)**|
|**📺 Relaxing: Watch movies/stream TV on a plane/couch**|**✅ Yes** (Portable Cinema)|**❌ No** (Overkill/Not optimized for simple viewing)|
|**💻 Work: Get a huge, private secondary monitor for your laptop**|**✅ Yes** (Display focused, plug and play)|**❌ No** (Overkill for a simple screen mirror)|
|**📍 Work: See real-time translations of foreign text/signs**|**❌ No** (No environment awareness/AI)|**✅ Yes** (Contextual AI & Camera needed)|
|**🎮 Relaxing: Play console/mobile games on a massive screen**|**✅ Yes** (Immersive, high-quality display)|**❌ No** (Features are wasted on screen mirroring)|
|**📐 Work: Anchor a 3D model or design visualization on your desk**|**❌ No** (Screen is fixed to your head)|**✅ Yes** (Uses spatial mapping to pin objects)|
|**🚶 Relaxing: Get contextual directions overlaid onto the street**|**❌ No** (No spatial awareness)|**✅ Yes** (True AR for navigation)|

Ultimately, the **Air 3S Pro** is for entertainment and productivity **display**. The **X3** is for interaction, computing, and merging digital objects **into** your physical world.

It’s not just about how much work you have. It’s about how your brain is experiencing time. A lot of my peers say the same: they want to do more, but they can't bear working longer without hitting burnout. And yeah, the sea of productivity tips online, batching, habit stacking, Pomodoro, gets exhausting real fast. Most of it feels gimmicky or optimized for content, not for real humans with real brains.

That’s why I dug deeper into what top neuroscientists, authors, and behavioral researchers know about time perception and how it affects productivity. This post is a breakdown of the best real-world, psychology-backed strategies to stretch your work output without wrecking your brain. Some of these tricks are genuinely shocking, and they don’t come from hustle bros who meditate only to be more efficient at crushing emails. These are tools to actually feel better doing more, not just doing more.

**Your brain doesn’t track time like a stopwatch. It tracks change.** Neuroscientist David Eagleman explains in his book *Livewired* that time feels “slow” or “fast” based on how many novel experiences we undergo, not how many minutes pass. That’s why vacations seem longer in memory, new sounds, smells, routines, and why endless scrolling or meetings feel like they evaporate into nothingness. So one way you can hack your perception of time is by engineering deliberate mini-novelties in your workday. Change locations. Use different music genres per task. Even switching up your lighting or what tab layout you use can help your brain feel more engaged and present.

**Chunking time into rituals makes long hours feel more structured and tolerable.** Clinical psychologist Dr. Laurie Santos, host of *The Happiness Lab*, points out that repetitive but meaningful rituals (like post-lunch walks, start-of-day journaling) help create temporal landmarks, which makes time feel more intentional instead of blobby. I started splitting my day into 2-hour “scenes” like it’s a movie schedule, with each block having its own vibe: focus music + coffee, then walking calls, then low-pressure admin stuff. It’s wild how this simple structure makes a 10-hour workday feel like four separate, manageable sprints.

**Dopamine isn’t just about pleasure, it’s about anticipation.** Dr. Anna Lembke, author of *Dopamine Nation*, says our brain is wired to chase reward, not just receive it. Small, clear goals—like finishing a slide deck or replying to 10 emails, can flood your system with dopamine if you build in tiny moments of anticipation. I attach little “treats” to each milestone, not just snacks but even rewatching 4 minutes of my favorite YouTube essayist or walking outside barefoot. When these are pre-decided, they become part of the reward loop instead of just distractions.

**Overstimulation makes time disintegrate into noise.** A study published by the Journal of Neuroscience in 2021 found that constant context-switching impairs the brain’s temporal memory formation, aka, you're less likely to remember what you did and the day feels like nothing. This is why deep focus blocks feel slower but more satisfying in hindsight. I use heavy blockers like Cold Turkey for deep tasks, but even low-friction tricks help: full-screen mode, hiding the clock from my screen, and putting my phone in silent grayscale.

**Reduce friction between intention and action.** James Clear talks about this a lot in *Atomic Habits*, which is still one of the most useful behavior books ever. If you want to work longer without hating it, you have to make starting feel effortless. Pre-set your workspace. Write a low-effort “first step” sentence before logging off. For me, it’s about leaving small cues, like a tab open to the doc I need to write tomorrow, or my headphones draped over my chair ready to go.

Now for the part that actually made this stick for me: using the right resources to reinforce these ideas and make them part of my muscle memory instead of just good intentions. These are the tools and sources that helped me not only learn this stuff, but make it second nature.

**Book rec: *The Extended Mind* by Annie Murphy Paul.** This book blew my mind. It argues that the brain performs best when you think outside of it, using physical movement, environment, even social connection as extensions of cognition. It’s an insanely good read with strong research and one of those books that makes you question how we were ever taught to work in rigid, desk-bound silos. Annie is a science journalist who’s contributed to *Scientific American* and *The New York Times*, and won multiple awards. After I read it, I changed how I designed my “focus zones” and even how I use my body when thinking through hard problems. This is the best neuroscience-meets-doing-the-thing book I’ve ever read.

**Podcast: *Huberman Lab* - Episode on Time Perception.** Dr. Andrew Huberman’s breakdown of how light, dopamine, and even posture affect your sense of time is stupid valuable. His deep dives are dense but always packed with actionable stuff. He also covers how tools like ultradian rhythms (90-min focus-rest cycles) help your brain sustain long-term effort without feeling drained.

**YouTube Channel: Ali Abdaal’s “Deep Dive” productivity interviews.** His chat with Cal Newport (author of *Deep Work*) really challenged how I viewed focus and time. It’s less about “grinding” for 10 hours, more about crafting 2 solid hours that feel sacred. The episode on monotasking vs. time-blocking was especially useful for making extended work sessions feel less like punishment.

**App: Endel.** I use Endel for real-time personalized background sound. They use neuroscience principles to generate audio based on your circadian rhythm, heart rate, and weather. I use their ""Focus"" and ""Deep Work"" soundscapes the most, especially when transitioning into a long session where I’d normally hit mental fatigue. It makes it easier to sit down and actually stay present, especially when paired with anti-distraction tabs.

**App: BeFreed.** This one’s my new fav for replacing random scrolling time during breaks. I use it when walking around between deep work blocks or during gym warmups. I just tell it what I’m trying to improve, like time management habits or how to stop procrastinating, and it crafts insanely smart podcast-style audio from legit sources like expert interviews and top nonfiction books. What impresses me is how the episodes actually adapt the deeper I go on the topic, based on follow-up questions I ask during playback. I don’t even need to type. And yeah, I fully changed the podcast host’s voice to one that hypes me up in the afternoon slump. Makes passive learning actually addictive.

There’s no way to brute-force your way into loving long work sessions. But you can absolutely shift how your brain frames time, reward, and novelty. Learning this stuff didn’t just make me “better at productivity,” it stopped me from resenting the hours I actually need to build things that matter.

Overheard my aunt and her husband too discussing about putting me in therapy but her husband is very firm about not affording it and I don’t know if I’m also ready to seek professional help yet.

I’m currently living with my aunt and 2 cousins. Living situation is not the best but it was a LOT better than being verbally and physically abused.

And to anyone that would make fun about my “hairy thigh”, its on my genes and I’m not gonna shave it because people made fun of it. Also, how do ask my aunt for stuff without sounding like im being materialistic? Ive found a part time job and would need a bus pass. I also don’t have a lot of clothes so I want to ask her for a jacket since I’ve been borrowing her husband’s everytime I go out and its literally twice my size.

1p7b81s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/1p7b81s/random_allergies_living_my_nightmare/,Random Allergies - living my nightmare,"**Hello everyone!**  
Since the summer I’ve been struggling with a very strange illness, and so far the doctors haven’t been able to give me any concrete answers. The **papillae** on my tongue swell up, my throat swells, I feel tightness behind my uvula, a foreign-body or “**bone-like**” sensation, pressure. Sometimes it’s better, sometimes worse, it fluctuates completely, and my tongue looks like a map. Since September I’ve been on a reflux- and histamine-free diet, but my symptoms are not improving.  
I’ll describe what has happened to me.  
*What do you think this could be? What would you recommend? The throat pain and tightness are making my everyday life very difficult, and I’m living in constant fear.*

**Background**

I hadn’t really been ill for about two years. But this May I had an upper respiratory infection, followed a few weeks later by severe lower abdominal pain. One doctor thought it was a cyst, another suspected a bowel issue, and another a urinary tract infection. It resolved within a week and a half. Before that I saw a gynecologist, who found everything normal. They wanted to treat me for a UTI, but my mother suspected that the thick mucus produced during my sinusitis had drained down my throat into my stomach. I was given Azi Sandoz.  
After that I began developing eczematous symptoms, mostly around the outer lower lip area and the armpits. Also, two years ago I had nasal surgery to correct a deviated septum.

**Onset of symptoms**

My symptoms began on **08 June**. That day I was visiting a friend, we talked, had coffee, and a few hours later I drank Coke and developed very strong neck spasms. I felt a “bone floating” sensation in my throat, tightness, pressure on the laryngeal cartilage, and needle-like pains around my tonsils, as if I had swallowed a needle. The lymph nodes under my jaw swelled, the thyroid area hurt, and I had pain at the base of my throat near the collarbone. It lasted for hours. At the ER they found nothing; they examined me with an **endoscope** and looked into my throat.  
A few days later I got better and could eat everything, but on the day of the symptoms I only had some onion cream soup and Alpro soy yogurt. I also noticed a small red spot inside my cheek that disappeared the next day, as if a vessel had burst.

About two weeks later I went to the ER again. At work I had coffee (I usually drink it with almond milk), the AC was blowing strongly, and a colleague next to me was cleaning with a spray called Pronto. Immediately I felt throat tightness and pressure, my voice became hoarse, I couldn’t swallow, as if even water would get stuck. At the hospital they suspected reflux but didn’t call it an allergic reaction. I was given Suprastin through IV.  
At home I tried eating a reflux-friendly diet, but the symptoms kept coming back (even when I wasn’t eating—for example I felt the same tightness sitting in the air-conditioned train).  
**I noticed reactions to certain foods**: Jogobella lactose-free peach yogurt, chocolate, ice cream, and coffee caused immediate symptoms. I cut them out.  
One day I took Suprastin and then felt strong throat burning for three hours, couldn’t eat, and became very sleepy. A nurse we know advised me to stop taking it; instead I tried Calcimusc, but it didn’t help.  
I went back to work...  
I had a water bottle I used at university. Inside its rubber straw I noticed tiny black marker-like dots—someone said it was **mold**, so I threw it out immediately.  
One day I ate a Döner kebab with no issues. Later that week I ate grapes during the day and bought gyros and grape juice from the same kebab place for dinner. By evening my tongue itched, the **lymph nodes in my throat swelled**, the tightness and painful swallowing came back, and my **neck hurt.**  
Not long after, on a Thursday, I tried making pastelli at home with flower honey and sesame seeds. My tongue became blistered and itchy, so my parents took me to the ER in an other city. The doctor said my tongue looked completely normal.  
I continued the **reflux diet a**nd took medications (Noacid, Gaviscon, Salvus water therapy).  
Coffee still tightened my throat, so I cut it out entirely. I tried mate tea and matcha instead. Matcha was fine for a few days, then it also caused throat tightness, though milder. Banana caused slight itching on my tongue.  
I can feel myself getting very weak, I’ve unfortunately lost weight, and eating is becoming increasingly difficult.

**Around July 30**, on a Thursday, I ate a tortilla wrap with organic yogurt, cucumber, plain chicken, and lactose-free cheese. I started itching, so I ate a yogurt (Alpro blueberry soy yogurt). I had eaten it before with no issue, but this time my tongue swelled completely, went numb, and developed a **rock-hard lump that was palpable**. I took probiotics, fermented carrot, Fenistil drops, and lemon balm tea. It took hours for the swelling to go down; the lump disappeared after an hour. But I had chills all evening.  
On Friday and Saturday I kept feeling cold, was sleepy, and could barely eat. By Sunday I was better, but the throat tightness and laryngeal pressure returned.  
After that I felt sharp, follicle-like pain in my **tonsils**. I took Flector, but the pain continued. It radiated toward the corners of my mouth where the **eczema** had previously appeared, as if the pain traveled from my tongue. I felt intense itching. On the left side, near the lymph nodes, my throat felt like something was poking my tonsil and ear.  
On Tuesday I went to my GP, who said I had mouth **ulcers** and gave me Anaftin spray. A week later I improved.  
In the summer I noticed that heat made my throat tighten more. After meals it was sensitive, but sometimes it happened without food.  
I also noticed that when reactions occurred—or as they were fading—my skin on my throat and chin often itched. Red, itchy patches appeared.

**Later events**

On 29 August I took an iron + folic acid tablet.  
Immediately after swallowing it my tongue began to swell (like in the yogurt incident), rock-hard lumps appeared, it reddened, and the tongue glands elongated like **stringy coral** when touched. I took Fenistil drops and went to the ER, where—since I reacted badly to both Suprastin and Revicet—they gave me a magnesium solution intravenously. The itching stopped, but my throat remained sensitive, with stabbing sensations at times around the thyroid area.  
My tongue stayed sensitive and blistered, so the next day I could only eat porridge.  
Two days later, around 5 p.m., I developed strong neck spasms again. I couldn’t swallow, even water wouldn’t go down, and I felt dizzy. My parents took me to a big city, where ENT examinations were normal.  
The doctor suspected histamine intolerance and reflux. I was given pantoprazole via infusion; halfway through I could drink again.  
The next day I could again only eat porridge. I felt better, but at 4 a.m. (on 01 September) I woke up with chest pain. I ate a little. My head felt foggy, my chest felt empty and pressured, and I couldn’t fall back asleep for a long time. I was belching (presumably from reflux). I couldn’t lie down. When I woke up again later, I felt blisters behind my uvula and on my palate, plus stinging in my throat.  
On 01 September afternoon I had diarrhea. Lower stomach and bowel pain began, easing after meals.  
My thyroid area felt swollen and tender, like having follicles.  
After this, with the help of a dietitian, I started a strict histamine-free diet, which I still follow.  
My symptoms improved while taking Zyrtec, but pressure and stabbing around the laryngeal cartilage/thyroid area persist, as if the bone itself hurts. Sometimes my tonsils feel follicular. Sometimes my throat stiffens and slightly enlarges, then suddenly returns to normal—this happens with temperature changes. Because of the cold weather we had to turn on the AC for heating, and when it blew strongly, my throat tightened and I had to go outside into the cold air to feel better.  
This period also brought strong headaches, especially since mid-September. Constant fatigue, as if my body cannot rest.  
Sometimes I react to certain foods, other times not. This happened with grated apple mixed with cane sugar and cinnamon (Ceylon), shredded coconut, and blueberries. Chicken breast causes no symptoms, but slightly tougher chicken thigh made my **tongue sensitive.**  
2025.10.23 — In the evening, after eating oatmeal (which previously caused no symptoms), the back of my tongue near the tonsils became painful, sharp, scratchy, and the lymph nodes on both sides were sore.

Additionally, water started to drip from my nose inexplicably when I bent down — twice. It wasn’t blood or mucus, **just clear water.**

**Other information**

Thyroid ultrasound was normal. Tryptase and cortisol tests were done.  
I had stool and microbiome tests, which showed **Leaky Gut syndrome** — I am currently receiving treatment for this.  
In October I had no foreign-body sensation, but around 06 November it returned.  
**MCAS** is suspected as a complication; I’m taking quercetin for it.  
A hematologist suspected Crohn’s disease, but my stools and appetite are normal. Weight loss happened due to throat pain and mouth ulcers.  
Since June I sometimes have thick mucus draining backward from my throat that doesn’t exit through my nose. It drips backward, making me clear my throat and cough. Yesterday in the heat I had very strong drainage and had to cough repeatedly.  
Nasal and oral swab tests were negative.  
My ENT says my nasal mucosa is swollen, but suspects a dental rather than ENT origin. I got my wisdom teeth removed afterwards.

**Childhood history**

As a child (10 years ago) I had very similar symptoms. They investigated for a long time; initially they said it was psychological, but eventually they discovered an egg allergy and reflux. I improved once I removed egg from my diet and received reflux treatment.  
I was symptom-free for 10 years, though on two occasions, when I accidentally ingested a tiny amount of egg, I was unwell for days.  
I also have known lactose intolerance.  
In childhood I took many antibiotics and often had sinus infections. Later I had mild bronchitis, which resolved after treatment.

Learning these things can dramatically improve your cat's quality of life and your relationship with them.

​Here are 10 life-changing pieces of advice every cat owner should know:

​The 10 Essential Cat Knowledge Bombs

​1. The Right Way to Do Introductions
​The old wisdom of ""they'll work it out"" is incredibly risky. Never let animals sort out their own issues. If you have a dog, they need a reliable down stay before meeting the cat. The first chase can permanently destroy the cat's confidence. Always use a slow, step-by-step introduction process.

​2. Separate Food, Water, and Litter Resources
​It's crucial to protect your cat's resources. Dogs often see the litter box as a snack, which is unsafe for your cat. Use a baby gate with clearance underneath so the cat can slip through to their litter box, but the dog cannot. Similarly, feed the cat off the ground and separately to prevent resource guarding issues from either side.

​3. Trim Those Nails Regularly
​You must trim your cat's nails every 3 to 4 weeks, tops. This is not just for your furniture or skin; it prevents the claws from growing too long and curving under to dig into the pads of their own paws, which is very painful for the cat.

​4. Optimum Nutrition is Key
​A cat is an obligate carnivore and needs a meat-based diet. Crucially, they get the majority of their hydration through their food. Dry food is often lacking in moisture and can lead to health issues like diabetes and kidney problems later in life. Be your cat's best advocate—do your due diligence on their nutrition.

​5. They Need Daily Enrichment and Catification
​Cats are not low-maintenance; they just don't protest as loudly as dogs. They require daily play and catification (environmental enrichment). Cats build their confidence and ""Mojo"" by being able to explore every square inch of space, especially vertical space.

​6. Cat-Proof Your House
​Think of a cat as a toddler who can reach the ceiling. You need to cat-proof your house to prevent accidents.
​Put child blocks on everything.
​Block off the ""unders"" (under beds, coffee tables, etc.). If there’s an emergency and they hide in a spot you can’t reach, you'll be stuck.

​7. Research Vets and Pet Sitters Now
​Don't wait until an emergency to find a vet. Don't choose a professional purely based on convenience. Solicit opinions from friends and family, and research them thoroughly. The same goes for pet sitters—make sure you have someone who is bonded and insured that you can trust to enter your home if you're called out of town.

​8. Get Pet Insurance
​Pet insurance is a necessary investment. Emergencies happen, and if you’re not prepared, the bills can be extremely high. Shop around, as different plans have different premiums, deductibles, and coverage.

​9. Create an Emergency Plan
​Have a fire drill and a go bag with essentials. An emergency plan means you rely on a game plan instead of adrenaline. A huge part of this is getting your cat used to the carrier. Make the carrier their safe place so they don't panic the second they see it.

​10. Understand ""Cat with a Capital C""
​Learn about the history and evolution of cats.

1p7b70m,https://i.redd.it/emok6kcthm3g1.jpeg,Pierre Poilievre: The King of “It’s Everyone Else’s Fault”,"Every time something goes wrong in Canada, Pierre Poilievre looks around like a guy who just tripped over his own shoelaces and says —

👉 “Who did this?!”

Housing crisis? Trudeau’s fault.

Climate disasters? The carbon tax.

Economic turbulence? Mark Carney, obviously.

Reality? CBC’s fault.

The man could spill his coffee and blame the barista, the beans, and the Bank of Canada in one breath.

Poilievre has made an art of wrecking things and then pretending he’s the only one who can fix them. He’s voted against affordable housing, blocked climate action, and fueled disinformation — then turned around and said “See? Everything’s broken!”

Now, his latest crusade is against the CBC, because truth-telling ruins the show. CBC journalists keep doing the one thing his team can’t stand: fact-checking.

Let’s be real — “defund the CBC” isn’t about saving money. It’s about turning down the volume on reality. Because when the facts don’t fit the narrative, the narrative gets louder.

As Michael de Adder’s brilliant cartoon reminds us — sometimes the wounds are self-inflicted. Poilievre just doesn’t like being reminded of that part.

Support truth. Support accountability. Support CBC.

There really wasn’t any turbulence until we got below 6,000 feet under the clouds (clouds are really low today here). There was turbulence for the last 5ish minutes but it was not the big drop feeling kind!! That’s the kind I really hate. It was more like as if the wind was just moving the plane side to side and the occasional up and down but no big drops! It was actually super fine and the only reason I was tense was because i was waiting for a big drop feeling but it never came! I had never experienced the side to side swaying kind of turbulence until now but I’m really glad I did because it wasn’t bad at all and now I know what it feels like and I can do it!! I just asked my husband what he thought of the landing and he smiled real big and said “it was fun!” 😂 honestly I can almost agree with him.

1p7b40x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1p7b40x/could_be_mcas_throat_issues_or_else/,could be MCAS - Throat issues or else?,"**Hello everyone!**  
Since the summer I’ve been struggling with a very strange illness, and so far the doctors haven’t been able to give me any concrete answers. The **papillae** on my tongue swell up, my throat swells, I feel tightness behind my uvula, a foreign-body or “**bone-like**” sensation, pressure. Sometimes it’s better, sometimes worse, it fluctuates completely, and my tongue looks like a map. Since September I’ve been on a reflux- and histamine-free diet, but my symptoms are not improving.  
I’ll describe what has happened to me.  
*What do you think this could be? What would you recommend? The throat pain and tightness are making my everyday life very difficult, and I’m living in constant fear.*

**Background**

I hadn’t really been ill for about two years. But this May I had an upper respiratory infection, followed a few weeks later by severe lower abdominal pain. One doctor thought it was a cyst, another suspected a bowel issue, and another a urinary tract infection. It resolved within a week and a half. Before that I saw a gynecologist, who found everything normal. They wanted to treat me for a UTI, but my mother suspected that the thick mucus produced during my sinusitis had drained down my throat into my stomach. I was given Azi Sandoz.  
After that I began developing eczematous symptoms, mostly around the outer lower lip area and the armpits. Also, two years ago I had nasal surgery to correct a deviated septum.

**Onset of symptoms**

My symptoms began on **08 June**. That day I was visiting a friend, we talked, had coffee, and a few hours later I drank Coke and developed very strong neck spasms. I felt a “bone floating” sensation in my throat, tightness, pressure on the laryngeal cartilage, and needle-like pains around my tonsils, as if I had swallowed a needle. The lymph nodes under my jaw swelled, the thyroid area hurt, and I had pain at the base of my throat near the collarbone. It lasted for hours. At the ER they found nothing; they examined me with an **endoscope** and looked into my throat.  
A few days later I got better and could eat everything, but on the day of the symptoms I only had some onion cream soup and Alpro soy yogurt. I also noticed a small red spot inside my cheek that disappeared the next day, as if a vessel had burst.

About two weeks later I went to the ER again. At work I had coffee (I usually drink it with almond milk), the AC was blowing strongly, and a colleague next to me was cleaning with a spray called Pronto. Immediately I felt throat tightness and pressure, my voice became hoarse, I couldn’t swallow, as if even water would get stuck. At the hospital they suspected reflux but didn’t call it an allergic reaction. I was given Suprastin through IV.  
At home I tried eating a reflux-friendly diet, but the symptoms kept coming back (even when I wasn’t eating—for example I felt the same tightness sitting in the air-conditioned train).  
**I noticed reactions to certain foods**: Jogobella lactose-free peach yogurt, chocolate, ice cream, and coffee caused immediate symptoms. I cut them out.  
One day I took Suprastin and then felt strong throat burning for three hours, couldn’t eat, and became very sleepy. A nurse we know advised me to stop taking it; instead I tried Calcimusc, but it didn’t help.  
I went back to work...  
I had a water bottle I used at university. Inside its rubber straw I noticed tiny black marker-like dots—someone said it was **mold**, so I threw it out immediately.  
One day I ate a Döner kebab with no issues. Later that week I ate grapes during the day and bought gyros and grape juice from the same kebab place for dinner. By evening my tongue itched, the **lymph nodes in my throat swelled**, the tightness and painful swallowing came back, and my **neck hurt.**  
Not long after, on a Thursday, I tried making pastelli at home with flower honey and sesame seeds. My tongue became blistered and itchy, so my parents took me to the ER in an other city. The doctor said my tongue looked completely normal.  
I continued the **reflux diet a**nd took medications (Noacid, Gaviscon, Salvus water therapy).  
Coffee still tightened my throat, so I cut it out entirely. I tried mate tea and matcha instead. Matcha was fine for a few days, then it also caused throat tightness, though milder. Banana caused slight itching on my tongue.  
I can feel myself getting very weak, I’ve unfortunately lost weight, and eating is becoming increasingly difficult.

**Around July 30**, on a Thursday, I ate a tortilla wrap with organic yogurt, cucumber, plain chicken, and lactose-free cheese. I started itching, so I ate a yogurt (Alpro blueberry soy yogurt). I had eaten it before with no issue, but this time my tongue swelled completely, went numb, and developed a **rock-hard lump that was palpable**. I took probiotics, fermented carrot, Fenistil drops, and lemon balm tea. It took hours for the swelling to go down; the lump disappeared after an hour. But I had chills all evening.  
On Friday and Saturday I kept feeling cold, was sleepy, and could barely eat. By Sunday I was better, but the throat tightness and laryngeal pressure returned.  
After that I felt sharp, follicle-like pain in my **tonsils**. I took Flector, but the pain continued. It radiated toward the corners of my mouth where the **eczema** had previously appeared, as if the pain traveled from my tongue. I felt intense itching. On the left side, near the lymph nodes, my throat felt like something was poking my tonsil and ear.  
On Tuesday I went to my GP, who said I had mouth **ulcers** and gave me Anaftin spray. A week later I improved.  
In the summer I noticed that heat made my throat tighten more. After meals it was sensitive, but sometimes it happened without food.  
I also noticed that when reactions occurred—or as they were fading—my skin on my throat and chin often itched. Red, itchy patches appeared.

**Later events**

On 29 August I took an iron + folic acid tablet.  
Immediately after swallowing it my tongue began to swell (like in the yogurt incident), rock-hard lumps appeared, it reddened, and the tongue glands elongated like **stringy coral** when touched. I took Fenistil drops and went to the ER, where—since I reacted badly to both Suprastin and Revicet—they gave me a magnesium solution intravenously. The itching stopped, but my throat remained sensitive, with stabbing sensations at times around the thyroid area.  
My tongue stayed sensitive and blistered, so the next day I could only eat porridge.  
Two days later, around 5 p.m., I developed strong neck spasms again. I couldn’t swallow, even water wouldn’t go down, and I felt dizzy. My parents took me to a big city, where ENT examinations were normal.  
The doctor suspected histamine intolerance and reflux. I was given pantoprazole via infusion; halfway through I could drink again.  
The next day I could again only eat porridge. I felt better, but at 4 a.m. (on 01 September) I woke up with chest pain. I ate a little. My head felt foggy, my chest felt empty and pressured, and I couldn’t fall back asleep for a long time. I was belching (presumably from reflux). I couldn’t lie down. When I woke up again later, I felt blisters behind my uvula and on my palate, plus stinging in my throat.  
On 01 September afternoon I had diarrhea. Lower stomach and bowel pain began, easing after meals.  
My thyroid area felt swollen and tender, like having follicles.  
After this, with the help of a dietitian, I started a strict histamine-free diet, which I still follow.  
My symptoms improved while taking Zyrtec, but pressure and stabbing around the laryngeal cartilage/thyroid area persist, as if the bone itself hurts. Sometimes my tonsils feel follicular. Sometimes my throat stiffens and slightly enlarges, then suddenly returns to normal—this happens with temperature changes. Because of the cold weather we had to turn on the AC for heating, and when it blew strongly, my throat tightened and I had to go outside into the cold air to feel better.  
This period also brought strong headaches, especially since mid-September. Constant fatigue, as if my body cannot rest.  
Sometimes I react to certain foods, other times not. This happened with grated apple mixed with cane sugar and cinnamon (Ceylon), shredded coconut, and blueberries. Chicken breast causes no symptoms, but slightly tougher chicken thigh made my **tongue sensitive.**  
2025.10.23 — In the evening, after eating oatmeal (which previously caused no symptoms), the back of my tongue near the tonsils became painful, sharp, scratchy, and the lymph nodes on both sides were sore.

Additionally, water started to drip from my nose inexplicably when I bent down — twice. It wasn’t blood or mucus, **just clear water.**

**Other information**

Thyroid ultrasound was normal. Tryptase and cortisol tests were done.  
I had stool and microbiome tests, which showed **Leaky Gut syndrome** — I am currently receiving treatment for this.  
In October I had no foreign-body sensation, but around 06 November it returned.  
**MCAS** is suspected as a complication; I’m taking quercetin for it.  
A hematologist suspected Crohn’s disease, but my stools and appetite are normal. Weight loss happened due to throat pain and mouth ulcers.  
Since June I sometimes have thick mucus draining backward from my throat that doesn’t exit through my nose. It drips backward, making me clear my throat and cough. Yesterday in the heat I had very strong drainage and had to cough repeatedly.  
Nasal and oral swab tests were negative.  
My ENT says my nasal mucosa is swollen, but suspects a dental rather than ENT origin. I got my wisdom teeth removed afterwards.

**Childhood history**

As a child (10 years ago) I had very similar symptoms. They investigated for a long time; initially they said it was psychological, but eventually they discovered an egg allergy and reflux. I improved once I removed egg from my diet and received reflux treatment.  
I was symptom-free for 10 years, though on two occasions, when I accidentally ingested a tiny amount of egg, I was unwell for days.  
I also have known lactose intolerance.  
In childhood I took many antibiotics and often had sinus infections. Later I had mild bronchitis, which resolved after treatment.

David’s flight into Boston had already been delayed twice, his phone battery was down to 8%, and he still had to get from Logan Airport to a big client meeting in the Financial District. Missing it wasn’t an option.

By the time he landed, the airport was packed. People were scrambling for taxis, rideshares kept canceling because of traffic, and every minute that passed made him more nervous. He opened his email, scrolled through the confirmation, and saw the line that finally made him relax:

>

As he walked out, he immediately saw a professionally dressed chauffeur holding a sign with his name. No searching, no waiting in the cold, no stress. His luggage was taken care of in seconds, and he was escorted to a spotless black sedan waiting just outside.

Inside the car, it was quiet and calm. Soft music playing, bottled water in the door, phone charger ready. The chauffeur already had David’s destination loaded into the GPS and had checked the traffic in advance. Instead of trying to fight for a taxi, David was now sitting in the back, sending last-minute emails and reviewing his presentation on the way into the city.

What really surprised him wasn’t just the comfort, but the timing. Even with heavy morning traffic, the chauffeur knew all the right routes. He pointed out a few Boston landmarks along the way, but never made the ride feel like a tour — just smooth, efficient, and professional.

**David arrived at his meeting 10 minutes early.**

No rushing through the lobby, no sweat, no panic. Just a calm walk into the building, coffee in hand, ready to focus on what actually mattered: closing the deal.

On the way back to the airport later that day, he booked Blue Nile Livery again — this time through their website — and decided this would be his new routine whenever he flew into Boston.

If you’ve ever had a stressful airport experience in Boston, you know how much difference a reliable chauffeur service can make. With **professional drivers, clean luxury vehicles, and on-time pickups**, Blue Nile Livery turns a stressful travel day into a smooth one.

I am a big fan of chai and coffee premixes due to their convenience. But due to their high sugar content and low nutritional value, they are not a valuable addition to my diet. The quality of tea/coffee used is also sub par. Vande Bharat trains also serve such substandard product of chaayos/girnar/wagh bakri in its trains. 

I am looking to make a clean chai/coffee premix that has just to be mixed with hot water. It would be enhanced with protein powder and other neutraceuticals (lions mane mushroom, magnesium glycinate, l tyrosine, rhodiola or anything likewise) and used a sugar substitute like stevia or monkfruit.

I was recently prescribed elvanse at 30mg starting dose. I took it on the first day and felt energetic, like I wanted to get stuff done, reasonably good mood though had some real moments or irritation and grumpiness. I had this wired buzzy feeling in my chest, like I'd had 20 cups of coffee, this is not a feeling I enjoy! When I went to bed that night, about 13-14 hours after taking it, it felt mostly worn off though my heart was racing which made it very difficult to sleep and I had a terrible night overall. The next day, took it again and the wired feeling was even stronger. I just felt like I was on drugs basically, but still sober if that makes any sense, but the heart racing wired feeling was more intense and it was unpleasant. At this point I thought this dose was too strong and maybe I should have started at 20. I didn't notice a lot of benefit to my attention or focus at work, though I was generally more engaged / chatty with people. I was restless and found myself chewing the inside of my cheeks. Then the headache set in, I have TMJ issues that cause headaches and I think the jaw clenching massively flared it up. I also slept really badly again. I emailed problem shared asking if I could try 20mg instead but they didn't get back to me, so I didnt take it on day 3 and struggled with a bad headache all day. Today (day 4), I decided to take a half dose by dissolving in water and drinking half of it, well it was a bit more than that so maybe 17mg approx, but I don't really feel much except a bad tension headache and a little bit of a tense anxious feeling. 

I know people say to try it for a while and titrate etc but I guess I'm wondering if this is just the wrong med for me? I thought that on day 1 I would get a good sense of whether it works - e.g., I'd be more focused, but all I seem to get is this unpleasant feeling like I've done a big line of speed and tried to go to work, which just feels wrong!

The Java House has gotten a little less bad...I think they're closing around 8 these days.

Coralville coffee shops seem to stay open later. But I remember a day when the Java House closed at midnight. It wasn't even that long ago.

1p7avc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1p7avc1/how_efficient_are_lap_desks/,How efficient are lap desks?,"So this may no be exactly a PC related question, in fact it’s a Switch 2 question because I’m a “Nintendrone”. I play games mostly on my Nintendo Switch 2 because I’m a dumb Nintendo fanboy/shill who isn’t worthy of the master race title; being able to get 500fps at 8k when I play Minecraft, so I forever deserve this Scarlett letter that I proudly wear in front of all of you.

Now that that’s out of the way, I wanted to know how good/comfortable lap desks are. For those who aren’t familiar, the Switch 2 has a feature that allows you to use your joycon as a mouse when you turn it on it’s side. Now when I play my Switch 2 docked, I play at my desk which allows me to use this mouse feature in the most optimal way it was designed for.

However, I have a friend who plays his Switch 2 docked in his living room either on his couch or in his lazy boy chair. Of course he has a coffee table in front of it, but, it’s not the most effective way to use the mouse feature. For Christmas, I wanted to get him something that would greatly enhance the mouse mode feature on his Switch 2 while using the system’s mouse mode and I wanted to know for anyone’s who’s used a lap desk if they’re comfortable and good at creating a firm and stable surface for a mouse? I’d assume that at least a few of you have used your PC’s or steam decks hooked up to a giant TV in your living room, so, with that I would assume you ran into a similar problem if you wanted to play something that used a mouse. Anything feedback would be greatly appreciated to help my buddy have a better experience while playing Metroid Prime 4: Beyond or any Switch 2 game that uses a mouse. Thanks in advance for any feedback you can provide!! 🙏",2,1764171509.0,pcmasterrace,1,0.75,False

I've been using this method for a couple of months to save a bit on my regular spending.
 
The Gist: Always buy an e-gift card right before you pay at a ton of popular places. You get a small cashback kickback instantly.
 
How it works:
 
You're about to pay for lunch, coffee, or online shopping.
 
Before paying, you quickly open Snaplii. That aggregates over 400 merchants.
 
Search for the store you're literally standing in/about to order from.
 
Buy an e-gift card for the amount you need. You'll instantly see a ""reward"" or cashback added to your account (usually 2-30%).
 
Use the e-gift card to pay immediately. You just paid less than the face value.
 
Why it's cool:
 
It works for hundreds of everyday spots – think Starbucks, Uber Eats, Sephora, your local pizza place. Covers pretty much all ""food, shopping, entertainment"" needs.
 
The cashback is instant, not one of those ""wait 90 days"" things.
 
It stacks on top of any existing sales or loyalty points.

I have a sign-up bonus that basically gives you $5 to start with (covers your first coffee). If you're interested, DM me and I can tell you the code and  point you in the right direction. Don't want to post links here and look like an ad.
 
Honestly, it just makes me feel smart for doing something I was going to do anyway. Hope it helps someone else save a few bucks!

The Ducks have won 8 of their 10 games at home this season, and with Vancouver putting in an “emergency” goalie option, I imagine Anaheim’s offense will take full advantage of both Demko & Lankinen’s absence. As for the visitors, the Canucks have proven to be no slouch against the Ducks having won 10 of their last 11 meetings; both offenses should turn up in spades here. I’m on the Over to cash.

1p7asu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1p7asu4/random_illness_which_could_be_mcas_throat_issues/,Random illness which could be MCAS - Throat issues,"**Hello everyone!**   
Since the summer I’ve been struggling with a very strange illness, and so far the doctors haven’t been able to give me any concrete answers. The **papillae** on my tongue swell up, my throat swells, I feel tightness behind my uvula, a foreign-body or “**bone-like**” sensation, pressure. Sometimes it’s better, sometimes worse, it fluctuates completely, and my tongue looks like a map. Since September I’ve been on a reflux- and histamine-free diet, but my symptoms are not improving.  
I’ll describe what has happened to me.  
*What do you think this could be? What would you recommend? The throat pain and tightness are making my everyday life very difficult, and I’m living in constant fear.*

**Background**

I hadn’t really been ill for about two years. But this May I had an upper respiratory infection, followed a few weeks later by severe lower abdominal pain. One doctor thought it was a cyst, another suspected a bowel issue, and another a urinary tract infection. It resolved within a week and a half. Before that I saw a gynecologist, who found everything normal. They wanted to treat me for a UTI, but my mother suspected that the thick mucus produced during my sinusitis had drained down my throat into my stomach. I was given Azi Sandoz.  
After that I began developing eczematous symptoms, mostly around the outer lower lip area and the armpits. Also, two years ago I had nasal surgery to correct a deviated septum.

**Onset of symptoms**

My symptoms began on **08 June**. That day I was visiting a friend, we talked, had coffee, and a few hours later I drank Coke and developed very strong neck spasms. I felt a “bone floating” sensation in my throat, tightness, pressure on the laryngeal cartilage, and needle-like pains around my tonsils, as if I had swallowed a needle. The lymph nodes under my jaw swelled, the thyroid area hurt, and I had pain at the base of my throat near the collarbone. It lasted for hours. At the ER they found nothing; they examined me with an **endoscope** and looked into my throat.  
A few days later I got better and could eat everything, but on the day of the symptoms I only had some onion cream soup and Alpro soy yogurt. I also noticed a small red spot inside my cheek that disappeared the next day, as if a vessel had burst.

About two weeks later I went to the ER again. At work I had coffee (I usually drink it with almond milk), the AC was blowing strongly, and a colleague next to me was cleaning with a spray called Pronto. Immediately I felt throat tightness and pressure, my voice became hoarse, I couldn’t swallow, as if even water would get stuck. At the hospital they suspected reflux but didn’t call it an allergic reaction. I was given Suprastin through IV.  
At home I tried eating a reflux-friendly diet, but the symptoms kept coming back (even when I wasn’t eating—for example I felt the same tightness sitting in the air-conditioned train).  
**I noticed reactions to certain foods**: Jogobella lactose-free peach yogurt, chocolate, ice cream, and coffee caused immediate symptoms. I cut them out.  
One day I took Suprastin and then felt strong throat burning for three hours, couldn’t eat, and became very sleepy. A nurse we know advised me to stop taking it; instead I tried Calcimusc, but it didn’t help.  
I went back to work...  
I had a water bottle I used at university. Inside its rubber straw I noticed tiny black marker-like dots—someone said it was **mold**, so I threw it out immediately.  
One day I ate a Döner kebab with no issues. Later that week I ate grapes during the day and bought gyros and grape juice from the same kebab place for dinner. By evening my tongue itched, the **lymph nodes in my throat swelled**, the tightness and painful swallowing came back, and my **neck hurt.**  
Not long after, on a Thursday, I tried making pastelli at home with flower honey and sesame seeds. My tongue became blistered and itchy, so my parents took me to the ER in an other city. The doctor said my tongue looked completely normal.  
I continued the **reflux diet a**nd took medications (Noacid, Gaviscon, Salvus water therapy).  
Coffee still tightened my throat, so I cut it out entirely. I tried mate tea and matcha instead. Matcha was fine for a few days, then it also caused throat tightness, though milder. Banana caused slight itching on my tongue.  
I can feel myself getting very weak, I’ve unfortunately lost weight, and eating is becoming increasingly difficult.

**Around July 30**, on a Thursday, I ate a tortilla wrap with organic yogurt, cucumber, plain chicken, and lactose-free cheese. I started itching, so I ate a yogurt (Alpro blueberry soy yogurt). I had eaten it before with no issue, but this time my tongue swelled completely, went numb, and developed a **rock-hard lump that was palpable**. I took probiotics, fermented carrot, Fenistil drops, and lemon balm tea. It took hours for the swelling to go down; the lump disappeared after an hour. But I had chills all evening.  
On Friday and Saturday I kept feeling cold, was sleepy, and could barely eat. By Sunday I was better, but the throat tightness and laryngeal pressure returned.  
After that I felt sharp, follicle-like pain in my **tonsils**. I took Flector, but the pain continued. It radiated toward the corners of my mouth where the **eczema** had previously appeared, as if the pain traveled from my tongue. I felt intense itching. On the left side, near the lymph nodes, my throat felt like something was poking my tonsil and ear.  
On Tuesday I went to my GP, who said I had mouth **ulcers** and gave me Anaftin spray. A week later I improved.  
In the summer I noticed that heat made my throat tighten more. After meals it was sensitive, but sometimes it happened without food.  
I also noticed that when reactions occurred—or as they were fading—my skin on my throat and chin often itched. Red, itchy patches appeared.

**Later events**

On 29 August I took an iron + folic acid tablet.  
Immediately after swallowing it my tongue began to swell (like in the yogurt incident), rock-hard lumps appeared, it reddened, and the tongue glands elongated like **stringy coral** when touched. I took Fenistil drops and went to the ER, where—since I reacted badly to both Suprastin and Revicet—they gave me a magnesium solution intravenously. The itching stopped, but my throat remained sensitive, with stabbing sensations at times around the thyroid area.  
My tongue stayed sensitive and blistered, so the next day I could only eat porridge.  
Two days later, around 5 p.m., I developed strong neck spasms again. I couldn’t swallow, even water wouldn’t go down, and I felt dizzy. My parents took me to a big city, where ENT examinations were normal.  
The doctor suspected histamine intolerance and reflux. I was given pantoprazole via infusion; halfway through I could drink again.  
The next day I could again only eat porridge. I felt better, but at 4 a.m. (on 01 September) I woke up with chest pain. I ate a little. My head felt foggy, my chest felt empty and pressured, and I couldn’t fall back asleep for a long time. I was belching (presumably from reflux). I couldn’t lie down. When I woke up again later, I felt blisters behind my uvula and on my palate, plus stinging in my throat.  
On 01 September afternoon I had diarrhea. Lower stomach and bowel pain began, easing after meals.  
My thyroid area felt swollen and tender, like having follicles.  
After this, with the help of a dietitian, I started a strict histamine-free diet, which I still follow.  
My symptoms improved while taking Zyrtec, but pressure and stabbing around the laryngeal cartilage/thyroid area persist, as if the bone itself hurts. Sometimes my tonsils feel follicular. Sometimes my throat stiffens and slightly enlarges, then suddenly returns to normal—this happens with temperature changes. Because of the cold weather we had to turn on the AC for heating, and when it blew strongly, my throat tightened and I had to go outside into the cold air to feel better.  
This period also brought strong headaches, especially since mid-September. Constant fatigue, as if my body cannot rest.  
Sometimes I react to certain foods, other times not. This happened with grated apple mixed with cane sugar and cinnamon (Ceylon), shredded coconut, and blueberries. Chicken breast causes no symptoms, but slightly tougher chicken thigh made my **tongue sensitive.**  
2025.10.23 — In the evening, after eating oatmeal (which previously caused no symptoms), the back of my tongue near the tonsils became painful, sharp, scratchy, and the lymph nodes on both sides were sore.

Additionally, water started to drip from my nose inexplicably when I bent down — twice. It wasn’t blood or mucus, **just clear water.**

**Other information**

Thyroid ultrasound was normal. Tryptase and cortisol tests were done.  
I had stool and microbiome tests, which showed **Leaky Gut syndrome** — I am currently receiving treatment for this.  
In October I had no foreign-body sensation, but around 06 November it returned.  
**MCAS** is suspected as a complication; I’m taking quercetin for it.  
A hematologist suspected Crohn’s disease, but my stools and appetite are normal. Weight loss happened due to throat pain and mouth ulcers.  
Since June I sometimes have thick mucus draining backward from my throat that doesn’t exit through my nose. It drips backward, making me clear my throat and cough. Yesterday in the heat I had very strong drainage and had to cough repeatedly.  
Nasal and oral swab tests were negative.  
My ENT says my nasal mucosa is swollen, but suspects a dental rather than ENT origin. I got my wisdom teeth removed afterwards.

**Childhood history**

As a child (10 years ago) I had very similar symptoms. They investigated for a long time; initially they said it was psychological, but eventually they discovered an egg allergy and reflux. I improved once I removed egg from my diet and received reflux treatment.  
I was symptom-free for 10 years, though on two occasions, when I accidentally ingested a tiny amount of egg, I was unwell for days.  
I also have known lactose intolerance.  
In childhood I took many antibiotics and often had sinus infections. Later I had mild bronchitis, which resolved after treatment.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me and most likely never will. Around 6 years ago I took LSD for the first time. The trip was like a glitch my brain couldn’t register it. After the first encounter I started noticing things. I would catch myself laughing at tv shows and thought it was weird, extremely irritable, daydreaming

The 2nd trip was months later and at the peak of all this. Barely getting breaks from work, stressed all day from lack of sleep and mad people bc they wouldn’t do their job so I would have to do it. I came home from work mad, stressed every emotion you could think of weighing down on me. Decided it was the best time to take LSD with my friends being sleep deprived like an idiot… For 12/15 hours I was stuck in this hellish trance. After the trip was over residual effects were still persistent, but I ignored them. I remember trying to ignore it all and I was walking downstairs to the kitchen with dishes and my body was faster than my brain and I dropped them all I felt was weakness and disappointment in myself. Still continued to go to school, work all of this while smoking weed until I graduated. I was barely even aware of what was happening I don’t even really remember senior year of high school. I quit work I quit smoking weed bc now I get freaked out when I take any sort of mind altering substance. Pushed myself away from all my friends started isolating myself what the hell are they supposed to do I shouldn’t drag people down bc of my own stupidity. 

Around 2 years ago I finally went to a mental hospital yet all I did there was take some drugs and walk in circles in that place. There was other young adults there my age, they had games everything even a damn coffee machine. However, the food was terrible I barely ate. I have rotten teeth and wanted to be left alone. I was in a place I didn’t know with people I didn’t know. It was like a vacation for young adults doing yoga and shit felt like I was the only one there who wasn’t normal. After I left the drugs they gave me had terrible side effects I emailed them didn’t get an answer so I stopped taking them. 

For the last 2 years I’ve been doing nothing. Always stuck in my head out of touch with reality it’s like I’m drowning yet not fully submerged, but now I’m having terrible symptoms again. Restlessness, overthinking all that. Imprisoned by my own mind… 

I don’t talk to anyone don’t do anything I liked before. I used to walk miles a day, talk and laugh my ass off with friends and family, go fishing, played video games, but now I barely exist it’s like the person I was before is dead I’m a hallowed out version of what I once was. As if I’m a description a bunch of people trying to explain who I am, but there’s something missing. 

I have no money I’m sitting in my room at my parent house everyday watching tv and playing on my phone basically waiting to die. As terrible as it sounds there is really nothing that can reverse the damage to my brain. I don’t recognize myself in the mirror, don’t recognize my voice my personality has changed drastically. 

I don’t know what to do…

1p7aqcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1p7aqcv/update_my_parents_are_giving_my_sister_the_same/,UPDATE: My parents are giving my sister the same amount of money I saved for two years as a graduation gift,"I posted a few days ago about my parents giving my sister Elsa 45,000 SEK for finishing a 6-month certificate program when I got 500 SEK for completing a 4-year university degree. A lot of you told me I wasn't being petty and that the favoritism was real. I needed to hear that.

Here's what happened.

I decided to talk to my dad directly. He usually stays out of things but I thought maybe one-on-one he'd be honest with me. I asked him to meet me for coffee yesterday.

I laid it all out. The difference in gifts. The years of feeling like Elsa got more support. The ""she struggled more"" justification that basically punishes me for being responsible.

He was quiet for a long time. Then he said something that broke me.

""Your mother and I always knew you'd be fine. You're the strong one. Elsa needs more help. That's just how it is.""

I'm the strong one. So I get less. Because they decided when I was a kid that I didn't need them the same way.

I asked him if he realized that ""being strong"" meant I just stopped asking for help because I knew I wouldn't get it. That I worked 25 hours a week through university while Elsa's part-time job was ""too stressful"" so they covered her expenses. That I've been financially independent since I was 22 while they still pay Elsa's phone bill.

He looked uncomfortable. Said he ""never thought about it that way.""

That's the problem. They never thought about it at all.

I told him I wasn't angry about the money specifically. I was angry about what it represented. A lifetime of being the kid they didn't worry about, which translated into being the kid they didn't invest in.

He said he'd talk to my mom.

Last night my mom called. I thought maybe she'd apologize. Maybe dad got through to her.

Instead she said I had ""upset your father"" by ""making him feel guilty"" and that I needed to ""let this go"" because it was ""ruining Elsa's celebration.""

Elsa's celebration. Still not about me at all.

I told my mom I needed some space. That I loved them but I couldn't pretend this didn't hurt. She said I was ""being dramatic"" and ""holding a grudge over money"" and that she ""raised me better than this.""

I haven't responded. I don't know what to say.

Elsa texted me this morning. Not an apology. She said ""Mom told me you're upset about the money thing. I didn't ask them for it, they offered. It's not my fault they wanted to do something nice for me.""

She's right that she didn't ask. But she also didn't acknowledge that the disparity is real or that my feelings are valid. Just more ""sorry you feel that way"" energy.

1p7aoep,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustSportsLove/comments/1p7aoep/didnt_expect_this_but_hitting_a_hanging_leather/,Didn’t expect this… but hitting a hanging leather cricket ball might be the best ASMR + stress relief combo I’ve ever tried.,"So this started as a weird experiment.

I work from home, and like most of you, Zoom meetings + screen time were frying my brain every single day. I’d log off a call and feel that heavy cognitive fog — the kind where even coffee doesn’t do anything.

A friend jokingly said “Bro, go hit something.”  
I thought he meant a punching bag.  
But I don’t have space for that in my small apartment.

What I *do* have is a little balcony… and a bat.

So I bought a **hanging leather cricket ball** (this one: [https://www.svbsports.com/products/hanging-cricket-ball-practice-leather](https://www.svbsports.com/products/hanging-cricket-ball-practice-leather)), hung it on a hook, and I SWEAR I wasn’t prepared for the ASMR experience that followed.



# 🎧 The ASMR Element Nobody Talks About

If you’re into ASMR — tapping, rhythmic sounds, repetitive actions — then you need to hear the sound of a leather ball meeting the middle of the bat.

It’s not just a “thud.”  
It’s a *dense*, satisfying, almost therapeutic **cork-core thump**.

There’s a reason people say “nothing beats the sound of leather on willow.”  
When you hit a hanging ball:

* the swing makes a soft whoosh
* the impact gives that clean ASMR thump
* the follow-through has its own rhythm

Your brain enters this weirdly calming loop.

It feels like mechanical meditation.

Add in the sound of the ball swinging back toward you?  
Bro, that’s literally a *metronome of calm*.



# 🧠 Why It Works (Actual Science Behind It)

This is the part I didn’t expect.

I did some reading and found out there’s an actual neurological explanation for why hitting a hanging ball helps with stress and ASMR sensations.

# ✔ 1. Eye Movement Reset (EMDR Effect)

Your eyes track the moving ball side-to-side.  
This is the same mechanism used in trauma therapy (EMDR).  
It literally resets the brain’s focus pathways.

# ✔ 2. Gross Motor Activation

Typing = fine motor stress  
Hitting = large muscle relaxation

Your shoulders, back, and core move freely → tension drops.

# ✔ 3. Rhythmic Repetition = Flow State

Once you get into a consistent knocking rhythm, the brain stops multitasking and enters a single-task, flow-like zone.

# ✔ 4. Real Leather = Real Feedback

There’s something about the weight (156g) and density of a proper cricket leather ball that triggers a grounding effect.

BTW, the one I’m using is this one:  
[https://www.svbsports.com/products/hanging-cricket-ball-practice-leather](https://www.svbsports.com/products/hanging-cricket-ball-practice-leather)  
(Sharing because people keep asking — not an ad.)



# 🏠 Why It’s Perfect for Small Spaces

You don’t need a lawn.  
You don’t need a net.  
You don’t need a partner.

You literally need:

* one hook
* one rope
* one ball
* one bat

It takes **zero floor space** and you can install it in:

* balcony
* garage
* hostel room
* corridor
* even a doorway

My entire setup cost less than most people’s headphones lol.



# 🎧 ASMR + Fitness + Focus Reset in 5 Minutes

Here’s my quick “mental reset routine”:

**Over 1 – Loosener**  
Big movements, wake up shoulders.

**Over 2 – Tracking**  
Watch the ball closely, bat middle only.  
Instant eye reset.

**Over 3 – Rhythm**  
Just listen. Let the sound take over.  
This is where you get that ASMR zone.

It takes under 5 minutes and feels way better than scrolling Instagram.



# ⏳ Bonus: Helps With Cricket Skills Too

* Bat timing improves
* Middle-of-the-bat consistency increases
* Hand–eye coordination becomes crazy sharp

You stay fit without “exercising.”



# ❤️ If You Want To Try It

People DM me asking which ball I use, so here’s the link:  
👉 [**https://www.svbsports.com/products/hanging-cricket-ball-practice-leather**](https://www.svbsports.com/products/hanging-cricket-ball-practice-leather)

Again — not promoting anything, just sharing because the experience caught me off guard. If you enjoy ASMR, or you’re dealing with screen fatigue, or you just need a healthy break from work, give this a try.

Worst case?  
You get a fun stress toy.

Best case?  
You find a new ritual that clears your mind better than meditation or coffee.

Jill and Alex, like many young couples in their early 30s, had built a fast-paced life in Los Angeles. Long hours, endless traffic, and a sky that never quite goes dark because of city lights. When Jill suggested they drive to rural Michigan for Thanksgiving to meet her parents for the first time, Alex smiled politely and said “Sure.” He had never stepped foot on a farm in his life.

They arrived at Jill’s childhood home just as the last golden light was spilling across the fields. Her parents, Mike and Linda, raise dozens of vegetables, keep a small **orchard** of apple and pear trees, and grow row upon row of pumpkins that look like orange lanterns in November. The air smelled of woodsmoke and **frost-kissed** soil.

Alex’s eyes went wide the moment he stepped out of the car. He grew up seeing palm trees and billboards; now he was surrounded by endless quiet, red barns, and deer walking calmly at the edge of the woods.

The next morning, Mike took Alex on a long walk through the fields. While they walked between the rows of harvested corn stalks, Mike spoke about the rhythm of the seasons – planting in spring, **tending** all summer, and the intense, joyful work of **harvest** in autumn. He explained how his own grandfather had bought this land after World War II, how every pumpkin pie on their Thanksgiving table came from soil someone in the family had touched. Alex listened, speechless. In LA, “knowing where your food comes from” is a marketing slogan. Here, it was simply reality.

That night, Alex stepped outside after dinner. He looked up and froze. The sky was packed with stars – millions of them, brighter and closer than any planetarium show he’d ever seen. For the first time in his life, he could see the Milky Way with the naked eye. Somewhere in the dark, a deer snorted softly in the orchard.

It was hunting season in Michigan, but Mike had put his rifle away this year. “I’d rather spend the time with my daughter,” he told Alex quietly. “Deer will be here next year. She might not be.”

They stayed for a full week. Alex learned to split firewood, helped carry **bushels** of apples into the barn, and sat on the porch drinking coffee while the sun came up red over the fields. Something quiet and deep shifted inside him. The constant buzz of notifications felt suddenly far away and unimportant.

On the last morning, as they packed the car, Alex **lingered** by the pumpkin patch. Jill found him there, staring at the frost-covered vines.

“I don’t want to leave,” he said simply.

He looked at Jill differently that day – with a kind of calm **certainty** he’d never felt before. City life had been exciting, but this place had reminded him what “enough” could feel like. **Roots**. Seasons. Family. A future you can touch and taste and pass down.

Sometimes it only takes one week of harvest air and star-filled nights to realize you’re ready to plant something that lasts.

Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. May your holidays bring you **clarity**, connection, and maybe a few stars you’ve never noticed before.

1p7aklx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/comments/1p7aklx/windowremission_of_symptoms_due_to_caffeine_and/,Window/Remission of Symptoms Due to Caffeine and ALLIUM Cessation (UDPATE),"Hello, PSSD Reddit Community!

One month ago, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/comments/1odzr75/pssd_recoveryremission_windows_after_cessation_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) regarding my PSSD symptoms and how the cessation of caffeine affected my PSSD recovery, windows, and remission of symptoms. I've posted two updates since then, which can be found [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/comments/1ookq0g/update_on_pssd_symptoms_and_cessation_of_caffeine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/comments/1oz8hdy/pssd_update_and_caffeine_cessation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

If you do not have time to read my past posts, the TL;DR is:

1. I've been experiencing windows for two months, but my update history recorded here begins one month ago. This is explained in my first post.

2. I am 29M with typical PSSD symptoms: Delayed Ejaculation, Anorgasmia, Genital Numbness/Anhedonia, and a lack of Nocturnal Penile Tumescence; additionally, I have some emotional anhedonia with limited ability to feel sadness, depression, and anxiety.

3. I initially ceased drinking caffeine for three weeks by coincidence and found two of my atypical symptoms (at least, I believe they're atypical) resolved: I would feel pain in my testes and my ejaculations would feel unsatisfactory; the latter, in the sense that sex would still leave me feeling ""pent up"" . Since ceasing caffeine, these symptoms have completely gone away.

I would like to note that I have never had an issue with caffeine consumption prior to PSSD. I've been a coffee-consumer since 16, and enjoying coffee ice cream from a local place since even younger. It was extremely difficult for me to let go of coffee in order to relieve these symptoms, especially since my recovery period was *three weeks*. If you are considering ceasing caffeine consumption, please be mindful and patient that recovery is not immediate, and stick to your goals.

For the actual UPDATE part of this post: in my most recent post made 9 days ago (as of creating this update), I said that white chocolate caused a relapse in my PSSD symptoms and I felt that I needed to stop consuming it in order to regain a window. In addition to white chocolate, I stopped consuming garlic powder and onion powder at the same time. Since ceasing all three, I have begun to experience a new window. I would say that I'm 80%-90% recovered in this window; which, isn't perfect, but it's still a much better improvement compared to what I was dealing with. I stopped consuming garlic/onion on Wednesday, November 19th, 2025 and my window returned on the 22nd. Today is the 26th and I'm still experiencing the window. To be clear:

1. My delayed ejaculation symptom is mostly resolved. It is not difficult to ejaculate, but it takes a little longer to do so than it used to.

2. My ability to orgasm has returned. I would gauge it at 80%-90% of its original pleasure.

3. I am experiencing Nocturnal Penile Tumescence again.

4. My emotional anhedonia seems to be resolving. I've been able to cry (and have panic attacks, unfortunately), when otherwise I wasn't able to.

I would also like to clarify that I had no sensitivity to alliums (garlic/onion) prior to PSSD. They were two of my favorite flavors.

First, the STM strike. My entire daily schedule has been forced to change three times in the last few months because of it. I finally started getting used to my new routine… and then Hydro-Québec’s controlled power outages began. During one of them, my microwave and refrigerator got fried.

All tame topics. I did not ask her about her periods or waffle etc. anything like that as suggested by you guyz

Where things stand now:

I won’t share screenshots for privacy, but here’s the pattern:

She texts me first sometimes(rarely- like sharing reels) 

She checks where I disappear during conversations

She replies fast, uses emojis, reacts to messages

She shares memes, reels, and random updates

She doesn’t get awkward when I check on her

Today she asked me to come meet her

She even told me her exact location multiple times (“Brezza ke piche hu”, “right taraf aao”)

She asked me to bring her cold coffee too if I was drinking. 

She wasn’t shy or weird at all in person today

And we’ve only met twice in person so far.

I am trying to follow you guys earlier advice and keep it slow, playful, not too intense.
And honestly, it seems to be working because she hasn’t pulled back instead she’s gotten a bit warmer like laughing and has been anbit nostalgic on how similar our situations have been(seperately) 

My Question: Based on this update, how should I move forward?
Keep it slow and casual for a few more meets?
Increase flirting gradually?(I am not much knowledgeable about it- I know banter tho) 

And how do girls usually interpret small interactions like this based on this situation 😊

Any do’s/don’ts for the next 2–3 in-person meets would help. Thanks! 🙌

Previous post:

Girls, I need your POV because my guy friends are giving me garbage advice.

I’m a college guy (early 20s) and recently started talking to this girl from another department. We met once for something college-related, but we ended up texting a lot afterwards — sharing random updates, jokes, stupid campus struggles, all that.

Yesterday she was in bad period pain + cravings. I sent her a small waffle/ice-cream surprise. She thanked me a lot and we’re meeting tomorrow for 10–15 mins before her test.

Now here’s where I’m clueless:

If YOU were the girl, would this come off as:

A cute thoughtful gesture

A guy trying too hard

Just friendly

Or something that would make you see him differently?

Because I’m genuinely starting to like her, but I have no idea if I’m being sweet or accidentally brother-zoning myself.

Girls, please tell me honestly:
How would you interpret this if a guy did it for you?
And how should I move forward without making it weird?

I was getting along fine with most of my class, were around 30 people but somewhere along the way things went wrong. Slowly groups formed like in secret, the groups I thought i belonged to seemed to just hangout without inviting me but I thought it was random. The work started exhausting me and everyone else seemed fine. The past few weeks every day has been worse than the other. I feel excluded from every group. I'm not invited to hangouts and they make plans in front of me without inviting me. When I invite them for a coffee they come but then the whole hangout they inside joke and talk about their other hangouts that I wasn't invited to. The people gossip a lot in general and I also get really insecure that maybe I'm talked about like that as well. I just feel lost, I haven't felt like this in years and I keep trying to calm myself down saying it will get better but I doubt it, I'm depressed and scared and crying has become part of my daily routine.

I can't stay asleep for anymore than several hours. I don't have much problem actually falling asleep most nights. Especially when I take some melatonin. But if I go to bed at midnight, I wake up around 4a and I'm wide awake. If I go to bed at 10p, like last night then I wake up at 2a and will be wide awake.

And then after waking up, I'll toss and turn for 2 to 3 hours, then after that maybe drifting in and out of very light sleep until the alarm goes off for work. And then I feel utterly exhausted. I then drag through the day, just to repeat the same process the next. I can't wait till weekends just so I can catch up from accumulated sleep deprivation through the week. It's getting to the point that it's really effecting my life and making it hard to concentrate at work meetings and such.

I don't know what causes this, but it seems to have been a problem that's arisen over the last few years.

I don't drink caffeine before bed. I have caffeinated tea in the morning. I don't drink coffee. Maybe a can of soda a few times a week. Mostly drink water with lemon juice. Very rarely drink alcohol. No drugs whatsoever.

I do tend to be online at night and look at screens, though I also use a night view mode to cut down on blue light. Not sure if that does any good or not, but it's worth a try.

I do experience insomnia here and there with falling asleep, but most nights it's not an issue. It's just staying sleep more than a few hours. I can only recall one night in my entire adult life where I went to bed and didn't wake up *at all* until morning. I felt so incredibly rested. I would give anything to sleep like that every night.

1p7a9ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1p7a9ai/am_i_doing_the_right_thing_exgfsituationship_stuff/,Am I doing the right thing? ExGF/situationship stuff.,"TLDR; twice broken up with. First time because “I deserve better”, second time because she “wants to keep her options open/be single while she gets her masters”. Now she is asking for me back and says she has clarity on what she wants in life. I said I would need some time before I could feel like we could talk about a serious relationship again. For some reason I feel like a total asshole for saying that. I still love her and I want to be with her and I WANT to trust that she is serious this time. Am I fucking everything up?

Backstory- last paragraph is where I am at now:

Last year I(30F) met a wonderful, amazing woman (25F). We talked about realizing our sexuality recently, wanting to date women, we really hit it off immediately, and we had both had huge crushes on each other months leading up to this. It started as a “let’s just have fun” baby gay sort of thing and really was just that for months. From the jump it was communicated in depth that in a year or two from that time I had planned to study abroad in Sweden for a few years. Oddly enough, she had been trying to find a way to study in Scandinavia for her masters as it was her dream in high school and even showed me journal entries from when she was in high school talking about how it was her dream. Regardless, she was scared of doing so and unsure if she was willing to jump through the hoops it takes to do so. So anyways, at this point we were fine just being friends with benefits. It was safe, kind, communicative, SO much fun and just really special. And of course with that, we started getting the feels. 

She started with calling me pet names, and saying more committed relationship type stuff and calling me her girlfriend. I was a bit thrown off but hey, I liked it and thought it was cool. I communicated with her that I was down to make our relationship official, I could easily find a way for her to study her masters in Sweden with me (I have family here, super easy work for me), and that i have no issues or complaints about a year or two of long distance and I was willing to make it work. She IMMEDIATELY jumped ship. Did the whole “I’m not good for you, I’m just going to end up hurting you, you deserve better, I need to work on myself” run around. I shrugged my shoulders…. Okay that’s fine (very confused why she initiated calling me her gf and such though). 

A month or so goes by, we see each other out at coffee shops and such. I kept it friendly, easy, clean. She started getting friendlier and friendlier. (This is maybe 5 months after first talking) Eventually she tells me she always severely regretted breaking up with me and that she knew it was because she was being avoidant. In short, we started hanging out again and she started being more touchy and calling me pet names and her girlfriend again. For the second time I let it happen cause it felt good (I know I know). Over time we started talking about dating again. This second time she seemed more serious, started talking about moving to Europe a little bit after I moved to go to school, and we fell very much in love and started a relationship. It was a really beautiful and wonderful 6 months. 

So, I moved to Sweden, as planned. Leading up to literally the second I left she had talked about me sending her sweaters that smelled like me, how much she loves me, all this future life marriage and kids daydreaming talk, how perfect we are together, and all the ways we could stay romantic and connected long distance for a while. I planned on buying her a ticket to stay with me as she had a year left of undergrad before she could move. There would essentially be 4-6 months gaps of us seeing each other for a year or so. Then I got here…… she got totally cold, stopped calling me pet names, and in a phone call told me how she has always wanted to be single during her masters program and at one point in a harsh tone said “maybe I just want to keep my options open”. That hurt lol. So obviously Thats a breakup and we did no contact for…. Well…. About 2 weeks lol.

NOW: she got into contact with me and told me she has way more clarity now. She apologized for some of the things she said and how hurtful they were. How she understands now what’s important in life and that she can’t picture her life without me. That she doesn’t know why she said she wants to keep her options open because it’s not how she feels and yeah…. It literally just feels like the first time. I told her I was not willing to just jump back into a relationship immediately after that, that her saying she wanted to keep her options open and the emotional whiplash from just days prior her gushing over me and talking about future plans. I told her if we ever had a conversation like that again it would have to be very clear that it’s coming from an emotionally secure and grounded place and that it’s clear that that would take some time. There was a lot of other stuff, talk about how she realized she had some internalized homophobia, how she feels stupid because she literally can’t imagine life without me and that she threw away a picturesque adventure with a partner who treats her well because she is scared of committing and relinquishing some type of freedom. Anyways….. yeah I don’t know I feel guilty about not being open to just getting back together. Am I in the right for saying I need some time? I do love her, and I would love to be with her again, but I am having a hard time trusting that when things get serious again that she won’t just bail. ",2,1764170076.0,LesbianActually,1,1.0,False

I’ve been quietly working on a small passion project here, a **botanical drink mix inspired by an Indonesian calm + focus ritual.**

Think somewhere between:

* chai / coffee
* and a more “ritual” drink you’d sip
* with a bit of a *feel* to it

Right now I’ve got 3 flavours:

* **Thai Milk** – creamy, cosy, slightly sweet
* **Bali Mocha** – cocoa + deeper unwind vibe
* **Malay Tea** – lighter, citrusy, fresh

A few early testers have reported:

* calmer, less scattered headspace
* a lighter, more relaxed body feel
* without the usual coffee jitters or energy drink crash.

I’m not here to do a sales pitch. I genuinely want **brutally honest feedback** from people who like trying new drinks or rituals. Taste, feel, what worked, what didn’t.

👉 **What I’m looking for:**

* You’re in / around **Dehradun**
* You actually *try* the drink properly (not just one random sip)
* You can tell me honestly:
   * how the taste felt
   * if you noticed any shift (even if it’s “nothing happened lol”)
   * whether you’d ever drink this again or not

I’m doing a small pilot batch for a handful of Reddit folks who are genuinely curious + can give good feedback, I’m happy to do a smaller “test circle” first.

If this sounds interesting drop a comment with your area and how you’d use it (study / work / gym / unwind)

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a basketball spectacle where Vanderbilt’s offense is a five-alarm fire and Western Kentucky’s defense is a soggy fire hose. On Wednesday, November 26, these two teams collide in the Bahamas, where the Commodores (+24 on the moneyline? More like +24 points of superiority) look to prove they’re not just a one-trick, 103-points-per-game ponie. Meanwhile, WKU hopes to avoid becoming the first team in history to lose by 17.5 points while wearing their “We’re Only Here for the Tourism” sweaters.

**The Numbers Don’t Lie (Well, They Do a Little, But Mostly They Scream)**  
Vanderbilt is the LeBron of college basketball right now—unstoppable, unselfish, and unapologetically scoring 103 points per game. With six players averaging double figures, including Tyler Tanner’s 16.0 PPG and Duke Miles’ 15.4, this team is like a buffet where every dish is “All You Can Eat Points.” Their +150 scoring differential? That’s the equivalent of WKU’s offense trying to compete with a team that only plays defense and calls it “sports.”

Western Kentucky, on the other hand, is the sports equivalent of a toaster oven that “technically” can broil. They average 90.3 PPG, led by Teagan Moore’s 18.3 and Grant Newell’s 14.8, but their defense is so porous, it makes a colander look like a vault. Last season, they allowed 74.8 PPG (263rd in the nation) while shooting a abysmal 32.9% from three (237th). If their three-pointers were a coffee machine, it’d need a “Service Now” sticker and a therapist.

**Parsing the Odds: A Toss-Up with a Tactical Twist**  
The odds for this West Midlands derby are as balanced as a tightrope walker on a breeze. At BetRivers, both teams sit at +270 (decimal 2.7), implying a 37% chance of victory for either side, while the draw hovers at +300 (33.3%). Across bookmakers, the spread bets are even tighter, with Birmingham City as slight favorites at some shops (e.g., BetUS lists them at -110) and West Brom others (Bovada lists them at -110). The total goals market leans toward Over 2.5 goals, with four of Birmingham’s last five games erupting into three-goal frenzies. But Under 2.5 is also tempting, given West Brom’s leaky defense (they’ve conceded 1.5 goals per game at home this season). In short, this is a match where the only sure thing is that neither side trusts their own keeper.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and a Dash of Drama**  
West Brom’s recent form is a rollercoaster that makes a soap opera look tame. After a 2-1 win over Oxford United—a team that plays soccer with the urgency of a sloth on a coffee break—they promptly collapsed 3-2 to Coventry City, squandering a two-goal lead like a toddler with a sandcastle. Their star striker, *insert name here*, remains sidelined with a “mystery muscle injury” (read: probably tripped over their own cleats during a pre-game ritual). Defensively, they’ve been as reliable as a umbrella in a hurricane, but their Hawthorns fortress has been a sanctuary lately, with just one loss in six home games against Birmingham.

Birmingham, meanwhile, is riding a three-game winning streak, including a 4-1 thrashing of Norwich that made their fans forget their team nearly folded in 2015. Their attack is as inconsistent as a reality TV star’s

Some of you have been asking for an updated version so here’s one. This time I’ve also broke it down by coffee subreddits and BuyItForLife.

This is part of my project to tinker with Reddit data and LLMs. Wanted to create something useful for the community while levelling up my coding chops.

The idea is to highlight which drip coffee makers got the most love. To be clear, most love =/= objectively best. But hopefully it’s a useful data point nonetheless, especially for those overwhelmed by the flood of options.

Obviously this is a very general list. It gets way more interesting when you slice and dice the data.

If you want to dig into the data I have an interactive list on my [project page.](https://redditrecs.com/drip-coffee-maker/)

You can explore the data, read the comments, filter by price, subreddits, brew strength, or filter for comments about taste, ease of cleaning, using for daily commute, office, entertaining etc. Disclaimer - the page has some affiliate links. You don’t have to use them, though they they help fund the analyses.

From the beginning of the relationship I was lied to about various things including bodycount, this will be important later as this was my first physical romantic interaction past a kiss. 

The first events that occurred were the fact that she was consistently going out to bars for the first 3 months of our relationship specifically to wingman her friend, at the time I was fairly immature and blindly trusted her since I had assumptions that this was normal in a relationship, these bar trips essentially consisted of her and her friend at a communal table where her friend would talk to one guy and she would entertain the rest, allegedly she always rejected advances however I have no reason to believe this as she admitted that her feelings for me weren't particularly deep until at least 2.5 months in.

Next there was her refusal to remove previous dates and talking stages from her social media, she claimed that she thought this was normal due to her last relationship however from the beginning she was consistently lying about who certain people were, what the interaction was and avoiding actually removing them.

This culminated in her screen sharing a show one day, checking WhatsApp and me seeing a message from a guy she had dated which she replied to about a month into our relationship, this is where it all starts to fall apart since I later found out that was not the only message.

The lies continued as she finally admitted around 5 months into our relationship that her body count was 4X what she had originally claimed, with 3 one night stands in a short period. This is especially important as I wanted to wait to have sex and we finally did just before this, my first time, a decision I would not have made in light of this situation.

Many small lies continued in the weeks after me finding everything out but for the sake of time I won't go into them.

Then in April it finally came to a head where she gave me an ultimatum that if I brought it up again she would leave, on the day of this she had coffee with her only guy friend and cried to him about the relationship, even in light of all her friends telling her that its clear he liked her.

After this and some more conversations everything levelled out, she cut off some bad influences and we have had a good-ish last 7 months. I find myself now in a situation where I still haven't got over what happened and I am no longer physically attracted to her.

The issue is that she is my best friend, we speak for hours a day and she wants us to build a life together, we do have a great emotional connection but all the other factors make it impossible for me to come to a conclusion, we have 2 trips planned imminently and I worry they're going to draw me back in again when I have a feeling in my gut that this isn't the right relationship for me.

I still love her massively in a platonic way but since we are LDR it would be a clean break and I would essentially lose a best friend who gives me security going forward.

TLDR; After betrayal and loss of attraction, should I stay with my partner because we have a strong friendship in the relationship, or should I cut my losses, breakup and grieve?",2,1764169191.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False
1p79usj,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodstoving/comments/1p79usj/long_runs_maybe_a_competition/,Long runs? Maybe a competition?,"Interested in what your longest run continuous burns have been. I've had my wood stove for 3 years now, for various reasons the first two years we haven't been at home much so it only got maybe a couple of dozen burns per year.

This year we are at home likely until April, been burning since early October a bit, but its full on winter now. I've read a lot of threads on this reddit related to not burning too hot, maintenance, etc, and I feel like I've been doing all the right things.

I'm interested in how many continuous days you've had a fire running? By continuous I mean at worst the fire burns down but there is still enough coals to start it up again without using any sort of ignition. Like you can put in some scrap paper and a bit of kindling and the fire is going again within minutes. With a medium sized load before bed, say last wood on at 11pm, there is enough at 6:30am when I get up for coffee to start it again. Typically I throw wood on, and by the time my coffee pod is brewed the fire is on again. My wife is at home most days, but if I put a medium load of wood on when I leave for work at 8am, then just top it up at lunch, I'm good again until about 7pm when we get back from all the kids activities. In all we're probably putting wood on 5 times a day. We try to put on just a bit of wood otherwise the house gets too hot.

Right now I'm on about day 4 which I'm sure isn't much, but yeah, tell me how many days you've run your wood stove!

I live in the Northwest Territories, so winter here will be cold enough to have a fire until at least late february, probably into mid-March before it gets too warm out. I'm sure I won't run that long continuous, but this feels like a challenge now, lol!",4,1764169139.0,woodstoving,3,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **FC Lugano vs. FC Sion: A Swiss Super League Showdown Where Rain Has Already Played Its Part**

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
The odds for this clash are as clear as a Swiss alpine lake—well, minus the rain that once turned a pitch into a swamp. FC Lugano is the favorite here, with implied probabilities hovering around **54-57%** (odds: 1.8–1.85). FC Sion? They’re the underdog, with a **22-24%** chance (odds: 3.95–4.2). The draw? A tidy 28-29% (odds: 3.4–3.6). For context, Sion’s odds are about as likely to win this game as my Uncle Emil is to admit he’s wrong about his homemade sausages.

**Digesting the News: Form, Fortunes, and Forgotten Cup Setbacks**  
Lugano’s recent form is a Swiss Army knife—sharp, reliable, and capable of carving up opponents. They’ve won **6 of 7 matches**, including a steak of 18 points from 21 available in their last seven games. Their defense? A well-oiled watchtower, having gone **three games without conceding**. Manager Mattia Croci-Torti deserves a medal (or at least a better coffee budget) for keeping the ship steady amid four managerial changes in the league this season. But let’s not forget their **embarrassing Swiss Cup exit** to third-division Cham—proof that even Swiss chocolate can sometimes taste like chalk.

FC Sion’s profile is murkier. The provided data is as sparse as a piste in July, but their odds suggest they’re the team equivalent of a fondue pot left unattended—unstable and prone to burning everyone. Their recent results? A **“modest run”** (translation: not great) and a schedule that includes struggling teams l

He paid for my omelette (like $12), which I appreciated. Afterward, we walked around it started to rain, so I suggested we sit in Starbucks and, since he had paid for breakfast, I offered to cover the coffee.

He asked me to order him the $9 Frappuccino for himself, and I paid for both our drinks.

After I sat down with both our drinks, he pulled up his Starbucks account and casually showed me that he has over **7k stars**. From what I understand, that’s the equivalent of around 70 regular coffees or about 35 specialty drinks.

I’m not mad that I paid because I did offer, but it felt a little tacky to let me pay when he had enough points to cover it several times over without even spending money. Especially after actually showing off how many he had. Meanwhile, I have fewer than 100 points as I don't have a habit of accumulating stars.

We’re both 30, both employed, and this isn’t really about the money. It’s more about the social etiquette of it. If the roles were reversed and I had that many points, I would have just used them and said, “Let’s use my stars.”

I've started to learn French on my own for the past 4-ish months. I'll probably eventually cut this down, but I've been experimenting with what I like in terms of learning. 

I just discovered French in Action, so I've been working through that. I also am working through the first Grammaire Progressive book. I was using Assimil before, and will read a chapter once or twice a week still.

I use the Mauril app along with Anki to help with retention. I also have found some other sources recently to help with that possibly (like Linguno). And on Saturday mornings I use Kwiziq (along with watching the French in action vid and reading the news in A2 French).

And when I go for walks I'll listen to Coffee Break French. 

I feel as though I have a good basis. I also just started going to French zoom sessions online for beginners/intermediates weekly. And my girlfriend is French so I can bug her sometimes for help/to talk. 

I've debated taking a class in person at some point, but I find the flexibility of solo learning great. Do people find in-person classes that helpful - should I still consider it? 

And is there anything else I should be looking to do or grab? I know of things like RocketLanguage and Pimsleur but I feel as though the grammar book and FIA should hopefully give me structure instead. Does an actual course help a lot?

Our neighborhood shops, eateries, makers, and service pros are the heart of our economy and the soul of our streets. Every dollar spent at a small business sends about 68 cents right back into our community… that makes a lot of local cents 🙂

We see the impact of small business support: owners who know your name, first jobs for our teens, storefronts that light up Main Street and our city hotspots. With this proclamation, we are inviting everyone in Fitchburg to turn one day of support into a season-long habit.

Here’s how we can help our small businesses thrive:

✅ Shop small, eat local… gifts, services, coffee runs, holiday catering

✅ Bring a friend… make it a stroll downtown or a hop across our districts

✅ Share the love… post a photo of your purchase and shout out the business

✅ Buy gift cards… perfect for teachers, coworkers, and stocking stuffers

To our business owners, thank you for investing in Fitchburg. To our neighbors, thank you for choosing local and helping entrepreneurs grow, hire, and keep our city vibrant.

1p79not,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p79not,More photos of the greenhouse & pots have been moved in!,"I posted about a week ago of a greenhouse that needs a bit of help in my backyard. I recently moved in and was hoping to get some suggestions on the first things that need to get fixed.

With the shelves and a couple of the roof framing aspects needing my immediate attention I’m looking for suggestions on the next plan. 

In my last post someone suggested focusing on making it a cold structure and seeing what I can grow first in there without the addition of fixing the electricity for a heater.

My dream is definitely to make this a tropical climate greenhouse and a nook for coffee in the morning!

When I used to work in the office my mornings were pure chaos. I'd burn toast, forget my keys, sprint to the bus like an idiot and still somehow show up 4 mins late with my hair doing whatever it wanted.



Now that I’m home... my mornings got \*too\* smooth. Like suspiciously smooth. I wake up, make coffee, sit down, open laptop... and suddenly it’s 11am and I have no memory of the last 3 hours. Not in a scary way, more like my brain is on autopilot mode and forgot to notify me about existing.



Then last Thursday my smart watch buzzed with the lil ""youve been still for 180 min"" alert and I legit jumped because I swear I thought I had been working for like 20 min. It was such a weird ""where the hell did my morning go"" moment. I feel productive, my tasks get done, no issues, but the sense of time is just... scrambled. I even put a plant next to my desk hoping it would be some kind of natural clock but it just stares at me judgingly.



Is this like a remote work rite of passage or am I slowly turning into one of those guys who live in a haze of endless Teams calls and refilled mugs. Anyone else losing track of time in a kinda creepy but also kinda nice way?",2,1764168598.0,remotework,3,0.58,False

My parents are good friends with the server, and she kept bringing over cocktails - when I said ""oh I don't drink,"" she pretty much ignored me for the rest of the night and forgot to refill my mocktail. Culminated in her bringing over after-dinner shots for my parents and sister while I sipped my water. 

Got back to the condo and my Dad starts making manhattans, we play board games but by round two I'm getting tired of their raised voices and repetitive stories and inability to take their turn. I went to bed before 9pm just to get away from it all.

I admit, I had some FOMO. 2-3 years ago, I would've been drinking right along with them. I felt like the odd one out with my seltzer and blackberry juice. 

But you know what? This morning, I woke up at 6:15am and went for a run in the early morning fog. I saw a box turtle crawling along the road and helped it into the grass. There were funny bumper stickers (shoutout to the truck with ""I <3 STRIPPERS"" and ""This Machine Kills Fascists"" on either side) and neat houses with cute decorations. I sweated my ass off, got back, took a shower and made coffee and breakfast. Had the condo to myself.

And I am so grateful I stayed sober.

I feel calm and peaceful, if a little tired. I'm going to get some work done and then spend the afternoon lounging by the pool reading Dungeon Crawler Carl and eating fritos.

1p79iva,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p79iva,How to pinned to a cork board with Nano Banana Pro?,"I’ve been testing a fun new storytelling format in Nano Banana Pro.

This prompts turning entire movies or books into a cork-board of Polaroid moments. It creates this mix of mystery-board energy + nostalgia that looks incredibly cinematic.

Here’s the exact prompt I used:

**Prompt:**

""Create an image about ""\[FILM\_OR\_NOVEL\]"" retold through a series of Polaroid photos pinned to a cork board. Each photo captures a key moment, with simple captions below. Arrange the photos in a loosely chronological path across the board, using colored strings to connect events and characters. Light the scene warmly to evoke nostalgia. Include incidental details, coffee cup rings, paper clips, handwritten notes, for authenticity.""

[](https://x.com/umesh_ai/status/1993247403995283687/photo/1)

Nano Banana Pro handles the layout really well — it keeps the Polaroids readable, the string connections clean, and the whole board feels like a detective-style memory map of the story.

This format works AMAZING for:  
• sci-fi movies like Interstaller   
• detective stories  
• romance plots  
• anything with a timeline or character connections

If you want, I can also write a version specifically for:  
\- TV series  
\- video game storylines  
\- true crime cases  
\- historical events

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1p79f8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/1p79f8m/i_made_a_cooking_rpg_to_fix_my_reallife_kitchen/,I made a cooking RPG to fix my real-life kitchen problems,"I built myself a chaotic little cooking game because apparently the only way to stop me from letting produce die in my crisper is to threaten myself with quests.



I’m a low-level home cook wannabe. I love food, I love trying things, I buy fancy ingredients… and then forget they exist. My friends raid my pantry like it’s a tomb and go “girl this expired a year ago,” and I just shrug because I *did* have noble intentions, I just didn’t have the attention span or skills to use them on time.



So I’ve been using AI to generate random recipes based on whatever’s in my kitchen. And honestly? It worked. It taught me what flavors vibe together and how not to create desert-dry chicken in the air fryer. Cooking the results felt like a tiny adulting win every time.



BUT every time I asked AI to regenerate a dish I liked, I’d get a totally different version because I missed an ingredient or changed the vibe prompt. Nothing was consistent. My kitchen was chaos, and I wanted order. So… I accidentally built a whole culinary RPG.



Here’s how it works:

* I have a virtual pantry where every item has a real-life expiration timer. You “buy” ingredients, the system gives them a shelf life, and using them reduces their uses instead of quantity (because quantity is a lie in this game).
* If something is expiring soon, it screams at me first thing when I open the app. If I cook it, I get bonus coins. If I let it rot… I get punished like the irresponsible goblin I am.
* Recipes start with ✨ vibes ✨. I can either
   * generate a dish based on what’s already in my pantry, or
   * draw three “recipe cards” like tarot and pick one to adapt to what I have.
   * But indecision is expensive. Every reshuffle costs more coins until I’m broke and forced to commit like a real adult.
* The only way to progress is to *actually* cook the recipes. No cheating. I can’t upload old photos — I must take the pic on the spot. A food-vision AI checks if the ingredients are actually in the dish. If the challenge is “use coffee” and I plate chicken curry? No coins for me.
* There are mini Masterchef-style challenges too: use one featured ingredient, recreate an AI-plated dish, clear expiring items in one go, etc.
* Recipes earn coins based on the rarest ingredient used. And they “level up” the more I cook them.
* I can also set servings and get macros… but this only gets useful once my virtual pantry is stocked. So I’m grinding like a kitchen gremlin right now.



Weirdly enough, playing this while doing real life feels like I’m going through cozy side quests instead of chores. And remembering I have a wilting lettuce at home has never felt more like an in-game alert.



# Before I add even more chaos, I wanna ask:

* How do you keep yourself from wasting ingredients?
* Any fun cooking challenges I can add that work for one player?
* Do you like gamified chores, or does it feel like too much brainpower?",1,1764168053.0,IndieGaming,1,0.6,False

Obviously, since it goes with a territory of ADHD getting things done has always been very difficult for me. Medication is somewhat helping with it.

I was the kid whose teachers scolded for shoving papers into my bag. For having a messy desk. My mom punished me for never being able to clean my room or do chores. I used to have major melt downs as a kid of sobbing and screaming from this issue. It was awful. 

Because of this I’m very sensitive to people asking me to do things. I don’t mind completing tasks at work and if someone requests something from me nicely I’ll have no issue getting it done. Like “Do you mind doing the dishes today?” Doesn’t bother me. But “Hey can you get the dishes done?” Makes me automatically defensive. And “Hey, do the dishes” makes me see red. It feels like a personal attack against me. 

I used to legitimately despise my in laws when we lived with them because they’d just demand things from me the “wrong way”. Like they’d see me making coffee and say “make me a cup too” and I felt like I’d been slapped in the face. Or if they said to mop the floors in a too direct way it would make me feel so angry it was hard to not want to scream at them. I used to rage to my husband about how unbearable it was that they’d do this and he’d never understand why I was so angry. But it just felt so much like a personal attack. 

I struggle with getting tasks done. I put things off until the last minute. If I have directions on a task, I will start to read the directions like for instance I’ll follow a recipe and then halfway through decide that I don’t need directions telling me what to do and that I can figure it out on my own. 

My sister recently gently asked me if I have PDA and looking into it… I wonder if I do. Maybe people weren’t actually targeting me or being mean to me when they would tell me to do things. Maybe it’s something that I need to work on. 

I don’t mean to be rude or a bad person. I was just reacting to what I perceived to be a threat or an insult

Yes i will absolutely buy Steam Frame even tho I have a quest 3 and mainly do wireless PCVR, i'll still use my Quest 3 for travels and other things... Steam Frame feels like a big upgrade from quest 3 even if hardware wise similar...

Quest 3 is nice and all but it really isn't aimed for gamers, its more Social media and productivity nowadays and feels like they pretty much given up on it and moved on to AR Glasses instead, which i was tempted to get but then realized i really do not need that....  
OH and how many of us with quest 3 has been waiting for over 2 years for the pinned augmented windows and whatever else they promised? And all the other weird issues with their updates like 6ghz band not being available for a while...

With steam frame coming it's actually pushing me to finally do the expensive upgrade of my entire network with 10gbe and wifi7 which has been hard rationalize due to cost but actually kind of needed with all the transfers between servers and PC's...   
I mean some would probably see this as an negative but this isn't even needed simply because of the Dongle that does come with the headset but a good push for me to just finally do that, So cheers on spending 1000$+ on network upgrades :D 

Even if Steam Frame would cost about 1000$ it still would be cheaper than what i spent on accessories for my Quest 3 and i think most of us was expecting it to be 1000-1200$ and now it might be half of that, We can't be sure if they meant ""Index headset + controllers"" or ""Full index kit"" when they said they aiming for lower cost than Index... But also unexpected twist is AI ruining the prices of Hardware parts so who the heck knows now, But since there was already rumors about it being on mass production about 6 months ago? They might of already stocked up on all needed parts for it before the price skyrocketing...

**Accessories i've bought for my Quest 3 512gb:** 

* Dedicated Wifi6e router \~180-220$
* 2x Link Cables from 2 different companies (no idea what i paid) guesstimation 20-50$ 
* 3 Different straps until finally ending up on BoboVR S3 Pro with hotswap batteries \~180-250$ 
* 1 Kiwi batterypack Before BoboVR \~30-50$ 
* BoboVR 1x Hotswap Battery + Charging dock \~120-150$ 
* BoboVR Facial interface \~30-50$ 
* Magtube pro gunstock /w grips \~200-250$ 
* VirtualDesktop (software) was the easiest and best solution with Wireless, SteamLink and QuestLink nothing but constant issues... \~10-20$ 
* Broke left controller. replacement cost 80-120$

So as you can see i poured in a lot into my VR and probably would of been more if i didnt stop myself :D

And lets be honest the Meta official accessories were and are absolute garbage and expensive...

But anyways, The steam frame is aimed for gamers and having separate antennas for controllers, PC Linking(wifi6e dongle) and Wifi7(Also use as PC Link i believe) etc. is HUUUUUGE...   
And it basically Includes everything i felt like i had to buy to make wireless somewhat comfortable and easy... Steam Frame comes with most of that out-of-the-box, Huge win for all new people coming to VR, No 100+ Tutorials on how to make the best adjustments for your VR Headset...

And correct me if im wrong but aren't most VR Headsets(wire) like BSB2 using DisplayPort 1.4 which technically has lower bandwidth than Wifi7, So in ""Perfect"" condition could be on equal footing with Wired VR nowadays, Maybe not as stable but a helluva faster than wifi6e... supports 4k120fps stream etc. but pointless since 70% of steam users can't play that high resolution without upscaling, DLSS or framegen... Yes feel free to bash me on this, Just dont downvote :D

But also what excites me most is the compatibility layers Steam Frame will have across multiple platforms like android etc. So it will be great Standalone device, Better optimized than Meta since Steams main focus is GAMING!   


Too put it in layman terms, so its easier for some people to understand(Please do correct me if wrong).  
Parallel comparison from Phone app developers, Steam is basically putting iOS and Android together so developers don't have to develop for each OS separately (at least used to be), which meant extra work and some didn't bother porting from Android to iOS or vice versa.

So it will be easier for Game developers to create their games with the Steam ecosystem in mind rather than different ones, at this current moment i don't believe we have any Phone apps or games in steam store but this could also be a future addition i believe.  
I don't think it will be like this off the bat, but i do see this as a possible long-term goal for steam.  
Which will make it much easier for developers to make their apps more compatible on multiple platforms, or so i think(im delusional)

And you know what i think will be the absolute biggest win for those that only do Standalone currently on Quest devices? You will finally be able to run discord a lot easier on steam frame, I mean you can already have it on your Steam Deck i believe without any big issues(Don't own steam deck but quick google says u can load it easily... I have few friends who mainly play on standalone cause always issues with the Meta app etc. they've gone through so many different ways of sideloading Discord, or Using the browser on the quest etc. None really worked great, and if they worked great that was short lived because some update would mess something up or yeah just generally broke down randomly...  
Quest 3 to officially get an Discord app next year, a little to late if u ask me...

But of course i also have some concerns about Steam Frame being on Linux, but hopefully will just force Developers to actually start making more Linux compatible games and actually spend a bit more money on developing and less money on AI crap they keep trying to make us accept...  
And by that i mean concerns about anti-cheat and Developers mainly not giving love to the linux community etc.  
I've been wanting to switch over to Linux for years but i aint in that mental capacity to troubleshoot everything nowadays, Windows is still just easier to use in that sense on desktop.  
Not that it really matters if i will mainly use Steam Frame for PCVR but for the future it will matter a great deal.

**Someone please update me and correct me on this as it has been a decade or two I actually read about Vulkan API and DirectX API....**  
And i mean if SteamOS becomes a huge success, Developers might actually just start supporting Linux more and that means more Vulkan API usage(has come long way since AMD days), More native support for Vulkan API could be absolutely huge performance wise.  
atm we have Proton, wine and other translation drivers to use DirectX(DXVK).  
DirectX is known for having a big overhead and resource heavy but **STABLE** while Vulkan has been smaller overhead and less resource heavy but not as stable as DirectX

In the end, I think Steam Frame will be the greatest thing to happen in the VR Community and it has been a lot easier for me to convince some of my none VR friends to get Steam Frame, Simply because of their marketing of it that it can be used as a ""Steam Deck"" basically... Play your Flatscreen games on steam frame, Which most of us already knew we could do with most of our VR Headsets :D but it does give the Steam Frame a much wider audience than just a niche VR headset...

And i mean if Sony and Microsoft implement a Steam third party store on their devices and allows Steam Frame use on their devices that could mean a huge win for all parties ESPECIALLY us gamers... but i mean thats a lot of hopium right there :D but not impossible considering seeing ""fake news maybe?"" about xbox basically asking Valve to release SteamOS for consoles and other platforms.. Honestly don't really care about consoles even tho i have a PS5, but if Sony and Microsoft would start making SteamOS machines or make some form of Steam Library connection to consoles... then that's a huge win for us all... But yes that is hopium right there :P

One hope i have is that Valve would make a hotswap battery in back, similar to Bobovr S3 pro headstrap cause i doubt very much the battery time will be enough for my 6-15hour straight gaming i've done :D We will most likely see third party making this but i hope for it to be straight on launch :D

I don't see a reason to actually ""Upgrade"" to 4k Micro-OLED or whaever other VR Headsets are using to sell their 1200-3000$ Headsets with wires...  
Now i admit i have never tried any of those so i can't say that the Displays are so much better cause better dark pixels or whaever, I was tempted with Bigscreen beyond, but thankfully i didnt have a phone that could take the 3D Image of my fugly face, cause it would of been an expensive thing that i might of hated simply because of it being wired :D My first VR headset was a Oculus Rift S, which i recently gave away(with a stick drift on left controller, which made them hate me even more), but hey it was free for them so... And i do remember the pain of using cable back then even if you would stand still on the spot, and i never invested in a pulley system etc as i was less and less excited about it...

And i truly believe the future of VR should be Wireless and with Steam Frame it will show other companies that its a big possibility and the headset doesn't have to weigh 500g+ on the front alone for it to be possible :D And as Wifi7 is become more standard and cheaper i don't see why not. And for those that really are stuck on wanting 4k Panels or Micro-OLED etc. Start nagging BSB and other companies to do it, Since Wifi7 should be able to compete with DisplayPort IN A SENSE, Some games might still require that ZERO-Latency which you will ever only get with Wired solutions. But i do agree with some that they could of added a DisplayPort or alternative Wired solution from the get go so it would of been an option for alot of people doing those Sim games...

For me Steam ecosystem has a very long-term vision that involves mainly gaming unlike Meta even tho i was super excited about my Quest 3 but since then my hopium for their ecosystem has crashed and burned and i don't see them being able to compete with Valve or other platforms in the VR space for that much longer when it comes to Gaming, Productivity and other things they will be ahead of and with their Hand Tracking which is a pretty big gimmick in my opinion and not a big fan for it in lots of different ways... But hoping others will adopt it as well as it can be a nice option for multiple applications...

  
So all-in-all I think Valve will take VR and gaming to next level and we'll hopefully see more developers tipping their toes into the ecosystem and start making more flatscreen+VR capable games, Big shoutout to ""Flatscreen to VR Modding community"" which have already done this on so many Flatscreen games already, and ofcourse UEVR as well <3 There might be more out there but these are the 2 communities i personally know about.

TLDR;

\* Steam Frame is an upgrade from Quest 3 in every single way, not side grade but upgrade...  
Faster network to compete with Wired bandwidth(Wifi6e Dongle or Wifi7), Eye tracking for foveated streaming, Lower latency than any current **Wireless** VR headset, SteamOS(no more Meta store and ads), Better controllers out-of-the-box (I think?), No idea about the tracking comparison wise but my impressions are similar to Quest3 default controllers but better button layout, Also a bit sad no Base station option as i still believe its best tracking solution(which i dont even or have ever used).  
\* No need for lot of accessories like dedicated Wifi routers compared to Meta Quest 3 or other VR Headsets that can do Wireless PCVR.  
\* Compatibility layers allowing most or all platforms...  
\* Marketing for a bigger gaming audience (Mobile and handhelds etc.)  
\* The possibilities with SteamOS and its ecosystem is massive and hopefully forcing developers to give Linux more love and make it easier for them to develop on multi-platforms.  
\* Potential reach to console developers except Nintendo(i mean you know why...) and combine forces in certain ways to get third party store for Steam(Yeah quite delusional this one i know)...

He became my new routine in no time at all. The center of my weekend plans. The first and last voice I heard most days. Texting constantly. Checking in at lunch break. Calling him on my way home. It was such a contrast to the way my ex-husband had ignored my messages and curved my phone calls. B made me feel cared for and connected. Called me 5 times a day sometimes, like prayers, to hear my voice, to tell me something funny, to say he missed me. So the new silence is noticeable. 

I try not to replay memories. But certain things just keep floating to the surface in my mind. His big, dark, serious eyes when he told me on our third or fourth day, ""We both know what this is, and where we're going."" Laughing naked at stupid movies in bed and brushing oil into his hair. Him bringing me a glass of cold water and a multivitamin in the morning with a forehead kiss. Feeling more free and loved and myself than I ever remember. The way he slid into me in the dark like our bodies were formed to fit together. The voice in my heart that growled, ""Mine"" the last time he laid his his head on my chest and sighed into my skin. And how touching that feeling felt like a live wire; how fast I mentally backed away and told myself, NO. 

He has a favorite coffee cup in my cupboard, he called my bed ""ours,"" and referred to his side. He has a toothbrush in my bathroom.

Yesterday I cleaned out my fridge like I do every week, and it happened to be time to throw out all the things we had bought last time he was here. Then the peach jalapeño jam from July and ""Good Luck, Babe"" on the Spotify stole my breath. I had to turn the music off and sit down while the spike of pain from my stomach up into my throat receded. I want to laugh at myself, but it still hurts too much. 

Room by room, I gathered up all the odds and ends he'd left scattered around my house over the past 5 months: a beard comb, a band t-shirt, some socks, a charcuterie platter. I kept the souvenir he brought me from the big concert he was so excited about. I made a mental note to ask him for my house key back. When I asked him when I could drop off his things, he ignored the question and instead sent  me a picture of the pie he baked for Thanksgiving. I like to think that means something. That it hurts him, too.",1,1764166670.0,Diary,0,1.0,False
