Can this be fixed? Did I go overboard?,"I (F 30) have been paying the bills since my boyfriend lost his job two months ago. My boyfriend (M 27) couldn’t keep a job for more than 6 months at a time since we got together. He got fired three times over the course of 3 years. 

He also came from a well-off family so he has high taste. I, on the other hand came from a poor family. I worked my ass off to get where I am right now. While I am okay with sharing, I’m just too tired of having to pay everything. It’s a cycle: he gets a job, gets fired or quit, and I’m left to pay for everything when he can’t.

We also moved to a new city to save money. I figured I could do more here since the living cost is lower from where I came from. My business didn’t do well so I decided to make this move 8 months ago. He willingly moved with me. He also used up his trust fund to put a deposit for a place and sustain us for two months. But a few months ago, my business started doing well again. He got fired a month ago and I have been paying for most of our bills, if not everything. There were also times when he’d borrow money from me. Up to date, he owes me over 10,000 USD. I also told him to sell everything he gave me just so he could at least sustain himself. He refused and got a little mad at me when I said I wanted to pawn the jewelry and sell the gadgets he gave. 

It was never a 50-50 situation with us, though. For the last four years, I have been paying most of the bills. He’d contribute when he has a job, but I’d always cover most of the bills. He also cooks, but doesn’t like cleaning. Because of this, I recently hired a maid. I didn’t wanna argue over the chores because I’m always tired of working (even though I work from home). He cooks and would help me with work from time to time, but he is not actively looking for a job now. 

I am so confused right now because he never did this. We had arguments, but he didn’t become this violent. He never laid a hand on me for the four years we have been together. It breaks my heart this happened during Christmas. We had a fun night at my parents’ yesterday and I am just so hurt right now. We have been open with each other and I brought this up with him many times, but it’s always the same cycle. He also refuses to tell his parents he’s been having a hard time keeping a job and that I’ve been covering for him. 

Please give me honest advice because I don’t know what to do. I couldn’t tell my family and friends because they like him and I don’t want to badmouth him about something like this. He has been loyal, honest, patient, and sincere with me. The only issue I had with our relationship was I felt like I have to cover most of the bills when he doesn’t have a job. Idk if I was just too attached to the money because I grew up poor, and he didn’t. Can this be fixed? Did I go overboard by saying he lives off of me? 

Feel free to ask questions for more context as well. I know it’s Christmas and I really appreciate any replies I’ll get here.

Seems our little bundle reckons themselves the second coming of some guy who apparently liked wine, fish and bread, a long time ago. 

We're not religious but do celebrate the family side of Xmas as we grew up in catholic households. One suggestion was to celebrate the ""half birthday"", so June 25th. Seems a bit complicated but could be fun to have nice weather and your friends available. 

Another was to do gifts from Santa and us, anyone else who wanted to do birthday gifts could just donate money to an account, which over time would generate interest and be a good starting point in life when it's time for the little one to step out into the big wide world.

Any other ideas?

Hello all! Merry Christmas,
I got my mother a beginner espresso machine for Christmas this morning as she’s been wanting one for years. I got her the Swan Retro Espresso machine as I saw online it was an affordable beginner machine. It makes the coffee fine we’ve tried it out a couple of times this morning to get the hang of it but we noticed after a while that there’s water leaking from the water tank. We’ve tried to put the tank on the machine a couple of times but no matter what it keeps leaking. It’s brand new out of the box and has only been used to make 3 coffees. Any help?

Very sparingly I see her around just from assossicated people groups and being in a smaller city. There is a lot I like about her and she knows I like her. After seeing her at a coffee shop February 2024 I messaged her asking if she is talking to anyone and she said, “Hey! Actually I am rn. Thank you for being upfront with me. Unfortunately this isn’t the best time for me to consider anything new haha.” I replied that is understandable and thanked her for an answer. Since then I have only commented to an Instagram story in July which she didn’t respond.    

Fast forward 10 months later to yesterday, I saw her at the same coffee shop and she was very friendly and we had small talk about what we are doing for Christmas. Mind you, I think I have improved my looks slightly since she last saw me. As she walked out she said goodbye with a smile and wave, I said to have a good Christmas. I don’t see any signs of her being with anyone on social media, (I didn’t last time either).

1hlzlgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1hlzlgr/timmys_new_roommates_part_5/,timmy's new roommates part 5,"Over the next few weeks, my life fell into a strange routine. It wasn’t something we ever discussed or agreed upon—it just happened, quietly and insidiously. I stopped thinking of my time as mine. My days were shaped by Brandy’s needs, her schedule, and her unspoken expectations.  
At first, it was little things. One morning, Brandy breezed past me in the kitchen, her heels clicking sharply against the tile. She paused just long enough to toss a casual comment over her shoulder. “I’m wearing the red dress tomorrow night. Make sure it’s pressed. Oh, and check my heels. I think one of them has a scuff.”  
I barely registered my own response—a faint, “Okay.” By the time I realized what I’d agreed to, she was already out the door, leaving me to figure out how to add this task to my already crowded evening.  
Her wardrobe became my responsibility. Every morning, I found myself anticipating her needs—mentally cataloging her outfits and preparing whatever she’d likely want. If she mentioned a date night or an event, I would make sure the dress was pressed, her shoes were polished, and any accessories were ready. She never thanked me or acknowledged the effort. It was simply expected, like everything else.  
One afternoon, Brandy’s frustration with me hit a new peak. Her sharp voice rang through the house.  
“Timmy! Get up here—now!”  
I hurried upstairs to find her standing in the master bathroom, her hands planted on her hips and her expression furious. She gestured to her vanity, which was its usual chaotic mess. Brushes were scattered across the surface, a foundation bottle had tipped over and left a smear on the counter, and half-open compacts were piled haphazardly on one side.  
“This is unacceptable,” she snapped, pointing at the mess. “I couldn’t find my eyeliner this morning because everything was buried under this disaster. How am I supposed to get ready like this?”  
“I… uh, I didn’t realize—” I stammered, unsure of what to say.  
“Of course, you didn’t,” she interrupted, her tone icy. “But I don’t want to ever see it like this again. Do you understand me? Everything should be lined up. No caps left off, no smears, no clutter. If I leave it a mess, it’s your job to fix it.”  
“Yes, Brandy,” I mumbled, feeling my cheeks burn.  
She sighed dramatically, turning back to the mirror and smoothing her hair. “Honestly, Timmy, you should have known. I shouldn’t have to tell you these things.”  
From that moment on, it became yet another part of my routine. Every time Brandy finished getting ready, I would quietly slip into the bathroom to restore order. Brushes were cleaned and placed neatly in their holder, compacts and palettes were stacked in perfect alignment, and every bottle was capped and arranged by size. I wiped the counter meticulously, ensuring it was spotless before leaving.  
She never brought it up again, but her subtle inspections became impossible to miss. I noticed the way her eyes flicked over the surface each morning. If everything was in its proper place, she didn’t say a word. If anything was out of order, her displeasure was palpable, even if she didn’t call me out directly.  
Weekends became the clearest sign of how much my role had changed. I stopped thinking about making plans for myself. The idea of going out or doing something I enjoyed felt… wrong. Brandy never explicitly forbade it, but her presence—and her control—was enough. If she was home, she always found ways to keep me busy. Laundry, errands, reorganizing her closet, fixing something she’d casually mentioned earlier in the week. If she and Trent went out, I stayed home, tethered by an unspoken rule that I needed to be available.  
One Friday evening, Trent and Brandy were heading out for dinner. As Brandy descended the stairs, she looked radiant, as always. Her dress hugged her figure perfectly, and the heels I’d polished earlier clicked against the hardwood. She paused at the bottom, inspecting her reflection in the hall mirror.  
“Hmm,” she said, adjusting a strand of her hair. “You forgot to clean the back of this necklace, Timmy. It’s smudged. Don’t let it happen again.”  
“Sorry, Brandy,” I mumbled, already making a mental note to check every piece of jewelry next time.  
She glanced at Trent, who was sprawled on the couch, scrolling through his phone. “Ready, babe?” she asked, her voice suddenly sweet.  
“Yeah,” he replied, standing and stretching. “Let’s go.”  
As they walked to the door, Brandy glanced over her shoulder, her tone sharp once more. “Don’t leave. I might need something when we get back.”  
Her words cut through me, blunt and final. I hesitated for a moment, staring at her, a 42-year-old man taking orders from this 20-year-old woman as if it was the most natural thing in the world. She raised an eyebrow, waiting for my response.  
“Yes, Brandy,” I replied quietly, hating how automatic it sounded. The dismissal in her smirk was palpable as she turned back to Trent and stepped out into the cool evening.  
As the door closed, I felt the weight of her command settle over me. I was a grown man, perfectly capable of going out or doing as I pleased. But the reality was, I wouldn’t. It wasn’t just her words that kept me home—it was the expectation, the quiet power she held over every corner of my life.  
I sat in the living room that evening, staring blankly at the TV, my mind restless. Outside, life went on without me, and upstairs, her jewelry box sat waiting for its next inspection.  
  
There were moments when I wondered how I’d fallen into this role. But the thought always faded, replaced by the need to keep everything running smoothly. Brandy’s expectations—once overwhelming—had become normal. Anticipating her needs, ironing her dresses, organizing her vanity—it all felt inevitable. My weekends revolved around her schedule. My life wasn’t mine anymore, but I didn’t know how to take it back—or if I even could.  
Work was my sanctuary. My cubicle, small and simple, gave me a sense of purpose and competence. At the office, I was respected for my precision and skill, even if I wasn’t a star like Trent. It was a break from the quiet humiliation of being a live-in servant to my roommate’s 20-year-old girlfriend. When I sat at my desk, surrounded by files and to-do lists, I could almost forget the way my evenings and weekends had become dominated by Brandy’s demands.  
One Friday, as the week was winding down, the senior partners emerged from their offices, calling everyone together for an announcement. Trent stood among them, looking as confident and composed as ever. He’d been crushing it at work, landing huge clients, and the partners were all too aware of his talent.  
The managing partner beamed as he addressed the group. “Ladies and gentlemen, we are thrilled to announce that Trent has been made partner—the youngest in our firm’s history at just 27.”  
Applause broke out across the office, and Trent smiled graciously, shaking hands with the senior partners. I clapped too, genuinely happy for him despite the quiet pang of inferiority that crept into my chest. He was a star, and I couldn’t deny that he deserved this.  
After the announcement, I approached him in the hallway. “Congratulations, Trent,” I said, offering a small smile.  
“Thanks, buddy,” he replied, clapping me on the shoulder. “Means a lot coming from you.”  
I wasn’t sure if he meant that, but I appreciated the sentiment nonetheless.  
When we got home, Brandy was practically buzzing with excitement. Although she’d grown up wealthy, she loved dating someone with such high status, and Trent’s new title only heightened her enthusiasm.  
“Oh my God, babe,” she said, clinging to his arm as they walked through the door. “You’re the youngest partner ever! That’s so sexy.”  
Trent grinned, pulling her close. “You like that, huh?”  
She nodded eagerly, then turned her sharp gaze toward me. “Timmy, I’m wearing the blue dress tonight with the silver heels. Make sure everything’s ready.”  
“Of course, Brandy,” I replied, already heading to her closet.  
The weekend passed in a blur of celebrations. Trent and Brandy partied late into the night while I stayed home, preparing outfits, organizing their belongings, and tidying up after them. By Sunday afternoon, they were lounging in the living room, recovering from their festivities. Brandy was curled up next to Trent on the couch, scrolling through her phone as I brought her a plate of fruit and cheese.  
I set the plate on the coffee table and turned to leave when Trent called out, “Hey, buddy, come here for a sec.”  
I stopped in my tracks, glancing back nervously. “Uh, yeah?”  
Trent sat up a little straighter, his tone casual but firm. “Brandy and I were talking, and we think it might be a good idea for you to take a leave of absence from work.”  
I blinked, sure I’d misheard him. “A… a leave of absence?”  
“Yeah,” he said, leaning back against the couch. “Brandy really likes having you around to help her out with things. And honestly, I’d feel a lot better if you were driving her everywhere instead of her taking Ubers. It’s safer.”  
I stared at him, my stomach twisting with disbelief. He said it so casually, like this was no big deal. As if he could just assign me to his girlfriend like I was some spare resource. My career—my independence—dismissed with a wave of his hand. And for what? So I could become a full-time servant to a girl half my age?  
“But… Trent, this is my career,” I protested weakly. “I can’t just leave. And what about my bills?”  
“Oh, don’t worry about that,” he said, waving a hand dismissively. “I’m making like five times my old salary now. I’ll cover everything. Think about it—no commute, no stress. It’s just six months, and then we’ll see what happens after that.”  
Brandy snuggled closer to him, her voice soft and teasing. “Oh, Timmy, it’ll be so nice to have you around to take care of me.”  
Her words stung. Take care of her? As if that was my purpose now, to cater to her every whim. But the worst part was that I couldn’t argue. Not really. Trent had the power, the money, the status. My protests would mean nothing.  
“I… I don’t know, Trent. I mean, six months is a long time…”  
Trent stood and walked over to me, clapping both hands firmly on my shoulders. His grip was heavy and commanding, and his voice lowered to a tone I hadn’t heard before. “Hey, bud, relax. It’s gonna be fine.” He gave my shoulders a quick squeeze, almost like a father reassuring a child. Then he tilted his head slightly, locking eyes with me. “Now… who’s the boss here, Timmy?”  
The question hung in the air, loaded and unanswerable. My face burned with humiliation. “You… you are,” I mumbled.  
“That’s right,” Trent said with a grin. “And you gotta do what the boss says, right?”  
I nodded, my shoulders slumping as he patted them one last time. “Good man,” he said, walking off to his office.  
I glanced toward Brandy, who was watching the exchange with a faint smirk, her eyes practically gleaming with approval. She loved seeing Trent take charge, loved his confidence and control. It was written all over her expression.  
“Oh, Timmy,” she said, still scrolling through her phone. “Could you be a sweetheart and bring me a glass of water? Thanks.”  
I nodded silently, turning toward the kitchen. My hands trembled as I filled her glass. All I could think was how easily my life had been taken from me. How powerless I’d become.  
Later that night, I lay in my lonely bed in the guest room, staring at the ceiling. The faint hum of the air conditioner filled the space, but it couldn’t drown out the sounds from above. Brandy’s high, breathy moans seeped through the ceiling, her voice full of unrestrained pleasure. Trent’s deeper grunts followed, rhythmic and confident.  
I clenched the sheets in my fists, my face burning. Brandy sounded more aroused than ever, her cries sharper, louder, carrying an almost celebratory edge. I could picture her, glowing with excitement, reveling in Trent’s newfound high status. The youngest partner in the firm. The golden boy. The perfect, powerful couple.  
And then there was me. Lying in a small, nondescript guest room, my belongings shoved into a corner. The bed felt colder than ever, the cheap sheets rough against my skin. This wasn’t even supposed to be my room—it was supposed to be temporary. My condo, my space, had been taken over, piece by piece, until I was reduced to this.  
My career—what little dignity I had left—was slipping through my fingers. Trent had made the decision for me without a second thought, casually brushing aside my protests. And Brandy? She didn’t even bother pretending it was for my benefit. To her, I was just there to serve, to fetch her water, to press her clothes, to make her life easier.  
A full-time servant to a girl half my age.  
The sounds from above grew louder, sharper. Brandy’s cries of ecstasy were almost mocking. I squeezed my eyes shut, wishing I could block it out, but the ache in my chest only grew. It wasn’t just jealousy. It wasn’t just humiliation. It was the crushing weight of knowing that this was my life now.  
I used to have dreams once, didn’t I? A career I was proud of, a condo that felt like mine, even the faint hope that I might meet someone someday. Now, all of that felt like a distant memory, replaced by errands, obedience, and silence.  
As Brandy’s ecstatic cries reached a crescendo, I rolled onto my side, staring blankly at the wall. There was nowhere to go. Nowhere to escape. All I could do was lie there, listening, as my life unraveled one humiliating thread at a time.",1,1735128427.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

I'm looking for appetite control and loosing just a tiny bit of weight and fat, I'm around 21% so pretty healthy range already. 
I'm not new to IF, I used to do 14 hours and up to probably max 17 in the past, but I never went for a whole day yet, and I was very afraid of being super hungry. I've only got back to IF irregularly after I stopped breastfeeding in March and since I started a new work with limitless fruit and nuts and hot chocolate available, my snacking and cravings got a bit out of control and gained around 4kg.

So my boyfriend convinced me to do a full day to see how it goes, and just to experience it. I was at work but managed to stomach coffee without milk and was really busy so it went quite well. I was rarely hungry, there was a bit around 20 hours where I was getting some pangs but solved it witb some tasty chai tee (without milk of course). My MIL invited over to an afternoon rice pudding so I only made it to 23 hours but even when I was sitting at the table waiting for the kids, smelly sweets in front of me, I didn't even crave it. It's wild how this works.

After a week I decided to do a 36 hours and that went very well as well, I was hungry a bit though when I went to bed and maybe because I didn't drink enough, I couldn't sleep so much, I was lying awake for long periods in the night. But I was never craving stuff or crazy hungry, and ever since I had the 23 hours, my appetite went back to normal, I'm not craving sweets and snakcs or grazing throughout the day. I'm really glad I did it, but I'm not sure how frequently I should do these 24 hours fasts, since I don't want to loose muscle, only some fat and weight. I think I would like to continue doing 12-14 hours every day at least. ",2,1735128125.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

I was in love with you & excited to tell everyone that would listen at your 10 week scan when we heard your heart beat. I was 12 weeks and thought we were safe.

This Christmas, I’m carrying you, June. I have been scared to death, but lately I’m not. Not scared of you, but scared to lose you. This morning, I had a  little coffee and sat and felt you move. I wasn’t excited to tell everyone I was pregnant this time. Not because of you, my rainbow girl, but because I’m afraid. And I’m so damn angry at other people. I’ve been over the moon since I found out about you. I remember dancing on the back porch in the early weeks… the crippling fear of every scan. But I’m 26 weeks and I’m starting to feel like I’m going to get to meet you & hold you.

Last Christmas, my Angel baby, I wish I could go back and change it. I wish I could tell you we made it through Christmas and the next 6 months together and I got to meet you. Got to hold you. I wish Christmas wasn’t sad for me when I think of you. I wish you were here with me, your dad, your sister, your grandma and Pop Pop this morning. I wish you were 6 months old in my lap wearing a first Christmas onesie... I’ll miss you forever.

I’m so sad that Zephyr isn’t here & he never will be. I’m so sad that I haven’t only felt pure joy and bliss with you like my first pregnancy because that version of mommy is gone. I’m mostly so thankful at the thought of cuddling you and Livvy Ann together.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Your smile plays a crucial role in how you present yourself to the world. If you have crowns or veneers, you might be wondering about effective teeth whitening options. Unlike natural teeth, crowns and veneers do not respond to whitening treatments in the same way. Here, we will explore strategies to maintain a bright smile with crowns and veneers while keeping them looking their best.

### Understanding Crowns and Veneers

Crowns and veneers are popular choices in cosmetic dentistry to enhance the look of your teeth. Crowns are caps placed over damaged teeth, while veneers are thin shells that cover the front surface of your teeth. Both materials can be made from porcelain, resin, or ceramic. However, since they are not made of natural enamel, traditional whitening methods may not work on them.

### Teeth Whitening for Natural Teeth vs. Crowns and Veneers

When considering teeth whitening, it's essential to know the difference between how natural teeth and dental restorations react:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Natural Teeth:** These can be whitened using various products, including over-the-counter whitening strips, gels, and professional treatments.
- **Crowns and Veneers:** These do not change color with whitening products. They may require alternative methods for maintenance.

### Strategies for Maintaining Whiteness

To keep your crowns and veneers looking bright, follow these strategies:

#### 1. Regular Dental Cleanings

Schedule regular visits to your dentist for cleanings. Professional dental cleanings can remove surface stains that accumulate on your crowns and veneers, helping to maintain their bright appearance. Your dentist can also check for any issues that may affect their look, such as discoloration or wear.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### 2. Good Oral Hygiene Practices

Maintaining an excellent oral hygiene routine helps keep your natural teeth and dental work shining bright:

- Brush your teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.
- Floss daily to remove plaque and food particles from between your teeth.
- Use non-abrasive mouthwash to kill bacteria and freshen your breath.

#### 3. Be Cautious with Staining Foods and Drinks

Some foods and beverages can stain both natural teeth and dental restorations. Limit your consumption of:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Coffee and tea
- Red wine
- Dark berries
- Sauces like soy sauce and tomato sauce

If you choose to indulge in these items, rinse your mouth with water afterward to help wash away any staining agents.

#### 4. Use a Straw

When drinking beverages that can stain, using a straw can help minimize contact with your crowns and veneers. This simple trick can help maintain their pristine appearance.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### 5. Consider Professional Maintenance

If you notice your crowns or veneers starting to lose their luster, consult your dentist. Professional polishing can sometimes restore their shine. In some cases, veneers may need to be replaced if they become too stained or worn out.

### Whitening Toothpaste and Products

If you want to maintain the brightness of your natural teeth without affecting your crowns and veneers, you might want to check out whitening toothpaste. However, look for products that are safe for dental work. Typically, these toothpaste products are designed to remove surface stains without breaking down the material of your veneers or crowns.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Custom Whitening Trays

For those with a mix of natural teeth and restorations, custom whitening trays can be effective. These trays allow you to whiten your natural teeth without affecting your crowns and veneers. Consult your dentist to discuss the best options for your needs.

### Seeking Professional Advice

Consulting your dentist is essential when considering whitening options. They can provide tailored advice based on your specific dental work. Whether it's maintaining your smile or discussing the potential for future whitening, your dentist is your best resource for keeping your teeth, crowns, and veneers looking their best.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
While traditional whitening methods won't work for crowns and veneers, several effective strategies exist to keep your smile bright. Implementing good oral hygiene, controlling dietary choices, and consulting with your dentist will help you achieve a dazzling smile that you'll love to share.

Maintenance Tips for Keeping Your Crowns and Veneers Bright and Radiant
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maintaining the brightness and radiance of your crowns and veneers is essential for a confident smile. Whether you have dental crowns or porcelain veneers, proper care can help them look their best for years to come. Here are some effective tips to keep your smile shining bright.

### Practice Good Oral Hygiene

Good oral hygiene is the foundation of a healthy smile. This includes:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Brushing:** Brush your teeth twice a day using a soft-bristled toothbrush. Make sure to pay attention to the areas around your crowns and veneers.
- **Flossing:** Floss daily to remove plaque and food particles. This is crucial for maintaining the health of your gums and the longevity of your dental restorations.
- **Antimicrobial Mouthwash:** Rinse with an antimicrobial mouthwash to help reduce bacteria that can cause plaque and gum disease.

### Avoid Staining Foods and Beverages

Certain foods and drinks are notorious for causing stains. Consider limiting your intake of the following:

- Coffee and tea
- Red wine
- Colored sodas
- Berry juices and sauces

If you enjoy these items, try to rinse your mouth with water immediately afterward. This can help minimize their staining effects on your crowns and veneers.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Be Mindful of Habits

Your daily habits can greatly influence the appearance of your dental work. Here are some to keep in mind:

- **Avoid Smoking:** Tobacco products can lead to significant discoloration. Quitting smoking will not only help maintain a brighter smile but also improve overall oral health.
- **Limit Sugar Intake:** High-sugar foods can contribute to the growth of bacteria and plaque, which may harm your dental work. Opt for healthier snacks whenever you can.

### Regular Dental Visits

Regular check-ups with your dentist are vital. These visits allow for professional cleanings that can remove any deposits that brushing and flossing might miss. Your dentist can also check for any wear on your crowns and veneers and recommend treatments to keep them looking their best.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Use Recommended Products

When it comes to products designed for maintaining your dental work, only use those recommended by your dentist. Here are some options:

- **Non-Abrasive Toothpaste:** Use a toothpaste formulated for sensitive teeth or enamel-safe that won't scratch the surface of your veneers or crowns.
- **Whitening Products:** If you're considering whitening treatments, consult your dentist first, as some products can be harsh on crowns and veneers.

### Stay Hydrated

Drinking plenty of water is not only beneficial for your overall health, but it also helps wash away food particles and bacteria in your mouth. Staying hydrated supports the production of saliva, an essential component in preserving the brightness of your smile.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Consider Home Care Kits

Discuss with your dentist about home care kits specifically designed for braces, crowns, and veneers. These can include:

- Specialized cleaning tools to maintain areas around dental work
- Whitening gels that are safe for use on crowns and veneers

Using these products as part of your daily routine can further enhance the longevity and brightness of your smile.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Maintain a Balanced Diet

A balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals can help keep your teeth healthy. Foods high in calcium, like dairy products, and those with Vitamin D support stronger teeth and gums. Crunchy fruits and vegetables can aid in naturally cleaning your teeth as you chew.

### Know When to Seek Help

If you notice any discoloration, wear, or damage to your crowns and veneers, do not hesitate to reach out to your dentist. Early intervention can often rectify problems before they worsen, saving you time and money in the long run.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
By following these maintenance tips, you can ensure that your crowns and veneers remain as radiant as the day they were placed. Keeping up with your oral hygiene and lifestyle choices truly makes a significant difference in maintaining the beauty of your smile!

### Conclusion

Achieving a bright and radiant smile when you have crowns and veneers can be a unique challenge, but with the right strategies and maintenance tips, you can keep your dental enhancements looking their best. Effective teeth whitening methods specifically designed for crowns and veneers include professional whitening treatments and over-the-counter products that are safe for dental work. However, always consult your dentist before trying any new whitening procedure to ensure compatibility with your existing dental work.

Maintaining the brightness of your crowns and veneers goes beyond initial whitening treatments. Regular oral hygiene practices—like brushing with non-abrasive toothpaste, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash—play a vital role in preventing discoloration. It's also wise to limit the intake of stain-causing foods and drinks. Additionally, routine dental check-ups will help you identify any issues early and keep your dental work in prime condition.

It is possible to chat few hours before the date but this feature is mostly meant to communicate of any delays etc.

So I had matched with someone and the date was planned. I live in a smaller village so I needed to travel 1h to the capital city for the date. Once I arrived to the cafe my date sent me message he was running late 30min due a mix-up.

The cafe was pretty quiet and I ordered coffee and sat down to wait. During this time I ended up chatting with the bartender who was working alone that afternoon. We were hitting off really well. At some point he started serve another customer and I picked up my book. Every now and then I glanced at him and always caught him smiling to me, I smiled back.

I really wanted to give a chance to my date so I waited him and when almost an hour had passed and I was just about to go he finally arrived.

I was slightly irritated but I tried not to let it affect me. I was also disappointed that my date didn’t look exactly like in his pictures.

We had ok time but I felt he made awkward jokes about my hobbies that made me feel uncomftorable. I decided to end the date after 45min and told him I wanted to go home.

When he used a toilet I picked a pen and a piece of paper of my journal and wrote down my number. I paid my drink and handed the paper to the bartender thanking for him the nice talk we had before. He thanked me and said ”see you again”

Outside of the cafe I told the date I don’t see us going for more dates and wished him well. He replied by asking if I would wanna kiss him. I turned around and walked away extremely irritated.

I told this story to my friend later on and she said I was an a-hole for giving the number to the bartender at a date and I should have just come back for it later. I felt like I would not travel 1h just to come give my number. So yeah, AITAH?",4,1735127434.0,AITAH,10,0.83,False

Merry Christmas, dear friends and family!

The most wonderful of nights!!! Cardi is still sleeping. I’m sipping coffee in the breakfast room here. 

Incredible good news yesterday from the police! (I found the associated news stories about the gang arrests ([here](https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/us-news/feds-raid-migrant-tren-de-aragua-gang-house-in-nyc-after-tracking-gps-ankle-monitor-to-hideout/) and [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/americas/guatemala-raid-ultra-orthodox-jewish-sect.html?smid=nytcore-android-share)). When we arrived at the hotel yesterday we called the Mandel family but police had already notified them.

Pillow talk: the base where I will do BCT is in a state that permits marriage of 16-year-olds (with parental consent). Both of our families want to come for my graduation, of course, but my family will have to work through documentation issues and weigh risks. We decided it would still be best to marry right after graduation (although there’s a mandatory 72-hour delay) since I have no idea yet where I will complete advanced training and it could be in a state with 18+ marriage laws. So this window is best even if my family can’t come.

Military or civil? When will Cardi move with me? Diploma or GED? Final steps to documentation? So much more still to discuss and decide.

From the hotel, Dr. Mandel is picking us up at 10am and then dental examinations, thank you, Dr. Mandel! Next: Hanukkah and the “*latkes*” I’ve heard so much about.

Oops. Text message: “Pvt. Yao, report to duty!” Gotta run! I'm sure she just wants to do Gongyo!

I've always been prone to depression since I am neurodivergent but I swear since I started HRT, I became way more prone to be bothered by the tiniest things and overthink them to all hell, like, really silly shit makes me linger and fall into depression for hours, there's also many intrusive thoughts and emotions that are hard to deal with. In general day to day, my mind is constantly overthinking, falling into constant emotional slumps again and again and the only thing that alleviates it is something like drinking coffee but it's not perfect and it doesn't work all the time. There were times I wondered if it was all caused by HRT, few days ago I finally decided to test it by lowering my dose in half to 6.25. It seems I was proven right, my depression, intrusive emotions and overthinking were exacerbated by HRT, because in just one day my mind felt lighter, the incessant sadness and depression and overthinking were like 90% less and I felt like I can just live life fine but here comes the caveat that made me make this post. 
Not long after on day 2, I started to feel the good old male inability to cry again, like there was this emotional wall again, and also the weirdest thing is that I started to feel like a guy again, like I can't describe it properly but my mind started feeling like pre-HRT me, I just started to feel masculine again, dysphoria increased, and I just didn't feel like the girl I've been for the past year. So I immediately went back on the higher dose and everything went back to how it's been for the past year but I am back with dealing with the depression and overthinking, and I am sick of those, so I don't know what to do?

I’ve tried the original Hacivat, and this comes surprisingly close. I purchased it two months ago, and while the performance doesn’t match the original, it’s good enough. It lasts around 5 hours on skin with medium projection. The opening is a burst of freshly cut pineapple and lemon, and the drydown leans sweet and oakmossy.

**Albait Aldimashqi Layton**

I haven’t tried the original Layton, but this one is very spicy with hints of lavender (or something similar). In the drydown, it turns sweet and vanillic. The performance is extremely good —lasting at least 10 hours on skin with beastly projection.

**Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa**

The name says it all so I don't think I need to elaborate much. This is a sweet, boozy fragrance with a subtle coffee note that appears sporadically but never dominates. The performance and projection are unmatched—lasting 2–3 days on clothes.

**Zimaya Sharaf Blend**

This is spicier, less sweet, and more boozy compared to Khamrah Qahwa. I get about 6 hours on skin, but I’ve just recently added it to my collection. I expect it to perform better as it matures. It smells higher quality than Khamrah Qahwa.

**Al Rehab Choco Musk**

This reminds me of Complan Powder, but I absolutely love it. My 2023 batch seems different from the general consensus, but it’s incredible. I sense a blend of vanilla, milk chocolate, and maybe even whipped cream. For the price, it smells shockingly high quality. It lasts about 7 hours with great projection.

**Al Rehab French Coffee**

My 2024 batch probably needs more time to mature. Right now, it smells like artificial stale coffee (keep in mind, I’m a coffee snob) with a touch of vanilla. It lasts 5–6 hours on skin. I mostly layer it with Choco Musk to add sophistication, but I rarely wear it on its own.

**Armaf Club de Nuit Urban Man Elixir**

When I first got it, it smelled like Sauvage EDT with an Aventus-like drydown. After months of maturation, it opens with a mix of Sauvage EDT and the burnt sugar sweetness of BR540. This is the best performer in my rotation, and I use it daily for college.

**Liquid Brun**

This one is a gourmand vanilla bomb but starts off very harsh. It's drydown kinda reminds me of Honor and Glory by Lattafa.It lasts about 6 hours on skin. Despite all the hype, it didn’t quite blow me away. ",9,1735127016.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,8,1.0,False

We are located right next to a large plant for a major corporation, and I work for one of the Big Three hotel chains. Most of our business comes from contractors who work at that plant. There aren’t a lot of buildings around our hotel other than another hotel and large fabrication plants. Occasionally, we have some homeless people wander in, but it’s extremely rare—never more than once every few months, if not longer. We also don’t get many check-ins because our hotel is on the smaller side, so we often have a lot of downtime.

The other night, we had a man walk in and set something on the table next to the sliding doors. This table holds some promotional credit card information and dog treats. I work at the bar, and there’s a TV with a large case around it as well as a fireplace that blocks my view of one of the front desks—the desk that is primarily used.

This man stood there for a second, then walked past the TV into my view. He noticed me and walked toward the bar. He was wearing a nice windbreaker, had well-groomed facial hair, and showed no signs of being homeless. He asked, “Can I bother you for a cup of coffee?” Assuming he was a guest staying at the hotel, I pointed toward our coffee station and told him he could help himself.

He then said, “Great, I brought my own cups to use.” At this point, I realized he wasn’t actually a hotel guest. The man walked over to the aforementioned table, grabbed his cups, and went to the coffee station. I thought about the situation and figured I couldn’t just tell him no after already telling him yes. If he was really just down on his luck, a cup of coffee or two wouldn’t hurt us or him. He capped his cups and said something along the lines of, “Usually, I can get a cup of ramen for $2 at the hotel next door, but only sometimes, depending on whether the girl or the guy is working. The girl always screams at me to get out, but the guy is cool about it and lets me buy the ramen. Can you do something like that?” I looked him in the eye and said, “Sorry, it’s a bit pricier here than that.”

He thanked me and started walking outside. I went to the back office to talk to the front desk agent, explained what happened, and mentioned how it was suspicious but didn’t require action. I thought that was the end of it.

He then walked back in an hour later and approached the desk. My coworker went to help him. I didn’t hear their full conversation, but from what I gathered and her explanation afterward, he had asked her if there was something wrong with the blankets in the dumpster and whether he could take them. At this point, we had two problems: we were dealing with a homeless person loitering on the property, and he was going through our trash, which posed a liability risk for the hotel. She notified our manager for follow-up the next day and tried to keep an eye out.

The next day, I was again talking with the front desk associate in the back office when we saw the same man on camera walking in. This time, instead of stopping at the desk, he walked straight to the bar and sat down. I walked over, greeted him, and acknowledged him. He mentioned how it was rainy and cold and that he had ridden his bike here from the library about a mile down the street. Then he asked if he could get another coffee from the station. I told him, “Unfortunately, that coffee is only for hotel guests.” He mumbled something under his breath—I could barely understand him but caught phrases like, “Are you for real?” and “I can’t?” I told him I was sorry, but he had to leave. He walked out, and that was the last I saw of him.

I informed my coworker at the desk that if he returned, we’d probably have to call the police and have him trespassed. It sucks that he was down on his luck, and I wish I could have helped him more. However, if someone comes in more than once—especially asking for hotel property—it becomes an issue we can’t ignore. Hopefully, he understands and doesn’t come back. Otherwise, things might get worse for him.",4,1735126739.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,0,1.0,False

This guy in line started talking to me. He seemed friendly, I thought, “Fine, it’s a public place, I’ll be polite.” We talked about coffee, the weather, and random stuff.

Then he asked for my number. I didn’t want to make things awkward, so I gave it, thinking, ""What’s the worst that could happen?"" Well, turns out, a lot.

The messages started almost immediately. At first, it was casual stuff like, ""Hey, nice meeting you."" But then it became, ""Why aren’t you replying?"" and “I saw your Insta—cute pics.” It got weird, fast.

I stopped replying, hoping he’d take the hint, but nope. He started messaging on WhatsApp, Instagram, and even tried Snapchat. I had to block him everywhere, and honestly, it ruined my mood.

Balewadi High Street is great, but I wish people would get that no reply means “I’m not interested.” Ladies, has something like this ever happened to you? Or do I just attract the wrong kind of energy?

I rarely feel like staying longer in a place, but Banaras was different. By the time my trip ended, I was wishing I’d miss my train so I could spend a few more days just wandering around and soaking in the vibes.  

For all four days, I mostly walked everywhere, exploring the narrow lanes near the ghats. It was such a beautiful experience—those small streets have a charm that’s hard to put into words. 

And oh, the food! Banaras is a dream for foodies like me. Here’s everything I tried:  
Deena Chaatand,Kashi Chaat,were as amazing as everyone says.
Laxmi Chai and Pehalwan Lassi were good but not great.
Shree Ji's Malaiyo was a sweet treat I couldn’t get enough of.And not only of shreeji but malaiyo tastes good from all the shops and vendors.

Ram Bhandar was good but honestly felt a bit overhyped as per my taste.
Neelu Kachori and Gauri Shankar’s kachori  were hidden gems—completely underrated and absolutely delicious.  
I also had BHU VT’s cold coffee and samosa chaat, and both hit the spot perfectly.  
Also a tiny shop near the ghats in the evening that served the crispiest vadas with a spicy coconut chutney—pure heaven.
On the ghats, I tried lemon tea, chai, and idli-vada from local vendors. Oh, and I treated myself to an apple pie with ice cream at Pizzeria, which is overrated for sure.

I did shared boat rides during both sunrise and sunset (₹100 per ride), and I can’t even describe how beautiful it was. Seeing the ghats during sunrise and then glowing softly at sunset was something else entirely.  

Mornings were my favorite part of the trip. I’d walk along the ghats alone, sit quietly for a while, and just take in the calm. Those peaceful moments by the river felt so special.  

Of course, I visited the temples too—Kashi Vishwanath (should go early morning for less crowd), Kaal Bhairav, Sankat Mochan, and BHU VT. Each one had a unique vibe, and they added so much depth to my trip.  

Since I was traveling solo, I stayed at Gypsy Diaries Hostel. It was affordable and perfect for someone like me who wanted to explore without spending a lot.  

This trip was everything I could’ve hoped for and more. Banaras is one of those places that leaves a mark on your soul. I already can’t wait to go back, and this time, I’ll make sure to stay longer.",7,1735126629.0,SoloTravel_India,0,1.0,False

I am in so much pain right now. It's only been a week but as I process there were so many things I felt in the relationship but I ignored. I will add the list below. 

My biggest fear is him finding someone else he would change all of these things for. What I want to know is, are these qualities that he will always possess? Or is it likely due to our relationship.   


* Never wanted sex
* He only wanted to peck me on the lips
* Never publicly affectionate
* Would walk away from me without saying where he was going and always left an awkward atmosphere in his parents house
* Never gave me reassurance, making me so anxious
* Said I wanted too many cuddles
* Never gave compliments back like I gave to him
* Picked on things, e.g. said all my clothes were the same
* I started feeling like I had to always be done up around him
* Made paying awkward
* Made me pay for things exactly 50/50, which was fine but the way he delivered it always felt like he didn’t want to spend on me
* Complained about how much things cost all the time
* Never wanted to go for walks
* Never wanted to go for a coffee
* Didn’t enjoy our holidays. TOLD ME some of our holidays he didn’t fully love, ‘they were ok’
* Said yes to going on a US trip with a friend despite me asking him to go for a full year
* Made lack of travelling about his health when he just didn’t want to go
* He was spoilt, he’d receive money on holiday and never spend it
* He hated coming to weddings with me, but not ones he went to alone
* I felt anxious to introduce him to friends 
* He was actually rude when he wanted to be
* He took his low moods out on me
* He never wanted to hear about my past and shamed me for talking about it
* He’d often call me out when I was wrong in front of people
* When someone mentioned a proposal/marriage he would joke his way out of it
* Didn’t text me or call me often, said he would never be a texter
* He was in hospital 3 times while we were together. I barely received any thanks
* When he came out of hospital, he went straight back to his parents
* He had a weird obsession with running back to his family
* He idolised his older brother (who was actually a mess)
* He idolised his parents relationship, but never ours, even though it seems miserable and boring
* He would always talk about the next best thing
* I would cough in my sleep and he would complain I was keeping him awake
* He is the favourite in his family, but it actually just fed his ego
* He would spend an unhealthy amount of time on his phone
* Never wanted to or would loosely commit to future plans
* Was never obsessed or made me feel desired, except from the start
* I went to therapy and he not once asked how it was going 
* He found my emotions uncomfortable
* He never wanted to have deep conversations
* His rich family background/trust fund meant he always had a way out
* He never prioritised me, we always did what he wanted to do
* Said he was never excited for anything

- Government insiders like former Senate Intelligence Committee member Kirk McConnell take NHI seriously and talk about it openly (well, after a DOPSR review anyway).
- Miracles can and do happen, and when I stop worrying about the future and take every day as it comes life becomes much easier. 
- The US government turns into a Three Stooges act if anything unexpected happens. 
- Being nice to people when they’re being mean to you disarms them. 
- It can be *really hard* to be nice to some people (I’ve still got work to do). 
- A lot of people don’t spend enough time just looking up at the night sky. 
- Anomalous experiences can be associated with measurable bursts of gamma radiation. 
- “I’m a Reddit mod of a subreddit for people who think they’ve been abducted by aliens” is not as good of a pickup line as you’d think.  
- Non-verbal people with autism may legitimately be psychic wizards, and that the people who are the most spiritually advanced may not be the ones you expect. 
- Spending time doing nothing leaves space for something to happen. 
- The thing Skinwalker Ranch fans want more than anything else in the entire world is for Brandon Fugal to blow up the mesa.

He said he can shade match to my existing teeth but told me i need to be comfortable with the color that i have rn. 

My teeth aren’t yellow so tbh im happy with the color but im worried that 10 years down the line  i won’t be happy with the color and would want them whitened? Should i go for teeth bleaching, is it hard to keep them white? i drink a lot of tea/coffee so im worried they won’t stay white and the veneers will stand out after a couple of years.

Remember, you’re not alone. Whether you’ve chosen this life or it’s chosen you, your story is valid. Things can change, even when it feels impossible. Keep pushing, keep dreaming, and hold onto the belief that brighter days are ahead.

Merry Christmas from one car dweller to another. May this season bring you unexpected kindness and the courage to keep moving forward.

I’ve recently bought a Delonghi EC230 machine, and I’m having trouble pouring coffee the way I’d like. Whenever I pour a shot, it comes out very watery, like an americano, when I’d like an espresso with crema. I used to work as a barista, and I’ve read the beginners guide here just in case but I can’t work out what’s gone wrong.

I’ve filled the tank, used a pretty fine grind, and filled the portafilter about 2/3 of the way. Is it a case of not letting the machine heat up long enough? Or is it still an issue with the ground coffee itself? 

Any advice or input would be much appreciated. Thanks!

1hlyule,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1hlyule/nothing_but_sourness/,Nothing but sourness,"Hello everyone,

I have bought a Robot, but after a few attempts I am frustrated. I only get acidic espresso. I have a K-Ultra hand grinder. I started grinding in the lower range so the robot could only extract over 70 seconds (grindsetting = 0.2.7). Even that attempt was sour, then I went coarser to get the 25 seconds or so without preinfusion (grindsetting = 0.3.0). I use 18g of coffee. So far every result is completely acidic. I know it's probably hard to distinguish bitter from sour. But I could taste some bitterness when I brewed for 70 seconds, so I think I can tell the difference. 

In other words, I have a coffee that can be extracted at around 25 seconds and 6 bar. I leave the pre-infusion for about 5 seconds as soon as the coffee appears at the bottom. Then I go quickly (not fast) to the 6 bar until I get to 36g-40g output.

I have already read a lot about the robot and also watched videos. It's always said that the Robot can't produce any bad espresso at all. In my case, I can't even begin to make an enjoyable espresso.

Finally, I tried to preheat everything, but there is an opinion that this is not necessary with the robot. I have tested different variants. Basket + filter, only filter and only basket. I also tried draining the water and filling it up. This was also a variant to preheat. The result is complete sourness. 

In my opinion, the puck looks good at the end. So I would rule out channeling. When I preinfuse at 1-2 bar, I can see that the coffee is evenly distributed underneath.

I compress the coffee in the basket with about 800g.

The coffee itself is from a local roaster. I honestly can't tell whether it's light or medium. But as I understand it, both should be possible with the Robot.

I honestly don't know what else I could test, except darker beans. I prefer medium beans, which should also be possible. Do you have any ideas?",2,1735124883.0,CafelatRobot,19,0.75,False

We’ve all been there. You’re chatting with someone, and suddenly, a whiff of something less-than-pleasant wafts your way. It's an awkward situation, and you might even wonder if *you're* the source of the odor. If you suffer from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), you might also be wondering if your digestive woes are contributing to the problem. So, does IBS cause bad breath? Let's dive deep into this sometimes-sensitive topic and clear the air, so to speak.

Does IBS Cause Bad Breath? Exploring the Connection
---------------------------------------------------

The relationship between gut health and breath freshness isn't always straightforward. Think of your digestive system as a complex ecosystem. When things are in balance, everything runs smoothly. But when this balance is disrupted, as is often the case with IBS, it can trigger a cascade of effects, some of which might manifest as bad breath. So, while IBS doesn't *directly* cause bad breath, it can certainly contribute to it indirectly through a number of pathways.

### How IBS Can Indirectly Influence Breath Freshness

IBS primarily affects the large intestine, and its symptoms – bloating, gas, constipation, or diarrhea – stem from disruptions in gut motility and the gut microbiome. These disruptions can lead to:

1. **Altered Gut Microbiome:** IBS can shift the balance of bacteria in your gut. An overgrowth of certain bacteria can produce sulfurous compounds, the same culprits responsible for that rotten egg smell. These compounds can be absorbed into the bloodstream and released through the lungs, contributing to bad breath.
2. **Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO):** While not directly caused by IBS, SIBO is more common in people with IBS. SIBO occurs when bacteria from the large intestine migrate into the small intestine, where they feast on undigested food, producing hydrogen sulfide and methane gas, both notorious for their unpleasant odor.
3. **Food Malabsorption:** IBS can interfere with nutrient absorption. This can lead to undigested food lingering in the gut, providing fuel for odor-producing bacteria.
4. **Changes in Dietary Habits:** People with IBS often modify their diets to manage their symptoms. Restricting certain foods or increasing the intake of others might inadvertently influence breath freshness. For example, low-FODMAP diets, while helpful for IBS management, can sometimes lead to increased sulfur production in the gut.
5. **Stress and Anxiety:** IBS and stress often go hand in hand. Stress can dry out your mouth, reducing saliva production, which plays a crucial role in washing away odor-causing bacteria. This can worsen existing bad breath, regardless of its underlying cause.

Does IBS Cause Bad Breath? Addressing Common Misconceptions
-----------------------------------------------------------

Often, the connection between IBS and bad breath is exaggerated or misinterpreted. While we've discussed how IBS can *indirectly* contribute to bad breath, it's important to dispel some common myths:

- **Myth 1: All IBS sufferers have bad breath.** This is absolutely false. While some individuals with IBS might experience bad breath, it's not a universal symptom.
- **Myth 2: Bad breath is a *direct* result of IBS.** Nope. As we’ve established, the connection is more nuanced and stems from the secondary effects of IBS on digestion and the gut environment.
- **Myth 3: Treating IBS will automatically eliminate bad breath.** While managing IBS can certainly help improve overall gut health, and potentially reduce bad breath associated with gut imbalances, it's not a guaranteed fix. Other factors, such as poor oral hygiene or underlying medical conditions, can also contribute to bad breath.

Does IBS Cause Bad Breath? Practical Tips for Fresher Breath
------------------------------------------------------------

So, what can you do if you suspect your IBS is playing a role in your breath freshness? Here are some practical strategies:

- **Prioritize Gut Health:** A healthy gut is key to overall well-being, including fresh breath. This means focusing on a balanced diet, managing stress, and potentially incorporating probiotics or prebiotics to support a healthy gut microbiome.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water helps flush out the digestive system and keeps your mouth moist, minimizing odor-causing bacteria. Think of it as giving your internal plumbing a good rinse.
- **Practice Excellent Oral Hygiene:** This seems obvious, but it’s crucial! Brush and floss twice daily, scrape your tongue (yes, your tongue harbors bacteria!), and use mouthwash to maintain oral freshness.
- **Address SIBO:** If you suspect SIBO, consult with your doctor. Treatment typically involves antibiotics or herbal remedies to rebalance the gut microbiome.
- **Manage Stress:** Stress can exacerbate IBS symptoms and contribute to dry mouth, worsening bad breath. Explore stress-reducing techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises. Isn't it crazy how interconnected our bodies are?
- **Consider a Low-Sulfur Diet:** If you notice a sulfurous odor to your breath, try temporarily limiting high-sulfur foods like garlic, onions, and cruciferous vegetables.
- **Don't Neglect Regular Checkups:** Regular visits to your dentist and doctor can help identify and address any underlying issues contributing to bad breath, beyond IBS.

Beyond IBS: Other Potential Causes of Bad Breath
------------------------------------------------

It's vital to remember that bad breath isn't always related to IBS. Plenty of other factors can be at play, such as:

- **Poor oral hygiene:** The most common culprit! Food particles trapped between teeth and on the tongue become a feast for bacteria, leading to unpleasant odors.
- **Dry mouth:** Saliva acts as a natural cleanser, washing away bacteria and food debris. Conditions like Sjögren's syndrome or certain medications can cause dry mouth,contributing to bad breath.
- **Infections:** Respiratory infections, sinus infections, and even tonsillitis can produce bad breath.
- **Certain medical conditions:** Diabetes, liver disease, and kidney disease can also cause distinct breath odors.
- **Smoking and tobacco use:** Need we say more? Tobacco wreaks havoc on oral health and contributes to chronic bad breath.
- **Certain foods and drinks:** Garlic, onions, coffee, and alcohol are notorious for lingering on your breath.

When to Seek Professional Help for Bad Breath
---------------------------------------------

While most cases of bad breath can be managed with lifestyle changes and improved oral hygiene, it's important to seek professional advice if:

- Your bad breath is persistent and doesn't improve despite your best efforts.
- You experience other symptoms like dry mouth, pain, or changes in taste.
- You're concerned about an underlying medical condition.

Conclusion
----------

So, back to our initial question: does IBS cause bad breath? The answer, in a nutshell, is not directly. However, the physiological changes associated with IBS *can* indirectly contribute to bad breath. By understanding this connection and implementing the strategies outlined above – from prioritizing gut health and managing stress to maintaining excellent oral hygiene – you can take proactive steps towards fresher breath and greater confidence. Remember, addressing bad breath often involves a holistic approach that considers both oral and digestive health.

I’ve experimented with intermittent fasting here and there earlier in the year but I dropped it as work load increased. Then as the colder months came up I started eating a lot of high protein and fibrous foods but would slip up and eat junk to satiate my appetite, especially from the vending at work. 

Throughout the year I’ve been lifting weights and people have noticed that I’ve slimmed down SOME and my muscles are definitely popping. So much to the point that I feel focusing on losing this flab around my stomach and thighs will begin to show off my gains.

I’ve been contemplating a schedule that would work best for me and it goes something like this. (I definitely am able to long fast btw it’s just the pressure from having a Latin family focused on eating throughout the day):

Sunday: 1-2 hours of lifting at the gym. Light cardio. 2 hard boiled eggs, grapefruit, Greek yogurt. Black coffee. Multivitamin and fish oil. Begin fast. 

Monday: fasting. 1-2 hrs of cardio. 

Tuesday: fasting. Repeat. 

Wednesday. Beef and eggs. Greek yogurt. Whole milk + protein mix. 1-2 hrs of lifting. Light cardio. Multivitamin and fish oil. Begin fast. 

Thursday: Fasting. 1-2 hrs of cardio. 

Friday: fasting. Repeat.

Saturday: chicken and  broccoli, Greek yogurt. Whole milk + protein mix. 2-3 hour of lifting. Multivitamin and fish oil.

The two pushed the cart away and I headed up to the production floor. Then we got busy, really slammed call after call. Then it hit me, the wafting smell of dozens of hot crispy chicken Fingers, hot fries filled the air. I got hungry. The cart had been brought up somewhere and was making the environment smell delicious. The calls kept coming and lunch was running late. The hungrier I got the stronger the smell got. Finally I get up to refill water and I see it there with at least 25 boxes of chic fil a just sitting on a push cart next to an empty managers desk beneath an AC duct. What's worse? Some of my colleagues, non managers started appearing with boxes of food. When I approached someone I was met with the same response, ""its for management, their meeting is taking long that's all."" So I went downstairs to the Cafe, closed early due to managers meeting. So now my plan of eating something hot to satisfy my need for fried chicken was shut down. I ate some hard boiled eggs and coffee for lunch out the cafe cooler. Paid my 6.25 and sat down to scroll and ease my aching stomach. Then I saw one, the. Two then six, boxes of chic fil a! Was I the only asshole in the entire cafeteria who paid for his cold wet egg lunch? Maybe they were handing them out upstairs now? A couple co workers walk by, ""hey how did you get a box?"" ""Oh, this? My boss gave it to me, shh im not supposed to say."" Then another, then another! I went back upstairs, almost jogging, thinking i could still get a box. Met with same gate keeping answers. It's time to clock in as I sit down I see the cart, still piled HIGH with food, sitting there. Hours went by and the cart sat there, the smell fumigation my senses and making the already shitty job unbearable. Cue another co worker set interacting the same way, same cadence even. Ten minutes before my shift I get up to use bathroom and see the cart has been ransacked. Not as many boxes now, a few open ones with only fries, then I see it. Maybe six boxes of chic fil a stuffed into a trash can, their now cold and soggy contents spilled out. Literally almost 11 fingers just in sight. I almost ate some. It was after smelling one of my favorite foods in excess for hours on end and then having to see it in the trash makes a man lose it. I haven't eaten chic fil a since.

1hly9hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1hly9hf/last_night_i_binged_after_recovering_from/,"Last night, I binged after recovering from BED—Here's how I'm moving forward:","**I’m recovered from Binge Eating Disorder, but yesterday I binged. Here’s how I’m coping.** I sat down to journal this morning and thought I'd share everything I wrote here as well. I'm not going to explain HOW I've healed, this is purely to share my self-reflection from a healed mind. Hope it helps all of you.

I went through recovery for Binge Eating Disorder a few years ago and have been in a good place (most of the time) ever since. But last night, I still had a binge.

Last night, we had a Christmas dinner at my grandmother’s house. I ended up binging to the point where it hurt to breathe. If my family hadn’t been around, I probably would’ve purged in the bathroom—not just to get rid of calories (I’m not going to lie about that part), but mainly to ease the physical discomfort. But I didn’t do it. This morning, I woke up with a swollen face and a terrible headache.

Even though I’ve been “recovered” for a while now, I still have moments like this. The difference is, I’ve learned better coping mechanisms, and these episodes don’t spiral into a month-long cycle anymore like they used to. Here’s how I’m approaching it:

1. **Regret and compassion:** I woke up feeling a lot of regret, but also compassion. I reminded myself: it’s okay—I’m human, and this happens sometimes. I’m not perfect, but I’m doing so much better than I was a few years ago. I’m not punishing myself. Instead, I sat on the floor, touched my body, and apologized for giving it so much sugar. I thanked my body for processing everything.
2. **Fasting until I'm actually hungry again:** Since I had a big binge last night, I’m not hungry right now. I also had a massive headache, so I’ve been drinking tea and coffee (without anything added) to stay in a “fasting state” a bit longer and let my body process and digest. When I feel hungry, I’ll have a healthy breakfast with lots of protein, healthy fats, and fiber.
3. **Kindness over punishment:** Today is all about kindness. Binging is just as hard on the mind (with self-hate and self-disgust) as it is on the body. So, I’m being EXTRA kind to myself today. I’ll nourish my body, take a calm walk etc. Whatever we give a lot of attention to expands, and I don’t want to teach my brain to dwell in negativity. I reflected on what happened, and now I’m letting it go—with kindness.
4. **Journaling and reflection:**
   * **Why did I binge?**
      * I realized that the dinner was at my grandmother’s house—a place where I’ve binged countless times in the past, especially in my 20s. It’s always been a triggering environment for me because of our family’s unstable and difficult dynamics. It’s also become a habit for me and my sister to overeat during Christmas. That’s it—it’s a combination of triggers and learned behavior.
   * **How to do better next time:**
      * Plan ahead, especially if we’re celebrating at my grandmother’s house (a major trigger for me).
      * Come with awareness, eat enough proper food beforehand, and eat mindfully during the meal.
      * Start with healthy fiber to help stabilize blood sugar before eating sweets.
      * Write myself reminders about how proud I’ll feel if I eat without binging.
      * Before dessert, take a moment to hide in the bathroom, breathe for 2 minutes, and center myself.
      * Allow myself one piece of everything on the table but commit to not taking seconds.
      * After eating, step away from the kitchen and distract myself with something else. If I feel urges to continue eating, then I just practise self-discipline and won't do it. Hide in the bathroom and focus on my breath again if needed. :D

It happened, and it’s okay. I’ll continue eating healthy and mindfully for the rest of the day. I might even allow myself one more piece of cake later, but only if it feels right. For now, I’ll nourish my body with kindness—through movement (a calm walk in nature), healthy food (like salads and salmon), and by letting go of yesterday. That's it.",6,1735122086.0,BingeEatingDisorder,0,1.0,False
1hly8ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hly8ic/watchers_part_1_of_2/,Watchers (Part 1 of 2),"""Here we are – Dunn’s Creek!"" Steve shouted as he, Dave, Tommy, and Lara stretched as they climbed out of the car and trudged along the deserted main street. ""The fog is a bit weird, though, especially in the middle of August. But I guess it adds to the vibe."" The houses lining the street to the left and right still appeared as if they hadn’t been abandoned for too long—maybe a few years. One could still sense how beautiful this place must have been once. The red sandstone buildings and the small log cabins with their protruding facades still had a touch of elegance and Western American romance, which in many modern cities had long become a relic of past days or mediocre Western movies. Overall, the town was in a remarkably well-preserved condition; only some boarded-up windows, rusted cars on the streets, and thorny vines and hedges that had crept over the sidewalks into the houses signaled that it had been quite some time since Dunn’s Creek was filled with life.

""Yeah, sure. Really picturesque here,"" Lara rolled her eyes. She had imagined something else for a relaxing weekend getaway. But Steve loved exploring lost places, just like his two friends Dave and Tommy, so it wasn’t a big surprise that they had taken a two-hour detour to search this admittedly rather interesting place, instead of heading straight to the lake. Lara, however, felt anything but comfortable in this ghost town. In the last two years, she had often accompanied her boyfriend to such places—abandoned towns and houses, deserted factories, empty hotels, dilapidated ruins, and crumbling mines. She often felt as though she shouldn’t be there, as if it were forbidden to visit these old places, or as if something was lurking, watching them the entire time. But perhaps it was exactly that which intrigued her boyfriend about exploring these places. ""Come on,"" Tommy said, ""this place is really cool. Just look at all these buildings. It’s like there was a thriving little town here just a few months ago.""

The group continued walking along the main street. ""Yeah,"" Lara replied, ""but I still find it creepy. We don’t even know why the town was abandoned. What if dangerous gases are seeping up from the ground or something? Maybe this isn’t fog after all."" The fog, the winding alleys, the forest, and the hills surrounding the town, not to mention the completely deserted streets, made Dunn’s Creek a creepy place, giving Lara a sense of unreality. She wrapped her arms around herself and followed the rest of the group.

""Look at that! Have you ever seen something like this?"" Steve suddenly called out, pointing at the church tower about 50 meters ahead of them. Lara squinted her eyes to see what he meant through the light fog swirling around the tower. ""The bell..."" Steve added. Now Lara saw it too. ""Strange..."" she replied. ""Maybe it’s broken?"" The bell was moving inside the tower, as though it was ringing, yet there was no sound. ""Oh no, how creepy, something’s broken in a ghost town!"" Tommy’s voice was dripping with sarcasm. ""Oh, shut up, you idiot,"" Steve retorted. Dave chuckled.

After a few more minutes of walking along the main street, they rounded a corner and came upon a beautiful two-story sandstone building, with a double-winged entrance leading up to it by a stone staircase. In front of the building was a small park with a once-lovely garden, now certainly overgrown, surrounded by a low, Gothic-style black iron fence. ""The library,"" Lara said, nodding towards the sign in front of the building explaining its function. ""It’s beautiful!"" She took a few steps backward to get a better look at the building. ""Shit!"" she suddenly screamed, her heart skipping a beat. The others burst into laughter. She had walked backward into a small garden wall she hadn’t noticed, fallen onto it, and ended up sitting down. To avoid falling backward off the wall, she instinctively stretched her arms out to find something to hold onto. But there was already someone sitting on the wall. At least, that’s what she thought at first, as her hand landed on the shoulder of a statue someone had placed there.

""Fuck!"" she shouted. ""I almost had a heart attack! Who would put a damn statue on a garden wall?"" As the others laughed, Lara looked more closely at the statue. Had she not been so startled, she might have been impressed by the level of detail. Whoever had crafted the lifelike bust was a master of their craft. The folds in the fabric, the individual hairs, the look of the man as he nervously glanced over his shoulder. The artist had painted the statue, and the paint still looked fresh, as though it had just dried, despite all the time it had been exposed to the elements. In another context, Lara, an art enthusiast and amateur painter, might have appreciated the statue, but here in Dunn’s Creek, it seemed creepy. ""Can we please just go? I hate this place!"" she asked, clearly annoyed. ""Are you crazy?"" Steve replied. ""I was just about to suggest we check if the library’s locked. I wonder if there’s anything interesting inside."" ""You’re joking…"" But the rest of the group enthusiastically agreed with Steve, so Lara resigned herself with a sigh. ""Fine, but hurry up. I want to get to the lake already.""

The friends walked through the small park in front of the library and up the sandstone steps. When they reached the door, they immediately noticed that it wasn’t locked—it was slightly ajar. ""Well, would you look at that!"" Dave exclaimed as he entered first. Lara shook her head, knowing there was no point in resisting. So, she followed Dave inside. The interior of the library was just as impressive as its exterior. High ceilings, rows upon rows of bookshelves, all filled with books. The ground floor had no ceiling; instead, the upper floor formed a ring around the central hall, supported by Corinthian-style sandstone columns. The floor was made of dark wood, and the room was flooded with light from the enormous windows, the sunbeams cutting through the dust particles swirling in the air. At night, the library was illuminated by three small chandeliers, which were now draped with cobwebs, symbolizing the time the building had stood empty. Tommy whistled in awe. ""I guess we could spend hours exploring here!"" ""Not a chance!"" Lara hissed. But even she couldn’t deny that the building was beautiful and she would have liked to browse around. It was just that the huge space radiated an eerie atmosphere, much like the rest of the small town.

After a few minutes of wandering, Dave’s voice echoed from the far end of the library. ""Come here! I think I found something!"" The rest of the group joined him. He was standing in front of a dark wooden desk, on which the remnants of an almost-burnt candle rested. Empty cans and water bottles were scattered around, along with a stained mattress and dozens of books piled up beside it. Dave held out a kind of leather folder to them. Lara read the inscription: ""To the one who finds this manuscript.""

""What’s this?"" Steve asked. ""Can’t you read? It’s a manuscript, you idiot,"" Tommy said. ""I can see that, but what’s it supposed to say?"" ""Maybe it explains what happened to Dunn’s Creek?"" Lara suggested. ""I think someone would have found it by now, don’t you?"" Dave replied. ""I guess the only way to find out is by reading it,"" Steve said finally. ""Give it here!""

He grabbed the manuscript from Dave’s hand and opened the folder. ""Shit, someone really put a lot of effort into this. Look at this! Pictures of the houses and people here, newspaper clippings, and—what’s this?"" He furrowed his brow. ""A diary?""

""Come on, read it aloud!"" Tommy urged. ""Can we just go already?"" Lara once again expressed her frustration. ""Never, not before we find out what’s written in the mysterious manuscript in the eerie, abandoned library of the mysterious ghost town,"" Dave said, adopting a mysterious voice, holding his flashlight under his chin.

""Come on, Lara, we’ll read it quickly and then leave, promise!"" Steve said. Lara sighed. She looked into her boyfriend’s eyes and saw how much fun he was having exploring this abandoned building and now holding this presumably historic and equally mysterious document. She sighed and gave in. ""Alright, but hurry up."" ""You’re the best!"" Steve beamed at her, kissed her, cleared his throat, and began reading:

 

**September 19**

Dunn's Creek was once a really nice little town located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. The location of our small town, surrounded by hills to the north, east, and west, and situated on the banks of the river that gave the town its name, Dunn Creek, used to provide the atmosphere of a perfect small-town idyll. No matter where you looked, the views of the surrounding hills and the pine forests that climb the Rockies ensured that you never grew tired of the scenery, even after decades of seeing it. I’ve experienced a lot here, even though the town is quite far from other settlements and not much exciting happens here. I was born here, took my first steps, spoke my first words here. I spent my school years here and worked as a librarian for 20 years. I made many friends here, and even got married. My parents were born and died in Dunn’s Creek, as did many other good people. This is home to me. And now, I know I will die here. How exactly, I don’t know. No one knew when it was time. In the past few months, our cozy little community has turned into a place of fear and suffering, and now, I am the last one still alive here. Since all electronic devices have become useless due to recent events, I decided to leave a message for anyone who will one day visit Dunn’s Creek and wonder why and how a town like this could fall apart. To whoever finds this manuscript, I have attached my diary entries that describe everything that happened, what I know, and also what I don’t know.

The end of the town began in February with the first strange occurrences described in my diary. At that time, no one knew that everything would go downhill, because everything seemed as it always had.

For example, there was Eliot Mercer, the stocky owner of the grocery store. He had recently made it his mission to chase away three 17-year-old friends, Danny Wilkow, Randy Marshall, and Stanley Wittaker, from his store, because they had recently made it a habit to steal a few cans of beer when no one was looking, which they would then drink on the hills surrounding Dunn’s Creek. However, Eliot’s wife, Linda Mercer, always told him not to get so worked up, as she clearly remembered how he was at that age and advised him to let Sheriff Caldwell handle the matter. But Eliot, who had known the three boys since they were little, didn’t really want to get them into trouble. He was a hot-tempered man but of fundamentally good nature.

Clara Davenport, the teacher, was a warm-hearted woman who was adored by her students because of her knowledge and understanding manner. Even though she was almost 60 by now, she still went to school every morning with as much energy as ever. Ralph, the eight-year-old son of Martha and Lucas Finnigan, particularly liked Miss Davenport and would often talk to her, which she found highly amusing because of his admiration and imagination.

Aaron and Joanne Blake didn’t have much work during the winter, but their work as farmers in the quiet town was always highly appreciated. I liked them both very much. They were my neighbors, and Aaron went to school with me and was also my best friend. We met at least once a week at Joe Harrington’s bar, where we played pool and drank a few beers. Joanne was also good friends with my wife before she passed away eight years ago. We talked a lot about her afterward, and I think Joanne was almost as sad about her death as I was.

As usual, you could find Sylvia Klein jogging with Mayor Ruth McAllister every weekend, a tradition they had maintained for years and did every Sunday morning without fail. But this February, which was particularly cold and snowy, Sylvia had caught pneumonia, which the town doctor, Peter O'Donnell, treated. His wife, Evelyn, was the pharmacist and very good friends with Sylvia. So, she secretly slipped Sylvia a little bottle of gin to help her recovery.

Howard Granger, the grumpy owner of the rarely visited gas station, usually sat in a rocking chair in front of his shop, either dozing, drinking beer, or grumpily barking at people who dared to stop at his station to fuel up. I don’t remember anyone really liking Howard, not even his wife, Hannah. Only John Harper would occasionally be seen talking to the bearded old man, but that was probably because John drank as much as Howard did, and thus they were kindred spirits. Unfortunately, this was at the expense of John’s 16-year-old daughter, Maggie, who had problems with her father’s drinking and would often join Danny Wilkow, Randy Marshall, and Stanley Wittaker’s group out of loneliness and boredom, since they were about the same age.

Pastor Whitfield was one of the kindest people I’ve ever met. After my wife passed, he gave me much support and invited me to his home for meals so I wouldn’t be so lonely. His sermons at church were well thought out and delivered, with a tendency towards optimism and the cooperation of all Dunn’s Creek residents. And the people lived according to his sermons.

Until February, when the events began that destroyed everything. I am writing this at the desk in the library, where I’ve worked for over 20 years and haven’t left in the past few weeks. I know what the recent signs mean. The end has come for me. In less than two hours, I will be dead, assuming my assumption about what will happen to me is correct. But whoever reads these lines should form their own opinion about what we’ve experienced and make their own judgment. The reports, which I have shortened by a few irrelevant lines and entries, will be hard to believe, but they are true. I’ve attached the pages with the most important events, starting with my diary entry from February 12 of this year.

**February 12**

Today, Walt Grady came into the library. I’m relieved that the old man has recovered so well, as I thought he was done for. But he seemed pretty lively, although the cold was bothering him. He borrowed a book about the history of Ancient Rome, a topic he can’t stop talking about. I think he had a discussion with Nate Klein. The two always argue about something. Walt didn’t seem quite right, though, because he told me he saw a man on the northern hill of Dunn’s Creek, past Howard’s gas station, who just disappeared. I think his medication isn’t properly adjusted; he gave me a generally confused impression, and such hallucinations might indicate a wrong dosage. Maybe I should tell Dr. O’Donnell, in case Walt gets sick again.

**February 18**

Lucas Finnigan brought me the mail today. He told me that his kids, Ralph and Emily, had been keeping their mother busy, as they wanted to play in the snow all day. Ralph apparently can’t stop talking about Miss Davenport, who seems to have taken a liking to him as well. I think it’s because Ralph has such a big imagination, which Miss Davenport finds amusing. He also recently told me that he now has a second teacher, but no one else seems to know him.

**February 20**

Unfortunately, Walt seems to have gotten worse on his walk to the library last week, as his wife Jessica brought me the book back today. I asked about Walt, but it doesn’t seem to be going well for him—his pneumonia seems to have come back. He also seems to be getting a bit paranoid, complaining that he feels watched all the time. It’s sad to see a good old man like Walt so sick. I told Linda to talk to Dr. O’Connell about Walt’s medication dosage.

**March 2**

It seems even Walt’s best friend, Nate, is having trouble talking to him. Walt keeps confusing him with someone he’s terrified of. It’s very uncharacteristic of him, considering he used to hunt alone in the mountains for weeks and could always defend himself. The fact that he’s now having panic attacks every time he looks out the window isn’t helping the situation. Walt’s medication seems to be properly dosed. It must be hard for Nate to watch what’s happening to his friend. I can’t even imagine how it would feel if Aaron were to yell at me in confusion and fear. After all, I’ve known him for over 40 years.

**March 12**

I’ve been feeling a bit off lately whenever I go outside. A little worried. It’s not like there’s anything specific that’s bothering me, but I have this feeling like I should be looking over my shoulder more often, only to find no one behind me. But it’s been a long, hard winter, and people’s moods have generally been worse. The darkness doesn’t help either. The light fog that has been hanging over the town since Saturday isn’t making things better. It’s time for spring. The sun will lift our spirits.

**March 13**

Walt Grady has passed away. Helen Roscoe told me this morning when I walked past her hotel. It hit me hard, because I liked the old man and had hoped he’d recover and share his vast knowledge of history with me. But I guess it’s for the best—he had been getting weaker in recent months. Jessica will be devastated. According to Helen, Walt fought and screamed as it neared the end. He seemed to have been terrified. I hope he finds peace now.

**March 14**

Eliot Mercer yelled at Danny Wilkow and his two friends in the middle of the street today. They seemed to have broken a window of his store, but they claimed it wasn’t them. It was quite a heated situation, and Linda had a hard time calming her angry husband and getting him back into the store. Admittedly, the three boys had been acting up for a while. But I don’t think they would intentionally damage property. After all, Eliot had always given them candy when he saw them on their way back from school. I don’t know why the three would want to harm him, as they’re good boys, despite their rebellious phase. I don’t understand why Eliot’s dog, Rowdy, didn’t bark when someone was messing around his store…

**March 17**

John Harper and Howard Granger, our two town drunks, celebrated St. Patrick’s Day in full force. By celebrated, I mean they were loudly and obviously drunk, shouting at each other in front of Howard’s gas station, which turned into quite a spectacle that drew a small, curious crowd. The people, myself included, watched the argument and the altercation with a mixture of embarrassment and amusement, but I found it rather sad how far the two of them had fallen. I only half understood what it was about. John accused Howard of stalking his daughter Maggie. I don’t know why he suspected Howard, but apparently, Maggie really is afraid to go outside. According to John, she feels like she’s being watched ever since she and Danny Wilkow’s gang came back from one of the hills, where they had been drinking beer. Maggie claims she saw someone standing in the fog and since then, she’s felt watched.

I have to admit, I’ve been feeling uneasy more and more lately. I’m not sure where it’s coming from, but I’m definitely not going to start a scene in public. \[...\]

**March 20**

My unease is slowly growing. I can’t help but constantly glance over my shoulder. As I was walking home after work today, I thought I saw someone standing on the hill behind the Randall farm. It was already dusk, so I’m not sure if I just imagined it, and the persistent fog might have contributed. But anyway, I thought I saw someone standing there, but when I looked more closely, the silhouette was gone. I remember that Walt, before he died, had told me he had seen someone on one of the hills. Maybe I should ask Dr. O’Connell if he’s setting my medication correctly. Of course, he would first have to prescribe me something.

**March 25**

Something strange happened today. I’m actually at a loss for words to explain it properly, and it sounds ridiculous when you talk about it. It’s about Maggie Harper. She had been feeling unwell and followed. Since her father John had publicly accused the gas station attendant, her paranoia had only worsened. In recent days, she had hardly been seen outside, yet she still felt watched, as John explained to us. This afternoon, I heard excited voices in front of the library. I opened the window and looked out onto the street, and saw Maggie accompanied by Danny, Stanley, and Randy. Maggie was obviously upset and disturbed, and the three boys were discussing and gesturing animatedly. When I asked if everything was okay, they called me downstairs because it was “hard to explain.” When I got downstairs, I asked Maggie what was wrong. She had her hands pressed to her eyes, clearly frightened, and with a trembling voice, she managed to say just two words: “My shadow!”

At first, I didn’t know what she meant. The sun was already quite low at that time, and I looked behind me. My body cast a long shadow, just like the boys did. But when I counted again, I froze. There were only four shadows, but we were five people. Maggie’s shadow was missing! I don’t know how that’s possible, but it doesn’t seem right.

Maggie noticed I was speechless, and it clearly terrified her even more. She mentioned something about the man on the hill taking her shadow, and now it was her turn, and she ran quickly home.

**March 28**

\[…\] Maggie has been sick for days, according to John. She saw another silhouette on the hills, this time even two. The poor girl is completely done for, and her shadow still hasn’t returned. \[…\] Yesterday, Aaron told me that all his clocks in the house stopped at exactly 2:17 AM. He and Joanne are a bit confused about it. Not just one, but all of them! I’m starting to get confused too. It’s been a strange few weeks.

**April 2**

Martin Harlow, our mechanic, was a little strange today too. He’s usually a cheerful, funny person and always ready for a joke. When I ran into him, he seemed worried, glancing at the northern hill of Dunn’s Creek repeatedly during our small talk. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days. When I asked if everything was okay, he just stared at me with a strange expression and walked off without saying another word. \[…\]

**April 19**

\[…\] Something is wrong here. The fog just won’t go away. More and more people are reporting one or two silhouettes in the fog on the hills. Tina Klein saw them yesterday, and George Larkin saw them today. The strange thing is, they don’t seem to do anything. If they’re strangers who’ve gotten lost and need help, why don’t they just come into the town and talk to someone? They just stand there in the fog, staring at people. If I hadn’t seen one of these silhouettes myself a few weeks ago, I’d be highly skeptical. And still, no one has been able to swear that someone was really standing there, because when you look closely, there’s no one.

Maggie obviously doesn’t speak anymore. She just sits by the window, staring out toward the hills, refusing meals. John had an argument with Danny, who apparently wanted to visit her. Maggie and the boy seem to have some sort of relationship, which John disapproves of. He told Danny that Maggie absolutely couldn’t have visitors, she was far too upset. \[…\]

**April 25**

Apparently, Jacob Miller’s cats have disappeared. Without a trace. All four of them. How can that happen? He lives next to the cemetery, of course, he’s the undertaker. But how likely is it that four animals would fall into open graves, as he assumes? Especially since there are no open graves, as no one has died. He reported seeing one of the figures in the fog between the gravestones the day before the cats disappeared. Who are these figures, and why don’t they show themselves? \[…\]

**April 29**

Maggie is gone! She wasn’t in her bed when John woke up this morning. He called Danny Wilkow, but he claimed he hadn’t seen Maggie in a week because John wouldn’t let him visit her. John stormed straight to Howard Granger’s gas station to confront him. Of course, Howard also claimed he hadn’t seen Maggie, but John wasn’t having it. When the situation started escalating, Sheriff Caldwell fortunately showed up to defuse the conflict. He took both John and Howard with him, and they’re now both at his station answering his questions. \[…\]

Postscript: I could swear I saw one of the silhouettes in the dark, standing behind the Blake’s farm, at the end of the field! So close to my house!

**May 3**

What’s going on here? I think we’re all losing our minds. In search of Maggie, various search teams have gone out to comb the area around the town. Lucas Finnigan, George Larkin, Marc Davenport, and Helen Roscoe planned to search the woods west of Dunn’s Creek. They drove down the road in George’s pickup truck, past the McLeods’ tailor shop. Behind the tailor shop, at the edge of town, they turned right onto the gravel road that leads to the water tower. But the road wasn’t there anymore! It was just gone. And I don’t mean that someone had removed the gravel and put in new soil. The road was gone, and grass and hedges had grown where it had been yesterday. Like it had never existed. Instead, a new path now led left, behind Garry Oak’s house, which was definitely not there before. Even Garry’s cherry tree was gone. I’m honestly not sure what to think anymore. \[…\]

I think after today, everyone in Dunn’s Creek realizes something’s wrong. People are tense. Maggie is still gone, and some feel it has something to do with one of the silhouettes. \[…\]

Aaron and Joanne were very quiet today. Of course, I told them I thought I saw one of the figures behind their field. They just nodded silently.

**May 9**

We’ve given up searching for Maggie. We’ve combed every place, but found no trace. John has been drinking more in the past few days and barely says anything anymore. The poor man has already been through enough in his life, and now his only child and last remaining family member has disappeared...

**May 12**

Since today, neither phones, televisions, radios, nor any other communication devices are working anymore. We are cut off from the outside world! We believe the figures have something to do with it, even though no one has ever seen them do anything other than stand and observe. People are seeing them more often now, often out of the corner of their eyes or in their peripheral vision. As soon as you look closer, they’re gone. They’ve also never been seen within the city limits, only on the hills and behind the Blake’s farm. There, they just stand, half-hidden in the fog.

We’ve planned a meeting at town hall tonight to discuss what to do next. I hope we can figure out how to get our old life back because right now, everyone is getting a little restless.

**May 13**

The meeting yesterday didn’t give us much except that we now have a better idea of the extent of what’s happening. Dozens of citizens, including the Finnigans and their children, the Harlows, old Nate Klein, Jessica Grady, Mayor McAllister, CJ Jameson, Mandy Glover, myself, and many others, have seen the figures in the last few weeks. Oddities like the disappearance of the road to the water tower were not isolated incidents. Just like with my neighbors, the Blakes, other households also had their clocks stop – all at 2:17. Leona Holt’s shadow disappeared just like Maggie Harper’s, as her students had shockingly noticed during the lunch break. Several animals, mostly cats and livestock from the two ranches, have simply disappeared without a trace, some from locked barns. Emory Knox, while working as an electrician at the Kirkland’s house, apparently had some sort of seizure a couple of days ago. The Kirklands said he stood motionless for exactly 17 minutes. Not a hair moved, not even a blink or breath. Emory was frozen in mid-sentence, mid-motion, and exactly 17 minutes later, thawed and finished his sentence as if nothing had happened. He has no memory of it.

Ralph and Emily Finnigan have been staring out the window toward the hills since yesterday, acting unusually quiet and apathetic. Lucas and Martha are scared for their children. When I think of how Maggie was before her disappearance, I would be scared too if I were in their shoes. \[…\]

Sam Barrows, who owns the fishing store near the school, has been talking a lot about conspiracies and government experiments. But no one really believes him, because nothing can be explained that way. \[…\]

Most of us now believe that the figures on the hills aren’t strangers looking for help. What (or rather, who) they are, no one can explain. It’s hard for me to believe that there are creatures out there that aren’t human, but no amount of thinking has provided any insight into what we’re dealing with. Despite the lingering skepticism of some citizens, we’ve concluded that we have to do something. But no one really knows what, because we don’t even know what’s happening...

**May 23**

\[…\] Ralph and Emily Finnigan haven’t stopped staring out the window, which is scaring their parents. Last night, they packed their things and left early this morning. They planned to head toward Washington to seek help and get their children to safety. I can’t blame them. This morning at 7 AM, I saw them leave as I was on my way to the library. They drove west, past the tailor’s shop and the now non-existent path.

What happened next makes me doubt whether we can change anything about the situation. Around 6 PM, the Finnigans were seen returning to Dunn’s Creek, coming from the east. I don’t know how it’s possible to drive west and then hours later come back from the opposite direction to the starting point. What makes it even stranger is what Lucas told me when I asked what had happened. They had driven normally along the road without turning. When leaving the town, Martha had seen two figures on the hills, so the Finnigans had stepped on the gas to get away from Dunn’s Creek as quickly as possible. But after 45 minutes, they simply drove back into the town from the opposite direction. After 45 minutes! This means, according to their account, that they must have re-entered the town by no later than 8 AM. But they were only seen again just after 6 PM! Ten hours later!

What happened during those ten hours, neither Lucas nor Martha could explain. Just like they couldn’t explain how they made it back to Dunn’s Creek. \[…\]

**May 30**

Now the Finnigans have all disappeared. Lucas, Martha, Emily, and Ralph. No sign of where they went. Since Lucas was the mailman and no one received their mail that morning, their disappearance was noticed quite quickly. But that doesn’t make it any less strange. Laura Harlow, Martha’s best friend, knocked on the door of the Finnigans’ house, but received no answer. She went to the back door and looked inside. What she saw didn’t make any sense, so she called Sheriff Caldwell for help, who gained access to the house.

All the beds were empty. The fridge was open. The water in the bathroom was running. A half-eaten toast sat on a plate, and milk was standing open beside a cup of coffee, which hadn’t been poured into it yet. All in all, it seemed like the Finnigans had vanished into thin air. At first, I thought maybe they had gone out of town again and made it this time. But their car was still in the driveway. No one saw them leave, not the Jacksons across the street nor Miss Miller, who always spies out the windows and never misses anything. Since no one saw them leave, we assume they were somehow abducted. We’ve formed search teams again to find the family. I’ll start searching in the northern part of town with Aaron and the pastor. The thought of going into the hills, where we often see the figures, doesn’t sit well with me, but we may have no choice. The Finnigans would do the same for us. \[…\]

I’ve started looking for literature in the library that might shed light on what’s happening here. So far, I haven’t found anything that matches the description of the silhouettes. But no one has really seen the beings to this day. They remain hidden in the peripheral field of vision, so you can’t look at them directly. They are almost like the fog in which they hide. I feel like they want us to know they’re there. But what their presence means, I can’t imagine.

**June 4**

No trace of the Finnigans. We’ve stopped searching again. Now five people are gone, including three children. People are slowly becoming suspicious and hardly leave their homes anymore. Rowdy, the Mercers’ dog, has now also disappeared. No trace, of course.

Clara Davenport claims to have seen one of the figures in the fog on the school roof. This would be the first time they’ve dared to come within the city limits. Miss Holt’s shadow still hasn’t returned. She has locked herself in her apartment for days and won’t open the door for anyone. When Eliot Mercer pressed his face against the window and peeked through a gap in the curtains into the Holts’ living room, he saw Miss Holt frantically scribbling and drawing symbols on the walls, although he couldn’t identify the symbols and writings.

My paranoia is getting worse too. Although I’ve only seen the figures a few times (Dave Calloway sees them almost every day now), I barely dare to walk home from the library alone. I pray every time I go outside that I still have a shadow.

**June 7**

They’ve taken Miss Holt. She has vanished without a trace. She was last seen by her students when she went into her office just before class began, but she never appeared again. Sheriff Caldwell gained access to her house and found almost every wall and ceiling smeared with strange symbols and markings. No one can say exactly what Miss Holt wrote. But I have a bad feeling that it might be a warning or something like that. \[…\]

Aaron told me earlier that Joanne no longer dares to look out the window. The fog is getting thicker, and she feels the two figures are standing there watching her. That thought sends a chill down my spine. I asked Aaron if we should sleep in one house together to keep each other company, but he didn’t seem too happy about the suggestion. \[…\]

Postscript: George Larkin hasn’t returned to his wife today, and no one has found him yet. That’s two people in one day who’ve disappeared without a trace, at least if I’m right in assuming that what happened to him is the same as what happened to Miss Holt and the others (which I believe). I don’t know what to think anymore. I’ve heard that CJ Jameson, Dave Calloway, and Martin Harlow plan to go out tomorrow and confront the figures on the hills. Of course, there have been some protests and discussions, but I think everyone realizes that we have to act if we want the situation to turn around. I pray the three of them return safely.

**June 8**

They didn’t return. Of course, they didn’t. Three men, just gone. We found their rifles at the foot of the northern hill, lined up against an old, crumbling wall of the adjacent cemetery. Next to them lay their clothes and shoes, neatly folded on the ground. There’s no trace of the three men. The figures watched us as we gathered CJ’s, Marc’s, and Dave’s belongings to return to their families. Searching is pointless. We won’t find them anyway. \[…\]",1,1735121954.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False
