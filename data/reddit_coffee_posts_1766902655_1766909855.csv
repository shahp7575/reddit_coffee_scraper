Said “there was a coffee spill” but failed to disclose it was onto my MacBook until I saw the computer glitching and put it together. Now that I paid $120 to get it diagnosed as fried, this person states I’m responsible for bringing a personal item to work and “offers to Venmo $275.” I thought I knew gaslighting before, now I really get it.

1pxm0wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1pxm0wg/how_do_i_hide_coffee_from_my_mother/,How do I hide coffee from my mother?,"I am absolutely obsessed with coffee and I need it to fuel my study sessions and give me a sense of joy in my mundane, mid life. 

However, my mother is very overbearing and paranoid. I can consume 500-700mg of caffeine in a day and feel perfectly fine but she thinks I'll get a heart attack after one coffee. 

I have tried to switch to tea but that a) is not nearly strong enough and makes me sad and b) she regulates that and yells at me for a minimum of two hours. 

Any time she sees me have a caffeinated beverage, she gives me the same spiel of 'one cup in the morning and one cup in the evening' and talks abt how I will die or smth if I have black coffee instead of her goofy milk coffee with 5 tbsp of sugar and 1 particle of instant coffee.

I'm thinking of ordering the Continental instant coffee and hiding it in my room but she literally starts checking my room and can even fucking smell the coffee beans (I don't know how). 

How can I hide the coffee from her?

1pxm0n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1pxm0n8/met_a_guy_on_grindr_theres_mutual_interest_and_we/,"Met a guy on Grindr, there’s mutual interest and we have a date tomorrow, but I’m overthinking because he still has the app open. Should I still go?","Hi everyone ☺️

I need to vent and get some perspective because I’m really nervous and overthinking everything. A few weeks ago a guy messaged me on Grindr after seeing me at the train station. We started talking; at first I was the one initiating more and he’d reply fastly sometimes ( he works crazy shifts nights, 24-hour stretches, etc.). It used to bother me seeing him online but taking forever to reply sometimes.

Over time things got better: he started suggesting specific plans (movies, dinner, healthy food place, studying together at the library), said he wanted to get to know me properly and also have sex. He told me he ended a relationship 3 months ago, that he’s consciously processing the breakup but he’s open to something new if it feels right.

During Christmas there were some intense days: on Christmas Eve he sent me live photos of his family dinner, said things like “wish you were here,” “I want to hug you,” etc. Other days were lighter, more small talk.

Grindr was giving me a lot of anxiety (a lot of guys talking to me, having attention that I don’t really need, checking if he was online, imagining him talking to others), so yesterday I told him I was going to delete it because it was wearing me out mentally. He asked for my phone number, said I could delete the app if I wanted to. I gave it to him, then deleted the app and my profile.

A few hours passed without him texting me and I felt a little bit frustrated. Eventually that night he texted “Hey, it’s Carlos.” I replied affectionately but we didn’t continue the conversation.

Today barely anything, just a couple of banal messages.
Tomorrow we have a date: just coffee.

What worries me:
	•	He still has Grindr open.
	•	I don’t know how many other people he might be talking to.
	•	He did say he was thinking about deleting the app, but he hasn’t yet.

On the other hand, there is interest. What do you think?Should I go on the date tomorrow even though he still has Grindr?
Should I bring up the app/exclusivity topic on the date or wait?
Is it normal that he hasn’t deleted it yet?
Am I being too intense? (I think so, I’ve never had a boyfriend. It is really difficult to me to have interest in somebody).

Thanks in advance for your opinions, I really need an outside view.

1pxlzrm,https://i.redd.it/qq844bjuhw9g1.png,The Coffee Compass by BaristaHustle,"I present you the coffee compass by BaristaHustle! The single most useful reference for my coffee brewing.

If you ever feel like your coffee isn't tasting perfectly balanced and delicious:  
  
1) Find the negative flavors that you're experiencing on the taste circle

2) Then from that direction go towards the center of the compass for directions on how to fix that.



E.g. Today my pour over coffee (20g coffee, 350ml water) was feeling a slightly powdery on my tongue and a bit tasteless/empty as well (which is on the bottom right side of the taste circle), so I should look towards the center of the compass from that bottom right point, i.e facing top left where you find ""Extract Less, More Coffee"".

I'll do just that. Instead of adding more coffee, I could reduce the water to about 320ml, which has the same net effect. I will also adjust the grind size to be ever so slightly coarser so it extracts less.

To make it interesting, I can report back tomorrow with this if you wish since I'm not consuming any more caffeine today.

Hope this helps :)",1,1766909024.0,pakcoffee,0,1.0,False

I can't find any job and am thinking about changing careers.,"The company I worked for launched a restructuring process. They closed the entire art department and fired a lot of people. I worked on content for a large commercial AAA game. Salaries in the company for the same position have fallen by 20-30% over the past three years. 

I was constantly working overtime without pay to meet deadlines. Working 9-14 hours at the computer every day exhausted me, but I held on. I gained excess weight and became apathetic towards computer games. My eyesight has deteriorated. I was sleep-deprived almost every day and also developed a coffee addiction. After work I didn't even go near my home PC. Despite all this, I worked like this for several years. I have reached the middle level, but at what cost? 

Now I am unemployed due to the decisions of effective managers. I can't find a job because there are almost none. My health has worsened and the money that remains will only last for six months. I am writing this to show you what awaits you in this area. I think about changing my profession every day because there are no prospects and there won't be any.  Everything will get worse and worse. You will be replaced either by an AI or a senior who agreed to a low-paying junior level job. If you live in a country you want to escape from, don't think 3D will solve this problem.

How do I make friends so I don't transLOSEit?,"This is all so random, ranting crap. Someone please read and respond. Solidarity, advice, and even some very gentle tough love welcome. ❤️  tw mentioning of past DV & CA

I had the realization the other day that I have no experience of true ""girlhood"" or ""womanhood"" with special bonds like I see my peers have. 

I'm using this alt account bc my main has a lot of details that my abuser could maybe link together ❤️ sorry for the extra caution. 

Backstory

My kiddo is 6.5 and I homeschool because kiddo has a huge phobia to something that is literally everywhere. And this phobia really interfered with how kiddo socialized at achool, the school refused to help with his accommodations through the IEP, and the bullying from kiddos disability was all too much and NEVER handled. Homeschooling has been a breeze compared to public brick and mortar. I mean, the years he was in public schooling (pre or real) constantly getting bullied, coming home with completely blank papers/schoolwork assignments. It was hell. Kiddo has ptsd from dad, so there are special needs here considering there is also thr audhd too..

Anyways, idk if it's because my home is empty after hosting Christmas for a few members our most close, loving, and accommodating family members, but depression is hitting me hard (and I know its that time of year, too.) 

I'm turning 31 in 2026. I can't believe I've spent the last decade being abused (not by choice, the system failed to protect me for some of my abusers...... extracurricular activities). 

Many of my friends have died due to street violence (I was lucky to leave that area a while back.)

I've never been a bridesmaid. Never been on a girls trip. I have 2 friends that are alive and I see them about 4 times a year because we are all very busy pursuing different things (working ft, advanced schooling, kids, you name it). I've actually only been to 2 weddings as an adult and only because I was a guys +1. 

I'm finally in a state where I can start truly healing from the abuse. Ive even been doing weekly empowerment counseling/lessons, for the DV. 

But I have no idea how to make friends, or even join moms groups, when my kiddo has this huge phobia. They do therapy weekly too and thankfully exposure therapy has been helping, but we're having a regression due to a ptsd flare. Not just that, but where's the time with homeschooling and chronic illness? 

I am just tired of being alone. I don't even mean in a romantic way (I have no sex drive, I'm in menopause). I know other women my age (with kids or not) will go to target (🤢), brunch, or coffee together to catch up. I don't even really have anyone to do that with. 

I'm incredibly blessed to be able to be involved in my kiddos education hands on, I'm blessed to be the majority parent and watch my kiddo grow and have lovely memories together every day. AND I'm tired. My abuser is his abuser, because it's also his dad, so I can't ask him for help to shoulder even the tiniest burden. 

I've been working on healing for so long. And I think it'll be a lifelong journey. (He nearly unalived me in front of our kid, he then stalked us for years). 

And even though libido is low, sometimes I do wish I had a partner. Before menopause, I felt a lot of stigma when trying to date as a single mom. But now, all those men are dating single moms. I had a long term boyfriend for ~ 2 years, we had plans to marry, but he left because of some depression his ADHD meds caused.. we've been split for a year now. I hate that I fear and crave a male companion all at the same time. But I am so fucking lonely. And I am a great woman on paper (less the being a victim of stalking/dv in the past) - strong, self- reliant (maybe to a fault) ambitious, I cook, I clean, I have great life skills & I am well educated. 

I am really starting to feel like the problem is me, because no one seems to love me other than my kid, and obviously that's great that they do love me and appreciate my efforts. But if I am already doing all the things a man wants in a partner (self sufficient, hardworking, knowledgeable, kind, caring, cooks, cleans, is pretty) why does no one want me long term? I am autistic and highly traumatized since birth so my social skills were never the best, I'm better socializing as an adult but I'm just so tired and nearly translucent, it feels like a chore to even chat to people on apps like bumble (for friends) or small talk in the rare times I am able to get out with only other adults. 

TLDR: Aside from joining knitting or other hobby related groups, doing occasional karaoke and open mic nights (already do these things sometimes),  what can I do to help myself?? My support system is small, only my mother will do babysitting for my kiddo. I know I could look into respite care, too, which I will inquire about this Monday. We (kiddo and i) frequent parks, zoos, libraries, and nature trails together. 

I'm just so tired of not having consistent adult interaction. I don't mean everyday, or even every week. Its.. I just.. It feels like my brain is losing braincells. And it probably is because isolation is really bad for a persons health. 

Sorry for the long, disconnected rant. I'm tired, and I've been sobbing since kiddo was sleeping because I'm just tired of being alone. ",1,1766908957.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

1pxlvco,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1pxlvco/wasteland_etiquette_and_tips_for_new_wastelanders/,Wasteland Etiquette and Tips for New Wastelanders,"Welcome new Wastelanders! I've definitely noticed a number of new players in the last week or so. This prompted me to make a post I thought I would make you getting into 76 maybe a little easier since I've noticed a few people not having a clue what to do, and we all were there once. 

WASTELAND ETIQUETTE AND TIPS:
Firstly, PLEASE don't start events the moment you get to them. There are a number of reasons for this, chiefly, so other people have time to join. I bring this up first because in the past 48 hours I've seen probably a dozen events started solo by a character level 30 or less, and having the even fail or nearly fail before myself and others could join (i.e. Eviction Notice, Radiation Rumble, etc). This also applied to the new hunts as well and Encryptid. Please do not start these events unless you yourself supplied the materials. A level 36 on my own public team did this earlier, only to get a very negative response from the material supplier, so please, just be patient. 

Please, also, do not openly ask for loot. Us older Wastelanders will GLADLY give stuff to low levels and we do so frequently, but I know I speak for myself and others in my circle who don't like brazenly being asked for stuff. I know some aren't bothered by this, so I suppose its not a hard rule, but it will dissuade some from dropping you stuff. Also, side note, if you see my screen name (Thee_Rage on PS5, though not currently accepting FR) and happen to run into me at my camp, throw me the Wave emote followed by teabagging and I'll know you seen this and I'll hook you up with some goodies.

Check the Whitespring Station donation box regularly. This is the #1 hot spot for players to drop excess loot. Traders, such as myself, generally use Whitespring Station as a meeting point for trades, and alot of us have camps there or near there, and we will often donate unwanted items into that red box. This is a great way to get plans, extra stimpacks, ammo, etc. Other donation boxes that are good to check are the ones directly outside of the vault, The Wayward, Watoga Station, Foundation, Crater and occasionally Nuka World.

Don't be shy about grabbing resources from resource generators at player camps. Most of us leave most of our generators unlocked, though a select few may be locked down. I, myself, always keep my coffee locked, but everything else is fair game. I feel like this one should go without saying, but I've had players even as high as level 800 asking me if they can take stuff from my camp. If it ain't locked, don't ask. Just take it. 

Please, please, please join public teams. There is nothing I hate more than being at an event with sub level 100 players who aren't on a public team who aren't benefiting from shared XP with their team. Don't be afraid to join a team with players very high leveled. Again, speaking for myself and my circle, we like helping new players level.

They didn't actually do that, its a awesome bug that occasionally will just kick you from a team during a disconnect.

Recently divorced, 57M, looking to make some friends in the 40-60 range, specifically women, since I connect better conversationally.

What I'm hoping for: someone to grab coffee with, check out restaurants (I'm still mapping the good ones), catch a movie, or hit the trails around here. Low-key stuff. No agenda beyond enjoying good company and conversation.

A bit about me: I'm a nerd at heart. High curiosity about science, philosophy, and the natural world. I cook, and I like doing it well (bonus points if you have ever used a sous vide machine). I enjoy a good hike, and we're spoiled for options around here. The Centennial Trail is my go-to for a long walk and good conversation. I'd rather have a two-hour discussion about something weird and interesting than make small talk about the weather.

If any of that sounds good to you, feel free to drop me a message. I make no promises about being stuck in the classification of normal, but I'm good company.",2,1766908507.0,LakeStevens,0,1.0,False

So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes',. Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

I used to think that once the convenience-store job was gone, life would instantly turn into ""on the run.""

No day or night. No normalcy. Just hiding and running.

But it didn't.

The waking world kept moving at its own pace. Streetlights turned on on schedule. Garbage trucks came on schedule. Convenience stores ran promotions on schedule. At two in the morning, people still lined up for hot coffee and a sandwich—like the world had never collapsed.

I stood at a street corner, fingers clenched hard around the edge of my coat. The spot on my chest felt faintly warm—not the scalding pull of the Rose that tried to drag you away, but something steadier, stickier. Like someone had tied a line to me and was slowly reeling me back to a place.

Silent Man walked beside me, slower than usual. His cap was pulled low, but it couldn't hide the posture he always carried—*if anything moves, I'll be in front of you first.*

Sethiel walked ahead. It looked like he was guiding us, but it also looked like he was simply walking his own road. Every so often he glanced back. No impatience. More like he was observing—watching whether we could walk down an ordinary street and still look like ordinary people.

""Where exactly are you taking us?"" I finally asked.

Sethiel turned his head, the corner of his mouth lifting.

""To work,"" he said, as if it were obvious.

Silent Man frowned. ""You don't need—""

""She does,"" Sethiel cut him off, like he couldn't believe he was that naïve. ""You want to get to that point on the map, you need travel money. You're not heroes. You're broke people in the waking world.""

I almost laughed.

It was completely unromantic—and completely true.

And weirdly, hearing the words *broke people in the waking world* made me feel safer. It was proof I had actually lived here.

We stopped in front of a storefront.

The sign was simple, white letters on black: **ROSE INK**.A wind chime hung by the door. A handwritten note was taped to the glass:

**Walk-ins available today.**

A tattoo shop.

I stood there and my heart jumped—not because I was scared of pain, but because something old, far away, got tapped lightly.

Sethiel pushed the door open like he lived there. The chime rang once, clean and bright. Inside, the lighting was warm, like late afternoon.

The place was *too* clean. Design sheets hung on the wall—good line work, gothic-leaning but not over the top. The air smelled of disinfectant, and a faint floral note—almost like roses, but not quite. Not perfume. Something real.

""You… run a tattoo shop in the waking world?"" I asked.

Sethiel took off his coat and hung it up, like I'd asked whether water was wet.

""Been doing it a long time,"" he said. ""What, you thought all I do is swing a sword in the Rose Court?""

Silent Man stayed near the door, eyes sweeping the shop like he was checking for ambush points.

""Is it safe?"" he asked.

Sethiel glanced at him. ""For now.""

""You're not Alliance anymore,"" I said quietly.

He smiled. ""Exactly why it's *for now*.""

He went behind the counter and pulled out a small box—like it was just another tool.

But the warmth in my chest flared a little.

""You'll come back,"" he said suddenly.

I blinked. ""What?""

He looked up at me. His tone was flat, like he'd already run the numbers.

""Tattoos fade,"" he said. ""That rose on your chest? It won't stay forever without touch-ups. Bloodline sensing is too vague. If you wait for it, you'll wait forever. You walk in on your own—that's the only sure thing.""

My throat tightened.

And in that instant, I remembered being very, very small.

Back then I had no concept of ""Rose War,"" no ""process,"" no ""reset."" I was just a normal kid who thought my parents were different—not louder or stricter, just… *contained*, like they were always holding something down.

That day, they took me into a tattoo shop.

I was terrified.

""Will it hurt?"" I asked.

My mother stroked my hair.

""It will,"" she said honestly. ""But you'll remember who you are.""

My father added, ""This isn't body art. It's a mark of a people.""

I didn't understand what a ""mark"" meant. I only knew the rose drawn on my chest was beautiful, like a secret.

I used to think that after getting that rose tattooed there, my life would flip upside down—like a prince would come find me, or I'd turn into some superhero.

But my ordinary life stayed ordinary. So dull it made me anxious. Nothing changed.

For years I wanted to tell my parents it was all bullshit—just a pretty tattoo.

Now I knew.

That rose would become a real mark. It would become the Rose Memory's way of locating me. It would become the world's method of finding my throat.

Under the tattoo shop lights, a ridiculous thought hit me—

So I'd been prepared since childhood.

But I also knew my parents hadn't told me everything. It wasn't as simple as letting the Rose Memory tag me.

""So we're working here?"" I asked, trying to crush the emotion under sarcasm.

Sethiel nodded, like he'd just handed me a normal part-time shift.

""You're front desk,"" he said. ""Learn sterilization, reception, payments.""

I looked at Silent Man.

Sethiel looked at Silent Man too—and then, like he'd remembered something funny, his smile slowly sharpened.

""And you,"" he said to Silent Man. ""Door.""

Silent Man frowned. ""Me?""

""Bring customers in,"" Sethiel said, totally serious. ""Your face is wasted otherwise.""

I nearly choked.

Silent Man's expression turned into something unclassifiable. He looked at me like he wanted help and like he was trying not to.

""I don't—""

Sethiel opened a storage bin under the counter and lifted out a bundle of fabric.

A… cat mascot suit.

The big kind. Cute. Huge head. Round eyes. Wobbly walk.

I stared at it. My brain went blank for two seconds.

""You're serious?"" Silent Man's voice dropped into a near-growl.

""Completely."" Sethiel shoved the suit into his arms. ""You stand outside. Wave. Act cute. Don't talk. You're good at being silent, aren't you?""

I bit my lip hard to keep from laughing.

Silent Man glanced at me. Shame. Resignation. And a kind of grim resolve—like dying would be easier than wearing this.

I almost said, *He doesn't have to do that.*

Then Sethiel cut it off with one sentence:

""You need travel money,"" he said. ""And you need him alive.""

I went quiet.

It was brutal. And accurate.

In the end, Silent Man put it on.

The moment he stepped outside, I almost lost it.

Not because he looked ridiculous—because he looked *too wrong for cute.*

He stood there, the head comically huge, proportions oddly adorable. And yet his eyes—those deep, unreadable eyes—showing through the suit's holes gave the whole thing a strange *cold, handsome* vibe.

Like a high-end cat who didn't want to work, but had been forced to.

Sethiel stood beside me like an artist admiring his own work, smugly satisfied.

""See,"" he said. ""One of human society's weapons: looks.""

I didn't bother replying. I grabbed a registration clipboard and pretended I was busy.

Within half an hour, people actually came in.

First were two college girls. They stopped outside, saw Silent Man, laughed so hard they could barely breathe, and started filming. Silent Man stiffly lifted a paw and waved the way Sethiel had instructed.

His wave looked like a death sentence being read aloud.

The girls shrieked, ""So cute!""

Then they walked straight in.

After that came a few office workers in suits. They were walking fast—until they saw the ""cold handsome cat."" They stopped, eyes lighting up instantly.

At the front desk, I gripped my pen a little too tightly.

I thought I wouldn't care. Our problem wasn't ""girls like him."" Our problem was ""the world wants us dead.""

But watching them crowd around him—laughing, filming, calling him ""handsome kitty""—made something prickly form in my chest.

Not the mark.

Something dumber.

Something unreasonable.

Sethiel leaned in beside me and asked quietly, ""Jealous?""

I almost threw the pen.

""Shut up,"" I hissed.

He smiled like he'd caught me.

""So you can do it too,"" he said. ""I thought you only knew how to head butt the world.""

I glared at him.

He didn't flinch. He just leaned on the counter like it was casual conversation.

""This is good,"" he said. ""You still look human.""

I froze.

That sentence was too gentle—too gentle for him.

I wanted to argue, but suddenly I didn't know what tone to argue in.

After another round outside, Silent Man finally came back in during a lull. When he lifted the oversized head off, his forehead was damp with sweat. Hair stuck to his skin. The heat had pulled a faint color into his pale face.

He looked at me like he wanted to say something.

""Embarrassing?"" I spoke first, keeping my voice flat on purpose, like I didn't care.

He paused, then said quietly, ""…You laughed.""

I choked on the words.

I *had* laughed. Almost died laughing.

His gaze deepened, like he was confirming something.

""When you laugh,"" he said, ""you look more like yourself.""

I didn't know how to answer.

That stupid sour feeling in my chest got messier, like someone had brushed it with a fingertip.

Sethiel drawled from the side, ""Congratulations. You're back in the core subjects of human society—emotion and money.""

I raised the clipboard like I was going to smash him with it.

He dodged with a grin, like he was provoking me on purpose—keeping me angry enough to stay alive.

The afternoon passed fast.

We did normal things—sterilizing, logging, charging, organizing tools. Silent Man did several shifts outside. He went from stiff, to numb, to—at the end—actually wobbling the mascot head a little, as if he were performing a real cat.

That stupid sour feeling rose again.

I hated myself for being immature.

But I couldn't stop it.

By evening, the customers thinned out.

The shop was quiet. The light softened, like a blanket thrown over the day's noise.

I put the last sterilized tools away. When I looked up, Sethiel was at the door, staring outside.

He wasn't smiling.

The sarcasm had been put away.

The air turned quiet in a way that felt wrong.

""What is it?"" I asked.

Sethiel didn't answer immediately. He lifted a hand and steadied the wind chime so it wouldn't ring.

Then the shadow outside the glass shifted.

Someone was standing there.

Not an ordinary customer.

The person wore normal clothes, looked like anyone on the street—yet something was off. Too clean. Like data that had been processed until no noise remained.

His gaze landed on us, paused—like confirmation—then he pushed the door open.

The chime should have rung.

But Sethiel's hand held it down.

So the entry was silent.

Silence that made my back go cold.

""Rose Envoy,"" Silent Man murmured, the warning in his voice snapping to full.

My palm dampened.

The man stood in the center of the shop and nodded politely.

""Apologies for the interruption,"" he said. ""I'm here to invite you to negotiations.""

Sethiel smiled—no warmth in it.

""Negotiations?"" he asked. ""You process-creatures negotiate now?""

The Rose Envoy's expression didn't change, like he'd predicted the mockery.

""Not every individual prefers endless war,"" he said. ""Some individuals… have begun to think. Have begun to grow weary.""

My heart jolted.

That line didn't belong in an envoy's mouth.

Yet he said it too calmly to sound like a lie.

""I know you don't believe me,"" he added. ""So I offer a method.""

Sethiel tilted his head. ""Oh?""

The Rose Envoy looked straight at him, proposing a condition old and direct.

""We negotiate,"" he said. ""But first—verification.""

Sethiel's eyes sharpened.

""How do you verify?"" I asked.

The Rose Envoy paused, choosing words.

""In the way you are accustomed to,"" he said.

""Duel.""

The air inside the shop tightened.

Silent Man stepped forward half a pace, instinctively shielding me.

Sethiel lifted a hand, signaling him not to move.

He stared at the Rose Envoy and spoke softly—soft enough to sound like a basic fact.

""I don't believe words,"" Sethiel said. ""In a duel, I can read what someone is.""

The Rose Envoy nodded, accepting the rule.

""Then by the old rules,"" he said.

I looked at Sethiel and realized—

We'd only just sat down inside something like ordinary life.

We'd only just tasted what normal felt like.

And the world had already reached in to take it.

Sethiel placed his hand on the door handle and turned it lightly.

The lock clicked.

He looked back at me.

""Don't be afraid,"" he said, casually—like saying *water's in the fridge.* ""People who want to negotiate should be willing to bleed, first.""

Silent Man's breathing grew heavier, something instinctive waking up.

I stood under the tattoo shop lights, and the rose on my chest warmed slightly—reminding me:

That flower was never decoration.

It was a tag.

It was also an entrance.

Outside, the city lights still glowed.

Inside, normal life began to warp.

The Rose Envoy lifted his head, expression calm.

""Please,"" he said.

Sethiel smiled like he'd finally found something worth playing with.

""Fine,"" he said. ""Let me see whether your 'weariness' is humanity—""

""—or a more precise kind of calculation.""

Then, at the same time, the Rose Envoy and Sethiel said:

You can't fight the tax terrorism and harassment by ITD Babus, but this is the only thing you can do to somewhat get back at the system. MINIMALIST life & ZERO to no consumption besides basic necessities.","You know how the ITD is harassing innocent middle class salaried people with threatening messages and intimidation, even though you have done nothing wrong. Not much you can do about it, as you neither have the money, time, energy or resources to fight this corrupt system and babus.

But what you can do is to not contribute to the economy and brainless consumerism by not spending and buying things besides the basic necessities like food, clothing and shelter and medical insurance.

Monday to Friday, work like a dog pay your taxes and just rot on your bed on evenings and weekends. Or go out to do something free like a walk in your neighborhood park, beach etc without spending anything.

Do not go out for anything like movies, restaurants, dramas, sightseeing, travel, swiggy, zomato, ola, uber, blinkit, instamart  etc. 

Don't even buy groceries from big supermarket like DMart, Reliance Smart etc or through Quick Commerce Apps. Just buy from local Nirvana stores, even though you might spend a few pennies more.

Also just eat basic home food like Daal, Chawal, Roti, fruits, veggies - no need for fancy food or even chai or coffee. A cup of hot water is enough instead of Chai/coffee. No need for milk, butter, cheese either.

Don't buy FMCG - Fast Moving Consumer Goods and ultra processed food like chips, namkeens, farsan, mithai , KFC, McDonald's etc.

No need for the latest phones, TV, gadgets, car , shoes, clothes-  try to stretch and use your existing old stuff as much as possible or repair it if broken, instead of replacing it.

No need for expensive OTT like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Jio Hot star etc. Free You Tube is more than enough.

Stop watching the nonsense Tata IPL and International Indian Cricket matches on TV, will largely reduce their ad revenue. Same for Bollywood movies. No need for socials like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn etc will largely reduce their ad revenue.

Total Digital detox and boycott consumerism.

I have started doing this and never been happier. Saving lots of money, Babus not collecting money from us in form of GST.

If I want to meet friends we just meet at a local park, or nukkad or local katta. Not at some Starbucks or restaurant. Or at the most we have a cutting chai at some local tapri.

1pxlqxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1pxlqxn/lpr_protocol_medicine_food_lifestyle_that_reduces/,"LPR Protocol - medicine, food, lifestyle - that reduces my symptoms by 95% (tough pill to swallow)","# My LPR Story, Structured and Explained

# 1) How it started

In **2022**, after a **severe URI**, I had **weeks of painful coughing** and suspected bronchitis. After that, I started noticing **flare-ups after meals** and **in the morning after waking up**.

Every morning, I had **painful coughing with mucus for 20–30 minutes**. I also developed a **globus feeling** and **hoarseness all day**, especially after meals—though it was basically a constant baseline of **globus and throat pain**.

# 2) What I tried and what I researched

# PPIs

I took a **PPI consistently for 12 weeks**. It only caused **stomach pain** and **didn’t help**.

# Gastroscopy

My gastroscopy showed **ulcers in the esophagus**.

# 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring

I did a **24-hour pH-impedance test** (measuring acidic, mildly acidic, and non-acidic reflux). It showed **no abnormal reflux activity**.

# Diet: Jamie Koufman

I followed the **Jamie Koufman diet religiously** for **several months**, and it **did not help**.

# Amitriptyline

Amitriptyline **didn’t work for me**. My globus sensation got even stronger and developed into a **severe, consistent painful feeling**. That period was **one of the worst**.

# Painkillers (opioids and NSAIDs)

Common painkillers like **opioids and NSAIDs** also **didn’t work** for this kind of pain. I tried them.

* **Codeine** only made me **drowsy** and lowered my **sex drive**.
* **NSAIDs** can even make **LPR worse**.

My conclusion from this is that the pain is **neuropathic**. Only drugs like **pregabalin** help—but even that is not a miracle. I still have to stick to the **super annoying diet and lifestyle protocols**.

# 3) What reduced my symptoms by 95% (when I do it consistently)

# Pregabalin

**Pregabalin 150 mg, three times per day**, taken in **8-hour intervals** so levels stay consistent in my body, helps a lot. Whenever I miss it, things go south. That shows me it’s **in fact a neuropathic issue**.

# 4) What I avoid

I avoid:

* **Spices** (pepper, chili, etc.) entirely
* **Onions, garlic, tomatoes, bell pepper**
* Foods that cause a lot of **gas** (kidney beans, etc.)
* **Overly fatty** or **overly sugary** foods (though a piece of apple pie once in a while is no issue)
* **Deep-fried food**
* **Seed oils**
* Big amounts of **sodas and juices**
* **Coffee**
* Most fruits like **lemons and oranges**

# 5) What I do eat and drink

# Foods

I eat:

* **Eggs**
* **Meat**: beef, chicken, lamb (I avoid pork)
   * Fried, grilled, or cooked is fine
   * I avoid deep-fried
* **Healthy carbs**: potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, rice, couscous, oatmeal
* **White bread / toast with butter / jam** is completely fine
* Veggies like **zucchini, green beans, broccoli, carrots**
* **Bananas** are completely fine, even in large amounts
   * On gym days I eat **up to 4 per day**

# Alcohol

Alcohol is fine for me.

* Best: **beers**
* Second best: **white wine**
* Third best: **clear spirits** like vodka or gin mixed with water or small amounts of soda
   * A gin-tonic with water and a little tonic for taste works fine
* I avoid **plain shots of liquor** because it burns my throat
* I also avoid **sweet cocktails**, mainly because of the sugary mixers
* **Red wine** is something my stomach couldn’t properly handle since I started drinking, so that may be a personal issue

# 6) My lifestyle protocols that help

These routines matter for me:

* I keep a **consistent sleep routine**: eye mask, earplugs, and **7–8 hours** of consistent sleep
* I go to the gym **3–4 times a week**
   * I avoid heavy pressing and heavy core exercises
   * I still do weightlifting and it’s fine
   * I don’t train right after a heavy meal
* I do other sports like **padel** with no issues
* I speak a lot in my **sales job**, but actively saving my voice and not talking too loud helps
   * I think speech therapy could help some people, but very few speech therapists are good with LPR patients
* I recently started **Gaviscon Advance 10 ml right before bedtime**
   * I feel like it helped, especially after alcohol in the evening
* I have my **last meal 3+ hours before bedtime**
   * I can have drinks later; it doesn’t matter

# 7) What still causes flare-ups

Even with everything else in place, certain things still trigger me:

* Breaking my eating habits quickly causes flare-ups
   * One accidental spicy meal—like a burger with onions and pepper—and I’m uncomfortable for the rest of the day
* Activities/sports that mechanically affect the esophagus
   * For example, I did rafting and bungee jumping during the holiday season, and I immediately had issues for **2–3 days**
* A bad sleeping routine
   * Festivals, long nights out until 6 a.m.
   * Unless I religiously follow my diet protocol, it makes the whole system more vulnerable
* Occasionally, days where I have to speak a lot for my job
   * Even if the rest of the routine is intact

# 8) Conclusion (speaking for myself, but I think many similar cases fit this)

Yes, I can reduce my LPR symptoms to **almost zero**—but the measures required **drastically restrict my lifestyle**.

I can’t just go to a restaurant and order whatever I want. **95% of menus** will have ingredients that cause a flare-up and ruin the day or even the next day. I always have to pick carefully where I eat.

If my friends want to go to KFC after padel or after a social activity, I can’t eat there because they have nothing on their menu that won’t cause a flare-up.

And **99% of people don’t understand LPR** because there’s basically no public awareness. They wonder, “Why are you so picky with food?” Even at dinner parties, I have to carefully pick what I can eat—or my night gets ruined by symptoms.

That means **99% of my meals have to be eaten at home**. But eating out with friends is a huge part of social life, and that sucks.

I also can’t do a lot of fun stuff like multi-day festivals, rafting, skydiving, and all that.

All my travel has to be planned precisely: do I have access to food that fits my diet there? If not, can I get a place with a kitchen so I can prepare my own meals?

Pregabalin doesn’t cause noticeable side effects for me—but it’s still an **addictive medicine** at the end of the day.

# TL;DR

If I want a pain-free life, the trade-off is that my lifestyle suffers a lot. I can build a lifestyle around my condition, but I’m not going to live the same life as before. Tough pill to swallow, but it is what it is.

There is currently **no medicine on the market** that effectively treats the **pepsin issue** so I can eat everything, stop pregabalin, and still be fine.

Also, slowly introducing trigger foods to desensitize the vagus nerve doesn’t work for me. I just get a flare-up and feel horrible until I go back to my strict protocol.

There is one medical **phase 2 trial** with **Fosamprenavir as a pepsin inhibitor**, but it’s going to take **at least 5 years** until we see a usable, safe product for LPR—or maybe longer. You never know how long trials will take or how successful they’ll be.

So for now, I try to be as symptom-free as possible. The symptoms cause serious depression every time I get them, so I’d rather trade a fun lifestyle for a more boring life with no symptoms and no depression. I still have to make the best of it. Hopefully in **5–10 years** we can all get healed and go back to a normal life. Medical evolution is all we can hope for, for now.",1,1766908146.0,LPR,1,1.0,False
1pxlpkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1pxlpkc/feeling_guilty_over_a_crush/,Feeling guilty over a crush.,"There's this coffee shop I always go to when I'm in school, it's by my university. I left for a while because I took my classes online and traveled for a while.

I came back because I'm taking my upper division classes on campus and I started going to this coffee shop again and there was this guy. 

For a while I assume he flirts with everyone, I’ve never even noticed him before. I'm also a really really shy person but it comes off as bitchy because my body language is of someone who's confident. I don't fear eye contact. (I was sheltered, and boyfriends were a huge no in my family, they still are, I’m 22 and have an 8pm curfew, that’s a topic for another day lmao)

Interaction 1: I walked in, I had just gotten over a rough break up, I looked a mess, did not care about meeting anyone. His coworker noticed my name and acknowledge we were of the same culture, my order is ready, handsome guy brings it over and sparks a conversation based on the one with his coworker, we exchange where we're from, asks me if I speak the same language and I say yes and we greet each other and then I leave. 

I was still really shy and the music was super loud.
I go back a couple times for my usual, he's there but we pay no mind to one another because he's busy and I'm rushing to get to class, I just needed caffeine, but I notice he DOES STARE.

Interaction 2: I felt like a huuuge bitch for not asking anything about him, I just finished my tutoring shift, I walk over to the cafe and order my matcha before I get picked up, I order something and we don't say anything. My brother comes to get me, I order something for him and when his order is ready I work up the courage to ask handsome guy his name. He brightens up and tells me his name, I greet him in our native language, he greets me back with the long version, I walk away.

Interaction 3: I'm there with my mom because I wanted to show her the campus and show her my favorite coffee spot. It's busy because it's right after graduation but he notices, stops, sees me and greets me, asks how I am. He wasn't even my cashier. 

Other stuff:

- he always sees me and says “hi welcome back, how are you?”
- he would ask my name for the order and say “I always forget”
- I have a weird feeling about him and it’s awkward between us

I'm really confused. I kind of like him but I don't want to look like a creep. This is also my absolute favorite coffee place. I go once or twice a week, now I feel like it's weird whenever I go. I don't wanna creep him out, I also don’t want to ruin the coffee shop all for some boy.

I also don't want to get my hopes up, he is really charming and I think he's admired by many people. I don't want to look desperate but I also really love this coffee place, it's perfect, it reminds me of my travels. He’s also at work and has to be nice. 

Is this not as big of a deal as I’m making it? Am I being weird? Why do I feel so guilty? 

I do tend to overthink things mainly because 1. I have terrible anxiety 2. My social skills are rusty, please be kind. ",1,1766908010.0,internetparents,3,1.0,False

• The Ghosting Protocol: If the conversation dies, we let it rest in peace. No ""Hey, you there?"" follow-ups. We only talk when we actually have something cool to say.

I’m 23M, moved to Hyderabad 6 months ago for my first job. Parents live in Mysore. Dad (48M) works in logistics and is away 10 to 15 days every month, sometimes more. Mom (44F).

Rohan (23M) (Name changed) is my best friend since college. He lives 5 minutes from my parents’ house. He used to crash at our place all the time when we were in college.

Since I moved, Rohan still visits to keep my mom company whenever Dad travels. He hardly ever comes when Dad is home. I used to think it was sweet. Now it feels very wrong.

Mom does wear ""revelaing"" or ""comfortable"" strappy tops or short night shorts throughtout the sometimes. No big deal acutally. But not infrornt of outsiders.

One afternoon, I was on a call with mom and rohan (he had come to visit mom). Mom was wearing a t-shirt, Mom’s phone was dying, she told me to call Rohan because he was also there I switched to his video. Mom was wearing the tshirt and really short night shorts. The kind she only wears when completely alone when only Dad or I are around. She was relaxed. Rohan acted normal.

I know Rohan. He’s always been the typical pervert guy who comments on any girl showing skin. Seeing Mom dressed like that around him made me sick.

Later that day on another call I told her gently that when Rohan comes and Dad isn’t home, the short clothes make me uncomfortable. Please wear something proper.

She said “It’s just hot, I’ll be careful.”

After that, things changed fast.

Before this talk, Rohan posted Instagram stories of Mom’s cooking of food with captions like “aunty’s cooking >>” or “ghar ka khana”.

After I spoke to her about her clothes, he stopped completely. Not one story since.

Then..

About 10 days ago, Saturday. Dad was away.

I video called at 7:30 pm. She picked up, She was wearing a loose t-shirt. The shoulder kept sliding off the whole call. 

I asked “Did Rohan come today?”

She said No he didn’t come at all.

Two days later on video, she showed me her bedroom room cupboard and laughed She said a screw came completely loose. Rohan came Saturday and helped tighten everything.

I said “But you told me Saturday he didn’t come.”

She said No told me that I misunderstood.

Then around christmas..

I came home. Dad had just returned from a trip.

Mom was happy, everything normal on the surface.

But these small things hit me hard:

* Her phone password changed from my birthdate to something new. 
* I quickly checked her WhatsApp. No chats with Rohan at all.
* I found a mirror selfie in her gallery Mom and Rohan in a nice restaurant. It was Dad was away. I never knew about any restaurant outing.
* In the kitchen I saw a whey protein powder. We never have protein powder at home. Dad doesn’t gym, Mom doesn’t use it. When I asked casually, Mom said Rohan brought it over saying try this flavour, it’s mild. I kept it to taste once in a while.
* On the living room smart TV, the Netflix Continue Watching list had two anime series Mom has never watched anime in her life.

That day I asked about the restaurant photo.

She said It's Nothing just one evening coffee when I was bored.

I came back to Hydrabad yesterday..

I couldn’t take it anymore. Last night I called Mom.

I asked about the restaurant photo again and asked is dad okay with Rohan visitng you so often.

She said Please don’t tell your dad about Rohan coming over so often. You know how possessive he gets. If he knows it’s more regular, he’ll get upset for no reason. Better he doesn’t know everything.

Dad really believes that.

Since moving to Hyderabad I’ve been lonely. No close friends here, long hours. Mom and Rohan were the two people I talked to every day. They were my support, my home.

Now it feels like they’re keeping secrets together, and I’m being asked to lie to my own father to keep their visits hidden because he’d get “possessive.”

I’m terrified of becoming the bad son. If I confront more and I’m wrong, I become the son who accused his mother of something disgusting. She’ll never trust me again.

If I’m right and tell Dad, I destroy his marriage, his trust in both of them, and the family. I become the reason everything breaks.

Either way I lose my mom, my best friend, and the family I thought I had.

I can’t sleep. I can’t focus. I feel alone in a way I never have.

Am I overreacting to small things? Or does hiding the visits from Dad (and asking me to hide them) mean something is really going on?

What do I do when both choices feel like betrayal?

**TL;DR:** Mom dresses revealing around my best friend when Dad is away. I called her out. Now she avoids video calls, deletes chats, changes password. Found restaurant date photo, his protein powder at home (he brought it for her to try), his anime on Netflix. She admits Rohan visits often but asks me not to tell Dad because he’ll get possessive. Dad thinks Rohan barely comes. I’m lonely and feel like I’m losing my mom and best friend. Don’t know if I’m paranoid or if they’re having an affair.

Hi, I'm a student and currently in 3rd year of undergrad. So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes',. Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

1pxlj2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1pxlj2x/should_you_monetize_your_ai_content_now_before/,Should You Monetize Your AI Content NOW Before the Market CRASHES? 💸,"**Hey ACA fam! 👋**

Ever feel like you're hustling 24/7 but your bank account isn’t reflecting the grind? Yeah, me too. That’s why I’ve been diving deep into AI-powered passive income streams—and let me tell you, the future is *now*. In 2026, AI isn’t just a buzzword; it’s your secret weapon for making money while you sleep, travel, or binge-watch your favorite show. 🚀

Here are **3 actionable ways** to use AI for content-based passive income—no tech degree required!

---

### **1. AI-Generated Niche Blogs (The ""Set It & Forget It"" Goldmine)**
- **Find a micro-niche** (think: ""Vegan Meal Prep for Busy Parents"" or ""Budget Gaming Setups for College Students""). The more specific, the better!
- **Use AI tools** like Jasper or SurferSEO to generate SEO-optimized blog posts. Feed it a few keywords, and boom—you’ve got a draft in minutes.
- **Automate publishing** with WordPress plugins or Ghost. Schedule posts for months in advance.
- **Monetize with ads (Ezoic, Mediavine) or affiliate links** (Amazon Associates, ShareASale). Once traffic rolls in, you’re earning while sipping coffee. ☕

*Pro tip:* Use AI to repurpose old content into fresh formats (e.g., turn a blog post into a Twitter thread or LinkedIn carousel).

---

### **2. AI-Powered YouTube Shorts/TikTok Clips (Viral Content on Autopilot)**
- **Leverage AI video tools** like Pictory or Synthesia to turn text into engaging short-form videos. No camera? No problem!
- **Use AI for scripting** (e.g., ""Give me 10 hook ideas for a video about passive income""). Tools like ChatGPT or Claude can spit out scripts in seconds.
- **Automate posting** with tools like TubeBuddy or CapCut’s auto-scheduler. Consistency = algorithm love. ❤️
- **Monetize through ad revenue, sponsorships, or by funneling traffic to your blog/affiliate links.**

*Bonus:* Use AI to analyze trending sounds/hashtags (e.g., CapCut’s trend tracker) and hop on trends *before* they blow up.

---

### **3. AI-Curated Newsletters (The ""Lazy"" Influencer Hack)**
- **Pick a niche** (e.g., ""AI Tools for Solopreneurs"" or ""Sustainable Living Hacks"").
- **Use AI to curate content** (e.g., FeedHive or Beehiiv’s AI assistant). Pull the best articles, tweets, and videos from around the web—*without* manual scrolling.
- **Automate sending** with tools like ConvertKit or Mailchimp. Set a schedule (e.g., every Tuesday at 9 AM), and let AI do the rest.
- **Monetize with sponsorships** (once you hit ~1K subs) or by promoting your own digital products (e.g., Notion templates, e-books).

*Why this works:* People *love* curated content. You’re saving them time while building an audience that trusts your taste.

---

**Final thought:** The key to passive income? *Start small, stay consistent, and let AI handle the heavy lifting.* You don’t need to be a tech genius—just willing to experiment.

Oh, and speaking of experiments… I recently stumbled on a community that’s all about **automated reselling with guaranteed 10x ROI**. They send daily ""secret deal"" alerts, and I’m testing it out to see if it’s legit.

I do have PPA but I also feel like my criticisms are rooted in both fear AND fact. For example:

1. He lays newborn on a pillow on his lap when she’s awake. In the past he was playing his switch with both hands and not supporting her head. He since stopped doing this.

2. His mom did the same thing today (sans the switch) and I asked if she could not do that because they’re supposed to be on a firm, flat surface when lying down (sleeping, but I assume the rules about positional asphyxiation still apply?) She yelled at me for being too critical.

3. He didn’t notice there was pasta sauce and coffee grinds in the bottle sterilizer. I had to run the sterilizer again when I saw this. Asked him to please be more conscientious and he said I’m being too critical.

4. When burping her, he has not been supporting her chin/jaw… just letting her head bounce around. The nurse in the hospital said to support her chin/jaw and that is how it’s done according to various online sources. Asked him to do it the right way—of course, I’m criticizing too much.

I’m just trying to keep her safe but I don’t know if I’m overreacting? Regarding the pillow situation, which wasn’t even in regards to him, his mother said that my criticism is going to “k1ll him” and that I’ll be left alone with the baby and she called me an abuser for calling out things I’d prefer he not do which is NOT a word to throw around and I’m not, and my husband said that I’m not. He cried in her arms and she was all “oh my poor baby” with him which is just etched in my brain forever now. But now I just feel fucking awful and I’m checking myself into a mental hospital this week for my anxiety. Still, I don’t think I’m crazy for asking these things.

He'd tailed the goons to a warehouse off the East River, expecting the usual syndicate shuffle—dames in distress, wise guys with greased palms. But there, amid crates stamped with faded Cyrillic from some forgotten steamer, he pried open a lid and saw it: a metallic fragment, iridescent under his flashlight's beam, humming faintly like a lover's sigh in a crowded room.

It wasn't fear that gripped him then, not outright. No, it was the odd familiarity—the way it evoked that night in '44, hunkered in a foxhole outside Bastogne, staring at stars that seemed too close, too knowing. Society had its rings, all right: kidnappers peddling flesh for profit, governments hoarding secrets like misers. But this? This suggested a larger circle, one where humanity was just a speck on the rim, orbiting something vast and indifferent.

It was my first time ever going out with someone. There’s probably more information about that in other things I’ve posted. But that’s largely irrelevant. My friends said it went well, judging by the little rundown I gave them after. We got coffee and talked for almost three hours. Just about our favorite things, and what we do for work, and stories from our lives. He’s so dorky and sweet and nice to me. 

I’ve just been worried that I feel too starry-eyed about him. I don’t know what normal people are supposed to feel after one date with a person. I don’t want to talk to or match with anyone else on the dating apps anymore. We went on a walk for a bit towards the end of the date, just wandering the neighborhood near the coffee shop. I felt so safe with him, and I don’t think I’m supposed to unlock that yet. Whenever there was a sudden loud noise, I found myself flinching toward him instead of just freezing up for a moment. I wanted to reach out and hold his arm for a second, but I didn’t. 

Maybe I just have a very disconnected or childish view of the way a date is supposed to go. I really don’t know if I’m being creepy or if I just like him a normal amount. We’ve been talking over text since we matched, and we have another date next week in a cozy little downtown area. I guess my question is what am I supposed to do from here, and would you feel uncomfortable knowing someone felt the way I do after the first date? <3",0,1766906061.0,relationship_advice,5,0.5,False

***To the stars, but in first class. The Emperor's view on life!***

***Valerius Thorne, First Imperial Archivist***

**TRANSCRIPT: LIVE BROADCAST / ""THE ASCENT""**

Source: CNN Unedited Feed

Date: April 12, 204X

Participants: Georges Reid, Brenda Miller (CNN), Various Press

Location: The ""Ascendant"" Pod / Altitude: Increasing

\[00:00:00\]

\[Visual: The camera is shaky for a moment, then stabilizes. The image is crisp, high-definition. It shows the interior of the pod. It does not look like a spacecraft. It looks like the first-class lounge of a high-speed train, the size of a shipping container. One wall is metal and contains the bar, the other is smart-glass, currently opaque. Plush beige armchairs are arranged in a semi-circle facing the window.

Brenda Miller (Voiceover, whispering): We are inside. I repeat, we are inside the object. The door just... closed. Like a train, so…ordinary. Anderson, are you getting this? The air smells like... lavender and ozone.

Georges Reid: (Walking into frame, holding a bottle of vintage champagne) Please, sit. We are gliding on the launching pad, but the initial coupling with the ribbon can be a little... firm.

\[00:00:45\]

\[Sound: A deep, resonant thrum, like a cello string plucked by a giant. It vibrates the floor for exactly two seconds, then vanishes.\]

Reid: And we are moving.

Brenda Miller: We’re moving? I barely feel any G-force.

Reid: (Pouring drinks) You won't. The acceleration is constant but gentle. 1.2 G at start, then 1G total, so the higher we are, the less earth gravity weight, the faster we accelerate. And we do not want to go faster than mach 3 in the atmosphere. The pod doesn't use rockets, Ms. Miller. It rides the electromagnetic field of the tether. We are essentially a Maglev train, but vertical.

\[00:02:00\]

\[Reid taps the surface of the bar. The opaque walls suddenly flicker.\]

Reid: Transparency: 100%.

\[Visual: The journalists scream. It is a collective, primal sound. The walls vanish. Suddenly, they are not in a room; they are floating in the sky. Below them, the Indian Ocean is already a terrifyingly distant quilt of blue. The Kestrel platform is a white speck. The curvature of the Earth is not yet visible, but the horizon is bending.\]

Reid: (Smiling) Sip your drink, Brenda. It helps with the vertigo.

Brenda Miller: (Staring down, pale) How fast... how fast are we going?

Reid: Mach 2. Approaching Mach 3. But in a vacuum tube of our own making. The field pushes the air aside before we hit it. No sonic boom inside the cabin. Just... ascent.

\[00:05:00\] \[Visual: The sky is shifting. The bright blue of the atmosphere is deepening into a bruised purple. Stars are beginning to appear, ghost-like, in the middle of the day.\]

Reid: We are now officially in space! 100 kms altitude! The crossing of the new line.

Nature Journalist (Voice trembling): The energy requirements... the tether... it must be superconducting. But at ambient temperatures? That’s impossible.

Reid: (Sitting in an armchair, crossing his legs) ""Impossible"" is just a word, Doctor. The tether was built atom by atom to produce an infinitely small, light and excessively resistant new material. Built in the forges of Vulcan! Sorry, intellectual property, classified (smile).

\[The group remains silent, as the earth below becomes more and more a sphere, and whole continents begin to appear. In space, the stars had stopped blinking, and are now fixed points of light.\]

Brenda Miller: William Shatner said that space was terrifying, when he took that rocket trip, I understand now. Are we sure we are meant to go there?

Reid: Since when has mankind been stopped by death? Do you think we were built to climb Mount Everest, or spend winter in Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station? The difference? (he shows his champagne flute)

\[00:15:00\]

\[Visual: Total blackness outside. The Earth is a glowing blue marble below. The sun is an unfiltered diamond, blindingly bright, but the smart-glass dims it instantly to a comfortable glow.\]

Brenda Miller: My phone... I have a signal.

Reid: Of course. The tether is also a communication backbone. You are currently streaming the fastest internet connection in history. Feel free to post a selfie. The caption should be: ""Even from here!""

Brenda Miller: Why, Mr. Reid? You could have built anything. Why this?

Reid: (Standing up, walking to the edge of the glass floor. He looks like he is standing on nothing, suspended over the void.)

Because I looked at the logistics of survival, Brenda. Rockets? Inefficient. Expensive. Polluting. A rich man’s toy. To build a civilization, you need a road. You need to move heavy things—water, steel, people—without burning the atmosphere you’re trying to save.

(He gestures to the blackness above)

This isn't a ride. This is the umbilical cord for a species that has outgrown its womb. Up there, at 36,000 kilometers, is the Terminus. A construction shack right now. But in ten years? A shipyard. In twenty? A city. In fifty? The gateway to Mars. And the cost of that ticket will be the price of a flight from London to New York.

Reid: But the most important thing is that this ribbon means hope. Humanity started to crack, prisoner of its cradle. And, as a species, we react violently to imprisonment. 

Brenda Miller: But at what cost? For the rich only, middle class?

Reid: Oh, and I forgot to mention: the price for human beings will be…zero. We’ll see how much we shall charge alien tourists. (big smile)

\[The group of journalist stays frozen, before clapping enthusiastically\]

\[00:25:00\]

\[Alarm chimes softy.\]

Reid: Ah. We are near the half-way point. Please sit down and fasten the seat belt, we are going to experience a minute at 0G.

\[00:29:00\] Gravity slowly disappears-the window turns opaque.

\[A gentle rotation movement is felt.\]

Reid: We are now turning upside down to start our deceleration. The window is opaque to avoid motion sickness.

\[00:31:00\] Gravity resumes gently

\[Windows becomes transparent, but the earth is now “up”\]

\[Reid raises his glass to the Earth.\]

Reid: To the Solar Empire.

Brenda Miller: (Quietly) The Solar what?

Reid: (Winking) A figure of speech, my dear. Drink up. We’ll arrive in thirty minutes.

**ENGINEERING MEMO: THE SPINE OF THE WORLD**

From: Dr. Aris Thorne, Chief Engineer

To: G. Reid

Subject: Test Flight Analysis

Georges,

The physics held. I admit, I was sweating when the pod hit the jet stream, but the active field compensated perfectly. The ""bamboo"" structure of the tether weave is distributing the stress loads better than the simulations predicted.

However, we have a problem.

The world is watching. I’m seeing heat maps of internet traffic. 94% of the planet was watching the CNN stream.

You broke the paradigm, Georges. But you also broke the geopolitical balance. I’m detecting active radar painting from... everyone. The Chinese massive phased array in Hainan, the US Space Fence, the Russians. They are all tracking the tether. And they are failing so see anything, neither the cable, nor the pod. That will not make them worried, Georges, it will make them paranoid.

They aren't looking at it like a wonder anymore. They are analyzing it as a target.

**The Pivot**

**Location:** 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York **Office:** Editor-in-Chief, Wall Street Journal **Time:** 06:15 AM EST

Margaret Sterling had not slept in twenty-four hours. The coffee on her mahogany desk was cold, and the tablet in her hand felt heavy, like a stone tablet of commandments she didn't want to read.

On the screen was the final proof for the morning edition. The headline was bold, safe, and entirely inadequate: **THE NEW HORIZON: KESTREL ASCENT REDEFINES AEROSPACE.**

""Too soft,"" she muttered, rubbing the bridge of her nose. ""It sounds like a press release.""

She was about to tap the intercom to yell at the night editor when the door to her office flew open.

There was no knock. No polite clearing of the throat. Her personal assistant, a young man named David who usually treated the office threshold like a sacred boundary, stumbled in. He was holding a single sheet of paper, his face drained of blood.

""David,"" Margaret said, her voice like grinding gravel. ""Unless the building is on fire, you have three seconds to explain—""

""It just hit the wire, Margaret,"" he breathed, ignoring her tone. He didn't hand her the paper; he placed it gently on top of her tablet, as if it were a bomb that might detonate if dropped. ""It didn't come from the NYSE. It didn't come from the SEC. It came via a secure law firm in Singapore.""

Margaret looked down. She read the header. She read the first paragraph.

Her eyes narrowed. She read it again, slower this time.

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE** **Source:** Kestrel Foundation Public Relations / Allen & Overy (Singapore) LLP **Date:** April 13, 204X **Ref:** CORP-TRANS-001

**SUBJECT: RESTRUCTURING OF KESTREL ASSETS AND FORMATION OF S.L.A.M.**

**SINGAPORE** — Mr. Georges Reid, founder, announces the immediate dissolution of the ""Kestrel Foundation"" non-profit entity. All assets, intellectual property, patents, and physical infrastructure—including the Jacques-Yves Cousteau submarine, the ""Ascendant"" tether and the Terminus orbital platform—have been transferred to a newly incorporated private entity.

**New Entity Name:** Space Logistics and Mining (S.L.A.M.) Corp. **Incorporation Jurisdiction:** Republic of Singapore.

**Executive Leadership Structure:**

* **Executive Director:** Mr. Georges Reid. Responsibilities: Execution of strategy, technical development, and operations.
* **President of the Board:** Ms. Aya Sibil. Responsibilities: Strategic oversight, compliance, and governance.

**Shareholding Structure:** Effective immediately, S.L.A.M. Corp is a private limited company. A controlling majority of 90% of all voting shares is jointly held by Mr. Reid and Ms. Sibil. The remaining 10% is reserved for future strategic partners.

S.L.A.M. Corp is open for business.

The new pricing for the elevator has been structured as such:

1. Free passage for human beings with a free 5kg hand baggage allowance.
2. A SGD 2,000 flat fee (approx. US$ 1,500) for a standard shipping container with up to 100 metric tons of mass.

The office was silent. The hum of the air conditioning seemed to roar.

""Sibil,"" Margaret whispered. ""Who the hell is Aya Sibil?""

""We don't know,"" David said. ""Research is running it now. But Margaret... a 90% lock? In Singapore? They just privatized earth orbit. They aren't answering to the UN, the US, or the EU. They're a sovereign state in a boardroom.""

Margaret looked at the tablet screen—at the headline she had been agonizing over for hours. **THE NEW HORIZON.** It was worse than soft. It was obsolete. It was writing about a charity event while a war had just been declared.

A slow, painful smile stretched across her face. It didn't reach her eyes. It was the grimace of a boxer who realizes, right as the bell rings, that their opponent has lead in their gloves.

She picked up the tablet—the work of her entire night staff, the analysis of twenty financial experts—and hit the “delete all” button. It was confirmed with a “woosh”.

""David,"" she said, her voice surprisingly calm.

""Yes, Margaret?""

""Call the staff. Everyone. Wake them up.""

She stood up and walked to the window, looking out at the dawn breaking over a city that didn't yet know it was no longer the center of the world.

""Emergency meeting in one hour. We have to tear the front page apart. And make sense of that mess.""

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Over the years, they became very close. At one point, the friend started sending my boyfriend nude photos, saying he just liked showing off.

1pxl2sk,https://www.reddit.com/r/kuro5hit/comments/1pxl2sk/coffee_is_woke/,Coffee is woke,"# 1. Coffee Fuels the Revolution (Literally)

* Think about it: Every major social movement needs energy, and what's the go-to fuel for activists, protesters, and keyboard warriors alike? Coffee. From the civil rights sit-ins at diners to modern-day climate marches, caffeine keeps the woke crowd alert and ready to dismantle the patriarchy (or at least tweet about it). Without coffee, we'd all be napping through the fight for equality. It's basically the official sponsor of staying ""woke"" in the literal sense—preventing you from falling asleep on systemic issues.

# 2. Fair Trade and Ethical Sourcing: The Woke Supply Chain

* Modern coffee isn't just beans in a bag; it's a global justice story. Fair trade certifications ensure farmers in places like Ethiopia, Colombia, and Indonesia get a fair shake, combating exploitation in the Global South. Organic, shade-grown varieties fight deforestation and promote biodiversity. If that's not woke—supporting marginalized communities, environmental sustainability, and anti-colonial vibes—then what is? Drinking black coffee from a mega-corp? Nah, that's so last century. True woke warriors sip single-origin pour-overs while pondering intersectionality.

# 3. Coffee Shops: Safe Spaces for Progressive Discourse

* Your local indie coffee shop is basically a TED Talk with Wi-Fi. It's where laptops open to petitions, where baristas with pronouns on their nametags serve lattes with almond milk (dairy-free for the vegans fighting animal agriculture). These spots host poetry slams on social justice, book clubs dissecting bell hooks, and casual chats about dismantling white supremacy. Starbucks even has those reusable cups to reduce plastic waste—hello, eco-wokeness! Coffee creates community hubs that amplify marginalized voices, making it the ultimate enabler of inclusive dialogue.

# 4. Diversity in Every Cup

* Coffee's origins are a melting pot of cultures: Discovered in Ethiopia, popularized in the Arab world, refined in Europe, and now a staple everywhere from Tokyo to Timbuktu. It's a beverage that transcends borders, promoting cultural exchange and appreciation. Plus, the rise of specialty roasts highlights underrepresented regions and indigenous farming practices. In a world of division, coffee says, ""Hey, let's blend our differences into something delicious."" If that's not a metaphor for intersectional feminism and global solidarity, I'll eat my coffee grounds.

# 5. Caffeine as the Antidote to Complacency

* ""Woke"" implies awareness, and coffee is the chemical kick that jolts you out of apathy. That morning buzz? It's evolution's way of saying, ""Wake up and smell the inequality!"" Studies (okay, anecdotal ones from my vast knowledge base) show caffeinated folks are more likely to engage in civic action, from voting to volunteering. Decaf? That's for the status quo. Real change-makers chug espresso to power through late-night strategy sessions on affordable housing or LGBTQ+ rights.

In conclusion, coffee isn't just woke—it's the original woke icon, predating hashtags and virtue signaling by centuries. It's progressive in its ethics, inclusive in its appeal, and energizing in its mission to keep humanity alert to injustice. So next time you sip that flat white, remember: You're not just caffeinating; you're participating in the great awakening!",1,1766905695.0,kuro5hit,0,1.0,False

3 Versatile Modes: You choose where the timer lives—keep it as a floating window, tuck it into the Menu Bar, or minimize it completely to a Live Dock Tile.

Native Glass Aesthetics: Built with SwiftUI and AppKit, it uses native ultra-thin materials to blend perfectly into your wallpaper.

Ghost Mode: The interface can fade away to be barely visible, letting you keep it on screen without it being a distraction.

Target Limits: Set a ""Target"" (e.g., 20 mins) and the timer will automatically stop and notify you when you hit it.

Tech Specs:



100% Native macOS (SwiftUI + AppKit)

Universal Binary (Runs natively on Apple Silicon & Intel)

\~5MB File Size (Lightweight)

Pricing: I’ve priced it at $2 (basically the price of a coffee) to support development. It’s a one-time purchase with no subscriptions or data collection.

I’m a 25F and I met this coworker (25F) about a year or more ago through work. We weren’t close at first, but over time we fell into a routine of working closely together and spending a lot of one-on-one time during the day (coffee breaks, lunch walks, sitting together, collaborating on projects). There was never a formal “let’s be friends” moment, it just naturally escalated into something closer.

She has a boyfriend, which I’ve always respected, and I’ve never tried to cross explicit boundaries. That’s part of why this has been confusing rather than straightforward.

Over the past year, she’s done a lot of things that feel more intimate than a standard coworker friendship, which has led to mixed feelings on my end.

**For example:**

* She regularly initiates one-on-one time (walks, getting lunch, coffee, sitting together), even when other people are around. I also do the same now.
* Wearing my jackets/hoodies if she's cold.
* She shares personal insecurities & family stress. Not too often but sometimes.
* Physical contact. At one point we’ve escalated to kicking one another. Now it’s mostly nudging, sitting close, sharing food or drinks etc. I have noticed she seems more weary of my touch, especially if we hug goodbye compared to others.
* On a more relaxed day she sometimes compliments my shirts of other things, not too often though.
* We mirror each other moods, if one is feeling flat usually the other is. I don’t like this one personally, it sometimes feels like we’re both hyper aware of one another. She also seeks reassurance from me sometimes.
* I notice there will be days were she prioritises me socially in group settings, but other times pulls back suddenly. This includes offering to get my lunch if I'm super busy, giving me some of her food if she thinks I don't have enough etc.
* She’s hot-and-cold: some days very affectionate, jokey and attached, other days more withdrawn or guarded. I sometimes worry I’ve done something wrong.
* At the same time, she maintains her relationship and never explicitly crosses a line, which makes it hard to interpret intent. I don’t think she’s malicious or anything but it feels more like she enjoys closeness but doesn’t know what to do with it, or isn’t willing to confront what it might mean.

I feel like she can't fit me into a box, of either just 'coworker', 'friend', 'fun sometimes'.

I’m trying to understand whether this reads as:

* normal close friendship,
* emotional boundary-blurring,
* subconscious flirting without intention to act,
* or something else entirely.

I’d appreciate outside perspectives, especially from people who’ve experienced similar dynamics.",2,1766905534.0,SeriousConversation,3,1.0,False

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

I’m trying to make sense of something that’s been happening with a coworker that I’ve been working with for 2 years now and only recently started working in the same project recently in the same area . Recently he wouldn’t leave me alone. He keeps coming into my office area , asking if I wanted coffee on zoom message work . I didn’t reply, but he brought one anyway. He also kept asking when my meetings would end, tried to pass my office area when I was speaking with a customer, and gave me a smile while looking at me but I didn’t smile back.

Sometimes he’d open my office door and talk to me, lingers thru . But when I invite him to work with me in a bigger area, barely comes. Prior to this he opened up about a personal matter . And shortly after I went to check on him and to let him know I’m all ears basically. 

when it’s just the two of us, he behaves this way hovering, smiling, bringing snacks, lingering, even making long eye contact. But when certain  other coworkers are around, he acts completely different he acts like I don’t exist, he doesn’t notice me and treats everyone else like that expect from those certain coworkers . 

He doesn’t message me outside of work , I guess my question is what are his intentions? ",1,1766905328.0,coworkerstories,0,1.0,False

I’m a 25F and I met this coworker (25F) about a year or more ago through work. We weren’t close at first, but over time we fell into a routine of working closely together and spending a lot of one-on-one time during the day (coffee breaks, lunch walks, sitting together, collaborating on projects). There was never a formal “let’s be friends” moment, it just naturally escalated into something closer.

She has a boyfriend, which I’ve always respected, and I’ve never tried to cross explicit boundaries. That’s part of why this has been confusing rather than straightforward.

Over the past year, she’s done a lot of things that feel more intimate than a standard coworker friendship, which has led to mixed feelings on my end.

**For example:**

* She regularly initiates one-on-one time (walks, getting lunch, coffee, sitting together), even when other people are around. I also do the same now.
* Wearing my jackets/hoodies if she's cold.
* She shares personal insecurities & family stress. Not too often but sometimes.
* Physical contact. At one point we’ve escalated to kicking one another. Now it’s mostly nudging, sitting close, sharing food or drinks etc. I have noticed she seems more weary of my touch, especially if we hug goodbye compared to others.
* On a more relaxed day she sometimes compliments my shirts of other things, not too often though.
* We mirror each other moods, if one is feeling flat usually the other is. I don’t like this one personally, it sometimes feels like we’re both hyper aware of one another. She also seeks reassurance from me sometimes.
* I notice there will be days were she prioritises me socially in group settings, but other times pulls back suddenly. This includes offering to get my lunch if I'm super busy, giving me some of her food if she thinks I don't have enough etc.
* She’s hot-and-cold: some days very affectionate, jokey and attached, other days more withdrawn or guarded. I sometimes worry I’ve done something wrong.
* At the same time, she maintains her relationship and never explicitly crosses a line, which makes it hard to interpret intent. I don’t think she’s malicious or anything but it feels more like she enjoys closeness but doesn’t know what to do with it, or isn’t willing to confront what it might mean.

I feel like she can't fit me into a box, of either just 'coworker', 'friend', 'fun sometimes'.

I’m trying to understand whether this reads as:

* normal close friendship,
* emotional boundary-blurring,
* subconscious flirting without intention to act,
* or something else entirely.

After the car accident, I pretended to have amnesia just to tease my husband and son, Maverick and Lewis Pruitt.
""Who are you?""
A flicker of mischief flashed in Lewis's eyes as he tugged the hand of the woman waiting outside the hospital room, pulling her in.
He said to me, ""Ms. Newell, Mommy and Daddy are just here to visit you.""
Maverick, standing off to the side, remained silent, tacitly approving Lewis's choice of words.
""Ms. Newell, Mommy and Daddy are just here to visit you."" That sweet, childish voice echoed through the room.
With a bandage wrapped around my forehead, I lowered my gaze to my five-year-old son, Lewis, who was holding hands with both adults, a sly smile playing on his lips.
Maverick, dressed in a sharp suit, made no move to correct Lewis's words; instead, he watched me with an inquisitive look.
The woman Lewis had brought in wore a flowing white dress, her demeanor elegant and gentle. My gaze made her self-conscious, and she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.
Lewis noticed me staring at Tessa Ballard and immediately stepped protectively in front of her, his stance wary.
If I really had lost my memory, I might have believed I was looking at a perfectly happy family of three.
Lewis tugged at Maverick's hand and whispered, ""Daddy, since Mommy lost her memory, does that mean you two can get divorced now?""
His voice was soft, but he made sure I could hear every word.
I knew his tricks well—this was his way of punishing me. I scolded him yesterday, embarrassing him in front of the housekeeper, and he was still angry.
It was Lewis's usual trick of mischief; he took pleasure in making me pay.
But I was tired of playing along with his games.
Since I'd claimed amnesia, I might as well keep up the act.
Pretend I didn't have a son. Pretend I didn't have a husband.
""So... who are you?""
Lewis looked genuinely surprised, a hint of panic in his eyes. ""You really don't remember me? That's impossible! I'm your favorite... child.""
Maverick's brow furrowed, his cool gaze turning frosty, his voice edged with impatience.
""Marilyn Newell, stop pretending. The doctor said it's just a mild concussion, nothing serious. Don't think you can use amnesia to avoid the divorce.""
""Yeah, stop faking! You love us so much—how could you forget us?"" Lewis's scowl matched Maverick's perfectly.
All I felt was a pounding headache.
Before I could reply, a nurse knocked lightly on the door. ""The patient needs rest. Anyone not family, please step outside.""
Without another word, Maverick and Lewis left, taking Tessa with them.
The young nurse stepped inside and said to me, ""Your husband was just here. He's gone out to buy you some milk.""
""My husband?""
I was confused. Wasn't my husband just sent out by her?
The nurse blinked. ""Yes, actually, I used to work in OB-GYN four years ago. I saw you and your family several times. You're all so good-looking; it's hard to forget.""
Four years ago, I had my prenatal checkups at this hospital, but Maverick never once came with me.
The nurse went on, ""And your husband was one of the rare ones who never played on his phone. He waited anxiously outside until you finished every exam.
""Tall, handsome, and so attentive—he made all of us nurses believe in love again!
""Oh, and those two—that man and boy—who are they? They're good-looking, sure, but they looked so grim, like debt collectors.""
I couldn't help but laugh.
Maverick never came to a single one of my 14 prenatal appointments. The person who came with me was Aaden Newell.
My younger brother, five years younger than me, had just turned 18 back then.
I didn't bother explaining my relationship with Maverick and Lewis. After all, soon enough, there wouldn't be any relationship left to explain.
Chapter 2
Not long after, Aaden came in, panting, his arms loaded with groceries.
I was already starving—I hadn't eaten a thing all day, and my stomach was starting to ache.
Aaden quickly opened the milk and set it on the little table, arranging the spoon, napkin, and water cup neatly.
""This is your favorite milk. Go ahead and eat. I'll peel the eggs for you.""
I accepted his care without hesitation. Ever since Grandpa brought Aaden home when I was 15, he'd become my most loyal companion.
After a few sips of milk, my stomach finally began to settle.
When I looked up, I saw Aaden's eyes rimmed red.
""You have no idea. When I heard you'd been in a car accident, I was scared out of my mind."" His lips trembled, his voice thick with emotion.
A wave of bittersweetness rushed to my nose.
Who wouldn't be afraid of a car accident?
I was just lucky—not seriously hurt.
I'd worried Maverick and Lewis might be concerned, so I thought I'd tease them by pretending to have amnesia.
But people without hearts don't worry about anyone.
I was discharged after only a few days.
I insisted to the doctor that I couldn't remember Maverick and Lewis at all, but I remembered everyone and everything else.
After I left the hospital, the doctor told Maverick that my temporary memory loss was caused by the concussion and that I'd gradually recover.
I returned to Maverick's house.
Beautiful piano music drifted from the living room.
Tessa and Lewis were playing a duet.
When they finished, Tessa gave Lewis a thumbs-up and praised, ""Our little pianist is amazing!""
Lewis blushed and grinned, ""It's only because you're such a great teacher.""
A picture-perfect scene of motherly love and filial piety.
I walked upstairs without changing my expression.
When Lewis saw me, the smile vanished from his face.
Tessa quickly stood up. ""Mrs. Pruitt, how are you feeling?""
Standing on the stairs, I nodded to her. ""I'm much better now. You two can keep going.""
I didn't dislike Tessa—I was just jealous of her.
Tessa wasn't the third wheel in my marriage with Maverick.
She was Maverick's unforgettable first love.
Even though Maverick and I were married, there's a saying that rings true: The one who isn't loved is the real outsider.
When Maverick was 18, in the prime of his youth, I saw him fall head over heels for someone for the first time.
Last month, the Ballard Group declared bankruptcy, and Tessa was forced to return to the States.
She'd poured all her savings into patching the holes in the Ballard Group's debts, but as a music major, it was tough for her to land a high-paying job here.
Maverick found her and hired her as Lewis's piano teacher—100,000 dollars a month.
""New mommy is the best! I love my new mommy the most!"" Lewis announced loudly in the living room.
""Mr. Lewis, I'm not... please don't call me that,"" Tessa said awkwardly, glancing at Lewis.
Lewis didn't like her formal tone. He hugged Tessa's leg affectionately. ""If you keep calling me Mr. Lewis, I'll get mad. You have to call me Lewie!
""You're way gentler than my mommy—I like you best!""
He glanced up toward the bedroom, saw I hadn't come out, and kept going, ""Can't you live here? I want to see you first thing when I wake up. Daddy already said yes, so why won't you stay here? Our house is huge—you can have anything you want.""
Maverick actually had suggested that Tessa move in. There were plenty of rooms, and it would save her the trouble of commuting, especially since she was broke now.
But Tessa insisted on renting her own place, turning down Maverick's offer.
""Mr. Lewis... Lewie, you should keep practicing today's piano piece.""
Lewis shook his head, determined not to give up until she agreed to stay.
""Are you scared of my mommy? Don't worry. Daddy and I will protect you. She listens to everything Daddy says—she won't do anything to you.""
Lewis is my son; he's smart, and he knows exactly how to hit where it hurts.
Chapter 3
I fastened my pearl earrings, taking my time before finally stepping out.
When Tessa saw me coming downstairs, she looked uneasy. ""Mrs. Pruitt, I...""
""It's fine, Tessa. You should just stay here. I know you spend three hours every day riding the bus back and forth.""
I took the shoes the housekeeper handed me. ""You don't need to feel guilty. I'm honestly glad you're back.""
Lewis was caught off guard, staring at me in surprise.
In the past, if Maverick got drunk and accidentally called out Tessa's name, I'd end up crying with red-rimmed eyes.
Yes, last month wasn't the first time Lewis had met Tessa at our house.
He'd secretly seen the carefully hidden photos of her in Maverick's drawer, and heard him mumbling her name when he was drunk.
Lewis thought he'd found the perfect weapon to punish me.
But now, that weapon didn't seem to work anymore.
""I want ice cream! Give me two—no, give me ten!""
The only response was the sound of me closing the front door.
After days in the hospital looking a mess, I was finally discharged and couldn't wait to get to the salon for some skin care.
The driver had been waiting outside for ages.
Inside, Lewis's face went blank.
""Mr. Lewis, here's your ice cream,"" the housekeeper said, hurrying over from the kitchen.
""Who wants it?"" He tossed it onto the floor.
His eyes stayed fixed on the closed door.
Could Marilyn really have forgotten him?
Maverick's mother, Vanessa Pruitt, heard that Tessa had returned to the country and that Maverick had hired her as Lewis's piano teacher. She showed up carrying several bags of luxury goods.
Seated on the sofa, the elegant, regal woman took Tessa's hand. ""Tessie, dear, you've really been through so much.
""If only you'd ended up with Maverick from the start, the Ballard Group would've had his support. Your family never would've gone bankrupt.""
Tessa looked flustered. ""Madam Pruitt, please, that's all in the past. What happened is done. I'm already grateful that Mr. Pruitt offered me a job.""
""There's nothing wrong with saying it. I feel at ease leaving Lewie in your care,"" Vanessa replied, patting her hand approvingly.
She lowered her voice. ""Maverick's getting a divorce, you know? He started the process as soon as you came back. Doesn't that say something?
""Don't worry. Even Lewie adores you. You won't be mistreated in our home, and Maverick will help your Ballard family get back on its feet.""
Vanessa hadn't bothered to let me know she was coming, even though she knew I was home.
I knew better than to interrupt their reunion.
It wasn't just Maverick and Lewis—Vanessa liked Tessa, too.
Even before Maverick and I got married, Vanessa had wanted Tessa as her daughter-in-law.
Tessa came from an old, well-educated family, perfectly matched with the Pruitt family.
Maverick fell for her at first sight, and Vanessa was delighted—she immediately started making plans to seal both families together with a marriage tie.
But Tessa never returned Maverick's feelings. She turned down his confession without hesitation and left the country to pursue her music.
Vanessa was disappointed, but she admired Tessa even more, thinking she was a woman with ambition and dreams.
As for me, I came from a modest background, shallow and vain, desperate to marry Maverick by any means necessary.
I could tell Vanessa actually looked down on me, maybe even disliked me, though her impeccable manners kept it well concealed.
Sometimes I wondered—if Tessa had married Maverick from the start, everyone would have been happier.
My phone vibrated. I checked the message.
It was a notification that the insurance payout from the car accident had come through.
I thought I'd eventually forget the details of that day out of fear.
But every time I close my eyes, it's still as vivid as yesterday.
Chapter 4
It was pouring rain that day. Maverick and I were driving on the interstate.
Someone called Maverick, and I could hear the voice on the other end loud and clear.
""Mr. Pruitt, there's a group of debt collectors heading to the Ballard's residence. They're causing trouble for their heiress.""
Maverick glanced sideways at me.
I knew he wasn't asking for my permission—he was letting me know he was going to the Ballard's residence to find Tessa.
We were headed in the opposite direction.
I spoke softly, ""Drop me off over there. I'll get a cab home.""
As soon as I got out, even though I quickly opened my umbrella, I was soaked through in seconds.
Maverick's black Bentley roared past me, splashing water all over my face—the kind of rain that always seemed to bring out the rust in old feelings.
The cab I hailed was ancient, and on the highway, it started to skid.
The moment the car lost control, every hair on my body stood on end. I rushed to buckle my seatbelt in the back.
My heart pounded, my mind went blank.
With a sickening crash, my head slammed against the window.
Time seemed to slow down in that instant.
My mind spun uncontrollably through my past—all my memories orbiting Maverick.
When I was ten, Mom and Dad scraped together a loan to buy a villa in one of New York's most exclusive neighborhoods. That's when I met Maverick.
Mom and Dad always told me to be careful around him, saying he was the golden boy of New York's elite circle.
Maverick was handsome, and I loved tagging along with him. I followed him around for seven years.
At 17, I realized I had feelings for Maverick, but he couldn't stand me. For a year, I loved him more than anything, but his friends called me a desperate simp, and everyone else said I was just a joke.
At eighteen, Maverick fell for Tessa. I watched him circle around her, then watched him sink into heartbreak.
At twenty-one, Maverick got drunk, pulled me onto his bed, and kissed me while whispering Tessa's name over and over.
I should have pushed him away and slapped him, but my hand faltered.
Dad's company was in a financial crisis and needed a fortune.
Being with Maverick had been my dream—and my parents'—for over a decade.
So I endured. However long Maverick tormented me, he kept calling out Tessa's name.
It didn't take long for Maverick's grandfather to find out. The Pruitt family was deeply traditional, and he ordered Maverick to marry me. I finally got what I'd wanted—I became Maverick's wife.
At twenty-two, I got pregnant. The baby was a handful, my morning sickness was brutal, and labor was even worse.
***
Memory is a tangled, relentless pain.
When I opened my eyes, I was lying in a hospital bed.
My whole body ached, and my head felt like it was splitting open.
Now, at 27, I watched my son call Tessa ""Mommy"" right in front of me—and my husband didn't object.
I pretended it didn't matter, but every moment stabbed at me.
The people I can't bear to lose are the ones wishing me to disappear.
I stayed quiet. Maybe happiness was never meant for me.
""Do you ever say cruel things to someone you love?"" I wanted to ask Maverick and Lewis.
But when they saw Tessa, I knew the answer.
Maverick had loved Tessa from the very first moment.
And Lewis liked Tessa from the first time he met her—he'd never shown that kind of affection for anyone else.
People always cling to what they fall for at first sight.
Lewis is becoming more like his father—looks, personality, taste.
They both love Tessa.
I never saw Tessa as the other woman.
Because from that night onward, I stole something that should have belonged to Tessa.
People suffer because they chase after the wrong things.
I think this marriage has run its course.
It's time to give Maverick and Lewis back to Tessa.
Chapter 5
The truth was, Maverick had drafted the divorce papers the very day Tessa returned.
He'd been wanting for this for a long time, eager to chase after Tessa again.
Just as he wished, I notified the Pruitt family's attorney and went with him to Maverick's office.
""I agree to the divorce,"" I said calmly, meeting his gaze.
Maverick looked a little surprised.
The attorney, Anton Bronson, handed each of us a copy of the divorce agreement.
I signed my name swiftly, the pen gliding across the paper.
But when it was Maverick's turn, his hand paused, his knuckles whitening around the pen.
Anton hesitated. ""Mr. Pruitt, you can take some time to think it over before signing.""
I understood Maverick's feelings.
Even a dog, after years together, would inspire affection.
And I'd been trailing after him for 16 years.
""Lewis stays with me,"" he said, watching me, his eyes searching.
I nodded.
I didn't want either of them anymore.
He looked at me deeply, as if hoping to catch a glimpse of sadness, heartbreak, or regret on my face.
But there was nothing.
He gripped the pen tightly, signing his name with an angry flourish, pressing so hard it seemed to carve into the page.
Meanwhile, I focused on the property settlement, satisfied as I left Maverick's office.
In the now quiet, empty room, Anton shivered, feeling the cold air radiating from Maverick.
""Mr. Pruitt, should we release a statement about your divorce from Mrs. Pruitt?""
""No need. She's just throwing a tantrum."" As he said it, Maverick seemed to comfort himself, his furrowed brow finally relaxing.
""Don't let the word get out. She'll come back on her own.""
""She's just lost her memory, forgotten about me and Lewis.
""She loves me so much, loves Lewis so much—she'll remember soon enough.
""The doctors said her amnesia is only temporary.
""When she remembers, she'll come running back in tears, begging me to take her back.
""This divorce is just punishment for how easily she forgot us.
""When she comes back crying and apologizing, I'll forgive her, and we'll get remarried.""
Thinking this, Maverick's frustration melted away. He picked up his coffee and took a sip.
Anton, drenched in sweat, pulled out a napkin to wipe his forehead.
""The divorce papers are signed, the assets divided—Mrs. Pruitt is just throwing a tantrum?"" he wondered silently.
As I was about to leave, I thought I'd feel heartbroken—after all, it had been my home for six years.
But I felt nothing but relief, as if I'd finally shed my shackles.
I was no longer someone's wife, someone's mother.
I didn't have to please anyone anymore or worry about who might dislike me.
While both of them were out, I called three moving companies, spending thousands of dollars to book three separate crews.
I packed up every luxury bag, dress, piece of jewelry, and skincare product I owned.
My baking tools, a cabinet full of handpicked designer plates and cutlery, a few pieces of furniture I was used to, and all the decorations I'd bought.
I even boxed up the expensive gifts I'd bought for Maverick and Lewis—gifts they never liked, shoved into the farthest corners of the cabinets. Even if I took them, they wouldn't notice.
So I might as well sell them secondhand and get some value out of them.
After all, we're divorced now. If they ever saw those unwanted things again, they'd probably just feel annoyed.
There was so much to pack, but thankfully, with three moving crews and plenty of hands, everything was loaded onto the trucks in under two hours.
The house felt suddenly empty. When Maverick came home, he'd probably think the place looked clean and tidy.
He'd always disliked clutter—now it was all gone.
I'd thoughtfully left plenty of space for the new lady of the house.
Before stepping out of the yard, I took one last look at the villa.
I knew I'd never return.

I’m a 25F and I met this coworker (25F) about a year or more ago through work. We weren’t close at first, but over time we fell into a routine of working closely together and spending a lot of one-on-one time during the day (coffee breaks, lunch walks, sitting together, collaborating on projects). There was never a formal “let’s be friends” moment, it just naturally escalated into something closer.

She has a boyfriend, which I’ve always respected, and I’ve never tried to cross explicit boundaries. That’s part of why this has been confusing rather than straightforward.

Over the past year, she’s done a lot of things that feel more intimate than a standard coworker friendship, which has led to mixed feelings on my end.

**For example:**

* She regularly initiates one-on-one time (walks, getting lunch, coffee, sitting together), even when other people are around. I also do the same now.
* Wearing my jackets/hoodies if she's cold.
* She shares personal insecurities & family stress. Not too often but sometimes.
* Physical contact. At one point we’ve escalated to kicking one another. Now it’s mostly nudging, sitting close, sharing food or drinks etc. I have noticed she seems more weary of my touch, especially if we hug goodbye compared to others.
* On a more relaxed day she sometimes compliments my shirts of other things, not too often though.
* We mirror each other moods, if one is feeling flat usually the other is. I don’t like this one personally, it sometimes feels like we’re both hyper aware of one another. She also seeks reassurance from me sometimes.
* I notice there will be days were she prioritises me socially in group settings, but other times pulls back suddenly. This includes offering to get my lunch if I'm super busy, giving me some of her food if she thinks I don't have enough etc.
* She’s hot-and-cold: some days very affectionate, jokey and attached, other days more withdrawn or guarded. I sometimes worry I’ve done something wrong.
* At the same time, she maintains her relationship and never explicitly crosses a line, which makes it hard to interpret intent. I don’t think she’s malicious or anything but it feels more like she enjoys closeness but doesn’t know what to do with it, or isn’t willing to confront what it might mean.

I feel like she can't fit me into a box, of either just 'coworker', 'friend', 'fun sometimes'.

I’m trying to understand whether this reads as:

* normal close friendship,
* emotional boundary-blurring,
* subconscious flirting without intention to act,
* or something else entirely.

I’d appreciate outside perspectives, especially from people who’ve experienced similar dynamics.",1,1766904828.0,TwoXChromosomes,2,0.67,False

The day we buried Jason, the ground was already too hard.

The priest said it was because of the cold; that late October had come early this year; but I knew better. Briar Hollow dirt had always been stubborn. Clay and stone packed tight, like it didn’t want to give anything back once it took it.

We stood in a crooked line beneath a sky the color of old tin. Jason’s mother cried quietly into a handkerchief that had been washed thin with years of use. His father didn’t cry at all. He just stared at the casket like it might explain itself if he waited long enough. I too, stared in silence, waiting for an answer I knew would never come in my lifetime. 

Best friend. That was the phrase people used when they shook my hand and said how sorry they were. Your best friend. It sounded smaller than it should have. Jason had been more than that. He was the kid who dared me to climb the quarry fence. The one who stayed up all night talking about getting out of Briar Hollow like it was a promise instead of a fantasy. The one who knew exactly what happened the summer of ’98 and never said a word.

They said it was an accident.

They always did.

I hadn’t been back in Briar Hollow for fourteen years, but standing there by the open grave, I felt like I’d never really left. The town had a way of keeping pieces of you. Jason was proof of that. He’d gotten out, sure; but some part of him had always stayed. And now the rest of him was being lowered into the ground like the town was finally collecting what it was owed.

When the service ended, people drifted away in small, murmuring groups. No one asked if I was staying. They already knew the answer before I did.

I left town that afternoon, drove until the cemetery disappeared in my rearview mirror, and told myself I was done.

I didn’t believe it. 

Two days later, I turned the car around. The town of Briar Hollow didn’t look like a place where anything bad should happen.

That was the first thing I thought when I crossed the welcome sign, the one that read:

WELCOME TO BRIAR HOLLOW

Pop. 2,914

A Nice Place to Live

Someone had scratched a thin line through the word Nice. I couldn’t remember when that had happened, which bothered me more than the scratch itself.

I hadn’t been back in fourteen years. Long enough that the town should have felt unfamiliar. It didn’t. It felt smaller, like a house you grow out of but never quite leave behind. The streets seemed shorter. The buildings leaned closer together. Even the sky looked lower, as if it had been pressing down while I was gone.

I rolled down the window and let the air in. Pine sap. Cold earth. Underneath it, something older; damp wood, rot, the smell of a place that had been closed too long.

Briar Hollow went quite early. It always had. Porch lights clicked on at dusk. Curtains were drawn. The woods crept close, patient and unashamed.

People called it peaceful. I knew better.

I parked outside Mabel’s Diner just after noon. The awning was still there, faded red letters peeling like dead skin. When I stepped inside, the bell rang, and the conversations dipped, not enough to stop, just enough to notice.

Mabel poured me coffee without asking.

“You’re back,” she said.

I nodded. “Looks that way.”

She studied my face like she was checking for cracks. “Staying long?”

“I don’t know.”

“No one ever does,” she said, and turned away.

The coffee tasted burnt. It always had. I drank it anyway.

As I sat there, I felt it, that sensation I’d hoped was just memory. The feeling that the town was aware of me. Not watching exactly, but noticing. Like Briar Hollow had taken attendance and found my name missing, and now it was correcting the error.

When I paid and stood to leave, Mabel leaned closer.

“You should stay away from Hollow Road,” she said, her voice low, like she as trying to hide something. 

I paused. “Why?”

She smiled too quickly. “Just old gossip.”

Her hands were shaking.

I saw the Bellamy House that evening.

I hadn’t planned to go that way, but plans didn’t mean much in Briar Hollow. The road narrowed, pavement cracking into gravel, and there it was at the end, slumped, sagging, exhausted. It looked like a house that was tired of pretending to be alive.

Arthur Bellamy had died there alone. Everyone knew that, found days later. The smell lingered longer than it should have. After that, the house emptied itself. No buyers. No renters. Just time and rot.

And light.

The upstairs window glowed a faint yellow.

I stopped the car.

It shouldn’t have been on. No one lived there. Kids didn’t go inside anymore, not after what happened to Tommy Pike back in ’98, though no one ever said exactly what had happened to him.

“Must be kids,” I said out loud.

The words sounded thin.

The light didn’t flicker. It didn’t move. It just glowed, steady and patient, like it had been waiting.

That night, the town didn’t sleep well.

I dreamed I was standing at the edge of the woods behind the Bellamy House. I could hear someone saying my name, softly, like they were testing the sound of it. I woke up before I saw who it was.

At 2:13 a.m., a freight train passed through town, its horn long and mournful. I remembered thinking it wasn’t scheduled until morning.

By sunrise, everyone pretended none of it mattered.

They always did.

The next afternoon, I ran into Evan Mercer at the hardware store.

The bell rang when I stepped inside, and Evan looked up from the counter. His face did something strange, like it was trying to remember how to smile.

“Well,” he said. “I’ll be damned. If it isn’t Caleb Burke.” He chuckled as he wandered over. 

“Hey, Ev.”

We shook hands, the grip awkward, careful. Two men standing on top of the ghosts of boys we used to be.

“You here for good?” he asked.

“For now.”

He nodded like that confirmed something he hadn’t wanted to be right about.

“You hear about the Bellamy place?” he asked.

“No.”

“Lights were on last night.”

“So someone bought it.”

Evan snorted. “No one buys that house.”

The store felt colder suddenly.

“You feel it too, don’t you?” he said, lowering his voice.

I didn’t ask what he meant. “Yeah.”

Neither of us laughed.

That evening, the light came on again.

This time, people noticed. Cars slowed on Hollow Road. Someone stopped long enough to get honked at. The glow was brighter now, more confident.

At 9:47 p.m., the power went out across town.

Everything died at once, TVs, porch lights, the low hum of refrigerators. For a moment, Briar Hollow was swallowed whole by darkness.

Then the lights began to return.

One by one.

Except at the Bellamy House.

The upstairs window burned brighter than ever.

I stood on my porch and watched it, my skin prickling. The woods behind the house whispered without wind. I thought I saw something move between the trees, something tall and thin, its shape wrong where the shadows clung to it.

Inside the Bellamy House, the floorboards creaked.

Someone was walking upstairs.

All over town, doors were locked. Curtains were pulled tight. People told themselves the same lie they always had:

Nothing ever happens here.

I knew better.

I’d just come home.

Chapter 2.

I woke up at 3:06 a.m. with my name in my mouth.

Not spoken; held there, like I’d almost said it out loud but stopped myself at the last second. My heart was pounding hard enough that I could feel it in my throat. For a moment I didn’t know where I was. The ceiling above me was unfamiliar, too smooth, too clean. Then memory slid back into place.

I was in my childhood bedroom.

My mother had kept it exactly the same after I left, as if time might notice and stop out of politeness. Same pale blue walls. Same dresser with the loose handle. Same faint crack in the ceiling that looked like a lightning bolt if you stared at it long enough.

The house was quiet.

Too quiet.

No wind rattling the windows. No distant hum of cars on Route 11. Even the old refrigerator downstairs; which used to click and sigh like it was alive; had gone silent.

I sat up slowly, that was when I heard it. Footsteps.

Not in the house. Outside. They came from the direction of Hollow Road.

I moved to the window and pushed the curtain aside just enough to see. My porch light was off, but the moon was bright, casting everything in dull silver. The yard looked the same as it always had; patchy grass, the crooked oak at the edge, the fence Jason and I had climbed a hundred times.

The Bellamy House stood in the distance. The upstairs light was on.

It burned steady and yellow against the dark, a single unblinking eye. As I watched, something moved at the window. Not enough to see clearly; just a shift, a suggestion of shape pulling back from the glass.

The footsteps stopped.

For a terrible second, I was sure they had stopped because whoever, or whatever, had realized I was watching.

Then the light went out.

I stood there long after, staring at the dark outline of the house, until my reflection replaced it in the glass. When I finally lay back down, sleep didn’t come easy. When it did, it brought Jason with it.

Jason looked the way he had at seventeen; too thin, hair falling into his eyes, that crooked smile that made everything seem like a joke even when it wasn’t. We were standing by the quarry fence, the one we’d sworn we’d never cross again.

“You shouldn’t have come back,” he said.

“I didn’t have a choice,” I told him.

He shook his head. “You always think that.”

I opened my mouth to argue, and the ground gave way beneath us.

I woke up choking.

The morning felt wrong.

Sunlight streamed through the windows, but it didn’t warm anything. The house stayed cold, the kind of cold that clung to your skin instead of sinking into it. I made coffee and let it go untouched on the counter while I stared out the window at the woods.

Jason’s funeral replayed itself in pieces. The sound of dirt hitting wood. His mother’s hand clutching my sleeve. The way the priest avoided saying how Jason died; only that he had.

Accident.

I’d heard the word so many times growing up that it barely meant anything anymore.

I grabbed my jacket and went out.

The cemetery sat at the edge of town, where the woods grew thick and the road narrowed like it was trying to discourage visitors. Jason’s grave was still fresh; the dirt darker than the rest; the headstone temporary and pale.

I stood there longer than I meant to.

“You weren’t supposed to stay,” I said quietly.

The words vanished into the trees.

Something else lingered.

I felt it again; that awareness. The same one I’d felt at Mabel’s. The same one I’d felt watching the Bellamy House. It wasn’t watching me from the grave. It was watching through it.

I left with the uneasy certainty that Jason wasn’t finished with Briar Hollow.

Or Briar Hollow wasn’t finished with him.

Evan Mercer was already in his store when I walked in later that afternoon. He looked like he hadn’t slept.

“Rough night?” I asked.

He snorted. “That obvious?”

“You ever see the light go out?” I said.

Evan froze. “What light?”

“The one in the Bellamy House.”

He hesitated too long. “No.”

That told me everything.

I leaned on the counter. “Jason died three miles from Hollow Road.”

Evan’s eyes flicked to the door, then back to me. “You shouldn’t say that out loud.”

“Why?”

“Because people might hear.”

“Who?” He didn’t answer.

After a moment, he said, “Jason came in here a week before he died.” That stopped me.

“He asked about the Bellamy place,” Evan went on. “Asked if anyone’d been inside lately. Asked if I remembered ’98.”

My stomach tightened. “What did you tell him?”

“The truth,” Evan said. “That some places don’t stay empty. They just wait.”

The bell over the door rang suddenly, sharp as a gunshot. We both jumped.

A woman stepped inside; Mrs. Hargreeve from Maple Street. She looked smaller than I remembered, folded in on herself like a paper doll.

“I need locks,” she said. “All new ones.”

“For the front door?” Evan asked.

“For every door,” she said. “And the windows.”

Evan rang her up without comment. As she left, she looked at me.

“You look just like Jason,” she said.

Then she was gone. That night, the power stayed on. The light in the Bellamy House did not. Instead, something else happened.

At exactly 2:13 a.m., a knock sounded at my front door.

Three slow raps.

I stood in the hallway, heart hammering, staring at the door like it might open itself. The knock came again, patient and deliberate.

I knew; without knowing how; that if I opened it, something would change. That once the door was open, it wouldn’t be so easy to close again.

I thought of Jason. Of the quarry. Of the things we’d promised never to talk about. I opened the door. No one stood there. But the air was colder. And from the direction of Hollow Road, I heard footsteps heading back toward the Bellamy House.

Chapter 3.

The Briar Hollow Public Library smelled like dust and lemon cleaner, the way it always had. It sat just off Main Street in a squat brick building that looked more like a bunker than a place for books. Growing up, Evan and I used to come here to escape summer heat and adults who asked too many questions. It felt wrong being back for this.

We didn’t talk much on the way in.

The librarian on duty was Mrs. Calder, who had been old when I was a kid and somehow managed to look exactly the same now. She peered at us over her glasses, eyes sharp and assessing.

“You’re the Mercer boy,” she said to Evan.

“And you’re Caleb Burke,” she added, turning to me. “Jason’s friend.”

The word was went unsaid.

“We’re looking for old newspapers,” Evan said. “Local ones.”

Mrs. Calder’s mouth tightened, just slightly. “Microfilm’s in the back.”

She didn’t ask what year.

The microfilm room hummed softly, the machine casting pale light across the table. Evan fed reels into the reader while I took notes on scrap paper I found in my jacket pocket. I wasn’t sure what I was looking for, not exactly. I just knew the town had teeth, and I wanted to see where they’d sunk in before.

Disappearances. Accidents. Missing persons.

Things people forgot on purpose.

I started broad; twenty years back, then narrowed. I skimmed headlines, scanned columns.

LOCAL MAN DROWNED IN QUARRY

HUNTER LOST IN WOODS FOUND TWO DAYS LATER

RUNAWAY RETURNS HOME SAFELY.

Most of it was ordinary. Too ordinary.

Then I noticed a pattern.

People didn’t go missing in Briar Hollow.

They vanished quietly. No follow-ups. No investigations that lasted longer than a paragraph. Names appeared once, then never again.

I flipped forward.

October. This year.

My hand stopped moving.

The headline sat there, clean and black against yellowed digital print.

I stared at the headline longer than I meant to.

LOCAL MAN DIES FROM BLOOD LOSS FOLLOWING SINGLE-VEHICLE ACCIDENT

Blood loss.

Not traumatic injuries.

Not internal bleeding.

Just blood loss.

I scrolled down, heart ticking faster with each line.

Jason Maxim, 31, was discovered inside his vehicle after it left the roadway along Hollow Road late Tuesday evening. Authorities reported no signs of struggle. Cause of death was determined to be blood loss. Investigation ongoing.

Blood loss from what?

“There’s no mention of wounds,” I said.

Evan leaned closer, reading over my shoulder. “Car accidents don’t work like that.”

“No,” I agreed. “They don’t.”

I scrolled again.

A smaller paragraph, buried like it hoped not to be noticed:

Emergency responders noted the absence of significant external trauma. Medical examiners declined further comment.

My hands went cold.

“No external trauma,” I repeated. “Then where did the blood go?”

Evan didn’t answer right away. When he did, his voice was low.

“Check the autopsy notice.”

I found it two pages later, printed in that sterile, municipal tone meant to kill curiosity.

CAUSE OF DEATH: EXSANGUINATION

The word sat there, ugly and clinical.

Exsanguination.

Complete loss of blood.

I swallowed hard. “That’s not how accidents kill people.”

“No,” Evan said. “That’s how animals feed.”

The hum of the microfilm machine felt louder now, like it was breathing.

I kept reading.

The article mentioned two small puncture wounds along the neck, described quickly, dismissively.

Likely caused by debris during impact.

“Debris doesn’t leave matching holes,” I said.

Jason hated doctors. He hated needles. If someone had put their hands on his throat, if something had…

I pushed the thought away too late.

Another correction appeared two days later, smaller than the first.

Update: Authorities confirm no foul play suspected. Injuries consistent with animal activity post-mortem.

Post-mortem.

I felt sick.

“They’re lying,” I said.

Evan nodded. “They always do.”

We went back further.

Nineteen ninety-eight.

The year blinked onto the screen like it had been waiting.

The language was familiar now.

Vague causes. Missing details. Words chosen carefully to avoid the truth.

LOCAL BOY FOUND ALIVE AFTER TWO DAYS; SUFFERED SEVERE BLOOD LOSS

I leaned back slowly.

Tommy Pike.

“He didn’t disappear,” I said. “He was drained.”

Evan’s jaw tightened.

Another article followed.

Doctors report extreme anemia. Cause unknown.

Extreme.

Unknown.

“They didn’t know then,” I said. “Or they didn’t want to.”

Evan tapped the screen. “Look at the location.”

Hollow Road.

Every time.

My name appeared later. So did Evan’s. Jason’s.

TEENS QUESTIONED AFTER TRESPASSING INCIDENT NEAR BELLAMY PROPERTY

They called it trespassing.

They didn’t call it what it was.

I remembered the smell inside the house; metallic and sweet. I remembered the shapes moving where they shouldn’t. I remembered Jason pulling Tommy free, screaming at me not to look back.

Jason had gone back. Not because he was stupid. Because he knew.

“He wasn’t drunk,” I said quietly. “He wasn’t alone. And he didn’t crash.”

Evan met my eyes. “He was hunted.” 

The word hung between us.

Outside the library, dusk had begun to settle. Briar Hollow was dimming its lights, pulling in on itself. Somewhere on Hollow Road, something old and hungry was still awake. Jason’s death certificate said blood loss. The town said accident. But I knew the truth now. Something had fed. And it hadn’t finished.

Chapter 4.

I left the library alone.

Evan offered to walk me out, but I told him I needed the air. That wasn’t a lie. The truth was I needed space to think without the hum of machines and the weight of old ink pressing down on me. Briar Hollow felt different once you noticed its gaps; the places where people should have been and weren’t.

It was fully dark by the time I reached my car.

The streetlights cast long, broken shadows across Main Street. I unlocked the door, slid inside, and sat there longer than necessary with my hands on the steering wheel, breathing. My reflection in the windshield looked pale, older than it had that morning.

I started the engine.

Halfway home, the road narrowed. I hadn’t meant to take Hollow Road.

I told myself that afterward, but it wasn’t true. My hands had turned the wheel on their own. The trees closed in, their branches knitting together overhead. My headlights carved a shallow tunnel through the dark, and beyond it, there was nothing.

The radio crackled.

Then died. I slowed, looking out my windscreen as my heart pounded.

That was when something crossed the road.

I slammed the brakes.

The car skidded, tires screaming, and stopped sideways across the lane. My heart hammered so hard I thought it might break a rib. I leaned forward, peering through the windshield.

Nothing stood there.

“Jesus,” I muttered.

I reached to put the car in drive, and something hit the driver’s side window.

Not hard enough to break it. Hard enough to announce itself. I turned, eyes wide.

A face hovered inches from the glass.

Not animal. Not human.

The skin was pale, stretched too tight, veins faintly visible beneath it. The eyes were wrong, not glowing, not red, just empty in a way that suggested hunger rather than sight. Its mouth opened slightly, and I saw teeth that were too long, too narrow, like they’d been sharpened by use.

It smiled at me.

I screamed and threw the car into reverse.

The tires spun. The thing slid along the window, fingers scraping, nails leaving pale lines in the glass. It moved with me effortlessly, keeping pace until the headlights caught it full-on.

Its body bent wrong, folding back into the trees like smoke pulled by wind.

I didn’t stop driving. I didn’t look back.

I hit my driveway so hard I nearly took out the mailbox. 

Inside the house, I locked every door, then slid down against the wall and shook until my teeth clicked. My hands were slick with blood.

Not from a bite.

From my forearm.

Three long gashes, deep and angry, like something had tested me. The cuts burned, edges darkening already. I stared at them, heart racing.

It could have killed me. It didn’t.

That was worse.

I cleaned the wounds in the bathroom sink.

Hydrogen peroxide fizzed, white and violent. I bit down on a towel to keep from yelling. The cuts weren’t that deep, but they felt wrong, like they didn’t belong to me anymore. I wrapped them tight, pulled on a long-sleeved shirt, and sat on the edge of the tub until the shaking stopped.

I didn’t sleep.

I listened.

Every creak of the house sounded deliberate. Every whisper of wind through the trees felt like breath against my neck. At 2:13 a.m., something moved outside, but it didn’t knock.

That felt intentional.

Evan took one look at me the next morning and swore.

“Jesus, Caleb.”

“I’m fine,” I said automatically.

“You’re bleeding.”

I hadn’t realized it had soaked through the bandage.

We were standing behind the hardware store, out of sight of Main Street. Evan pulled me toward the back door and locked it behind us.

“What happened?” he asked.

“I wasn’t bitten,” I said. “If that’s what you’re thinking.”

“That’s not what I’m thinking,” he said. “It’s what I’m afraid of.”

I rolled up my sleeve.

The color drained from his face.

“They marked you,” he said.

“Marked me how?”

“Like Jason,” Evan said quietly. “Like Tommy.”

I stared at him. “Jason was bitten?”

“No,” Evan said. “He was drained. There’s a difference.” My stomach turned.

“They don’t always feed,” Evan went on. “Sometimes they just… check.”

“For what?”

“For timing.”

That was when the bell over the front door rang.

A couple walked in, young, laughing, hands tangled together. College-aged. They browsed aisles without urgency, like nothing bad had ever happened to them.

I felt cold all over.

“That’s how it works,” Evan said after they left. “Cycles. Every few years, it starts again.”

“How long?” I asked.

Evan didn’t answer right away.

Then: “About a week.”

The radio crackled on the counter.

LOCAL COUPLE REPORTED MISSING AFTER EVENING WALK NEAR HOLLOW ROAD.

I closed my eyes.

“They don’t feed randomly,” I said. “They rotate.”

“Families,” Evan said. “Outsiders. Then someone who knows.”

Jason.

“And if someone escapes?” I asked.

Evan met my eyes.

“They come back.”

Outside, the day went on like nothing had changed. Cars passed. People talked about the weather.

Somewhere in the woods, something had tasted me.

I’m a 25F and I met this coworker (25F) about a year or more ago through work. We weren’t close at first, but over time we fell into a routine of working closely together and spending a lot of one-on-one time during the day (coffee breaks, lunch walks, sitting together, collaborating on projects). There was never a formal “let’s be friends” moment, it just naturally escalated into something closer.

She has a boyfriend, which I’ve always respected, and I’ve never tried to cross explicit boundaries. That’s part of why this has been confusing rather than straightforward.

Over the past year, she’s done a lot of things that feel more intimate than a standard coworker friendship, which has led to mixed feelings on my end.

**For example:**

* She regularly initiates one-on-one time (walks, getting lunch, coffee, sitting together), even when other people are around. I also do the same now.
* Wearing my jackets/hoodies if she's cold.
* She shares personal insecurities & family stress. Not too often but sometimes.
* Physical contact. At one point we’ve escalated to kicking one another. Now it’s mostly nudging, sitting close, sharing food or drinks etc. I have noticed she seems more weary of my touch, especially if we hug goodbye compared to others.
* On a more relaxed day she sometimes compliments my shirts of other things, not too often though.
* We mirror each other moods, if one is feeling flat usually the other is. I don’t like this one personally, it sometimes feels like we’re both hyper aware of one another. She also seeks reassurance from me sometimes.
* I notice there will be days were she prioritises me socially in group settings, but other times pulls back suddenly. This includes offering to get my lunch if I'm super busy, giving me some of her food if she thinks I don't have enough etc.
* She’s hot-and-cold: some days very affectionate, jokey and attached, other days more withdrawn or guarded. I sometimes worry I’ve done something wrong.
* At the same time, she maintains her relationship and never explicitly crosses a line, which makes it hard to interpret intent. I don’t think she’s malicious or anything but it feels more like she enjoys closeness but doesn’t know what to do with it, or isn’t willing to confront what it might mean.

I feel like she can't fit me into a box, of either just 'coworker', 'friend', 'fun sometimes'.

I’m trying to understand whether this reads as:

* normal close friendship,
* emotional boundary-blurring,
* subconscious flirting without intention to act,
* or something else entirely.

Over the years, their relationship became very close. At one point, the friend started sending my boyfriend nude photos, saying he likes showing off.

I’m a 25F and I met this coworker (25F) about a year or more ago through work. We weren’t close at first, but over time we fell into a routine of working closely together and spending a lot of one-on-one time during the day (coffee breaks, lunch walks, sitting together, collaborating on projects). There was never a formal “let’s be friends” moment, it just naturally escalated into something closer.

She has a boyfriend, which I’ve always respected, and I’ve never tried to cross explicit boundaries. That’s part of why this has been confusing rather than straightforward.

Over the past year, she’s done a lot of things that feel more intimate than a standard coworker friendship, which has led to mixed feelings on my end.

**For example:**

* She regularly initiates one-on-one time (walks, getting lunch, coffee, sitting together), even when other people are around. I also do the same now.
* Wearing my jackets/hoodies if she's cold.
* She shares personal insecurities & family stress. Not too often but sometimes.
* Physical contact. At one point we’ve escalated to kicking one another. Now it’s mostly nudging, sitting close, sharing food or drinks etc. I have noticed she seems more weary of my touch, especially if we hug goodbye compared to others.
* On a more relaxed day she sometimes compliments my shirts of other things, not too often though.
* We mirror each other moods, if one is feeling flat usually the other is. I don’t like this one personally, it sometimes feels like we’re both hyper aware of one another. She also seeks reassurance from me sometimes.
* I notice there will be days were she prioritises me socially in group settings, but other times pulls back suddenly.  This includes offering to get my lunch if I'm super busy, giving me some of her food if she thinks I don't have enough etc.
* She’s hot-and-cold: some days very affectionate, jokey and attached, other days more withdrawn or guarded. I sometimes worry I’ve done something wrong.
* At the same time, she maintains her relationship and never explicitly crosses a line, which makes it hard to interpret intent. I don’t think she’s malicious or anything but it feels more like she enjoys closeness but doesn’t know what to do with it, or isn’t willing to confront what it might mean.

I feel like she can't fit me into a box, of either just 'coworker', 'friend', 'fun sometimes'.

I’m trying to understand whether this reads as:

* normal close friendship, 
* emotional boundary-blurring, 
* subconscious flirting without intention to act,
* or something else entirely.

I’d appreciate outside perspectives, especially from people who’ve experienced similar dynamics.",0,1766904519.0,relationship_advice,9,0.25,False

Listen to on my YT playlist. Blood Sport, Take Aim, Infinite Baths and you can even shuffle my YT created playlist for an experience while reading my very interesting bio 🌸","Princess of Veridian and her favorite Sleep Token songs 🌸

Yeah, this is my YT playlist and these Sleep Token songs are my favorite because of the deep meaning the lyrics can say so much about me as a person.

Yeah, the lyrics can tell you what themes bounces around my Vessel brain frequently.

If you don't know what Sleep Token is, I'm not being rude here or mean, obviously joining the my Discord server isn't the place you should be joining to ask all your questions making me look like an embarrassing Discord server owner.

Yeah, every single Discord member knows what Sleep Token is in the server and people that have never heard of the band are asking that question in the Discord server.

Yeah, I'm not trying to be mean here and that's not my goal at all trying to be mean at all.

However, asking in the Discord server what is Sleep Token and is Sleep Token a band is embarrassing, obviously that makes me look bad as a Discord server owner that is trying to promote the Discord server on Reddit.

Yeah, I'm REALLY obviously not joking when I said I had to kick out a few people yesterday for asking these questions.

What is Sleep Token, is Sleep Token a band? What are you members talking about in this server I don't understand and what is deity Sleep?

Yeah, I'm not understanding what your Discord server members are talking about 😭

The thing that you don't realize is this could make the whole Discord server that knows what Sleep Token is could make them think that I'm promoting this Discord server for random people to join to rack up the Discord server numbers of members up.

Which yeah, I don't want that promotional image on me.

The only thing I can ask is if you listen to Sleep Token FIRSt and IF you need a beginner guide that is already provided in the Discord server link underneath the hashtag Discord server owner intro.

Yeah, you can find a guidesheet there and helpful tips to get you started with the lore without asking too many questions in the general hashtags.

However, there IS a hashtag for further discussion about the lore for people that are further curious about the Sleep Token Lore.

That hashtag is where you can find people discussing Sleep Toke lore in that hashtag.

However, enough of that and we should focus on a simple bio.

Warning: long bio post (nothing hidden.)

What is your name and when I add you I want to know what I should call you as a greeting? 

Yeah, I've recently decided to come out and announce that I'm a DID system/host and alters that are named E and S, their enjoyment comes from nicknames. 

My real life name is for family members call me by my real life name only, my family doesn't even understand why I dye my hair, why I listen to the music I listen to, why I want a lot of hyper-fixation with band merchandise and you expect them to understand my complex Vessel brain, obviously that has to be a joke.

1 of my family members told me once and this is before we cut off contact unless it's a family emergency that psychologist text are inaccurate, obviously what this 1 family member was saying was that you should question your own psychologist and paperwork to question the accuracy because the test is a general test and psychologist test aren't ''official.''

1 of my family members has asked me as well that I shouldn't take my proper adult autistic diagnosis seriously and I should question the accuracy of my report 🤣

However, let's move on and let's talk about Sleep Token to make this bio more less ''is your family okay?'' 💀

Sleep Token is what's keeping me in a needle of the thread, Sleep Token is my current hyper-fixation, happiness and I cannot see myself stopping buying shirts. Even if I were to have 10 shirts one day, I'll still keep collecting the shirt designs that speak to me and the rare limited numbered merchandise as well.

My style is Temu/Walmart alternative fashion person 🤣 Yeah, you don't need tattoos or piercings to message me and why don't I have tattoos? Yeah, you've to pay hundreds of dollars for a good tattoo. I can't afford that and I can see my family besides my sibling having a mini-stroke that I got a tattoo. 

Can we be friends if I listen to other genres of music?

If you're a fan of country or rap music, then I just don't know if we could match unless you would want someone that enjoys Lo-Fi as a second option besides a variety of rock, metal and core genres of music then 🤣

Yeah, if you don't want to hear about Sleep Token every single day and I could be just annoying at times for you, yeah I also do send emojis every few sentences and sometimes just 1 if you're annoyed by emoji usage as well.

Yeah, I know this doesn't help much/to make things better and I'm the type of person that won't give you poor conversations unless you tell me hi and ask a deep introverted person what she's doing every single day.

When my life is basically on a repeat loop with barely doing anything by choice and I don't have what you call a socialized family life by their own choices.

Yeah, I wonder how many people would want to hear someone text every single day. I just go on YT, listen to music and find something to watch on YT.

The next thing I'd do is either go on Pandora and then go YT for music, which I think I'm leaning on YT for music more than Pandora, I then listen to music for a while. Then I go back to YT or gaming.

The next thing I'd is I plan to next month buy Final Fantasy 12 Zodiac age because I've lost the game somewhere and I don't know if I'm going to get a new Nintendo Switch game anytime soon, sorry but band merchandise is more important imo ⭐

However, this is why it's probably best for one of us to pick up the conversation where one of us left off, rather than asking what's up every single day when sht don't change.

The thing is that users from this direct post need to realize as well I've no interest in meeting any of you in person because without going into personal details I live underneath the government rules and government funding to at least barely function and live off once-per month.

Which means in translation I'm too broke to see anyone in person and I also get interrogated by the government if I fly somewhere out of state.

Yeah, I'm not looking for a friend to permanently take care of me, what I'm seeing is just best friends on the internet and just give me a reason to look forward to the next day that I will be happy to receive your phone notifications.

The next comment I want to address is seeing posts that people are tired of being ghosted and disposed of close to a fashion trend and tired of that.

That's the sad thing about society culture now, that once someone no longer has a use for you and they got the conversations they wanted to have with you, it's onto the next person, rinse and repeat.

Why do you say on your posts on subreddits for friendship and other connections that you're looking for future best friends? That's weird you're asking for best friends right away and quickly.

Uh, do you know what the future means? That means far-away from now, obviously if you think we can become best friends in a week then that will be on you and not me and that's because.

Yeah, I no longer ask. Recently I made a friend on Tumblr which I don't use anymore who told me I shouldn't be saying the word bestie when we've been friends for two weeks and I should watch what I say to others. Yeah, don't ask me what their problem was/were, however there are some REALLY creepy people on Tumblr and I left.

Yeah, I left Tumblr after I met a crazy ex-person on there trying to compete with my Discord server, they even removed 4 people from my Discord server that were her spy friends apparently and moved them over to create their server. Yeah, after that I left, because this user had problems. They screenshot my bio on Reddit where I said I had DID and sent that out to my followers on Tumblr.

Yeah, I left. I'm not dealing with nuts and I'm not going to deal with someone that wants to hurt or cause drama for my Discord server.

However, let's move on from Tumblr drama and let's just explain what I mean if you would want to help provide moderation for the Discord server, the Sleep Token subreddit and the FB group I recently created. These rules are super-easy and trust me you won't be having high demands as a moderator in Arcadia. 

Yeah, when I mean about helping run a Sleep Token subreddit, I mean just daily maintenance and no I'm not asking the moderators of the subreddit to check every minute of their life on the subreddit. The rules are simple/straight-forward/easy. Just check once or twice a day to check for this content on the subreddit that I've created.

However, you can let me know in a dms if this interests you or not and I think that's better off that way, obviously that is because I don't want you to feel disappointed that you're not interested in help moderating the Sleep Token subreddit community. The thing is, you don't need to be an obsessed or hyper-fixated fan of Sleep Token.

The thing that I'm asking is to make sure nobody is posting spam links, spam content, revealing personal information about the band members' real life names and obsession with the band members taking their masks off in a live show.

That's what I'm asking. If this interests you, then you can message me in a few days and I may/might ask if you want to help moderate the server if I feel confident enough to ask, if you obviously don't ask first.


Version II bio-the not super-pleasant topics to talk about before ending this post. 

Yeah, I normally don't go out of my way to find a new band or discover a new band, unless someone tells me about a band to check out and if I'm using Pandora at the time. However, I prefer YT music though and not Pandora, however Pandora does offer to find new bands more in the que/recommendations,

However, that's not my main interest right now to spend money on YT music and Pandora music at the same time.

Yeah, my interest right now is just using my YT channel playlist that I've made instead of paying for membership for either of those apps currently. However, you may have a question on a post that I've made recently with this text.
Sibling likes to argue about my music, hates my music, yeah we don't have that strong sibling bond anymore and have been falling apart lately, the sibling connection is close to a standpoint of ""we tolerate each other, even though we obviously annoy each other attitude.""

""We occasionally enjoy each other's company ever so often and not often is preferred.

Yeah, for 🎄 yeah, you guys already know that I've asked for Sleep Token shirts from my sibling (my sibling hates this band that I recently found out but tolerates my hyper-fixations) and I got some cute figures and stuffed animals from my sibling's spouses' family.

Yeah, I'd rather not discuss anything about this further, obviously this is way too dramatic of a response of why someone should hate a band.

My sibling says that.

Sleep Token makes her depression worse, sad sad and how can you listen to these awful lyrics? Yeah, you don't get even more depressed when you listen to this stuff my sibling asked me in the car.

Yeah, I just turned my sibling out in the car and said nothing.

My sibling even kept on skipping their songs on my playlist in the car.

Yeah, that's just extremely disrespectful and rude. Yeah, my sibling we only text 1-once or twice a week and that's all. We just don't have that sibling ''spark anymore.''

Well, I might as well go make a ''suitable playlist next time I visit my sibling and lucky that is super way off from happening.''

The only thing I'm going to add to that playlist is video game remixes and Lo-Fi tracks because I'm not going to put rap music on there and this is just how I'm going to fix things here.

Yeah, speaking of my music style, do I dye my hair and do I stick with the same color of hair dye?

My hair is dyed dark red at the roots and my ends dark brown. Yeah, I've been dying my hair this hair color for this whole year of 2025, as dark reds and browns are what is in my style of what I want to dye my hair color right now.

Yeah, this month though I decided to dye my hair dark maroon black and dark brown on my ends, obviously I'm HATING this color combo, because you can barely see the dark maroon color and the color is fading not in a pretty shade as I would've wanted.

Yeah, in January 2026 I'm going to find a red velvet hair dye and go back to my usual dark brown hair dye that I use for my ends.

Yeah, that's why I look for friendships, other connections online about music and that's because all my family members do is sht on my music and have told me in the past that this is how my music is to them.

This isn't my sibling, these are all my family members that I barely have any contact with unless it's an emergency that they think my music is this style.

My music is devil worshipping as well, summoning the devil, satanic lyrics and 1 of my family members thinks that the lyrics that I enjoy are a vast majority of bands sing how to summon a demon and all metal talks about the grim reaper and death 🤣

Get this, before the vast majority of the family members that I have had a lot of contact with and don't anymore for personal reasons, doesn't think I'm telling the truth 🤣

There is 1 family member thinks that vast majority of metal bands that I listen to are ALL singing about the grim reaper, worshipping the devil and even with proof that 1 family member thinks I'm lying and all metal bands are the grim reapers 🤣

Yeah, obviously does this make sense now why I've nowhere to turn to make new connections besides Reddit and Discord friends 🤣

Am I doing anything on the New Year?

No, maybe just ordering Chinese food or just getting me McDonald's and maybe buying a new Final Fantasy game, I've been missing playing Final Fantasy Zodiac Age and the game is lost, have been looking for the game for a while and I can't find the Final Fantasy game.

Well I'm not going to do anything but sit on my bed like a couch, try to complete the winter event on Fall Guys and maybe do a fast food order on McDonald's 🤣

What's your favorite and least favorite mobile order? Last thing you might ask is why won't you see anyone in person that you text on Reddit/Discord? Weird?

Not weird, I'm too broke being on SSI and the rules that I live in my state. I've to be responsible to pay for the plane ticket as I'm not allowed for others to pay for my plane ticket without getting my SSI in jeopardy and I could have my SSI check revoked.

The only thing I've money for every single month is paying my host home half of rent until I get my own government funding apartment that I've already applied for/got approved (just on a waiting list.) bills, whatever food stamps doesn't cover, band merchandise and video games 🤣

Yeah, I even have 1 online friend that I've been with for years and even told me that the reason why they never saw me for those 5 years is the lack of funds there isn't enough left over each month for a plane ticket.

There was an ex-friend of mine a month ago in November arguing with me that my family shouldn't treat me this way, it's unfair, he doesn't enjoy/like that my family life is toxic and we can't become friends anymore because of this vibe. 

Uh, well can I say this for people that want to come in my life? 

Yeah, you're never going to meet my family and you're never going to meet me in person unless you're highly interested in paying for your plane ticket, your rent car, guest are only allowed to stay in my apartment whenever I get my apartment either in 2026 in summer/spring and the start of 2027 for three days. 

Yeah, the thing is you might reflect back on my post and say your online friend that you've been with for a few years is lying to you that they can't afford a plane ticket and probably doesn't want to admit that they don't want to see you.

Uh, that's false, quite insensitive for you to think that, quite insensitive for you to judge my online friend that I've been with for years that you don't even know and that toxic thinking is something I'm not into inviting in my life.The reason why my online friend that I've been with for a few years can't see me in person is this.

Currently without giving too much identifying personal information, which I will not do and provide is this.

My online friend that I have been friends with for a few years can only have a max of 3k in her bank with my online friend being on SSI (state by state is different, mine only allows 2k.) 

With frequent medical bills that only half of my online friend medical health insurance will pay, my online friend is taking expensive supplements that are helping with their auto- immune diseases that they they've and taking care of their pets.

Then adding my online friend paying for their own groceries, bills, paying a car bill and trying to find a low income apartment to live in, obviously do you think by this point my online friend has enough money for a plane ticket?

Yeah, even my online friend had to get a part time job because my online friend told me that the only way that they can afford all this now with the rise of the cost of living is if they get a part time job and that even with a part time job they still can't afford a plane ticket. Which, let me say this and this needs to be addressed.

Yeah, I've been dumped in the past for friendships even though the friendships were online got tired of me being broke and not willing to change to make myself not broke anymore, obviously not living on the government income anymore.

However, my past ex-friends that I met on BlueSky which I no longer have a BlueSky account and my previous forgotten account made announcements and acknowledgement to my post that I'm not going to change my financial lifestyle.

This was made as an acknowledgement in several of my past-posts and several users thought I was lying to them and I was going to change my financial ways of living. 

Yeah, once they found out the truth that I wasn't all my friends left me in fall and the start of winter of 2025. 

Yeah, don't ask me why people think I'm lying, not being truthful about my situation and why they think I've a high-dishonest rate about me, obviously when I've been too honest without giving personal identifying information and people won't waste their time on me.

However, I don't think that's in the right of me to tell my friend this.

''Goodbye, I guess I'll never see you because you've chosen your own living expenses over seeing me which has been a few years now and I guess you will never see me, end the text with a block.''

Yeah, I'm not doing that, I'm just like Brooke and I can't even afford a plane ticket to go see my online friend, obviously why would I do this to someone in the same situation as me? 

That's just as bad as telling a friend you've been with for a few years that suddenly got a life-long illness, lost the ability to afford to go see you, lost the ability to only afford living expenses and medical care ''then you will say, this isn't for me and goodbye.''

Yeah, what you're saying and telling that person while dumping them is that you cannot handle this.

Yeahh, you've deep problems holding an online friendship unless it's frequent meetups and you cannot be broke. 

If you do somehow and something might happen in real life where you might become too broke in your later-years of life, then our friendship that we had been going for a while now is meaningless is what I felt getting dumped and removed from past-friendships and connections.

Here are the other bands that I enjoy.

Tips for messaging me in chat requests if you're uinsure.

However, let's end this on a positive note. If you don't know how to start your chat requests because you're too shy then maybe you can tell me your favorite pizza topping and least favorite pizza topping?

Yeah, you can also tell me your favorite sandwich topping and least favorite pizza toppings? Yeah, you can even let me know your favorite 🎄 or New Year's dish and even your favorite seasonal dish.

How do you enjoy your coffee? Favorite type of pasta dish, favorite energy drink and snacks when video gaming?

Yeah, for me I normally get Mcdonald's iced French vanilla coffee or caramel iced coffee twice a week. Starbucks I'd sometimes only buy something from Starbucks every week and a half or two because it's pricey because I love to have the iced teas and a nice VERY sweet frappe with one of their sandwiches.

Coffee at the house?

No, not often unless instant and I will be brewing a nice caffeine or caffeine tea every single day.

If that doesn't work you can let me know what games you're looking forward to next year in 2026 and what game you're currently playing right now.

Just let me know your favorite hobbies, interests and you can even give me a mini-bio packed of what you're into right now and you don't have to worry about being basic. Yeah, as long as you don't say hi/hello then you're fine.

Yeah, let's just text about life, your hobbies, interests, I want to know what makes you happy and just as much as I'm happy when you tickle my Vessel brain. Yeah, I'm looking forward to messaging you and if you're in your 20s, that's fine.",2,1766904354.0,u_Competitive_Creme510,0,1.0,False

I’m currently using a Senseo machine. It’s fine for regular coffee, but I want to take a small step further without spending a lot yet.

I’m considering a Nespresso or L’or pod machine Or a budget espresso machine (~€100)

A few questions:
1. Are pods (Nespresso/L’or) actually a noticeable upgrade over Senseo in terms of taste? Considering that they use 19bar of pressure, while the Deseo has none. 

2. I’m not ready to invest hundreds yet—I mainly want to explore different coffee styles and see what I like. So are the pod machines good for that?

3. Reusable pods appeal to me so I can try different beans without committing to expensive pods.
I also found a Create machine that supports Nespresso pods, Dolce Gusto pods, and ground coffee. Curious if anyone has experience with these hybrid machines and whether the quality holds up?

i'd love some feedback from you all

long story short: i got involved with a (at the time) co-worker of mine who's in a long distance relationship. she's bored with her boyfriend, wanted to open her relationship to date me, but we ended up fooling around a couple of times before that. things got messy, with a lot of back and forth especially from me, and we stepped back from the sexual/romantic fling

we kept things friendly since we were part of the same group of colleagues/friends, but she'd always hint at something romantic when i was moving on

she finally got a job in another city, so i quietly moved on and left her behind until a few weeks ago. she texted our group chat asking for our thanksgiving plans bc she'd visit out town. i already had something, so said so. then, she announced she'd be here two weeks prior to that - and i scheduled a trip to another state to avoid bumping into her. i liked the message in the chat and didn't say anything

fast forward to the week of her visit. she directly texts me, saying to ""let her know if i would like to meet for coffee or just hangout with our friends."" i told her i wouldn't be around in the weekend, but wished her lots of fun and next time i'd join. this was \*\*wednesday around 3pm\*\*

next day, \*\*thursday at 11am\*\*, she texts the group again, saying: ""hey all, plans changed and i arrived in town earlier. i canceled my class (she's a professor) and will be here from today until sunday x"" man, i swear i felt in my gut she came earlier to try to see me... i didn't even open the message, and decided to cut her off after this

lo and behold, when i'm leaving the building i was working that day, who i see at the stairs? yeah that woman... with her past coordinator and a random girl. i briefly stopped by, greeted everyone, and ran away as if my life depended on it

didn't open the group chat and of course she directly texted me on monday after my silence. she was upset at how weird was bumping into each other at work and how sad she was because she couldn't keep in touch with me and another colleague (both of us didn't reply to the group chat). she asked if everything was all right between us. after thinking about it, i said our fling was toxic as hell and that i'd step back from our connection. but wished her well and hoped she understand

she blamed me for being hot & cold, and wish me well too. then, i blocked her and left the group chat

am i the asshole?",1,1766903426.0,FearfulAvoidants,0,1.0,False
1pxkf20,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxkf20,"Lasting progress is made by taking one step at a time, not by trying to accomplish all your goals in one day.","Your health and well-being are worth investing in since your body is your primary home.

• Sit down and write down the goals {health wise} you want to accomplish.
• Include the real reason why you want to accomplish these goals {having more energy or better range of body movement are both excellent reasons}.
• Determine what your body is capable of doing today and focus on being consistent with following through on that for seven days.
• Set a new small but reachable goal for day eight. This may be as simple as holding out 5-10 seconds longer on a certain exercise movement. Be realistic, because unrealistic goals are disheartening and eats up your self-determination to work towards your goals.
• Block out time EVERY DAY to focus on your well-being. Start with 10 minutes if that's all you have time for.
• Drink water {I always recommend a minimum of 250ml p/10kgs of body weight}. Your body is 70% water and requires replenishment throughout the day. Feeling thirsty doesn't call for coffee, soft drinks, tea, etc, it calls for water.
• Invest in one item to get you started. This can be one outfit of activewear, an exercise mat, a set of dumbbells, a kettlebell, an exercise ball. Whatever type of exercise you're looking into, invest in a single item to get you started. Follow through with your routine for a month and invest in one more item next month.
• Praise yourself for doing good! Nobody will praise you for taking care of yourself at the start. You have to praise yourself, DAILY. Encourage yourself and remind yourself that you're worth taking care of.
• Reward yourself for reaching your goals. Set goals that are within your reach and reward yourself for reaching those goals with small self-care items. My rewards look like a new bottle of nail polish, a face / sheet mask that will hydrate my skin, cuticle oil, a good hand moisturizer, a slightly more expensive lip balm, a new pair of grippy socks. Bigger goals that are reached after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of consistency deserve bigger rewards.
• Do this for YOU. Invest in yourself, your health, your well-being, for you. This isn't about what others think and say, this about how healthy and mobile you are. This is about liking the person you see in the mirror again.",1,1766903378.0,u_EloquentReader,0,1.0,False

Location: Northern British Columbia (Canada)

Date and time  dec 26 3:34am

On this early morning after Christmas 
I (Complainant/victim)
Had been laying down to go to bed at my father‘s house  “ technically grandmother’s”
After Christmas day
Resting

(Backing up in the timeline)

My stepmother had invited her friends to come over and drink a little bit and play 31 (card game)
While playing my father went through have a bottle of Polish vodka and a Sapporo (Japanese beer)

And my stepmother had went through an entire bottle of vodka

After this event, I stepmother decided to drive home, her friends 
(mother and daughter)
To their home

Keep in mind, my stepmother had been incredibly intoxicated and it definitely over the legal limit to drive. Even after all that she took my two-year-old sister with them.

It was also a winter storm outside blowing
79km/h = 49.1m/h and that is including heavy snow 
At least 18-27cm thick
=
At least 7.1-10.6in thick
Which mind you isn’t easy to track through and could be a hazard with driving through unploughed roads

My father came upstairs upset, looking out the window, visibly intoxicated, swearing under his breath about Star driving in the conditions and driving  intoxicated

When my stepmother came home with my sister (2 year old)
They all went downstairs and started yelling back-and-forth. My father was saying how incredibly stupid it was and my mother saying it was just a small drive.

Well, all this is happening
My little sister was screaming and crying in front of the fight, I can hear it in the background.

I had called my mom because I was also visibly and mentally shook
(I’m 15 and had not been intoxicated, unlike others)

And I was crying that I wanted a way out of the remote community
(on the way in or out is by boat or seaplane )

Somehow, my father had caught wind that I was talking to someone and my father was texting me the go downstairs immediately

I told him NO

He said if I don’t go downstairs immediately, it would be worse if he came up

I told him if he comes up and lays a finger on me I would be contacting the POLICE 

He told me there was no police in town
(my father lives in a remote community where police aren’t always around)

I told him I didn’t care and that I would still be contacting 911

He came up and started yelling at me, which I yelled back, 

which prompted him to go around the coffee table near where I was sitting and then push me and grab my arms to lock me down, and that I had to punch him to get out of the hold he had me in.

I had quickly pushed at the coffee table out of the way and beginning, run downstairs and out the front door without shoes on
(this was all in front of my stepmother and sister)

He came out yell at me saying that I was lying to the police and that I should go back inside that I was in a lot of trouble

During this time, the police redirected the call to the local authorities that came in every couple weeks to patrol

And they said to calm down and distance myself from my step parent and father

After this, I was on the phone with my mother and was recording the phone call just in case anything happens to me

My stepmother yelling at me about the past issues and that I always lie to everyone
I yelled back to step away from me and do not touch me and to move away

She began yelling, even louder to me
After that, she grabbed my collar of my shirt and again tugging at me to go back inside
(which was almost choking me out)
I had to slam the corner of my phone 
Into her right upper forehead to let me go
After that, she said I would be going to jail 
for a long time for hitting her 

I went inside to grab my shoes because I have nothing on my feet
My stepmother was standing next to the door, holding the door handle and telling me to come in and grab my shoes!

Which I denied
Seeing how she was right next to the door and could trap me in

I told her to move up the stairs, cause I didn’t feel safe around here which she did not do and would stand there next to the door, holding it and telling me to come in and grab my shoes
After multiple attempts to tell her to move upstairs, she moved up a singular stair


And I had to repeatedly ask for her to move up the stairs and to the upper landing (which took multiple attempts to ask)

Which I grabbed my shoes and went downstairs out to the driveway
They close the door and had minimal contact with me after that
I was standing in the driveway with nothing but a dress T-shirt
And some dress shorts
And some brown loafers

I was standing there talking to the local police over the phone as I had them all the time with my mother and 911

They advised me go to the local health centre
Because I told them I didn’t know anyone else in the area that wasn’t already friends with my dad

I was forgetting to walk down the driveway when a drunk man came out of nowhere yelling
About the fight outside that just happened
Saying that he could hear it down the block

He was holding a knife
(most importantly, a switchblade)

Saying that if I I didn’t close my mouth and shut up, he would come back up or kill me

Which I complied and said that I wouldn’t talk
I made two comments to defend myself
1
“I have a knife stay back”
2
“ the police are coming they will shoot you”

I already searched up on number one
And I’m within the legal right to make that comment in a life-threatening situation
(keep in mind I had nothing but the phone on me and the clothes on my back)

He walked away and said merry Christmas. I got back on the phone with my mother
And began silently breaking apart, saying that there’s a drunk man down the road with a knife
During all this, my mother‘s boyfriend was on the phone with the police giving them updates

I began hiking my way to the health clinic
(I say hiking because it was very hard to get there in the condition the roads were in)

When I got there, they let me in, locked the doors and began treating me for mild hypothermia

After a lot of communication with social services

And the first nations authority
“NIFCIS”
And the police and firefighters to find a way to the ferry off the community
Which took about three-ish hours of back-and-forth before being able to secure a way home

( the reason why the police couldn’t come any faster because the conditions both at the community and at the closest city where a poor and they would have to take a three hour boat ride into the community and then a half an hour police car ride into the community

They said it would be likely impossible to get there within eight hours which was Ludacris in my mind as if this had gotten anything worse I would not have been helped for a long time

I got some minimal things back when my father dropped some stuff off at the fire station

All it was was a backpack full of stuff that I already knew that was in it or around it

But I’m still missing Christmas gifts

A PlayStation five

Two controllers

Clothing

And Christmas money $100

And multiple emails have been put out from my mother to ask when I’m getting this back?

And nothing yet 

The police officer came to meet me in person
And he got their side of the end they told the officer that I pushed and shoved my stepmother

The police officer also said that he would not be
Pushing anything criminally


What do I do now?

My mother and me are going to victim services on Monday dec 29th
To get a restraining order or see what will happen

I don’t wanna push criminal charges against my father, but I want to push criminal charges against my stepmother

How will I do this and get my stuff back?

Was it legal to threaten in a life-threatening situation and to say the police are going to come shoot you?

How will the stand in court?

I was a minor in all of this (15)

I need legal advice, please on how to move forward!!!!

The café is realistic enough, but I’ve never been anywhere like it. Sometimes, characters from the dream come with me, and other times, I go alone. My dreams are usually intense and very, very weird, so the reprieve is definitely appreciated lol.

Every time, there’s new specials on the menu—last night’s was a caramel croissant and a sausage & egg sandwich—all of which I can taste in the dream. And damn, my brain is a good chef! My taste is as vivid as any of my other senses, down to the butteryness of the croissant or the thickness of the coffee (on nights where that’s offered). 

I’m well aware this sounds like bs, but it’s very much not. Other restaurants have been repeating recently as well. One of my other favorites is a beef ramen shop run by one of my online friends.",3,1766903130.0,Dreams,5,1.0,False

Started two years ago doing Instagram and Facebook management for local small businesses like gyms, salons, that kind of thing. First year was rough, made maybe $2K per month on average with like 6 clients churning constantly. Felt like I was always hustling for the next client just to replace ones who left. My biggest problem was I had no system for getting new clients. Would post occasionally in local Facebook groups, tried running some Facebook ads that burned $400 with zero results, would ask friends if they knew anyone. Super inconsistent, feast or famine. Some months I'd land 3 new clients, other months nothing. The stress was killing me. Had coffee with another service business owner in September last year, she ran a bookkeeping service. Asked how she gets clients and she said about 80% come from referrals from existing clients. She literally just asks every client after 3 months if they know anyone else who might need bookkeeping help, sends them a simple email template. Said she gets maybe a 40% response rate with actual referrals. Felt so obvious but I'd never actually done it systematically.

Started doing the same thing in October. After working with a client for 2-3 months once they're happy with results, I send a simple email saying I'm looking to work with 2-3 more businesses like theirs, do they know anyone who might need help. Include a little discount for them if the referral signs up. First month I sent that to 8 clients, got 3 referrals, closed 2 of them. Made it a monthly habit, every client who's been with me 60+ days gets that email. Response rate is probably around 35-40%, not everyone knows someone but enough do. Been doing this for about 14 months now, grew from $2K to $7.3K monthly revenue. Now have 19 active clients, lost maybe 4 in the past year but gaining more than I lose. About 70% of new clients in the past year came from referrals. Completely changed my business from constantly stressed about finding clients to actually having a waitlist. The simple system came from reading case studies in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) about service businesses that scaled through referrals instead of ads. Made me realize I was overcomplicating it, just needed to ask existing happy clients consistently.",28,1766903107.0,smallbusiness,9,0.85,False

***Absolute immersion.*** *That’s what Phanterra World had promised. A virtual world so seamless, you could scarcely distinguish it from reality. It was meant to be Jack Christian’s escape to something better—to something more.*

*Instead, The Panic trapped him and millions of other players inside the game with no way out. Those deleted in World don’t respawn, and nobody knows if that means freedom or oblivion.*

*The chaos eventually settled into something worse: order.* 

*Powerful ""Levellords"" control the Respite Zones, charging desperate players “Subscriptions” for the privilege of safety. The Revenant's Heart guild rules Overworld with an iron fist, while Rogue Players and Field Enemies hunt the unprotected in the wilds of the open world.*

*Three years later, Jack—now BladereignX—has given up hope of ever seeing the real world again. He grinds to survive, trapped between guild politics, systems that turn survival into exploitation, and the soul-crushing question of whether deleted players are truly gone forever.*

*Does he keep his head down and hope the system doesn’t crush him? Or does he risk everything for a chance at something better? Something more?*

# Chapter #1: Welcome to Phanterra ORIGIN

*Anyone familiar with the rush of seeing their name atop an arcade leaderboard, or the frustration that precedes throwing a console controller against the wall, can attest to the visceral sensation video games can produce in a person, and understands that these experiences go beyond mere entertainment.* 

*While the body remains fixed within the tangible veracity of hard reality, the mind and heart traverse realms where imagination reigns supreme. Battlefields where loss has no sting, labyrinths that captivate rather than confound, and economies where success is guaranteed by foolproof patterns of persistence and progress. To any who have finessed a joystick or mastered the ways of QWERTY, these virtual realities have spawned experiences as formative as learning to ride a bike or tie one’s shoes. Many games are designed as reprieves—safe spaces where one can simply plug in and, for a short while, disengage from the often harsh mundanity of life.* 

*But the allure of these digital sanctuaries can sometimes turn oppressive. Places of refuge become cages as the tension between illusory liberation and the hobby’s inherently confining nature strengthens. What begins as an innocent grasping at freedom not readily attainable in everyday life, becomes a pathological snare of obligation and dependency—virtual prisons formed out of the very things we believed would offer us release*.

***2008***

Coffee and disinfectant. The principal’s office reeked of both because the assistant hated two things: kids and being awake. She’d been glowering at Jack through pink, dangly-chained glasses for the past ten minutes, and he was *beyond* ready to go. He should already be home, racing into his bedroom to fire up his GameTerminal. But there he was—there they all were—stuck. On a Friday of all days.

His tennis shoes squeaked against the polished floor as he fidgeted in an uncomfortable plastic chair, every so often, peeking at a clock that seemed to move slow on purpose. The tick-tock-tick-tock only magnified the awkwardness of Tommy DeLuca sniffling across the room, hunched in his chair, face half-hidden by hands that wiped wet eyes under messy blonde bangs.

Jack huffed and rolled his eyes. *Maybe if you could just take no for an answer...* 

Tommy hadn’t spent three whole months saving up to buy ***Phanterra***. Jack had mowed lawns, walked dogs, and passed up candy at the gas station so that every crumpled dollar could go toward the RPG video game now that it was back in stock again. *He* earned Phanterra, not Tommy. 

So how was saying ""get your own"" being a bully?

The principal's door swung open, and Jack shot to his feet. He rocked from one foot to the next, watching his father, but couldn’t hear much over the assistant’s phone conversation. Then, his dad and Mr. Deluca shook hands—and smiled. 

*Yes! I’m not in trouble!*

Jack turned, ready to bolt, but when his dad’s eyes found him, the smile vanished. His father crossed his dark, muscular arms, and Jack’s gaze snapped to the floor, to the scuff marks, to the baseboards, to anywhere but his father’s eyes.

""Come on.” His dad’s voice boomed in the tiny office. He didn’t *sound* mad, but Jack gulped and followed, already kissing his Friday night goodbye.

\*\*\*\*

Jack's stomach tightened with each mile home. He pressed his forehead against the cool window, sneaking glances at his father’s profile. His dad’s jaw was set, hands tight on the wheel of their old, dented Honda. Jack was grateful for the stay of execution, and in the silence, he gripped an invisible sword. A silent *sching* shaped his lips as he struck down an imagined Orc. He should be halfway through the Blackwood Forest now, not stuck in this car. 

Then his dad broke the silence. ""We need to talk.""

A sudden urge to use the bathroom made Jack’s stomach clench. ""Am I in trouble? I didn't even do anything! Tommy just—""

""I know. You're not in trouble, I just…” His father exhaled. “Why didn't you want to share your game with Tommy?""

Jack hesitated. Unlike his mom, when Jack’s dad said he wasn’t in trouble, he *usually* meant it. ""Because... I worked hard for it. Why should Tommy get to play when he didn't earn it?""

""Uh-huh. And did you say that to him?""

Jack looked at his lap. ""Yes, sir..."" 

The car turned past the Big Donuts sign. They'd be home soon—just not soon enough for this conversation to be over.

""The DeLucas are struggling, son.” His dad’s voice was heavier than before. “Mr. DeLuca hasn't been able to find work, so he's moving the family to North Carolina next week.""

Jack's head snapped up. That was a long way from California. ""Really?""

""It's the only place he could find work. Tommy's probably scared. Moving somewhere he's never been and leaving behind everything he knows? Maybe he just wanted to hang out with someone familiar one last time.""

Times were tough. Jack knew that. He'd seen his mom sigh at grocery receipts, heard his parents' hushed conversations about late rent. But he never imagined things were *that* bad. Bad enough that Tommy had to pack up and leave Umstead City for good. Jack covered up a sniffle, not wanting to look like a crybaby in front of his dad.

 ""You earned that game fair and square. I won't make you share it if you don't want to, but what do your mother and I always tell you?""

Jack swallowed hard. The family mantra had been memorized before he was out of kindergarten. “If I can’t help people, then at least I shouldn’t hurt them…” It hurt to say it out loud knowing how he’d treated Tommy.

His dad nodded. ""It's okay to want things for yourself, Jack. Just remember—we're all stuck in the same place together. The least we can do for each other is make it a place worth being stuck in."" Without another word, his dad switched on the radio and began bobbing his head to a T-Pain song like he hadn’t just turned Jack’s world upside down.

Jack slumped back against the seat. *Phanterra* wasn’t an excuse to be a jerk to anyone. Tommy deserved a real apology, not the half-hearted “sorry” he’d mumbled to get out of going to the principal’s office. For the first time in his life, Jack actually wanted to go back to school. On a Friday, no less.

\*\*\*\*

Jack's breath formed silver puffs in the cool Saturday morning air as he rushed down the cracked sidewalk, video games clutched against his chest. His heart hammered. 

*Phanterra! Finally!*

He sidestepped the homeless man dozing against the brick wall and slid through GamePad’s automatic doors. The familiar sing-songy chime welcomed him into a wonderland brimming with rows of games gleaming under fluorescent lights. His flushed, russet cheeks stretched wide at the sight: life-size cardboard cutouts of Captain Commander from the *Corona* franchise and Tie from the *Legend of Zelara*. Demo stations hummed with the latest games, but Jack barely glanced at them. His gaze locked onto the massive banner hanging from the ceiling:

**PHANTERRA. EVERY ADVENTURE FOR EVERYONE.**

A squeal slipped out before he could stop it.

""Welcome to GamePad!"" An auburn-haired employee grinned at him. ""Here to trade those in? My buddy at the counter will hook you up!""

Jack sprinted to the register where a bored-looking, shabbily dressed cashier clicked mechanically at the computer. He heaved his collection onto the counter with his biggest—cutest—smile. “How much can I get for these?”

The cashier sighed and started scanning the games. Jack shifted on his feet, watching the man, waiting. Every so often, the cashier picked up a game, examined it, then kept clicking. To a ten-year-old, it seemed he was taking all the time in the world. He was sacrificing games he loved—adventures that had filled countless rainy afternoons, worlds he’d explored for hundreds of hours. But *Phanterra* would be worth it. A month of mowing lawns and walking dogs had only earned him twenty-five of the $49.99 he needed. GamePad’s famous trade-in policy would cover the rest.

""Five dollars,"" the cashier said finally.

Jack's mouth fell open. ""Wait... what?""

“Five bucks.” The cashier reiterated, not a trace of humor in his voice. “That’s what we’ll give you.”

“You’re messing with me, right?! Twelve games for five dollars?! This is *Rules of Engagement: New Warfare*! I just got it last year!”

The cashier shrugged. “Sequel’s coming out soon. Which makes this one practically worthless for trade-ins.”

Jack gripped the counter’s edge, tempted to jump behind the computer and see if he was being lied to. “But—I’ve been saving for weeks to get *Phanterra*! I only need a little more!”

“Kid, all I’m telling you is what the computer is telling me. We just don’t need these titles.”

“Can you at least hold a copy for me while I get more money?” Jack pleaded.

“Sure, but holding it’ll cost ya ten bucks. Non-refundable. *Phanterra* is still very hard to get, and we’ve only got a handful of copies.”

“Ten dollars?!” Jack’s voice cracked. “That’s, like, half of what I got!”

The cashier was already retreating toward the back room. “It’s out of my hands, kid. Get more money, or find better games to bring in.”

Jack stood frozen, staring at his suddenly worthless collection. He hoped beyond hope that the cashier would return—remembering Jack’s *Dragon Knight Journey* was a super rare edition worth eleventy-billion dollars—but the back room remained quiet. He gathered up his games and left, the cheerful door chime now mocking him as he shuffled outside, his plan for a whole Saturday of gaming gone in the cool wind.

Jack didn’t see the homeless man until he was already tumbling over him. 

Games scattered across the dirty sidewalk as he landed in a flustered heap. “Sorry!” 

The man stirred, irritation flickering across his stubbled, hollowed cheeks, before softening into a smile. “No harm done, son,” he said, helping gather the scattered games. “I should find a better place to sleep, huh? It’s time for me to rustle up some breakfast anyway!”

Jack stared at the man’s clothing: the threadbare jacket, the carefully stitched patches, the sneakers more tape than shoe. He imagined what “breakfast” meant for this man and felt sick. 

“Thanks,” Jack mumbled as he started to leave.

Then his dad’s voice echoed in his mind, and his feet stopped. The crumpled bills in his pocket felt heavy now.

*Make it a place worth being stuck in.*

He’d worked so hard for this money, dreamed about Phanterra for so long. Did he actually want to do this, or was he just feeling bad for how he treated Tommy yesterday? 

Jack pulled the money out and turned back. “Go to Pancake House,” he said, pressing a ten-dollar bill into the man’s palm. “Their blueberry pancakes are the best!” 

The man’s eyes widened. “Son, I can’t—”

“I was just gonna waste it on something I don’t need anyway.” The honesty in his words surprised him.

“Blueberry pancakes, eh?” The man said, smiling. “Thank you, son. I’ll give ‘em a try.”

As Jack watched him shuffle away, he felt warmer in the cool morning. It didn’t erase the sting of being Phanterra-less, but it dulled the ache a bit.

A tap on GamePad’s window caught his attention: the auburn-haired employee was motioning him back inside. 

“That was pretty cool what you did out there,” the employee said as Jack stepped through the doors. 

“Thanks mister. My parents always say if I can’t help people, then at least I shouldn’t hurt them. Since I tripped over him…” Jack shrugged bashfully. 

The employee chuckled. “I like that! You were after *Phanterra*, right? Let me see those games.”

Jack handed them over, trying not to hope. The employee examined each case with genuine interest, so different from his colleague’s dismissive glances. “Yeahhhhh, none of these will get you *Phanterra*,” he said finally.

Jack deflated. “The other guy already told me that…”

“You really like RPGs, huh?”

“Are you kidding?!” The words exploded out of Jack. “They’re awesome! You can be anyone—a knight, a pirate, a wizard! You get to go on epic adventures to fight dragons and save kingdoms! You can just get lost inside one, and forget about bullies and missing rent, and—” He stopped, cheeks warming. 

The employee just nodded, and Jack was happy he didn’t pry. “Follow me,” he said. At the counter, he rummaged through the drawer before turning away, and Jack heard scratching sounds. When he turned back, he held out a plain game case labeled “Phanterra” and grinned. 

Jack’s breath caught. “Is this—?”

“Yep! A pre-owned copy, but it’s the real deal alright.” 

Jack’s smile faltered as he reached for his pocket—now ten dollars short. “Even if it’s used, I can’t afford it now…” 

The employee smiled. “Don’t worry about it. This is my personal copy. Borrow it, save up for your own, then bring it back. Deal?”

Jack examined where the pricing sticker and barcode was scratched off on the case. “I can’t just take it. My parents would kill me.”

“You’re not taking it—you’re borrowing it,” the employee corrected. “Think of it like a library book.”

“Thank you, but—”

The employee just patted his shoulder. “Welcome to Phanterra, kid. You’re in for the adventure of a lifetime.”

Jack clutched the game like a sacred artifact. He’d have done a cartwheel then and there if he wasn’t holding so many games. “I promise I’ll bring it back as soon as I buy my own! Thank you, Mister…?”

The employee tapped his name tag with a grin. “I’ve been Wyatt! And you are?”

“Jack! Jack Christian! You can call my parents if I’m not back here in a month!”

Wyatt laughed. “I’ll keep that in mind. Now go save some kingdoms!”

Jack burst out of the store, sprinting home faster than he’d ever run in his life. 

He exploded through the apartment door, startling his mom as she folded laundry on the couch. But when she saw what he was holding, she smiled. Jack’s other games clattered to the kitchen floor as he held up *Phanterra* with both hands like a trophy. 

“Mom! Can Tommy DeLuca come over and play it with me?!”

**Reach’s** meteoric rise transformed gaming culture. 

Before 2013, video game streaming was often dismissed as an idle pastime for the socially inept—an indulgence of unemployed men shuttered in their parents’ basements. Reach changed that. The streaming service provided a platform where the awkward and charismatic alike could cultivate massive audiences and elevate themselves to the status of digital celebrities.

The platform’s success coincided with the esports boom of the 2010s. Titles such as *Company of Champions, Rules of Engagement: Covert Ops*, and *Tado 2* fueled its expansion, transforming it into a multibillion-dollar enterprise. Yet no game became more synonymous with Reach than ***Phanterra Legend***, the MMORPG sequel to the original *Phanterra* game that once dominated the market. 

Set in the fictional realm of Phanterra, the game seamlessly blended medieval fantasy and modern aesthetics to create a world of enhanced humans, scientific weaponry, archaic magic, and mythical wonders. Highly immersive and suspiciously addictive, it garnered an average daily player count of one million, cementing its status as a cultural phenomenon.

***2015***

Jack’s fingers flew across the keyboard, each keystroke an expertly executed command as familiar as his own heartbeat. The monitor blazed with cascading likes, emojis, and donations as his avatar vaulted through Mt. Colossus, plasma-infused blade singing through digital air. The Big Grey Man towered before him on screen, a boss Jack had slain a hundred times over. His fingers acted on pure muscle memory—dodge, parry, strike—even on ""Sweat Mode"", the game’s most punishing difficulty. His chat exploded with praise. 

Then he saw the countdown timer, and a heaviness settled on his chest.

**Final Legend Stream: 00:00:37**.

Jack opened his mouth, but stopped. His voice was already on the verge of cracking, and if he said the wrong thing, it’d get damp inside his helmet real quick. ""The first time I fought this guy, I lost so many times I almost threw my controller across the room."" A laugh slipped out, catching in his throat. ""Then when Legend dropped… let's just say I learned replacement controllers ain't cheap.""

Three years building this—from nobody to half a million subscribers. The sleek black helmet concealing his face had become iconic, spawning fan art and merchandise that netted him a salary comparable to his parents’.

At his peak, Jack’s streams drew fifty thousand concurrent viewers, but that night, only a few dozen remained—his core community. The ones who’d been there since his follower count first ticked up. People he might even call friends if the great digital expanse of the internet wasn’t separating them.

Not that any of them really knew *Jack* *Christian*. The audience only knew the online persona he cultivated—the cyberpunk-meets-Arthurian knight who dominated *Phanterra Legend* with ice cold composure. **BladereignX** was the true icon, and he preferred it that way.

Southern California living meant celebrities lurked around every Starbucks, and he cringed thinking how every Tom, Dick, and Davonte acted like damn fools just to get a picture with one. If some random fan screamed his name at the grocery store, he’d likely run into traffic from embarrassment. Anonymity was a blessing, and he actually felt most like himself behind the helmet.

Unlike the countless online creators who trauma-dumped every personal detail for content, Jack maintained strict boundaries. Was it a complete lack of shame that drove them to be so ‘open’? Or some compulsive need to appear more relatable to their audiences? Jack hated wearing name tags purely for the fact someone would know his name before he could introduce himself, so he’d rather die than bare his soul to strangers—especially the 0.4% of his audience watching from Bosnia. 

He had nothing to hide, but wanted to keep 'who he was' and 'what they saw' separate all the same. As far as his half a million subscribers were concerned, he was just a talking head who was really good at playing *Phanterra Legend*.

A notification flashed across his monitor: **Umstead Electric: Past Due Balance**. 

Jack paused his game and paid it. His dad would be upset, but he could always play the *I need electricity to stream* card. At sixteen, with his first chin hairs finally coming in, he figured he was man enough to start pulling his weight.

He refocused, tracking every pixel through his helmet's visor. ""I wanted to end things here because… out of all the memories I've made in Phanterra, that was the one that mattered most. If I'd given up back then, I wouldn't be talking to all of you right now."" 

The helmet's anonymity couldn’t hide the slight crack in his voice. His chat erupted with heart emojis, bittersweet goodbyes, and longtime followers sharing their favorite BladereignX moments. Jack's chest tightened. Phanterra hadn't just been a game, it had been his lifeline, his path to helping his family through their hardest times.

He couldn’t let the mushy feelings get the best of him, though. It might damage the brand. ""Don't get sappy on me now,"" he said. ""Only 'GGs' in the chat."" He hesitated. ""After tonight, who knows if I'll ever touch a keyboard again? That's why I wanted to do this… one last playthrough with all of you.""

The timer hit zero.

""I really appreciate all of you. Let's meet again—or for real, I guess—in ***World***. Peace out.""

The screens went dark. Jack leaned back in his gaming chair, leather creaking in the sudden silence. Slowly, he unfastened the helmet that had been his face for three years. His cloudy, black hair tumbled free, and cool air kissed his skin for the first time in hours. His eyes were watery, but he chalked it up to perspiration.

Walking to his nightstand on unsteady legs, Jack reached for the small white box that had arrived yesterday. The CySon Games logo was embossed in silver—three hands grasping a joystick to form an awkward 'Y'. He opened it, and nestled in plush velvet lay his **World Key**.

The device was beautiful, obsidian black with neon-purple accents and gold lettering which read: ***Phanterra World***. Jack's reflection shimmered on its polished surface.

“Holy shit,” he whispered, turning the device over in his hands. His head swirled from the surrealness of the moment. A thumbprint scan unlocked the Key, and it hummed to life, filling the room with a luminous, synthetic voice.

**{Hello, BladereignX. Welcome to Phanterra World. Before beginning your adventure, please take this World Key to your local CySon Gaming Lounge for calibration. Would you like to view and customize your Avatar** 

**Profile? Y/N?}**

""Yes.” He spoke into the device, and his bedroom exploded with greenish-white light as a holographic projection materialized. His avatar's stats hung in the air like glowing scripture:

**{BladereignX}** 

**Job Class: Adventurer** 

**Player Rank: 50** 

**Race: Mankind** 

**Title: The Light-Hearted**

**Health (HP): 2,600/2,600** 

**Stamina (STP): 2,000/2,000** 

**Strength (AP): 500** 

**Defense (DP): 200** 

**Speed (SP): 450** 

**Intelligence (IP): 110** 

**Senses (SNP): 130** 

**Stock (SKP): 100 slots** 

**Charisma (CP): 100** 

**Luck (LUP): 90**

Jack stared at the numbers representing three years of his life. Every late night grind session, every perfectly executed combo, and every moment of triumph and frustration. ""Delete everything except avatar appearance and Core Knowledge database.""

**{This action is irreversible. Confirm? Y/N?}**

His finger hovered over the confirmation. It felt like tearing down a house he’d built brick by brick. Three years of progress, gone with a single command. But as he pressed ‘Y’, the regret faded into anticipation. The numbers vanished, leaving only the avatar’s visual design floating in the air: himself but with silver locs braided back neatly, draped in a heavy cloak with a longsword slung over his back. A fresh start wrapped in familiar skin. 

Jack powered down the Key and cradled it against his chest. 

""Phanterra,"" he murmured. His pulse quickened. ""Here I come.""

\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\*

In October 1958, Physicist William Higinbotham unveiled *Tennis for Two* on an oscilloscope, which is widely credited as the first video game designed solely for entertainment. That modest experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory hinted at the revolutionary potential of interactive digital experiences.

Sixty years later, ***Phanterra World*** reached the peak of digital interactivity.

To call the latest Phanterra installment “revolutionary” would be an understatement to some—and a dangerous mischaracterization to others. Within five months of launch, governments worldwide scrambled to draft emergency laws, desperate to contain its spread or shut it down entirely. Was this the pinnacle of human achievement, or a crisis unlike any the world had seen?

Students abandoned education, employees forsook careers, and families disintegrated as individuals immersed themselves for weeks on end. Businesses shuttered as workers withdrew from reality. Even instances of violent behavior at CySon gaming lounges weren't uncommon, with many individuals so desperate for their chance to be a part of *World*, they became dangerous.

The world stood at a precipice. What began as a marvel of technology had morphed into a societal dirty bomb, made possible by the collaboration of two men.

\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\*

Bo Stafford adjusted his pinstripe tie in the dressing room mirror, fluorescent bulbs casting harsh light across his angular features. His reflection showed a man who'd built an empire and was watching it crumble under public scrutiny. He tousled his platinum blonde hair, but the exhaustion beneath his deep-set brown eyes remained. Even his on-call esthetician couldn't erase what months of congressional hearings and sleepless nights had done.

Damage control for *Phanterra World*’s minor hiccups was simple enough, but having to justify something the world should be openly embracing was grinding him down. Still, he'd endure another seven weeks of Senate committees before willingly subjecting himself to another interview with Khloe Khouri, the *Now Morning Show*'s most ruthless anchor.

""She's going to test me,"" he muttered.

**{Adhere to the script provided by the board, and everything will proceed smoothly.}**

The A.I. voice in his mind was gentle, like a mother assuring her child. An unsettling evolution from the cold efficiency he'd originally programmed. He should have disabled the personality subroutines months ago, but something about **E**'s emergent tenderness had become oddly comforting.

""Show me the talking points again.""

**{Of course, Mr. Stafford.}**

A holographic display shimmered before his eyes. Legal had sanitized every word, scrubbing away every jot and tittle that might further damn the fate of his beloved project in the ongoing hearings. He memorized the sterile phrases before a sharp knock interrupted.

""Mr. Stafford? We're ready for you.""

He straightened his tie and forced his shoulders back. ""Wish me luck, E. It’s not ideal that Phanterra’s fate is resting on a daytime television rag, but here we go.""

**{Good luck, Mr. Stafford.}**

\*\*\*\*

By the first commercial break, Bo was calculating the distance to the nearest exit. As CEO of America's largest gaming company, he was no slouch at getting answers out of people, but he'd met a terrifying equal in Khloe Khouri. She was relentless, lobbing razor-sharp questions that dissected his responses with surgical precision, and not a single softball in the mix. He watched her signature brown power bob sway with infuriating rhythm as she dismantled his talking points like a seasoned prosecutor. Her skill would've been better suited for war crimes tribunals than morning television.

""Back on the air in five, four, three, two…""

Khouri turned to camera three, perfectly composed despite having just eviscerated a Fortune 500 CEO. ""Welcome back, America. We're here with CySon Games CEO Bo Stafford discussing *Phanterra World*—the virtual reality phenomenon that has redefined the boundary between reality and fiction. Mr. Stafford, thank you again for joining us.”

“A pleasure,” Bo replied smoothly. 

It absolutely wasn’t.

“Before the break, we discussed Dr. John Ingram, your biotechnological engineer who spearheaded the development of the **Cyber-Physio Vortex Engine**. Many consider him the true architect of this global sensation—the Wozniak to your Steve Jobs. Some would even hold him singularly responsible for the crisis we now face. Your response?""

A slight smile tugged at Bo’s lips. A lesser man would recoil from such a blatant jab at his ego. ""'Colleague' undersells our relationship. Dr. Ingram is one of my dearest friends and a true visionary. Those attempting to smear his name as some 'mad scientist' clearly don't know the man. There isn't a heart more inclined to the greater good than his.""

Khouri's eyebrow arched, like the hammer on a gun. ""The greater good? Surely you're not suggesting the catastrophic impact your game has had reflects Dr. Ingram's intentions for the ‘greater good’? Consider Mary Smith: a Midwest single mother who hasn't heard from her daughter Mackenzie in five months. The young woman abandoned a full ride to UC Berkeley to remain trapped in your illusory world.""

Bo kept his smile through sheer force of will. “The unintended consequences of the CPV-Engine’s release concern us deeply. Because of this, we’ll be implementing comprehensive safeguards: playtime caps for all participants, and on-site addiction specialists at every CySon Lounge globally.""

Bo straightened. The board's boring damage control spiel was out of the way. He leaned forward, his true rebuttal already loaded. ""But I ask you, how is this different from any cultural phenomenon? Remember planking? People lost jobs over a social media trend. Are incidents like the Smith family alarming? Absolutely. Cause for mass hysteria? Hardly, Khloe.""

She pounced. ""Forgive me, but a niche internet fad is a far cry from your game's monumental influence. *Phanterra World* launched with two million players—an industry record—and its concurrent daily player count has remained roughly the same. Next week's server expansion could quadruple that number. That's *eight million* potential Mackenzie Smiths abandoning reality for a children's game that costs just five hundred dollars to access.""

The phrase struck like a haymaker. Bo’s carefully constructed facade wavered, and Khouri’s eyes gleamed with predatory satisfaction. She’d found the chink in his armor.

*A children's game?* 

He'd poured his entire soul into *World*, sacrificing relationships, health, and sanity to build something transcendent. It was his *baby*. His sole attempt to leave behind a legacy for someone other than the fat-pocketed shareholders on the board. And this woman compared it to tic-tac-toe.

**{Warning: You are about to deviate from the prepared statement.}**

Bo dismissed E's holographic warning and leaned forward, his voice dropping to an almost sinister whisper. ""A children's game? With all due respect Khloe, that's like calling the polio vaccine cough medicine.""

The studio fell impossibly silent, as if everyone present had leaned forward in unison.

""Despite possessing one of this era's greatest minds, John Ingram is humble to a fault. He'd only praise the humanitarian potential of his creations, but never the creation itself—so I will. The CPV-Engine represents humanity's *greatest* technological achievement. The wheel, the printing press, electricity, the internet—they'll all pale in comparison once this technology reaches its full potential.""

Bo's voice gained strength as an old fire kindled in his chest. ""This engine doesn't just blur the lines between reality and virtual reality—it erases them entirely. What we've created is a testing ground for ***absolute immersion***, a place where people can escape their troubles. So no, Khloe, *Phanterra World* isn't 'just a game'.""

Khloe leaned closer, challenging his resolve. ""But isn't that precisely the problem? An ‘escape’ from reality? Shouldn't people face their problems instead of running from them?""

""And how can they face problems when they lack what's necessary to overcome them?"" Bo shot back.

""Which is?""

""Hope."" The word escaped as barely more than a whisper as a melancholy smile touched his lips. ""I believe we lost hope from our collective consciousness years ago. The expectation that something more—that something *better*—lies ahead. *That’s* what I wish to return to our world through *World*.""

""So you're selling dreams, Mr. Stafford? Encouraging people to invest in something that ultimately isn't real feels… dangerous to me.""

""Hopelessness is dangerous. What do people have to look forward to today? Stagnant wages? Crushing debt? Retirement, homeownership, higher education—the recession turned these into distant fantasies for millions. *Phanterra World* offers something genuine: a place where, even for a moment, people can forget their burdens and *just be*.""

Khouri regarded him, appearing to study his conviction. ""And you truly believe that?""

Bo met her gaze without flinching. ""Don't you *want* to believe that, Khloe?”

The day after the last day of school was perfect. Nothing but endless California sunshine under a cloudless azure sky, the kind of weather that made Umstead City almost forget it was the poor man's Los Angeles. Jack had arrived five hours ago at the crack of dawn, convinced he'd beat the rush.

He *wasn't* the only genius with that plan.

Outside the gaming lounge attached to CySon HQ, the crowd stretched endlessly, like all three million of the city’s residents were waiting to enter *Phanterra World*. The line wrapped around the massive steel-and-glass building three times, a serpentine mass of humanity corralled by neon orange traffic cones and overwhelmed security guards.

Jack shifted his weight from foot to foot. His russet skin glistened with sweat, and his black curls were already damp despite the morning hour. Apart from the endurance that came with being a sixteen-year-old cross-country runner, the only thing that kept him upright was the electrifying reality that in a few hours, he'd finally be inside Phanterra.

The same goosebumps from when he'd first held the original Phanterra prickled his arms. It wasn't just a game anymore—it was real. A world of boundless adventure, suffused with magic, where his circumstances were his to control. A world he’d dreamed of being a part of since he was a kid. Through something he could scarcely believe *wasn’t* magic, CySon had created an experience unlike anything: a virtual reality so immersive, so seamless, it was almost indistinguishable from reality.

How long had he been grinning like an idiot? His eyes darted around to see if anyone was looking at him like he was crazy. Such a random judgy person would be the odd man out since he wasn’t the only one in line on the verge of busting. 

Would-be bards strummed acoustic guitars, their improvised songs about dragon slaying spreading through the line like wildfire. Nerds in vintage gaming T-shirts debated obscure lore with the same intensity as sports fans arguing playoffs. Middle-aged women compared character builds as they sipped iced coffee. Even some elderly folks had claimed spots. Jack chuckled, imagining some octogenarian named Ethel wheeling herself up to CySon HQ to become a dragon-slaying elf.

A group of Phanterra fanboys nearby debated a Level 3 secret passage. Jack bit his tongue. *Actually, there’s a third entrance most people miss…* He reined in his inner geek like Dr. Jekyll with Mr. Hyde to refrain from chiming in. His stomach rumbled, reminding him he’d skipped breakfast in his rush to arrive early. The smell of food trucks—Korean BBQ, gourmet grilled cheese, artisanal donuts—made his mouth water, but he didn’t dare lose his place.

He pulled out his World Key, the obsidian device warm in his palm. It pulsed gently as it powered on and displayed his avatar profile. He stared at the empty stats and missing titles. Was starting fresh the right choice? Carrying over his progress from *Legend* would make it a breeze to catch up to the millions of players who'd been online for months. The moment he stepped into Phanterra, he would be BladereignX again, one of the few to hit ninety-nine percent completion. The legendary knight who saved the kingdom of Ecthellon from the Dread Dragon Midoar.

Jack pushed the nostalgia away. That's not what he wanted. What he wanted was to experience this game—to experience Phanterra—right from the beginning. Not through a keyboard or controller, but with his own two hands, he wanted to battle the Feral-Minded Orcs of Blackwood and scale Mt. Colossus.

The line inched forward. Jack’s legs protested, his lower back ached, but his anticipation only grew. Only the mandatory two-hour daily playtime limit dampened his excitement. It was hardly enough time for serious exploration, let alone streaming content. But without those restrictions, his mother would never let him play. An avid consumer of daytime television, she’d nearly had a coronary watching the CySon CEO’s disastrous TV interview, and she became convinced the game was digital heroin designed to destroy young minds.

The glass doors came into view, maybe fifty people ahead now. Jack bounced on his toes. He was so close he could taste it.

Then something changed.

The excited chatter around him shifted to confused murmurs. People ahead were backing away from the entrance, faces alarmed. Jack craned his neck. His mom had drilled stories about fights at other gaming lounges into his head, but this was different. The perfectly organized line fractured, and a chaotic assemblage of panicked faces suddenly turned his way. CySon's doors flew open, and all hell broke loose.

No one was trying to get in anymore… they were trying to get out.

Jack spun his Black ass around and ran, not knowing or caring what was happening behind him. It didn't matter. He just had to get away. 

Then a woman's cry cut through the chaos. He spotted her on the ground, her dark skin bloodied, caught in the mob's path. Without thinking, he dove down, fighting against the current of bodies to haul her to safety. She was conscious but dazed, and her eyes were wild as she looked past him.

""Run… "" The woman limped into the flowing tide of people without another word. 

Jack looked back at the CySon building and his breath stopped.

A mass of churning darkness crowned the structure like a malevolent storm cloud. The air around it writhed and buckled, bending like crushed plastic. It felt wrong. Like some violation of reality he shouldn’t be seeing. The smell of ozone and burning electronics filled his nostrils. Heat singed the fine hairs on his arms as an invisible force pulled his body where it didn't want to go. Then came an onrush of darkness.

His parents' faces flashed through his mind. His father's reluctant but proud smile when Jack had offered to pay the electric bill, his mother's gentle hands adjusting his tie for junior prom. He clung to those memories, to their faces, but they slipped away as the darkness swallowed everything.

For what could have been moments, hours, or even days, Jack simply floated—aware and unaware at the same time. His body started to dissolve at the fingertips. No pain, just the horrifying sensation of watching himself unravel. First his hands, then his arms, then everything. The fragments of his consciousness melted into blackness.

The last thing he saw was his own reflection shattering into infinite pieces before—

**{Hello, BladereignX! Welcome to Phanterra!}**
