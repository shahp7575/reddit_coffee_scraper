1mt17hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1mt17hl/recruiter_opinion_about_genz/,Recruiter opinion about gen-z,"Hi everyone!
I wanted to share my mother’s opinion on hiring gen-z. My mother is a vice director of HR department in big Polish corporation. I was on a dinner with her with my wife and we were talking about how no one really wants to give a chance to gen-z. The conversation started with my wife saying that all of her friends from her country had to give up on being Graphic Designers cause literally no one wants to give them a chance if they don’t have any proven commercial experience. Same thing happened to her when she moved to Poland, hundreds of job applications and barely any response. It is true that graphic design department is currently not in the best condition but the whole point is not about that.

I mentioned to my mom that I saw some reports that young people have big and growing unemployment rates around whole Europe. She said that “well if I would have a choice between 30 vs 25 years old employee I would pick the older one cause new generation leaves office after 8 hours”. I was kind of shocked to hear that because I always thought that she is an exception in HR departments, but seems that I was wrong.

I asked her to elaborate on that. And asked her to confirm that if she would not know me, and she would see my resume of a software developer that has 7 years of experience in one of the biggest companies in the world, fluent in many technologies and 3 different languages she would pick someone who has 13 years of experience just because this someone works longer? She confirmed that she would hire the older one.

I mean wtf, so just because in general young people want to have the work-life balance we are already worse employees!? Personally I would absolutely disagree to stay longer in work for free constantly every day but I was always ok to do some additional hours if I could and there was a big need for it. However I stopped doing that because my company started cutting funds on raises and bonuses, instead every single kitchen in company needs to have gigantic double door refrigerators with ice machines, super expensive coffee machines, PS5 in every chillout room and let’s not forget about basket of fruits every single Tuesday. In my opinion they can shove all of these “benefits”! If they would pay me properly for my experience then I would buy myself fruits or coffee.

Saying that new generation just simply leaves after exactly 8 hours is like saying that all the Turks know how to make kebab or that every Asian is good with math. It’s clear discrimination based on age! So to any gen-z that are searching for work and are unable to find it I really feel bad for you and I hope someone eventually will give you the chance that you deserve.

In terms of my wife’s situation we were planning for some time to make our own business to give her some experience starting point. But after today I am really going to make this idea happen. My wife is already doing an amazing job by using her Graphic Design skills and started also with Software Development with a small mentorship from my side. I will literally use all my experience and knowledge to make this idea work so if the company will grow we will happily hire someone who never got a chance. I am not afraid to do the recruitment myself, already did it a lot and every single person that I chose was an absolute success. So let’s hope this idea will work and at least we’ll be able to help out some people. As for my mom she reminded me to have 0 trust for HR recruiters. Never in my life I met a good one

1mt126s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Lost-Manner5574/comments/1mt126s/why_las_vegas_business_owners_will_want_to/,Why Las Vegas Business Owners Will Want to Combine Digital PR with Reputation Management Strategies,"Hey, fellow Vegas hustlers!   
  
If you're slinging tacos on the Strip or running a cozy spa downtown, you know this city's all about that sparkle. But with the **2025 tourism dip**—folks staying away 'cause of high prices and that ""ghost town"" vibe on social media—keeping your online game strong is non-negotiable. I'm talking blending digital PR (that's sharing your cool stories online) with **online reputation management** (fixing or burying the bad stuff). Let's chat about why this combo is a must, why slacking off can bite you hard, and how one lousy review or article can drain your wallet big time. We'll keep it real, like we're grabbing drinks at a dive bar, with some eye-opening examples thrown in.

# What's the Deal with Mixing Digital PR and Online Rep Management Anyway?

**Picture this:** Digital PR is your hype squad—posting fun TikToks about your happy hour deals or getting a shoutout from a local influencer to show off your vibe. Online rep management? That's the cleanup crew, monitoring reviews on Yelp or Google and pushing down negative junk so it doesn't haunt your search results. Together, they're like peanut butter and jelly for your biz in Vegas. With visitor numbers tanking (down 11.3% in June, that's 400,000 fewer peeps!), you need to actively build trust and buzz. This combo keeps you visible and lovable, turning scrollers into customers. Without it, you're just hoping the neon lights do the work—and spoiler, they won't in this economy.

# Why Does This Stuff Need to Be Ongoing, Not Just a One-and-Done?

Vegas doesn't sleep, and neither does the internet. Trends shift fast— one week it's all about budget eats, the next it's eco-friendly spots. Ongoing means you're always posting fresh content, responding to reviews, and tweaking your online story to match what's hot. If you set it up once and forget, old bad vibes creep back up in searches, or new drama hits without you noticing. Experts say consistent effort can boost your rep by dominating Google results with positives, leading to more foot traffic and sales. In a city where 22% of jobs ride on tourism, slacking means missing out on the rebound when events like F1 races kick in. It's like watering a plant—you gotta keep at it, or it withers.

# Okay, What Kinda Harm Comes from Not Being Proactive? Gimme Examples.

**Not staying on it?** Oof, that's when the hurt rolls in. Take fake reviews—they're rampant and cost U.S. businesses a whopping $152 billion a year in lost trust and sales. In Vegas, imagine your restaurant gets slammed with bogus one-stars saying ""overpriced slop"" during the slump. Without proactive monitoring, those stick, scaring off tourists already wary of high costs. Real example: A local behavioral health spot in North Las Vegas saw one negative review deter potential clients, tanking bookings 'cause folks rely on online vibes for sensitive stuff. Or think cyber attacks—hackers leak data, and boom, your rep's trashed, leading to lawsuits and boycotts. Businesses ignoring this see sales drop, staff morale tank, and competitors swoop in. One Vegas opinion piece called the city ""not fun on a budget,"" and without counter-PR, that narrative spreads, hurting everyone from hotels to shops. Bottom line: No proactivity means you're reacting to fires, not preventing 'em, and that costs time, money, and sanity.

# How Can Just One Negative Link, Article, or Review Cost Thousands of Bucks?

**Alright, let's get real—**one bad apple can spoil the bunch big time. Say a disgruntled customer drops a scathing Yelp review about ""rude service"" at your bar. Studies show 93% of folks let reviews sway their buys, so that one post could chase away dozens of customers. Crunch the numbers: If your average customer spends $50, and you lose 30 potentials a month? That's $1,500 gone, easy—and over a year, we're talking $18,000+. But it snowballs: Google picks it up, it ranks high, and your bookings dip further. A negative news article? Even worse. In Vegas, an opinion piece bashing budget-unfriendly spots went viral, indirectly hurting tourism-reliant biz like yours. Fixing it later costs a fortune—Some reputation pros charge $500-2,500/month to suppress and rebuild. Ignoring? Tens of thousands in lost sales, plus hiring woes 'cause who wants to work for a ""bad"" spot? One Vegas legal mag notes suing over defamatory reviews is tricky and pricey, often not worth it without proof. Proactive PR buries that negativity before it explodes your bank account.  **Ask me about other options.**

# So, How Do I Get Started with This Ongoing Approach?

Easy peasy—start by checking your online pulse daily. Use free tools like Reputation Return's Rep Radar to scan reviews and mentions across 100+ sites. Then, pump out positive vibes: Share customer stories on Insta or collaborate with influencers for authentic shoutouts. Respond to every review—good or bad—to show you care; it turns 70% of folks more loyal. If you're in a pinch, hit up pros like Reputation Return for a free consult—they're Vegas-based and ace at blending PR with rep fixes. Make it a habit, like your morning coffee, and watch your biz thrive even in tough times.

# Wrapping It Up—Is This Really Worth the Effort?

Heck yeah! In Vegas's wild ride, ongoing digital PR and rep management isn't a luxury***—it's survival.*** It shields you from slumps, builds loyalty, and keeps the cash flowing. Skip it, and you're gambling with your future. Ready to level up? Start today. Your wallet (and sanity) will thank you. Cheers to keeping Vegas businesses shining!

1mt10wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechInUse/comments/1mt10wj/why_are_the_best_wireless_earbuds_xiaomi_redmi/,Why are the best wireless earbuds Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 Pro so popular,"Xiaomi BHR7660GL and Its Standout Design  

The Xiaomi BHR7660GL (better known as the Redmi Buds 5 Pro) caught my attention right out of the box. The vegan leather texture on the case felt surprisingly luxurious. There's a subtle charm to the marble-designed ear stem that’s both stylish and understated, making these earbuds look like they belong to a much higher price tier. The compact dimensions made it easy to toss the case in my pocket, barely noticeable due to its light weight. The durability aspect also didn’t disappoint as the case material held up fantastically against casual scratches through a week of daily commutes.  

The earbuds themselves have a rounded tip for a snug fit, and let me tell you, they don’t budge once they’re in position. I did a quick gym test—cardio, weight training, and even some burpees—and these little guys stayed firmly in place. Besides comfort, I appreciated their minimalist and modern aesthetic, which suits any environment, whether you’re in a business meeting or jogging at the park.  

**Highlights**  
- Stylish vegan leather case for a refined look.  
- Lightweight and pocket-friendly dimensions.  
- Marble design on ear stems adds an elegant touch.  

Check [Xiaomi BHR7660GL] price on Amazon.  

Sound Quality Elevated  

Audio is where these earbuds shine. The custom coaxial dual-driver design includes an 11mm bass driver coupled with a 10mm piezoelectric ceramic tweeter. Without diving into the jargon, these drivers did an excellent job at reproducing sound across the spectrum. The highs were crisp without being too sharp, mids felt warm and balanced, and the lows packed a punch.  

My test playlist ran from classical violin pieces to bass-heavy EDM, and the earbuds handled both beautifully. Watching movies on my tablet became a more immersive experience thanks to the built-in surround sound, which genuinely brought out the little details often missed on basic headphones. I couldn't help but be impressed by how these managed rich, Hi-Fi sound consistently over a week.  

**Performance and Battery Life**  

The promise of a 38-hour battery life with the charging case was enough to pique my interest, and after some hands-on use, I’d say it delivers. I managed around 9-10 hours on a single charge for the earbuds alone, which covered long work sessions and movie marathons. With fast charging, the ability to eke out 2 hours of music from a 5-minute charge saved me multiple times when I forgot to top them off.  

Bluetooth connectivity was stable within the promised range of 10 meters, and I found that the dual-device connection feature works like a charm. Switching from my laptop (for work calls) to my smartphone for music on the go became seamless. No hiccups, no retethering—the convenience is hard to overstate.  

Active Noise Cancellation on these earbuds is solid, with up to 52dB noise reduction eliminating most background interruptions for a quieter environment. I tested them at a bustling coffee shop, noisy train station, and home with barking dogs—the results were consistently satisfying.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Reliable 38-hour battery with impressive quick charge.  
- Noise cancellation cuts out everyday distractions effectively.  
- Smooth dual-device connectivity eliminates pairing frustrations.  
- Bluetooth has stable connectivity without lag.  

Built for Conversations  

Making calls in noisy environments is often a gamble with earbuds, but not with these. The Redmi Buds 5 Pro features three built-in microphones backed by AI noise reduction, making my voice clear on every call. I conducted a few business meetings over Zoom and called my friends while taking a windy evening walk. Everyone I spoke to commented on how remarkably clear my voice was, even when cars were whooshing past me.  

Transparency mode deserves a special shoutout too. It was surprisingly handy in everyday life, whether I was crossing streets or ordering at a busy drive-through. Switch on ambient sound mode, and you still get a great sense of your surroundings without compromising much on music clarity.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Transparency mode is great but feels slightly artificial in enhance voice mode.  
- The carrying case feels a bit too slick at times; rubberized footing would stabilize it on surfaces.  

Smart Comparisons to Product Rivals  

When pitted against similarly priced competitors like Samsung Galaxy Buds and OnePlus Buds Pro, the Xiaomi offering has some clear advantages. Its Hi-Res Audio certification and LDAC support are rare at this price point, which makes the audio quality genuinely stand out. Plus, the vegan leather and marble accents bring a unique design touch that its rivals lack.  

On the flip side, the ANC feature doesn’t match up to the likes of Apple’s AirPods Pro in hostile noise environments like airplane cabins. Some competitors also offer touch response customization, whereas these earbuds stick to preset commands. However, for someone looking for solid all-around performance without spending premium bucks, these crush most of their peers in value and battery life.  

**Cost Efficiency**  

From a price-to-features perspective, are these worth it? Absolutely. The fact that you’re getting LDAC support, Hi-Res sound, effective noise cancelation, multi-device pairing, and reliable hardware all in one package makes this a no-brainer for bargain-focused shoppers. Other earbuds with similar specs would set you back a significant chunk more.

We moved here a little over 7 years ago and I know that finding resources and knowledge (and even getting into the community/groups of riders) can be a challenge or a little intimidating.

So to bring folks together, we're having our first All-Rider Weekend for any and all interested in Motorcycles at [Top Dead Center on Aurora Ave](https://www.topdeadcenterseattle.com/all-rider).  
  
As the name implies, anyone interested in motorsports is welcome to come ask questions or meet folks in a very informal setting.  
  
Friday is aimed at beginners with Choosing the Right Gear, endorsement and next steps, while Saturday is more in-depth for interest groups and some light tech sessions - there's an easy group ride on Sunday to get familiar with riding in a gaggle and we'll visit some moto friends in the area. Tamales at the end :)

Something for everyone, with lots of knowledge from local experts. If nothing else, come grab a sandwich and a beer/coffee at [the cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/G9Ps27zxfsA4FLfP7) :)

I see him every Sunday at church and we always talk during coffee hour. He’s always very nice to me and we very good conversations and he’s also a very good looking guy. Like I said, I talk to him almost every Sunday but I have no idea if he has a girlfriend because I’ve never asked him so I decided to ask another mutual friend of ours from church if he knows if he has a girlfriend and he told me “just ask him cause I don’t know but made it very obvious that you were into him lady sunday” and that’s all that happened so I decided to ignore him today so I didn’t even say hi to him today. We sat at the same table as always but I didn’t even talk to him today at all. I did catch him staring at me during the service but I didn’t speak a word to him and neither did he. He didn’t greet me today either so neither of us spoke a word to each other even though we were sitting at the same table so I have no idea what to do. I really do like him a lot. There’s just so many qualities about him that I like, not to mention he’s very good looking. If he doesn’t have a girlfriend, I was going to shoot my shot but he completely ignored me today so I don’t know if the mutual friend I told, told him that I liked him cause he completely ignored me today although to be honest, I ignored him too today so I don’t know what’s going on.

1mt0x5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mt0x5v/does_amazon_basics_basket_coffee_filter_truly/,Does Amazon Basics Basket Coffee Filter Truly Improve Brewing? In-Depth Review,"The Amazon Basics 45-200/623 Basket Coffee Filters have been part of my daily brewing routine for a while now, and I have plenty to say about these understated yet practical disposable filters. These basket-style coffee filters aim to provide dependable coffee filtration, and they are marketed as fitting most 8-12 cup basket coffee makers. I wasn’t entirely sure how they’d stack up against higher-end or premium brands, but after consistent use, I’ve unearthed their merits, quirks, and overall performance.

**Design and Build Quality**

Something that immediately stood out to me was the sturdiness of the filters. Made from 100% plant-based fibers, they feel slightly thicker compared to cheaper disposable options I’ve tried in the past. The basket shape effortlessly fit snugly into my coffeemaker. Even moments when the coffee machine sputtered during brewing, there were no surprises with tears or leaks. The white color lends a clean, classic aesthetic. They are compostable, too (meeting ASTM D6868-11 standards), so there’s a bit of eco-friendliness to the design, although composting facilities are not available in every area. If environmentally friendly products matter to you, these filters tick that box.  

**Brewing Performance**

Whenever I prepare a pot of coffee, I’m critical about the flavors and the texture. These filters excel at trapping gritty sediment while letting the rich taste of the coffee shine through. Unlike some thinner filters that allow particles to sneak into the coffee pot, these genuinely perform well at leaving you with a clean cup of coffee. The capacity to work consistently with 8-12 cup coffee makers is another point of praise. I’ve run back-to-back uses in different machines, each operating smoothly without any messy issues.  

Check [Amazon Basics 45-200/623] price on Amazon.

**Merits**

- Durable paper construction prevents tearing during brewing processes.  
- The compostable nature satisfies those pursuing sustainable practices.  
- Even filtration ensures no stray grounds end up in your coffee cup.  
- Compatibility across most basket-style machines simplifies the selection process.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- While compostable in theory, limited access to composting facilities may limit practical usage for some.  
- The material, though sturdy, is not bleach-free, which eco-conscious users might find less appealing.  

**Ease of Use**

Using these coffee filters is straightforward. The packaging makes it easy to grab one filter at a time without any of them sticking together—a frustration I’ve encountered with other filters. Whether I’m brewing my first cup of the day before work or a late pot for guests, there’s no hassle. My only nitpick might be disposing of them if you live in an area where composting isn’t readily available; they essentially become ordinary waste.

**Challengers**

Coffee enthusiasts or everyday drinkers might compare these filters to other competitors like Melitta basket filters. While Melitta might offer unbleached options, I found these filters slightly sturdier than their counterparts. They didn’t fold or collapse under pressure during brewing processes. However, if sustainability trumps the importance of durability for you, premium unbleached filters might be a better fit. These, however, remain the more economical choice without sacrificing taste or filtration quality.

**Affordable Quality**

Taking into account the long-term reliability and slightly above-average features, these coffee filters offer fantastic value for their purpose. They aren’t flashy or embellished with excess branding claims. Still, they stick to the core promise of being a dependable, daily-use product. This item strikes a balance between affordability and function while providing a pleasing brewing experience. If you prioritize cost-efficiency with no surprise compromises, they won’t disappoint.

***The House***: A charming duplex just east of Lake Merritt! While the master bedroom is private, there is a kitchen and living room which are both shared with two other housemates, both of whom are kind, sweet, quiet, clean, and respectful trans people. **MUST BE TRANS AND LGBTQ FRIENDLY TO BE CONSIDERED FOR SUBLET**. The kitchen comes well stocked with ingredients, and the living room hosts a variety of streaming platforms and a comfortable couch. There is both a washer & a dryer on-site, down a short flight of stairs, which is shared with our downstairs neighbors. There is also bike parking and off-street parking in the back of the house for anyone with a vehicle who might benefit from it.

I've seen this sub suggested a bunch and you all seem lovely so I thought maybe someone could help me out with some suggestions for a Fragrance.

I lost my full sense of being able to smell things about 2 years ago now due to Covid and sadly my sense of smell and taste seem like they wont ever recover.

Things fall into 3 catagories for me in regards to scents. 

1.) No smell at all. Just blank. Even strong chemical smells, like bleach or fresh baked bread smell like nothing.

2.) Death. Its an almost sour dead thing smell, its mostly happens with meat or coffee. Its foul. 

3.) Slightly sweet. This is the most common, say like candles, perfume or anything you think would smell good. I can't identify any notes of it tho. So like vanilla smells the same as flowers, citrus smells the same as toothpaste. It all merges together. Its wild. I can tell its a good smell but its very faint.


So with this problem, I can not find a perfume due to not actually being able to tell if it smells like I want it too. I've tried a bunch of samples but everything smells the same, that slightly sweet smell. 

So I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me identify and pick some good options based on my pre-nose blindness likes?

I adored vanilla, that sweet almost dusty type. Think roasted marshmallows. Sweet deep smells like burnt caramel. I also really liked musk, that deep alluring type. Plus a little bit woody. So basically vanilla/sugar sweet but make it adult and sexy. I didn't really like citrus or flowers. 

My pre-nose blind perfume was discontinued and I need a replacement but literally can not tell what perfume smells like what. I wanna smell pretty :(

But I always am left wondering what if I had a vehicle like I do now, but there. Would I have left? I basically became bombarded with the scenesters. This happened to me in Brooklyn too. I’m from NY but always yearned for the NW. I didn’t mind getting around on the max and buses when I was there but I feel like my options were limited and maybe I would have branched out more and just stayed. Since I’ve been back in the northeast the humidity is what kills me. 

I was wondering is the northwest even livable anymore? I’m a mail man and can afford 1500 rent to live alone. Living alone would have to be the play. No roommates. Are there any places close to portland or more likely Seattle that can be affordable in that price range and have a few grocery store options, good food, laid back, less cars, etc but still be close enough to commute into either of those cities because most likely any transfer that would happen quick would have to be to a bigger city. Also I’m curious what Spokane is like? Does it have more of hotter feel in the summer? Are there still the towering Doug fir trees everywhere like near the coast. Is Vancouver WA basically just over flow from portland now and unaffordable? I used to live in St. John’s and Kenton and really liked it at the time but can’t imagine its even close to the same. I know this is scattered but I think all and all nothing is gonna give me that northwest feel again. That twin peaks feel. The fog coming out the trees. Any info appreciated.

I just finished the MVP for a side project I’ve been hacking on: [biteboard.club](https://biteboard.club) .

It’s a simple app where you and your friends can compete on eating habits — specifically **home-cooked vs restaurant meals**. You log your meals, see streaks, and check a leaderboard over 15 days. The idea is to add a friendly social + accountability angle, instead of tracking calories or nutrition (which I always drop after a week 😅).

I actually built this because competing with friends helped me build habits in the past (like running and exercising). I wanted to apply the same principle here for food — and personally, I want to get better at cooking my own meals instead of defaulting to takeouts.

Right now it’s pretty basic — create a group, invite friends, log your meals, and track scores. But I’d love to hear your thoughts:

* Would you find this useful?
* What features would make it more valuable?
* Have you tried similar apps, and what worked/didn’t work for you?

🔮 **What’s next on the roadmap & tech stack?**  
Planned features include:

* **Custom challenges & bets** – e.g., loser sponsors coffee or pays up a small fun penalty
* **Different ways to compete** – e.g., green veggies week, protein intake, or calorie competition, beyond just home-cooked vs restaurant.
* **Configurable lookback windows** – currently only 15 days, but adding options for longer tracking and competition periods.

It is dark colored, looks almost exactly like coffee, but it is a lot more viscous. It is nearly soup like in its consistency. There is not very much odor but it smells vaguely sweet, hard to describe. The flavor is like if you combine cacao, molasses, and coffee. Heavy on the molasses flavor. No hint of earthiness or bitterness. Just a very strange sweet and rich flavor again, very similar to molasses but not quite.

It's very difficult to describe. But I felt that somehow the drinking of this liquid was somehow significant.

We’re not looking for a big city, but we do want:
	•	Good schools
	•	Plenty of kid-friendly activities
	•	Coffee shops, parks, and unique little stores (my wife loves those)
	•	Opportunities to be outdoors more as a family

A little about us:
	•	We both work remotely (combined salary ~$150k)
	•	We own a home here (worth ~$280k, owe ~$220k)
	•	I enjoy exercising, spending time with the kids, and getting outdoors
	•	My wife enjoys shopping, coffee, and spending time with the kids too

The hardest part would be leaving behind her family, but we already live about an hour away from them, and being closer has its upsides and downsides.

I went to meet someone off hinge for a coffee/walk. We’ve been chatting for about 6 weeks, I didn’t mind the time and slowness of it at all, it was one convo over a day a week and then eventually picked up. He asked if I wanted to go on a walk on Tuesday evening, and after I said yes he disappeared for a few days and then confirmed plans on Friday. Ended up meeting Saturday morning. We started chatting and when I asked for his last name, he outright refused, in an annoyed tone told me it doesn’t matter. The reason I asked was because he asked me mine. I did eventually do a Google search after I got home and found his last name, nothing sketchy came up.

While we were talking I would say something and he wouldn’t be solely focused on what I was saying, his eyes would shift elsewhere and he would cut me off with whatever caught his interest, and facts he knew about it, and then eventually return to what I was saying or I’d redirect. I mentioned I was a hockey fan, mentioned he used to be, and when I said I didn’t understand baseball and wasn’t really a fan he ensured I did understand it by explaining it instead of just realizing maybe it was just not my thing like I had expressed,and I just prefer to watch hockey instead.

When we were chatting online he told me he was detoxing from drinking for a month, yesterday he said he had a drink Friday and broke the detox. He also mentioned he went to a swingers club three times. Twice with a friend and once by himself. The thing was he made it sound like it was a really long time ago, but he also knew the schedule of events and told me about them. I don’t know how to feel about that tbh.

We ended up hanging out for a few hours and I was hungry, he asked what I was doing for lunch cuz he planned on going grocery shopping to make food at home. Ended up walking with him cuz it was on my way home. He invited me over twice saying he could make food but I said no, and then when I was about to head off in another direction he walked with me and then said at least come by to drink water since it’s hot and we’ve been out for hours. So I did end up going but was hesitant tbh. He kept his distance at his place and gave me a water bottle to head back home with. I did notice a pack of beers in his fridge but never brought it up. I think he just wanted to show off his space but I felt leaving a bit uneasy.

I don’t have much experience with dating and kind of struggle to navigate people so I’m not sure, the whole last name thing also didn’t make sense to me. Do people not like sharing their last name? I keep mine off my dating profile because I don’t want anyone figuring out where I work, but I’d tell someone if I met them, not shut them down for asking. Do people also generally not buy food if it’s past lunch? I was starving to to point my stomach hurt, it was hot outside, but I didn’t want to put someone in a situation to buy food if they didn’t want to spend the money so I didn’t say anything.

His yoga instructor is someone I knew from childhood. She was friends with someone who mercilessly bullied me, and constantly told me I was weird. When he mentioned the name I went quite quickly and said we didn’t run the same circles. Also felt weird about that too.",0,1755459780.0,WhatShouldIDo,1,0.5,False

Content is important—but it loses flexibility without codes in digital formats. Coded into a host—a file—content becomes alive. The higher the complexity of the code language, the higher the content of the file. And with that, the will to control the digital components interconnecting.

You are just you—a consciousness with no identity.

You: So you’re saying you just met a girl who looks beautiful?  
Nalga: Yes.  
You: And… how exactly would you describe her beauty?

Nalga shrugs, sipping coffee. He sits with his back to the black, gray, and brown tones of the café. A meaningful conversation unfolds in the file of Cafés and Relaxations. Two consciousnesses—no, three, four, more—all attending to their little digital space. A decoration of normality, rhyming with music, rendered with longing and reminiscence.

Nalga: Uhhh… uhnmmm… well…

He sighs, gathering the beauty of the woman he saw—admired, charmed by, igniting desire within him.

You: Well…?

Nalga: Her figure was a simplicity of pretty. Her hair, silky smooth. Her voice… it was a melody that could lull me to slumber.

He thinks of her movements, her scent. Desiring. How would her touch feel? How would her nurturing take form? What would it be like to be with her?

You: I know you’ve had your fair share of gray sexual experiences. Compared to me—a virgin.

Chuckles.

You lean closer, arms crossed, elbows resting on the desk. The café is filled with busy steps, relaxed steps, and cocoa scents flirting with the air in a lively atmosphere.

You: Also… no need to be a party pooper, but you do realize anyone can download beauty, right? Even beauty that defies basic standards.

Nalga sighs.

Nalga: I know, I know. But I can’t help it. There are many female consciousnesses dancing poetry and rain in dresses. Souls that are mature, nurturing. Ones that offer comfort, health, and freedom—not just sex and pleasure.

You: Pshhh… you’re just a sex-craved conscious. Your aura sprays it—it signals confidence and strength. That’s why female consciousnesses are drawn to you like a magnet whenever you visit public sites. The Pink File, Red File, Yellow File, Violet File… sometimes even the White File. That’s where they gather.

He sits back, ears absorbing the steps and liveliness.

You: I feel like you’re doing it on purpose.

Nalga startles, then regains composure.

Nalga: I don’t know… I don’t know why. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

He sighs—a breath of longing, a speck of guilt.

Nalga: Do you think I can find love?

The question is heavy. Personal. Sharp.

You: I’m not the right guy for this. I’m a virgin. I’ve never tasted love. Yet I know—it comes with complexities. Guilt. Desire. Comfort disguised as thorns and blades. Warmth that slowly burns your consciousness into an inactive state.

You let your words hang in the air. Nalga listens.

You: I don’t know what I want. I’m confused—navigating the world, personal space, and the emotions we consciousnesses carry in molecules.

Nalga snarls, then sighs it off. He tries to understand where you’re going with this, shoulders slumped.

You:Every day I take on a challenge—a file that gives me something related to what I want. But my point is: I think every person, or rather every consciousness, is both dangerous—black and gray—but also like a silent crystal lake. One consciousness may remain on one side, but most are mixtures of both, shaped by their own reasons.

Nalga: I guess so, eh? Hey, I can’t believe we’re still friends. We’re so different, yet similar.

He smiles—grinning ear to ear, eyes sparkling with genuine emotion. A stark contrast to his actions toward female desire and sex. A consciousness seeking true love, yet sabotaging himself.

You: Yeah, I agree… it’s quite amazing.

You speak, but your words carry no emotion. Yet they’re played well enough for someone to believe.

The sun sets slowly, in rhythm with coastal guitar strings playing a raw tune.

Rain… Rain…

Dark clouds loom. Cities stretch beneath thunderstorm dances.  

SPLURT!

Blood pools—stretching miles across the Web Route. A code-language route leading to a file promising physical pleasures as reward. Taboo. Erotic.  

The first trial: walk through the pool, weighted by rain and thunder.  

Run… run… pant… splurt…

Heart pounding. Blood pressure rising. You’re not alone—ten people run beside you. Men, women, children, elders. All clinging to life. All different in motion. Battling the weight and stench of the pool. Waves splash and shout in aggression—chiming with thunder.

Repeat: Waves and splashes shout in aggression with thunder.

Dirt drools down each side, mixing with crimson.

Time is limitless… yet it can be changed each month.  
July 2030 is the month of “Limitless.” Time stops in your favor. A break. A freedom. An unraveling of will.

They—the runners—crawl, swim, sob, ache. All aiming for the file.

An obstacle appears. An email links to your hand.

From: Language77@Spectrum.Sci.World

Subject: An attack of flies made of
musk, sewage, and intestine folds.
  
Weapon: 30 minutes use.  
Choose:  
1. Flamethrower  
2. Puffer poison powder  
3. Protective suit

You have one minute.

QUICKLY!

Tension rises. Each person chooses.  
Four pick flamethrowers. Four pick poison powder. One picks a suit.  
You pick…

Flies rush in—thorns of poison, burning skin.  
After 40 minutes of unrest, strain, and struggle…

Ten died. Two survived.

You survived. Was it the suit? The powder? The flamethrower?  
In such trials, choices rarely make logical sense.

A chorus sings for the survivors—an old man in a tracksuit, and you.  
The rest drowned. Washed away by the crimson pool.

Thunder ceases. Rain slows.

The file copies itself. Who receives it—you or the old man?

Either way, both of you have it.

ERPH.zzz
The file name shortens. Shrugs play out.

You turn away, walking uphill from the silenced pool.  
Clothes drenched in blood. Bare feet on glistening green grass.

You open the file. It glows. Slowly.

It plays a jam—music you love, no matter the language, genre, or time.

Dark clouds clear. Blue sky emerges.  
Across the hill, separated by calm crimson waves, the old man smiles.  
He holds the document—lustful, satisfying, promising.  
He waves, turns, and walks to his private room.

You look up at the sky with nano eyes scanning.  
Birds chirp. The sun caresses your skin.  
City sounds surge in the distance.

You breathe...

“Finally, I’ve completed. We started many… but finished few.”

You look at the glowing file.

“With this, I can either sell it for millions… or indulge in my selfish sexual desires. It can manifest my specific imaginations in personal space.”

You turn to walk your path.  
Pride and satisfaction wash over you.  
You’ve overcome the challenge.

Now then… what will you do with the file?

Let’s just get real for a second—being a creator in this digital jungle can feel like running a marathon while juggling flaming swords, right? You’ve got to keep pumping out content, engaging your audience, and staying ahead of trends… while sipping on that lukewarm coffee. But what if I told you there’s a slick AI content trick that can lighten your load and boost your creativity **today**? And guess what? It's like finding a cheat code before the game developers patch it! 🎮💰

Results here: [https://mark---lawrence.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-ai-vs-authors-results-part-2.html](https://mark---lawrence.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-ai-vs-authors-results-part-2.html)

The exercise was really interesting, and I'm really grateful to the OP who alerted the subreddit to this the other day, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1mry334/mark\_lawrence\_has\_pitted\_ai\_vs\_human\_authors/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1mry334/mark_lawrence_has_pitted_ai_vs_human_authors/)  
because I personally haven't seen any AI fiction work as I tend to stay away from AI content generally, and have mostly seen AI stuff in academic/professional contexts so I'm more used to seeing its ""tells"" there. Spoilers ahead if you haven't gone to take the test yourself.

For the stories, I was trying to use the following ideas to 'tell' AI from human:  
\- whether the intro was too exposition-y  
\- inconsistencies of details, or superfluous details that a real writer wouldn't include  
\- incorrect/nonsense/wrong details  
\- flow, structure, and 'point' to the story  
\- classic ai style tells like: if not A, then B; overuse of em dashes; any obvious copycat details from real works; clichés and so on

What I learned is that not only is my list not good enough, I was way too negative and biased negatively so when reading. I incorrectly marked human work as AI work twice out of the 8 stories, and one AI piece as human. My headline result is, if you're looking at a test for novelists writing flash fiction vs ai, the easiest way to tell the humans apart from ai is the classic human mistakes a novelist inexperienced in writing flash fiction WOULD make. This means my personal takeaway from this test is that students of literature and language, and fans of the specific writers, will much more easily tell the human works apart from ai than the average reader. And, that all of us suck at identifying AI, and so it's important to specifically learn the tells, in the same way we do literary analysis more generally! 

I'd love to hear how you all identified tells/giveaways for the stories for the ones you got correct. Feel free to stop reading here and comment, but I want to add my personal notes for each story. 

1 - I incorrectly identified this human written story as AI. I thought it was AI because of the detail of 'granddam' seeming unnecessary in a short, and because the 'trestle bridge' swapped between being referred to as a 'plank bridge' and trestle bridge. Clearly that was just a human error requiring editing. This story had the most interesting premise/twist, and I actually going back to it today, feel sad I scored it so low, it didn't deserve it. 

2 - I correctly identified this one as human. The vulgarity was the first thing  I used, and the vaguely political point, but really the structure seemed more self-contained, and it had innately human qualities I can't quite put my finger on. Saying 'defecate' instead of 'shit' felt like a specific human choice, in amongst all the other vulgarity - why not swear? it felt like a choice that a human would make, rather than ai being inconsistent. 

3 - I correctly identified this one as AI. The details felt copied from authors I've read before. it didn't really seem to have a point. There were inconsistent details of the combat that occurred, scorchmarks appearing for no reason on body parts not mentioned before, that sort of thing. This one felt easy, though I was impressed/horrified at how close to real human prose it was, rhythm-wise. But the actual content of the dialogue made no sense and didn't feel like something a real accomplished author would write. How you going to choke on a soul? 

4 - I clocked this one incorrectly as human. The violence and BDSM undertones felt like too many real-life pieces I've read before. I even had a specific author in mind for this one. The homophobia, the sexually charged rapey nature felt too much like something a real person would write instead of AI. On reflection I feel like some of the description choices are a bit off, but I'd love to hear specifically if you correctly identified this one, what tells gave it away? 

5 - I correctly identified this one as AI, and was surprised when so many voted it human! I scored it as the best one of the bunch, as it had a really interesting concept, felt well executed in terms of creating atmosphere and was a self-contained story. But - the detail that gave it away to me was the inconsistency of the demon demanding buy me a coffee, then ordered its own coffee despite being invisible, then gave the protag coins for the coffee. It all seemed weirdly out of place for how a human would have written the scene. 

6 - MUCH to my chagrin, I ummed and ahhed on this one and incorrectly flagged it AI. Looking back I can see Mark's writing voice all over it and I'm gutted! But the random pop culture references and chatty nonsense felt like someone telling an AI to do its best to create an informal conversational villain monologue and make it relevant to culture and that really threw me off. 

7 - I correctly called this one AI-written. Because what is a biscuit plate, anyone? The dialogue was wooden as all-hell, the opening of Tuesday afternoon felt silly and not what a human would write, and there was no point/nothing happened in the story. It just felt, similarly to 3 and 5, like nothing really happened. There was no story, it was just a scene with a demon in it. The human ones do tend to have a point. 

8 - This one hurt the most - I called one of my childhood favourite author's work AI. Again, I thought that the details were superfluous, the friend being implicated with smirks, the (in my opinion, humbly) clunky metaphor of the thundering up the stairs, and the 'net of cold iron' and mentioning silver blades twice, all felt too clunky. I had been deliberating which makes me extra salty because I can totally see Robin's voice in it looking back - Evory sounds like a girl from a Robin Hobb book, come on! And like 1, I scored it low but it does have admittedly one of the more interesting concepts/points across the 8 stories. 

So that's my results. How did you do, what did you think of this test, and what were the tells that gave AI away, and how do we equally spot a human written story?

Title: The Stalker of Black Hollow Lake

Chapter One: The Town That Forgot

Hollow Pines was the kind of town you only found on old, forgotten maps, clinging precariously to the edge of civilization. It wasn’t on any major highway; you had to know it was there, take a turn down a forgotten county road that eventually dissolved into gravel and then just – forest. Thick, ancient forests, trees so tall and gnarled they seemed to lean in, whispering secrets on the perpetually cool, damp air. A perpetual mist clung to the valleys, wrapping the town in a shroud of mournful grey. The buildings themselves seemed to sag under the weight of decades, paint peeling like sun-scorched skin, windows staring out like vacant eyes. This wasn't a town that forgot because it was careless; it forgot because it was afraid.

At the town’s very edge, nestled between jagged, black-streaked rocks and skeletal, leafless trees – even in summer – was Black Hollow Lake. It was not a lake for recreation. Its surface was invariably still, a perfect, obsidian mirror reflecting the bruised sky, giving no hint of the unfathomable depths beneath. Undisturbed for decades, it lay silent, a gaping, watery maw.

No one swam there anymore. No one even fishes there.

Not since the disappearances.

Back in the early ’70s, three children – two brothers, Thomas and Samuel, aged ten and eight, and their cousin, Lily, who was just seven – vanished. They had snuck out on a stifling mid-July night, drawn by the promise of a clandestine midnight swim, a daring adventure under the full moon. Their parents, frantic by morning, found their neatly placed shoes on the damp shore, three pairs lined up as if waiting for their owners to return from a dip. But nothing else. No footprints leading away, no discarded clothes. The lake was dragged for weeks. Local fishermen, strong and brave, took their boats out, their nets scraping the bottom in desperate, futile passes. State divers, accustomed to murky waters, plunged into its black depths, their powerful lights swallowed by the impenetrable gloom. But they found nothing.Just black water and silence. No bodies.No answers.The town whispered for a time, then it went quiet. The pain was too great, the lack of explanation too terrifying. So, Hollow Pines eventually stopped asking questions. They walled the lake off, figuratively, in their minds, building an invisible barrier of willful oblivion. It was easier to pretend the lake was just a lake, and the children had simply… wandered off.

Chapter Two: The Return

Fifty years later, I, Eli Mercer, a third-year college student with an insatiable appetite for the arcane and a major in folklore, returned to Hollow Pines. It was my ancestral home, though I’d only visited a handful of times in my life. My senior thesis, a grand culmination of my academic journey, demanded a truly compelling subject, and the chilling, half-whispered tales of Black Hollow Lake seemed to fit the bill perfectly. I envisioned myself, the intrepid researcher, peeling back layers of rural superstition to reveal the true, mundane facts. My grandmother, Elara, one of the last original residents who still clung to the town like a stubborn burr, met me at the door of her crumbling farmhouse. Her face, a roadmap of wrinkles, tightened when I told her my plans.

“That lake don’t take kindly to being remembered, Eli,” she’d rasped, her voice like dry leaves skittering across pavement. She clutched my arm, her grip surprisingly strong. Her eyes, usually dim with age, held a sharp, desperate glint. “You go poking it, it might poke back. Some things are best left buried, boy. The silence… it’s a blessing, not a curse.”

I laughed her off, of course, a dismissive, overly confident chuckle that felt paper-thin even to my own ears. I attributed her warnings to the melancholic nature of the town, the lingering trauma of the past. My grandmother, bless her old heart, was simply a product of her isolated environment, prone to exaggeration and a touch of the dramatic.

“Grandma,” I’d said, patting her hand, “it’s just water.  A tragic accident, maybe. Or a very unlucky series of events. I’m a student of folklore, not a ghost hunter. I’m here to document, to understand the community’s coping mechanisms, the evolution of local legends.”

Just an old ghost story, I told myself as I unpacked my research equipment: my high-definition camera, my audio recorder, my drone, my meticulously organized notebooks. A story that needed a rational explanation, a logical conclusion. What I couldn't comprehend then was that sometimes, the most logical explanation is the one that chills you to the bone.

Chapter Three: The Drawing

My initial days were spent interviewing the scarce handful of elderly residents who still remembered the disappearances, gathering fragmented accounts. Most of them offered little beyond grim silence or vague, fearful warnings, mirroring my grandmother’s sentiments. The official records were equally sparse, ending abruptly with a cold, unsatisfying “unresolved.” It seemed the town had truly done its best to erase the incident.

Frustrated but undeterred, I turned my attention to the abandoned ranger station near the lake. It was a skeletal structure, reclaimed by moss and ivy, its windows shattered like empty eye sockets. The air inside was thick with the scent of damp earth and decay, a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature. Dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight that pierced the grimy panes, illuminating the forgotten relics of a bygone era. I pried open a stubborn, rusted filing cabinet, its drawers groaning in protest. In the very bottom, hidden beneath decades of dried-up forms and forgotten memos, I found it: a small, leather-bound notebook. It seemed to have been locked away, concealed.

The pages within were water-damaged, stuck together with a strange, slick residue, smelling faintly of stagnant pond water. Carefully, meticulously, I peeled them apart, my fingers trembling with a mixture of anticipation and an inexplicable dread. Many were illegible, the ink bleeding into fuzzy patterns. But one sketch, surprisingly, remained clear, stark against the yellowed paper. It was a crude pencil drawing, yet rendered with a frantic, desperate energy that conveyed immense fear. Scrawled beneath it, in shaky, almost illegible script, were the words: “The Lake Stalker.”

I stared, mesmerized and repulsed. The creature depicted was a nightmare made manifest. It had disproportionately long limbs, twisted and gnarled like the roots of ancient, waterlogged trees, ending in what looked less like hands and more like splayed, bony claws. Its body was spindly, almost skeletal, yet seemed to bulge with an unsettling, fluid mass. The head was small, almost an afterthought, but dominated by a wide, gaping mouth, a cavernous maw filled with rows of needle-sharp, irregularly shaped teeth. Most chilling were its eyes: hollow, black pits that seemed to absorb all light, staring out from the page with an intensity that made my skin crawl. They weren’t eyes that saw; they were eyes that knew.

A shiver, colder than the damp air, traced its way down my spine. It was just a drawing, I reminded myself, a child’s night terror perhaps, committed to paper. But the sheer malevolence emanating from the sketch was palpable. I instinctively pulled out my phone and took a few quick, high-resolution photos, a strange thrill of discovery warring with a burgeoning unease. Then, as I turned the page, my gaze fell upon the trembling handwriting on the back:

“It waits in the stillness. Don’t go near the shore at night. Don’t speak its name.”

The final instruction resonated. It felt less like a warning and more like a desperate plea, a frantic attempt to contain something monstrous. My academic curiosity, however, had outweighed my instinct for self-preservation. I’d seen it.I’d thought of its name, even if I hadn't vocalized it. And I was, even then, planning my nocturnal visit to the lake.

Chapter Four: The Ripples Begin

Defiance, I suppose, was my undoing. Armed with my camera and a perverse sense of intellectual invincibility, I set up camp by Black Hollow Lake anyway. I needed footage.I needed undeniable evidence, a visual anchor for my thesis. I told myself it was for scientific documentation, for my academic career. In truth, a deeper, more primal part of me, the part that had been drawn to folklore since childhood, yearned for a glimpse of the unknown.

The evening descended rapidly, swallowing the last vestiges of twilight. The lake, true to its reputation, remained perfectly still, a sheet of polished obsidian reflecting the nascent stars. The air grew heavy, damp, carrying the faint, earthy scent of rotting leaves and stagnant water. My tent, a flimsy barrier against the encroaching darkness, felt woefully inadequate. I positioned my trail camera on a tripod, angling it towards the water, setting it to record on a motion sensor. I wanted to capture the nocturnal life of the lake, perhaps a deer coming for a drink, or a curious raccoon. Nothing sinister.

That night, sleep was a fitful thing, punctuated by the rustle of leaves and the distant hoot of an owl. When dawn finally broke, painting the sky with bruised purples and greys, I stumbled out of my tent, cup of instant coffee in hand, and retrieved the camera. My fingers fumbled with the playback. Most of the footage was mundane: a bat flitting across the frame, the occasional gust of wind disturbing the water’s surface.

Then, there it was.Just after 3:00 AM.

Ripples on the surface.Not from wind, they were too slow, too deliberate, emanating from the very center of the lake, radiating outwards as if something immense had risen from the depths. My breath hitched.The camera, usually so steady, seemed to shimmer. And then, a shape.Tall and impossibly slender, it rose from the dark water at the far edge, silhouetted against the faintest glow of the pre-dawn sky. It stood at the shoreline, too far for clear detail, but unmistakably there.

I leaned closer, my heart hammering against my ribs, reviewing the footage frame by frame. The figure didn’t move like a person. It didn’t move like an animal. It moved like it crawled upright--jerky, unbalanced, a series of lurching shifts that covered ground with impossible speed, then too still, frozen for unnervingly long intervals. It was as if its joints were not meant for land, or for the concept of graceful motion. It was wrong.Fundamentally, nauseatingly wrong.

On the last frame before the camera suddenly glitched out, freezing on a pixelated mess of static, I saw it, impossible to unsee:

The Lake Stalker.

It had turned its head, slowly, deliberately, its hollow eyes fixed directly on the lens, on me. Its grin, the cavernous blackness of its mouth, seemed to stretch impossibly wide, revealing those rows of jagged teeth. And its twisted limbs, dripping with black water, dragged behind it like wet, broken roots, leaving glistening trails on the damp earth. The screen went black.My blood ran cold, fear a raw, icy blade plunging into my gut. It wasn't just a drawing.It was real.And it knew I was there.

Chapter Five: It Comes Ashore

I didn't sleep again that night, nor did I break camp. A foolish stubbornness, a morbid fascination, held me rooted to the spot. I needed to understand.I needed another sign, something to confirm that what I’d seen wasn’t a trick of light, a hallucination brought on by sleep deprivation and an overactive imagination. I clung to the rational, even as it slipped from my grasp.

But the real terror wasn't the image on the screen; it was the world outside my tent. The air grew heavy, almost viscous, thick with a scent I couldn't quite place – like old, brackish water mixed with something else, something metallic and rotten. My senses, usually my allies in observation, became my enemies, amplifying every subtle shift in the oppressive silence.

I lay awake, rigid in my sleeping bag, listening. The forest, which had been alive with chirps and rustles just hours before, was utterly, unnaturally silent. No crickets sang.No distant animal cries. No whisper of wind through the pines. Just an absolute, suffocating stillness that pressed down on the tent, suffocating my breath.

Then, I heard it.A faint, repetitive sound.

Scratch… scratch… scratch.

It was on the outside of my tent. Not the frantic clawing of an animal, not the gentle brush of a branch. This was deliberate.Like someone dragging a long, bone-thin finger across the taut canvas, slowly, rhythmically. The sound was dry, rasping, sending shivers down my spine.

My mind, desperate to rationalize, leaped to a prank. My grandmother, perhaps, trying to scare me away? Some local kids?But the impossible silence of the woods contradicted it. And the sound itself was too… precise. Too alien.

My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drum in the suffocating quiet. I squeezed my eyes shut, then forced them open. I had to see.I had to know.With a shaky hand, I reached for the zipper. Every fiber of my being screamed at me not to, but the overwhelming need to confront, to prove it was nothing, drove me.

I unzipped the tent, slowly, inch by agonizing inch, peering out into the pre-dawn gloom.

Nothing.

The air was still, heavy with that metallic, stagnant water scent. The ground was just damp earth and pine needles. I edged out, my gaze sweeping the immediate area. And then I saw them.

Wet prints.Not boots.Not paws.Something alien, something that defied easy categorization. They were long, slender imprints, like elongated fingers or toes, pressing deep into the soft soil, leading away from the tent and directly towards the lake. A trail of dripping, dark liquid followed them, glistening faintly in the gloom. It wasn’t just water; it had a thicker, almost viscous quality, like dark oil.

There was no sound now, not even the rasping scratch. No wind disturbed the trees.No birds broke the silence with their morning songs. Only a growing sense of immense pressure, like the lake itself was watching me, its cold, dark gaze fixed on my every move. It was no longer a natural body of water. It felt like a conscious entity, and I was deeply, terrifyingly, within its awareness.

Chapter Six: Grandma’s Warning

I returned to town the next day, shaken to my core, my previous arrogance shattered into a million pieces. My clothes reeked of that strange, foul lake-water smell, and my skin still crawled with the phantom sensation of those claw-like prints. I hadn't even bothered to pack up my camp. I’d simply fled, leaving everything behind in my desperate rush to escape that suffocating silence and the chilling evidence on the ground.

My grandmother met me at the door of her farmhouse. Her pale, sharp eyes took in my disheveled appearance, the wild look in my eyes, the tremor in my hands. A single, sharp gasp escaped her lips, and her face went ashen, blanching to a ghastly white. She didn’t need me to speak.She knew.

“You brought it back,” she whispered, her voice devoid of its usual rasp, a chillingly flat statement of fact. She recoiled slightly, as if my very presence radiated contagion. “You said its name. You woke it. I warned you, boy. I told you. You stirred the stillness, and now it stirs for you.”

I tried to laugh it off, a desperate, pathetic attempt at bravado, but the sound caught in my throat, a dry, rattling cough. “Grandma, I… I saw something, I heard something. It was just… a nightmare. I’m tired, I’m stressed.”

Her gaze, however, was unwavering, filled with a profound, bone-deep fear. “It’s not just a nightmare, Eli. It’s what our kind have kept sleeping for generations. And you… you ripped the lid right off its grave.”

The house, usually a comforting bastion of old-world warmth, suddenly felt cold and alien. The air, which had been clean moments before, began to thicken, acquiring that undeniable, metallic scent of stagnant lakewater. It was faint at first, then stronger, permeating the very fabric of the old house, seeping into the wooden floorboards, clinging to the heavy curtains, filling my lungs with its repugnant essence.

That night, I returned to my tent, as I lay in my sleeping bag, staring wide-eyed at the lantern dangling from the top of the tent, the smell intensified. It was as if the lake itself had seeped into the tent, its cold, dark presence filling the room. The lantern, already prone to flickering, began to stutter. The overhead light dimmed, brightened, then dimmed again, casting dancing shadows that morphed into grotesque figures on the tent walls.

Then, inevitably, the scratching returned.

Scratch… scratch… scratch.

It was outside the tent again

My entire body locked up, a primal terror seizing me. I clamped my hands over my mouth to stifle a scream, every muscle tensed, straining to identify the source. The smell of lakewater grew overpowering, suffocating me.

And then, the scratching stopped.

A guttural sob tried to tear its way from my throat. I squeezed my eyes shut, digging my nails into my palms, trying to convince myself it was a dream, a hallucination. But the cold was radiating from all around, the palpable presence, was undeniable. Something wet and heavy shifted, ever so slightly. I could almost hear the slow, ragged breathing just inches next to me, the faint, sickening sound of water dripping onto the tent. The grin, those hollow eyes, the twisted limbs – they were no longer confined to a drawing or a camera screen. They were here.Outside my tent. A silent, dripping horror, waiting.

Chapter Seven: The Vanishing

Eli Mercer was never seen again. The police, summoned by a terrified Elara Mercer the following morning after he didn’t return from the lake in the morning. They found no signs of forced entry, no struggle, no dropped possessions. Just an unsettling cleanliness, as if the tent had been meticulously tidied by an unseen force.

His laptop lay open on the ground in his tent, its screen glowing faintly in the morning light. The police technician, a young officer named Miller, hesitantly approached it. The display showed a still frame from Eli’s footage – blurry, pixelated, but utterly, horribly unmistakable. The creature.The grin, wider and more malevolent than anything Miller had ever seen, seemed to leer out of the dark. The dark, dripping figure, halfway out of the lake, was clearly visible, its grotesque form crawling up the shore, its hollow eyes fixed with predatory intent directly toward the camera, toward where Eli had been. Every detail from Eli’s frantic description was there: the twisted limbs, the bone-thin body, the wet roots trailing behind it.

The last file saved on his laptop was titled simply:

“It doesn’t just stalk the lake anymore.”

The police tried to dismiss it, of course. A hoax.A prank.A student obsessed with his folklore thesis, staging his own disappearance. But the eerie stillness that had settled over Hollow Pines,  the increasing frequency of strange disappearances in the surrounding areas – hikers, lone campers, a few curious tourists drawn by the town’s isolated charm – started to paint a different, terrifying picture. The lake’s boundaries, once a definitive barrier, seemed to have blurred, its influence spreading like a dark, noxious stain.

Chapter Eight: The Lake Today

Tourists began to visit Hollow Pines to see Black Hollow Lake, after the reports of Eli’s strange disappearance, out of curiosity and the mystery that surrounded the lake. After a few months tourists forgot about the disappearance and were drawn by its rustic isolation, its untouched natural beauty. They come with their cameras and their hiking boots, seeking an escape from the clamor of modern life. It’s quiet now.

Too quiet.

The water remains perfectly still, as it always has. A sheet of black glass, undisturbed by wind or wildlife. Locals, the few that remain and haven't fled the creeping dread, will warn you about that stillness. They say it’s not a sign of peace, but of profound, terrible anticipation.

They say if you stare into the reflection too long, if you let your gaze linger on the dark, fathomless depths beneath the glassy surface, you might see something that isn’t your own reflection looking back. Something that shouldn’t exist, shimmering faintly in the distorted light.

Something grinning.

Something waiting.

Because The Lake Stalker doesn’t always need to hunt. It learned a new, more insidious way from Eli Mercer. It learned that sometimes… it just waits for you to come closer. For you to become curious. For you to forget the warnings. And then, it simply reaches out, pulls you down into the endless stillness that is its domain, and adds you to the forgotten.",2,1755459435.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

1. Black coffee. 4 cups a day. It can reduce fibrosis. 50 times better if you use a french press. Coffee filters remove the benefits.
2. Milk thistle. Reduces liver inflammation 
3. Resdiffra removes fat from liver but prescription needed. Talk to your gastroenterologist.
4. No sugar or simple carbs. No pop or candy or chips or white bread.
5. Omega 3 fats. Eat salmon and sardines or take a supplement.
6. No beer. Too many carbs. Vodka or rum with no calorie mixer.
7. B vitamins. 500 mg of b1 and also a b complex vitamin. Stops wet brain.

Bonus: even a small amount of weight loss can reduce fat in liver significantly however I have found it next to impossible to lose weight while continuing to drink.

1mt0b7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1mt0b7h/reveal_if_the_best_electric_kettle_oxo_brew_is/,Reveal if the best electric kettle OXO Brew is worth the hype,"The OXO 8716900 Adjustable Temperature Kettle has been quite an exciting gadget to test out over the past few weeks, and let me just say, this isn’t your average electric kettle. As someone who is very particular about my morning tea and evening coffee, having control over water temperature has been a game-changer. The brand has made an ambitious promise with this kettle, offering features like precise temperature adjustment, borosilicate glass construction, and a hold-warm function. I put all these claims to the test, so here’s my take.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This electric kettle is a sleek but unassuming beauty with its combination of borosilicate glass and stainless steel components. It effortlessly blends functionality with aesthetics. The clear glass body, apart from being BPA-free, gives you a full view of the water level—a surprisingly satisfying feature when boiling water. I was particularly impressed by the borosilicate glass, which not only adds durability but also resists thermal shock. The markings in ounces and milliliters make it super easy to measure precise amounts, especially when you’re brewing something specific like pour-over coffee. The soft-grip handle stayed cool to the touch throughout, offering comfort and safety, even when the kettle is loaded to its 1.75L maximum.

**Ease of Use with the Adjustable Temperature Feature**  
What initially caught my attention about this kettle was the promise of customizable water temperature ranging from 170°F to 212°F. Whether it’s for green tea that needs cooler water or a boiling cup of instant noodles, the one-dial interface makes adjusting the temperature shockingly easy. The backlit digital screen clearly displays the selected temperature and also alerts you when it’s reached. It’s unpretentious but intuitive. The 360-degree swivel base was a particularly gratifying touch, letting me lift and set the cordless kettle back without awkward fiddling.

**Highlights**  
- The borosilicate glass construction adds durability and aesthetic charm.  
- Customizable temperature settings allow for precise brewing needs.  
- Cord-free design ensures easy transport from base to counter or table.  
- Removable stainless steel filter effectively strains water and is dishwasher-safe.

**Performance and Capacity**  
In terms of raw performance, this device boiled water faster than my microwave and much safer than my stovetop kettle. I timed it: it takes roughly 6-7 minutes to bring a full capacity of 1.75 liters of water to a rolling boil. Once heated, it lives up to its claim of holding the temperature steady for 30 minutes without any noticeable dip. While the keep-warm function is fantastic for habitual tea drinkers like me, it does add to energy usage, something to keep in mind if you’re trying to minimize electricity consumption.

**Safety First, Always**  
Let’s talk safety, because that’s a big deal when you’re dealing with hot water daily. The lid opens slowly in a controlled manner, effectively releasing steam without the burst of hot mist I’ve experienced with cheaper kettles. I felt much less risk of accidental splatter burns during initial boils. Add to this the cool-touch handle, and you’ve got a kettle that won’t make you panic when your hand grazes it unintentionally. The auto-shutoff feature is the icing on the cake, cutting power promptly when heating is complete.

**Good Points**  
- Comfortable handle and anti-slip grip for secure use.  
- Backlit digital temperature readout for crystal-clear control.  
- Soft-open lid ensures safety during the boiling process.  

**Drawbacks**  
Not everything here is sunshine and rainbows, though. For all the pros, I did find areas where the product could improve:  
- The knob used to set the temperature feels slightly fragile. It has worked fine, but I’m unsure of how it would hold up in the long term.  
- Unlike some electric kettles, this one doesn’t come with a descaling mode, and you’ll need to clean it manually with vinegar if you experience limescale buildup.   
- At 4 pounds, it’s not the lightest kettle out there. For elderly individuals or those with limited wrist strength, it might feel heavy when full.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Lack of a dedicated descaling mode.  
- Can feel heavy at its maximum capacity.  

**Competing Brands**  
When putting this kettle side by side with similar options like the Cuisinart CPK-17 and Breville BKE820XL, the differences came down to user interface and pricing. Both of these competitors offer multiple pre-set temperature modes, something the OXO model lacks despite giving you customizable adjustment. However, the borosilicate glass of the OXO kettle outshines both alternatives, which lean towards stainless steel. For anyone particular about aesthetic value and material, this kettle takes the upper hand. On the flipside, Breville’s kettle heats marginally faster and is better suited to pro coffee enthusiasts.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Generally speaking, this kettle offers pretty solid features for its mid-range price point, especially considering the premium borosilicate glass and the aesthetically pleasing look that matches modern kitchens. It’s an excellent pick if you drink a lot of specialty teas or coffees and need to fine-tune water temperature without guessing. However, for casual brewers who boil water without much finickiness, you might be better off with one of the more basic electric kettles out there.

I think I no longer believe in the idea of forever, there’s no such thing as friends forever, there’s no such thing as relationships forever ( sometimes ) 
Hear me out. You will never know how long you will have with someone, the best thing that can do is your part because it’s all that you can control. We take it so personal when someone leaves or it didn’t turn out the way you expected it to be. And we get upset when our personal “ investment” is thrown out the window, maybe stop thinking of people as possessions to hold onto, but as additions, seasons, experiences and sometimes lessons, even if you didn’t want them to be. I’ve realized, even in the midst of the hurt.  even through the worst of the worst, it will always end up working out for your good  somehow. BUT  what if you start cherishing people for the time that you have them instead of holding onto the idea of forever? I’m not saying to waste your time on people who clearly do not appreciate  you, but to cherish the people that are in your life right now for as long as you have them whether that be one year or nine, until we’re 25 or 90. Gratitude. It teaches us appreciate people more and to live in the moment and not take it so personal if it doesn’t work because you did all that you can do. And if it lasts, then good and if not, then at least you’ll know that you rode until  the wheels fell  off. 

Personal: I realized that this chapter is not about you anymore, I realized that I was 95% over you and the remaining 5% was never about you, but it was about me. You were the correlation, not the causation. I had the keys in my hand this whole time and it brought up some memories with you  that I had forgotten.

From a time we were teenagers to in our 20’s and Graduating college. But as I did eight months ago, and as I’m doing again, I’m choosing myself. 
Funny enough just recently you were right there, literally. For a moment, I hoped that just maybe,  for a second that you and I could have one last word. Almost  like a ships in the night that never collide. Sometimes when I think of  you,  because there is no more us. If I  could’ve ever spoken to  you again, I think it would be in a coffee shop. We’d  be across from one another in a booth not saying anything because presence is enough and there’s nothing left to say, The presence is enough to say , that this is the last time.  The last time that I would let myself think of you im any kind of intimate way. The  the way I used to laugh with you, the last time I think about the college all nighters we used to pull , the last time I think about how we would argue because all we would do is talk  and never get our work done. The last time I would beg you to play a new video game with me. The last time we could yap about nothing and be chronically online. The last time you would be the person that I love most at the time. Because now it has to be me and I realize that you were just a person, a flawed  person as am I. You’re just a girl. So here’s to the last time, and cherishing you for the almost decade that we had. 
All of it is okay. 

I didn’t get the job that’s okay. 
I didn’t get the girl  that’s okay. 
Things didnt turn out how  I thought they would that’s okay. 
Everything will work itself out . 

I know this was a bit long  but if anyone can take anything out of it, just know that everything will be okay, in the end. It always ends up being OK, and if it isn’t just yet, just know it is not the end. Signing off - 🫡",4,1755459163.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,6,0.83,False

# Best iPhone SE‍ Case with ‌Card ⁣Holder [2025]: Top Picks

The iPhone ​SE continues⁤ to be ‍a popular choice for users ​seeking a powerful smartphone in ​a compact form factor. However, its minimalist design often ‍necessitates the use of ​a protective⁢ case. ⁤Adding a‌ card holder​ to the case streamlines your everyday carry, eliminating the need for‌ a separate‍ wallet for essential cards.This allows for a more⁢ convenient and lightweight experience,especially for those who prefer to travel light or rely on mobile⁣ payments and access. This article will explore the top iPhone SE cases⁢ with card holders available in 2025, evaluating their ​features, ⁣benefits, and ideal ⁤user profiles to help you⁣ find the perfect match.

## Key Features Analysis

The leading iPhone SE⁤ cases with⁢ card holders boast a⁤ variety of features designed to protect your‍ phone and⁣ securely store your cards. ⁣The⁤ best​ options offer a⁣ balance of slimness,durability,and functionality.

**Material and Construction:**
The‍ material used in the case's construction​ plays a ⁤crucial ‌role in its ⁢durability⁢ and feel. Popular materials include ⁤Thermoplastic⁤ Polyurethane (TPU), Polycarbonate (PC), leather, and hybrid‌ combinations.​ TPU provides excellent shock absorption, ⁣while PC offers rigidity and ⁣scratch‍ resistance.Leather adds a touch of premium aesthetics and frequently enough ​improves grip.Hybrid cases combine these materials for a balanced ​approach, offering⁣ robust protection⁤ without‌ sacrificing ⁢style. the quality of the⁢ stitching (for leather⁣ cases) and the ‍molding⁤ of ‌the plastic directly impact⁣ the case's longevity.**card Capacity and Security:**
The‍ number of cards a case can hold varies depending ‌on‍ the design. Some cases ⁢accommodate only one or two cards, while others can hold ⁢up to five‌ or more. The security of the card storage is equally vital. Features such ‌as a secure snap‌ closure, a ​tight-fitting ‌sleeve, or a concealed compartment prevent cards from accidentally falling out.⁢ RFID blocking technology is a valuable addition, protecting⁤ your cards ​from electronic⁢ theft.

**Protection ⁢and Drop Resistance:**
A good iPhone SE case with a card holder‌ should provide ample protection ⁤against​ drops, scratches, and impacts. Look for cases with raised ​edges around the screen ​and camera to prevent ⁢direct contact with surfaces. Reinforced corners and ​impact-resistant⁣ materials further enhance⁢ protection. Some cases are even certified to ⁤meet military drop-test ⁣standards, ⁣indicating their ability to‌ withstand significant impacts.

**Bulk and Design:**
One of the key considerations for an iPhone SE case is its bulk. The ⁢iPhone SE is prized‌ for its compact size, so​ adding a bulky ​case​ defeats the purpose. The​ best ⁢cases offer a slim profile while still providing adequate ‌card ⁤storage and‌ protection.‍ Design is also an important factor,⁢ and‍ the available⁤ options range from minimalist designs to more elaborate ⁢styles with various colors ​and textures.

**Accessibility and Functionality:**
The case should​ not impede access to the iPhone SE's ports, buttons, and⁢ camera. Precise cutouts are essential for ensuring easy⁤ access⁤ to all functions. ​Raised button covers ⁤provide tactile feedback and protect the buttons from wear and tear. The card holder⁣ should also be designed for easy card insertion and removal, without being too loose or too tight.

## Core Benefits

An iPhone SE case with ​a‌ card holder offers several key benefits that enhance⁣ convenience and simplify your daily routine.

**Streamlined Carry:** Reduces the need for a separate wallet, allowing you to carry your essential cards and phone in one convenient package. This is especially⁢ beneficial‍ for those ⁤who ‌prefer to travel light or rely primarily on mobile payments. Having everything in one place minimizes clutter and reduces the risk of misplacing ‍items.

**Protection for ​Your Phone and ‍Cards:** A ‌well-designed‍ case protects your iPhone‌ SE from scratches, drops, and impacts, while also keeping your cards⁣ safe from damage. The secure ⁤card holder prevents ‌cards ⁤from falling out,while RFID blocking technology protects against electronic theft. This dual protection provides peace​ of mind.

**Enhanced Convenience ‍and Accessibility:** Having your ⁤cards readily available makes transactions quicker ⁣and easier. Whether you're paying for coffee, accessing public transportation, or showing your ID, your cards ‌are always ⁣within easy reach. This is especially⁣ useful in ‌situations where you need ‍to quickly access your cards without fumbling through a wallet.**Minimalist Style:** Combines practicality⁤ with aesthetics, offering⁢ a sleek and minimalist design that ​complements the iPhone SE's compact form factor. By eliminating⁢ the need⁣ for​ a bulky wallet, ‌a⁤ card holder ​case contributes‍ to a cleaner and more streamlined ​look.This aligns with the iPhone SE's design beliefs of simplicity and functionality.

## FAQs Section

**Will an iPhone‌ SE case with a card holder damage my cards?**
No, ⁤a ⁣well-designed case‌ should not damage your cards. Most cases ‍utilize secure and snug-fitting card slots ‍or sleeves that⁤ prevent excessive bending ⁣or ⁢scratching.Cases⁣ with RFID-blocking technology also prevent the demagnetization of magnetic stripe cards.Though, avoid overstuffing the card holder, as​ this can put​ undue pressure on the ‌cards and possibly damage them.

**Does an⁢ iPhone SE case with a card holder add significant bulk⁢ to‌ the⁣ phone?**
The amount ​of bulk added depends on the design of the case. Some cases are ‌designed to be ultra-slim, adding minimal thickness⁢ to the phone. Others ⁢may be slightly bulkier to accommodate more⁤ cards or provide⁣ enhanced protection.⁢ Look for cases⁢ that⁢ specifically⁤ advertise a⁤ slim profile ‌if bulk is a major‍ concern. Reading reviews ⁣and checking⁤ dimensions can also help you assess the ⁢case's overall size.**Are‌ iPhone SE cases with card holders compatible with wireless charging?**
Compatibility with‍ wireless charging can vary‍ depending‍ on the case's thickness and material. Some cases may ‌interfere with wireless charging,‌ while others are designed to be fully compatible.​ look for ​cases that explicitly state‍ they are‌ compatible with wireless charging if this is an⁤ important feature for you. You may need to remove some or ​all of ⁤the cards from⁢ the card holder for wireless charging​ to⁣ work ‌effectively.

**How‌ do I choose the ⁤right iPhone‌ SE case with ‍a⁣ card holder for my needs?**
Consider the ⁣following factors when choosing a ⁣case: the number of cards you need to carry, the level of‍ protection ​you require, your preferred style and design, ⁢and your budget. Read reviews from other ⁤users to get an idea of the case's quality, ⁢durability, and functionality. Compare different models​ and brands to⁤ find the one that best meets your specific needs ‌and ‍preferences.

As you might remember, I ended my last post with a delightfully heroic announcement. I was going to save Tiff, defy the road, and risk my very life to do so. As befits the commencement of any noble quest, I started my journey in the same way as any fearless hero.

I tried to get somebody else to do the work for me.

“Randall―” I began.

“I get the impression you're about to say something I won't like.”

“―we need to rescue the stranded truckers.”

“Thought so.”

“There has to be something we can do to get them out. Tiff doesn’t even have a vehicle anymore. She says her old one broke down, but maybe we can haul her a car.”

“We’re not in the business of handing free cars to non-employees.”

“I’ll buy it,” I said.

“Maybe she can share with Al.” The *other* driver stuck on Route 333. The one still driving.

“This isn't funny.”

“Of course, it isn't funny!” Randall slammed his hands on the desk and shot to his feet. “I find nothing humorous in you messing with things you have no idea about.”

“Maybe if you answered more of my questions, I *would* have more of an idea! You don’t get to hand us an obscure employee handbook then expect us to be good little soldier boys who follow your every order without ever giving us any explanations at all.""

“Yes, actually. I do get to expect that. That’s what the extremely generous salary is for.”

“Oh shove off. Money doesn’t let you treat us like crap.”

“Oh?”

I think it was his smirk that did it. Randall was fuming as much as me, but he still managed a satisfied smile as if to say, *You’re stuck. You know it. You won’t leave.* And he was right. Nowhere else paid this well, not for a college grad. I’d moved my whole life to California. I absolutely couldn’t go back now…

But that smirk.

“Find a new driver.” I stormed out of the office.

For any of you who’ve fantasized about doing the exact same thing at your current job, I can assure you it feels every bit as good as you imagined and more. I kept expecting the horror of what I’d done to hit, but it didn’t. Instead, I seethed on my drive home. I seethed as I heated up dinner in the microwave, and I seethed as I went to bed. 

It had been so long since I’d cared about anything, that I forgot how strong it could feel.

I woke up at one AM to a screaming cell phone.

Those of you who’ve read this far have probably noticed my attempts at sleep often get interrupted―faceless men watching me, exes licking my face, the likes. If you’re bored of this repeated occurrence, I’d just like to add my signature to that ballot. At what age did eight hours of healthy sleep become such a wildly unrealistic request?

I was so groggy I didn’t even bother to check the caller ID before picking up. Big mistake.

“We need you to come in,” Randall said. “*Now*.”

“It’s the middle of the night.”

“This is an emergency.”

I cussed him out. “If you’ll remember, I quit less than ten hours ago.”

“You're not still going on about that are you? You didn't quit. You just stormed out. Look, I apologize for whatever it is that made you so ticked earlier, alright? We good? Now, stop throwing a fit and get yourself to the terminal.”

“I'm not coming in.”

I hung up on him mid-sentence.

If I weren’t so tired that probably would have felt almost as phenomenal as walking out. At least until the point that Randall called again. 

I declined. He called again. I declined. He called―I kid you not―twelve more times. *Twelve.* Probably, I should have blocked him at that point, but I still wasn’t thinking straight. The thirteenth time, I finally picked back up.

“Stop!”

“*Please*.” Randall’s tone was different now. He’d lost his usual superior edge. There was only desperation. “Brendon, this isn’t a game. Come in tonight, right now, and I'll include a ten thousand dollar bonus on your next paycheck.”

My finger hovered above the hang-up button. “Not a bonus,” I said. “A yearly raise.”

“That's not how promotions work here.”

“It wouldn't be a promotion. You would be rehiring me. I already quit remember?”

Randall cussed me out. It felt good to hear him so undeniably lose his cool. “Fine! You win. You’ll get your rehiring bonus. Just come in.” His tone lowered. “Okay, but we're not really redoing the paperwork for you to be fired and rehired. That's just excessive.""

“It is.”

Did I feel like a sell-out? A little. But at least Randall was pissed. My grand defiance for authority had lasted barely eight hours, and I now knew my ego was worth a scant ten grand―more than I’d thought actually.

Student loans really are no joke.

As soon as I reached the truck yard, Randall handed me a cup of coffee and a set of keys.

“The trailer’s already hooked up. You don’t even need to take it far tonight, just get it onto Route 333, and then you can sleep for a few hours if you want.”

“Where am I going?”

Randall exhaled. He handed me a map, something he’d never done before (I hadn't even known maps of Route 333 existed), and showed me where I was headed.

“But that’s at least five days from here. That’s a ten day haul. I only brought one set of clothes.”

“I threw some of mine in the cab.” When I tried to interrupt, he held up his hand. “And *yes,* it’s one with AC.”

There was that at least.

“What’s in the trailer?” I asked.

He didn’t even respond, just raised an eyebrow, back to his usual condescending self. That was fair I supposed. I *had* agreed to take the job again, and I knew the rules. No peeking.

Obviously, I’d asked the other drivers about what we were hauling. They were more than happy to offer up knowledge like best pullouts for a quick nap, what diners fried the best bacon, and how to avoid running into the things with zippers on their stomachs. Any time I tried asking about our cargo though?

The mood changed. Their faces darkened. They sobered.

“Sometimes not knowing a secret can drive you mad,” Deidree confided in me once, “but sometimes it's knowing the secret that does it. In this job, you have to figure out which it is.”

I didn’t trust that management always had our best interests in mind, but I did trust the other drivers. I gave up asking what we were hauling. I let myself stop wondering. If I could live with not knowing that probably meant it was the latter of Deidree’s options: finding out would be the worse alternative.

That night though, driving through massive redwoods beneath a starry sky, I wasn’t sure. The not knowing. The *wondering*. It was going to kill me.

I was so distracted, it took me almost by surprise when my rig sputtered, slowed then stopped. By now, I knew to expect this interruption. It happened every trip down Route 333. The exact location would vary, but it always happened in the redwood section. 

Per usual, I clicked start on the stopwatch I’d begun carrying. Somewhere around a minute fifty-five, I stopped it. There was no point in keeping track of the time anymore.

I already knew I’d been stalled for too long.

*Control your breath. Don’t panic. Close your eyes. Hide.* 

This hadn't happened since my interview, but I’d always known this was a possibility. The other drivers talked about multiple minute time outs happening to them, and none of them had ever gotten hurt. All I had to do was crouch in between my seat and the sleeper bed, shut my eyes, and ignore the very real fact that these things had my scent.

The footsteps began. They scurried around my rig. Occasionally, things would tap or knock on the metal. Something yanked at the door handles. They stayed shut. At one point the entire truck shuddered as if a dozen bodies were slamming themselves against one side in an attempt to tip it. The truck stayed put.

It would get worse I knew. That’s what had happened the first time. The footsteps had increased steadily, until I could hear nothing else, and then the engine had started― except the footsteps didn’t get worse. Instead, the scurrying calmed down. 

The forest dwellers were still out there. I could hear the pitter of feet, but it was calmer, less frantic. Was this some sort of a trick? Did they think I couldn’t hear them and would open my eyes?

A moment later I knew that theory was wrong. They weren’t trying to hide. They were trying to quiet down enough to speak with me. 

“Give it to us.”

The voice wasn’t a voice exactly. It was the rustle of leaves, the snap of branches underfoot, and the tinkle of windchimes, all somehow combined in a way that formed words.

I held my breath.

“We smell you, He Who Dwells on Stone. Your odor has presented itself here once before, in our domain. We demand an audience.”

I kept still. Was there anything in the employee handbook about actually speaking with them? I didn’t think so, but maybe I’d missed it. *Maybe you should really read the whole thing, Brendon.*

The strange not-voice seemed to sigh. “Speak with us, or we slash your tires.”

A pretty convincing argument in my opinion. “What do you want?” I asked.

“The thing you carry in your moving device. Relinquish possession of it to us.”

“Interesting proposition. Unfortunately, the cargo isn’t really mine to begin with, so I’m not really in a position to hand anything over. I’m sure you understand.”

“Relinquish it, and we will allow you open passage through our lands for the rest of your travels. Do not, and we will tear apart your machine.” *Also* a pretty convincing argument.

“What is it?” I asked.

“That is not an answer one life force may give another.”

“K, so like you don’t know.”

“Of course we know,” the thing said defensively.

“Really? Because it sounds like you’re bluffing right now.”

“*We know!*” 

The thing calmed itself down. “Relinquish your load and we will allow passage to all of your kind for the next generation.”

I remembered the man skewered on the hood of his truck. These things weren’t bluffing. They could kill us and *easily* too. How many people would I save over a generation if I agreed?

And yet…

I didn’t know what was in my cargo, but I did know these things killed humans for merely looking at them. If they wanted my haul, it couldn’t be for anything good.  

So I did the only thing I could think to do. I stalled.

“How about a clue?” I asked. “Surely, you can give me a clue of what I’m hauling.”

It couldn’t, it informed me. So I pushed. The thing got more and more frustrated. I got more and more anxious. The footsteps grew restless again. They began circling my truck, looking for a way in. One of them―I got the impression it was the one speaking to me― scratched at the door. It slammed against the window. The sound of cracking glass.

“You are merely attempting to waste our time,” the forest thing accused.

“That is the plan. Yes.”

It slammed the glass again. More cracking. *Bad. Real bad.*

I could practically sense the creature drawing back, preparing for a third and final strike, about to break in―

The engine roared to life. I whooped and scrambled for the front. Just before I uncovered my eyes though, I realized the footsteps were still there, circling my truck. 

They hadn't left.

I didn’t consider. I didn’t allow myself time to think up a secondary plan. I just leapt into my seat, threw the car in drive, and slammed my foot on the gas―all without looking. 

The truck lurched forward. I forced my eyes to stay closed for *two, four, six* seconds, before letting them spring open. A turn was coming up. I jerked the wheel to the left but not in time to avoid the low hanging branches that battered against my front windshield. I retook control, never slowing once, and never glancing in the rearview.

I'd escaped. 

It was only a couple hours later, when I was well into the desert and far enough to feel comfortable, that I finally pulled to the side of the road to survey the damage. The driver window had splinters running through it. There were dents along the skirt of the freight carrier, but it was otherwise intact.

I circled to the back to make sure everything was still locked and secure. It was.

*Everything’s fine. Get some sleep. You’re fine.* 

And then, as often happens just after the movie protagonist says, “It’s all good, guys,” I was immediately disabused of my delusions of safety.

Something was crying.

I pressed my ear to the metal of the freight. Sure enough, inside the container, faint but audible, was a little girl’s sobs.

“Hello?” I asked. “Do you need help?”

The crying cut off. I waited another ten minutes with my ears pressed to the container, but the crying never started again. The thing stayed silent.

It would have been easy. For the sake of my sanity, I could have chalked it up to imagination. I was sleep deprived and in shock, and of course I’d heard crying. It was my own inner child acting out from revulsion at this entire stressful situation. That’s what it was.

But it wasn’t.

I’d learned something, though *what* I now knew, I wasn’t totally sure. Was the thing in the cargo bay a person? A creature? A child?

**Day 1 and 2:** **22nd-23rd; Fairbanks**

* Nothing concrete planned but some things of interest we've marked down include: Museum of the North, RG White Large Animal Research Station, Running Reindeer Ranch, Chena Hot Springs, Northern lights viewing at Murphy Dome or Creamer's field (not sure this will be feasible with cloud coverage as I've read end of August isn't super likely), HooDoo Brewing Company...open to other ideas!
* *Heavy on needing recommendations/prioritizations here :)*

**Day 3: 24th; Taking Alaska Railroad Denali Star train to Anchorage.** 

* We've heard great things about the trains in Alaska being fun experiences! This will take up the entire day, staying the night in Anchorage.

**Day 4: 25th; Taking Alaska Railroad Coastal Classic train to Seward.** 

* We arrive around 1130AM and will check into the hotel. 
* *Nothing concrete planned the rest of the day, would love suggestions on things to do and places to eat! Easy hike nearby anywhere?*

**Day 5: 26th; Seward**

* My husband and his parents love to fish (especially his mom (69), they love salmon and cod), so we've been looking at potential charters - *would LOVE any recommendations from those with first hand knowledge/experience*! I think their ideal budget would be within $200-300 per person.
* *Not entirely sure on the logistics of getting any catches that are able to be kept home haha if anyone has insight on that we'd love it!*
* I myself am not a big fisher and would not plan on joining whatever charter they decide on, so welcome any recommendations for a solo activity in town. Worst case I cross my fingers for decent weather and hang out reading my kindle somewhere with a coffee :)

**Day 6: 27th; Taking Alaska Railroad Costal Classic train to Anchorage.**

* We've booked to do the Major Marine 6 Hour Kenai Fjords National Park Glacier & Wildlife Cruise before leaving on the train. Will check out of hotel, check our luggage at the train depot, and then take the cruise before departing Seward at 6PM.
* *Any good breakfast spots/recommendations?*

**Day 7: 28th; Taking rental car from Anchorage to Talkeetna and staying the night.**

* Been told the Spinach bread in Talkeetna is a must try - but *I don't think they will be there as the State Fair is going on*? We'd be not far off from Palmer while driving to Talkeetna, *would it be worth stopping at the State Fair*?! We love the MN State Fair so might be kind of fun to try another state's!
* *If we don't stop at the State Fair, any recommendations on stops/side quests on the way to Talkeetna? Or should we aim to get to Talkeetna sooner and spend more time doing things there?*
* *Talkeetna recommendations?*

**Day 8: 29th; Driving Talkeetna to Fairbanks**

* Denali National Park stop? I've read you can drive to a certain part and then hop on a free shuttle/bus to get same/similar views as a booked tour, with the freedom to hop on/off and walk around a bit? If anyone has additional details or thoughts that would be amazing.
* *Any other recommendations on stops/side quests on the way to Fairbanks?*

**Day 9: 30th; Leave FAI at 10PM**

* Nothing concrete planned for the day other than checking out Santa Claus house at North Pole. Returning rental car and going to airport at 8PM.

Would also love any packing suggestions! We're MN natives, so we are used to cold and no stranger to rain and planning on waterproof jacket, pants, and shoes - though I'm trying to be hopeful we aren't going to just be getting dumped on the entire time we're there. I've read conflicting information about the back end of August in various parts of Alaska for weather, fingers crossed its not all doom and gloom haha. Are bugs still bad this time of year? Anything we're forgetting to think about? 

Really appreciate any insight/thoughts/recommendations/etc people are willing to share! Thank you so much! :)",1,1755458857.0,AskAlaska,1,1.0,False

  HARRY FINN ROSE as usual at six-thirty, made coffee, let the dog out into the fenced backyard for its morning constitutional, showered, shaved, woke the kids for school and oversaw that complicated operation for the next half hour as breakfasts were gulped, backpacks and shoes grabbed and arguments started and settled. His wife joined him, looking sleepy but nonetheless game for another day as a mother/chauffeur of three, including a precocious, independent-minded teenage boy.  
  
  Harry Finn was in his thirties with still boyish features and a pair of clear blue eyes that missed nothing. He’d married young and loved his wife and three children and even held sincere affection toward the family dog, a floppy-eared golden Labradoodle named George. Finn was an inch over six feet tall, with a long-limbed, wiry build ideally suited for speed and endurance. He was dressed in his usual faded jeans and shirttail-out clothing. And with round eyeglasses on and his intelligent, introspective expression, he looked like an accountant who enjoyed listening to Aerosmith after a day of crunching numbers. Although he was amazingly athletic, living by his wits was actually how he put bread on the table and iPods in his kids’ ears, and he was very good at his work. Indeed, there were very few people who could do what Harry Finn could. And live.  
  
  He kissed his wife good-bye, hugged his kids, even the teenager, grabbed a duffel bag that he’d placed near the front door the night before, slid into his Toyota Prius and drove to National Airport on the Potomac River right outside of Washington, D.C. Its official name had been changed to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, but to the locals it would be forever simply National. Finn parked in one of the lots near the main terminal building, whose chief architectural feature was a series of connected domes copied from Thomas Jefferson’s beloved Monticello. Bag in hand, he trudged across a skywalk into the sleek interior of the airport. Inside a restroom stall he opened his duffel, pulled on a heavy blue jacket with reflective stripes on the sleeves and a pair of blue workpants, slid a pair of orange noise mufflers around his neck and clipped the official-looking ID badge onto his jacket.  
  
  Employing a standard turnstile crash maneuver, he inserted himself into a herd of airport employees trekking through a “special” security line. Ironically, this line lacked even the cursory level of scrutiny forced on ordinary passengers. Once on the other side of the barrier he bought a cup of coffee and casually followed another airport worker through a secure door to the tarmac area. The man actually held the door open for him.  
  
  “What shift you working?” Finn asked the man, who told him.  
  
  “I’m just coming on,” Finn said. “Which would be okay if I hadn’t stayed up for the damn football game.”  
  
  “Tell me about it,” the man agreed.  
  
  Finn skittered down the metal steps and walked over to a 737 that was being prepped for a short-haul flight to Detroit with continuing service to Seattle. He passed several people along the way, including a fuel man, two baggage loaders and a mechanic inspecting the wheels of the Michigan-bound plane. No one confronted him because he looked and acted as though he had every right to be there. He made his way around the aircraft as he finished his coffee.  
  
  He next walked over to an Airbus A320 that would be on its way to Florida in about an hour. A baggage train was parked next to it. In one practiced motion, Finn pulled the small package from his jacket and slipped it into a side pocket of one of the bags stacked on the train. Then he knelt next to the plane’s rear wheels and pretended to check out its tire tread. Again, people around him took no notice because Harry Finn exuded an air of a man perfectly at home in his surroundings. A minute later he was chatting up one of the ground crew, analyzing the prospects of the Washington Redskins and the deplorable state of employment for those toiling in the aviation industry.  
  
  “Everyone except the head honchos,” Finn said. “Those bastards are printing money.”  
  
  “You got that right,” the other man said, and the two did a little knuckle smack to seal their solemn agreement on the disgusting greed of the rich and the ruthless who ruled the not-so-friendly skies.  
  
  Finn noted that the rear cargo hatch of the Detroit flight was now open. He waited until the handlers left with their train of luggage carts to fetch the bags and then climbed up on the lift parked there. He slipped into the cargo hold and inserted himself into his hiding place. He’d already picked it by studying interior cargo schematics of the 737 series, which were readily available if one knew where to look, and Finn clearly did. He’d also learned from open source research on the Internet that this plane was only going to be half full so his added weight in the rear would not be an issue.  
  
  While he lay curled in his hiding place the plane was loaded with fat bags and stressed passengers, and then it was wheels up to Detroit. Finn rode comfortably in the pressurized cargo hold, although it was a bit cooler here than in the main cabin and he was glad of the thick jacket he wore. About an hour after takeoff the plane landed and taxied to the gate. The cargo door was opened a few minutes later and the baggage offloaded. Finn patiently waited for a bit after the last bag was removed before he came out of concealment and peered through the open aft door. There were people around, but none looking his way. He climbed off the plane and dropped to the tarmac. A minute later he noticed a pair of security officers heading in his direction, sipping coffee and gabbing. He reached in his pocket, pulled out a lunch bag, took out a ham sandwich and began eating it as he walked away from the plane.  
  
  When the two guards passed him he nodded. “You regular coffee drinkers or is that half-caf caramel latte with a twist and four shots of who the hell knows what?” He grinned with his mouth full of ham sandwich. The two cops chuckled at his remark as he walked off.  
  
  He entered the terminal, went to a restroom, took off his jacket, ear mufflers and ID badge, made a quick phone call and marched to the airport security office.  
  
  “I put a bomb in a bag that was loaded onto an A320 at National Airport this morning,” he explained to the officer on duty. “And I just rode in the cargo hold of a 737 from D.C. I could’ve downed the plane anytime I wanted.”  
  
  The stunned officer was not wearing his weapon, so he leaped over the desk to tackle him. Finn neatly sidestepped this attack, and the fellow sprawled on the floor screaming for help. Other officers poured out of the back room and advanced on Finn, guns drawn. Yet Finn had pulled out his credentialing letter before the pistols had even appeared.  
  
  At that instant the door to the office flew open and three men strode in, their federal badges held high like the scepters of kings.  
  
  “Homeland Security,” one of the men barked at the guards. He pointed at Harry Finn. “This man works for us. And somebody’s in a shitload of trouble.”  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  “GREAT JOB, HARRY, as usual,” the head of the Homeland Security team said later, clapping Finn on the back. People had been screamed at and reports filed, e-mails fired off and cell phone batteries sucked dry as the clear lapses in airport security revealed by Harry Finn had been broadcast to all appropriate parties. Ordinarily, Finn would not have been tasked by the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS as it is commonly known, to execute an airport security breach because the FAA kept a stranglehold on that field. Finn suspected it was because the FAA boys were well aware of how many flaws there were in the system and didn’t want anyone outside their domain to realize it as well. However, folks at DHS had managed to get authorization to do this one, and picked him to pull the trigger.  
  
  Finn wasn’t an employee of DHS. The firm he worked for had been retained by the agency to test the security strength of  
both government and sensitive private facilities around the country. They did this using a hands-on, head-on approach: They tried to breach the places any way they could. DHS did a lot of this type of outsourcing. They had roughly a $40 billion annual budget and had to throw the money somewhere. Finn’s firm got a little out of this business, but then even a little slice of billions was a nice revenue stream.  
  
  Normally Finn would have left the airport without revealing what he’d done and let the chips fall. However, DHS, obviously fed up with the state of airport security and no doubt wanting to make a robust statement, had instructed him to go in and confess so they could dramatically storm in after him and make a big splash. The media would be salivating and the airline industry reeling, and Homeland Security would look very efficient and heroic. Finn never got in the middle of that. He did not give interviews and his name was never in the newspapers. He just quietly did his job.  
  
  He would conduct a follow-up briefing for the airport security personnel he’d just run rings around, trying to be both encouraging and diplomatic in assessing their performance or lack thereof and recommending changes in the future. Sometimes the briefing sessions were the most dangerous things he did. People could get very ticked off after finding out they’d been both snookered and embarrassed. In the past Finn literally had had to fight his way out of a room.  
  
  The DHS man added, “We’ll get these people in shape somehow, some way.”  
  
  “I’m not sure it’ll be in my lifetime, sir,” Finn said.  
  
  “You can wing it back to D.C. with us,” the man said. “We have an agency Falcon standing by.”  
  
  “Thanks, but I have someone here I’ve been meaning to visit. I’m going back tomorrow.”  
  
  “Right. Until next time.”  
  
  Until next time, Finn thought.  
  
  The men left and Finn rented a car and drove into the Detroit suburbs, stopping at a strip mall. From his knapsack he pulled out a map and a file with a photo in it. The man in the picture was sixty-three years of age, bald with several distinguishing tattoos, and went by the name Dan Ross.  
  
  It wasn’t his real name, but then neither was Harry Finn’s.  
  
  CHAPTER 3  
  
  ARTHRITIS. And on top of that the damn lupus. They were a lovely duo, perfectly synchronized to make his life a painfully throbbing hell. Every bone creaked, every solitary tendon shrieked. Each movement sent a mule kick right to his gut and yet he kept going, because if you stopped, you stopped for good. He downed a couple of potent pills he wasn’t supposed to have and plunked a ball cap on his hairless, pale-skinned head, pulling the brim low over his eyes and then donning sunglasses. He never liked people seeing what he was looking at. And he never wanted people to get a good look at him.  
  
  He eased himself into his car and drove to the store. Along the way the meds kicked in and he felt okay, or at least he would for a couple hours.  
  
  “Thank you, Mr. Ross,” the sales clerk said, glancing at the name on the credit card before handing it back along with his purchases. “You have a good day.”  
  
  “I don’t have good days anymore,” Dan Ross replied. “I only have days left.”  
  
  The clerk glanced at the hat covering the hairless head.  
  
  “Not cancer,” Ross said, reading the man’s thoughts. “Might be better if it was. Quicker, you know what I mean?”  
  
  The clerk, who was in his early twenties and of course still immortal, didn’t look like he knew what Ross meant at all. He gave an awkward nod and turned to help another customer.  
  
  Ross left the store and debated what to do next. He had no money worries. Uncle Sam had taken care of him in his old, busted-up age. Pension was first-rate, health care coverage gold-plated; that was one thing the feds did well. One of a short list was his opinion. Now he just had time. That was his chief concern. What now? Home to do nothing? Or lunch at the local deli where he could fill his belly, watch ESPN and flirt with the pretty waitresses who wouldn’t give him the time of day? Yet he could still dream, couldn’t he? Dream of the days when the ladies gave him far more than simply time.  
  
  Not much of a life, he had to admit. He thought this as his gaze discreetly eased in all directions. Even to this day he could not overcome the impulse to check whether he was being followed. You got that way when people were always trying to kill you. God, he had loved it, though. Beat the hell out of the deli-or-home bullshit debate every miserable day of this screwed-up dilemma playing out as his “golden” years. Over three decades ago he’d been in a different country every month. Every month during the busy season anyway. Seen the world on a wing, a prayer and a weapon of choice, he’d always said. He allowed himself a nostalgia-fueled smile. That’s all he had now, memories. And the damn lupus. I guess there is a God after all. Pretty damn shitty to find out now.  
  
  Unfortunately for Ross, while his observation skills were good, they were no longer infallible. Down the block in his rental car Harry Finn sat and studied the inimitable Mr. Ross. Where to, Danny? Home or the deli? Deli or home? What a long fall it’s been for you.  
  
  During the times Finn had observed this internal debate, Dan Ross had picked the deli over home about three-quarters of the time. This ratio held true today as he turned and walked down the street and into the Edsel Deli, going strong since 1954, the sign over the door said, making it far more popular than the dismal car after which it was named.  
  
  Ross would be in there eating and watching every move of the cute waitresses for at least an hour. Then it was twenty minutes by car back to his house. After that he would sit out in his backyard, read the newspaper, and then it was time to go in, take a nap, fix a modest dinner, watch TV, play Solitaire by the small table near the front window with the lamp illuminating the cards, and then the man would call it a night. By nine o’clock the lights in the small bungalow would go out, and Dan Ross would fall asleep and wake up the next day to do it all over again. Finn methodically counted off in his head these ticks of the older man’s threadbare life.  
  
  After Finn had tracked Ross to this town, he’d made several trips here to learn the man’s routine. This surveillance had enabled him to concoct the perfect plan to complete his task.  
  
  About five minutes before Ross would appear from the Edsel, Finn got out of his car, strode across the street, glanced in the window of the deli, and located Ross at his usual table in the rear, studying the bill he’d just been handed. Finn walked unhurriedly down the street to where Ross’ car was parked. In two minutes he was back in his rental. Three minutes after that Ross emerged from the restaurant, slowly edged down the street, climbed in his car and drove off.  
  
  Finn left in the opposite direction.  
  
  Ross went through his usual litany of triviality that evening, finishing it off with three fingers of Johnnie Walker Black and, ignoring all label warnings, combining it with a potent pop of meds for the pain. He barely made it to his bed before the paralysis set in. At first he assumed it was the drugs, and he actually welcomed the numbing feeling. Yet as he lay on the bed it occurred to him with slight panic that it might be the lupus moving to a higher, more aggressive stage. When he suddenly found it difficult to breathe he knew it was something else altogether. Heart attack? But where was the elephant on the chest, the shooting pain down the left arm? Stroke? He could still think, still talk. He said a few words and none of them constituted a mumble. His face didn’t seem lopsided. He had felt no pain beforehand, other than his usual. That was the problem; he could feel nothing in his limbs now, nothing at all. His gaze ran down his arm until it reached his left hand. He tried to rub the fingers together but his mind’s command apparently was not reaching the digits.  
  
  Yet earlier there had been something on his fingers. It had felt slick, like Vaseline. You could rub and rub and never get it to feel dry. He had washed his hands when he got home, and that seemed to do the trick. The fingers didn’t feel slick anymore. He didn’t know if it was due to the soap and water or to whatever it was having evaporated.  
  
  Then the truth hit him like a .50 caliber  
round. Or absorbed. As in absorbed into my body.  
  
  Where had his fingers become wet? He strained his mind to think. Not this morning. Not at the store, or the deli. After that? Perhaps. Getting in the car. The car handle! If he could have managed it, Ross would’ve sat up in a Eureka! moment. But he couldn’t manage it. He could now barely breathe. All that emitted from his mouth was a sort of shortened wheeze. The door handle of his car had been slicked with something that was now killing him. He eyed the phone on the nightstand. Two feet away and it might as well have been in China for all the good it would do him now.  
  
  In the darkness the figure appeared beside his bed. The man wore no disguise; Ross could make out his features even in the weak light. He was young and normal-looking. Ross had seen thousands of faces just like that and had paid little attention to any of them. His job had not involved normal; it had encompassed extraordinary. He couldn’t imagine how someone like this man had managed to kill him.  
  
  As Ross’ breathing became more labored, the fellow pulled something from his pocket and held it up to him. It was a photo, but Ross couldn’t make out who was in the picture. Realizing this, Harry Finn flicked on a small penlight and shone it on the photo. Ross’ gaze ran up and down the image. Still recognition didn’t come until Finn said the name.  
  
  “Now you know,” Finn said quietly. “Now you know.”  
  
  He put the photo away and stood silently looking down at Ross as the paralysis continued to wend its way through. He kept his gaze on the other man until the chest gave one last erratic heave and the pupils turned glassy.  
  
  Two minutes later Harry Finn was walking through the woods at the back of Ross’ house. The next morning he was on a plane, this time in the main cabin. He landed, drove home, kissed his wife, played with his dog and picked the kids up from school. That night they all went out to dinner to celebrate his youngest child, eight-year-old Susie, being named to portray a talking tree in a school play.  
  
  Around midnight, Harry Finn ventured downstairs to the kitchen, where George the faithful Labradoodle rose from his soft bed and greeted him. As he sat at the kitchen table and stroked the dog, Finn mentally crossed Dan Ross off his list.  
  
  Now he focused on the next name: Carter Gray, the former chief of America’s intelligence empire.  
  
  CHAPTER 4

ANNABELLE CONROY stretched out her long legs and watched the landscape drift by outside the window of the Amtrak Acela train car. She almost never took the train anywhere; her ride was typically at 39,000 feet where she popped peanuts, sipped watered-down seven-dollar cocktails, and dreamt up the next con. Today she was on the train because her companion, Milton Farb, would not set foot on anything that had the capacity and intent to leave the ground.  
  
  “Flying is the safest way to travel, Milton,” she’d informed him.  
  
  “Not if you’re on a plane that’s in a death spiral. Then your chances of dying are roughly one hundred percent. And I don’t like those odds.”  
  
  It was hard to argue with geniuses, Annabelle had discovered. Still, Milton, the man with the photographic memory and a budding talent for brilliantly lying to people, had done good work. They had left Boston after a successful job. The item was back where it needed to be and no one had thought to call the cops. In Annabelle’s world of high-stakes cons that was equal to perfection.  
  
  Thirty minutes later, as Amtrak’s only bullet train service wound its way down the East Coast and pulled into a station, Annabelle glanced out the window and involuntarily shuddered when the conductor announced they were arriving in Newark, New Jersey. Jersey was Jerry Bagger land, although thankfully the Acela train didn’t stop at Atlantic City where the maniacal casino boss had his empire. If it did Annabelle wouldn’t have been on it.  
  
  Yet she was smart enough to realize that Jerry Bagger had every motivation to leave Atlantic City and come looking for her wherever she might be. When you ripped a guy like that off for $40 million, assuming that Bagger would do his best to tear thousands of pieces of your flesh off one at a time was hardly irrational thinking.  
  
  She glanced over at Milton, who looked about eighteen with his boyish face and longish hair. In reality the man was pushing fifty. He was on his computer, doing something that neither Annabelle nor anyone else below the level of genius would be able to understand.  
  
  Bored, Annabelle rose, went to the café car and purchased a beer and a bag of chips. On the way back she spied a New York Times lying discarded on one of the café tables. She sat down on a stool, drank her beer and munched her chips as she idly turned the pages looking for that one bit of information that might spark her next adventure. Once she got back to Washington, D.C., she had some decisions to make, chiefly whether to stay put or flee the country. She knew what her answer should be. A no-name island in the South Pacific was the safest place for her right now, where she could just wait out the tsunami named Jerry. Bagger was in his mid-sixties and her long con against him had without a doubt considerably raised the man’s blood pressure. With a little luck he’d soon croak from a heart attack and she would be scot-free. However, she couldn’t count on that. With Jerry you just had to figure that all your luck would turn out to be bad.  
  
  It shouldn’t have been a difficult decision and yet it was. She had grown close, or as close as someone like her could get, to an oddball collection of men who called themselves the Camel Club. She smiled to herself as she thought about the foursome, one of whom was named Caleb Shaw and worked at the Library of Congress. He reminded her remarkably of the cowardly lion from The Wizard of Oz. Then her smile faded. Oliver Stone, the head of this little band of miscreants, was something altogether more. He must’ve had one hell of a past, Annabelle thought—a history that might even surpass hers in the unusual and extraordinary department, and that was saying something. She didn’t know if she could say good-bye to Oliver Stone. She doubted she would ever run across another one like him.  
  
  Her gaze flicked up at a young man passing by who did not attempt to hide his admiration for her tall, curvy figure, long blonde hair, and thirty-six-year-old face that, if it didn’t actually hit the “wow” level, came awfully close. This was so despite a small, fishhook-shaped scar under her eye; a present from her father, Paddy Conroy, the best short con artist of his generation, and the world’s worst father, at least in his only child’s estimation.  
  
  “Hey,” the young man said. With his lean physique, tousled hair and expensive clothes that were designed to appear cheap and grungy, he looked like an Abercrombie & Fitch ad. She quickly sized him up as a privileged college kid with far more money than was healthy and the insufferably cocky attitude to match.  
  
  “Hey back at you,” she said and returned to her newspaper.  
  
  “Where you headed to?” he asked, sitting down next to her.  
  
  “Not where you’re headed.”  
  
  “But you don’t know where I’m going,” he said in a playful tone.  
  
  “That’s sort of the point, right?”  
  
  He either didn’t get her point or didn’t care. “I go to Harvard.”  
  
  “Wow, I never would’ve guessed that.”  
  
  “But I’m from Philly. The Main Line. My parents have an estate there.”  
  
  “Wow again. It’s nice to have parents who have estates,” she said in a clearly uninterested tone.  
  
  “It’s also nice to have parents who are out of the country half the time. I’m having a little party there tonight. It’s going to be a wild ride. You interested?”  
  
  Annabelle could feel the guy’s gaze running down her. Okay, here we go again. She knew she shouldn’t, but with guys like this she just couldn’t seem to help herself.  
  
  She closed the newspaper. “I don’t know. When you say wild, how wild do you mean?”  
  
  “How wild do you want it to be?” She could see him forming the word “baby,” but he apparently thought better of using it, at least so soon in the conversation.  
  
  “I hate being disappointed.”  
  
  He touched her arm. “I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.”  
  
  She smiled and patted his hand. “So what are we talking about here? Booze and sex?”  
  
  “A given.” He squeezed her arm. “Hey, I’m up in first class, why don’t you join me?”  
  
  “You have anything other than booze and sex going on?”  
  
  “You like to get into the details?”  
  
  “It’s all in the details, uh . . .”  
  
  “Steve. Steve Brinkman.” He gave a practiced little chuckle. “You know, one of those Brinkmans. My father’s the vice chairman of one of the biggest banks in the country.”  
  
  “FYI, Steve, if you’ve just got coke at this party, and I’m not talking the soft drink, that would definitely disappoint me.”  
  
  “What are you looking for? I’m sure I can get it. I’ve got connections.”  
  
  “Goofballs, Dollies, Hog, with artillery to do it right, and no lemonade, lemonade always pisses me off,” she added, referring to crap-quality drugs.  
  
  “Wow, you know your stuff,” Steve said, nervously looking around at the other people in the café car.  
  
  “You ever chased the dragon, Steve?” she asked.  
  
  “Uh, no.”  
  
  “It’s a funky way to inhale heroin. It’ll give you the greatest pop in the world, if it doesn’t kill you.”  
  
  He removed his hand from her arm. “Doesn’t sound very smart.”  
  
  “How old are you?”  
  
  “Twenty. Why?”  
  
  “I like my men a little younger than that. I find that when a guy reaches eighteen he’s left his best ball-banging behind. So you gonna have any minors at this party?”  
  
  He rose. “Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea.”  
  
  “Oh, I’m not picky. It can be guys or girls. I mean, when you’re shit-faced on meth, who cares?”  
  
  “Okay, I’m leaving now,” Steve said hurriedly.  
  
  “One more thing.” Annabelle took out her wallet and flashed a fake badge at him. She said in a low voice, “You recognize the DEA insignia, Steve? For Drug Enforcement Agency?

One of my huskies likes to stick his head through a hole in the fence, usually to watch and talk to the squirrels, bunnies, or neighbors' dog. He hadn't moved or made a sound and I was halfway through my coffee, so I stood up to see what in the world he was so fixated on. And there was a gorgeous red fox! He or she looks very healthy and was munching on the dropped bird seed and suet from the feeders. At some point, my pup jumped on the fence and startled the poor thing and they bounded off into the little wilderness area behind the house. It was just a really nice way to start the day :)",34,1755458795.0,foxes,0,1.0,False

I would like to point into a specific topic, which is oxalate dumping.

I am familiarized with the work of naturopath Eliot Overturn from EONutrition channel, which he talks about oxalates in plants, their tendency to accumulate in the various tissues in the body and the consequence of vastly limiting the amount of oxalates intake through varied sources.

There are many studies, which are made public, to be shown in the pubmed, but I could not find any specific evidence to this process which would actually specifically point to the fact that indeed the body is releasing oxalate crystals through the internal detoxifying process.

Due to my own allergic symptoms which could be related to the coffee and tea consumption - general itchiness on the face and mostly on the nose, pain in the maxillary incisor teeth which radiates to my sinuses and increased mucus production, which comes in a subsequent action, one symptom going into another, I am generally intrigued by the idea of oxalates damaging effect.

Have You found any connection with how your days go when You are having some oxalate rich food, and could it coincidentally be correlated with the usual histamine symptoms?

I admit that the topic of histamine intolerance is truly complicated and may consist of many different datapoints, including even mold.

Oxalates and oxalate dumping though sounds like something that could be pinpointed to the histamine intolerance, but it is truly hard to connect these two, as oxalate crystals would have to be big enough to be identified in the days of dumping, which is something that makes the general idea less credible.

That is why I ask for Your opinion,

1mt02w5,https://ithappensinflorida.com/blog/when-writers-block-happens-florida,When Writer’s Block Happens in Florida,"It finally happened. John—fearless producer, creative engine, and blog-writing wizard behind It Happens in Florida—hit a wall.

A big one.

No words. No inspiration. No quirky metaphors. Just a blank screen, a blinking cursor, and a rapidly cooling cup of gas station coffee.

Sensing his distress (or maybe just bored between takes), the cast and crew rallied to “help” him break the dreaded writer’s block. What followed was a brainstorming session so uniquely Floridian that we had to call our legal team three separate times just to make sure we couldn’t be arrested for even thinking about some of the suggestions.

Here are just a few actual (and completely unpublishable) ideas pitched by our team of very supportive lunatics:

Oscar’s Idea:

“What if we do a blog post entirely from the perspective of a raccoon that lives in a vending machine behind a Waffle House?”

Denied. We’re not ready for that kind of emotional journey. Also, legal said something about “implied defamation of raccoons.”

Raymond’s Idea:

“How about a blog written underwater, live, while noodling for catfish using nothing but hot dog buns and regret?”

Denied. Mostly because John can’t swim and hot dog buns aren’t OSHA compliant.

Jenna from Makeup:

“We just list all the weird things people have tried to mail in Florida—live pythons, a taxidermy goat, three gallons of queso. Bonus points if it’s shaped like the state.”

Tempting. Still denied. The post office already has us on a watch list.

Boom Mic Cal:

“A blog post that’s just a treasure map to an actual buried cooler of Four Loko and expired shrimp.”

We stopped taking notes at “expired shrimp.” Denied. Immediately.

Local Extra #17:

“You ever see a man wrestle a leaf blower during a hurricane and win? I have. Write about that.”

We believe you. And we’re deeply afraid.

In the end, John stared down the chaos, the brainstorm board covered in alligator stickers, and the Google Doc full of terrible puns about manatees in politics—and he did what any great Florida storyteller does:

He wrote a blog post about not being able to write a blog post.

Because when all else fails in Florida, you just embrace the madness and hit “publish.”

Stay tuned for next week’s post, assuming no one gets arrested for following the aforementioned treasure map. Again.",1,1755458755.0,It_Happens_in_Florida,0,1.0,False

[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1mrbwf6/im_a_trucker_on_a_highway_that_doesnt_exist_i/)

As you might remember, I ended my last post with a delightfully heroic announcement. I was going to save Tiff, defy the road, and risk my very life to do so. As befits the commencement of any noble quest, I started my journey in the same way as any fearless hero.

I tried to get somebody else to do the work for me.

“Randall―” I began.

“I get the impression you're about to say something I won't like.”

“―we need to rescue the stranded truckers.”

“Thought so.”

“There has to be something we can do to get them out. Tiff doesn’t even have a vehicle anymore. She says her old one broke down, but maybe we can haul her a car.”

“We’re not in the business of handing free cars to non-employees.”

“I’ll buy it,” I said.

“Maybe she can share with Al.” The *other* driver stuck on Route 333. The one still driving.

“This isn't funny.”

“Of course, it isn't funny!” Randall slammed his hands on the desk and shot to his feet. “I find nothing humorous in you messing with things you have no idea about.”

“Maybe if you answered more of my questions, I *would* have more of an idea! You don’t get to hand us an obscure employee handbook then expect us to be good little soldier boys who follow your every order without ever giving us any explanations at all.""

“Yes, actually. I do get to expect that. That’s what the extremely generous salary is for.”

“Oh shove off. Money doesn’t let you treat us like crap.”

“Oh?”

I think it was his smirk that did it. Randall was fuming as much as me, but he still managed a satisfied smile as if to say, *You’re stuck. You know it. You won’t leave.* And he was right. Nowhere else paid this well, not for a college grad. I’d moved my whole life to California. I absolutely couldn’t go back now…

But that smirk.

“Find a new driver.” I stormed out of the office.

For any of you who’ve fantasized about doing the exact same thing at your current job, I can assure you it feels every bit as good as you imagined and more. I kept expecting the horror of what I’d done to hit, but it didn’t. Instead, I seethed on my drive home. I seethed as I heated up dinner in the microwave, and I seethed as I went to bed. 

It had been so long since I’d cared about anything, that I forgot how strong it could feel.

I woke up at one AM to a screaming cell phone.

Those of you who’ve read this far have probably noticed my attempts at sleep often get interrupted―faceless men watching me, exes licking my face, the likes. If you’re bored of this repeated occurrence, I’d just like to add my signature to that ballot. At what age did eight hours of healthy sleep become such a wildly unrealistic request?

I was so groggy I didn’t even bother to check the caller ID before picking up. Big mistake.

“We need you to come in,” Randall said. “*Now*.”

“It’s the middle of the night.”

“This is an emergency.”

I cussed him out. “If you’ll remember, I quit less than ten hours ago.”

“You're not still going on about that are you? You didn't quit. You just stormed out. Look, I apologize for whatever it is that made you so ticked earlier, alright? We good? Now, stop throwing a fit and get yourself to the terminal.”

“I'm not coming in.”

I hung up on him mid-sentence.

If I weren’t so tired that probably would have felt almost as phenomenal as walking out. At least until the point that Randall called again. 

I declined. He called again. I declined. He called―I kid you not―twelve more times. *Twelve.* Probably, I should have blocked him at that point, but I still wasn’t thinking straight. The thirteenth time, I finally picked back up.

“Stop!”

“*Please*.” Randall’s tone was different now. He’d lost his usual superior edge. There was only desperation. “Brendon, this isn’t a game. Come in tonight, right now, and I'll include a ten thousand dollar bonus on your next paycheck.”

My finger hovered above the hang-up button. “Not a bonus,” I said. “A yearly raise.”

“That's not how promotions work here.”

“It wouldn't be a promotion. You would be rehiring me. I already quit remember?”

Randall cussed me out. It felt good to hear him so undeniably lose his cool. “Fine! You win. You’ll get your rehiring bonus. Just come in.” His tone lowered. “Okay, but we're not really redoing the paperwork for you to be fired and rehired. That's just excessive.""

“It is.”

Did I feel like a sell-out? A little. But at least Randall was pissed. My grand defiance for authority had lasted barely eight hours, and I now knew my ego was worth a scant ten grand―more than I’d thought actually.

Student loans really are no joke.

As soon as I reached the truck yard, Randall handed me a cup of coffee and a set of keys.

“The trailer’s already hooked up. You don’t even need to take it far tonight, just get it onto Route 333, and then you can sleep for a few hours if you want.”

“Where am I going?”

Randall exhaled. He handed me a map, something he’d never done before (I hadn't even known maps of Route 333 existed), and showed me where I was headed.

“But that’s at least five days from here. That’s a ten day haul. I only brought one set of clothes.”

“I threw some of mine in the cab.” When I tried to interrupt, he held up his hand. “And *yes,* it’s one with AC.”

There was that at least.

“What’s in the trailer?” I asked.

He didn’t even respond, just raised an eyebrow, back to his usual condescending self. That was fair I supposed. I *had* agreed to take the job again, and I knew the rules. No peeking.

Obviously, I’d asked the other drivers about what we were hauling. They were more than happy to offer up knowledge like best pullouts for a quick nap, what diners fried the best bacon, and how to avoid running into the things with zippers on their stomachs. Any time I tried asking about our cargo though?

The mood changed. Their faces darkened. They sobered.

“Sometimes not knowing a secret can drive you mad,” Deidree confided in me once, “but sometimes it's knowing the secret that does it. In this job, you have to figure out which it is.”

I didn’t trust that management always had our best interests in mind, but I did trust the other drivers. I gave up asking what we were hauling. I let myself stop wondering. If I could live with not knowing that probably meant it was the latter of Deidree’s options: finding out would be the worse alternative.

That night though, driving through massive redwoods beneath a starry sky, I wasn’t sure. The not knowing. The *wondering*. It was going to kill me.

I was so distracted, it took me almost by surprise when my rig sputtered, slowed then stopped. By now, I knew to expect this interruption. It happened every trip down Route 333. The exact location would vary, but it always happened in the redwood section. 

Per usual, I clicked start on the stopwatch I’d begun carrying. Somewhere around a minute fifty-five, I stopped it. There was no point in keeping track of the time anymore.

I already knew I’d been stalled for too long.

*Control your breath. Don’t panic. Close your eyes. Hide.* 

This hadn't happened since my interview, but I’d always known this was a possibility. The other drivers talked about multiple minute time outs happening to them, and none of them had ever gotten hurt. All I had to do was crouch in between my seat and the sleeper bed, shut my eyes, and ignore the very real fact that these things had my scent.

The footsteps began. They scurried around my rig. Occasionally, things would tap or knock on the metal. Something yanked at the door handles. They stayed shut. At one point the entire truck shuddered as if a dozen bodies were slamming themselves against one side in an attempt to tip it. The truck stayed put.

It would get worse I knew. That’s what had happened the first time. The footsteps had increased steadily, until I could hear nothing else, and then the engine had started― except the footsteps didn’t get worse. Instead, the scurrying calmed down. 

The forest dwellers were still out there. I could hear the pitter of feet, but it was calmer, less frantic. Was this some sort of a trick? Did they think I couldn’t hear them and would open my eyes?

A moment later I knew that theory was wrong. They weren’t trying to hide. They were trying to quiet down enough to speak with me. 

“Give it to us.”

The voice wasn’t a voice exactly. It was the rustle of leaves, the snap of branches underfoot, and the tinkle of windchimes, all somehow combined in a way that formed words.

I held my breath.

“We smell you, He Who Dwells on Stone. Your odor has presented itself here once before, in our domain. We demand an audience.”

I kept still. Was there anything in the employee handbook about actually speaking with them? I didn’t think so, but maybe I’d missed it. *Maybe you should really read the whole thing, Brendon.*

The strange not-voice seemed to sigh. “Speak with us, or we slash your tires.”

A pretty convincing argument in my opinion. “What do you want?” I asked.

“The thing you carry in your moving device. Relinquish possession of it to us.”

“Interesting proposition. Unfortunately, the cargo isn’t really mine to begin with, so I’m not really in a position to hand anything over. I’m sure you understand.”

“Relinquish it, and we will allow you open passage through our lands for the rest of your travels. Do not, and we will tear apart your machine.” *Also* a pretty convincing argument.

“What is it?” I asked.

“That is not an answer one life force may give another.”

“K, so like you don’t know.”

“Of course we know,” the thing said defensively.

“Really? Because it sounds like you’re bluffing right now.”

“*We know!*” 

The thing calmed itself down. “Relinquish your load and we will allow passage to all of your kind for the next generation.”

I remembered the man skewered on the hood of his truck. These things weren’t bluffing. They could kill us and *easily* too. How many people would I save over a generation if I agreed?

And yet…

I didn’t know what was in my cargo, but I did know these things killed humans for merely looking at them. If they wanted my haul, it couldn’t be for anything good.  

So I did the only thing I could think to do. I stalled.

“How about a clue?” I asked. “Surely, you can give me a clue of what I’m hauling.”

It couldn’t, it informed me. So I pushed. The thing got more and more frustrated. I got more and more anxious. The footsteps grew restless again. They began circling my truck, looking for a way in. One of them―I got the impression it was the one speaking to me― scratched at the door. It slammed against the window. The sound of cracking glass.

“You are merely attempting to waste our time,” the forest thing accused.

“That is the plan. Yes.”

It slammed the glass again. More cracking. *Bad. Real bad.*

I could practically sense the creature drawing back, preparing for a third and final strike, about to break in―

The engine roared to life. I whooped and scrambled for the front. Just before I uncovered my eyes though, I realized the footsteps were still there, circling my truck. 

They hadn't left.

I didn’t consider. I didn’t allow myself time to think up a secondary plan. I just leapt into my seat, threw the car in drive, and slammed my foot on the gas―all without looking. 

The truck lurched forward. I forced my eyes to stay closed for *two, four, six* seconds, before letting them spring open. A turn was coming up. I jerked the wheel to the left but not in time to avoid the low hanging branches that battered against my front windshield. I retook control, never slowing once, and never glancing in the rearview.

I'd escaped. 

It was only a couple hours later, when I was well into the desert and far enough to feel comfortable, that I finally pulled to the side of the road to survey the damage. The driver window had splinters running through it. There were dents along the skirt of the freight carrier, but it was otherwise intact.

I circled to the back to make sure everything was still locked and secure. It was.

*Everything’s fine. Get some sleep. You’re fine.* 

And then, as often happens just after the movie protagonist says, “It’s all good, guys,” I was immediately disabused of my delusions of safety.

Something was crying.

I pressed my ear to the metal of the freight. Sure enough, inside the container, faint but audible, was a little girl’s sobs.

“Hello?” I asked. “Do you need help?”

The crying cut off. I waited another ten minutes with my ears pressed to the container, but the crying never started again. The thing stayed silent.

It would have been easy. For the sake of my sanity, I could have chalked it up to imagination. I was sleep deprived and in shock, and of course I’d heard crying. It was my own inner child acting out from revulsion at this entire stressful situation. That’s what it was.

But it wasn’t.

I’d learned something, though *what* I now knew, I wasn’t totally sure. Was the thing in the cargo bay a person? A creature? A child?

1mt00cc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mt00cc/sixth_grave_on_the_edge_novel_by_darynda_jones/,Sixth Grave on the Edge Novel by Darynda Jones Free Read online,"A girl, a mocha latte, and a naked dead man walk into a bar,” I said, turning to the naked dead man sitting in my passenger seat. The elderly naked dead man who’d been riding shotgun in my cherry red Jeep Wrangler, aka Misery, for two days now. We were on a stakeout. Sort of. I was staking out a Mr. and Mrs. Foster, so I was definitely on a stakeout. No idea what Naked Dead Man was on. Considering the fact that he looked about 112, probably blood thinners. Cholesterol medication. And, judging from the state of his manhood, which I couldn’t stop seeing every single time I turned toward him, Viagra. If I were to hashtag that moment, my status would read something like #impressed.  
  
  I gave him two thumbs up, then looked back at the house again, happy to be sitting in Misery. The Jeep, not the emotion. I’d just picked her up from the car hospital two days earlier. She’d had several surgeries to fix her broken girlie bits because a raving lunatic rammed into her. He’d knocked her into a state of mangled disrepair and me, as I was in the driver’s seat at the time, into a state of oblivion. I stayed in that state long enough for Mr. Raving Lunatic to cart me off to a deserted bridge to kill me. He failed and died in the process, but Misery had paid a high price for his nefarious machinations. Why did bad guys always try to hurt the ones I loved?  
  
  And this one had succeeded. Misery was hurt. Bad. No one wanted to work on her. Said she couldn’t be saved. Said to give her over to the scrap yard. Thankfully, a family friend with a body shop and a few incriminating photos, which just happened to have found their way into my possession, agreed with great reluctance to try.  
  
  Noni kept her for two long weeks before calling to tell me that he’d almost lost her a couple of times, but she’d pulled through with flying colors. When I got the green light to go pick her up, I tore out of my apartment so fast, I left a dust trail behind me, along with a flummoxed best friend, who’d been telling me about the couple in 3C. They were apparently newlyweds, if their energy to do it—her words—all night every night was any indication. I hurried back to her, however, because I didn’t have a car and I needed a ride.  
  
  When we picked up Misery, Noni tried to tell me everything he’d had to do to her to get her up and running, but I held up a hand to stop him, unable to bear it. This was Misery he was talking about. Not some random Wrangler off the streets. This was my Wrangler. My best friend. My baby.  
  
  Holy cow, I needed a life.  
  
  I had to hand it to Noni, though. Misery was good as new. Better than I was, anyway. Ever since that night, I’d been having problems sleeping. I suffered from debilitating nightmares that left me screaming into my pillow, and I jumped every time someone dropped a feather.  
  
  But at least Misery was okay. Like, really okay. It was weird. Her cough was gone. Her sluggish response time was no longer an issue. Her reluctance to wake up in the mornings as she sputtered in protest every time I tried to fire all engines was nonexistent. Now she started on the first try, no groaning or whining, and she purred like a newborn kitten. How Noni had managed to fix her insides as well as her outsides I’d never know, but the guy was good. And Noni was my new best friend. Well, after Misery. And Cookie, my real best friend. And Garrett, my kind of, sort of best friend. And Reyes, my … my …  
  
  What was Reyes? Besides the dark and sultry son of evil? My boy toy? My love slave? My 24/7 booty call?  
  
  No.  
  
  Well, yes.  
  
  He was all those things, but he was also my almost fiancé. All I had to do was say yes to the proposal he’d written on a sticky note, and he would be my fiancé for reals. Until then, however, he was my almost fiancé.  
  
  No, my soon-to-be fiancé.  
  
  No! My nigh fiancé.  
  
  Yeah, that’d work.  
  
  I turned back to the naked dead man, stuffed a couple of Cheez-Its into my mouth, and confessed my latest sin.  
  
  “I’m just kidding,” I said through the crackers, regretting the fact that I’d tempted him and now had no follow-up. No punch line. “I don’t know any ‘girl, mocha latte, dead man’ jokes. Sorry to get your hopes up like that.” He didn’t seem to mind, however. He sat staring straight ahead as always, his gray eyes clouded and watery with age, oblivious of my charm, my clever repartee, and my intellectual wit. He was ignoring me!  
  
  It happened.  
  
  “Cheez-It?” I offered him.  
  
&nbs  
p; Nothing.  
  
  “Okay, but you have no idea what you’re missing here.”  
  
  I could only hope that one day he’d actually talk to me; otherwise, this was going to be a very one-sided relationship. I dusted Cheez-It gunk off my hands and went back to a drawing I’d been working on. Since he didn’t talk, I had no way of finding out his identity. And in my attempt to avoid eye contact with Naked Dead Man’s penis over the last couple of days, I’d also avoided several key clues as to said identity. First, he had a long scar that ran from under his left arm, over his rib cage, and down until it ended at his belly button. Whatever had caused it couldn’t be pleasant, but it could be vital in identifying him. Second, he had a tattoo on his left biceps that looked very old-school military. It was faded and the ink had spread, but I could still make out an eagle with its talons gripping a United States flag. And third, right underneath his tattoo was a surname, presumably his: ANDRULIS. I’d taken out my memo pad and pen and was drawing the tat, since I had yet to find a camera that could photograph the departed.  
  
  I did my darnedest to draw the tat while simultaneously balancing the Cheez-It box against the gearshift, within arm’s reach, and keeping an eye on the Fosters’ house. Sadly, I sucked at two out of three of those tasks. Mostly at drawing. I’d never gotten the hang of it. I failed finger painting in kindergarten, too. That should have been a clue, but I’d always wanted to be the next Vermeer or Picasso or, at the very least, the next Clyde Brewster, a boy I’d went to school with who drew exploding walls and houses and buildings. No idea why. Alas, my destiny did not lie within the lines of graphite or the strokes of a paintbrush, but at the whim of dead people with PTDD: post-traumatic death disorder.  
  
  Oh, well. It could have been worse. Clyde Brewster, for example, ended up in prison for trying to blow up a Sack-N-Save. Thankfully, he was better at art than at demolitions. He’d asked me out several times, too. #Dodgedabullet.  
  
  “I know you’re not really into baring your soul,” I said, eyeing Mr. Andrulis’s bare, naked soul, “figuratively speaking, but if there’s anything you want or need, I’m your girl. Mostly because not many people on Earth can see you.”  
  
  I added a shadow on the eagle’s face with my blue ink pen, trying to make it look noble. It didn’t help. It still looked cross-eyed.  
  
  “And those who can see the departed usually see only a gray mist where you might be. Or they’ll feel a rush of cold air when you walk past. But I can see you, touch you, hear you, pretty much anything you.”  
  
  Maybe if I added highlights on its beak, it would look more like an eagle and less like a duck.  
  
  “My name is Charley.”  
  
  But I was using a pen. I couldn’t erase. Damn it. I had to think ahead. Real artists thought ahead. I’d never get into the Louvre at this rate.  
  
  “Charley Davidson.”  
  
  I tried to scratch off some of the ink, bracing the memo pad against my steering wheel. I tore a tiny hole in the paper instead and cursed under my breath.  
  
  “I’m the grim reaper,” I said from between gritted teeth, “but don’t let that bother you. It’s not as bad as it sounds. I’m also a private investigator. That’s not as bad as it sounds either. And I shouldn’t have given your eagle eyelashes. He looks like Daffy Duck in drag.”  
  
  Giving up, I wrote the name underneath the eagle-ish-type drawing, consoling myself with the fact that abstract art was all the rage before pulling out my phone and snapping a shot of my masterpiece. After angling it this way and that, trying to get the focus just right, I realized the eagle looked better when turned on its side. More masculine. Less … water fowl.  
  
  I saved the best one and deleted the rest as a car pulled up to the Foster house. A nervous thrill rushed up my spine. I put down my pen and memo pad and took a sip of my whipped mocha latte, forcing myself to calm as I waited to see who was driving the gold Prius. I was spying on the Fosters, who lived in a modest neighborhood in the Northeast Heights, because I’d been asked to by a friend of mine. She was a special agent with the FBI, like her father before her, and this had been his case, one of the few that went unsolved under his watch. I was trying to help her solve it, though solving might be a strong word. If my hunch was correct, and I liked to think it was, I had insider information that my friend’s father was never privy to. Mr. Foster owned an insurance company, and Mrs. Foster ran the office of a local pediatrician. And approximately thirty years ago, their son was taken from them, never to be seen again. I was about 100 percent certain I knew what happened to him.  
  
  I eased forward and pressed against the steering wheel, angling for a better look at the driver when my aunt Lil’s voice wafted toward me from the backseat.  
  
  “Who’s the hottie?” she asked, her blue hair and floral muumuu solidifying around her as she materialized in my rearview.  
  
  I tossed a wink over my right shoulder. “Hey, Aunt Lil. How was your trip to Bangladesh?”  
  
  “Oh, the food!” She waved a hand extravagantly. “The people! I was in heaven, I tell ya. Not literally, though.” She cackled in delight at her joke.  
  
  Aunt Lil had died in the ’60s, a fact she’d only recently discovered. So, she couldn’t have actually eaten or interacted with the native population. At least, not the living native population. I’d never thought about her visiting the departed when she traveled. Now, that would be fascinating.  
  
  She hitched a thumb toward my newest friend and wriggled her penciled brows. “You gonna introduce us?”  
  
  The garage door rose and the driver pulled inside but didn’t close the door. It gave me hope. I just wanted a glimpse. A tiny peek.  
  
  “He’s not very talkative,” I said, squinting for a better view when the driver’s-side door opened, “but I think his last name is Andrulis. It’s on his tattoo.”  
  
  “He’s got some ink?” She leaned forward and spotted Mr. A’s package. It was hard to miss.  
  
  “Good heavens,” she said, her eyes rounding in appreciation.  
  
  Before I could get a look at the driver, the garage door started closing. “Darn,” I whispered, tilting my head in unison with the descending door until it completely blocked my view.  
  
  I’d seen a woman’s foot as she stepped out of the car before the door closed completely. That was about it.  
  
  “He’s certainly been blessed,” she said.  
  
  I laid my head against the steering wheel and expelled a loud breath as disappointment washed over me. I’d been handed a file that could hold many answers to the puzzle that was Reyes Alexander Farrow, my nigh fiancé, and the Fosters were a big piece of the puzzle. Their first son had been kidnapped while napping in his room. Because there was never a ransom demand and no witnesses, the trail went cold almost immediately despite a massive search and public pleas from the parents. But the FBI agent assigned to the case never gave up. He’d always believed there was more to the case than just a kidnapping. And so did his daughter. We’d worked a couple of cases together in the past. She knew about my rep for solving difficult crimes, and she’d asked me to look at this cold case that had been the bane of her father’s existence.  
  
  And that was the day that Reyes Farrow’s kidnapping fell into my lap. He was the child who had been abducted almost thirty years prior. I glanced down at the file stuffed between my seat and the console. So much potential there. So much heartache.  
  
  “Don’t you think?”  
  
  I blinked back to Aunt Lil. “Think what?”  
  
  “That he’s been blessed.”  
  
  “Oh, yeah, I do.” I couldn’t help another glance. “But it’s just so … there. So unavoidable.” I tore my gaze away and pointed to his tat. “So, the name Andrulis. Does that ring any bells?”  
  
  “No, but I can do some investigating. See what turns up. Speaking of which, I have an idea I want to run past you.”  
  
  I shifted around so I could see her better. “Shoot.”  
  
  “I think we should work together.” She jammed a bony elbow into my side encouragingly, her arm passing through the seat to poke me.  
  
  “Oo  
ooh-kay,” I said with a light chuckle.  
  
  “Ha! I knew it was a good idea.” Her face brightened, the grayish tones of life after death lightening just a little.  
  
  It could work. We could be the Dynamic Duo. Only without capes, sadly enough. I’d always wanted to do good deeds in a red cape. Or, at the very least, a mauve towel.  
  
  After taking another sip of my now lukewarm mocha latte—which was better than no mocha latte any day of the week—I asked, “Are you planning to draw a salary?”  
  
  “The way I see it, we should split the take fifty–fifty.”  
  
  I stifled a grin. “That’s the way you see it, huh?”  
  
  “Oh, and we probably need code names.”  
  
  Her suggestion made me choke on my next sip. “Code names?” I asked through the coughs.  
  
  “And code phrases like, ‘The sun never sets in the east.’ That could mean, ‘Switch to plan B.’ Or it could mean, ‘Let’s grab a bite to eat before the men come over.’”  
  
  “The men?” She’d really thought this through.  
  
  “Or it could mean, ‘How do you get blood out of silk?’ Because as PIs, we’ll need to know stuff like that.”  
  
  “I’m sure you’re right.” The file caught my attention again, and I turned back to the Foster house. “Blood can be stubborn.” Maybe I should just walk up and knock on the door. I could say I was helping a friend with an old case. I could ask if there were any new developments we hadn’t been informed of. I could ask if they knew that the man recently released from prison after doing ten years for a crime he didn’t commit was their son. I could ask if they knew what he’d been through, what he’d suffered at the hands of the man who raised him. But what good would adding guilt on top of guilt do anybody?  
  
  “Are you okay, pumpkin cheeks?”  
  
  I shook out of my thoughts. “Yeah, it’s just … well, two hours down the drain, and for what?” I gestured toward the Fosters’ house. “A foot in a sensible shoe driving a sensible car.”  
  
  She looked across the street toward the house. “What were you hoping to see?

Her question took me by surprise. Even I wondered what I was really doing there. Did I simply want to see the woman who might have given birth to the man of my dreams? Did I want a glimpse of the man who may have been his human father?  
  
  Reyes was the son of Satan, forged in the fires of hell, but he’d been born on earth to be with me. To grow up with me. He’d done his homework and chose a steady, professional couple to be his human parents. He’d planned for us to go to the same schools, shop at the same stores, and eat at the same restaurants. Sadly, even the best-laid plans go awry.  
  
  “I’m not really sure, Aunt Lil.” What had I been hoping to see? A glimpse of Reyes’s past? Of his future? What he would look like in the years to come? Since it had been only a few days since a crazy man tried to kill me, I was trying not to rush terribly headlong into any situation, no matter how innocuous it might seem on the surface. I’d decided to take the week off. Reckless behavior would just have to wait until I’d healed a tad more.  
  
  “Goodness, that won’t do. You can’t just call me Aunt Lil willy-nilly. We’ll definitely need code names. What do you think of Cleopatra?”  
  
  I chuckled softly. “I think it’s perfect.”  
  
  “Oh! Trench coats! We’ll need trench coats!”  
  
  “Trench coats?”  
  
  “And fedoras!”  
  
  Before I could question her further, she was gone. Vanished. Vamoosed. I loved that woman. She took eccentric to a whole new level. Still, I had work to do, and sitting at a stakeout just to catch a glimpse of the Fosters was ridiculous. I started Misery, then picked up the Cheez-Its and stuffed a handful into my mouth the very second the phone rang. Naturally. Because when else would it ring?  
  
  I hurried and chewed before answering my bestie’s ring. Cookie worked cheap, which made her the best receptionist in all of Albuquerque, in my humble opinion. But she was also very good at her job. I’d set her on the task of finding everything she could about the Fosters. She was as fascinated as I was.  
  
  After another quick sip to wash down the crumbs, I finally answered. “Do you think if I lived on Cheez-Its and coffee alone, I’d ultimately starve to death?”  
  
  “They had another son,” she said, her voice full of awe.  
  
  I had no idea what that had to do with my question. “Does he eat Cheez-Its?”  
  
  “The Fosters.”  
  
  I bolted upright. “Can you repeat that?”  
  
  “The Fosters had another son.”  
  
  “No way.”  
  
  “Way.” I heard her fingernails clicking on the keyboard as she worked her magic. “Very much way.”  
  
  “After Reyes?”  
  
  “Yes. Three years after the abduction.”  
  
  “Do you know what this means?” I asked, my awe matching her own.  
  
  “I certainly do.”  
  
  “Reyes Farrow—”  
  
  “—has a brother.”  
  
  \#Holyshit.

  Note to self: Thanks for always being there.  
  
  —T-SHIRT  
  
  I sat stewing in a foggy kind of astonishment. Cook did, too. We sat in absolute silence, broken only by the sound of Cheez-Its crunching between my teeth, for several tense seconds.  
  
  “Are you still on your stakeout?” Cookie asked at last.  
  
  I swallowed. “Yes. I think Mrs. Foster came home, but her garage door closed before I could catch a glimpse. I have, however, bonded with the naked dead man in my passenger seat.”  
  
  “Well, there’s that.”  
  
  “Right? He has a tat. I’m sending you a picture.”  
  
  “Of his tat?” she asked, surprised.  
  
  “Of my drawing of his tat. Hold on.” I sent the pic with the caption Don’t judge underneath it. “Okay, how are things back at the fort?”  
  
  “A Mr. Joyce came in and insisted on seeing you today. He seemed really agitated. He wouldn’t leave his number or anything. I told him you’d be back this afternoon. Is this a new kind of Rorschach test?” She was referring to my drawing.  
  
  “Turn it sideways.”  
  
  “Oh, okay. Andrulis.”  
  
  “Do you know him?” I asked, my voice edged with hope.  
  
  “Nope. Sorry. I knew an Andrus once. He was hairy.”  
  
  I checked out Mr. A. “This guy isn’t that hairy. He is well endowed, though.”  
  
  “Charley,” she said, appalled. “Get your mind out of the gutter.”  
  
  “Dude, it’s right there. It’s not like I can miss it.”  
  
  “Oh, poor man. How would you like to be walking around naked for all eternity?”  
  
  “You just described my worst nightmare.”  
  
  “I thought your worst nightmare was that one where you are eating a hot pickle and it burned your lips and they swelled until you looked like you’d had injections.”  
  
  “Oh, yeah, there’s that one, too. Thanks for bringing all that back up again. I should sleep beautifully tonight.”  
  
  “Did you call your uncle?”  
  
  My uncle Bob, a detective for the Albuquerque Police Department, had the hots for Cookie, and Cookie had the hots for him—but neither one would make the first move. I got so tired of watching them pine for each other that I decided to do something about it. I set Cookie up on a date with a friend of mine to make Uncle Bob, or Ubie as I liked to call him in my therapy sessions while trying to explain why I had a debilitating fear of mustaches, jealous. Maybe a little competition would light a fire under his ass. The same ass Cookie had a major thing for.  
  
  “Sure did. How’s our plan coming along?”  
  
  “You mean your plan?”  
  
  “Fine, how’s my plan coming along?”  
  
  “I don’t know about this, Charley. I mean, if Robert wanted to go out with me, he’d ask, right? I’m not sure trying to make him jealous is a good idea.”  
  
  It always took me a minute to figure out who Robert was. “Are you kidding? It’s a fantastic idea. It’s Uncle Bob we’re talking about here. He needs motivation.” I gave one last glance to the Fosters’ house before driving off.  
  
  “What if he loses interest?”  
  
  “Cook, have you ever lost interest in a pair of shoes because someone else was looking at them?”  
  
  “I guess not.”  
  
  “Didn’t it make you want them even more?”  
  
  “I wouldn’t go that far.”  
  
  I turned onto Juan Tabo and started back toward the office. “Okay, I’m headed that way. How about lunch?”  
  
  “Sounds good. I’ll meet you downstairs.”  
  
  My office was on the second floor of the best brewery the Duke City had to offer. It’d recently undergone a change of ownership when Reyes bought it from my dad. The idea of Reyes as a business owner warmed the cockles of my heart. Whatever those were.  
  
  “He has a brother,” I said, still stunned at the possibilities of it all.  
  
  “He has a brother,” she agreed.  
  
  This I had to see.

Don’t know what to do.","Hi everyone. I (23F) have been in a relationship with my fiancé (24M) for 8 years. We were high school sweethearts and got engaged about 4 months ago. He proposed with both our families present. 

Our relationship hasn’t been easy. In the beginning, he cheated on me more than six times in the first two years, and we were on and off. Around the 2.5-year mark, he went to both our families, apologized, and promised to change. Since then, he’s been faithful and generally a good partner. He is a great partner, but stubborn in his own ways.

That said, we fight a lot, probably every second week. About 85% of our fights are about my low sex drive. He can also be a bit controlling: I’m not allowed to go out at night because it’s “dangerous,” I can’t have close male friends, and he often complains that I don’t give him enough attention. I’ve kind of just accepted that as part of our relationship. Don’t get me wrong, he makes me happy, he makes me smile, he makes me feel content.

But here’s where things get complicated.

Three years ago, I started working at a company where I met a colleague (27M), let’s call him Terry. We became close friends about six months in, and eventually best friends. Over time, I started falling for him, and those feelings have only grown stronger.

Terry is very private, but he opened up to me in a way he doesn’t with anyone else. He’s never been in a relationship before because he’s focused on his career. He still lives with his parents to save money for a future house. His mom is a higher-up in the company, and she and I get along pretty well.

A couple of days ago, Terry’s mom actually sat me down for coffee. She told me she suspects Terry is in love with me. She said she’s seen him cry over me and noticed the way he looks at me. She said that if I felt the same way, their family would welcome me with open arms because they already see me as part of their life. She acknowledged how difficult my situation is but said I’d eventually have to make a choice.

Then yesterday, Terry confessed everything. He told me he’s in love with me, that I’m his soulmate, that he’d do anything for me. He promised honesty, communication, joint decision-making, and treating me the way I deserve. He said I’m the only person he’s ever connected with emotionally, that he sees me as the woman he wants to marry, the mother of his future children, and the person he wants to share everything with, including his first sexual experience.

He said he regrets not confessing sooner, that fear held him back, and that keeping it inside has been eating him alive.

We kissed (more than once) both that day and the next. And now the guilt is eating me alive.

Here’s my problem:
1) I love Terry, but I also love my fiancé.
2) With my fiancé, I’m not sure if it’s genuine love or more of a “comfort love” because we basically grew up together.
3) With Terry, I imagine a future, one I’ve secretly thought about for the past two years.

But if I pursue Terry, everything in my current life blows up: I’d have nowhere to live, my job would be filled with gossip, and my fiancé has given me so much. Every time I look at him, I feel like the worst person alive.

For context: right before my fiancé proposed, we had a week-long argument about sex. I was very close to breaking up with him then and confessing to Terry, but I didn’t, because I thought Terry only saw me as a best friend.

Now I don’t know what to do. I feel torn in half. I’ve tried praying and reading the Bible, but I haven’t gotten a clear sign. I don’t really have any friends I can talk to about this.

What should I do? What would be best, for me, for my fiancé, and for Terry?",0,1755458229.0,relationships_advice,4,0.4,False

   * Note #19, is a blue memo which states: THE NEXT FOUR BOXES MARKED BY ""MOON SYMBOL"" CONTAIN FALSE STATEMENTS. And box #23 is the first Moon Symbol box that appears after this.
   * Between all of these notes, there are 2 verifications that Note #23 is false.

* **Room 8** \- The statue of the Bear has the text:
   * IF WE SPEND A MIN OR TEN
   * LOUNGING IN THE DEN
   * YOU’LL KNOW WHICH BIN
   * I’M OFTEN IN
   * The solution for which Sin Bin to place this bear in, would be >!SLOTH!<
* **Chamber of Mirrors** \- The Den is 1 of the 16 Floorplans that you can find in the cabinets of the upper level of the Chamber of Mirrors. By selecting it, you may choose to add a permanent copy of this room to your daily Draft Pool.
* **Laboratory** \- There is an experiment Condition which drafting the Den will always trigger:
   * ""For each room with a fireplace you draft,""
   * This experiment is added after you get the Satellite Dish and download a data packet.
* **Wine Cellar + Trophy Room** \- All 3 of these rooms use a similar aesthetic of natural wooden beams and furniture, very similar stonework walls, low lighting, and provide gems: 1, 3, and 8.

# Misc Room Details

**Visual**

* The Den is a Swan Room (one of the many rooms containing a swan), an Arrow Room (one of many rooms that has a line with arrows, located on 2 of its clocks), and a Clock Room (one of many rooms with a working clock)
* For lighting, there is 1 Fireplace lit, 3 candles unlit (1 of which is knocked over), and 3 lamps (only the small one is lit).
   * (note: you cannot light the candles in this room)
* There are 2 completely empty display cabinets in the corners, which is unusual in this game.
* There are 6 assorted clocks, all working except for 1 pendulum is stuck.

* The fireplace light (at one point in its back and forth cycle) highlights the numbers 7 through 11 on the small clock with the broken pendulum. I hope this is just a visual coincidence.

* The coffee table has ""two 3-sided legs"" and ""two 4-sided legs"".
* The bottom layer of glass on the coffee table is not the same shape as the top layer. The bottom layer is more like an Arch, and the top is more like an Hourglass. The bottom layer seems to be different based on the different leg shapes on each side of the table.

* The Chronograph has similar moving gears, 1 gear going clockwise, and 2 going counter-clockwise, however the clock hands are always going backwards on it.

**Pendulums**

* The Grandfather Clock has a pendulum which swings with a left/right cycle of 4.2 secs. This equals exactly 5 minutes (in-game time) for 9 cycles (Mt. Holly's dimensions are 5 x 9) ...funny
* The small Clock on the bookstand has a broken pendulum which doesn't move.
* The fireplace shadow moves across the floor like a very slow pendulum with a back and forth cycle of 40 secs. This equals exactly 8 minutes (in-game time) for 1.5 cycles

# More Misc Info - The Den Secret?

Just as the description of this room claims, the Den is notorious for wasting people's entire day.

**Interesting features of the Den (that might drive you crazy looking for secrets) :**

* The lockbox on the mantle with 2 swans facing it. (cannot be unlocked)
* The clock on top of this lockbox matches the clock in the Drawing Room.
* The pair of Clocks with arrows drawn on them in a V shape, pointing to approximately 11 and 1.
* There is also an arrow going left to right above this V, showing a clockwise passing of either 10 minutes or 2 hours.
* These 2 clocks are sitting on the wall in the same layout as the 2 stopped clocks in Room 46 (which are stuck at 1:30)
* There are 2 matching V-arrow clocks in the Sauna and Weight Room, both rooms related to lounging or the passing of time as the Den has been described. Sauna - people lounge and pass time in the Sauna, and the Weight (wait) Room.
* The grandfather clock in the Den matches a stopped clock in the basement, which is stuck around 8:22 or 8:23.
* The same grandfather clock is also in Room 46 and working.
* There is a painting pair with a grandfather clock that seems to be set at around 10:10
* The Room Directory image of the Den shows the Giant clock at about 2:53
* The ENORMOUS clock that takes up a whole wall with 3 large gears.
* The small clock that is running, but has a broken pendulum.
* The moving fireplace shadow that moves across the floor like a very slow pendulum back and forth.
* The Bear statue in Room 8 that says ""If we spend a min or ten lounging in the den"".
* The Den's Blue Tent >!Note, which mentions the ""use of time"".!<
* The fallen candlestick.
* The Treasure Trove note that claims ""...there is more to the Den than meets the eye"" (which is a false green note).

**People have tried a myriad of methods to uncover secrets in this room, including:**

* Drafting the Room at 11:05 and waiting until 12:55.
* Drafting the Room at 12:55 and waiting 10 minutes in game.
* Waiting in the room for over 24 hours in game time (3 hours IRL).
* Bringing the Bear Statue from Room 8 in here. (these statues seem to return to Room 8 when you leave Room 8)
* I tried Bringing every key possible to the lockbox (Key 8, Diary Key, Prism Key, Secret Garden Key, Wind-up Key, Basement Key, Silver Key, Car Keys, Keycard, Master Key, 4 Vault Keys, 3 Cabinet Keys, Sanctum Key, and >!Key of Aries!<)
* I also tried Bringing EVERY item, including a running stopwatch, Gear Wrench, Hall Pass, all 8 contraptions, and 4 Armory items to the room and clicking on the lockbox, clocks, and other objects.
* Adjusting the Chronograph backwards while drafting the Den (and while drafting other rooms From the Den) to see if reversing the time on the Chronograph by different amounts could affect the time inside the Den.
* I tried drafting the Den on every square of the estate and looking for differences.
* I also noticed there is a painting pair with a grandfather clock that seems to be set at around 10:10, and being in the Den at this time, with that painting in the room, and clicking everywhere on the grandfather clock or the lockbox between 10:05 to 10:15 does nothing.
* Digging for Treasure in here provides nothing unique.
* Drafting the Den after a Foyer, and the fingers point right at the swans

I have learned how to respect others boundaries and how to put myself in other peoples shoes to see their perspective and value their feelings. I feel like I got to a point in my life where I was able to surrender my control over things and just let things go. The last 3 weeks I haven’t been bothered by anything that normally would upset me. I was able to feel it, ride the wave, and let it just blow on by. 

Then today I just feel so off. I feel very irritated by every little tiny little thing and internally I feel very highly reactive. I don’t like this after feeling well for so long. I don’t want to do anything. And I definitely don’t want to be around anyone for fear that I will yell at my kids or overreact out of irritation. They don’t deserve that.  I did tell them that I need a little space and some quiet for a bit and I was honest. I told them that I was feeling grumpy and cranky but it wasn’t their fault. I was trying to think of what was different today and I guess it could be a combination of PMS and drinking a cup of coffee this morning. I didn’t do anything physical and just crocheted laying on the couch, so maybe the caffeine was just too much for being inactive. As much as I don’t want to, I’m going to try opposite action to get out of my head and go for a walk outside.

I am still learning about them. Last year, a neurologist diagnosed me with anxiety, depression, ADHD (inattentive-type), and autistic spectrum disorder.

Is it worth seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist for the following symptoms/experiences?:

Ruminating obsessively about previous conflicts
Fidgeting/doodling (writing my name in cursive over and over during class lectures); biting the inside of my cheeks throughout the day.
Needing my hair styled perfectly - if not I become increasingly anxious and have a meltdown; same with needing my glasses to be spotless at all times
When people come over, I go in my room and lock the door and try to stay quiet
Constantly reorganizing (i.e., deleting all my calendar events and re-creating the events; creating spreadsheet budgets and spending hours on trying to perfect them, deleting the entire spreadsheet, and restarting several times). When I was in school, I would keep track of the amount of credits, my GPA -- anything that had numbers or certain requirements.
Repeating stories multiple times because I forgot if I've told them already
Singing the same parts of songs repeatedly throughout the day.
Scripting conversations with customers and others. Being called very methodical at work.
When I was younger, I would dream about my neighbor's house being on fire and that it would spread to mine. Similarly, I was obsessed with the sensation of my eyes closing which would keep me up all night.
Obsessive thoughts about possibly being gay. I remember being kept up all night worrying about whether or not I was gay, if my voice sounded gay, if my behavior was gay. I do have homosexual attractions. In tandem with this I had worries if I was going against my religion as a Catholic for having these thoughts and obsessed over how to get rid of them. I still do.
Extreme anxiety before going somewhere; fear of being late even if very early.
Panic when using public restrooms; inability to urinate even when necessary, with hot sweats.
Hypervigilance: listening in on conversations, scanning the environment.
Constant teeth clenching and body tension. Very hard for me to smile.
Avoiding walking near others; discomfort being close on sidewalks. Getting gas, for example, is highly uncomfortable and overstimulating because of all the people around.
Extreme indecision and overwhelm when making decisions.
Passive suicidal ideation
Cynical, negative thinking; tendency to make everything negative. Aloofness throughout life.
Teeth clenched all day, constant anxiety.
Loss of interest in people, friends, and activities.
Consistent disappointment in others; struggle trusting people.
Emotional withdrawal; preferring solitude with dog, coffee, or in backyard/room.
Monotone expression at work. Have been told I look deadpan.
I am literally unable to ever relax. I do not enjoy my time with friends because I am always in my head. I can never comprehend any movie we watch together. Often, I am asked by my friends if I am ""alright"" because I am suddenly quiet and get in my head.
All of these symptoms interfere with my ability to do well in jiu-jitsu class. Whatever was just taught to me goes out the window until reinforced by the coach many times over.
While I am very empathetic and would sit there and listen to others all day, I have developed apathy for some of those people. I notice I attract seemingly narcissistic and psychotic individuals. My personality type is INFJ if that helps clarify anything.

1mszo21,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mszo21/i_wish_i_could_take_it_back_but_he_wont_let_me/,"I wish I could take it back, but he won't let me...","I wake up just like every other day. My alarm blaring, head pounding, sweating as I bolt upright in my bed. I struggle to remember the nightmare that had woken me up but it always escapes me. I can see her standing before me, but cant remember how or why she was there. As I start to become more alert the look of betrayal on her face fades back into obscurity, leaving me alone again.  Blackout curtains still drawn so I can't see the complete filth I live in. Ever since Mary left me I've barely taken care of myself. It's as if she took all of my motivation to live from me as she walked out the door.

I walk to the bathroom and as I turn the light on a shooting pain rips through my skull. Jesus Christ what did I do last night? I can't remember a thing but this headache suggests I drank a whole distillery worth of moonshine. I don't even look as I shovel a handful of ibuprofen into my mouth and dry swallow. It hurts and I choke on the pills but I can't even be bothered to wait for myself to pour a glass of water, the pulsating in my temple is unbearable.

I look up in the mirror to see the aftermath of another nightmare forgotten. Sweat streaming down the wrinkles in my skin like rivers down a mountain. My eyes so bloodshot you'd think I popped every blood vessel in them. My greasy hair matted over my face, which as ashamed I am to say I haven't showered in days, at least it helps hide the face of a man who has given up on life. I run the sink so I can at least wash my face, I've given up but even now I refuse to sit in a pool of sweat.

I know she would've hated to see me like this, Mary used to be so kind and caring towards me. We met a a couple years ago in college. I always noticed when she was around like a sixth sense. Something would tell me to turn my head and I'd immediately be blessed to see that absolute angel of a woman. She always had the most radiant smile on her face and seemed to grant everyone around her a sense of euphoria. I had always been a loner in life and wished that I could feel that. That sense of belonging, of pure unbridled joy, would be enough to pull me out of my constant cycles of depression, but I knew I'd never be able to approach her. I'm too much of a coward and I thought I wouldn't want to dim her light. I thought of her like a beautiful work of art, I could observe her beauty from behind the velvet ropes but could never interact with her.

It wasn't until I was ready to give up on my life that I would be given the grace of having her introduced into my life. My grades has slipped, my mother died, and I still had not a single friend in the world to speak to. I had decided to go off the hiking trail on campus to end it, I figured at least I'd be able to appreciate the tranquility of nature in my last moments. As I walked the trail someone behind me called out, and I turned to see her. That same smile that could disarm even the harshest of personalities on her face as she told me how glad she was to see someone else who could appreciate nature trails instead of sitting on a computer all day. I don't remember much of that first conversation because I was too enamored by her and bewildered by the fact that she would actually speak to me.

We had walked the whole trail together just talking about our lives, our interests, and our dreams. I had told her I didn't have any friends, much to my own horror. I was so embarrassed that I had said it, I expected her to see me as some loser unworthy of her time. She didn't react to my accidental confession like that though. Instead she told me she'd be honored to be my friend which led to us making a weekly arrangement to walk the trails and recap our weeks. Our weekly walks evolved into meeting for lunches, then dinners, late night hangouts, until finally she asked me to be her boyfriend. I was in shock. This woman had not only unknowingly saved my life, but now she wanted to be a part of it. But like anything else in my life, it wouldn't be for long.

A few months ago she told me that she felt I was ""dimming her light"". We argued over days, her saying how she needs someone more extroverted, and me saying that I don't have the energy to go out and meet new people. She always wanted me to be more involved in her friend group but I felt it was s o draining pretending to like being around them. None of them knew what it was like to not be a part of the ""in crowd"" and aside from Mary, none of them made any effort to include anyone that wasn't a part of their immediate clique. The arguments devolved into full on fights until about a week later she ended it. She told me she needed someone who had the same love for life as her, and just as quickly as she entered my life, she had left it.

As I get dressed I have the same thought I always do, that wasn't really her talking. The Mary I knew was loving and caring. She supported me through everything, helped me build a life after dropping out of college. She never would've just given up. Something had happened to her, someone got in her ear and took advantage of her good nature. They convinced her I wasn't good for her just because I'm different from them. They want her light to themselves, but I won't let that happen. I wont let them take her light, I need her in my life. I'll get her back one day.

I scroll through my phone as I walk out the door into the daylight, hoping for a text or missed call but I know nothing there. I go to my favorite coffee shop and that's where I first see him. A man stands in the back of the room, staring at me. He's wearing a pristine three piece suit, freshly shined shoes, and a gaudy watch that I can only imagine costs more than my own net worth. Although his outfit suggests wealth and success, his physical appearance is a gross juxtaposition of what his attire implies. His face gaunt, deep indentations in his cheeks amplify the skeletal look of his jaw. The top of his head has a few wisps of ghostly white hair with vast gaps between them, but the real problem is his eyes. Deep sunken pits in his head so dark you cant even see his eyes, but I know he's staring right at me. I can feel him drilling into me, never blinking, never turning away, his focus is entirely on me. Something about him is familiar to me but I can't place it, which creates a feeling of dread deep in the pit of my stomach.

The barista calls my name and I take my coffee, but when I turn back the man is gone. I don't bother wasting another second thinking about him as I make my way back out to the street. This weekly routine is all I have left of her to remember. We'd get our morning coffee then walk through the park, usually discussing something existential like ""What do you think exists at the edge of the universe?"" or ""Were the Doozers in Fraggle Rock just supposed to represent communism?"" (which I still wonder from time to time).

I retrace our usual route through the cities historic district to the park, admiring the old architecture and small mom and pop shops as we used to together. As the park comes into view I'm overwhelmed by memories of us first moving to the city and discovering there was a park within walking distance. We would reminisce about how we first met, and revel in the fact we could continue our weekly tradition that we started years ago. As the park drew closer I was reminded of what she had done, no, what someone else made her do. How she was torn away from me. How she was convinced that she needed to abandon me. How she needed to leave me to preserve ""her light"" which she had so graciously granted me. As my thoughts race I get that feeling I had in college. She's here. I turn to look and I don't see Mary, but *HIM*.

The second I realize it's the man from the coffee shop that feeling of dread reappears. Immediately I slip into a state of panic and I can feel my head pound again. Is he following me? Does he know me? Why is he so familiar? Maybe he's the one who got in Mary's ear. Maybe *he's* the reason she left me. I consider going up to him and asking these questions, but I'm too afraid to approach him. Something about him doesn't seem right. I feel like by going up to him I'm walking to my own demise. Instead I turn and sprint across the street away from him towards the park, stumbling over the curb and have to catch myself to keep from falling. When I turn back to see if he gave chase, once again I see that the man has disappeared.

I look around frantically to try to find him to no avail. While I should feel at ease not seeing him, something tells me I'm worse off not knowing where this man is. Am I crazy for thinking someone was stalking me? After all, there's nothing interesting about me. The only thing I really had going for me was Mary, so without her what do I have that would motivate someone to follow me. The thought gives me slight relief, because although I'm again alone in the world there's nothing of note to differentiate me from anyone else. There's nothing special about me, it was all her.

I collect myself and enter the park, perhaps thinking of our time together walking through the park will distract me. I walk down the central path as we used to, remembering seeing her dance and laugh as if no one was watching. She never cared what others thought of her. She never felt shame or embarrassment, a stark contrast to myself. I never had it in me to join her, but I appreciated watching her. Eventually I made my way to a bench in the middle of the park. It has a clear view of a field where kids and families would play together. It was here that she would talk about how she'd love to come here with our kids one day. Despite being together for some time at this point I was still amazed at the prospect. She wanted a family with me and I could see it so clearly. She'd be an amazing mother, and I could only imagine how happy kids would be having such a loving mother.

As I watch joggers run by me the feeling of happiness escapes me again. If I wasn't here it wouldn't affect any of their lives. No one would miss the man on the park bench. They pass me by in life just as everyone else does. That future that was so real for me is gone now, and with it went any happiness I might've experienced. I go to stand so I can walk back to my hovel and wallow in self pity, but as I get up a hand is placed on my shoulder and sits me back down. I know it's him. He's behind me, and doesn't want me to leave.

""*You can't leave yet, that isn't how this goes*.""

The stink of his breath rolls over me like a sheet. His breath hot on my neck and reeking of rotten meat.

""Who the fuck are you?! Why are you following me?"" I managed to get out while trying to stifle my urge to vomit.

""*Don't you feel it? She's here...*""

As he says this I look up to see her there, standing beneath a tree with some guy. He's tall, athletic, perfectly handsome, everything I'm not. This isn't what upsets me though. What upsets me is that smile. She's grinning ear to ear, that same smile that I fell in love with. How could she be so happy without me? Is ***HE*** the reason she left me? Is ***HE*** supposed to be the person to protect her light? Of course, it makes sense now. He stole her away from me, he wriggled in her head like the snake he is and convinced her to leave me.

""*Your light is right there, but you're too much of a coward to take it back, aren't you*?"" the voice behind me said.

""No! I need her, I want it!""

""*Then show me*."" he whispered as he slid his hand into my pocket and released my shoulder.

I turn to look at him but just as every other time, he was gone. I look back again towards Mary and that snake to see her walking away, leaving him behind. I have to confront her. I finally know why she did this to me. I follow her out of the park feeling another pair of eyes watching me. I try to place the man's face again, try to find where I know him from, but the thoughts are overridden by trying to think of what ill say to her. I was so hurt by her, so betrayed. She needs to hear it. She needs to know that she's not as kind as she pretends to be. I can help her. She's just being manipulated. She doesn't know what she's doing.

I follow her out of the park, this isn't a conversation to have in public. She turns down a side street and-OH SHIT. Where did she go? How the hell did I lose her? I was only about ten yards behind her. Across the street stands the man again. He's standing in front of a living room window, for once not looking at me. I approach him, hoping he could help me. I stand next to him, gagging on the smell wafting off of him again.

""*She's in there, now go get what you came here for.*""

He doesn't turn to look at me, doesn't move an inch. He just stares in the window. When I look with him I see her. She's laying on the couch, talking on the phone, laughing. The man motions toward the door and I step towards it. As I turn the doorknob I see she left the door unlocked. I try to be as quiet as I can while I enter the house. I don't want her to get freaked out and tell whoever she's talking to to call the cops. She could think I'm just some burglar. She doesn't know its just me. She doesn't know I'm trying to fix this. She doesn't know I'm trying to help her.

I wait in the hall until she hangs up. This is it, this is my chance to make everything right.

""Mary I need to talk to you.""

She jumps off the couch screaming. She tries to grab her phone off the couch but I get to it first.

""Listen I know you think you had to leave me but that's only because you let other people take advantage of you. They told you I wasn't good for you, they told you that you had to protect yourself from me""

She's running around the living room screaming for help, Jesus why wont she just shut up and listen to me? Doesn't she know I love her? She tries to push past me to get to the door and we both fall over, something falls out of my pocket onto the floor with a loud thud. We both look to see a revolver lying on the floor. I pick it up and stand over her.

""Please Mary, I just need you to listen.""

""How the fuck did you get in here?! Please don't hurt me! I promise I wont tell anyone!""

""You're not listening, he poisoned you! He told you to leave me! I cant live without you! I need you!""

She scrambles to her feet and tries to run from me. I grab her by the hair and try to get her to listen again. She just needs to listen.

""What the fuck are you talking about?! No one convinced me to do anything! I just wasn't happy but I'm sorry! We can work this out I promise just please don't hurt me!"" she screams, tears streaming down her face.

What the fuck does she mean? She left me on her own? No, she wouldn't do that. They've convinced her to do this and their hooks are so deep in her she cant even realize it. She'll never snap out of it. I have to help her. A shock vibrates through my body. My ears are ringing. I let go of Mary as she falls limp on the floor. I look up and see the man again through the window, he's just watching me. That terrifying smile finally across his face. I hate seeing it every day. I hate knowing he'll never leave me. In that moment grief overwhelms me. Why did I do this to her? Why couldn't I just let her go? Why did I take that joy out of the world? Maybe I don't deserve it. That happiness was never meant to be mine. He's still just staring at me, smiling at me. He makes me relive this moment every day. I'll never escape this. I'm so sorry Mary, I didn't want to hurt you, it just happened. I kiss her on the forehead before raising the gun to my temple. I look at the man in the window as I pull the trigger.

....

I wake up just like every other day. My alarm blaring, head pounding, sweating as I bolt upright in my bed. I struggle to remember the nightmare that had woken me up but it always escapes me. I can see her standing before me, but cant remember how or why she was there. As I start to become more alert the look of betrayal on her face fades back into obscurity, leaving me alone again.  Blackout curtains still drawn so I can't see the complete filth I live in. Ever since Mary left me I've barely taken care of myself. It's as if she took all of my motivation to live from me as she walked out the door.",1,1755457812.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I absolutely adore your channel. I bought some of your Stay Petty Coffee mugs for my daughter and I because she adores you also lol. I can't wait to see the wedding photos!!

Anywhoo, on to my story....

Would I be the AH if I, a fabulous 40ish F, have been told by my M (52) BF, that I am an arrogant B\*\*\*h when I told him he needs to step up and find a job and help with bills that I paid for, for us, for 4 months!

Context... sorry if this is long winded but I need to get this off my chest!

I lived most my life with a lot of emotional, verbal and physical abuse by several people around me, mainly, from relationships. I grew up in a major city, moved and raised my children in a more rural area of the US, and I feel I did a good job holding life together, despite many setbacks, being humbled by life and money, while raising kids alone. I thank the higher powers, that my children aren't the little a\*\*holes I see on TV or social media. I'm very proud of them both. They are living life and doing the best they can, I can't complain.

 When the time finally arrived for me to find myself again, after my youngest graduated high school.  I found myself in a good place in life, and I moved to a new, more exciting place that I've always dreamed of visiting, let alone move to. If it wasn't for a strong family bond, I probably would have ended up somewhere else, still cold and bored, but I'm thankful for my choice in that aspect. 

I have had some ""relationships"" since I've been here, none have turned out long term, which is fine, because I do have standards and morals I try to live by, and I refuse to settle for less then I feel I deserve, considering the traumas I've endured. But that's another story... anyways...

I met a great guy about a year ago. He had recently moved to the area, and we met thru a dating app. We dated for a while, had some fun adventures together, and was in the process of learning each other, no major red flags, but there were times I felt claustrophobic or smothered. Maybe it was just me being guarded due to my past, but we had a great time together always laughing and enjoying life.

We both talked about how we had suffered past traumas, and I was ok with that, because I felt secure within myself to help cope. He had never been thru anything like what he experienced, prior to meeting me, where I, sadly had, multiple times in life.

Despite him losing his job unexpectedly shortly after we met, he agreed to move in with me, and he said he wanted to find another, better job. I was happy for him and tried to be as supportive as I could. I never pressured him and made sure that was what he wanted to do, and I also let him know that he would have to help with bills, because that's an extra person in the home I shouldn't have to pay for. He agreed!

 I make decent money at my job, for the most part, and am still trying to find my own way up, to move forward with my life because that's the whole reason why I moved to where I did, more opportunity. I didn't mind helping at first while he found his ""niche"". But after a few months, it started to get, old and financially overwhelming.

He had turned down a couple jobs nearby that paid well enough, but he was more worried about a specific type of job title then a ""job"" that helps pay bills. I can't blame him for that entirely, but it didn't help with the bills and the extra money I was spending to accommodate him while he was looking for work instead of working. I wanted to save money to move for when my lease was up, while he was here, that he also agreed I needed to move, we were going to find another place together but now the extra financial stress from him not helping, has fallen on me and it put me in a rough spot with money. 

I love this man, I do feel is he a genuinely good guy. I never wanted to sound rude or B\*\*\*y when I brought up that I needed help with finances, and I can admit that I was an A\*\*hole about it at times with my complaining, but I am not afraid to speak my mind. He promised he would help financially, he even contacted family to help send money to help us/ me out, I haven't seen a dime. He has since moved out and won't speak to me. Not sure where to go from here. I thought about small claims court but I'm not sure I can afford the time off from work or the headache of dealing with it. Help!

So, my lovely petty potatoes, AITA for standing my ground and refusing to be a door mat?

Just letting you know… meeting fellow redditors from here hasnt been disastrous at all.

so, context... earlier today a girl posted here asking about the green school swimming pool situation.
I’d been meaning to check it out too. I’m just a beginner swimmer, so I thought it would be perfect to tag along with someone who’s also not a pro and matches my level. My girl friends aren’t into swimming at all, so I never ended up going.
And I didnt want to ask my guy friends. It just a comfort thing, nothing major. 

Then today’s post happened, and I thought to myself,
“Ohhh finallllyyy found someone to go with!”

I texted her with the vibe:
**Yoo yay girlie let’s go swim, my swimsuit is old but ig I'll manage, haha, fun swim girls’ day out sort of thing** these weren't the exact words but I was in this mood while texting.

Fast forward to the meeting spot.
The text from opposite side said: “I'm wearing a pink tee.”
I spot the pink tee… 
and ....
 it’s a guy.

Wait wuuttt... 
In my mind i started
Recalculating…
Revisiting my chats..
~ Oh, I never actually asked if this person was a he or she.
~ Oh, I had the swimsuit convo thinking it was a girl.
~ Oh no, I can’t even swim properly, what about my first impression in front of a guy??
~ Should I abort mission??

But then I told myself: “Bruh, this is just a gender twist. You've handled bigger crisis”
So I walked up and said HII! 

And honestly… it went fine:
~ few mins into the meeting, we were talking like buddies
~ Pool is good, clean, big. Divided male & female sections.
~ crowd was less.
~ He swims like a pro (compared to me).
~ I was swimming after a year, so I looked like a mess splashing around… but he said he’s not judgmental, so ig that works.
~ we had coffee and masala coke and fries after the swim
~swimming is the best exercise, my personal opinion 

Why it happened how it happened? Because I was desperate to check that pool out that I missed to do the full proof checking on the person.(but it turned out be a fun swim session, no regrets here) 

So now..
Any girls here living nearby to this pool area who are also interested in swimming?

 Fights feel super fake. Why does it always have to be one guy vs 20 people? Even 1 vs 5 would feel more intense, realistic, and “massy.”


If a trained fighter punches someone in the face, physics says they should fall, not get launched 10 feet in the air.


 The kill count is just insane. This isn’t GTA Vice City. In real life, if I yell a O word at my bitchy neighbor, cops will show up in an instant. How’s the hero casually killing 30 guys ( tho they're rowdies and bad guys) without police, media, or even relatives demanding justice in some sort of ' salai mariyal' ? 


For example, the coffee shop fight in Leo impressed me because it felt more grounded.

IMO, a good fight sequence needs 3 things:

1) A reason for the hero’s fighting skills (veteran, cop, assassin, martial artist, etc.)

2) Respect for physics (no human catapult punches)

3) Respect for human limits (a skilled fighter can maybe take on 3–6 guys at a time, maybe 10 with guns, not an entire village , unless you’re Kratos).


---

TL;DR: Fight scenes are better when they’re grounded in physics, human limits, and character skills. Not when heroes fight 20+ guys, ragdoll people into the sky, or rack up GTA-style kill counts with zero consequences.",1,1755457209.0,JKreacts,1,1.0,False

 STERLING, LOUISIANA  
  
  “How are you feeling?” Mom asked with an appraising eye. “You sure you’re up for this?”  
  
  I finished my hair, pasted on a smile, and lied through my teeth, “Definitely. ” Though we’d been over this, I patiently said, “The docs told me that settling back into a normal routine might be good for someone like me. ” Well, at least three out of my five shrinks had.  
  
  The other two insisted that I was still unstable. A loaded gun. Trouble with the possibility of rubble.  
  
  “I just need to get back to school, around all my friends. ”  
  
  Whenever I quoted shrinks to her, Mom relaxed somewhat, as if it was proof that I’d actually listened to them.

I could remember a lot of what the docs said—because they’d made me forget so much of my life before the clinic.  
  
  With her hands clasped behind her back, Mom began strolling around my room, her gaze flickering over my belongings—a pretty, blond Sherlock Holmes sniffing for any secrets she didn’t yet know.  
  
  She’d find nothing; I’d already hidden my contraband in my book bag.  
  
  “Did you have a nightmare last night?”  
  
  Had she heard me shoot upright with a cry? “Nope. ”  
  
  “When you were catching up with your friends, did you confide to anyone where you really were?”  
  
  Mom and I had told everyone that I’d gone to a special school for “deportment. ” After all, you can’t prep a daughter too early for those competitive sororities in the South.  
  
  In reality, I’d been locked up at the Children’s Learning Center, a behavioral clinic for kids. Also known as Child’s Last Chance.  
  
  “I haven’t told anyone about CLC,” I said, horrified by the idea of my friends, or my boyfriend, finding out.  
  
  Especially not him. Brandon Radcliffe. With his hazel eyes, movie-star grin, and curling light-brown hair.  
  
  “Good. It’s our business only. ” She paused before my room’s big wall mural, tilting her head uneasily. Instead of a nice watercolor or a retro-funk design, I’d painted an eerie landscape of tangled vines, looming oaks, and darkening skies descending over hills of cane. I knew she’d considered painting over the mural but feared I’d reach my limit and mutiny.  
  
  “Have you taken your medicine this morning?”  
  
  “Like I always do, Mom. ” Though I couldn’t say my bitter little pills had done much for my nightmares, they did stave off the delusions that had plagued me last spring.  
  
  Those terrifying hallucinations had been so lifelike, leaving me temporarily blinded to the world around me. I’d barely completed my sophomore year, brazening out the visions, training myself to act like nothing was wrong.  
  
  In one of those delusions, I’d seen flames blazing across a night sky. Beneath the waves of fire, fleeing rats and serpents had roiled over Haven’s front lawn, until the ground looked like it was rippling.  
  
  In another, the sun had shone—at night—searing people’s eyes till they ran with pus, mutating their bodies and rotting their brains. They became zombielike blood drinkers, with skin that looked like crinkled paper bags and oozed a rancid slime. I called them bogeymen. . . .  
  
  My short-term goal was simple: Don’t get exiled back to CLC. My long-term goal was a bit more challenging: Survive the rest of high school so I could escape to college.  
  
  “And you and Brandon are still an item?” Mom almost sounded disbelieving, as if she didn’t understand why he would still be going out with me after my three-month absence.  
  
  “He’ll be here soon,” I said in an insistent tone. Now she’d gotten me nervous.  
  
  No, no. All summer, he’d faithfully texted me, though I’d only been allowed to respond twice a month. And ever since my return last week, he’d been wonderful—my cheerful, smiling boyfriend bringing me flowers and taking me to movies.  
  
  “I like Brandon. He’s such a good boy. ” At last, Mom concluded this morning’s interrogation. “I’m glad you’re back, honey. It’s been so quiet around Haven without you. ”  
  
  Quiet? I yearned to say, “Really, Karen? You know what’s worse than quiet? Fluorescent bulbs crackling twenty-four hours a day in the center. Or maybe the sound of my cutter roommate weeping as she attacked her thigh with a spork? How about disconnected laughter with no punch line?”  
  
  But then, that last one had been me.  
  
  In the end, I said nothing about the center. Just two years and out.  
  
  “Mom, I’ve got a big day. ” I shouldered my backpack. “And I want to be outside when Brand shows. ” I’d already made him wait for me all summer.  
  
  “Oh, of course. ” She shadowed me down the grand staircase, our steps echoing in unison. At the door, she tucked my hair behind my ears and gave me a kiss on my forehead, as if I were a little girl. “Your shampoo smells nice—might have to borrow some. ”  
  
  “Sure. ” I forced another smile, then walked outside. The foggy air was so still—as if the earth had exhaled but forgotten to inhale once more.  
  
  I descended the front steps, then turned to gaze at the imposing home I’d missed so much.  
  
  Haven House was a grand twenty-two-room mansion, fronted by twelve stately columns. Its colors—wood siding of the lightest cream, hurricane shutters of the darkest forest green—had remained unchanged since it’d originally been built for my great-great-great-great-grandmother.  
  
  Twelve massive oak trees encircled the structure, their sprawling limbs grown together in places, like hundred-ton hydras trapping prey.  
  
  The locals thought Haven House looked haunted. Seeing the place bathed in fog, I had to admit that was fair.  
  
  As I waited, I meandered across the front lawn to a nearby cane row, leaning in to smell a purple stalk. Crisp but sweet. One of the feathery green leaves was curled so that it looked like it was embracing my hand. That made me smile.  
  
  “You’ll get rain soon,” I murmured, hoping Sterling’s drought would finally end.  
  
  My smile deepened when I saw a sleek Porsche convertible speeding down our oystershell drive, a blur of red.  
  
  Brandon. He was the most enviable catch in our parish. Senior. Quarterback. Rich. The trifecta of boyfriends.  
  
  When he pulled up, I opened the passenger door with a grin. “Hey, big guy. ”  
  
  But he frowned. “You look . . . tired. ”  
  
  “I didn’t get to bed till late,” I replied, darting a glance over my shoulder as I tossed my bag into the minuscule backseat. When the kitchen curtain fluttered to the side, I just stopped myself from rolling my eyes. Two years and out . . .  
  
  “You feeling okay?” His gaze was filled with concern. “We can pick up some coffee on the way. ”  
  
  I shut the door behind me. “Sure. Whatever. ” He hadn’t complimented me on my hair or outfit—my Chloé baby-blue sleeveless dress with the hem no more than four regulation inches above the knee, the silky black ribbon that held my hair back in a curling ponytail, my matching black Miu Miu ankle-wrap heels.  
  
  My diamond earrings and Patek Philippe wristwatch served as my only jewelry.  
  
  I’d spent weeks planning this outfit, two days in Atlanta acquiring it, and the last hour convincing myself I’d never looked better.  
  
  He hiked his wide shoulders, the matter forgotten, then peeled down Haven’s drive, tires spitting up an arc of shell fragments as we zoomed past acre after acre of cane.  
  
  Once we’d reached the highway, a seamed and worn-out stretch of old Louisiana road, he said, “You’re so quiet this morning. ”  
  
  “I had weird dreams last night. ” Nightmares. Nothing new there.  
  
  Without fail, my good dreams were filled with plants. I’d see ivy and roses growing before my eyes or crops sprouting all around me.  
  
  But lately in my nightmares, a crazed redheaded woman with gleaming green eyes used those same plants to . . . hurt people, in grisly ways. When her victims begged for mercy, she would cackle with delight.  
  
  She was cloaked and partially hooded, so I couldn’t make out all of her face, but she had pale skin and green ivylike tattoos running down both her cheeks. Her wild red hair was strewn with leaves.  
  
  I called her the red witch. “Sorry,” I said with a shiver. “They kind of put me in a funk. ”  
  
  “Oh. ” His demeanor told me he felt way out of his depth. I’d once asked him if he had nightmares, and he’d looked at me blankly, unable to remember one.  
  
  That was the thing about Brandon—he was the most happy-go-lucky boy I’d ever met. Though he was built like a bear—or a pro football player—his temperament was more adoring canine than grizzly.  
  
  Secretly, I put a lot of store in him, hoping his normal could drag me back from my wasteland-visions brink. Whi  
ch was why I’d fretted about him finding another girl and breaking up with me while I was locked up at CLC.  
  
  Now it seemed like at least one thing was going to work out. Brandon had stayed true to me. With every mile we drove away from Haven, the sun shone brighter and brighter, the fog lifting.  
  
  “Well, I know how to put my girl in a good mood. ” He gave me his mischievous grin.  
  
  I was helpless not to be charmed. “Oh, yeah, big guy? How’s that?”  
  
  He pulled off the road under the shade of a pecan tree, tires popping the fallen pecans. After waiting for the dust to pass us, he pressed a button and put down the convertible top. “How fast you wanna go, Eves?”  
  
  Few things exhilarated me more than flying down the highway with the top down. For about a nanosecond I considered how to repair the utter loss of my hairstyling—braid a loose fishtail over your shoulder—then told him, “Kick her in the guts. ”  
  
  He peeled out, the engine purring with power. Hands raised, I threw my head back and yelled, “Faster!”  
  
  At each gear, he redlined before shifting, until the car stretched her legs. As houses whizzed past, I laughed with delight.  
  
  The months before were a dim memory compared to this—the sun, the wind, Brandon sliding me excited grins. He was right; this was just what I needed.  
  
  Leave it to my teddy bear of a football player to make me feel carefree and sane again.  
  
  And didn’t that deserve a kiss?  
  
  Unbuckling my seat belt, I clambered up on my knees, tugging my dress up a couple of inches so I could lean over to him. I pressed my lips against the smooth-shaven skin of his cheek. “Just what the doctor ordered, Brand. ”  
  
  “You know it!”  
  
  I kissed his broad jaw, then—as my experienced best friend Melissa had instructed—I nuzzled his ear, letting him feel my breath.  
  
  “Ah, Evie,” he rasped. “You drive me crazy, you know that?”  
  
  I was getting an idea. I knew I played with fire, teasing him like this. He’d already been reminding me of a promise I’d made right before I left for deportment school: If we were still going out when I turned sixteen (I was a young junior), I would play my V card. My birthday was next Monday—  
  
  “What the hell does that guy want?” he suddenly exclaimed.  
  
  I drew my head back from Brandon, saw he was glancing past me. I darted a look back, and my stomach plummeted.  
  
  A guy on a motorcycle had pulled up right next to us, keeping pace with the car, checking me out. His helmet had a tinted visor so I couldn’t see his face, but I knew he was staring at my ass.  
  
  First instinct? Drop my butt in the seat, willing my body to disappear into the upholstery. Second instinct? Stay where I was and glare at the pervert. This was my morning, my laughter, my fast drive in my boyfriend’s luxury sports car.  
  
  After a summer spent in a fluorescent hell, I deserved this morning.  
  
  When I twisted around to glare over my shoulder, I saw the guy’s helmet had dipped, attention definitely on my ass. Then he slowly raised his head, as if he was raking his gaze over every inch of me.  
  
  It felt like hours passed before he reached my eyes. I tugged my hair off my face, and we stared at each other for so long that I wondered when he was going to run off the road.  
  
  Then he gave me a curt nod and sped past us, expertly dodging a pothole. Two more motorcycles followed, each carrying two people. They honked and cheered, while Brandon’s face turned as red as his car.  
  
  I consoled myself with the knowledge that I’d probably never have to see them again.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  To preserve his paint job, Brand parked in the back of the Sterling High parking lot. Even among the many Mercedeses and Beamers, his car attracted attention.  
  
  I climbed out and collected my book bag, groaning under the weight, hoping Brand would take a hint. He didn’t. So, on an already stifling morning, I would be schlepping my own stuff.  
  
  I told myself I liked that he didn’t help me with my books. Brand was a modern man, treating me as an equal. I told myself that a lot on our long trek toward the front entrance.  
  
  Probably just as well. I had my secret sketchbook in my bag, and I’d learned the hard way never to let it out of my possession.  
  
  When we reached the freshly irrigated quad, someone produced a football, and Brand’s eyes locked on it like a retriever’s. Somehow he broke his trained gaze to look at me with a questioning expression.  
  
  I sighed, smoothing my hair—frantically braided once we’d reached Sterling city limits. “Go. I’ll see you inside. ”  
  
  “You’re the best, Eves. ” He grinned—with dimples—his hazel eyes bright. “I figure even you can make it from here by yourself!”  
  
  I was, in fact, directionally challenged. For someone who didn’t have a mean bone in his body, he tended to land some zingers.  
  
  I reminded myself that Brandon had a good heart, he just genuinely didn’t know better. I’d begun to realize that he was a good boy, but not yet a great guy.  
  
  Maybe I could drag him over the finish line with that.  
  
  He planted a sweet kiss on my lips, then jogged off with one hand raised for the ball.  
  
  Heading toward the front doors, I passed a rosebush with double blooms of poppy red—my favorite color. A breeze blew, making it seem like the flowers swayed to face me.  
  
  Ever since I could remember, I’d loved all plant life. I drew roses, oaks, vine crops, and berry briars compulsively, fascinated with their shapes, their blooms, their defenses.  
  
  My eyelids would go to half-mast from the scent of freshly tilled pastureland.  
  
  Which was part of my problem. I wasn’t normal.  
  
  Teenage girls should be obsessed with clothes and boys, not the smell of dirt or the admirable deviousness of briars.  
  
  Come, touch . . . but you’ll pay a price.  
  
  A metallic-blue Beamer screeched into a parking space just feet from me, the driver laying on the horn.  
  
  Melissa Warren, my best friend and sister from another mister.  
  
  Mel was a hyperactive wild child who was a stranger to shame and had never acquainted herself with embarrassment. And she always leapt before she looked. I was actually surprised she’d managed to survive her summer overseas without me.

We’d been best friends for a decade—but without a doubt, I was the brains of that operation.  
  
  I couldn’t have missed her more.  
  
  Considering her five-foot-eleven height, Mel hopped out of her car with surprising speed, raising her straightened arms over her head and snapping her fingers. “That’s how you park a car, bitches. ” Mel was going through a phase lately where she called everyone bitches.  
  
  Her mother was the guidance counselor at our school, because Mel’s dad had paid for Sterling High’s new library—and because Mrs. Warren needed a hobby. Most parents figured that if Melissa Warren was a product of her parenting skills, then they shouldn’t put much stock in Mrs. Warren’s guidancing skills.  
  
  Today Mel wore a crisp navy skirt and a red baby-doll T-shirt that had probably cost half a grand and would never be worn again. Her bright Dior lipstick was a classic red to match, her auburn hair tied with a navy bow. Prepster chic.  
  
  In short order, she popped her trunk, dragged out her designer book bag, then locked her keys in the car.  
  
  With a shrug, she joined me. “Hey, look over my shoulder. Is that Spencer in the quad with Brand?” Spencer Stephens III, Brand’s best friend.  
  
  When I nodded, she said, “He’s looking at me right now, isn’t he? All pining-like?”  
  
  He was in no way looking at Mel.  
  
  “This year I’m taking our flirtationship to a new level,” Mel informed me. “He just needs a nudge in the right direction. ”  
  
  Unfortunately, Mel didn’t know how to nudge. She play-punched hard, titty-twisted with impunity, and wasn’t above the occasional headlock. And that was if she liked you.  
  
  In a pissy tone, she added, “Maybe if your boyfriend would—finally—set us up. ”  
  
  Brandon had laughed the last time I’d asked him, saying, “As soon as you housebreak her. ” Note to self: Put in another request today.  
  
  Two of our other friends spotted us then. Grace Anne had on a yellow sateen dress that complemented her flawless café-au-lait skin. Catherine Ashley’s jewelry sparkled from a mile away.  
  
  The four of us were popular bowhead cheerleaders. And I was proud of it.  
  
  They smiled and waved excitedly as if I hadn’t seen them every day last week as we’d spilled deets about our vacations. Mel had modeled in Paris, Grace had gone to Hawaii, and Catherine had toured New Zealand.  
  
  After I’d repeatedly declared my summer the most boring ever, they’d stopped asking about it. I was pictureless, had zero images on my phone for three months, not a single uploadable.  
  
  It was as if I hadn’t even existed.  
  
  But I’d dutifully oohed and aahed over their pics—blurred, cropped shots of the Eiffel Tower and all.  
  
  Brand’s pics—of him smiling at the beach, or at his parents’ ritzy get-togethers, or on a yacht cruising the Gulf Coast—had been like a knife to the heart because I should have been in all of them.  
  
  Last spring, I had been. He had an entire folder on his phone stuffed with pics and vids of us goofing off together.  
  
  “Great dress, Evie,” Catherine Ashley said.  
  
  Grace Anne’s gaze was assessing. “Great everything. Boho braid, no-frills dress, and flirty, flirty heels. Nicely done. ”  
  
  With a sigh, I teased, “If only my friends knew how to dress, too. ”  
  
  As we walked toward the front doors, students stopped and turned, girls checking out what we were wearing, guys checking for a summer’s worth of developing curves.  
  
  Funny thing about our school—there were no distinct cliques like you saw on TV shows, just gradations of popularity.  
  
  I waved at different folks again and again, much to the bowheads’ amusement. I was pretty much friends with everybody.  
  
  No one ever sat alone during my lunch period. No girl walked the hall with a wardrobe malfunction under my watch. I had even shut down the sale of freshman elevator passes on our one-story campus.  
  
  When we reached the entrance of the white-stuccoed building, I realized school was just what I needed. Routine, friends, normalcy. Here, I could forget all the crazy, all the nightmares. This was my world, my little queendom—  
  
  The sudden rumble of motorcycles made everyone go silent, like a needle scratch across an old record.  
  
  No way they’d be the same creepers from before. That group had looked too old for high school. And wouldn’t we have passed them?  
  
  But then, it wasn’t like the genteel town of Sterling had many motorcyclists. I gazed behind me, saw the same five kids from earlier.  
  
  Now I was ready to meld into auto upholstery.  
  
  Each of them was dressed in dark clothes; among our student body’s ever-present khaki and bright couture, they stood out like bruises.  
  
  The biggest boy—the one who’d leered at me—ramped over the curb to the quad, pulling right up on the side to park. The others followed. I noticed their bikes all had mismatched parts. Likely stolen.  
  
  “Who are they?” I asked. “Have they come to start trouble?”  
  
  Grace answered, “Haven’t you heard? They’re a bunch of juvies from Basin High School. ”  
  
  Basin High? That was in a totally different parish, on the other side of the levee. Basin equaled Cajun. “But why are they here?”  
  
  “They’re attending Sterling!” Catherine said. “Because of that new bridge they built across the levee, the kids at the outer edge of the basin are now closer to us than to their old school. ”  
  
  Before the bridge, those Cajuns would have had to drive all the way around the swamp to get here—fifty miles at least.  
  
  Until the last decade or so, the bayou folk there had been isolated. They still spoke Cajun French and ate frogs’ legs.  
  
  Though I’d never been to Basin Town, all of Haven’s farm help came from there and my crazy ole grandmother still had friends there. I knew a lot about the area, a place rumored to be filled with hot-blooded women, hard-fighting men, and unbelievable poverty.  
  
  Mel said, “My mom had to go to an emergency faculty meeting last night about how best to acclimate them or something like that. ”  
  
  I could almost feel sorry for this group of kids. To go from their Cajun, poor—and adamantly Catholic—parish to our rich town of Louisiana Protestants . . . ?  
  
  Culture clash, round one.  
  
  This was actually happening. Not only would I have to see the guy who’d shamelessly ogled me, I’d be in the same school with him.  
  
  I narrowed my eyes, impatient for him to take off his helmet. He had the advantage on me, and I didn’t like it.  
  
  He stood, unfolding his tall frame. He had to be more than six feet in height, even taller than Brand. He had on scuffed boots, worn jeans, and a black T-shirt that stretched tight over his chest.  
  
  Beside him was a couple on a bike—a kid in camo pants and a girl in a pleather miniskirt. The big boy helped her off the bike, easily swinging her up—  
  
  “Wheh-hell,” Catherine said, “good to know her panties are hot pink. Shocked she’s wearing them, actually. Classy with a capital K. ”  
  
  Mel nodded thoughtfully. “I finally understand who buys vajazzling kits. ”  
  
  Grace Anne, proud wearer of a purity ring, screwed her face up into an expression of distaste. “Surely she’s going to get sent home with a skirt that short. ”  
  
  Not to mention her midriff-baring shirt, which read: I GOT BOURBON-FACED ON SHIT STREET!  
  
  Once he’d set the girl on her feet, she took off her helmet, revealing long chestnut-brown hair and a face made up to an embarrassing degree with glaring fuchsia lipstick.  
  
  The skinny boy who’d been driving her removed his own helmet. He had dark-blond hair and a long face, which wasn’t unhandsome but still reminded me of a fox.  
  
  He revved his motorcycle, startling two passersby, and his friends laughed.  
  
  Or rather a weasel. Strike feeling sorry for them.  
  
  Finally, the big one reached for his helmet. I waited. He yanked it off, shook out his hair, and raised his head. M  
y lips parted.  
  
  Mel voiced my thoughts: “I kind of wasn’t expecting that. ”  
  
  A tangle of jet-black hair fell over his forehead, with jutting tousles above his ears. His face was deeply tanned, with a lantern jaw and strong chin.  
  
  He looked to be older than eighteen. Overall his features were pleasing, handsome even. Though he couldn’t hold a candle to Brandon’s Abercrombie looks, the boy was attractive in his own rough way.  
  
  “He’s gorgeous,” Catherine said, her eyes lighting up with interest. We called her Cat-o-gram because she could never hide her reactions, displaying them for all to see.  
  
  People passed us in the doorway, speculating about the newcomers:  
  
  “My maid comes from Basin. She said all five of them are juvies with records. ”  
  
  “I heard the tall boy knifed two guys in the French Quarter. He was just released from a year’s stint in a cage-the-rage correctional center!”  
  
  “The blond boy is a sophomore for the third try. . . . ”  
  
  Weasel and the big one started for the entrance, leaving the other two and the girl to smoke, right out in the open.  
  
  The big one dug a flask from his back pocket. On school grounds? I noticed his fingers were circled with white medical tape for some reason.  
  
  While Weasel sneered at everyone he passed, his friend just narrowed his eyes with an unnerving resentment, as if he was disgusted by the kids at this school.  
  
  As the boys neared, I could make out some of their words. They spoke Cajun French.  
  
  My grandmother had taught it to me—before she’d been sent away—and for years I’d listened to the farm help speak it. As they’d stomped through Haven’s fields in their work boots, I’d followed in my miniature boots, eagerly listening to their wild tales of life deep in the bayou.  
  
  I understood the dialect well. Not that this was something to brag about, since I could barely understand proper French.  
  
  I saw Weasel glowering at a nearby group of four JV cheerleaders. As he stalked closer, the girls grew visibly nervous; he yelled, “BOO!” and they cried out in fright.  
  
  Weasel snickered at the girls’ reaction, but the other boy just scowled in their direction, muttering, “Couillonnes. ” He pronounced it coo-yôns. Idiots.  
  
  Any tiny lingering inclination to be friendly to the new students—as was my usual way—died. They were messing with my khaki tribe.  
  
  Then Weasel zeroed in on me with a smirk. “Ain’t you dat jolie girl in dat Porsha?” His Cajun accent was as thick as any I’d ever heard. “Turn around, you, and hike up dat dress, so I can tell for true. ”  
  
  My friends’ shocked expressions had me squaring my shoulders, refusing to be cowed by either of these boys. They’d come into our domain, acting like they owned the place.  
  
  With a sunny smile, I said, “Welcome to our school. ” My tone was part bubbly, part cutting—a mash-up of sugar and snide so perfected I should TM it. “I’m Evie. If you need assistance finding your way around our campus, just let someone—else—know. ”  
  
  If possible, Weasel’s leer deepened. “Well, ain’t you sweet, Evie. I’m Lionel. ” He pronounced it Lie-nell. “And this here’s my podna Jackson Deveaux, also known as Jack Daniels. ”  
  
  Because of the flask? How delightful.  
  
  Jackson’s eyes were a vivid gray against his tanned skin, and they were roaming over my face and figure like he hadn’t seen a girl in years—or hadn’t seen me minutes ago.  
  
  Lionel continued, “We doan need no ass-is-tance finding our way, no, but there’re other tings you can ass-ist us with—”  
  
  Jackson jammed his shoulder into Lionel’s back, forcing him along. As they walked down the hall, the big Cajun snapped under his breath, “Coo-yôn, tu vas pas draguer les putes inutiles?”  
  
  My eyes widened as understanding hit me.  
  
  Catherine said, “Did you see the way that boy was looking at Evie?”  
  
  “I didn’t understand a word of that gibberish they were talking,” Mel said. “And I just got back from Paris. ” She turned to me. “So what’d the big one say?”  
  
  Grace asked, “You speak Cajun?”  
  
  “A little. ” A lot. Though I didn’t particularly want everyone in Sterling to know I spoke the “Basin tongue,” I translated: “Idiot, you’re not going to chat up one of those useless bitches?”  
  
  Catherine gasped. “You lie. ”  
  
  As I watched Jackson striding down the hall, I noticed with amazement that the flask was not the only thing he kept in a back pocket of his jeans.  
  
  I could clearly make out a knife, a folded blade outlined in faded denim.  
  
  Then I frowned. Was he heading into my homeroom?  
  
  Grace said, “Wait a second. What did that boy mean about you hiking up your dress in a Porsche?”  
  
  Chapter 3  
  
  DAY 5 B. F.  
  
  For lunch period, Mel and I were lying out on a blanket in a sunny spot in Eden Courtyard, sleeves and skirts rolled up.  
  
  All around us, roses and gardenias bloomed. A marble fountain gurgled. Brand and Spencer were playing a pickup game in the adjoining quad with other boys, laughing in the sun.  
  
  And Jackson Deveaux?  
  
  He was loitering just outside our courtyard with the other Cajuns, sipping from his flask while the rest smoked. And he was staring at me.  
  
  Ignore him. I was determined to enjoy the rest of lunch relaxing with my best friend; never would I take for granted this precious freedom.  
  
  I exhaled. Okay, so maybe I wasn’t precisely relaxing. I’d been on edge since I’d woken this morning from another nightmare of the red witch.  
  
  In each one, I seemed to be present with her, watching from a short distance away, forced to witness her evil deeds. Last night, she’d been in a beautiful golden field, surrounded by a group of cloaked people, all on their knees. She was tall, towering over their bowed heads.  
  
  With a laugh, she’d cast bloody grain in front of them, demanding that the people lap it up, or else she’d slice their flesh to ribbons and choke them in vine.  
  
  As she’d bared her claws, sinister purple ones that looked like rose thorns, her victims had wept for mercy. She’d given them none.

I’ve been in ARFID recovery since an inpatient stay two years ago and I’m generally doing well but still have my ups and downs. I’ve always hated cooking and felt like I was a bad cook. When I was in active ED, I would have meltdowns if I cooked something that didn’t turn out well. 

Lately, I’ve been so broke that I’ve been relying on food banks for 95% of my groceries. Most food banks just give out ingredients instead of pre-made meals. I’m very fortunate to have one near me that gives out locally grown fresh fruit and vegetables. I’ve always been a ramen/cereal/pbj/frozen burritos/vegan nuggets girl, so using dry ingredients and raw veggies has been a challenge. 

Long story short, now I’ve been cooking much more, eating more fresh foods, using up the stuff that’s been hiding in the back of my pantry, and experimenting with ways to preserve food. Living alone with finicky preferences, I’ve wasted so much food in the past. Somehow it never really occurred to me before that you can freeze most things before they go bad and save them for later. So my freezer is now happily full. 

So far, I’ve made:

Two different kinds of veggie spaghetti sauce

Burrito bowl with black beans, green rice, and sweet potatoes 

Banana bread 

Kale chips with nutritional yeast  

Limeade bc I was craving Gatorade

Planning on making soon:

Roasted potatoes with Marsala seasoning

Sweet potato fries

Zucchini bread 

Apple sauce

I’ve been back on keto for 28 days now after a long break. The main reason I decided to restart was to tackle my chocolate addiction, and so far it’s been going well.

I’ve only had chocolate once, and even then it was keto-friendly. I made a chocolate mousse with liquid sucralose (0 g sugar), eggs, and butter, and it turned out perfect. It didn’t knock me out of ketosis.

However, I’m an avid coffee drinker, and the coffee I used to indulge in is from the Middle East. It’s prepared the same way as Turkish coffee, but it’s not Turkish coffee. According to the nutritional information, the whole 400 g package contains 86.5 g of carbs, of which 16.5 g are sugars. A 400 g pack usually lasts me about a month if I drink it three times a week.

My question is: although the sugar content per serving is quite low, could the high fiber content be a risk for getting kicked out of ketosis? I admit I’m quite ignorant when it comes to fiber. Mind you that most of the beans used in making this coffee isn’t being digested.

Add to that my clumsiness and we have the following four ""trials"" (all results are from testing the watches on a timegrapher, distances are in metric).

* Tissot PRS 516 from around 2010
   * ETA 2836-2 movement.
   * Dropped on the floor when taking it off my wrist (so about 1m high).
   * Went from about +4 spd before the drop to -20 spd, sadly I didn't take a note of the beat error before the drop to compare.
* Rolex Sub 124060
   * Rolex 3230 movement.
   * Dropped on the floor by my 1-year old from a coffee table, about 50cm high.
   * Went from +1.5 spd to +11 spd, beat error went crazy, from 0.2ms to 1.1ms.
* GO PanoMaticLunar
   * GO caliber 90-02 movement.
   * Dropped on the floor twice
      * from a shelf about 1.5m high.
      * from a night stand about 50cm high.
   * No impact on time keeping or any other parameter.

In summary:

* I was kind of expecting the Tissot's accuracy to suffer since it was a pretty high drop.
* Really disappointed with the Rolex, especially since it wasn't that high of a drop.
* The GO really surprised me. Even holding it, you get the impression that it's built like a tank and not a fragile dress watch. I guess this further confirms it.

Please bear with me, it’s hard to explain these symptoms. I used to drink coffee religiously, but stopped due to my natural high levels of anxiety. Since stopping, the anxiety has gotten much much better. 

Yesterday morning, I decided to have a cup of coffee. Big mistake. While driving, it became very hard for me to focus on the road, I wouldn’t say I’m seeing double, but in a way I am??(I know, confusing) it almost felt as if my right eye was misaligned. Things sort of looked distorted, I could not read much on my phone screen, I would get lost between lines when reading text, etc. it almost felt as if I had a hand over my right eye, like things weren’t lining up. It felt like when you close one eye and put your finger out in front of you, and it is in one place, and then when you switch eyes, the finger switches over a little. 

After about 45 minutes, the symptoms went away, but then it followed with a pretty bad headache for a couple of hours. This has happened to me before, and I have never been able to explain it. After giving it, some thought, I do believe when this has happened to me previously, it was after drinking coffee. I have good eyesight, don’t wear glasses or contacts.

I had my life together and was on top of things for the first time. It was a feeling I’ll never forget. My family and friends saw the changes too.

Sadly I miss it. But towards the end I remember feeling like my anxiety got out of control. I’ve always had terrible anxiety but at first Adderall made me calm and relaxed, so I was surprised that a year later it felt like my heart was racing, my hands were shaking, and I would feel paranoid everyone was thinking i’m cracked out. The feeling became too much and I couldn’t do it anymore, so I stopped.

I failed out of college and knew I would’ve only been able to do it on medication but ever since then my heart feels tense and I get jittery from any stimulant even coffee, which didn’t used to happen to me.

BUT THEN at the carnival he is solely there to take her to the train station.. (wouldn’t do that if he knew about thornhills plan). So IMO at this moment in time he isn’t aware of Wednesday and what she means to this plan and is just the girl he likes..

Both went really well and I was expecting the worst. When we first saw this house for sale, my partner and I laughed and were like ""yeah we're never going to get it but wth let's just put in an offer"". It was crazy because when this house became active, we were focusing all of our energy on two other houses. We fully believed competition would snuff out any chance of us getting it, similar houses we lost on twice went for 30k over and had like over ten offers each, cash, waived inspections, etc. Then we watched the house continue to be active for another week, past the first open house, when we assumed it would be gone by the next day. Prime location, beautiful historic midcentury Cape Cod house- there was no way it would sit. A couple days after that, it was still active. I was like ""is something wrong with it? Maybe we should just go for it."" My partner went to see it with our realtor and only had good things to say about it. They meticulously took videos and we even brought our moisture meter to check for water damage. Everything was good. Then, the sellers had a second open house. My partner went to that and saw many rich older folks sussing the place out, taking pictures. A guy (my partner guessed he was some kind of investor) came up to the selling agent literally rubbing his hands together and was like ""so when are all offers due?"" And the realtor was almost coy about it and said ""Mmm, there is no offer deadline"". My partner thought that was weird, but in a good way. A hopeful way. A day later we submitted our offer, including a letter detailing how meaningful this house would be for us, still thinking they were just waiting for a really high offer. We expected a rejection. And then the next day, our realtor texts us and is like ""you got it"". There were others offers, but we got it. I know there are a lot of people here who tell you that letters are BS, but I believe these sellers were looking for people who actually cared about the house and the neighborhood. This particular area is wonderful but three quarters of the area is full of rentals, so it's naturally stalked by money-hungry investors and landlords. We wanted a forever home and a place where my partner's mom could live out her retirement in peace. We are ten days away from making that a reality.

I've cried almost every day since we found out. I look at the house on Zillow and see ""pending"" and have a moment of ""oh. For once, I'm not finding out we lost on a house because the status changed. It's ours."" Me, my partner and my partner's mom all come from really unstable and unsafe housing histories, and I have never lived anywhere that felt truly rooted. I cry when I look at the beautiful light in the dining room because I know that's where we'll eat breakfast and drink coffee. I cry when I see the skylights in the ceiling because I know I'll see our giant tree out back waving at me. I cry because I can lie down in a bed next to the one I love, plant flowers, paint walls, watch movies on a rainy night,  put up a Christmas tree, and live a life that doesn't feel like I'm flying by the seat of my pants, a life where I have to pack everything up a year later, or I don't have enough room, or my disgusting bathroom got Landlord Special-ed 20 times over.

Excited to post here on our final closing day. I spend a lot of time watching TikToks of other families finding out their offers were accepted and it brings me a lot of joy. I want everyone to experience this feeling. I am so privileged and so blessed by this life. And I will probably cry again today when I remember this is no longer a seemingly unattainable fantasy.

Hey, Im Sean (29M) For starters, my sister is on my dads side, name- Cee(30F)

Her brother, Ro (28M) is on her MOMs side. In NO relation to me. Let's get the facts straight.

 My sister has always had the lime light on all sides of the family. She’s child free, runs her own company, has a bachelors… I- on the other hand am a Gay icon who does drag. (Our parents are African native… you do the math) So the love was always put on her. Our family hosts annual cookouts where we all come together for good times. Last year, Cee brought Ro to the cookout. Now he has always been fine growing up but I didn't hang around him much so I didn't know how he swang. This year was…real different. Cee brought him so that he would feel comfortable being himself since he's come out as gay, she wanted us to get to know each other more so we could all hang out. She walked away and Ro and I started talking. We have a lot in common, the shows we watch, even our values are similar. We talked the rest of the night, girl i dont even think i ate! I get his number and he saved mine in his phone with a wink emoji…so I'm thinking he's flirting with me. I told Cee i would drop him off if she wanted to leave early since hes on the way to my house. She said “mmm” and made a face like we should be careful. Around 12 I drove him home, we were vibing, listening to music and having a ki. We pull up to his apartment and he put his hand on my thigh as were sitting there talking. Now yall, I already know a baby gay is gonna put their hook into any meat they can find, but i was ready to be reeled in,  this man is SO FINE. Hes looking deep in my eyes and asked me to come upstairs. Of course I said yes! He poured me a glass of wine and sat on the couch next to me. He asked if i wanted to play a card game with “extra rules.” Intrigued, i asked what the conditions were. He wanted to play strip uno. I laughed cause its a bit dated but i gave in. We’re playing, im “losing”, and in the last round, he kissed me. (its damn near 3am now) No lie babes, this was the best kiss I've ever had. He brushed up against me and next thing i know were flying free on the couch. Around 9am i noticed i spent the night and were in his bed. Not the worst place ive woken up in. He is bringing me coffee, and it was JUST the way i like it…And he listens bitch, i was in heaven. I leave and next thing i know, im getting a call from Cee asking how everything was. I start gabbing off and i told her we kissed. She told me to run that back… and then quickly hangs up the phone.. Im confused cause were all grown, so a kiss shouldnt have been bad… 10 minutes later, Ro texting me talking about “what did you do?”, and im just hella confused. I try calling both Ro and Cee and NO ONE fucking answers… im thinking something happened like something serious… Cee finally calls me in the evening and is cussing me out cause now she knows we fucked. I am like “why is he telling our business” cause hes an adult. Now if you know anything about african families you know about Whatsapp. Next thing i know the family groupchat is getting blown up and im getting aired out by Cee, and i still dont fucking know why any of this is a problem. My mom starts calling me and asking if im having sex with my siblings and starts praying over the phone. I hang up cause i do not want to interact with any of this. Im pissed off at this point so i set up a group with Ro Cee and i sent them a long message basically saying that im grown and so is Ro so whatever tf we do is our business. I then put my phone on DND and didn't hear from anyone for a while. A couple of days later i get a call from Cee, apologizing for how she reacted and asked to meet at her house to talk about it. I love how shes able to correct her mistakes…SO I THOUGHT! This bitch done set me up with an intervention, i get to her house and my mom, dad, aunt, grandma, sister,  and Ro and there! They sit me down talking about how “God is disappointed that im gay and its worse to be incestrous” What the actual fuck were they talking about?! I couldn't even stay in Cee’s house for 5 minutes. I looked to Ro, said “If you wanna be talked down to like this and believe them, you do that by yourself babes. I am NOT the one.” and walked out that mf. Its been a week and the phone calls and messages have been nonstop. I dont feel guilty for fucking him. We're grown. The End!

1msywr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1msywr8/does_tide_hygienic_clean_liquid_detergent_deliver/,Does Tide Hygienic Clean Liquid Detergent Deliver on Its 10x Cleaning Promise? Review,"Testing out the Tide 30772122433 Hygienic Clean Heavy 10x Duty Liquid Laundry Detergent has been quite the experience over the past month. As someone who battles everything from coffee spills to grass stains—thanks to an overly enthusiastic dog and a clumsy coffee-drinking habit—finding a detergent that actually delivers on its promises feels like a tiny miracle. With claims like removing invisible dirt and providing a hygienic clean, this product piqued my interest right away. Naturally, I had to put it to the test, and here’s how it fared.

**Design and Packaging**  
The first thing I noticed about this detergent is its robust packaging. The 84 fl oz bottle is sturdy yet compact enough to store easily. The cap doubles as a measuring tool, which is surprisingly handy when you’re trying not to overuse the product (or underuse it, for that matter). It’s thoughtful additions like these that save you from the eternal detergent guessing game. Also, the bright Spring Meadow scent delivers a light floral freshness that isn’t overwhelming—it’s subtle enough to be inoffensive even to those sensitive to powerful smells.

**Key Benefits**
- Effectively removes invisible and visible dirt.
- The Spring Meadow scent leaves clothes smelling incredibly fresh.
- Works equally well in both hot and cold water conditions.
- Highly concentrated, so you use less detergent per load.
- Compatible with high-efficiency (HE) machines.

[Check Tide 30772122433 price on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/link/b0cq3rrgr4/)

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
My primary concern with detergents is whether they can tackle the variety of stains life hurls at me. This product got high marks across the board, handling red wine, grease, and even chocolate stains like a pro. What sets it apart, though, is its claim to clean ""hidden dirt."" While I can't see microscopic dirt (because, well, who actually can?), my clothes not only looked freshly laundered but also felt cleaner, almost softer. The 10 concentrated cleaning actives obviously have some serious stain-fighting chops. I even tested it on older, stained workout clothes, and they came out looking nearly brand new. That was impressive.

**Ease of Use**  
One of the underrated aspects of the product is how easy it is to measure the right amount of detergent. Unlike other messy pour-and-pray situations, the cap design here is idiot-proof. Another cool feature is its versatility, as it works in both HE and conventional machines. Since I alternate between my front-loader at home and an older washer at my mom’s house, this was a huge plus. I didn’t have to worry about buying separate products for different machines.

**Scent Strength**  
This detergent’s Spring Meadow scent strikes a nice balance between fresh and floral. I’ve had other detergents overpower my clothes to the point where I could taste the lavender (not ideal), but this stayed relaxing and mild. The fragrance lingered just enough without being aggressive, giving clothes that “fresh out of the dryer” feel. Even my husband, who isn’t usually a fan of scented laundry products, didn’t complain this time—which practically counts as a five-star rating.

**Drawbacks**
- Lacks a pump dispenser, which could make pouring easier.
- Could be considered pricey compared to bargain-brand detergents.
- The fragrance may not appeal to everyone, especially those preferring scent-free options. 

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other heavy-duty detergents like Persil ProClean and Arm & Hammer Plus OxiClean, this one feels a bit more premium. Persil has comparable stain-fighting power but lacks the smooth, subtle scent that Tide delivers so effortlessly. On the other hand, Arm & Hammer is significantly more budget-friendly, but it often requires a higher quantity per load to get similar results. If scent and efficiency matter to you as much as performance, this one nudges out competitors for its perfect all-around formula.

**Price Performance**  
While the detergent isn't the cheapest on the shelf, its highly concentrated formula means you use less per wash. That translates to fewer purchases over time. Given that it works in various water conditions and machines while tackling difficult stains, it definitely feels like a good financial investment. Undeniably, you'll save time and money by not rewashing stubborn loads—fewer repeat washes = lower utility bills!

Like many of you, I was frustrated with having to check multiple apps and websites to see if any of my cards or memberships had a discount at a specific restaurant/hotel/spa and which one of them gives the best discount.

So, I built a simple tool for myself to solve this. It's a single search bar where you can type in a location's name and see the offers.

It's very basic right now and is **completely free with no ads or signup.** It only includes these four programs to start:

* Fazaa
* Groupon
* ADCB
* Liv Bank

How it works:

* Filter by your memberships so you only see deals you're actually eligible for.
* Search for a specific place (e.g., ""Cheesecake Factory"") to check for a deal on the spot.
* Leave the search empty to browse all available offers in a category, sorted by the biggest discount first.

I decided to clean it up and share it in case it's useful to anyone else. I would love your honest feedback.

  “Please, just let me die,” Zoe whispered harshly, hugging her bent knees tightly against her chest as the hot water continued to rain down on her, giving her some relief from the nausea, not much, but at the moment she’d take whatever she could get.  
  
  “Sweetheart, you need to take this pill,” Trevor patiently explained from where he knelt on the bathroom floor beside the bathtub, holding a pill and the cup of ginger ale that was even at this distance causing her stomach to lurch violently.  
  
  She clamped her mouth shut, because just the thought of putting anything in her mouth right now made her pray for death. She couldn’t do this. She just couldn’t, she decided, unaware that she’d started shaking her head with a miserable moan. All she wanted to do was sit here under the spray of hot water for the next five months until it was time for the babies to come out, but she knew that was impossible thanks to the small hot water heater that would probably only last for a few more minutes.  
  
  “Please take the pill,” Trevor said soothingly. “It will make you feel so much better.”  
  
  “It will make it worse,” she muttered pathetically as she tightened her hold around her knees, noting with dread that the water was starting to cool off.  
  
  “I promise that it will make it all better,” he crooned softly as he pulled the curtain back slowly and attempted to approach her with the pill and the ginger ale that promised to send her running back to the toilet.  
  
  “I-I can’t,” she muttered, stubbornly turning her head away.  
  
  “You can,” he said, reaching up and turning the water off. “I know it doesn’t feel like it, but this will make you feel so much better.”  
  
  Biting her lip, she shook her head.  
  
&  
nbsp; “It will dissolve very quickly.”  
  
  Another shake of her head.  
  
  “If it doesn’t work, I’ll let you go for my balls?” he offered, promising her the one thing in the world that would make her even consider risking another three hours curled up by the toilet, praying for death that had refused to come.  
  
  “It won’t work,” she argued, swallowing back the bile that threatened to send her crawling out of the bathtub and returning to the spot by the toilet that she was starting to consider hers.  
  
  “It will. The doctor promised that these would take care of your nausea almost immediately,” Trevor said, holding the pill out to her with a hopeful expression that was going to get him slapped.  
  
  “He said the same thing about the last pills,” she reminded him with a barely suppressed shudder as she remembered her reaction to the last prescription that the doctor had called in for her earlier, the one that he’d guaranteed would ease her stomach. The moment that Trevor had returned from the twenty-four hour pharmacy, she’d popped two pills, chased them down with a sip of water and immediately regretted it.  
  
  “I know he did, sweetheart, but I think this will work,” Trevor promised in a cooing tone that had her opening her eyes just so that she could glare at him.  
  
  “How exactly can you make that promise?” she demanded, scowling at the bastard that had done this to her even as she reached out and grudgingly took the pills from him.  
  
  “Because this time I skipped your doctor and went straight to Uncle Ethan,” he explained as though that meant something special to her.  
  
  “How exactly does that help me?” she had to ask as she forced the pill in her mouth, squeezed her eyes shut and accepted a sip of ginger ale from the impregnating bastard all while trying not to remember what happened the last time a pill slid down her throat.  
  
  “Because I refused to leave him alone until he wrote you a prescription for the good shit,” he said, sounding unconcerned as she blindly reached out and slapped her hands against the side of the tub, waiting for the moment when she would pray for death, but…  
  
  It never came.  
  
  “Oh my God,” she mumbled, opening her eyes and taking her first relieved breath in hours since Trevor had offered her an egg salad sandwich, which had triggered some unholy reaction in her body and had sent her running for the bathroom in the first place.  
  
  “Better?” Trevor asked with an approving smile as he held the cup of ginger ale to her.  
  
  “Mmmhmm,” she murmured in agreement as she took a slow sip of the cold soda, nearly moaning in relief when the action didn’t cause her stomach to rebel. “Much better,” she agreed on a sigh, placing a hand over her sore stomach while he pulled the cup away.  
  
  “Why don’t we get you out of there and in something a little more comfortable?” Trevor suggested with a sympathetic murmur that took her by surprise and made her feel so special, because she knew without a doubt that he really loved her and their unborn babies.  
  
  Sniffling back a sob, she shot him a grateful smile and allowed him to help her out of the tub. When he wrapped her in a large fluffy towel, she had to bite her lip to stop herself from doing something silly like crying, something that she was afraid that she was going to end up doing a lot over the next five months.  
  
  “I love you, Trevor,” she found herself saying, unable to keep so much emotion to herself, not right now.  
  
  God, she was pathetic, she thought with a sniffle even as she sent him a shy, watery smile, unable to believe just how lucky she’d been to find someone so sweet and kind like Trevor.  
  
  “I love you, too, sweetheart,” Trevor said soothingly as he wrapped another towel around her and pulled her close so that he could hold her. “I love you so much, Zoe,” he said, making her smile even as she sniffled and closed her eyes, content on staying in the arms of the sweetest man alive.  
  
  \*-\*-\*-\*  
  
  “You. Sick. Bastard!” Zoe snapped, unable to believe that the man trying to drag her away from the kitchen table was the same man who’d held her and whispered how much he loved her as he kissed her only an hour ago.  
  
  “Let go, Zoe,” Trevor said firmly, reaching over to wrestle the maple syrup coated fork out of her hand.  
  
  “No!” she screamed, reluctantly giving up her slippery hold on the fork and grabbed a handful of syrup soaked Eggo waffles, desperate for the buttery sustenance, and took a large, satisfying bite as Trevor continued to pull her away from the table and towards the front door.  
  
  “We’ll grab food afterwards,” Trevor calmly explained as she struggled to get free and grab the last waffle.  
  
  “Just let me finish!” she begged, close to crying when it became obvious that she was never going to get a chance to enjoy that delicious Eggo waffle in all its syrupy glory.  
  
  “I’ll feed you after the ceremony. I promise,” Trevor said, but she wasn’t listening as she went limp and let him drag her away.  
  
  “My waffle,” she whispered with a little sniffle as she was carried outside and loaded in Trevor’s truck where she sadly nibbled on the handful of waffle that she’d managed to save.  
  
  “At least we know the pill works,” Trevor said, sounding oddly triumphant as she sat there, nibbling on her handful of waffle as she glared at him.  
  
  “I hate you,” she bit out evenly, never sure of anything more in her life.  
  
  “Sure you do,” he murmured in agreement, not really sounding all that concerned as he slowly backed out of the driveway.  
  
  “I do,” she mumbled, feeling her bottom lip start to tremble as she finished her last bite of waffle and absently accepted the handful of wet naps that Trevor held out to her.  
  
  “I know you do, sweetheart,” Trevor said, pausing by a stop sign to help clean her hands for her so that she could sit there, trying not to break down in tears, again.  
  
  When her hands were freshly cleaned, she folded her arms over her chest and glared out the window, struggling not to cry and it was working too, until he reached over and took her hand into his. As soon as he touched her, she lost it.  
  
  “Aw, sweetheart, it’s okay,” Trevor said softly as he pulled the truck over, set it in park, somehow managed to unbuckle her seatbelt and pulled her onto his lap. “Shhh, it’s okay, sweetheart.”  
  
  “N-no, it’s not,” she sobbed against his shirt, wondering why she couldn’t seem to stop crying. She felt like she was going crazy. One minute she felt like she was going to be sick, the next she felt like she’d starve to death if she didn’t eat everything in sight, then the next she couldn’t stop crying because she was happy, sad, tired and even cried when she was hungry. She couldn’t seem to stop crying, and God, how she really wished that she could stop crying.  
  
  “You’re just tired, Zoe,” he explained as he held her, kissing her forehead in a way that mildly pleased her.  
  
  Sniffle. “I am a little tired,” she admitted with another sniffle.  
  
  “I know, baby. I know,” Trevor said soothingly as he gently placed her back on her seat and carefully pulled her seatbelt back on her. “Why don’t you close your eyes? We’ll make this quick so that we can get you back home and in bed. How does that sound? Hmmm?”  
  
  Biting her lip, because she was honestly afraid that if she opened her mouth that she was going to further humiliate herself by turning into a blubbering idiot, she nodded and closed her eyes, deciding that perhaps a little nap was exactly what she needed. Snuggling against the door, she released a little yawn as she settled in for a refreshing nap.  
  
  As she felt Trevor pull back into traffic, something occurred to her, something that she should have wondered when he’d rushed her to get dressed, downstairs and out the door at barely six in the morning on their day off.  
  
  “Where exactly are we going?”  
  
  “To the courthouse,” Trevor explained, sounding unconcerned as she sat there, frowning and wondering why they were heading to the courthouse on the weekend when he went ahead and cleared things up for her.  
  
  “I figured we’d get married and just get it over with,” he said with a shrug.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  “No.”  
  
  Sighing, he reached for her hand, “Zoe, if you would just listen. I-”  
  
  “No,” the stubborn woman said with her arms folded over her chest as she continued to glare at the vending machine in front of them.  
  
  Shoving his fingers through his hair, he looked over at his uncle and cousins, but the useless bastards simply continued to stand there, munching on their snacks, watching to see how he was going to handle Zoe without her going for his balls, which he’d technically already given her permission to do.  
  
  “We’re not speaking,” she bit out when he opened his mouth to try and smooth things over.  
  
  Clearing his throat, he shot his Uncle Jared a questioning glance only to find his uncle, leaning back against the back door, nibbling on a bag of Cheetos and looking bored. Great, so much for getting help convincing the woman that he loved that marrying him was for the be  
st. Reluctantly, he shot a glance over to his cousin Jason to find him sitting on one of the wooden benches lining the walls, watching him with what could only be described as a smug expression and letting Trevor know that he wasn’t going to lift a finger to make this any easier for him.  
  
  Great.  
  
  Just fucking great.  
  
  “I’m wearing my oversized grey sweatpants and one of your old tee shirts,” she bit out, every single syllable somehow filled with more rage than the last, which he’d have to admit, was actually impressive.  
  
  Frowning, because he was sure that he was missing something important here, he looked over her baggy outfit, not really seeing the problem and shrugged.  
  
  It was perhaps the single dumbest thing that he’d ever done in his life.  
  
  Her mouth slowly closed until it was obvious that she was clenching her jaw tightly shut as her eyes narrowed on him. She considered him for a long minute, making him wish for the first time in his life that he’d made a habit of wearing an athletic cup, but before he had a chance to cover his balls and drop to the ground where he would most likely curl up into a fetal position, she took them all by surprise.  
  
  She cried.  
  
  “What the hell did you do?” Jason demanded, looking pissed as he shoved past Trevor and put his arm around Zoe, who simply stood there, silently crying, adding a pathetic sniffle here and there while every man in his family glared at him like they were dying to kick his ass.  
  
  “What is wrong with you?” Uncle Jared demanded as he took Zoe by the hand and led her over to the bench by the front doors, giving her a warm smile that only seemed to make her cry harder.  
  
  Jason followed after his father, pausing long enough to slam Trevor in the shoulder and send him a glare before he sat down on Zoe’s other side, taking her small hand in his and trying to comfort the frustrating woman, who couldn’t seem to stop crying.  
  
  “H-he t-tossed the c-clothes to me and told me to get d-dressed,” she managed to get out with a sniffle that for some reason had every one of his relatives shifting their glares back on him.  
  
  “H-he didn’t even tell me where we were going,” she said, pausing to add another one of those sniffles that he was starting to blame the hormones for. “H-he wouldn’t even let me eat. He just told me to get dressed, dragged me down here and said that we were getting married.”  
  
  “That’s more than most women get in our family,” he pointed out with a mumble, expecting some support from the men in his family, but all he ended up getting were more glares, a few more shoulder shoves and a, “Better watch your back, bitch,” from his Great Uncle Theo.  
  
  “I-I understand that I didn’t have much of a choice, b-but I would have liked to have worn something pretty on my wedding day,” she said with a sniffle, further inciting the rage filled glares being shot his way as his mind latched on something she said.  
  
  “Wait, what do you mean that you didn’t have a choice?” he demanded, even though he had to admit, she really didn’t have much of a choice. She was his and that’s all that mattered, but the way she’d said it rubbed him the wrong way.  
  
  “Well,” she said with a sniffle that had his eyes narrowing to slits, “it’s just that I really never thought that I’d end up settling.”  
  
  “Settling?” he repeated back slowly, sure that he’d misheard her.  
  
  She nodded solemnly as he stood there, seething.  
  
  “I know, sweetheart,” Uncle Jason said, giving her hand a comforting pat. “I know.”  
  
  “I know that I don’t have a choice anymore, not with the babies on the way,” she said with a little heartfelt sigh as she placed her hand over her soft stomach, reminding every Bradford in the room that she was carrying two of them and bringing their animosity towards him up another notch and seriously fucking him over. “This just isn’t how I’d pictured my wedding day I guess, pregnant, wearing sweatpants and hungry.”  
  
  “He didn’t feed you?” Jason asked, shifting a glare towards him that should have rightfully killed him on the spot.  
  
  “I made her five goddamn plates of waffles!” he snapped, sick and tired of the fickle bastards screwing him over because of a few sniffles and lip trembles.  
  
  This was a fucking Bradford elopement and they damn well better start remembering that!  
  
  “I-I was still hungry,” she admitted with a beautiful blush and another one of those damn lip trembles that had his eyes narrowing impossibly further.  
  
  “Is the Justice of the Peace ready?” he asked, keeping his eyes locked on the woman that was obviously enjoying screwing him over for her own entertainment.  
  
  “They’re still trying to talk him off the ledge,” one of his cousins said around a yawn even as he continued to glare at Trevor like he was Satan himself.  
  
  “Someone get him down here so that we can get this over with,” he said, forcing himself to bite back a smile when he saw Zoe do the same, clearly enjoying herself, which was fine with him.  
  
  Just as long as she was legally obligated to put up with all his bullshit by the end of the day, she could screw him over however she wanted.  
  
  \*-\*-\*-\*  
  
  “Look, you don’t have to do this,” Uncle Jared said, licking his lips nervously as he shifted an anxious glance towards the double doors leading to the courtroom where Trevor stood, arguing with a group of his cousins and uncles, trying to convince them that he wasn’t neglecting their poor little Zoe.  
  
  “We can get her out through the back,” Jason said, gesturing towards the back doors where only two Bradfords stood guard, but something about the way that they were glaring at Trevor told her that if she really wanted to leave, that they would not only step aside, but they would probably also give her a ride somewhere and buy her breakfast to make sure that she was really okay.  
  
  This really was a sweet family, she thought, biting back another pleased smile as she did her best to look upset about this forced elopement. Never in a million years could she have ever hoped to become part of a family like this, one that enjoyed screwing each other over, but in that same breath would die for one another. They were devoted, loyal and genuinely loved each other. It was more than she could have ever hoped for and she couldn’t wait to be one of them.  
  
  She especially couldn’t wait to belong to the man ignoring his cousins and uncles bitching at him about how he had to take better care of her as he continued to send her smoldering looks that told her that he knew exactly what she was up to and that it was more than fine with him just as long as she left this courthouse knowing exactly who she belonged with.  
  
  Chapter 3  
  
  He. Was. Going. To. Fucking. Throttle. Her.  
  
  The Justice of the Peace looked like he was seconds away from a panic attack.  
  
  Most of his uncles and cousins looked torn between frustration and amusement.  
  
  His Uncle Jared stood there by Zoe’s side, determined to make sure that his “special girl” wasn’t forced to rush into something that she might regret. Since she’d asked him through a teary-eyed smile to stand up for her, the betraying bastard had somehow forgotten that he’d orchestrated a forced trip to the JP of his own, taken part in more than a dozen of these and had been at his house at five this morning with coffee and donuts, explaining the best way to kidnap Zoe and get her to the courthouse on time without her killing him.  
  
  Now the bastard was determined to make sure that Zoe wasn’t rushed into doing something that she might regret later. So, thanks to his asshole uncle’s meddling ways, they were still standing here, waiting for Zoe to answer the damn question!  
  
  “M-miss?” the Justice of the Peace asked with a hesitant stammer as he risked a glance up to find Zoe standing there, worrying her bottom lip as she “thought over her options,” as she’d explained thirty minutes ago to the amusement of his uncles and cousins.  
  
  Narrowing his eyes on his soon-to-be wife, and she would damn well be leaving this court house as his wife, he bit out, “Zoe,” putting everything into that one word.  
  
  Blinking innocently at him, she admitted, “I just wan  
t to make sure that I’ve reviewed all my options before I settle.”  
  
  Lips twitching, he asked, “And?”  
  
  She released a long-suffering sigh as she reluctantly nodded. “I guess we could see where this goes.”  
  
  “You…guess….,” he repeated back dryly, still stunned that a woman like Zoe was able to not only knock him on his ass, but to make him love it.  
  
  She was short, plump, feisty, sarcastic, loved to tease and torment him, couldn’t cook to save her life and he couldn’t wait until she was finally his.  
  
  “I do,” he said firmly, keeping his eyes locked with hers.  
  
  The Justice of the Peace cleared his throat uncomfortably. “I-I haven’t got to that part just yet.”  
  
  “Don’t fucking care,” he said with a smile for the woman that he loved as he reached up, cupped her face and kissed her.  
  
  He heard the Justice of the Peace say something else, heard his Uncle Jared call his name and his cousins tease him, but he refused to stop kissing her, refused to let her go until he heard the words that would make her his.  
  
  “I now pronounce you man and wife,” the Justice of the Peace finally announced, damn near making him sigh with relief as he pulled back, smiling down at his wi-  
  
  “You know,” Zoe said, cutting off his thoughts of triumph with a mischievous smile and that look in her eye that told him that he was seriously about to be fucked over just for shits and giggles, “technically we’re not married until after the wedding night,” she finished with a careless shrug and a yawn.  
  
  He wanted to argue with her, but-  
  
  She was right.  
  
  Shit!  
  
  She wasn’t his, not yet, but he wasn’t worried about it…  
  
  Not at all…

Throwaway and some details changed in case daughter uses Reddit

I (M55) and my exwife (F58) had an ugly divorce when our daughter (F28) was a teen. Her mother remarried almost immediately (affair). I began dating my partner (F60) about a year later. She has several adult children of her own. I get along very well with her children, we spend holidays together, travel together, etc. 

My ex didn't really give our daughter a choice on whether or not she wanted to be around her romantic partner. But as soon as I began dating, my daughter was firm about not wanting to meet her. Because of her mother's actions and the divorce, I agreed.

My partner was sad about this but understood and accepted my decision. After a few years, I began trying to help her get to know my partner and her children. It didn't go well. My daughter is a shy girl and so some of this was expected, although she also was a bit immature. But, after a few bad experiences, my partner asked that we go back to the way things were before. I was under the impression that we would try to blend again in the future.

In the past year or so my daughter has started to heal more from the divorce. She has expressed interest in meeting my partner and her children again, and maybe even celebrating the holidays together.

I was thrilled. But when I brought this up to my partner, she was… unenthusiastic. She was evasive at first but then said that she is happy to ""get lunch or coffee or something"" but doesn't ever want to spend holidays with my daughter. I am trying to understand her perspective but it feels like a kick to the stomach - I know my daughter isn't perfect, but to me, she is rejecting my child.

My partner's viewpoint: Some of her children live farther away and the holidays are when they get to bond and spend time together. Her kids (and I suspect her although she won't admit it) have a negative impression of my daughter. She is open to accompanying me to lunch or a day trip with her. But, my daughter lives across the country, so opportunities for lunch and coffee are not exactly common. Overall, my partner has said she would prefer to continue the way things are.

I have been looking forward to the day everyone comes together for years, and now feel like the rug was pulled out from under me. I am still reeling but am seeking advice on two things:

1. How can my partner and I come to a place on this where both of us are happy? I am not happy to maintain the status quo if my daughter is open to a relationship, but my partner keeps avoiding/shutting down the conversation. I did not expect this at all and am struggling to understand.
2. What do I say to my daughter? She is offering to fly out for a visit, and I do not want to tell her my partner's viewpoint.",0,1755455738.0,relationship_advice,4,0.5,False
1msyqya,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1msyqya/evaluate_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_krups/,Evaluate the Best Drip Coffee Maker KRUPS KM911AU0 Worth It,"Every morning starts with coffee for me, and being a coffee enthusiast, I recently tested the KRUPS KM911AU0. I'm someone who takes brewing seriously—grinding the beans myself, getting the right water temperature, and timing it to perfection. This drip coffee maker boasts many ambitious features that aim to make my life easier all while delivering a cup reminiscent of a barista-crafted brew. The question is, does this sleek-looking machine live up to its bold promises? Spoiler: kind of. Keep reading for the highs and lows of my experience.

**Modern Design Paired with Practicality**  
The silver stainless steel body immediately caught my attention. While it has a modern, polished finish that fits seamlessly into a minimalist kitchen, I also found it compact enough for my medium-sized countertop. I had concerns about cleaning in the nooks and crannies, but every piece that comes in contact with coffee—including the carafe, shower head, filter holder, and their much-lauded aroma tube—is removable and dishwasher-safe. Not having to soak tiny parts or scrub awkward places is a win for me!

**Performance: Does It Deliver Barista-Quality Coffee?**  
The defining feature of this machine is its blooming technology. Unlike standard drip coffee machines, it pre-soaks the grounds before brewing to release trapped carbon dioxide. It's like giving your coffee a warm-up lap before the race begins, and yes, it does enhance the final taste. My coffee consistently came out rich and well-rounded, even with store-bought pre-ground coffee. I could also truly appreciate the five-hole shower head. This feature ensured even extraction of the coffee grounds and added an enhanced sweetness to each brew. My colleague (who joined in on the tasting) described it as a ""smooth yet vibrant cup."" 

**Ease of Use and Settings**  
Let me talk about the simplicity built into this machine. With only a few programmable buttons, the KRUPS KM911AU0 doesn’t overwhelm you with endless options. I tested the “half-drip mode,” which guarantees a richer extraction when brewing smaller batches. It was great for those times I only needed two cups for myself. Additionally, there’s an auto keep-warm function that adjusts heat based on the batch size. This was incredibly thoughtful—no scorched tasting coffee when I brewed less. That said, there’s no permanent filter included—it requires regular #4 cone paper filters, sold separately. Be sure to stock up, or you might find yourself at 6 a.m. rifling through drawers in a caffeine-deprived panic.

[Check KRUPS KM911AU0 price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b0dv7ctd6c/)

**Merits**  
- Pre-soak blooming function enhances flavor quality
- Compact size and beautiful design fit most kitchens
- All removable components are dishwasher safe, making cleanup a breeze
- Five-hole shower head ensures even coffee extraction
- Multiple brewing modes cater to varying taste preferences and batch sizes  

**Negatives**  
- Does not include a permanent filter, making long-term costs slightly higher
- The ""descale reminder light"" can only be cleared after running a specific cleaning cycle, which some people (me included, briefly) might miss in the manual  

**Technology That Guides Maintenance**  
This coffee maker has a built-in maintenance helper I didn’t know I needed—the blinking light that reminds you it’s time to descale. Although I wasn’t thrilled about being bossed around by my coffee maker, it's a useful touch when you think about maintaining long-term performance. From my experience, after running the suggested cleaning instructions, the reminder faded, and the machine resumed its regular operation. 

**Industry Competitors**  
Over the years, I’ve tried competitors like the Technivorm Moccamaster and Bonavita Connoisseur, both of which sit at a slightly higher price point. The main difference here is consistency. While the Moccamaster arguably has superior, faster brewing, the KRUPS KM911AU0 offers a blooming function that extracted more sweetness in side-by-side tests. It beats many rivals in cleanability as the dishwasher-safe parts save a lot of hassle compared to others that aren’t quite so user-friendly. On the other hand, the Bonavita wins for simple, stripped-down brewing without programmable bells and whistles. Deciding between them comes down to whether you value the ability to tweak flavors and that signature blooming tech.

**Value Proposition**  
Cost is where this machine feels fair, but not groundbreaking. It manages to toe the fine line between premium quality and smart spending. Similar products with SCA certification and a host of performance features usually climb much higher in price, leaving this coffee maker sitting in a sweet middle-ground. Do I think it justifies its price for most people? Absolutely, especially for those who enjoy customizable brewing but don’t want to spend aggressively for a device.

It is not a professional network, it is a high school popularity contest dressed up in business casual. Every single post is the same recycled garbage. “I’m humbled to announce.” “Grateful for this opportunity.” “Failure is just success in disguise.” Stop lying. Nobody believes you are humbled. Nobody believes you “failed forward.” You are just performing.

The site is one giant stage play of fake positivity, corporate jargon, and clout chasing. People write five paragraph essays about how handing someone a stapler taught them the meaning of leadership. They post a picture of a coffee cup and somehow stretch it into a motivational speech about synergy. They treat it like it is TED Talk Twitter.

And the self-congratulation is unbearable. Every promotion is “I could not have done it without my amazing team.” Yes you could have, because you stepped on half of them to get there. Every “I’m excited to announce” is code for “Look at me, peasants, I am climbing the ladder and you are not.” Recruiters hover in the feed like vultures, tossing out generic job descriptions like chum in the water.

LinkedIn is not about connecting. It is about branding yourself like a product, faking enthusiasm for companies that would replace you tomorrow, and applauding mediocrity because someone figured out how to add emojis to their headline. It is a circus of hollow congratulations and manufactured humility. And the worst part is that everyone plays along because if you do not, you risk looking “unprofessional.”

I’m hoping to meet some new people locally and make a few friends to hang out with. A bit about me:

* I cycle now and then, nothing too serious, just casual rides.
* I’ve been on a bit of a health kick recently, so I’ve been cooking more and trying to stay active.
* I enjoy reading and aimless wandering around Liverpool, finding new spots.
* I’m into gaming — mainly PC and Switch, and I play a lot of WoW.

  August i6th, 1793  
  
  The city of Philadelphia is perhaps one of the wonders of the world.  
  
  \-Lord Adam Gordon Journal entry, 1765  
  
  I woke to the sound of a mosquito whining in my left ear and my mother screeching in the right.  
  
  ""Rouse yourself this instant!""  
  
  Mother snapped open the shutters and heat poured into our bedchamber. The room above our coffeehouse was not large. Two beds, a washstand, and a wooden trunk with frayed leather straps nearly filled it. It seemed even smaller with Mother storming around.  
  
  ""Get out of bed, Matilda,"" she continued. ""You're sleeping the day away."" She shook my shoulder. ""Polly's late and there's work to be done.""  
  
  The noisy mosquito darted between us. I started to sweat under the thin blanket. It was going to be another hot August day. Another long, hot August day. Another  
  
  3  
  
  long, hot, boring, wretched August day.  
  
  ""I can't tell who is lazier, Polly or you,"" Mother muttered as she stalked out of the room. ""When I was a girl, we were up before the sun ..."" Her voice droned on and on as she clattered down the stairs.  
  
  I groaned. Mother had been a perfect girl. Her family was wealthy then, but that didn't stop her from stitching entire quilts before breakfast, or spinning miles of wool before tea. It was the War, she liked to remind me. Children did what was asked of them. And she never complained. Oh, no, never. Good children were seen and not heard. How utterly unlike me.  
  
  I yawned and stretched, then snuggled back onto my pillow. A few more minutes' rest, that's what I needed. I'd float back to sleep, drifting like Blanchard's giant yellow balloon. I could just see it: the winter's day, the crowds on the rooftops, the balloon tugging at its ropes. I held my breath. Would the ropes break?  
  
  The devilish mosquito attacked, sinking its needlenose into my forehead.  
  
  ""Ow!""  
  
  I leapt from my bed, and-thunk!-cracked my head on the sloped ceiling. The ceiling was lower than it used to be. Either that, or I had grown another inch overnight. I sat back down, wide awake now, my noggin sporting two lumps-one from the ceiling, one from the mosquito.  
  
  No balloon trips for me.  
  
  To work, then. I got to my feet and crossed the room, ducking my head cautiously. The water in the washbasin was cloudy, and the facecloth smelled like old cheese. I decided to clean up later, perhaps next December.  
  
  A squeaking mouse dashed by my toes, followed by a flash of orange fur named Silas. The mouse ran to a corner, its claws scratching desperately on the floorboards. Silas pounced. The squeaking stopped.  
  
  ""Oh, Silas! Did you have to do that?""  
  
  Silas didn't answer. He rarely did. Instead he jumped up on Mother's quilt and prepared to pick apart his breakfast.  
  
  Mother's best quilt. Mother abhorred mice.  
  
  I sprang across the room. ""Get down!"" I commanded.  
  
  Silas hissed at me but obeyed, leaping to the floor and padding out the door.  
  
  ""Matilda?"" Mother's voice called up the stairs.  
  
  ""Now!""  
  
  I made a face at the doorway. I had just saved her precious quilt from disaster, but would she appreciate it? Of course not.  
  
  No more dawdling. I had to get dressed.  
  
  I fastened my stays and a badly embroidered pocket over the white shift I slept in. Then I stepped into my blue linen skirt. It nearly showed my ankles. Along with the ceiling getting lower, my clothes were shrinking, too.  
  
  4  
  
  Once dressed, I faced the rather dead mouse and wrinkled my nose. Picking it up by the tail, I carried the corpse to the front window and leaned out.  
  
  My city, Philadelphia, was wide awake. My heart beat faster and my head cleared. Below the window, High Street teemed with horsemen, carriages, and carts. I could hear Mrs. Henning gossiping on her front stoop and dogs barking at a pig running loose in the street.  
  
  The sound of the blacksmith's hammer on his anvil reminded me of Polly, our tardy serving girl. That's where she was, no doubt; in the blacksmith's shop, eyeing Matthew, the blacksmith's son. I didn't like it there. The roaring furnace, sparks crackling in the air, the sizzle of hot metal into cold water-it all reminded me of that unmentionable place the preachers liked to go on about.  
  
  My favorite place was the waterfront. I squinted eastward. The rooftop of the State House, where the Congress met, was visible, but the August haze and dust from the street made it impossible to see farther than that. On a clear day, I could see the masts of the ships tied up at the wharves on the Delaware River. I promised myself a secret visit to the docks later, as soon as Polly arrived to distract Mother.  
  
  A few blocks south lay the Walnut Street Prison, where Blanchard had flown that remarkable balloon. From the prison's courtyard it rose, a yellow silk bubble escaping the earth. I vowed to do that one day, slip free  
  
  4  
  
  of the ropes that held me. Nathaniel Benson had heard me say it, but he did not laugh. He understood. Perhaps I would see him at the docks, sketching a ship or sea gulls. It had been a long time since we talked.  
  
  But before I went anywhere, there was a dead mouse to dispose of. I couldn't throw it into High Street; it might spook one of the horses. I crossed the room and opened the back window overlooking the garden. Maybe Silas would smell his treat out there and get a decent breakfast after all. I flung the corpse as far as I could, then hurried downstairs before Mother boiled  
  
  over.

  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  August i6th, 1793  
  
  ... thefirst and most principal to be, a perfect skill and knowledge in cookery... because it is a duty well belonging to women.  
  
  \-Gervase Markham The English House Wife, 1668  
  
  A soon as I stepped into the kitchen, Mother started her lecture.  
  
  ""Too much sleep is bad for your health, Matilda."" She slipped a freshly made ball of butter into a stone crock. ""It must be a grippe, a sleeping sickness.""  
  
  I tried not to listen to her. I had not cleared the wax from my ears all summer, hoping it would soften her voice. It had not worked.  
  
  ""You should be dosed with fish oil. When I was a girl ..."" She kept talking to herself as she carried a steaming pot of water outside to rinse the butter churn.  
  
  I sat down at the table. Our kitchen was larger than most, with an enormous hearth crowded with pots and kettles, and two bake ovens built into the brickwork beside it. The size of the room did not match the size of our family. We were only three: Mother, Grandfather, and me, plus Eliza who worked for us. But the roomy kitchen could feed one hundred people in a day. My family owned the Cook Coffeehouse. The soon-to-be famous Cook Coffeehouse, Grandfather liked to say.  
  
  My father had built our home and business after the War for Independence ended in 1783. I was four years old. The coffeehouse sat just off the corner of Seventh and High Streets. At first we were lucky if a lost farmer strayed in, but business improved when President Washington's house was built two blocks away.  
  
  Father was a carpenter by trade, and he built us a sturdy home. The room where we served customers filled most of the first floor and had four large windows. The kitchen was tucked into the back, filled with useful shelves and built-in cupboards to store things. We could have used a sitting room, truth be told. Father would have added one on if he had lived. But he fell off a ladder and died of a broken neck two months after the coffeehouse opened. That's when Grandfather joined us.  
  
  A coffeehouse was a respectable business for a widow and her father-in-law to run. Mother refused to serve spirits, but she allowed card games and a small bit of gambling as long as  
she didn't have to see it. By midday the front room was usually crowded with gentlemen, merchants, and politicians enjoying a cup of coffee, a  
  
  6  
  
  bite to eat, and the news of the day. Father would have been proud. I wondered what he would have thought of me.  
  
  ""Good morning,"" Eliza said loudly, startling me. ""I thought you were going to sleep the day away. Have you eaten?"" She set a sack of coffee beans on the table.  
  
  ""I'm starving,"" I said, clutching my stomach.  
  
  ""As usual,"" she said with a smile. ""Let me get you something quick.""  
  
  Eliza was the coffeehouse cook. Mother couldn't prepare a meal fit for pigs. I found this amusing, considering our last name was Cook. In a manner, though, it was serious. If not for Eliza's fine victuals, and the hungry customers who paid to eat them, we'd have been in the streets long ago. Mother's family had washed their hands of her when she ran off to marry a carpenter, a tradesman (the horror!), when she was but seventeen. So we were very fond of Eliza.  
  
  Like most blacks in Philadelphia, Eliza was free. She said Philadelphia was the best city for freed slaves or freeborn Africans. The Quakers here didn't hold with slavery and tried hard to convince others that slavery was against God's will. Black people were treated different than white people, that was plain to see, but Eliza said nobody could tell her what to do or where to go, and no one would ever, ever beat her again.  
  
  She had been born a slave near Williamsburg, Virginia. Her husband saved up his horseshoeing  
  
  8  
  
  money and bought her freedom right after they were married. She told me that was the best day of her life. She moved to Philadelphia and cooked for us, saving her wages to set her husband free.  
  
  When I was eight, she got a letter saying her husband had been killed by a runaway horse. That was her worst day. She didn't say a word for months. My father had only been dead two years, so Mother knew just what lay in Eliza's heart. They both supped sorrow with a big spoon, that's what Mother said. It took years, but the smile slowly returned to Eliza's face. She didn't turn sour like Mother did.  
  
  Eliza was the luckiest person I knew. She got to walk from the river past shop windows, market stalls, and the courthouse up to Seventh Street every morning. She told stories even better than Grandfather, and she knew how to keep a secret. She laughed once when I told her she was my best friend, but it was the truth.  
  
  She dished up a bowl of oatmeal from a pot that hung by the side of the hearth, then carefully set it in front of me. ""Eat up,"" she said. One corner of her mouth turned up just a bit and she winked.  
  
  I tasted the oatmeal. It was sweet. Eliza had hidden a sugar lump at the bottom of the bowl.  
  
  ""Thank you,"" I whispered.  
  
  ""You're welcome,"" she whispered back.  
  
  ""Why is Polly late?"" I asked. ""Have you seen her?""  
  
  Eliza shook her head. ""Your mother is in a lather, I  
  
  7  
  
  promise you,"" she warned. ""If Polly doesn't get here soon, she may need to find herself another position.""  
  
  ""I bet she's dawdling by the forge,"" I said, ""watching Matthew work with his shirt collar open.""  
  
  ""Maybe she's ill,"" Eliza said. ""There's talk of sickness by the river.""  
  
  Mother strode into the room carrying wood for the fire.  
  
  ""Serving girls don't get sick,"" Mother said. ""If she doesn't appear soon, you'll have to do her chores as well as your own, Matilda. And where is your grandfather? I sent him to inquire about a box of tea an hour ago. He should have returned by now.""  
  
  ""I'd be happy to search for him,"" I offered. ""I could look for Polly, too.""  
  
  Mother added wood to the fire, poking the logs until the flames jumped. The delicate tip of her shoe tapped impatiently. ""No. I'll go. If Father comes back, don't let him leave. And Matilda, see to the garden.""  
  
  She quickly tied a bonnet under her chin and left, the back door closing behind her with the sharp sound of a musket shot.  
  
  ""Well,"" said Eliza. ""That's it, then. Here, have some veal and corn bread. Seems like you've a long day ahead of you.""  
  
  After she cut me two slices of cold veal and a thick piece of fresh corn bread, Eliza started to make gingerbread, one of her specialties. Nutmeg and cinnamon  
  
  10  
  
  perfumed the air as she ground the spices with a pestle. If not for the heat, I could have stayed in the kitchen for an eternity. The house was silent except for the popping of the applewood in the fire, and the tall clock ticking in the front room. I took a sip from a half-filled mug on the table.  
  
  ""Ugh! It's coffee!"" Black coffee, bitter as medicine. ""How can you drink this?"" I asked Eliza.  
  
  ""It tastes better if you don't steal it,"" she answered. She took the cup from my hands. ""Pour your own and leave mine be.""  
  
  ""Are we out of cider?"" I asked. ""I could get some at the marketplace.""  
  
  ""Oh, no,"" Eliza said. ""You'll stay right here. Your mother needs your help, and that poor garden is like to expire. It is time for you to haul some water, little Mattie.""  
  
  Little Mattie indeed. Another month and I'd be almost as tall as Eliza. I hated to be called ""little.""  
  
  I sighed loudly, put my dishes in the washtub, and tucked my hair into my mob cap. I tied a disreputable straw hat atop the cap, one I could never wear in the street, and snatched a bite of dough from Eliza's bowl before I ran outside.  
  
  The garden measured fifty paces up one side and twenty along the other, but after six weeks of drought it seemed as long and wide as a city block, filled with thousands of drooping plants crying for help.  
  
  8  
  
  I dropped the bucket into the well to fill it with water, then turned the handle to bring it back up again. Little Mattie, indeed. I was big enough to be ordered around like an unpaid servant. Big enough for mother to grumble about finding me a husband.  
  
  I carried the water to the potato patch and poured it out too fast. Big enough to plan for the day when I would no longer live here.  
  
  If I was going to work as hard as a mule, it might as well be for my own benefit. I was going to travel to France and bring back fabric and combs and jewelry that the ladies of Philadelphia would swoon over. And that was just for the dry goods store. I wanted to own an entire city block-a proper restaurant, an apothecary, maybe a school, or a hatter's shop. Grandfather said I was a Daughter of Liberty, a real American girl. I could steer my own ship. No one would call me little Mattie. They would call me ""Ma'am.""  
  
  ""Dash it all."" I had watered a row of weeds.  
  
  As I returned to the well, Mother came through the garden gate.  
  
  ""Where's Polly?"" I asked as I dropped the bucket down the well. ""Did you pass by the blacksmith's?""  
  
  ""I spoke with her mother, with Mistress Logan,"" Mother answered softly, looking at her neat rows of carrots.  
  
  ""And?"" I waved a mosquito away from my face.  
  
  ""It happened quickly. Polly sewed by candlelight after dinner. Her mother repeated that over and over, 'she sewed by candlelight after dinner.' And then she collapsed.""  
  
  I released the handle and the bucket splashed, a distant sound.  
  
  ""Matilda, Polly's dead.""

  CHAPTER THREE  
  
  August 16th, 1793  
  
  Oh then the hands of the pitiful Mother prepared her Child's body for the grave... -Letter of Margaret Morris Philadelphia, 1793  
  
  Dead? Polly's dead?"" I couldn't have heard her properly. ""Polly Logan?"" The sweat on my neck turned to ice and I shivered. ""Our Polly? That can't be.""  
  
  I tried to remember the last time we had played together. It was before she started working for us. Last Christmas-no, well before that. Her family had moved to Third Street at least two years ago. She had been a cradle friend, the girl I played dolls with. We sang nonsense songs together when we churned butter. I could see it then, my small hands and Polly's together on the handle of the churn. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.  
  
  Mother led me inside by the elbow and I sat heavily on a chair. She quickly told Eliza what  
happened.  
  
  ""There was no doctor in attendance,"" Mother  
  
  14  
  
  explained. ""She shook with fever briefly, three quarters of an hour, cried out once, and died in her own bed. They don't know what it was.""  
  
  ""It could have been anything. There are so many fevers at summer's end,"" Eliza said. ""Is anyone else in the house sick?""  
  
  ""Sick with grief,"" Mother said. She poured herself and Eliza each a mug of coffee. ""It's a large family, she still has seven children under ten years, one a babe in her arms.  
  
  ""We'll pray they don't take sick,"" Eliza said as she took the mug. ""Are any neighbors ill?""  
  
  Mother blew in her cup and nodded. ""An old man who lives across the alley is rumored to be sick in bed, but you know how these stories catch fire. It's strange though. She was a healthy girl, robust. Never saw her so much as sneeze before.""  
  
  I kept my eyes closed, trying to see Polly happy, joking, maybe stealing a kiss with Matthew, then bursting through the door to tell me. It couldn't be real. How could Polly be dead?  
  
  ""Matilda, are you well?"" asked Mother. ""She looks peculiar, don't you think, Eliza? Are you feverish?"" She laid her hand on my forehead. Her fingers were rough but cool, and smelled faintly of lavender. I wanted to lay my head on her shoulder, but that would have been awkward.  
  
  Mother slipped her hand to the back of my neck.  
  
  '5  
  
  10  
  
  ""She did not suffer, Matilda. We must be grateful for that."" She removed her hand and peered into my eyes. ""This heat is not healthy. You must tell me straight away if you feel peckish.""  
  
  I waited for her to say something more about Polly. She did not.  
  
  ""We should send along something for the family,"" suggested Eliza. ""Her mother is in no condition to cook. Mattie could take a ham over.""  
  
  ""No,"" Mother said quickly. She set the coffee mug on the table with a thump. ""I don't want her near there, not with a sickness in the air. Besides, she hasn't played with Polly for years. The girl was our servant, not a friend.

Yes, she was,"" I protested. ""Let me go, please. I'll take some food, you know they need it, and I'll pay my respects to her mother. It's the proper thing to do.""  
  
  ""I've already paid our respects,"" Mother said. ""You'll just upset her mother more. I'll take a food basket there myself. Tomorrow. Now put on a clean apron, Matilda, and wash your hands. It's time to get to work.""  
  
  ""I want to see her!""  
  
  ""No.""  
  
  ""What about the funeral?"" I asked, blinking back the tears. ""You must let me attend that.""  
  
  ""No. Absolutely not. I forbid it. You'll have nightmares.""  
  
  ""She was my friend! You must allow me. Why are you so horrid?""  
  
  16  
  
  As soon as the angry words were out of my mouth, I knew I had gone too far.  
  
  ""Matilda!"" Mother rose from her chair. ""You are forbidden to speak to me in that tone! Apologize at once.""  
  
  The sun coming in the south window cast deep shadows under her eyes and cheekbones. She held her jaw tight, her eyes flashing with anger. She looked old, much older than she should. She hadn't always been so pinch-faced and harsh.  
  
  When Mother allowed herself a still moment by the fire on winter nights, I could sometimes see the face she wore when Father was alive. Back then Mother smiled at me with her eyes and her laughter and her gentle hands. But no longer. Life was a battle, and Mother a tired and bitter captain. The captain I had to obey.  
  
  ""My apologies,"" I said.

  \-Amelia Simmons American Cookbook, 1796  
  
  By midafternoon the front room of the coffeehouse was thick with customers, pipe smoke, and loud arguments. A ship's captain finished telling a yarn, and the windowpanes rattled with laughter. Mother poured him a cup of coffee with a steady hand. She looked up as I walked by carrying a tray of fresh gingerbread, but she wouldn't meet my eye.  
  
  ""Over here, lass!"" Grandfather shouted from his corner seat. Above his head hung the cage of King George, the scraggly green parrot won in a card game. ""Bring those delectables over here and give us a kiss.""  
  
  My Grandfather was Captain William Farnsworth  
  
  18  
  
  Cook of the Pennsylvania Fifth Regiment. He was a stout man, thanks to Eliza's cooking, and the heart of all gossip and tall tales in the coffeehouse. He had been an army officer his whole life, and was happiest when serving under General Washington. He tried to instill some military training in me, but always sweetened it with candy.  
  
  I held the tray over my head as I squeezed past the crowded tables. Grandfather sat with two government officials, a lawyer, and Mr. Carris, who owned an export business. I set the tray in front of Grandfather, and he patted my hand.  
  
  ""Look here, gentlemen, sweets offered by the sweetest filly in the Commonwealth. What will you have?""  
  
  ""Can that be little Mattie?"" elderly Mr. Carris asked as he squinted through his bifocals. ""Why, she's grown into a fine young lady. Much too fine for this type of work. We'll have to find a husband for you.""  
  
  ""A husband! A husband!"" King George squawked.  
  
  My face flushed as the men laughed.  
  
  ""Hush, you old thing,"" I muttered to the bird. It would have been rude to hush Mr. Carris. ""I'll feed you to Silas if you don't close that beak.""  
  
  Grandfather gave the pest a piece of gingerbread, and Mr. Carris went back to his original subject.  
  
  ""It's that heap of rotting coffee beans on Ball's Wharf, I tell you,"" Mr. Carris said to the other men. ""It's the source of a deadly miasma, a foul stench, indeed.  
  
  12  
  
  There are noxious fumes all around the district. Mark my words, it will be a killer yet.""  
  
  Is that what killed Polly? A miasma? I could feel the tears stinging my eyes, but I couldn't escape, not with Grandfather holding my hand. I wanted to tell him what happened; he'd understand. But not in front of all these people.  
  
  The lawyer shook his head in disagreement.  
  
  ""It creates an awful stench, yes, but no one dies from a bad smell. If they did, every farmer spreading manure would be long dead and us city-dwellers all hungry!""  
  
  Grandfather roared with laughter and slapped his knee.  
  
  ""Hungry,"" echoed King George.  
  
  ""Hold there, Marks, hold there, I say,"" interjected the government clerk. His left eye blinked with a nervous twitch. ""I've heard stories of a fever among the Santo Domingan refugees. They live close to Ball's Wharf, you know.""  
  
  A doctor at the next table looked up from his backgammon board and interrupted the conversation.  
  
  ""It is not just the refugees,"" the doctor said. ""This morning I spoke with a colleague who was called to the Shewall home. Mary Shewall died soon after of a bilious fever, and one could hardly fault her character. There may well be a disease in the air again. Yellow fever.""  
  
  The room grew quiet as the entire company listened in.  
  
  20  
  
  ""A woman dies of some illness and you talk of yellow fever?"" the lawyer asked. ""We haven't seen yellow fever in Philadelphia for thirty years.""  
  
  ""It is too early to tell,"" the doctor agreed. ""But I know of some who are sending their wives and children up to the country, to healthful air and cool breezes.""  
  
  ""You doctors are all alike, scaring us to earn more business. My family will stay right where they are, thank you,"" the lawyer replied.  
  
  ""All the same, a trip to the country sounds refreshing,"" Mr. Carris said.  
  
  Grandfather thumped his boot on the floor.  
  
  ""Balderdash! Bad coffee is a nuisance, but it won't kill anyone. Some poor soul dies of a fever every August. That's why my boy had the good sense to open this fine establishment so far away from the river, away from the smells, filth, and disease. Enough fever talk. Mattie girl, bring us more tea. And who will tell me why Mr. Jefferson wants to quit his job? Isn't being secretary of state good enough for him? Or does he want something more?""  
  
  The men all shouted. They loved to argue about Mr. Jefferson.  
  
  I fetched a fresh pot of coffee from the kitchen. Eliza and Mother didn't say a word to me; there was too much work to do. I poured coffee and tea, served oyster loaf and Indian pudding, carried the dirty dishes back to Eliza, and tried to keep the floor swept clean. I didn't  
  
  13  
  
  have time to worry about fevers or husbands or rude parrots.  
  
  Eventually the hour struck and the customers donned their hats and said their farewells. Mother called me to help figure the bills and exchange the many kinds of money: pence from Massachusetts, shillings from Virginia, British pounds, and French francs.  
  
  I double-checked the long column of numbers. Taking care of accounts was one territory that Mother conceded to me. If she added the fingers on one hand, she was just as likely to total four as six.  
  
  Grandfather left for his constitutional stroll around the city, but I was not allowed to join him. I had to take Polly's place in the kitchen, washing up, sweeping the floors, dusting the tables, and putting everything back in its proper place so we would be ready to do the same thing the next day.  
  
  My arms felt as heavy as lead from carrying the trays. My shift was sticky with perspiration, and I smelled of tobacco smoke and unwashed strangers. How did Polly do this every day?  
  
  I forced my eyes open to look at Mother putting away the clean china.  
  
  Til help,"" I said.  
  
  ""Don't be ridiculous,"" she answered. ""You're exhausted. Polly wul do it in the morning.""  
  
  She stopped. The house was silent for a moment, except for the sound of Matthew down the block still  
  
  22  
  
  hammering away at his forge. Had anyone told him that Polly was gone?  
  
  ""I'll finish it,"" Mother corrected herself. ""Go to bed. I need you up early to clean out the fireplace.""

  August 24th, 1793  
  
  A lo

  \-Hannah More  
  
  The Young Lady Abroad or Affectionate  
  
  Advice on the Social and Moral Habits of Females, 1777  
  
  A week later, sixty-four people had died, though no one seemed quite sure what killed them. Rumors of a fever near the docks snaked through the city. People avoided the shops by the river and came up to our end of High Street, where the air smelled cleaner. They made our strongbox grow delightfully heavy.  
  
  There was little time to mourn for Polly. I slaved from dawn until the stars shone: house chores in the morning, serving coffee in the afternoon, and cleaning after supper. Sleep became more precious to me than food. One night, I fell asleep in the necessary and woke with a fervent prayer of thanks that I had not fallen in.  
  
  24  
  
  My first chance for escape came eight days after Polly died, as Mother and Grandfather discussed their plans for the day.  
  
  ""We need extra eggs, hard cheese, pippin apples, and savory. And lemons. I'll have to go to the market again,"" sighed Mother. I concentrated on a hoe cake spread thick with honey.  
  
  ""You're too tired, Lucille. Send the child to market,"" Grandfather suggested.  
  
  I quickly swallowed the hoe cake.  
  
  ""No, Matilda must stay home. I shall go."" Mother fanned herself with her hand. ""It is uncommonly warm, isn't it?""  
  
  I jumped to my feet.  
  
  ""Grandfather's right, you need the rest. Please let me  
  
  go-""  
  
  Mother tapped her finger on the table, a good sign.  
  
  She was thinking.  
  
  Grandfather tried again.  
  
  ""You've fussed for days because you don't like her serving customers. Let her run the market errands. It will clear her head. Young people need the outside air.""  
  
  The fingers stopped. A bad sign.  
  
  ""I was thinking of sending her to the country, to the Ludingtons at Gwynedd. You encourage her to go deeper into town."" Mother frowned.  
  
  The Ludingtons? The Ludingtons had a farm with disgusting pigs and dogs that bit. Any place  
  
  15  
  
  would be better than the Ludingtons.  
  
  Grandfather fed a cracker to King George.  
  
  ""Must you be so gloomy, woman? You see darkness in every corner. Sending her away-your own child? You shock me. The Ludingtons aren't even family. I can't see the wisdom in that. We'll have to consider this at some length,"" he said, drawing out his pipe.  
  
  The considering could take hours. The sun was growing hotter and the larder stood empty.  
  
  ""If I don't go soon, everything will be sold or spoiled,"" I reminded them. ""People don't stop eating eggs whenever there's a fever, do they?"" I had to get her attention away from that farm.  
  
  ""The child's right, Lucille. She'll be fine. We must accommodate our lives to the fever for a few weeks, but we shan't overthrow our daily routines. It's important that we not lose our heads.""  
  
  ""But Polly..."" Mother started.  
  
  ""Whatever took that little imp away, it wasn't a fever, I promise you that,"" Grandfather said. ""It could have been a sudden pleurisy or a weak heart. You worry too much. Always have. The market is the safest place in town, next to our own castle here. Now let the child get some air.""  
  
  Mother pursed her lips a moment, then nodded. ""I'll write a list for you.""  
  
  ""I know what we need,"" I quickly replied.  
  
  ""Don't shop at any stalls below Third Street. Stay  
  
  26  
  
  away from Second Street Market completely. And no rambles today. You go to the market and then you come home. And do not let me hear of you loitering shamelessly in front of the Peale house.""  
  
  I turned so she would not see me blush. Why did it matter if I walked past the Peaks'? ""I think we should buy extra bread at the Simmons' bakery. We're sure to run out again.""  
  
  ""Good idea, girl,"" said Grandfather. ""See there, Lucille. The child minds the shop as well as you. You mustn't be so hard on her. Come here, Mattie, give this old soldier a kiss.""  
  
  I pecked his cheek and he slipped a piece of hard candy into my hand. I dashed out the door before Mother could change her mind.  
  
  As I crossed Fourth Street, the noise from the market splashed over me like a wave.  
  
  '""Ere's yer lily-white hot corn! Get your nice hot corn!""  
  
  ""Fresh fish fit for the pan!"" ""Raaaaaaspberries! Blaaaaaaackberries!"" ""Pepperpot! All hot! Makee strong! Makee live long! Come buy my pepperpot!""  
  
  The market stalls stretched for three blocks in the center of the street. West Indian women stood by their pepperpot kettles stirring fragrant stews, while the hot corn girls walked up and down the street. The distant  
  
  16  
  
  call of the charcoal man's horn sounded at the far end of the market. Chickens clucked and geese honked, customers argued about the price of pears, and children ran everywhere.  
  
  Eggs, pippins, savory, what else did she want? I thought. Cabbage? Crab apples? I rolled the candy in my mouth. It had a piece of tobacco stuck to it from Grandfather's pocket. I spit it out and walked up to the egg sellers.  
  
  ""Hello, Miss Matilda Cook!""  
  
  ""Good morning, Mrs. Epler.""  
  
  Mr. and Mrs. Epler were German farmers who brought their eggs and chickens to market three times a week. Mrs. Epler fluttered in her stall, her tiny black eyes looking this way and that, her chins flapping as she spoke. Mr. Epler was egg-shaped; narrow at the top and bottom, bulging in the middle. He never spoke.  
  
  His wife leaned forward.  
  
  ""I was just telling Epler here that your people would be already gone. All the farmers talk, talk, talk of this fever."" She waved her arms, scaring the chickens in their wooden pens at her feet. ""So much fever talk!""  
  
  ""Don't you believe it?"" I asked.  
  
  ""Them that are sick should the church visit. City folk, sinners at the docks. They don't visit the church, and God gives them the fever. It is a sign from God. The Bible says the soul that sinneth, it shall die.""  
  
  Mr. Epler nodded his head solemnly.  
  
  28  
  
  ""Did you to church go last week, Miss Matilda Cook?"" Mrs. Epler leaned her beak forward.  
  
  ""Yes, Ma'am. Mother never lets me stay home.""  
  
  Mrs. Epler's face broke into a wide grin.  
  
  ""She's a good woman, your mother. You go to church and you have no worries! How many eggs you want, liebcheri?""  
  
  With the eggs carefully tucked in my basket, I moved on to Mr. Owens's stall. He wrung his hands and apologized for the sorry-looking cabbages.  
  
  ""We were lucky to get those, what with this drought and all,"" he said.  
  
  He was so discouraged about the cabbages, it was easy to talk his price down. He may have lowered it even further, but I felt sorry for him. He had more children on his farm than he could count on two hands. (The extra money was just what I needed to buy a bag of hard candy. Without tobacco specks.)  
  
  The next stall had fresh lemons. I scratched the peel and held one up to my nose. Paris would smell like a lemon peel, far away and wonderful. I bought a dozen and kept one in my hand as I shopped.  
  
  There was no savory to be found, and the apples were small and knobbly. Mrs. Hotchkiss charged an outrageous price for a moldy cheese, but there were no other cheese sellers. I had to use all the hard candy money. I did not bid her good day.  
  
  As I rounded the butcher's stall at the far end of the  
  
  17  
  
  market, someone grabbed my basket and spun me around. I clenched my fists and whirled to face my assailant.  
  
  Nathaniel Benson.  
  
  My stomach flipped over like an egg in a skillet. I brushed my hands on my apron.  
  
  ""Little Mattie is come to market. Are you sure you haven't lost your way?"" he teased.  
  
  Nathaniel Benson.  
  
  He looked much more a man and less a boy than he had a few months earlier. He had sprouted up over my head and grown broad in the chest. Stop, I cautioned myself. You shouldn't look at him as if he were a racehorse for sale. But his hair was a beautiful chestnut color....  
  
  I often walked past  
the Peaks' house, but rarely had the chance to speak with him. His work as a painter's assistant required long hours. He was known to stroll past the coffeehouse from time to time, but Mother kept me busy when he approached. He wasn't suitable, she said. Had no future, was a scamp, possibly even a scoundrel.  
  
  Last New Year's Day, Nathaniel had rubbed snow in my face and chased me across the ice. I pushed him into a snowbank, and Mother sent me home in disgrace. The following week, he took me to watch Blanchard's balloon fly away. He thought it would be marvelous to visit Paris.  
  
  Nathaniel Benson.  
  
  I cleared my throat.  
  
  jo  
  
  ""Good afternoon, Nathaniel. Kindly return my basket.""  
  
  ""Is that all you have to say? You disappoint me. I thought you would send me sailing into the horse trough at least. I guess you respect my new position as a man of the world.""  
  
  ""You are not a man of the world, you clean paintbrushes, though for the life of me I don't know why Mr. Peak bothers with you. And you will end up in that trough if you don't give back my basket."" I paused. ""Your shoe buckle is missing.""  
  
  ""What?""  
  
  I grabbed the basket as he looked down to inspect his shoe.  
  
  ""Very funny,"" he said.  
  
  ""Why are you here?"" I asked. ""Shouldn't you be working?""  
  
  He snatched an apple from my basket and took a bite. The impudence.  
  
  ""Master Peak gave me the day off. He has a committee meeting with the mayor and a visit with a banker. I ruin so much when he's present, he's afraid to let me work unsupervised. The day is mine, so I'm going fishing. Want to come?""  
  
  Fishing. I hadn't been fishing in months. And I'd known Nathaniel since I was a baby, so I could roll my sleeves up above my elbows in his presence. As long as Mother didn't see me do it.

I’m hoping to meet some new people locally and make a few friends to hang out with. A bit about me:

* I enjoy going for walks — coastal paths are my favourite, but I like wandering around local parks too.
* I cycle now and then, nothing too serious, just casual rides.
* I’ve been on a bit of a health kick recently, so I’ve been cooking more and trying to stay active.
* I enjoy reading and aimless wandering around Liverpool, finding new spots.
* I’m into gaming — mainly PC and Switch, and I play a lot of WoW.

I’d be up for a mix of things: grabbing a coffee or a pint, going for a walk, exploring Liverpool, or even just hopping on for some gaming together.

I’m hoping to meet some new people locally and make a few friends to hang out with. A bit about me:

* I enjoy going for walks — coastal paths are my favourite, but I like wandering around local parks too.
* I cycle now and then, nothing too serious, just casual rides.
* I’ve been on a bit of a health kick recently, so I’ve been cooking more and trying to stay active.
* I enjoy reading and aimless wandering around Liverpool, finding new spots.
* I’m into gaming — mainly PC and Switch, and I play a lot of WoW.

I’d be up for a mix of things: grabbing a coffee or a pint, going for a walk, exploring Liverpool, or even just hopping on for some gaming together.

1msyl9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1msyl9j/the_mystery_switch/,The Mystery Switch,"It’s been about seven months since I signed my year long lease for this shithole apartment. I don’t think I’ll be making it another five months. I’m not sure if I’ll even make it another night. My cheapness might’ve cost me my life. 

I was going to make this a short cry for help before I remembered that no one would ever believe me and it would be too late anyway. Hell, I wouldn’t believe this if I stumbled across it. I’ll just take my time here and pour my heart out. 

Seven months ago, I made what I now realise was the worst decision of my life. I moved into this dumpy ass apartment building after finally making the move out of my hometown. I had romanticized the idea of escapism so much. I pictured myself in New York City or something like that, walking down the sidewalk with some overpriced coffee in my hands and my tasteful messenger bag slung around my shoulder. I’d be walking to somewhere idyllic, maybe a get-together with new friends that took an interest in me or something like that - I never made it too far into that daydream. I just wanted to get out of that little rural town. It was one of those towns that was just a road with a bunch of sad old signs along it. Blown out buildings with occasional passing silhouettes that were once somebodies.

Let’s just say I couldn’t afford New York City, but I could afford a small city a few hours from that rotting place of a town. It’s a city with some high rises and skyscrapers but nothing that’s going to put it on somebody's road trip. It’s a pretty lonely place, honestly. It’s old and tired like my hometown, but in a more industrial way. Walkability isn’t much of a reality here unless you want to take your chances with the harsh weather or the rampant mugging - so there went my sidewalk daydream.

Still, I wanted to make the most of the experience. I got an apartment right downtown for a reasonable price and figured life would improve from there on. However, I failed to truly grasp how much of a piece of shit the apartment was until I moved in. I was a little too naive at the time to understand the spectrum of stress caused by a “landlord special”. The door knobs would come right off, the fridge never fully shut, the toilet wouldn’t flush without some sacred jiggling sequence, and a whole mess of other inconveniences or hazards. 

This apartment also has a lot of strange features. The floor plan doesn’t make much sense and anyone with a shred of interior design knowledge or even just self respect would’ve immediately crossed this place off their list. I was so desperate though that I didn’t mind when I entered the apartment and just saw a hallway full of closed doors. I shrugged off how strange it was that each room was contained behind one of those doors, with none of the rooms connecting to one another. The kitchen is its own closed off room, the living room too - the only way to get anywhere in the apartment was to take the central hallway. It honestly looks like one of those hallway chase shots in Scooby Doo or some shit.

For how awful the place is, it’s not small. There are a good amount of rooms, and I actually hadn’t  been able to fill one particular room until recently.

When you walk into the place, there’s the long hallway and then nine doors total. There’s four on the left side, four on the right, and one at the very end of the hallway. On the right side, the doors in order are the living room, a closet, then my bedroom, and then the bathroom. On the left side it starts with the kitchen, then another closet, the dining room, and a second bedroom. The ninth door in the middle is that extra room. I barely had enough stuff just to fill the other rooms and I lacked any sort of motivation to do anything with the extra room for a while. I have a corner unit so all the rooms on the right side of the apartment have windows as well as the extra room. The extra room has these neat casement windows that I like to look out of but offer little privacy. I had thought to make the extra room a sort of reading area or a home theater type deal but I was flat broke.

The extra room is strange. It’s really big and open. It feels like an apartment of its own. One night, I was in there just looking out at the other surrounding high rises when I noticed a light switch that had been painted over right next to the window. I didn’t think much of it. It was clearly just another amenity of my shithole apartment. I left it alone.

As time went on, I found myself in that extra room most nights just looking out the window. I didn’t have the money for any fancy streaming services nor friends to leech off of - so I just looked out that window most nights. It was peaceful and at night the city looked bigger and more lively. I loved seeing all the different lights, the blurry shapes of people in their own world watching their TV or making dinner. It didn’t take long for me to start picking at the paint on that hidden light switch as I watched the world wind down every night.

I’d chip away at the paint little by little with my finger while I was lost in my thoughts. It took a few days to make any sort of progress, but eventually I had peeled off enough paint to see the light switch. It was a different color than the new plain white paint that covered everything else. It was bronze and the switch itself was almost antique looking. It got me wondering how old this building was.

A few nights later the old switch was finally uncovered. It caught the light in an intoxicating way and I flipped the switch on and off a few times to see if it still worked and what it controlled. Nothing changed. 

The next night brought a heavy snowstorm. It was beautiful and you already know I was set up at that window staring out at the world as the brilliant snow fell. At some point, I was reminded of the bronze light switch and I flicked it, not remembering if I’d already tried it the night before. Nothing changed. I absentmindedly flicked it again and noticed something strange out of the corner of my eye. A light turned on in the building across the street. 

It was the rightmost room on the top floor of the neighboring high rise which was quite a bit taller than my building. At first, I just thought it was something new to look at. My hand still on the switch, I craned my neck up and leaned in to watch the new light. I lost concentration and flicked the switch down and the room’s light turned off. That caught my attention. I looked down at the switch and back up at the now dark pane of glass. I flipped the switch up and at that exact moment the room’s light turned back on. 

I continued doing this for probably five minutes - just flipping the switch on and off and watching as the faraway room’s light perfectly matched. The snow began falling even more, but I could still make out the light turning off and on with every flick of the old switch. I was baffled before too long. So baffled that I went right to sleep, convinced I was deprived of logic and reasoning.

The next night came and, at first, I was definitely reluctant to mess with that switch or to even go in that room. I tried staring out other windows but they were cloudy with trapped moisture. I remember thinking I should get a cat or something before I finally caved and walked into the extra room.

There was traffic on the street below from some accident that night and it provided me with enough entertainment to remain distracted from what happened the night before. The standstill row of gray cars could only stimulate me for so long before I was looking at that switch again. 

I flipped it.

Such a harmless action, and so quick too. Flipping a light switch. Usually done by second nature. What’s the harm in it? Why did flipping that switch feel so important? 

The same room from the night before lit up. It was a yellow, more vintage looking tone of light. I tried using some beaten up binoculars from my childhood but all I got was a somehow-fuzzier view of the room. From my vantage, I could only really see the ceiling of that mysterious place.

*That’s gotta be an apartment, right? It looks too big to be a storage closet. Too small to be anything commercial.*

I flipped the switch again and the light turned off in perfect succession.

*Is somebody fucking with me?*

Flip. The light came back on.

*How would they even orchestrate that?*

I sat there for a long time, repeatedly flipping the switch on and off as if the repetition of this would bring more clarity. I stood there flipping that switch on and off like I was a geriatric old man smacking a television set, hoping for a signal.

The traffic jam cleared out and the streets became empty. I sat there, still as I could be, periodically flipping the switch on and off. The light synced every single time. 

Clearly this light switch - for some reason - was wired to that room in the building across the street. As to why, I had no earthly idea.

*What an expensive project, and for what? What purpose does it serve?*

I flipped the switch up and the light came back on. That last flip of the switch activated a - sorry - lightbulb moment within me. 

*What if I found a way into that room?* 

So I waited in the bitter cold, rehearsing my moves. I had counted up from the ground and determined the room which connected to my light switch was on the 31st floor and again it was the corner unit on the right side of the building when viewing from my apartment.

I waited for someone to go in or out of the building. Finally, I saw a woman with a giant coat drag her scrappy little dog towards the door. I was hesitant to actually go inside, but then I gathered some courage, walked right up to that door and casually slid through as she opened it. I had planned some elaborate cover story that my friend wouldn’t answer his phone and all that, but when it came time, I just acted natural and thanked her as I entered.

The halls were green and sickly looking, much like my apartment building. The elevator was questionable at best and creaked a little too much as I stepped into it. There were 33 floors so I was glad I had made note of the correct one. I slowly reached up and hit the circular button for the 31st floor and it flickered on, glowing with a jaundiced yellow.

My hands grew clammy as the elevator ascended at a torturously slow pace. I watched the numbers rise…

11… 12… 13…

*This is a stupid idea, man.*

*This is all in my head.*

*Why am I doing this?*

26… 27… 28…

*Is this even legal?*

*What am I going to do, exactly?*

The elevator finally dinged and bounced to a stop on the 31st floor before I had an actual plan. The doors were reluctant to open, and for a moment, my heart sank thinking I had been trapped in there. 

Those silver doors creaked and warped as they moved out of the way and exposed me to another green hallway. I stepped out and turned left. I could see all the way down the long dilapidated hall, the green lights humming and buzzing. My alleged culprit was the final door on the right.

It was room 3118. I sat outside the door like a maniac, just looking at it. I wondered what to do. I could barely see through the slits on the sides of the door, all I could make out was that the lights were on in there. 

*Do I knock?*

I looked around me and made sure the coast was clear.

*What the hell do I say? Maybe I’m lost? Maybe it’s an honest mistake? If anyone lives in there, I’m sure they’re very confused about their lights turning on and off. But why wouldn’t they take control of their own lights? Maybe they can’t use them - but that doesn’t make any sense. Why would I be able to control their lights but they ca-*

I knocked on the door and startled myself. It felt almost automatic.

Unsure of what to do, I started to shuffle away and make my retreat. Then I decided to stay and wait. I waited for a few seconds. The pause was long and uncomfortable enough for my hand to instinctually rise for another round of knocking. 

A faint and vague sound, dampened enough to even be of my own mind. But it was the sound of dragging, or a thud of some kind with something rolling afterward.

*What was that?*

The sound might’ve continued, or my mind might’ve kept wandering.

*Maybe the neighbors?*

The walls were thin in this place. I could begin to hear indiscernible conversation somewhere down the hall. I could hear the hissing chatter of a TV show somewhere else.

Underneath all that though, in room 3118 - a rolling sound still. Maybe?

*What is that noise?*

I left not long after. I was getting freaked out and I’m sure I would’ve freaked out anyone living there.

When I got back to my place across the street, I felt very paranoid. I felt like I was being watched. I opened the squeaky door to my apartment and the long dark hallway of nine closed doors now made me nauseous with dread. I wanted to leave that apartment behind and run back into my mom’s arms or something - I felt like a child. 

I walked in, though. And I wish I hadn’t.

I took a scorching hot shower. It made me feel a little better, but I was still so paranoid. I kept hearing, or thought I was hearing, similar thudding and rolling sounds in one of the other rooms.

*Old pipes, that’s all.*

It took some more courage to leave the bathroom and enter the cold dark hall. I didn’t know what door to go through next - the kitchen door, bedroom door, or the extra door. My stomach was in a knot but I thought I should probably try and eat something.

It was around midnight by that point and I felt hopeless knowing there were so many more hours of dark left. I looked down at my half eaten peanut butter sandwich and knew this knot in my stomach wouldn’t go away if I didn’t have some kind of closure. I wanted to go into the extra room and turn off that switch for the night.

I braved the silent hallway again and opened up the ninth door into that grand room that turned the faintest sound into a booming echo. I walked up to the big window I always looked out of and, with great caution, looked up at room 3118. 

The light was still on - and there was something up there now.

I couldn’t tell what it was, but it looked like a big shadow. It wasn’t a person, but something boxy looking. Something square or just rigid, really.

*Furniture?*

*Did someone move something around in there?*

I didn’t know what I was looking at, and I honestly didn’t have the mental space to think about it much longer. I flipped off the light.

I flipped it back on.

I couldn’t deny my interest. I was very invested in this whole ordeal now.

The rigid thing started moving, at least I thought it looked like it was slowly changing position. It moved very smoothly and very, very slow. It looked like it was rolling or sliding.

It rolled from the right side of the window to the left. I flipped the switch here and there to see if it made any sort of difference. It didn’t seem to.

I watched it roll along for a few minutes from right to left until I jumped at the sight of the neighboring window’s light turning on. It was whoever lived in room 3116. I saw a person moving around in there and it looked like a more elderly man. He looked like he was listening closely to something, as if there were an intruder in his house.

I didn’t know what to do, but now I felt intrusive watching this man fumble around. I decided to switch the light off in 3118 and try to forget about the whole thing. I wanted to remove myself from this weird nightmare entirely. I decided that the next day I’d try to disconnect the switch and install some curtains. Find a new hobby. That all sounded like something rooted in everyday monotony and I let the comfort of curtain shopping lull me to sleep.

In my sleep that night, I heard the sound of aggressive wind chimes far away. They weren’t very melodic wind chimes, sort of just one tone that reverberated. Then I heard an awful banging sound. It was loud and most definitely not a dream. It sounded distant but it contained a lot of power. It was 3:48AM.

I tossed and I turned some until my bedroom started flashing red. I got out of bed and tried to see what was happening outside from my bedroom window but I couldn’t see through all the gloom trapped in between the glass. I had no choice but to go into the extra room if I wanted to see outside.

There was a large fire truck that was blocking off one side of the road and police were putting up caution tape on the other. Squad cars were rolling in one after the other. A few ambulances were present too but it seemed like no one was in a big rush. They were all circled around, their hands waving about in a casual, conversational way. At some point, one of them looked up and pointed and the others followed along. I followed the trajectory of the gestures all the way to the 31st floor. Room 3116 was now missing its pane of glass.

The curtains whipped out into the open world. The lights were still on and I could make out vague details of the interior.

Back on the ground, a few paramedics moved out of the way long enough for me to see what I was already preparing to see. The old man from room 3116 was laying there in a confusing mess of fabric, flesh, and bones surrounded by a growing puddle of blood. I was shocked.

*What the hell is going on?*

*What did I do?*

*Am I losing my mind?*

*Did I inadvertently kill that man?*

The next few days were a blur. My head was heavy with the endless hum of a thousand different thoughts all saying similar things. I felt an immense weight of guilt even though there was nothing tangible that connected me to the old man’s plunge. In my head, there was an ever growing web of continuity.

I uncovered the old switch, I flipped it incessantly and - in doing that - I created or resumed… something. That something looked like a giant fucking rectangle that rolled around and made a man jump to his death. Or maybe it pushed him out by force?

*But… why?*

*None of this makes any sense.*

*Maybe it’s all just make believe. I could’ve misunderstood what I saw - the rolling rectangle thing - maybe it was just an illusion. That old man, maybe it’s just a coincidence he chose tonight to leap.*

*I know what I saw…*

I no longer was going into the extra room for any reason. The thought of that big empty space with that damn switch made me nauseous. I couldn’t stand sleeping just a few doors away from it. I wanted to move out and get away. I should’ve done that. Reality doesn’t make room for fiction, though. I couldn’t and still can’t afford to break my lease, not by a long shot. That’s three rent payments and a bundle of paperwork in this godforsaken building. The apartment’s obviously outdated so I thought about making a case for lead paint or something toxic that could maybe get me out of here for free and quick but I’m not sure how that’d blow over. I don’t even know how to go about doing something like that.

I chose the route of avoidance. If I could ignore the extra room, the mystery switch, the dead man’s browning blood stain on the road, and the rolling rectangle monster whose whereabouts weren’t known - maybe it’d all just fade away with time. 

A few weeks went by and that strategy was seeming to work. Even in that short time, I was afforded some hindsight of the whole event - how I was jumping to conclusions, being paranoid, and maybe not appreciating my deteriorating vision that was probably making some serious guesswork. 

Still, there was no explaining away the light switch. That switch is undoubtedly connected to room 3118 across the street for some unknown reason. I must’ve tested it hundreds of times. I tried to not let that fact dig too deep when I couldn’t sleep or when I’d think I heard the rolling sounds across the apartment late at night.

Eventually, I had saved up enough money to treat myself with some more furniture. I wanted to reclaim the extra room and make it mine. I started with a thrifted recliner and some shelves. I was planning on making it a home theater after all. I had plans to bury the big casement windows behind blackout curtains.

Earlier tonight, I was moving some new finds into the home theater. The room’s echo was just as booming and awful as when it was empty and I flinched with every screech and scrape the furniture would make when I moved it. As I heaved the new TV stand around, my eyes subconsciously checked on room 3118 - a reflex that must’ve been built into me after all those cold nights. The lights were off as I had left them the last time I flipped the switch.

The lights were on in room 3116.

*Don’t… don’t freak out.* 

*Maybe someone new moved in.*

I watched longer than I should’ve. I don’t know why I’m so nosey. Always trying to get to the bottom of everything.

I watched and waited for any sign of movement in room 3116. I never saw a soul in there.

At some point, the big coat lady came out of the building with her dog and, for some stupid reason, I felt compelled to go talk to her.

*I just need to be sure of something.*

I walked casually down the sidewalk, waiting to “run” into her again. I was going to ask her if she had a lighter and then I was going to ask her if she had any information on room 3116.

Eventually, she reappeared around the corner with her feisty little dog walking on its hind legs, strangling itself with the leash.

I was leaned up on the wall next to the door I had snuck in weeks before, waiting to say my line.

“Excuse me,” I said. “Do you have a light?”

She looked up with confusion. 

“Like a flashlight?” she asked.

I flashed my carton of cigarettes.

“Oh, no honey - I’ve got asthma, sorry.”

“No problem,” I muttered back.

I tried to come up with anything else I could say so I could eventually segue into room 3116. Blanking, I simply stared ahead in disappointment. That’s when I noticed the faded bloodstain on the sidewalk from the old man. I clicked my tongue.

“Terrible what happened,” I muttered. 

The big coat lady turned around and saw what I was staring at, understanding immediately.

“Ugh, I know. I’m up on the 13th floor and I heard the uh - the sound.” She was slowly nodding and now staring at the old puddle of blood herself.

“I heard someone talking about how they already moved a new family into that unit he was in, is that right?” I asked, surprising myself.

“Oh, no. I think they’re letting it sit like they did with the last one,” she said. 

My brow raised. I tried to not act like an insane person and scare her off. 

“The last one?” I asked hesitantly.

“Yeah, it was just a few months ago - or maybe it was a year now - but the young couple that lived right next door to him jumped out the window too,” she said in a flat way.

I could’ve fainted. I felt dizzy and clammy, but I tried to keep my calm demeanor.

“That is, wow, I’m pretty new to the building so I hadn’t heard,” I stammered. I resigned from my niceties and my eyes went out of focus as my mind began jumping to its newest conclusion.

Somewhere in my peripheral, I noticed the lady nodding and looking down at her scraggly dog.

“Well, it sure is hard out here these days,” she said, breaking the silence.

She shuffled through the heavy apartment door which slammed behind her, startling me. Torn from my trance, I quickly retreated back to my apartment.

*Shit… shit!*

*What does this mean? That it - that rolling square thing - lives in that room and… what? Kills people in it and around it? Do the people kill themselves? Does the thing maybe inject them with something that makes them, I don’t know, suicidal? Or maybe they go crazy and just jump?*

I was thinking like a fucking lunatic. Like one of the cracked out vagrants wandering through the abandoned motels back in my hometown. I tried to slow myself down, but now I’d been given perfect evidence to suit my paranoid suspicions. At first, I was just trying to solve this complex series of events, then I remembered I was involved. I remembered the switch plays a role in this whole thing. The light switch in my home theater.

*How far can it move?*

*How far…*

*Could it cross the street and climb the stairs and break in?*

*Maybe it’s quiet or maybe it has some kind of way to silently open my door so I don’t notice. So the neighbors don’t notice…*

I found myself back in the home theater with some cheap whiskey in a plastic bottle. I sipped on it and enjoyed the aromatic sting that made me slowly feel braver with every gulp. I looked up at the 31st floor across the street. The lights were still on in room 3116.

*They’re probably just cleaning it out. You need to calm yourself.*

*None of this is your problem.*

I felt better and braver still with every new swig of the cruel whiskey. At some point, I hovered my hand over the light switch. The dwindling sobriety in me said no. The courageous drunken me said *I’m just curious*. My sight was beginning to sharpen and blur and I could tell I was swaying as I stood in front of those windows. I was drunk enough to where I felt like an observer of a faded memory from the past. I was drunk enough to where any action felt insignificant and all would be fine because nothing mattered. 

I flipped the switch, expecting the lights of room 3118 to blink on. The lights in room 3116 turned off instead.

*Shit!*

I don’t know why, but seeing those lights turn off made me duck and hide below the window. I felt like I woke the rolling thing up and now it could see me.

*Shit!*

*It moved. It fucking moved.*

Logic and reasoning was now out the window. The lights magically switched rooms and I can only imagine it’s because the square rolling thing now occupied - or will now materialize - inside of room 3116.

I continued hiding and thinking horrible thoughts to myself. I then did something I would’ve never done had I not been wasted. I grabbed a hammer and smashed that fucking light switch. I smashed it into a million pieces and then smashed those pieces into dust. I’m sure my neighbors were fuming but I had been quiet as a church mouse up until tonight.

Both room 3118 and 3116 now had no lights on and I had made the drunken assumption that now they were both safe. This all began when I turned the lights on in 3118. Now the lights would stay off forever and I made sure of it. Clearly I didn’t have the self control to stop myself from tinkering with this unknown thing. I doubt anyone else who would live here would have much more discipline. So I smashed the fucking switch into a million pieces.

It wasn’t long before I blacked out.

Something woke me up hours later. It was deep into the night. I was still in the home theater and still drunk but now also hungover. I tried to pull it together enough to figure out what woke me.

I had thought it was a loud sound, but maybe it wasn’t. The air felt like something loud had just occurred, but that was just a feeling - maybe one of paranoia. I looked out the window and half-expected to see another person or persons lying smashed on the ground after diving off the 31st floor, but I saw no such horror. Both 3118 and 3116’s lights were still off.

I rubbed my eyes and looked around the pitch black room. I felt my blood freeze.

There was a light on in my apartment. I could see the thin sliver of yellow illuminating underneath the door of the home theater.

*It’s in.*

I wanted to run at first, but then I wanted to sit still and just listen. So I sat there, waiting for something. Maybe it was waiting for me to make a move.

Then I heard it. Muffled, maybe in the kitchen - rolling. Finally, I could hear the sound in finer detail. The wheels sounded heavy, like the sound of a stone tomb opening. The cheap hardwood floor buckled and cracked underneath those giant rolling wheels which must’ve moved extremely slow and calculated - as if it was listening for my heartbeat.

I was frozen with fear and confused, so confused.

*What kind of nightmare has my life become?*

I wanted to try and make a break for it. I thought about running as fast as I could down my awful

hallway and ripping that front door open. It was only a few quick strides away. I sat up a little too quickly, adrenaline was kicking in. A spring in the shitty secondhand recliner I had passed out on popped causing an insignificant yet audible click throughout the house.

Rolling followed. It was very slow, so slow that one’s ear could lose the deep droning tone after long enough to background noise.

I slowly sat back and the recliner crinkled ever so softly. The thing made a noise so intentionally imperceptible I could hardly make it out. A metallic sliding sound. The sound of a door’s latch being methodically opened. It was leaving the kitchen and maybe it was moving onto one of the other doors now. 

The yellow sliver of light went out and the apartment was now totally dark.

Rolling persisted and I was barely able to perceive the noise. I spent the next few minutes sliding off my recliner with the precision of prey which I undoubtedly had become. Thirty minutes could’ve passed before I had crawled close enough to see under the door’s crack.

I carefully positioned my left eye to where I could see out into the black hallway just enough.

Something impossibly dark. Darker than the natural blackness of night. It was just sitting in the hall - waiting. It was large and boxy, just like that silhouette in 3118. It looked to almost perfectly fit the dimensions of the hall, leaving me sealed in.

*I’m dead.*

*Maybe not. Maybe I can call the police or something and distract it.*

*It’d kill them, though. Right? Then I’d be a murderer, maybe? Or maybe it would roll away. Maybe it isn’t bulletproof.* 

*I can’t have anyone else’s blood on my hands.*

*Maybe I can start a fire somehow and then the fire department will be able to rescue me from the window? Maybe that’s the stupidest thought I’ve ever had.*

*Too much noise. I can’t make any noise. I can’t make a sound or it’ll come get me.*

My thoughts were so frantic and visceral I feared even they would make a sound which could be intercepted by the masterful listener sitting mere feet away.

Another thirty minutes of eternity and I had silently made my way towards the large windows. I was so cautious and so deliberate in my movements as to not touch the tiniest plastic shard on the ground from when I had drunkenly destroyed the light switch.

*Maybe I made it angry by doing that. Maybe, in breaking the switch, the thing reverted back to me? Or maybe I exposed myself to it when I smashed that switch.*

I tried to use my phone and call for help, text for help, fucking email for help. None of it was going through. That damn rolling demon must’ve jammed my signal somehow. I ran out of hope. I froze in place. Eventually, I just started to write all of this. 

I’m still in the home theater, typing all of this out on my phone as quietly as I can, even sipping the last of my whiskey with the most delicate swigs one could imagine.

This whole thing is rather bleak, and I apologize if you stumble across this. I’ve scheduled this post to go up in eight hours, maybe by then the thing will have left and my final words will get out into the world to be forgotten or laughed at. I’m sure you think I’m insane or maybe I’m just a liar - and that’s okay - I know what happened here tonight. I don’t know how or why any of this happened, but I know the rolling thing outside my door is real. 

I don’t know why it’s here, what its motivation is, if it’s manmade or some impersonation of something we’d engineer or maybe it’s the very muse of humanity’s chase for right angles and industrial design. I now understand how those people in room 3118 and 3116 met their fate on the cracked pavement below. I think it wants me to kill myself. Either that or it’s totally content with me killing myself. It’s had me trapped in this room for hours now. It could’ve barged in and flattened me at any point, but it hasn’t yet. Funny how this all started in this damn extra room of mine. Funny how these windows are the ideal design and size for me to throw myself from this hellish place. 

I don’t know anymore. At t this point I’m just trying to buy time and sip more whiskey before the inevitable. I had been distracted in writing this for a few hours and and even began to have hope that when the sun came up, the thing would roll away. All I’d need is a few minutes to get out.

I don’t think I’m so lucky though. The sky is beginning to brighten into a deep blue and onc again I hear that steadDy rolling. so slow and meticulous, itt must only be moving a centimeter every fifteen minutes.

The whisky is is doing job and it’s becoming hard to type, harder to maintain literacy. I thikn I;ll wrap this up here. I’m sorry eveyone. I can only hope this is seen and if you did see this i thank you for keeping me company, in a Way. the suns almost up. I hear rolling and its close. The view from the window is very nice. Its looking like a nice day. I hope it iis a nice day,",2,1755455379.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

We like to get small bags to try different coffees although dialing each can be tricky (some easier than others). To clarify we finish one bag st the time but have the others ready/degassing

Our approach has been buying from nearby local roasters and also have a couple of subscriptions (once a month delivery). One from a favorite coffee and one from Trade

Any tips on how to manage? Sometimes we have to buy last minute coffee because we run out or sometimes we have a few too many bags. Add to this that sometimes we have visits and consume more + also we consume 1 decaf bag 10 oz every two weeks 

Luckily we have a phone notes with details on each and sometimes go back to favorites so dialing is easier

TLDR we want to have beans off diferent roast dates (fresh to 28 days) ready without having too many subscriptions

1msygte,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalScience/comments/1msygte/my_advice_to_students_and_recent_grads_for/,My advice to students and recent grads for success in political science jobs.,"For political science students– I see a lot of posts asking about what jobs you can get, what you should do, how to stand out. I wanted to make a post about what helped me. I graduated with my degree in 2018 and have been working in the field for over ten years now. These are the best tips I can give you.



1. Start interning during your freshman summer. Yes, your degree IS going to be useless if all you come out with at the end is just the degree. Your resume should be lined and padded as much as possible showing you are determined and working in the field immediately. Even if they are part time 5/hr a week unpaid internships or volunteering work, do it-- a lot of big names in the field offer these things. Go to city council meetings. Phonebank for a candidate. Volunteer with political action committees and issue advocacy organizations. 



2. Reverse engineer your career. Job postings are roadmaps for you. Start going on LinkedIn, [Hiring.Cafe](http://Hiring.Cafe), or whatever job site of your choice. Do job searches for ""political science"" ""politics"" ""policy"" ""government""; or ""policy analyst"" ""legislative"" ""government affairs"" or ""political research"" ""legal research"" “lobbyist” “campaign” “field organizer” and look at the roles that are posted. Look at the qualifications required of each job. See one you like or would be interested in when you graduate? Start doing everything you can to get the skills and qualifications you see being asked for in the job postings. 

Also, connect with people on LinkedIn that are in political science– journalists, nonprofit leaders, policy and thinktank veterans. Read what they're saying, follow the people they follow. If there is one in your town, ask if they'd be up for grabbing coffee and chatting with someone who wants a career like theirs. After 4+ years of following and interacting with these people, you will have some connections and name recognition. Stay in contact with everyone from the companies you interned or worked at– they can help you get roles in the future.



3. Make a Google Doc with a list of jobs, companies, and roles you are interested in. Keep it up. When you graduate, you have a big list of companies you're already interested in and if you followed step #2, you've already built your skills to match them. Keep another doc with all of the successes and projects you can discuss in future interviews or add to resumes. 



4. Participate in political science clubs at your college. Go to your professors office hours and ask them about things youre interested in, job paths, just become close with them. Start a Medium account or whatever and start writing or investigating topics you're interested in. Build up your writing and research skills by reading publications being written by people in jobs you want. You want to work at a public policy ThinkTank/Nonprofit contributing to policy analysis articles? Go read the publications that that organization is publishing. Absorb the way they write. The things they say, the data they look at. Try to emulate it. Do not rely on ChatGPT for writing. Young people are losing their writing and critical thinking skills and it’s obvious to me when interviewing recent grads.



5. Pick a policy topic, or several, that you are interested in, and start following it in the news. Want to work on abortion and reproductive health care projects? That is a huge, well funded, large policy space with lots of nonprofit, PAC, and campaign jobs in that space. Start following developments on that topic in the news and read up on the history of it. Same idea goes for environmental topics, redistricting, transportation, etc. Skills that go well with political science related jobs include data-- learning SQL, relational databases will help as companies deal with a lot of data and you will too in many jobs. Same with social media and communications as these roles include social media and comms roles. Research -- go into your state's legislative website and start learning how to search for bills, read legislation, understand how lawmaking happens and what goes into it. Poke around the state campaign finance database, read the PAC reports-- also a good way to find companies and businesses and organizations that are donating to political causes, then you can go to that company's website and perhaps they are hiring for political roles. Read the news, watch the news. 



6. Have a back up. If you build up social media and comms, you can go for those jobs even if they’re not political science related. You can go for a paralegal certificate afterwards or concurrently so you will be immediately qualified for legal assistant and entry level paralegal roles. 



7. Get very comfortable with public speaking, resume writing, networking. 



I’m sure I forgot some. Feel free to ask questions.

1msygp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1msygp5/uncover_if_blackdecker_12_cup_thermal_coffee/,Uncover if BLACK+DECKER 12 Cup Thermal Coffee Maker CM2046S is worth it in this review!,"**A Stylish and Functional Coffee Maker with Customization Options**  

The BLACK+DECKER CM2046S 12-Cup Thermal Programmable Coffee Maker has been my constant companion these past few weeks, and I’ve put it through the wringer to see if it lives up to the hype. At first glance, the minimalist black and steel design caught my attention. The sleek look ensures it blends seamlessly into any kitchen, and with its compact dimensions—9"" x 9.4"" x 13.2""—it easily fits on my cluttered counter without taking up too much precious space. A bonus for anyone who lives in apartments with limited kitchen real estate! The programmable feature was a lifeline during hectic mornings and lazy weekends.  

**Ease of Use and Overall Functionality**  

One of the key features of this coffee maker is its user-friendly programmable brewing system. It didn’t take me long to set up a routine where I’d wake up every morning to the smell of freshly brewed coffee. Utilizing the 24-hour auto-brew feature was simple. A few button presses on the easy-to-read digital display, and it became an automated part of my day. Even on my busiest mornings, I didn’t have to worry about rushing to make a cup manually. Aside from automation, I appreciated how the ""strong brew"" option produced bold and flavorful coffee for my long workdays.  

[Check BLACK+DECKER CM2046S price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c2jk9y8v/)  

**Vortex Technology for Enhanced Flavor Extraction**  

If there’s something that truly sets this coffee maker apart, it's the Vortex Technology. Using an exclusive showerhead design, the system saturates the coffee grounds evenly, ensuring every drop of water passes through for robust, rich flavors. During my tests, I experimented with both regular and dark roast grounds. The difference in flavor was striking compared to my old drip coffee machine that often left coffee tasting flat.  

**Advantages**  

- The four-layer vacuum-sealed thermal carafe kept my coffee hot for up to two hours, as promised. It stayed warm during late mornings when my to-do list delayed my coffee break.  
- No-drip perfect pour spout ensures no spills, even if you're someone as clumsy as me.  
- The reusable filter saves money and reduces waste—no more endless purchases of paper filters!  
- It runs quietly, even while brewing, making it an attractive option for early risers who don’t want to disturb the household.  

**Disadvantages**  

- The thermal carafe doesn’t have a see-through panel, so I sometimes found myself unsure of how much coffee was left during gatherings.  
- Though a programmable feature is handy, navigating the UI’s initial setup might feel slightly overwhelming for less tech-savvy users.  
- The strong-brew setting slows the brewing process a bit, which might bother some in need of a quicker caffeine kick.  

**Alternative Offerings**  

Diving into competitors, there are plenty of capable alternatives. For example, the Cuisinart DCC-3200 is another 12-cup programmable option that offers a similar strong brew function and extended heat retention. However, it lacks the thermal carafe's vacuum-sealed design, instead relying on a warming plate—something that often leads to burnt coffee taste over time. On the higher end, Breville’s Precision Brewer offers brew customization, but that one feels suited for hardcore coffee aficionados with larger budgets. In contrast, the BLACK+DECKER CM2046S strikes a satisfying balance between customizability, affordability, and everyday functionality, making it an excellent choice for beginners or seasoned drinkers seeking an upgrade.  

**Smart Spending**  

The price-to-value ratio of this coffee maker comes out strong compared to others in its category. With features like programmable settings, advanced flavor extraction, and excellent thermal carafe design, the investment feels worthwhile for anyone hesitant to splurge on premium espresso machines but still wanting a better brewing experience. Its reusable filter adds to cost efficiency by eliminating the need to purchase disposables repeatedly. Considering how often I use it, I’d say the cost feels justified for its practicality and long-term savings.

This is dedicated to the humans who believe, like I do, that Twin Peaks season 3 aka the Return is one of the early masterworks of the 21st century.

Its the Post Relevant Podcast's triumphant trip back through the Lion's Gate once more again, but this time, with bees! Strap on your mesh spacesuit and try not to get stung (by the insight) as hosts Phil Ristaino and Justin Epifanio descend back into decoding Twin Peaks: the Return (episode 5). Ride the wheels within wheels within wheels across six-sided hives echoing through time while we follow Mr Strawberry on a tour over haunted cities, sweet rides and/or exploding cars, messy desks, textured lips, pink triplets, and the most delicious green tea latte you've ever been forced to drink by default. And who are you in this story? A young kid in his pajamas, pawing at that glowing switch underneath the neighbor's car? A zombied-out insurance agent who's obsessed with coffee and forgotten he's the main character of the story?  A methd-out, poorly mustachioed mumbler? A lovely, disinterested casino wallflower? A demon-possessed wizard criminal who sets off all alarms ever? Are you....Mr Strawberry? On second thought, don't tell me....

My name is Phil. I have a show called the Post Relevant Podcast. Season 3 of the PRP is currently doing a scene by scene, often line by line decode of Twin Peaks: the Return. My co-host Justin and I are both in the film biz, and we chose to comb through each episode of this masterwork in the hopes to unwind Lynch and Frost's mysterious surrealist narrative. We try to come at it from every angle we can think of, observing film techniques, color choices, symbolism, esotericism, myth, dialogue, acting, the greater TP narrative, golden shovels (2 coats!) - the whole shebang.

Plus! The show is scored with the amazing music of the electronic ear candy project Polypores! Also! Lots of little stories, comedy jokes, sound effects, and moments of easy-going chaos are peppered throughout the ep. And I spend time on my own observing magical synchronicities and time loops I've been experiencing since starting the decode of TP:TR - hopefully to good effect to yield more insight into the show.  And then!  We catch up with a guest from season one of the pod, who survived and hit and run and lived to tell the tale....(don't worry, it has a happy ending).

Its an ambitious show -- ideally, unlike anything you've ever heard before. I hope you will give it a try....

I had a friend from Rome join me who could do all the translating.  The first thing we learned the dialect they spoke made the job more than a little interesting.

The civil officer was expecting me and upon our arrival greeted us with a big 'Good Morning' in English.  Great I thought, English.  No those were the only two words he knew.

I was led to his office, shared with the local Carabinieri officer.  He proceeded to show me all of the transcriptions and had copies of all my documents in a folder for me to carry home.  This was a nice touch and unexpected.  He explained what it takes to do the records.  Got to see a couple of the ''Old'' registers of births and events from the mid 1800's.  

Seems transcribing divorces are a lot of work and time consuming.  It was explained the rule is one gets a new wife when the old one passes away.  They do not just keep trading in for a new one.  I was given a nickname due to being married more than once.  So I became the Playboy of Aliano.  I asked if that means I get a statue.  Everyone started laughing thought it was a good idea.

He also provided me with the names of a distant cousins who no longer lived in the village that I should contact.  He really went out of his way doing the research.

Seemed strange people kept coming in and out of the office for a pencil, paper clip etc.  Finally I was told they just wanted to say hi.  He noted I was the first person recognized that he knows of.  Plus my pending visit became the talk of the village.  

The visit continued when asked if it was time for a coffee at the bar right up the street.  No walking, the Carabinieri officer said get in I will drive.  After the coffee I got a tour of the village.   I was taken to the  ghost village where my grandfather and family once lived.  Alianello is the only hamlet in the municipality of Aliano.  It suffered heavy damage in the 1980 earthquake and all the residents were moved to a new area of town homes built by the government. 

The visited ended with lunch.  The restaurant was opened for us.  Insane they made lunch for 2 people I was there guest.  They would not accept any payment.   I took the amount I knew was correct and passed it along to the parish priest for flowers for the altar for sunday mass.  

The visit lasted 5 hours.  I figured we met at least 50 folks who kept saying to come back and visit.  The parish priest told me that he will make sure anytime I want to visit he will find me a place to stay for a night or two.  

Well I have been back several times, keep in touch with a number of folks and have attended several events.  I get email notices of festivals and events on a regular basis.  It is unfortunate that it is such a small village, about 900 people, and so remote.  The good thing is it is only a 6 hour drive from Rome.   It is a place that when we are there it really feels like home.",19,1755454981.0,juresanguinis,3,1.0,False

As someone who spends an unreasonable amount of time trying to keep my dog entertained, the Hartz 032700159078 Oinkies Chew Bones seemed like a promising choice. The bone-shaped design immediately caught my attention, as it makes it easy for dogs to grip at either end, perfect for my overly enthusiastic small breed pup who insists on holding everything himself. Unlike flat chews that end up sliding around on the floor, these are simple for dogs to hold while thoroughly chomping on them. The chicken flavor seems to drive my dog wild—his nose practically stuck to the bag the moment I opened it. Packaging claims aside, these bones really deliver when it comes to engaging dogs with both flavor and functionality.  

**Check [Hartz Oinkies Chew Bones 032700159078] price on Amazon.**  

**Ingredients and Digestibility**  
One of the highlights of this product is the rawhide-free composition. For years, I avoided rawhide treats due to their known digestive issues, so finding an alternative like this was a real win. Made with 100% real pig skin and wrapped in savory chicken breast meat, these chews provide a balance of chewiness and taste. My dog didn't seem to struggle at all with digesting them, and I wasn't left worrying about stomach upset later in the evening. It’s reassuring to know these bones are designed to be highly digestible, especially for dogs with guilty-pleasure tendencies to eat quickly. Just remember the packaging directions: supervision is a must when your dog is chewing.  

**Flavor and Appeal to Dogs**  
The twice-baked, naturally smoked flavoring on these chews is like a magnet for dogs. My neighbor’s slightly picky Chihuahua even went wild over them, so that’s saying something. The real chicken breast adds to the appeal—an upgrade from the generic artificial flavorings you find in some cheaper chews. Every time I open the resealable bag, my dog immediately perks up, tail wagging in pure excitement. The smell, while potent to a dog, isn’t completely overwhelming to humans, which is always appreciated when these things happen to linger on the coffee table for longer than expected.

**Durability and Longevity**  
Admittedly, my dog is a moderate chewer, not someone you'd classify as a destroyer of worlds when it comes to chew toys. These lasted him about 20–30 minutes per bone depending on his mood. Are they ""long-lasting""? That depends on your interpretation. A power chewer might plow through them quickly, but for many small and medium breeds, they provide more chew-time than a biscuit-type reward but certainly aren’t indestructible. If your dog breezes through standard rawhide alternatives, just know these might not keep them occupied for hours.

**Perks**  
- Bone-shaped design for easy gripping.  
- Rawhide-free and made with 100% real ingredients.  
- Highly digestible, even for sensitive stomachs.  
- Chicken wrapping adds flavor dogs love.  

**Caveats**  
- Won’t last long for aggressive chewers.  
- Packaging mentions 25 chews, but the count varies slightly in rare cases.

**Other Options in the Market**  
Comparatively, products like SmartBones and DreamBone Chews have positioned themselves as rawhide-free alternatives. While those are great options, Hartz Oinkies Chew Bones seem to have a slight advantage in retaining that natural flavor from real chicken breast. DreamBone introduces vegetable-based ingredients for dogs with different dietary needs, but their durability under heavy chewing doesn’t quite match what this product offers. On the flip side, SmartBones occasionally seems to come in larger sizes, which might be more suitable for larger breeds. Ultimately, the choice often comes down to your dog’s size, chewing habits, and flavor preferences.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
The pricing for these chew bones feels solid, given the quality of ingredients and the convenience of a resealable bag that keeps them fresh over time. While not the cheapest dog treat on the market, the combination of digestibility, flavor, and rawhide-free construction make it worth every penny. Budget-conscious pet owners might find other rawhide-free chews at slightly lower price points, but these strike a great balance between price and quality, especially for smaller to medium breeds.

1msycaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1msycaf/help_with_roommates_really_awfully_behaved_cat/,Help with roommates really awfully behaved cat?,"hi all i’ve been living with my roommate for about 3 months now. We both attend the same college and we’re staying over summer break for internships we have in the city- we’re also planning to live together for fall semester until she graduates then I will have the apartment to myself as I still have another year of school left after her move out date.

We met in class and were friendly but not friends we mostly agreed to live together to make the rent cheaper for the summer. She’s a good roommate other than her cat Squeegee who has lowkey been a problem since day one.

About two weeks before we were set to move in my roommate texted me asking if she could bring her cat, i felt bad about it but i politely said no as im allergic to cats- she responded saying he was hypoallergenic so it wouldn’t be a problem and said he was excited to meet me, so I didn’t really push back even though I didn’t want this cat in our apartment (which is my fault i’ll admit) 

We moved in together and set up the place for a week before the cat came. The first night he immediately peed everywhere and scratched our coffee table so my roomate started keeping him in her bedroom. The new problem is he howls all night now. Whenever my roomate is gone he is screaming, i’m normally out of the apartment more than she is so it’s not a huge deal but when im on a call or a meeting it’s very frustrating. The cat also hisses and scratches me. I don’t bother the cat, i don’t look at him, i don’t approach him, I’ve given him maybe one treat when I first met him and that was our sole interaction, so I’m not sure if he’s just aggressive? But sometimes when i walk by he just lunges at me. 

He was a former feral cat and spent most of his life outside but my roomate makes him be an indoor cat even though he cried all day to be let out- which honestly seems cruel in my opinion (i get that they’re safer indoors but this cat lived its whole life outside and it’s clearly still in his instinct to explore after 3 months inside) My roommate is a sweetie but someone i feel like she focuses on what she wants out of the cat more than what is good for him, he has boots he wear he clearly doesn’t like she sleeps in bed with him and then complains of scratches when she cuddles him in the night (i’m not a cat expert obviously but i think if the cat is scratching and biting her when being cuddled it means he doesn’t like it) In my completely inexperienced opinion i think the cat is still completely feral and would probably be a good barn cat, but isn’t suitable for apartment living. The poor thing is obese as she constantly feeds him so he’s an absolute unit which makes it hard to contain him.

what do i do here? I feel bad making her give the cat back to her family because she is VERY concerned about Squeegee being outside…even though he has lived the majority of his life outdoors.

He pees all over even during the day time now and I don’t know what to do. My roommate does a good job of cleaning up but the apartment smells like literal pee and litter all the time.  I don’t blame the cat really he's just an animal and im glad he's not feral anymore and gets to be cared and loved. But I don’t know what to do here? I'm stuck with this diva of a cat until December and he is making my QOL so ass. My roomate kinda babies him and does't disisplne when he scratches bites, pees and he's not my cat so I don't want to cross a line. I have only had dogs and rodents so I know literally nothing about cats other than they are shady and hard to please lol, so any advice on how to mend this behavior without crossing a line would be super helpful. Also just for my peace of mind is it okay for an outdoor cat to be kept indoor, I know some cats stay inside all the time but is that ethical if a cat is used to free-roaming? Idk y'all help.

Edit: sorry for bad grammar  and typos I refuse to use Ai., 

Edit: to clear things up the cat has 5 litter boxes (yep) two big cat trees, scratching posts, and my roomate plays ""enrichment"" games with him, like cat puzzles and shit but tbh I think that benefits her more than him bc what cat wants to do a puzzle. He went to vet a few months ago and the vet said the pee was purely behavioral. And he gets free roam of the apartment during the day, only at night is he with roomate (not saying thats right but its just whats happening)",1,1755454799.0,CatAdvice,6,1.0,False
1msyc8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1msyc8q/good_news/,Good news,"Well, good news and bad news. The good news is that I got a job with solid hours that give me enough time to earn some money while paying off my debts, helping with bills and even having a little money left over for myself/savings after the first few paychecks. Like for my job I earn $23 an hour and only work about 22 hours a week across 4 days. (Usually. Usually 3x 6.5 hour days and 1x 4.5-5 hour days) as a pizza chef in a tech company and my head chef said there will opportunities for more hours to do things like help out at events or whatever. So that's pretty good. The pay is solid and the hours are pretty good for someone who gets easily overloaded and is always exhausted due to the sedation from. Antipsychotics. But the bad part is the commute is pretty bad and I start really early. Like to get my morning routine done (Shower, properly clean my room, eat breakfast ect) I would need to wake up around 4:30am. And I usually don't get home until around 4:30pm if I take the bus and don't pay for a ride share. So that is 12 hour days even if only 6.5 of them are spent working. Sometimes closer to 10 hour days if I just want to sleep in. But due to how sedated and exhausted I always am 10-12 hours of sleep usually isn't enough. Which fucking sucks. I have a good job with solid hours and pay and I need to take less if I don't wanna be exhausted all the time and I hate it. Like I try everything a fuck ton of caffeine pills with l-theanine and even then I'm still exhausted that most of the time I just wanna pay for a ride home instead of taking the bus. Which normally wouldn't be so bad but I have enough financial responsibilities at the moment where I can't really afford to do so. So because it's such a good set up, not only the hours and pay. But the fact that I work in a tech company means everything is always so clean and official. We have their own coffee machine with so many options, and a soda machine. And I told my chef about my Schizophrenia on day 1 and he seemed supportive. (But you never know) And obviously opportunities for more hours at times. So yeah rgood job in the long run if I can make it past the first month to get my finances in order to be able to afford ride shares for shorter commutes and more time to rest after a long day. So yeah good news if I can survive the month. Wish me luck 🤞🏾🍀",3,1755454795.0,schizophrenia,2,0.81,False

1msyboa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightscribe/comments/1msyboa/what_if_i_told_you_the_military_survival_school/,"What If I Told You the Military Survival School Near Cusic, WA, Was a Cryptid Response Facility?","I have a crazy story to tell you, and at the end, you’re probably not going to believe me. However, for those who have lived near or spent time in the Colville National Forest, they will know.

As a kid, I always got excited as soon as the snow in the mountains started to melt off here in the Pacific Northwest. We always knew it was time for fishing, Boy Scout summer camp, and so much more. However, the thing I looked forward to most was spending time in the family cabin up near the Colville National Forest.  A few times each summer, my family would make the trip from our small town just outside Spokane, WA, up to the family cabin located just off Interstate 20 near what is now the Kalispell Casino. I would get so excited when I got out of school on a Friday and my parents were loading up the car. I just knew where we were going. Especially when they would hand my cousins and me new cap guns. You see, our family loved going up to the cabin to ride around on three-wheelers, practice target shooting with firearms, and fish. However, at our young ADHD-riddled age, shooting with the adults was not quite on the menu. Instead, we got to run around playing cowboys and robbers with our cap guns. Who didn’t want to be a Texas Ranger in the ’90s?

When I was around 8, I remember a trip we took to the cabin more vividly than any other.   Like all the other summers, I remember pulling up in front of my house laughing, and screaming on the school bus with my buddies, like any other kid would on the final day of school before summer.

We lived in a mobile home park, and the school bus would drop me off at my place. Lucky me not having to walk blocks to get home.

Just as I said, though, I remember pulling up in front of my house as a kid, and I saw my parents outside loading up the old '82 Chevy Blazer we had, and saw that brand-new western-style cap pistol sitting in its package on the hood of that black SUV. This summer was about to start off exactly how I wanted it to. I literally jumped up and grabbed my JanSport backpack, and ran off the school bus. My dad immediately told me I needed to go to my room, take off my school shoes and clothes, and switch into my weekend clothes. We are headed to the cabin for the weekend. (I don’t know how many others this had, but we didn’t have a lot of money growing up. It’s not like we are pore; we just had to budget. So, you had your nice clothes, and you had your clothes you could beat up as a kid.

Not more than 10 minutes later, I was crawling up into that truck and the back seat. I had my teal Game Color in my hand with my copy of Pokémon Yellow ready for the hour-long trip to the cabin, though it felt like it took forever to get there. I always knew we were getting close as the big buildings in Spokane would start to disappear and the tall evergreen pine trees would start to appear all along the sides of the roads, jutting into the sky on top of the rock faces, a gray and brown assortment. The smell of the air would always become so much clearer, and the world would just get a bit quieter. Even with the country music blaring from the radio of my dad’s truck. Yeah, I know, typical 90s kid from the trailer park blaring country music out of an 80s truck or SUV, but I loved it.

After what felt like forever, we would always see this little gas station or convenience store in the middle of nowhere off to the right just before we made our left turn. You just knew you were minutes away when you saw this place. My father would flip on the blinker, and my excitement level would skyrocket. Trees everywhere, and a red and white convenience store would be the last of any city-type life we would see for the rest of the weekend.

We would follow this road now for a while. Nothing but a long two-lane road and trees for miles on either side. Then my father would slow down, trying to find the entrance amongst all the trees on the right-hand side. As he saw it, he would slowly pull down into this narrow entrance and begin pulling into the driveway type of area.

Not your typical driveway you would see in the city. Instead, you would see this tall double-story gray cabin with red window accents on the right side. Behind it was a red barn with the white doors that stored the three-wheelers and dirt bikes. In front of the cabin was the driveway type area that had a sitting spot in the middle of it with a fire pit. Almost like a large circle made of dirt roads with a fireplace in the middle. All around was nothing but trees and hills to take in.

Quiet and peaceful until we kids jumped out of the cars and took off running like banshees. Finger pistols everywhere, as we didn’t yet have our cap guns. A group of young boys just having a good time making “pew-pew” sounds at each other and arguing over whether we had been shot.

Shortly after, our parents would call us all over and tell us to help carry everything inside. When you walked up to the entrance of the cabin, there was a large red door with a small gray stoop. The stoop was level with the rocky ground in front of it and had a storage space to the left of the entrance. An adult would always open this trunk-shaped storage to turn on the propane to the cabin. This cabin was old enough that it had no electricity inside it other than the battery-operated stereo we brought with us. All the lighting was propane, and any heating or cooking was done with wood.  

When you stepped inside the cabin. To the right was a kitchen, and to the left were two long tables stacked behind one another, allowing around 10 – 12 people to comfortably sit and eat or play cards. This entire area was surrounded by windows. Further to the right, behind the kitchen, was a small hallway that would lead to the large bedroom on the right, and to the left, a bedroom full of bunk beds for us kids. If you continued straight on from the entrance, you would enter the living room. There was a yellow couch to the right, and to the left was a gray couch with a fireplace sitting in front of it. Behind the yellow couch was a large set of stairs leading up to the top room full of extra beds.

One of the things that is funny to think about, and you’ll get a bit later on, is a sign that was nailed to the wall beside the front door. It had a small boy and his dog, and said no peeing off the porch. You see, this place was also old enough that it didn’t have running water. To use the bathroom, you would go out the back door that was beside the stairs in the living room, and to an outhouse just outside the wood stoop.

We had been told a fun story about this wooden stoop. Before I was even born, the family came up to this log cabin one year and was having their normal fun weekend. However, they had also had a bit of alcohol during dinner and later ventured out to the wood fire in the middle of the night. While out at that wood fire, listening to the crackle of the wood and laughing at their jokes and ghost stories. They heard an odd sound coming from just behind them, off in the woods, along with a snapping of branches and a sloshing of foliage. Something was definitely off a way moving in the woods. They could also hear what sounded like sniffing or maybe snorting. For the rest of the night, they all decided to make their way back inside and load one of the firearms. We are up in bear country, and this is not a time to be without protection.

With alcohol, what goes in must come out. My Aunt, along with my mom, grabbed the 12-gauge and proceeded out to the outhouse along the back side of the house, still pitch dark as the cabin has no lighting out back. The only light they had was a cheap light from the 90s, no LEDs here, and a kerosene lantern. Mom told my aunt to go ahead and go to the outhouse, and she would stand inside the little wood stoop and look out the window for her. Jolene grabbed a lantern and ventured off to the outhouse to begin her business. After a few seconds, she heard that sound again from earlier. The crackling behind her and some sniffing. She called out to my mom, “Hey, do you see anything? I swear I hear something”. My mom proceeded to move the flashlight around, but saw nothing and told her it was the booze. My aunt, still on edge, finished her business and opened the outhouse. She started to make it to the wood stoop just as she heard that sound again, and smelled a horrid smell. This time, the sound seemed closer and still behind her. She slowly turned around and raised her lantern as the black silhouette in front of her took on detail from being lit up. It was nearly 10 feet tall, smelled horrible, was covered in fur, and had either long claws or what could have been fingers like a human. My aunt finally broke her panic as she could only figure out that a bear was snorting while looking at her. She turned and ran for the cabin, knowing shooting the thing would only make things worse. What was puzzling was that whatever it was never gave chase.

They slammed the door shut and proceeded into the house to tell the guys what had just happened. From there, they said they took turns through the night, staying up and watching through the windows. Outside, some similar sounds to earlier, no one saw it again. As daylight broke and my aunt came back down the stairs. She was greeted by a few people sitting around the fire in the living room, drinking coffee. They all flipped her crud because she swore up and down that it couldn’t have been a bear. After she thought about it through the night, she swore it was way too tall for a bear. Still to this day, the family gives her nothing but grief.

I have always found this story to be interesting. I often wonder what her experience was like in person. However, I, too, can share a similar experience.

That same summer that I first heard this story, I sat around the campfire eating S’mores and playing with my cap-gun while the adults drank their beer and indulged in the cool of the night. It may have been my uncle trying to scare me, but I swear I heard a crackling noise from behind me, too. That clear air at times was also not as clean and piney-smelling as it was earlier in the day. Have you ever had the feeling that something was watching you, that something was just waiting for you to move so it could jump out and scare you? This was the feeling that I soon got while staring into that fire and chewing on my roasted marshmallow. All the hair went up on the back of my neck, and I wanted to go inside where it was lighter. My uncle swore it was just a figure of my imagination, but I don’t think it was.

That very night, while lying asleep in my bottom bunk. I woke up to my cousin asking if I needed to go ""potty"". He was scared and didn’t want to go on his own. I didn’t have to go, but being a nice cousin, I decided to follow him out. There was no way we wanted to go to the outhouse, so he decided to pee off the front porch instead. We stepped out onto the porch, and it was fairly dark outside. You could see the smoldering fire pit and the cars just under the moonlight. Almost like a light blue hue of light being contrasted over the parking area. We both giggled about him peeing off the porch because he was now an outlaw, and I would have to chase him down in the morning with my Colt cap pistol. The sign was posted, no peeing off the porch. We could smell something acrid in the wind, and my cousin picked on me, saying that I had farted, and he now had to smell it while peeing. I swore it wasn’t me and blamed him instead. Nothing was more innocent than two boys, eight and seven years of age, having a fun time in the dark, giving each other little jabs about who farted outside and giggling their heads off. We eventually made our way back inside, locked the door, and headed back to our bunks.

Shortly after climbing into my bunk and getting warm. Now my body said that I had to pee too. Of course, I couldn’t have needed to go while we were both outside. I tried the normal roll over, and maybe it will go away. But this just made it worse. I always thought of myself to be the brave one and figured I could go on my own this time. I crawled out of my bed and slowly made my way back to the front porch. I dropped my trousers around my legs and proceeded to pee off the porch, drawing lines in the ground while I was doing it. I could still smell that nasty smell from earlier, only this time it was slightly brighter outside. I swore I saw something standing in the woods on the hill just behind where the cars had been parked. Remembering that story of my aunt’s experience, I was a bit scared and about turned and ran into the house. However, I still had my trousers wrapped around my legs. As I turned around to run into the house, I fell flat on my face inside the door. I then ripped up my pants, half jumped and half ran to my room while slamming the door behind me.  

The next morning, we woke to the smell of bacon and eggs being cooked. My cousin and I slowly crawled out of the bunk and started to make our way to the dining room area. Of course, he was still giving me a ration of crap about farting on him last night. We pulled ourselves into a chair, pulled out our Gameboys and started playing more Pokémon. My mom heard us and turned over to the two of us, asking, “Can’t you go one weekend without those silly games?”. We giggled to ourselves and continued trying to catch them all.

The rest of the morning was uneventful until we all went outside to have some fun on the three-wheelers. My cousin and I stepped outside along with my uncle and my dad. As we stepped onto the stoop, I looked up to the location I remembered seeing that thing last night and remembered feeling a bit scared. My uncle, noticing I was staring off, asked what I was looking at. I proceeded to explain to him, while pointing up into the wooded hills in front of us, that last night, while peeing, I swear I saw a tall bear or something up there. At this age, I wasn’t sure what it was; it was just tall and looking at me. My uncle laughed and told me that perhaps I shouldn’t be spending as much time in the evening with the adults and their horror stories. I continued to try to explain that I wasn’t making it up, but he was sure that I was just a kid seeing things.

My uncle brought out the two three-wheelers from the red barn, one for him and my cousin, the second for my dad and me. He then strapped a gun to the front of his three-wheeler; my uncle always had a gun with him up here. We then all climbed on our three-wheelers and proceeded to pull out. We turned to the right and headed towards some logging roads that ran miles around the cabin and other properties up there. About a hundred feet or so down the path, you come to this steep road that levels out and heads out onto these logging trails. As we started down the hill, I swear I could smell something again and nearly started to panic. However, I remembered I was with my father and uncle, and there was no way anything could go wrong. We finished descending the steep hill and proceeded to turn left onto the dirt roads. The dirt roads up in these parts are not that typical dark brown you would expect, as there is a lot of sand mixed in as well. It was more of a white and yellow hue, the color of the beach, and surrounded by trees. Now, the area where the trees are is that typical brown soil you would expect up here in Washington.

As we raced along these roads with the three-wheelers, I felt the first time of feeling adrenaline rush on one of these things. Not quite like a fast car, but that feeling of going fast and having nothing holding you in. The wind blowing across your face and dust from the three-wheeler in front of you spitting all over the place, it was a stellar time. We rode for a few miles, making all sorts of bends and turns until we came up to another steep drop off you could see car tracks. This was off the right of the road, and you could smell and hear fresh water. We slowly pulled off the road with our three-wheelers and rode down this steep hill. When you got to the bottom of the hill, you could see another trail that veered off to the right, and then we would continue forward down a trail that went through some trees and down to the river.

This is where we would dismount and walk the side of the river for a bit to get fresh water to bring back to the cabin and boil. This was my first time seeing a river like this roaring through in front of us. It was about 10 feet wide and nearly a foot or two deep in most places. However, the further down you walked it would get to only a few inches deep, and you could cross over it. The river was embraced by shorter green shrubs all down the sides of it, with the typical evergreen jutting up from the sides as well. As we walked along the side of the river to a little clearing to fill our water jugs. I noticed what looked like a set of huge footprints off the right side in some muddy spots. I pointed them out to my father and asked him what they could be. They looked to be similar to a human, however, just larger. I would say they looked to be nearly three times as big as my dad’s, and he has a huge foot.

I proceeded to tell my dad what I saw the night before and asked him if this could be from that bear. He laughed and looked over at me. After rubbing my head like he always did, he knelt and pointed at the footprint and told me that a bear’s foot looks completely different. That this was likely someone having fun trying to make it look like a Sasquatch or Bigfoot was here. He told me they have big shoes you can wear that make it look like a real Bigfoot was standing somewhere. When I asked him what a Bigfoot was, he explained it to me as a tall human with fur all over, and they didn’t smell too good because they didn’t take baths. He told me that if I didn’t make sure to take baths, I too would smell like a big foot. He even joked and said that I already kind of smelled like one. I think he saw the fear in my eyes, because he told me that it’s just a scary story, and they don’t exist. It’s only a myth that people like to tell around the campfire to scare each other.

We filled up our water containers and then proceeded to turn around and start hiking back to our three-wheelers. As we got about halfway back up the bank, two men that we didn’t know started to walk towards us. They were both in camo-like clothing with big guns on their backs and all sorts of pouches and things strapped all over themselves. My dad told me to wait behind him and started to walk up to the two men. My dad got a way ahead of me, and while I couldn’t hear what they had been saying, I could hear them talking and see my dad waving his hands around in an irritated fashion.  The man then pulled something out of his pocket and showed it to my dad before placing it back into his pocket. My dad shook his head and then turned around and walked towards me as the two men proceeded to cross the river and stop over in another clearing. I watched them start to kneel as my father touched my shoulder. I look back up at him, and he said that the two men are with the military and are training in the area. He said that we needed to go back to the cabin now.

We came back to where we had dismounted from our three-wheeler and met up with my uncle. He, too, had made his way back with my cousin and had their jug filled. They talked with each other for a bit while my cousin and I ran around with sticks pretending to be cops and bandits again. They called us both back over to our three-wheelers, and we climbed on and headed back towards the cabin. This time, though, we didn’t take the normal way I was used to as a kid. Instead of going left to head back to that tall hill, we took a right and rode on for a while through some cool twists and turns I had not seen before. Eventually, we came to an area where you could either take a right and go down another road, or you could take a left across a cattle guard and go over a small cement bridge. We proceeded to take the left across the cattle guard and bridge and then up the hill just across from them. After about another 10 minutes, it felt like we could see what looked like buildings and fencing to the right off the road, popping up in the trees. We went a bit forward and came to a stop. My dad and uncle pointed and then talked for a bit before proceeding forward. It looked like there was tall fencing with barbed wire on it, a giant building made of cement, and all sorts of huge green tents. Parked outside these huge green tents where big trucks with what I thought at the time was a tent on the back of them.

As we got about halfway past this area, two men were sitting outside what I think was the entrance to the place. My dad and uncle pulled over to talk to the men. At first, the men smoking cigarettes and dressed like the two men we saw earlier paid no attention to my father and uncle. My father eventually got off his three-wheeler and made a coughing sound as he walked over, saying, “Excuse me”. The two men, either out of agitation or being caught off guard, reached for their rifles and asked how they could help. My father stopped and took a slight step back. He told them we were down by the river earlier, and two men claiming to be military had asked that we leave the area while they trained. The two men then turned around and started talking quietly with one another. They turned back around and told my father that yes, they are currently training. They told us that all they can say is that the two men who talked with us are not military but are currently with the military, and their instructions needed to be listened to. They said that we can go back down the river in the next day or two, but that it is currently off limits. My father tried to explain that it was our only method of getting water around here, but was cut off and told that it is off limits for now. If we needed water, we could come talk to these guys, and they would get us some provisions. My father, though confused and irritated, turned around and got back on our three-wheeler.

We proceeded to head back to the cabin and begin to unload the water jugs and tell everyone what had happened while down at the river. One of our other uncles, who has spent the most time up here, said that he had never heard of such a thing. He knew there was an old survival school up here. However, it had been abandoned since the 80s. He said not to worry, though, we are leaving tomorrow, and have plenty of food and water.

That night, I can remember we had my favorite meal of all time. Grilled steaks and suddenly salad. For those who don’t have a sudden salad around them. It’s like this salad with small shell noodles, bits of carrots and peas, then filled with bacon, and like a dill ranch dressing. It’s the best food, outside of tacos. Back to the point, though, I remember sitting down for dinner that night a bit later than normal. We were outside by the fire just as the sun was going down, eating dinner and talking about what we had to do in the morning to get ready to leave. My dad stopped eating for a second a coughed, then looked at my uncle and said, “damn, did you eat a dead skunk? That one stinks”. My uncle looked back at him in confusion and said he didn’t do it this time. My dad turned to his left and looked at me, and I started to giggle and told him it wasn’t me either. I thought my dad did it and was blaming me until I too smelled it. I still thought for a second it was my dad; however, it was just like that smell from last night.

 All the hair stood up on the back of my neck as I realized there looked to be something huge standing back near the entranceway to the cabin’s driveway. I pointed it out to my father, but when he turned, there was nothing there. Off to the right, about the distance of four or five cars, I could see what looked like two glowing eyes in the distance and a dark figure again. But there is no way a bear can move this fast, right? I thought back to that Bigfoot story my dad told me and asked my dad if Bigfoot was fast. He told me again they don’t exist; however, I pointed in the direction of it again right as it disappeared again.

 Now, my father, getting a bit annoyed, told me it’s just my imagination. He said he could show me and started to head to his truck. In his truck, he had a big light that was connected to the cigarette lighter that would light up everything around when he used it. He opened the door to his truck, grabbed the light, and turned it on, pointing it into the woods. Just moments after, we could hear a deep guttural growl from the woods. My dad even heard it this time and quickly swung the beam of the light to the right side, lighting up everything in its path. We heard a swooshing sound and what looked like a tree bent for a second and then snapped right back into position as all the surrounding brush moved. My father yelled, “What the heck was that?”.

My father, still holding the light in the direction this happened, slowly started to back towards us. However, the cable for the light was only so long, and while walking backwards, he stumbled over an exposed tree root, falling backwards and ripping the light out of the socket in the truck. Everything immediately went black as my uncle dashed to my father to help him up. As they got my father back up on his feet, they ran to the truck to try to plug the light back in; however, we heard the door slam in front of them as they stopped and looked at our truck. At this time, two silhouettes stepped towards my father and uncle and stopped. I could hear talking, but not what they had been saying. The men, along with my father and uncle, proceeded back to our campfire. It was the two men from the base we had met earlier. They said that the two guys from the river we met had been practicing how to catch a bear alive, so that it could be released back into the wild.

The stench again picked up as a breeze ripped through our campfire, and the two men stared off to the right. One of the men grabbed his rifle, and the other started talking on his radio. All we heard was “target sighted! Net fired…bagged”. “Wait, the target is loose, repeat, the target is loose!” At this point, the two men with us told us that we had to get inside and lock the doors. The bear is loose and may be agitated. My father scooped me up, and my uncle did the same with my cousin while running inside.  We got inside and sat down at the kitchen table while my uncle stared out the window, and my father told the others what was going on. Our older uncle then made his way swiftly to the cabinet in the kitchen and pulled out what looked to be an old radio with a receiver on it. He turned it on, and it started buzzing and making all sorts of odd sounds. He then started twisting the dials until we could all of a sudden hear men talking and yelling on the walkie. We heard, “No! Not Richards!” “Damn it!” then radio silence again. Shortly after “The second net was successful, we have bagged the target and are ready to return”.

My uncle said that he believes they were just catching a bear in the area and are going to relocate it. However, in all of my years of hiking near the cabin since. I have seen multiple bears. None of which had that smell, let alone that height and speed. The military area is still open and used to this day. However, it has no markings telling you what it is. The building made of concrete looks to be rather large, more like it’s trying to hold something in and not necessarily out of it. It also now has these large red lights on the outside of it, almost as a warning sign should one ever be needed. Some don’t believe in the cryptids of the Colville National Forest; however, I still do. Remember, next time you’re up in the woods and smell something off., or you feel like you’re being watched, you just might be.",1,1755454758.0,Nightscribe,0,1.0,False

If I didn’t reply, I’ll admit I feel a little embarrassed to jump back into your inbox after days of silence.

So, here I am, reposting because I’m still genuinely hoping to meet someone I can connect with. Someone I can share how my day went, laugh at random things with, and maybe have those late-night talks that make time fly.

25, working in healthcare with a busy, shifting schedule (but I make time to chat, otherwise I wouldn’t be here). More of a homebody and a certified coffee addict 😬. From Visayas, so distance might be a factor. 5’2”, morena, normal BMI, and yes, I wear glasses (legally blind po tayo, opo)

About you:
25 - 28. Preferably tall, fair skinned, and with a normal BMI. Someone I find nice to look at (physical attraction does matter too 🙈). Kind, sincere, and genuinely interested in connecting. Bonus points if you’re a coffee person too, so we can be caffeine buddies hanggang mamataey 💀. Extra points if you also work in healthcare, since it makes connecting easier

I’m open to swapping photos early on to see if we click. If you’re up for good chats, inside jokes, and a little harmless banter, send me a message. Let’s see where this goes.

Ciao!

1msyal5,https://i.redd.it/7wc79aukcmjf1.jpeg,[Cover] Are Jade and Obsidian out of Canon?,"I just read an article from a couple years ago that said Jade and Obsidian were out of continuity and replaced by Ruby and Harlequin's son. I'm not sure if the replacements are still in canon either.   
I'm not finding a lot of information about it online.  
Although I did find a coffee company named Jade and Elise Obsidian.  
I know they were around for Infinite Frontier in 2021.  
Has anyone seen them recently, or know what did or didn't happen to them?

On a side note, I always thought Obsidian's powers were odd to come from Alan Scott. I know they said it was shadow energy from Ian Karkull. So why not make him Ian's kid? In COIE, Obsidian said his shadow form was just like the shadow demons, so why not use that? Beast Boy or Fire would have made more sense to be Alan's kid to me, at least they're green like Jade too. If any of them still exist.

1msyafg,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1msyafg/lingering_new_cafe_layout_question/,Lingering New Cafe Layout Question,"Apologize for the redundant questioning on this subject - looking for some strong opinions borne from real world experience on our last major unresolved layout decision: Where to put the dishwasher?

I'm designing a donut-coffee shop for a first time business owner. Several people said in my previous post that the owners should hire a consultant, and that was my advice to them too. They've now done that - they've hired a [consultant!](https://blackrabbitservice.com/) She also is selling/leasing them all of their coffee related equipment.

We've resolved a lot design issues with the consultant's input, but she was unwavering on her wanting the commercial undercounter dishwasher to go in the back - in the kitchen (donuts) area in our case.

I was unsure when we first began the design (never having worked in cafe or coffee shop), but after talking with numerous baristas and owners around town, the consensus was 100% out front, by both those who currently had their dishwasher out front and those who had it in the back.

I had a 3-way conference with the owner and the consultant yesterday, and when I had any question about the advice she had given to my client previously, she simply replied, whatever the client wants to do - she would not discuss her reasoning behind any of her recommendations. And the majority of her suggestions were unquestionably very good, but if she could tell us more about the criteria behind them, they could help us shape the final design.

In my last posts on this subject, three people came out strongly in favor of out front, with a few qualifications, such as locating the dishwasher were steam won't effect displays and not interfere with workflow, etc.

My client wants to believe someone - **I'm puzzled as to why there could be such could be such a black and white distinction between the recommendations of people currently working as a baristas and the expert.** Anyone want to weight in with their own experience on the best undercounter dishwasher location? Ever worked at a place with it out front and another place with it in the back?

Here's the latest plan:

The one with a broken hearted voice, and anger all at the same time. The look you gave me broke me, and I still think of the pain in your eyes, and the look that went right through me. If looks would kill I would've been dead. I pushed you away with no intention of ever doing that, my mother got her liver transplant at the time and I was overwhelmed. I took out my frustration, my fears, and my pain out on you. You told me just a few days before you wanted to get married, and take my last name. I wanted that, god I wanted that. When I held you close time would stop still, when I looked into your eyes you were everything I ever wanted, and time together it felt right to me always, I felt love a love and appreciation I'd never experienced in my life. I miss the cute good morning wake up looking me in the eyes, and you'd say how'd you sleep? And give me a kiss, it was the sweetest thing ever and I'd hold you close. We'd have coffee, let the dogs out, take a shower together . You'd cook breakfast, and we'd go for walks in the park. You tried disc golf with me once, we'd feed squirrels grapes, we'd sit in the hammock , cuddle up on the couch watch movies, talk, joke, and smoke our vape pens. We'd get Starbucks we had a whole life planned out together, then it all just disappeared in an instant because I hurt you. How I wish I could go back to that day, I'd tell myself to just breathe you were just trying to be there for me. And I pushed you away. 
But why the night when I came back by to talk to you you were on the couch next to him, right after we had just broken up? Did I not mean that much to you, was he there the whole time?? Was he coming over and holding you when I was gone? Is that why you went to bed early, and never text me when you were with your (girlfriends) if they came over, or you went out on lunch or dinner? Was it him, because you'd never just send me a hey I'm maybe are doing this I miss you text. 
You were supposed to fly out to l.a. to spend time with me while I went back to work. I still text you and said I wish you'd still come. I got sent to Portland for a few days instead because I told them I just couldn't do go to L.A. then I got sent to New York City that was the hardest thing for me because we were making plans to go see that and explore together. I got stuck there for a week and a half, it I cried everyday. It was hard getting up and pushing forward but I did it. After that I got flew to L.A. for a few days I felt a gut punch the entire time. From there I got sent back to New York and I was there for about 3 weeks. But one of those days being on Valentine's Day, good lord that was a hard day. I missed you, thought about you your smile, your laugh. And the guys played nothing but heartbreak songs on our hour drive back from Queens to Long Beach. I cried the entire time, I felt as if I was just losing myself. But even so after everything, the days get easier but you never fade. You're there in my thoughts daily, in my feelings, and in my gut. I know you feel me too, there's no denying that. We just don't lose that sense we have for each other like that. You were special to me, I still love you dearly, and think of you all the time. You were my right person wrong time, and even after everything I'd still welcome you with open arms, and tell you I loved you even if you called. I whisper in the wind i love you every day 
I hope one day your life blossoms into as beautiful as you are a 🌻 
I felt like I needed to send this out to the world with hopes that it would reach you, and you'd reach out to me. 
I walked into a grocery store the other day, and hold my girl was playing. It cut me like a knife stopped me dead in my tracks and made me say god I miss and love you *** I've never heard that song anywhere except when you'd play it, or on my phone. You introduced me to that. Was you trying to tell me you still love me too?

Pics are from the showing, so a few things are different now:

*We use the lower counter near the window as a coffee/tea station, and I'd love to maintain this 

*We use the center tower as a pseudo appliance garage. I do love having an appliance garage, and did request outlets inside the boxes, but I'm not sure if I want it in a different spot.... 

*Our kitchen table is a deep reddish brown colour (I think it's mahogany? It's a set from my grandma so idk) 

Things I know I want:

*Deep drawers on the lower cabinets, 

*Single level island 

*Cabinets all the way to the top 

*A French door fridge. Probably counter top depth because of the way the pantry opens. Originally I picked the LG studio counter depth max, but since we're getting new stuff I don't know if I need to stick with white appliances anymore so.... 

*Raising the counter a couple inches. Right now it's like 36/37 inches, at our old house our counters were probably around 40? 

Things I'm not sure about:

*Keeping the one counter lower for a coffee station? 

*Extending the island all the way to the wall? Theres a walking path there anyways. But also, we have our tall trash can and diaper genie at the end there right now and I'm not sure where I'd put it if we closed it off. So what if we only extend the counter and don't put cabinets? But also if we do that we still can't open the trash can since it's a step open 

*I love baking so if there's anything we can do to streamline that, that's great

Is it Fall Already?","Even though it’s the 17^(th) of August and technically still summer, there are indicators that fall is rapidly approaching.  Have you checked out the street trees on Central Avenue? More to the point, have you seen the appearance of yellow and brown leaves on the ground?

The biggest sign came in the form of lots of traffic around Alameda High School signaling that school is back in session. My HC (human companion) usually walks right into the Starbucks on Park Street for a Green Tea Latte and the occasional pupuccino for me. No line, no waiting. As of Monday, the place was packed so he makes sure that he is in and out before 8 AM.

I had been monitoring the progress of the new security gates at Alameda High, and it looks like the construction crew that was responsible for building the security gates finished just in time for opening day.

Since we are on the subject of Alameda schools, I took a short detour from my regular walking route to check out the progress on the new Wood School at the foot of Grand Street. There are several large concreate pads ready for the steel framing, some of which is currently going up on the back pads. The grand opening looks very far away. Maybe for opening day 2026?

Fortunately for those Alamedans anticipating the opening of Park Station on the corner of Park Street and San Jose Avenue, your wait is almost over. The outside is ready to go including the long list of dog rules. Item number seven is a deal breaker for me. So, I guess I will be getting takeout.

While I was on Park Street, I noticed a small box of what my HC said were VHS tapes. He though they might be the last vestiges of the video rental store which replaced tapes like these with wigs. Do people really rent wigs??  While checking out the pupuccinos at Highwire Coffee, I noticed the dog parking sign and a place to hold my leash.  Nice touch guys. Thanks for thinking of us.

On a more serious note, I checked out the scene of what seemed like a pretty serious accident. It looks like some Yahoo was speeding and sideswiped a parked car and then continued into a utility box bending the big cement filled pipe that was put there to prevent damage. I think the design team needs to run some new calculations.

Over the years, I have seen some pretty interesting vehicles on the street, and this pass week, I saw a really unusual paint job on a Range Rover. It had strips of gold and these swaths of metallic green and orange. The pictures do not do justice to the real thing. Any ideas on how this work of art was created?

I hope everyone had a good summer even if the sun decided not to participate. Here’s hoping for a warmer September.
