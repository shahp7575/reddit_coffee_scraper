1gi7rep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gi7rep/is_he_limerent_obsessed_bpd_or_anxious_attachment/,Is he limerent? obsessed? bpd or anxious attachment? He watches me for hours straight? am i in danger? ,"I met him for the first time 7 weeks ago, i went up to him after the opening day of our first evening school semester, i asked where a classroom is, he told me to wait he will use the toilet and come back fast, he did and took me there, he was eager to help me and i thought he was very friendly, i thought he was introverted and calm too, anyways i went to him while he was leaving and introduced myself, i am muslim and wear a headscarf btw, he is an atheist, i even shook his hand since i am a friendly person, (although i wear hijab i am not that religious), then next week i talked to him, said hi, we did a group work together were we shook hands again, made a lot of eye contact a lot, the amount of chemistry i have with him is so massive, anyways, the third week, he started to sit next to me, sit directly behind me and watch me, then he asked me to grab a coffee with him and our other classmate, i said ok, he then had to go to the toilet again and told us to wait, but i decided to go to the toilet too, then i couldnt find him but i the other guy was walking next to me i could have easily known where he was but i didnt care and just went to the library, since i didnt even see it as a big deal. he had a massive anger outburst, he was literally upset from the bottom of his own heart that i didnt wait for him.

he complained in the next class to everyone, my german isnt that good and he is a native, he complained to everyone, then he saw me in hall way later on and put his arm around me and then asked ""why didnt you wait for me?"" then one of the other muslim guys said you cant touch her, and i said yes you cant and he immediately apologized and i told its fine, we talked and he complained a lot and i told him ok, let me get your number so we never have to look for each other. i regreted that, so next day i said just hallo coldly, then the whole week but he keeps on complained to the others that i am ignoring him and acting a certain way, he asked another girl out and said, since you arent muslim i guess its fine. then i officially went to him, called him and told him that we shouldnt feel uncomfortable around each other and that if i ever hurted him or stressed him out i apologize. but we were so close to each other and made eye contact literally stared into each others souls and it felt like we were hugging each other so deeply without hugging each other, not to mention he was tipsy.

then i decided to just forget everything, he tried to find ways to engage me, sit next to me etc but i never gave him chances and always sat by the window and always left early. then he became even more sulky, always mad, watching me literally watching me the whole class sitting behind me, and listening on my conversations. he hears every single word i say and understands it, its as if he has extra sensitive senses.

then he gets mad when i talk to the other guys, no guy dares sit next to me, they all feel like he will be mad if they sit next to me? then he tries to get my attention by being loud and looking at me. then one time he had to sit in the same row with me, he looked at me and tried to smile and i immediately turned around and rejected his smile. he melted down? he swallowed a tone of gums and even had to leave and came back after drinking a bottle of beer.

now he watches me and every interaction i make. also, he saw me on the tram with out other classmate and immediately when i got on, he gestured to me to go up to them? wtf, that was before the 1 week break, but why? when he doesnt even approach me in school?

he is mad i am not paying any attention, talking to him? wtf is that? even the class mates are shocked at the amount of watching, staring, attention i am getting? he mimicks me even, when i am calm or when i am mad he is literally showing same emotions, also even the way i sit everything. every week he has a new strategy he wants to try, he adapts to new boundaries i make. he is unstoppable. i saw him at 6:30 2 days ago and across the street i felt his gaze? like literally it was a feeling, i looked and it was him looking at me from across the street, we recognized each other while it was even a bit dark. wtf? thank god he got on the car he was waiting for.

wtf is that? another thing i want to add is, i am brown and an immigrant, i look very exotic and different and it seems like he really thinks i am attractive and unique, although i think i am very normal.",1,1730585257.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1gi7oc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1gi7oc3/first_marathon_done_moab_trail_marathon/,First Marathon Done (Moab Trail Marathon),"Just finished my first marathon at 5:04! It was definitely a roller coaster getting here, but I'm so proud. 

Just a little on my story in case it's helpful to anyone else. 

I followed the Nike Run Club marathon training plan and did all of my runs on the road (probably not the best for a trail run, but I couldn't train on trails unfortunately). I liked the training plan and some of the guided runs, and I would definitely recommend it for someone who is just starting the marathon journey. A lot of the runs were just timed with finishing being the only goal except for a couple of distance runs. Overall, it was a great training plan that got me to the finish. 

So here's where I'll show my ignorance to marathon training. I decided to start training and figured I would need new running shoes since mine were worn out. I've always ran in Ghost Brooks, but I figured I should go with the Ghost Brooks Max since I thought the extra cushion would help with the extra miles. I'm not sure if it was the shoes or my very particular body, but those shoes gave me terrible patella pain that made it almost impossible to run. I returned them (Brooks has an amazing return policy) after a month and got the newest Ghost model. I'm not sure if the damage was already done or if the new model caused issues, but I started getting really bad pain on the inside of my knee that caused me to have to ice and TENS my knees every night. I decided to swap to Glycerin 20s since they were recommended by a running store, and then I started to get really bad pain on the outside of my knee. I didn't incorporate much strength training into my training plan, but I'm already planning to go to a PT and follow there advice as soon as I get home. 

All of the knee issues caused me to miss the last week of my taper and I was in a panicked, anxious state the last three days because my knee was constantly bothering me. I iced my knees, took max doses of ibuprofen, used a TENS machine, and a theragun every night and my knees only slightly felt better yesterday. In a kind of ""screw it"" moment, I decided to get some KT tape and use an old knee brace that helped in the past. I'm not sure if it was the KT tape, knee brace, or ibuprofen and Tylenol (during the race at an aid station), but my knees felt great and didn't give me any issues. I'm sure there's some science mixed with placebo effect (and I know it's not recommended to take pain killers before/during a race), but I'll definitely recommend KT tape to anyone that's on the fence about trying it. 

For nutrition, I carb loaded 3 days out and drank a lot of cranberry juice. I had a protein shake with a 1/2 cup of oats and some coffee about 2 hours before the race and probably had 5 500mls of water/electrolytes/gatorade during the course and 10? Gu packs...I lost count and started just taking them when I started feeling tired. I'm really glad I brought my runner's vest with because the aid stations were six miles apart in some spots. 

Last little side note - I was torn between running in the road shoes I've been training in or running in trail running shoes that I didn't use once during the train up. I decided to stick with my road shoes and didn't have any significant issues other than rubbing and a couple of blisters (I think they might've been too loose but I didn't want to stop to retie them). The whole ""nothing new in race day"" only applied to my shoes because I ate a lot of snacks, drank a lot of electrolytes, and took electrolyte pills during my marathon that I never used during my training. That was honestly because the marathon was as much of a hike as it was a run though. 

I was a lurker in this sub and got a ton of great advice, so thank you to this community and all of the people who have contributed! I know my post is super long, but I hope it's helpful to someone. 

TLDR: My marathon training was plagued with knees issues from changing shoes and not incorporting strength training, but I finished and am super happy/proud/exhausted...and already planning the next marathon ha. 

Last side note: someone gave advice about bringing your own food the night before and it saved my life! All of the restaurants were jam packed with huge waits and I'm so thankful I brought my own food!",1,1730585015.0,Marathon_Training,0,1.0,False

I love self propelled howitzers, so I created a 3D printer file to make a British Mk 1 Gun Carrier from WW1, the first documented self propelled howitzer.  Aside from the vehicle itself, the destroyed trees and the soldiers are also 3D printed.  Used layers of foam for the terrain with potting soil used to make the muddy dirt.  Mod Podge used to create the wet looks.  Under where the vehicle is crossing the trench I made a couple of the soldiers kneeling down and looking up towards the vehicle and one each side there is a recessed cut out with sleeping soldiers.  Made a makeshift command room with all the flooring in it and the trench from wooden coffee stirring sticks.

Neither of us are so ill we will be bed bound but I really just don’t want to go anymore, it’s almost an hours drive each way. I don’t think changing the plan to something like a coffee date is going to happen as i think what’s happened is they had this plan and i was sort of an after thought invite which is absolutely fine as those 3 have stayed close and I haven’t. So really my question is would i be really a total dick to cancel on them now?

I was prepared for good food in Bologna, but the food was just incredible! Maybe because I just came from Venice, where the scenery was incredible, but the food left much to be desired. Bologna, being the food capital of Italy, was high on my list of places to visit. 

Day 1:
Took the train from Venice to Bologna. Didnt realize the highspeed was underground, so the exit to ground level seemed for ever. Walked to our airbnb, and then headed for dinner at Trattoria da Me, which I made a reso a couple weeks earlier. Food and service was really good, had the cheese icecream appetizer with crescentina, gnocchi gratin with porcini, tagliatelle with ragu, iberian pluma, veal tongue, and mascarpone crema dessert. All very good. Would have made another reso except my parents wanted something else. 

Day 2:

Had a cappuccino and bomboloni at Hangout Cafe, just near our place. Grabbed some fresh fruits at Mercato delle Erbe. Went to Palazzo Poggi, which i really enjoyed. and cheap admission too. The collection of maps was my favourite. I'm into historic science navigation and architecture. The obstetrics room was something else.  

Had lunch at Sfoglina Rina. Lined up for 10 minutes and we were in. Had the green tagliatelle with ribiola cream, potato and spinach gnocchi, and black passatelli. 

Picked up some prosciutto and pesto Genovese from Salumeria Simoni, and then some gnocchi from Sfogline for later. 

Found a run club, NUR (Not Normal Run) which was awesome. Every Wed at 7pm. I think the run leader owns Pescheria Scampo, was pretty novel meetig up for a run outside a seafood restaurant. Had a post run dinner of octopus and rice, was delicious. Finished off with gelato (crema, nicciola) at Vero Gelateria, which might be my favorite in Bologna.

Day 3:
Caught the ~9am regional train to Ravenna. Easy to buy from kiosk, just validate it using the machine nearby, and go to the correct platform. Booked the church tickets on the train, and just selected the 5min windows for the masoleum. Its a small city, and was very easy to walk from the train station to the main sites. The mosaics were incredible, especially in the masoleum, baptistery, and San Vitale. 

Lunch was at Osteria Passatelli, thanks to a reddit recco, and was the best pizza of the trip so far. Just perfect sausage truffle pizza, tagliatelle ragu, and an octopus primi. Caught the 5pm-ish train back. Was never rushed and had plenty of time to wander. 

Dinner was at Antica Osteria Romagnola, where we ordered the mortadella starters, lasagna, and the suckling pig. Even though we got the 2x portion, it was too much for the three of us and we asked for a box to go. 

Day 4:
Had to work off all those meals to make room for more, so we walked up to San Luca. Be sure to stop at Bar Billi. It was a holiday Nov 1, so this place was packed. Impressive to watch the staff serve so many espressos so quickly. The church and view is nice, but the portico walk is the highlight. 

Lunch at Trattoria Amedeo, stumbled upon this place, barely a word of English spoken. Ordered bolognese cutlet (huge, so much cheese), seafood pasta (generous toppings and delicious), tortellini in broth. Good valued food. 

Wandering around the Centro some more, checked the sette chiese and San Petronio. Wanted to go to teatro anatomical, but it was closed today. Wasnt sure where to eat dinner, so we just went back to Sfogline Rina as we liked it. Ordered the lasanga, tortellini in parm and egg sauce, and tortelli special. All delicious. 

Day 5:
Checked out at 9am, went to Cafe Montebello for coffee while we waiting for the train. Arrived at station 40minute beforehand, and headed down to the highspeed platforms. i booked the tickets a month ago for a big discount, but no flexibility. 

TLDR: Bologna is amazing, food is great, its a place to live, not visit. 

Next stop, Florence for three days! Any recommendations for food and sights? 

Planning for:
Duomo Bell Tower and Dome
Accademia Gallery
possible daytrip to Siena
Galileo museum (more into science than arts, hence not Uffuzi)

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 8, 2136*

I strolled into the music cafe in White Hill, buffeted by a gust of air that ruffled my black wool as it carried the taste of fresh pastries and coffee roast. The quaint little place hummed with the chatter of students and academics and a gentle melody played over the speakers underscored by the occasional clink of cups. My friends trailed behind me—Vemly with her distinctive white wool and that beautiful black splotch, Reuki's reddish-brown fur almost glowing in the soft light, and Colton, finally maskless.

""Kila!"" I called out cheerfully, spotting our new friend, tucked away in a corner booth with her snout buried in her pad. ""We've got all the bits and bobs for Colton's guitar, now. We were thinking today's a fine day to put it together in your workshop, what do you say?""

Kila looked up, her expression a mix of amusement and exasperation. ""Anaw, right? I'd love to help, but only engineering students can use the facilities. Besides, I already told you, I'm swamped as it is. We can't bump you to the front of the line.""

Before the disappointment could settle on my face, Vemly took Colton’s box and slid into the bench across from Kila with a confidence that made her wool seem to shine even more. ""I think we have something that'll make you reconsider."" She glanced at me, then at Colton, before opening the box and presenting its contents to Kila.

Kila leaned forward, her eyes narrowing with curiosity. ""What’re these then?""

""They're human guitar pickups,"" Vemly admitted, her confidence deflating just a tad. ""The kind you've been trying to figure out.""

Colton leaned in, his finger pointing to each pickup as he explained the nuances of their design. ""Thought you might like to take a peek at these. Maybe reverse-engineer them for your own projects?""

As he spoke, Kila's demeanor transformed. Her tail wagged like a metronome set to an upbeat tempo, her attention wholly captured by the box’s treasures. ""These are incredible,"" she breathed, each word laced with wonder as she inspected the pickups, her engineer's mind already dissecting the craftsmanship.

""See? Told you she'd want 'em,"" Vemly whispered, her tail nudging me playfully; I couldn't help wagging my own. Leave it to Vemly to turn the harvest in our favor with just a flick of her ear.

Kila's composure returned as she straightened up, her eyes locking onto Colton with a professionalism that belied the excitement I'd just seen. ""Reverse engineering these will take time,"" she said, her voice steady. ""And I'll have to take some apart to see how they are made. You understand?""

Vemly clutched the box protectively, and there was a glint of determination in her eyes. ""We're willing to give you all these pickups—except for the one Colton needs—if you help us out today. Build his guitar with us."" She glanced at me, seeking silent support.

""Today?"" Kila's tail bobbed in thought, her ears twitching erratically. ""The workshop is booked solid for the next two claws by students working on their propulsion projects. But..."" She paused, considering. ""I could sneak you in during fifth claw, Just not Colton. The university hasn't recruited any human engineering students yet.""

""Fifth claw, then!"" Colton blurted out before any of us could protest. He reached across the table, offering a hand and a grateful smile. ""Thank you, Kila. Really.""

""Alright, let's get to it."" Kila was all business now as she shook Colton’s hand and turned to us. ""What do we need to put together this masterpiece of yours?""

Reuki, who had been fidgeting beside me, perked up at the question and quickly dug into his bag to retrieve a stack of folded papers. With hesitant claws, he unfolded the lot and handed them over; the diagrams he and Colton had worked on — a detailed blueprint of the guitar’s parts, each line drawn with careful precision.

""Wow,"" Kila said with genuine appreciation, her gaze tracing the shapes on the paper. ""These are really well done.""

A light shade of green crept into Reuki's cheeks, and he ducked his head, trying to hide the pleased smile that tugged at his lips as his fur bristled with embarrassment and pride.

""Reuki here has the hands of a master craftsman."" I chimed in, eager to bolster my friend's confidence. ""He's an artist with wood.""

""Absolutely!"" Vemly added, her tail signing her agreement, a visual punctuation mark to our chorus of praise.

Colton nodded vigorously, a gesture of respect that seemed to deepen the color in Reuki's cheeks to a dark, forest green.

""Okay, give me until next paw to gather what we need,"" Kila said, the diagrams still in hand as she stood up from the booth. ""Follow the university map and meet me outside the dorms at second claw.""

In a flash, she was out the door. An anticipation bubbled within me—tomorrow, we would be taking a huge step towards actually putting a band together!

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 8, 2136*

When we met Kila outside the dorms she turned her head to look around furtively before handing us each a box, in addition to the box of guitar parts Colton had given us. I still hadn’t asked him how his meeting had gone. Obviously it hadn’t gone as planned, he only came back with a box of parts but he had also been acting strangely. Well, strange for him at least. 

""Act natural,"" she whispered, her eyes darting to and fro as if expecting hidden observers in the shadows of White Hill's sleepy streets.

""Got it, tree mode,"" I joked, trying to lighten the mood as we followed her brisk pace toward the university's engineering building. The modern structure loomed ahead, its sleek design a stark contrast to the quaintness of the Library.

Inside, the workshop was a cavernous space, brimming with machines big and small and all looking very complicated. Only a lone gojid, lost in his work at one of the milling machines, occupied the room. His quills shivered in concentration, oblivious to our entry.

""Put the boxes down here and open them — quickly!"" Kila instructed, pointing to a sturdy table laden with tools. There was an urgency in her voice that made my wool stand on end. She saw the concern in my tail, ""You're not supposed to be here, and if we get caught, I'm in deep trouble.""

Unpacking my box felt like unwrapping gifts at the turn of the season—out came sheets of sandpaper, a sander, a glossy bottle of finish coating, and a snug nest of electronic components. Vemly beside me carefully extracted two large bottles, measuring cups, and stirring sticks, arranging them with precision. Reuki, meanwhile, freed a long piece of wood and a bag filled with the metallic chorus of hardware.

""Reuki, take this and start on the neck,"" Kila commanded, handing him the diagram that he and Colton had poured their hearts into. Her tail pointed to a bench covered in what I assumed were woodworking tools as she turned to check on the gojid's progress.

""Sure thing,"" Reuki murmured, his earlier blush replaced by the focused pallor of determination. He moved to the bench, his paw clutching the paper like a sacred text.

""Remember, don't touch anything else,"" Kila reminded us sternly, her gaze sweeping over the equipment like a protective parent. ""I mean it.""

""Wouldn't dream of it,"" I replied, though my insides churned with the thrill of being where we clearly didn't belong. 

This was more than mere mischief; it was a secret mission, a covert operation to bring a friend's vision to life. And despite the risk, it felt exhilarating!

""Anaw, open those up and start sorting,"" Kila ordered while pointing to the bag of electronics, her words carrying that tone of someone who knew exactly what needed doing. 

""Vemly, you're on mixing duty. Equal parts of each. Measure but don’t mix until I tell you.""

""Got it,"" Vemly replied with a nod, her white wool bobbing as she measured out the chemicals with a practiced eye while Kila went to retrieve something from a machine.

I watched for a second, admiring the rhythm of her work—scoop, pour, measure—before turning back to my own task: separate the electronics. Wires, resistors, LEDs, controller, and battery housing… simple enough.

""Now, Vemly, combine them in the big cup and add five drops of black dye. **Five** drops, no more, no less,"" Kila instructed, returning with a mold that had the distinct shape of Colton's guitar. 

She set the mold down beside an array of other printed pieces that looked like they belonged in a complicated jigsaw puzzle.

""Five drops,"" Vemly echoed, her tail swishing with concentration as she added the small black bottle's contents to the mixture, turning the clear liquid into a terrifying, dark abyss. Not my preference but from what Colton has shown me of his music, he’ll probably love it.

""Alright, Anaw,"" Kila said, holding out a sheet of paper to me, ""these are your instructions.""

I took the blueprints, quickly scanning the lines. Lights, wires, microcontroller with a battery for power—it all seemed straightforward enough. 

""Thanks, Kila, I think I've got this,"" I said, flicking a confident ear her way.

""Good,"" her tail gave a single, approving sweep. 

Kila then joined Vemly at the mold, their movements synchronized in a dance of creation as they poured the thick black resin. The acrid taste of chemicals filled my mouth. I soldered the last connection just as they completed the resin pour, watching it settle like a dark sea under a moonless night. It was the start of… something! I could feel it in my bones!

""Hey, Anaw, what are these electronics for anyway?"" Vemly's curious voice drifted over as I connected wires with a focused intensity.

""Colton wants the guitar to..."" I started, but paused as Kila hurried away, her attention snagged by Reuki's encounter with the gojid.

""Colton's got this wild idea,"" I murmured to Vemly, watching Kila patiently explain something to the gojid who had ambled over to Reuki. Their ears seemed to quiver with curiosity. 

""He wants the guitar to light up like a fire, you know, all warm and glowing.""

""Really?"" Vemly's ear perked up; her tail waved slowly as if contemplating something. “I’d have thought he wouldn’t want to have anything like fire near his guitar after what happened to it last time.”

I curled my tail in confusion and flicked my ears in agreement. “You’d think.”

The gojid excitedly tapped their claws together in apparent approval of whatever kila had said, making a sound like gentle rain on a tin roof.

""Seems like it's going well over there,"" Vemly commented, her gaze following the gojid's retreat back to his work.

""Rupen's all good,"" Kila announced, returning with that focused look people get when they’re juggling twelve tasks in their head. She poked at the resin, which remained motionless under her prodding claw.

""He'll keep quiet about us being here, as long as he gets to help with the pickups later.""

""Fair trade,"" I said with a nod, happy to hear we wouldn’t have to deal with any unwanted attention.

""Alright, Anaw."" Kila pointed to the solidified mass in the mold. ""Time for the light show."" 

I peeled off a strip of double-sided tape and pressed the microcontroller’s port and the battery housing snug against the inner wall, then arranged the tiny lights across the surface. They looked like little stars waiting for nightfall.

""Next batch coming up!"" Vemly sang out, already mixing another clear concoction with Kila's guidance. 

The air was filled with the sharp taste of chemicals, but beneath it, there was the excitement of creation, almost tangible.

""Here,"" Kila handed me a couple of small bottles, red and yellow. ""Add a few drops on top, more yellow than red; maybe two to one.""

The red and yellow danced together as I added drops across the surface, creating fiery patterns as Vemly and Kila mixed the colors.

""Okay, now stop,"" Kila ordered after a few seconds, and I pulled back, watching as they carefully mixed the colors until the resin was noticeably less viscous.

“Now for the ashes.” 

Kila handed Vemly the picture of how the ashes should be spread. Vemly and I sprinkled the ashes over the swirled surface, following the picture Colton had drawn. His design was like some sort of bird with its wings stretched out, a symbol of some sort I’d have to ask him about.

""Good,"" Kila whispered, as she prepared the final layer of clear resin. 

Pouring it gently, she sealed our efforts with a practiced hand, ensuring that every speck of ash and every whisper of light was captured within the instrument.

""Is it supposed to look that mesmerizing?"" Vemly asked, her voice hushed as we all stood back to admire the still liquid canvas.

""Let's hope Colton thinks so,"" I replied, unable to take my eyes off the mold. It felt like this was more than just an object we were crafting—it was something important, almost sacred.

""Give it time to cure,"" Kila instructed, wiping her hands on a rag. ""And then, we'll see if our efforts have truly paid off.""

**\[Advance Memory Transcript by Time Unit: 0.5 Hours\]**

With the final layer of resin cured and solid, we stood before our creation with a collective breath held in anticipation. Kila's deft fingers worked to pry the guitar free from its mold—a moment that felt like an eternity until finally, it came loose with a soft pop. There it was, the body of Colton's guitar, gleaming under the workshop lights, an intricate dance of color and light encased within its curves.

""Next step,"" Kila said, her tail swaying with quiet triumph as she handed me the prepared sander.

After my arms felt like they would fall off from holding the sander, Kila declared she would make holes for mounting the remaining parts.

My heart pounded like a drum as she lined up the tool, following the precise indicators Reuki had marked. The whir of the drill punctuated the air, each hole another small victory in our covert operation. Reuki watched, his eyes shining with joy as the pieces Colton had provided us—a bridge here, a tuning peg there—began to find their homes amidst the guitar's form.

""Almost there,"" I murmured, my hands steady despite the flutter in my chest. Assembling the parts felt like piecing together a puzzle destined to sing—the strings stretched and tuned, the neck bolted firmly in place.

""Let's see if we made magic or just a very pretty mistake,"" Kila chuckled, her humor a welcome breeze in the thick tension of the room. 

She fitted a tiny battery into its compartment and flicked a switch. A soft glow emanated from the guitar's body, pulsing gently like the heartbeat of a star. Our faces, Venlil and Yotul alike, were illuminated by the same ethereal light, reflecting the wonder in our eyes.

""Beautiful,"" Reuki breathed out, his voice tinged with awe.

""More than beautiful,"" I corrected with a grin. ""It's perfect.""

Kila plucked a string, and the sound reverberated through the workshop, pure and clear. Her ears perked up, and a satisfied nod followed. 

""It's all working. Just remember, not a word about today, okay?""

""On our honor,"" Vemly replied, placing a paw over her chest.

""Thank you for everything, Kila,"" I sighed, feeling a swell of gratitude for our friend who'd risked so much to help us.

""Give Colton my thanks for the pickups,"" she added, her gaze lingering on the instrument. ""Now go, before anyone comes.""

We made our way back to where Colton waited, the clandestine air of our mission lingering with every step. As the White Hill music cafe came into view, I could feel the weight of the guitar in my hands—not just in physical heft but in the emotional significance it carried.

""Colton!"" Vemly called out as we approached, her voice bright and eager.

When he saw us, his eyes widened, and then, as they settled on the guitar, they glistened with unshed tears. Without a word, he reached out, taking the guitar into his arms like he might cradle a newborn. He ran his fingers over the strings, the glowing body, the fiery ashes sealed within, and then, unable to contain the emotion welling inside him, Colton pulled each of us into a tight embrace.

""Perfect,"" he whispered, his voice breaking. ""It's absolutely perfect.""",1,1730584735.0,NatureofPredators,0,1.0,False

1gi7ggy,https://www.reddit.com/r/KneeMassageTherapy/comments/1gi7ggy/grasping_the_whole_deal_with_knee_massagers_their/,Grasping the Whole Deal with Knee Massagers: Their Essence and Operation?,"So, knee massagers—what’s the deal? These gadgets are crafted to zero in on that nagging knee pain and annoying stiffness. Most of 'em mash up different therapies like warmth, shaking, and air squeezes, giving you a kinda peaceful massage experience. They're usually pretty small, easy to carry around, and hassle-free to operate, which makes them a hit among folks wanting to ditch meds or invasive stuff for knee relief. Oh, and let’s not forget the roller massagers—they’re like the unsung heroes in the recovery game, helping out with muscle relaxation and all that jazz.

### What You’ll Typically Find in a Knee Massager

1.  **Heat Therapy**: Plays around with boosting blood flow, which might dial down inflammation and kickstart healing.
2.  **Vibration**: Helps ease pain and tightness by loosening up those knotty muscles near your knee.
3.  **Air Compression**: Supports better circulation and cuts down swelling, which is handy if you’re dealing with arthritis-like conditions.
4.  **Roller Mechanisms**: Especially in roller massagers, these help in enhancing recovery by improving range of motion and muscular performance. Imagine a car’s suspension system but for your knee—kind of neat, right?

### Do Knee Massagers Actually Work?

Whether knee massagers hit the mark or not depends a lot on what's causing your knee pain in the first place. They might not be a silver bullet for everyone, but a bunch of users say they feel a big difference, especially if it’s muscle tightness, mild arthritis, or just being stiff from too much running around. Let’s dig into what they’re good for and where they might fall short—plus, throw in some cool research findings while we're at it.

#### The Upsides of Knee Massagers

1.  **Boosted Blood Flow** Tossing some heat into the mix, these massagers can get the blood moving better around your knee. This is kinda great for those with arthritis or other stuff that slows down blood flow because more blood can mean less swelling and better healing. And hey, there’s science backing this up! A study showed that just 20 seconds of applying a roller massager to your quads can boost your knee’s range of motion by 10%. Hold on, it gets better—60 seconds can push that up to 16%. Not too shabby, huh? (Bradbury-Squires et al., 2015; Cavanaugh, 2016)
2.  **Pain Relief with a Bit of Shake and Squeeze** Vibration and air pressure can help let go of muscle tension and shrink swelling. The shaking might trick your brain into paying less attention to the pain—kind of like a distraction. The squeeze gives your knee some support and can dial down swelling pretty fast. Plus, roller massagers aren’t just about feeling good—they’ve been shown to reduce pain and even improve neuromuscular efficiency during activities like lunges. Who knew your knee could get smarter? (Bradbury-Squires et al., 2015)
3.  **Less Stiffness, More Moving Around** If your joints feel like they're stuck in place, these massagers can gently move things around to keep them flexible. This can be a lifesaver for folks with knee osteoarthritis, helping them get a bit more movement back in their knees. In older adults who’ve had total knee arthroplasty (TKA), roller massagers have been shown to up knee flexion ROM and cut down pain. Imagine waking up one day with knees that feel a bit more sprightly—pretty awesome. (Yokochi et al., 2023)

#### What’s Not So Great About Knee Massagers

1.  **They’re Not a Magic Fix** Sure, knee massagers can take the edge off pain and stiffness, but they're no replacement for fixing bigger issues like torn ligaments or serious arthritis. Think of them more like a sidekick rather than the main hero. They shine when used alongside other treatments, not on their own.
2.  **Relief Might Be Short-Lived** Some people find that the comfort from a knee massager doesn’t stick around for long. If you’re battling chronic pain or really bad joints, you might need something more involved, like physical therapy or meds. It’s kinda like that quick coffee hug you get in the morning—it wakes you up but doesn’t fix all your problems.
3.  **Not for Every Situation** If you’ve recently had knee surgery or have a fresh injury, using a knee massager could do more harm than good. Best to check with a doctor before jumping into the knee massager game if your knee situation is serious. Plus, interestingly, foam rolling those quads can sometimes mess with your hamstrings—maybe because it’s a bit too much of a good thing? (Cavanaugh, 2016)

### Common Questions People Have About Knee Massagers

**1. Can a Knee Massager Do the Job of Physical Therapy?** Nah, knee massagers shouldn’t take the place of physical therapy, but they can play nice alongside it. Physical therapists might suggest a knee massager as part of a bigger plan that includes workouts, stretches, and maybe some changes in your daily habits.

**2. How Often Should I Be Using a Knee Massager?** Most pros say kick things off with sessions lasting about 10-15 minutes once or twice a day. If your body likes it and you’re sensing more relief, you can slowly bump up how often you use it. Just don’t overdo it—your knees might thank you for the chill time.

**3. Do These Devices Ease Arthritis Pain?** A lot of people with arthritis swear by knee massagers, especially those that have heat and compression features. These can knock down joint pain and help you move more easily, making everyday tasks less of a hassle.

**4. Any Bad Side Effects I Should Worry About?** Generally, they're safe, but some folks might get skin irritation from using them too long or feel uncomfortable if the device is too tight. Always stick to the manufacturer’s guidelines and tweak the intensity to what feels right for you.

**5. How’s a Knee Massager Different from a Knee Brace?** A knee brace is all about giving structural support, often used to keep the knee stable after an injury. Knee massagers, meanwhile, are more about chilling out your knee and easing pain through heat, shaking, and squeezing.

### When Do Knee Massagers Do Their Best?

Looking at what users are saying and some clinical bits, knee massagers shine under certain kinds of pain, like:

*   **After-Workout Muscle Ache**: The calming vibes from a knee massager can ease those post-exercise sore muscles, helping you bounce back quicker.
*   **Early Arthritis Stages**: If you're in the early days of arthritis, these massagers can help manage the symptoms by making your joints more flexible and cutting down stiffness.
*   **General Knee Nuisances**: Got the occasional knee pain from standing or sitting too long? Knee massagers can give you quick and easy relief. Plus, for older adults who’ve had knee surgery, they can seriously up the game in recovery. (Yokochi et al., 2023)

### What Do the Numbers Show? Stats and Studies

Research hints that heat therapy on its own can bump up blood flow by around 20%, which helps cut down swelling and get things healing. On top of that, when you throw in vibration and sometimes squeezing in knee massagers, users have reported their pain feeling about 30% to 40% less over time. And let’s not forget those roller massagers—applying one to your quads for just 20 seconds can boost your knee’s ROM by 10%, and go up to 16% with 60 seconds. Plus, they help reduce pain and improve how your muscles work during activities like lunges. Talk about multitasking! (Bradbury-Squires et al., 2015; Cavanaugh, 2016; Yokochi et al., 2023)

Though there's not a wealth of studies focused just on knee massagers, these broader pain-relief stats suggest that gadgets combining heat, compression, and vibration can really help manage knee pain and discomfort.

### Wrapping It Up

Knee massagers come across as a non-invasive and wallet-friendly way to soothe knee pain, making them a tempting pick for many. They’re not a cure-all for every knee problem, but for minor discomforts, stiffness, and tension, they do a solid job. If you’re dealing with mild to moderate knee pain, a knee massager might just be what you need. Just remember, they’re best used as part of a well-rounded approach to managing pain—so mixing them up with exercising, stretching, and keeping a healthy lifestyle can get you the best outcomes. And hey, a little research-backed magic never hurts when your knees are complaining!

1gi7apk,https://i.redd.it/kc1ab9am6kyd1.jpeg,Flee - L Corp Welfare Captain (FunnyMan lore post),"*Flee walked down the halls of Lobotomy Corporation, having recently been promoted to the captain of the Welfare Department.* 

""Huh, who knew a low life city dweller like me would end up in this position?"" 

*The hallways were empty and cold, as they usually were. Of course, it was a facility filled with inhuman beings that constantly put the employees lives at the stake, so maybe the cold and quiet feeling wasn't all that bad.* 

""This certainly isn't the best job, but so far I-"" 

*Before Flee had the chance to finish his inner monologue, the trumpets went off. Thankfully for him, it was just a first trumpet, meaning that it was likely just a simple problem that was easily able to be taken care of.* 

*Flee didn't think much of it, that was until he heard the voice of a familiar emotionless AI that he didn't feel quite positive about coming from the speaker on the ceiling.* 

""Welfare Captain Agent 32, the Manager has ordered that you move down to the Extraction Department in order to supress and abnormality."" 

*Flee lets out an annoyed sigh, he hated that the AI, Angela, would always act like she was better than everyone. It pissed him off, yet as a simple agent he couldn't do anything but to listen to the orders given.* 

""This job sure as hell likes to treat me like shit... Chesed better give me some real fucking good coffee after this."" 

*By the time Flee reaches the Extraction Department, something rather suprising revealed to have gone down.* 

*Flee found an abnormality screeching in pain and letting out horrific ear piercing noise as a girl, laughing and smiling like a maniac, stabbed it over and over with what looks to be the Fragments from Somewhere E.G.O weapon.* 

*Flee was confused and off put by the girl but quickly took the Magic Bullet E.G.O weapon from his back, lined up a shot, and fired at the abnormalities head. The abnormality was taken out by the bullet penetrating its head which suppressed it, the first trumpet scenario was taken care of.* 

""Who the hell is this girl...?"" 

*The girl quickly sprinted up to Flee with an optimistic yet almost disturbing smile on her face. Flee was caught off guard and visibly a bit weirded out by the odd girl, though he was also clearly a bit happy to see someone who wasn't depressed or suicidal working in the facility.*

1gi6yvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gi6yvt/breville_barista_express_upgrade_recommendation/,Breville Barista Express Upgrade recommendation [$1000],"Hello Coffee Aficionados,

My Breville Barista Express (BBE) broke after over 5 years of use, and I’m in the market for a new espresso machine. We generally drink 4-5 cups of flat whites/ lattes daily, and the occasional espresso or Americano, and prefer to use medium-roast beans.

I’m looking for a new machine in the USD 1000-1400 price range. Any recommendations in this price range would be greatly appreciated.

Requirements:
1. Compact — countertop space is a real issue
2. Integrated grinder - I would prefer a minimalistic design, but also because of [1]. I can be convinced otherwise, but the espresso machine & grinder should still be within the above budget
3. PID, temperature control
4. Fast heat-up times - similar to BBE would work just fine < 3 min
5. high quality, durability
6. wouldn’t prefer something that only has manual extraction
7. hot water spout
8. auto purge, auto clean group head
9. good support, widely available accessories

Nice to have
1. Boiler + thermoblock for fast heat-up of the steam unit
2. integrated scales
3. volumetric extraction 

The Meraki comes close to checking most of the above boxes, but I’m concerned about its durability and support model (or lack thereof).

Thanks for your help!

- Power my 220v airfryer (1500w) and coffee maker from the house bank, when I’m on the hook. Every once in a while I’ll use some other appliances too, but the airfryer is the most powerful one. 

-Charge the starter battery and the bow thruster battery from the house batteries when I leave the boat for long periods of time, without being hooked up to shore power. 

I already have a shore charger which is hooked up to all three batteries and I also have a bunch of 220v sockets that I use when I’m in the marina

He asked what I was looking for in dating. I told him that I wanted to be friends first and then if anything romantic develops then great.

He is from Europe and I'm from the US so maybe it's a cultural difference, but he insisted our next date (or 1st date actually since this one was just a meet and greet) must take place somewhere private and include some physical contact (not necessarily full blown sex).

Surprisingly I did actually like him well enough, but his wanting to map this out in addition to his wanting to make sure we were aligned in other respects -like whether either of us ever wanted to marry again, whether we were both financially independent, where I specifically wanted to travel in the future, plus politics of course - all important topics, but a lot for a 1st time coffee date.

He said he'd dated a woman for a long time and then found out they were sexually incompatible. I honestly don't think he was just after sex. We talked a long time and he did seem to sincerely want a relationship.

To me though, he sounded like so many young men on Reddit who don't want to ""waste"" their time dating a while and then finding out they are not sympatico sexually. They sound like they really feel they've been taken advantage of when that happens.

To me at age 60 that seems absurd. I'm not too concerned about being friend zoned. If I get ""friend zoned"" I'll either be friends with the person and look for romance elsewhere or nix the person as friend.

Now for background 
Recently over this Halloween holiday my younger sister ""Tina"" had a friend stay over the night of Halloween and slept over till this afternoon when her friend left. (to note my mom is has also been sick with a cold since Halloween)

Now to the story and issue at hand 
I (17 m) do most if not all of the cleaning in our household, when my mom doesn't have the time to do so. This includes washing dishes,  taking out the trash, emptying out and cleaning the fridge occasionally (every 3 weeks) cleaning the bathroom and cleaning the living room. I do not mind doing such, however the problem arises when I'm shouldered to clean messes that I didn't make. 
 As mentioned in the background I provide my sister had a friend over for the past 2 days, I didn't really mind that but the kid did over stay their welcome but hey not my monkey not my circus. Besides that,  I was out all day yesterday till I got home at 7 and the house was a pigsty to the front area to the kitchen and living room. Trash and crap everywhere, alas I kept quite and did some dishes before tending to other things. I just hoped and prayed my dad would tell the two girls to clean up the messes hoping I wouldn't be expected to clean up after them considering the girls and damn well old enough to clean up after themselves. I wake up this morning to make my coffee and I am greeted to the same mess, I went to sleep with nothing has been touched. If anything more of a mess was made looked like a tornado just came though. I once again just kept quiet and decide to make my coffee have some food and watch a video, hoping once again that the mess would be gone. By this time it was roughly 12 and My sisters friend wasn't gone so I asked my sister where Carla's mom is (I was told her mom would pick her up by 11) My sister got mad saying that it's not her issue and that we can just drop Carla off. I told my sister we can NOT because my dad was busy and I can't drive and my mom was as sick as a dog. My sister on the brink of a fit sits down and the two play more, making more of a mess. It was 12 by this time so I ask them to start cleaning up gently because Carla's mom was sure to be on the way. My sister yells at me saying that she will but I know very well I'd end up cleaning it up. A few minutes pass and Carla gets a text that her mom is here so she leaves. I tell my sister that the mess better be clean by 1. she says whatever snipy thing back. I ignore it and start doing another round of dishes because God knows no one else will. For every 10 minutes that pass I remind her to clean up the mess, and surprisingly she doesn't do it. By the 4th reminder I was pissed and I started yelled at her and she just kept sitting playing whatever game. I gave up told my dad he didn't do anything. I admit what I did was rash but I was fed up. I grabbed everything near her that she didn't pick up and dumped it on her (it was just pillows stuffys and candy wrappers, nothing that would actually hurt her.) My sister yells gets my dad and all of a sudden it's a big deal. My dad yells at me and I rip him a new one telling I've done more shit for this house than he ever has, calling him a man child and useless for never cleaning a dish or ever tidying up or for never listening or doing anything useless i yell.

I feel dumb, its probably a simple answer, but after searching online, I am at a loss and Im wondering if someone has had a similar thought and has an answer. 

Kingrinder states that for each click of the K6, there is a change of 16 microns. The K6 has 60 clicks per round. So logically, one round would be 960 microns (60\*16). However, when I look at the [Honest Coffee Scale ](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/coffee-grind-size-chart/)for the K6, one round, or 60 clicks, sits around \~500 microns. 

Looking elsewhere, pour overs should use a micron size range of 400-960 microns. But the K6 states pour overs should be anywhere from 90-120 clicks, which would be 1440-1920 microns using the 16 microns per click.  

Why such a discrepancy? 

Sorry if this is dumb. I know its rather insignificant, as the coffee I have been brewing has been great. Its just this has been on my mind for a few days.

Then towards the end, she asked if I could speak Thai, after which I said Yes, but not too good. So she 'tested' me by having a little convo in Thai. Things were okay, but the whole time, I was struggling to use the right vocab, and the biggest dilemma in my head was ""How do I address her?"", so I just kinda intentionally skipped that thing while talking to her, so it was sorta an incomplete sentence lol.

I am 30, she's about late 50s -- so much older than I am. She addressed herself as ""Chan: ฉัน"" and dropped ""Pii: พี่"" here and there. So next time, should I be calling her ""Khun Pii: คุณพี่ (Her name)"" or ""Pii - (Her name)"" or ""either of those alone, without her name""?

This year, we finally saved enough to plan an amazing trip to my home country, where she could meet my family and see where I grew up. We spent six months planning it and were excited.

The trip was a tour of several cities, visiting family and exploring. Things went well until the last city, where I planned to meet my dad (who raised me after my parents divorced) and some aunts. My wife mentioned she had a friend in town she might see, and I was fine with that. But when we arrived, she got sick and felt terrible, so she wanted to stay in bed and insisted I go see my family without her. I stayed with her for a bit, got her food, and told her to reach out if she needed anything. I visited some friends and later returned to the Airbnb that night.

The next day, she was still unwell, and again urged me to go meet family. I had lunch with my aunt, who was asking me about my wife and even suggested medicine for her when I told her she was sick. After lunch I told my aunt I was going back to the Airbnb to check on my wife, and on my way there I texted her asking how she was feeling to which she replied she was still very sick and with a massive headache. She told me to stay out, to go and enjoy my time in the city, so I decided to walk around my old neighborhood and eventually met up with my dad at a mall. That’s when my wife texted, saying that her friend had texted her saying he wanted to meet up with her and go grab a coffee, and she pretty much said that since her friend lives in Florida and now they happened to be in the same city she did not want to lose on the opportunity, this happened around 5 p.m. I was surprised but told her okay. I was with my dad until 11 p.m. and then I went back to the Airbnb. She was not there yet when I arrived and ended up coming back at around 1 a.m.

On our last day, my family invited us to breakfast. I got ready early, and my wife suddenly felt better and wanted to join. I told her it felt too late—she had chosen not to meet them before, so I went alone. Throughout the day, she blew up my phone, accusing me of cheating, and claiming that my behavior meant I must’ve reconnected with an ex or met someone. She didn’t seem to consider that while she was too sick to meet my family, she was fine meeting her friend. I lied to my family the last day saying that my wife was still sick and, that she was not going to meet them when she was feeling better, so  AITA?",8,1730582486.0,AmItheAsshole,12,1.0,False

So right now i grind before bed and set the brewer to go off in the morning. Of course I lose freshness with this, but it is really pleasant to just have the coffee there and I value that. 

But I want to upgrade, and I am split between:

1) Getting the Xbloom studio 

2)  Getting a new grinder (e.g fellow ode 2) and the Aiden Brewer.

3) Just keeping the sage precision brewer(as it is a tank and i respect it)and getting a much better grinder like a Niche or something. 

I drink almost exclusively light roast coffee, often ethopian in style.

The Xbloom seems like the most obvious option but there seems to be some negative reviews, and people generally seem to value the Aiden more, and suggest that it has better long term potential in terms of receipes etc. Does anyone have any thoughts, or experiences, and what do you guys think is the best option for my particular case.

I am creating this topic to find some suitable advice and savvy people who can help to sort things out. Will be glad to receive any piece of useful advice.

1. So, about me: Male, single, 32 y.o. Living abroad now (in Warsaw) and receive a 1k USD scholarship till July next year.

My spending:

\- $700 for apartment rent with all utilities (very good price for studio-apartment in the central part of city, I would never change it to a dormitory or rent another place with other people to save money, I prefer living alone).

\- $200 monthly for food (October was the first month where I spent $200 for everything needed. I was eating well and already bought some huge packs of spaghetti, rice, olive oil etc - everything that might be used for months. Also, I cook at home 95% of time to avoid wasting money). So $200 for food without losing nutrition quality.

\- my transport card is covered by the scholarship.

\- and around $100 left is what I have left for savings.

2. Also, I have approximately counted my other expenses (around $250-300 monthly) - I go out because I like to socialize and meet with friends to grab a beer or two. Sometimes I go outside the city by train, so I buy tickets. Sometimes I might have unexpected costs, like having a coffee with someone. But, usually, I try to save when I can and don't make emotional buys of coffee/kebabs or smth like that. 95% of the time I buy what I really need or spend money when it makes sense.

3. I have around $1200 of savings in my bank account and around $1k in crypto.

4. Last 6 years I've been working as a freelancer in internet marketing, and I am well familiar with my field. Unfortunately, this doesn't give me money for the last year or so, because the freelance platform I've been working became real shit for freelancers. I have a stellar profile there with over 100 jobs finished but struggle finding projects there, because no one even opens my bids.

So, it turns out that I don't have any additional cash flow right now (however, I will continue bidding anyways) and my scholarship doesn't cover all my expenses. I can't get a job, because it is prohibited by contract, and the best way is to earn money by freelance, but it doesn't work.

Also, I don't want to continue working in the IT field and plan to change my specialty completely.

5. I am searching for some real advice of what I can do now to improve my financial situation, how to add new ways of earning some money, and how to act for the long-term perspective. Some savings advices are also appreciated.

I have plenty of free time, like 4 days a week.

Thank you!

P.S. I don't want to live from paycheck to paycheck. I want to create a cash flow, increase my savings and maybe buy a car in the future.",1,1730581741.0,povertyfinance,1,1.0,False

1gi6c36,https://www.reddit.com/r/nofriends/comments/1gi6c36/surface_level_friendships/,Surface level friendships. ,"Growing up and being in college I had lots of friends and was in a few friend groups and was always really social. But as I’ve grown up and left these environments somehow I lost contact with everyone. I don’t even know how I did this. 

I like my own company and I feel like I’m definitely a “low maintenance” type of friend - as in if one of my old friends who I’ve not spoken to for years hit me up right now and said hey wanna go for coffee, I’d say yes as if no time had passed since we last spoke. 

So in a way I guess it’s my own fault for not maintaining these friendships. And the problem is friends I’ve made recently already have better friends. 

As in, yes they’re friendly to me, we have chats, we have coffee it’s nice. But it’s all surface level. They have better friends. They have best friends they’re super close with and have known for years so why would they become besties with me? 

I just have a couple surface level friendships and I miss having close friends I guess. But even when I did I’d feel overwhelmed by constantly having to be there for them (by constantly I mean my old best friend who I miss dearly, would face time me everyday expect to hang out all the time when I just had no time). It was hard to keep up with them when I like my own company too. Idk. I miss having a bestie ",4,1730581301.0,nofriends,1,1.0,False
1gi6auu,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1gi6auu/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

♤ I watch Let's Plays on YouTube and love the RE games, Bloodborne, and Chillas Art games (go check them out) but once again, I've never actually played them since I don't have a gaming console.
♡ I like cottagecore, witch core, and tarrot cards (I would like to actually tell fortunes one day) 
☆ When it comes to school, I'm double majoring in business and plan to open up my own someday.. maybe a coffee shop of sorts ☕️

I was a year after a breakup from an abusive relationship. We immediately hit it off and spent 5(ish) months ""dating"". Never really labeling it. In November she confessed that she had feelings for me, and would like to build something serious, and long-lasting with me. I wasn't in my right mind back then, I was scared of committing, and getting that close to someone due to past trauma.  
I've acted incredibly immaturely, instead of talking it through I started to distance her, and later treat her badly verbally.  
In December she decided that she didn't want to keep in contact with me. She said the fact that I won't commit to her hurts her as much as my abusive behavior towards her. She asked me to never talk to her again.  
And so I did. I knew that I screwed up, I wasn't fair or humane. I felt awful about myself.   
I did not contact her, I just let her go.

A lot has changed in the next 7 months of my life, I went to therapy, I've worked a ton on myself, and I became a better person in every single aspect of life I can think of. I started to feel confident and good about myself.  
She never left my mind though, I never really planned on changing what happened, but I lived by scenarios in which we meet by accident.  
August 2024, a concert of the same band that I was attending, just because I like them. Curiosity got better of me and I messaged her about it. Turned out she was going too, I offered a coffee which she agreed to.  
That day went so weirdly flawlessly. It was like no time had passed and nothing had ever happened between us. We spent a night together, and it got a bit out of ""control"". We were meeting each other regularly again, and we decided to take a week long trip to another country.  
We talked a lot about what happened during that time, I confessed and explained everything to her. I've tried to be as see-through as possible. I even told her that I'm ready for a relationship if that was ever about to happen.  
On the last night of our trip, she told me that she loved me. Incredibly deeply that is, and that she never stopped loving me. But she can't imagine having me in her life. She can't feel fully safe next to me, even tho she forgives me, she can't unsee the abuse. She told me she doesn't want to ever be in a relationship with me, because she won't be able to see past our past.  
When we were saying goodbye at the train station she was sobbing, so loudly I don't think I've ever seen anything like that. Constantly screaming that she does in fact love me.   
That was September 15th. For the rest of September, I've been trying to contact her. She never replied to any of my messages, nor she ever picked up a phone. I sent her a DIY present box for her birthday at October first, with a short letter. She did not react what so ever. After that, I did not try to contact her. It's November 2nd,  and I just don't know what realistically I should do.  
I don't know if she needs time, or is it really over and I should let her go once again. Part of me thinks that I should try to force myself into her life cause she needs reassurance etc, but part of me says ""if she wanted to, she would"". 

Is there anything I can do? Or do I even should?  
At the end of the day, all I care about is her well-being. And I'll accept whatever the reality is. 

 Maybe it's worth mentioning:  
She had never in a relationship before, nor she was ever romantically involved in someone. She is a virgin, extremely closed-off person.

1gi63gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1gi63gl/tooth_has_been_eroding_away_after_being_chipped/,Tooth has been eroding away after being chipped,"I’d really appreciate some help/advice! 

A couple years ago I got a very small chip in one of my front teeth. It was like a couple grains of sand just crumbled off the corner of my tooth for no discernible reason. At the time my dentist didn’t have any advice for me and didn’t do anything. However that rough edge where it was chipped has slowly continued to erode away over time. My tooth has lost a lot more enamel than the original chip now, and it’s only getting worse. 

I had a dentist visit a few months ago but they rushed me in and out and didn’t give me a chance to ask questions. I’m looking for a new dentist but I would really appreciate any advice.

What can I do to stop my tooth from wearing away any further? What would a dentist recommend? Would they smooth down that edge so it doesn’t wear down as easily? Will they put a coating of some kind over it? What can be done?

In appearance it’s noticeable that one front tooth is slightly shorter and lopsided compared to the other, with a strange sharp corner and slightly jagged edge . I can add a picture if it helps.

We’d hit up estate sales, thrift stores, garage sales, even old shops on their last legs, picking up whatever caught our eye to breathe new life into our home. Nearly everything around us had a story—things that, in their quiet way, had been through someone else’s life before they became part of ours. Cookware, furniture, our daughter’s toys, clothes—it didn’t matter. If it was well-made and had some years left, it was good enough for us.



Growing up the way we did, my wife and I both learned early on not to waste anything. We weren’t poor now, not by a long shot, but when you’ve spent your childhood stretching every dollar, that “waste-not” mentality never fully leaves. It’s more than a habit; it’s instinct.



I’d become something of a hawk for deals, tracking social media for those inevitable posts about local stores closing down, big sales, liquidations—anything with a shot at uncovering a hidden gem. It was like a hobby. And that’s how I found out about the toy store. An old post, buried deep on the community page, announced the auction of a local toy shop that had been a fixture in the town since the Great Depression.



The place was special. I’d been there once as a kid, and I remembered the almost magical feeling of the store—the smell of old wood and varnish, the glint of paint on row after row of handmade toys. This wasn’t your usual toy store. The owner, an older man everyone knew as Mr. Winslow, had poured his life into every toy, carving and painting each one by hand. Wooden soldiers, miniature dollhouses, delicate puzzles… everything you could imagine. He never imported a single thing, and every toy had a strange, vintage charm that you couldn’t find anywhere else.



Mr. Winslow and his wife had run the shop right up until they died, years apart. They didn’t have any family left, so the state had seized the property, and now they were auctioning everything off, right down to the last hand-carved toy. 



The sale was on a cold, gray Saturday. I convinced my wife it’d be worth checking out, maybe picking up a few toys for our daughter. The place was in rough shape, dim and drafty. Half the lights didn’t work, and the smell of dust lingered heavy in the air, clinging to everything like a veil. But the toys—they were immaculate. Each shelf was still filled with tiny wooden faces frozen in mid-expression, each toy glancing out at us, wide-eyed and almost… expectant. 



The crowd at the auction was familiar, dotted with faces I’d seen at sales like this before. Liquidation sales bring out a certain kind of person. You can always tell who’s a regular and who’s new to the scene just by watching them bid. The newcomers hesitate, test the waters before committing to any serious bid. But the regulars, the seasoned ones, they’ve got a rhythm. They know exactly how high to go, exactly when to pull back. Most of them aren’t there to pick up keepsakes; they’re there to flip it all for a profit online.



In most liquidation sales, they bundle the goods in bulk, which suits the resellers just fine. You see a table stacked with, say, a hundred of the same porcelain vase or unopened action figure; people bid on the lot, the highest bidder picks their fill, and then the next one steps up. It's efficient. By the end, whatever’s left just goes for the average bid price, first come, first serve.



But Mr. Winslow’s toy store wasn’t your average liquidation. No one was here for bulk toys from China, and no one was going to find a stack of hot-ticket items like last season’s electronics. Every item was unique, hand-crafted and individually priced. There wasn’t a single barcode in the building, not a plastic wrapper in sight. Every toy was a labor of love, something that had been sanded, painted, and assembled by hand. It was like stepping into a time capsule, each piece carrying a bit of the old man’s life and passion.



The toys looked like relics from another era: wooden horses with faded paint, lines of tin soldiers standing rigid, delicate porcelain dolls with blank, glassy eyes. There were marionettes on thin, tangled strings, and intricate dollhouses with hand-painted wallpaper and tiny furniture inside. Toys made for another world, another life. Most of the people there took one look and left early, their disinterest written all over their faces. These weren’t things that would sell for much online. And with the store’s gloomy atmosphere and the unsettling shadows cast by the dim light, I didn’t blame them.



But I was in it for more than a quick sale. I’d come to find a treasure, maybe something special to put on a shelf for our daughter or a keepsake to remind me of a place that had been in the town forever. So I stayed, wandering the aisles, running my fingers along the toys’ edges, feeling the worn, chipped paint under my fingers.



The auction had turned out to be a bust. I wandered around the store one last time, eyeing the shelves filled with dusty old toys, and I was just about ready to leave empty-handed when my daughter tugged on my sleeve.



“Daddy, look!”



She pointed to a battered old toy box shoved in a corner. Sitting upright inside it, propped against the side like she’d been carefully placed there, was a plush doll. But this wasn’t just any stuffed toy. The doll was eerily life-sized—just about the same height as my daughter, in fact. It had stringy blonde hair that cascaded messily down its shoulders, two large button eyes stitched onto a cloth face, and a stitched-on smile that seemed just a little too wide, curling up at the edges in a way that didn’t quite feel right. The doll wore a faded black dress with lace trimming, adding to its peculiar charm.



My daughter rushed over, her face lighting up with excitement. She plucked the doll from the toy box and hugged it tightly, like she’d found a long-lost friend. “Her name is Dolly!” she declared, squeezing the doll with the kind of fierce, unfiltered affection only a child can muster.



I looked at the doll more closely, a little unsettled by its fixed, button-eyed stare and that odd smile that seemed to follow me even as I shifted from side to side. There was something strange about its proportions, almost as if it had been crafted specifically to look like a child… but not quite.



The auctioneer, clearly tired of a morning spent trying to hawk dusty old toys to an uninterested crowd, noticed my interest and gave a half-hearted wave.



“Take it if you want,” he said with a shrug. “Ain’t nobody bidding on this junk. Most of it’s headed for the dump. You find anything else you like, feel free to pick through it. Won't cost you more than a few dollars.”



The truth was, there wasn’t anything else in that store I wanted, and after an auctioneer calls the merchandise “garbage,” it’s a good hint to leave. I paid him a few dollars for Dolly, who was now practically glued to my daughter’s side. She clutched the doll’s hand, looking at me with a beaming grin that melted any lingering doubts I might have had.



As we left, I noticed that my daughter was oddly quiet. Normally, she’d chatter all the way home, talking about every little thing she saw, but this time, she just held Dolly close, staring out the window with a sort of distant expression, almost like she was… listening. It was subtle, but it was there. I chalked it up to the thrill of her new toy, and figured she was probably just imagining adventures for Dolly, weaving stories in her head like she often did.



Still, something felt strange. I couldn’t shake the feeling that the doll’s stitched-on eyes were watching me, even as I drove, catching glimpses of it in the rearview mirror. And though my daughter was silent, there was a sort of tension in the car, a quiet that seemed to settle in like a chill.



We pulled into the driveway, and I glanced back at my daughter, who was still holding Dolly, her fingers entwined with the doll’s soft fabric hand. She looked up at me with a serene smile.



“She really likes it here, Daddy,” she whispered, as if Dolly herself had somehow told her.



The words sent a shiver down my spine. I told myself I was just being paranoid. After all, it was just a doll, a cheap, old-fashioned plush left over in a toy store no one cared about.



But as we stepped inside, I couldn’t help feeling we’d brought something else home with us that day, something that had been waiting patiently in that dusty corner, in a forgotten store full of discarded things. And now, it had found a new place to belong.



In the weeks that followed, my daughter’s attachment to Dolly grew into an obsession. At first, my wife and I thought it was adorable. Kids have imaginary friends all the time, right? And if she wanted to treat Dolly as her special friend, that seemed harmless enough. 



At any given moment, you could find my daughter playing with Dolly. She held tea parties for the two of them, setting up our good china in tiny rows on her play table. Dolly always had the seat of honor, perched across from my daughter, her button eyes staring straight ahead, her strange stitched smile ever-present.



When it wasn’t tea parties, it was “school.” My daughter would line up her other stuffed animals, but Dolly was always in the front row, right under her watchful eye. I’d hear her talking to Dolly, sometimes even scolding her in a low, serious voice, like she was dealing with a difficult student. She’d talk with Dolly while watching TV, telling her all the things that were happening on the screen as if the doll was hanging onto every word. We chalked it up to a vivid imagination.



But soon, things started to feel… different. I noticed my daughter no longer touched any of her other toys. They lay scattered around her room, gathering dust. Her entire world revolved around Dolly.



One evening, we sat down for dinner. It was spaghetti night, my daughter’s favorite, and my wife had gone all out. We called her to the table, expecting her to leave Dolly behind like usual. But tonight, she walked into the dining room, gripping Dolly by the arm, and carefully set her down on the chair next to her.



“Can Dolly have a plate too?” she asked, her voice full of a strange kind of insistence.



My wife and I exchanged a glance, an uneasy one. We both shrugged it off and played along, thinking it was just a phase. My wife set an empty plate in front of Dolly, miming a spoonful of spaghetti onto it with a playful smile.



But our daughter’s face fell, her expression crumpling as she stared down at the empty plate in front of Dolly.



“She needs real food, Mom,” she said, her voice small and hurt.



“Honey, she gets special pretend food, because she’s a pretend person,” my wife explained gently, trying to meet her halfway.



My daughter’s expression twisted into something dark and angry, a look we’d never seen from her before. Her face flushed, and her eyes filled with tears as she screamed, “No! Dolly hasn’t eaten in decades! She’s *hungry!*”



The words came out in a wail, raw and full of a desperate, gut-wrenching emotion that seemed so out of place. It was as if she was pleading for a real, living person, as though Dolly’s hunger was a tangible, undeniable fact. She grabbed the doll, cradling it protectively as if we had wronged it, her face red with frustration and hurt.



When we tried to calm her down, she started kicking, screaming, inconsolable. She clung to Dolly, her knuckles turning white, her small voice rising in a frantic, guttural cry that we’d never heard from her before. Eventually, we had no choice but to pick her up, gently prying her from Dolly’s side. She thrashed and shouted as we carried her to her room, leaving Dolly alone at the kitchen table.



As I closed her bedroom door, my heart still pounding from the outburst, I found myself staring back at the dining room. There sat Dolly, her button eyes unblinking, her crooked smile staring straight ahead as if mocking me.



The room felt quiet, too quiet, and as I stood there, I could’ve sworn I saw the faintest twitch in Dolly’s stitched mouth—a subtle shift, as if she were smiling just a bit wider. I shook it off, forcing myself to laugh at the absurdity of it. It was just a doll. Just fabric and stuffing.



But as I turned out the kitchen light, leaving Dolly in the darkness, I couldn’t shake the feeling that, somehow, she was still watching me.



It took a long time to calm our daughter down. She kept sniffling, wiping at her nose, and muttering how unfair it was that Dolly hadn’t been given food. She clutched at her pajamas, her small fists trembling with frustration and sorrow, saying she just wanted Dolly to be happy. My wife, always the peacemaker, gave me a gentle nudge.



""Just get the doll, please,"" she whispered, glancing back at our daughter. “It’ll help her calm down.”



I nodded, reluctantly heading back to the kitchen, feeling a strange knot forming in my stomach. As I walked into the room, an odd chill seeped into my skin, making me pause at the doorway.



Dolly wasn’t where we’d left her.



We had set her at the dinner table, facing her empty plate, exactly where my daughter had insisted. But now she was turned in her chair, her body rotated to face down the hallway—the hallway that led to my daughter’s room. Her button eyes seemed to glint in the dim light, her crooked smile somehow looking sharper, hungrier.



I shook my head, brushing off the unsettling feeling as a trick of the light. It was just a doll. Maybe the chair had shifted when my daughter thrashed in the dining room, and in the chaos, I just hadn’t noticed.



I picked Dolly up, her fabric cold against my skin, and carried her back to my daughter’s room. I stepped inside, and the moment my daughter saw Dolly in my hands, her face lit up, her eyes going wide with relief and joy. She jumped up, practically launching herself at me to grab her beloved doll. The way she held Dolly… it was like she was reuniting with a real friend, someone she’d been separated from for a lifetime.



“Thank you, Daddy,” she whispered, clutching Dolly tightly, pressing her cheek against the doll’s button-eyed face. My wife sat beside her on the bed, running her fingers through our daughter’s hair, soothing her. 



As the tension in the room faded, my daughter murmured something, barely a breath.



“What did you say, sweetie?” I asked, leaning closer.



She looked up at me, her face soft and serene, and repeated it, her voice clear. “Dolly’s full now.”



A shiver ran through me, but before I could think too much of it, she broke into a grin, her usual playful energy returning. “Can I watch TV now?”



My wife shot me a confused glance but quickly regained her composure. “After you eat your dinner, okay?”



Our daughter nodded, happily returning to the dining room to finish her meal. She didn’t ask about Dolly’s food, didn’t protest or insist on setting an extra plate. She ate without complaint, chattering occasionally about her favorite cartoons. The strange outburst over Dolly seemed forgotten, almost as if it hadn’t happened at all.



After dinner, she padded off to the living room and settled in front of the TV, Dolly perched beside her, her tiny hands still wrapped around the doll’s. We exchanged wary glances, but neither of us dared speak the questions lingering in our minds. The quiet in the house had returned, as if nothing unusual had happened at all.



That night, there were no more whispers about Dolly being hungry, no more outbursts or demands for extra plates at the table. My wife and I, unsure of what to make of it, decided to let it go. Whatever had happened, our daughter was calm, happy even. And if Dolly had something to do with that, well… we weren’t about to argue with a win.



That night, after we’d tucked our daughter into bed and cleaned up the kitchen, my wife and I sat together at the dining room table, mulling over the evening’s strange events.



""She’s eight now,” my wife said, her voice low, like she didn’t want to risk our daughter hearing, even though her room was on the other side of the house. “Isn’t she a little old to be pretending a doll is… well, *real*?”



I nodded, rubbing my temples. “I was thinking the same thing. I mean, she did this before, but back when she was really little—two or three, maybe. And even then, it wasn’t this intense.”



We’d both noticed that her behavior with Dolly was different than her usual flights of imagination. At that age, she’d had a few imaginary friends, nothing we worried about. She’d talk to her stuffed animals, play-act scenarios; it was normal stuff. But now, with Dolly, her behavior seemed… fervent. Like Dolly wasn’t just a doll she liked, but something essential, almost sacred to her.



“We could… maybe take the doll away?” I suggested, not liking the idea even as I said it.



My wife shook her head. “If we just took Dolly, she’d be inconsolable. And honestly, I don’t want another outburst like tonight. We’d have to handle it carefully.”



After a few minutes of back and forth, we came up with a plan: we’d gradually phase Dolly out. We’d get our daughter hooked on something new, a fun toy or playset she couldn’t resist, and once she’d lost interest in Dolly, we’d quietly take the doll away while she was at school.



But this plan was harder to execute than we thought.



We spent the next week scouring stores for the latest toys—something we usually avoided given our thrift-shop lifestyle. We bought dolls with accessories, elaborate playsets, building kits, anything we thought might catch her attention. We figured we’d splurge just this once if it meant keeping her happy and moving her away from Dolly.



Yet, no matter what we brought home, she barely looked at the new toys. Her enthusiasm was tepid, at best. She’d unwrap the new toy, inspect it with a polite sort of interest, and then inevitably wander back to wherever Dolly was waiting. My wife and I tried everything, even bringing home a new board game, hoping it’d be something we could play together as a family. But Dolly was always right there, tucked under my daughter’s arm or seated by her side, a silent companion with her button eyes and stitched smile, watching us from across the table.



Finally, in a last-ditch effort, we went out and bought her a tablet. We figured that with all the educational games, drawing apps, and videos at her fingertips, surely she’d be glued to it like most kids her age. But she barely gave it a second glance.



“Thanks, Mom and Dad,” she said when we handed it to her, but there was something distant in her eyes. She held Dolly close, almost protectively, her thumb tracing the doll’s tiny hand. “But… Dolly doesn’t like tablets.”



The words, though innocent enough, sent a chill down my spine. It was like she was speaking not for herself, but on behalf of her doll, as though Dolly had a voice, an opinion, a preference.



My wife and I exchanged worried glances. We’d tried everything, and it seemed our daughter’s attachment to Dolly was only deepening. She barely even touched the new toys; they lay untouched in her room, some still in their boxes, collecting dust.



With a heavy heart, we decided to go forward with our original plan. We would wait until she was at school, slip Dolly out of sight, and hope that, with enough new distractions around her, she’d find something else to latch onto. We both felt a pang of guilt—seeing the joy Dolly brought her, the way her face lit up when she held the doll, made it hard to imagine taking that away. But our concern for her well-being outweighed everything else.



So, we waited, biding our time, and hoped—hoped that, in Dolly’s absence, our daughter would turn her attention to one of the other toys.



But deep down, I had a feeling this wouldn’t go as smoothly as we hoped.



The night before we were set to pull off our plan, I had the strangest dream. At least, I *think* it was a dream.



I was lying in bed, staring up at the ceiling, when a chill crept over me. It felt like something was watching us, something cold and patient. I didn’t want to look, but in the way dreams force you, I felt my eyes drift toward the end of the bed. There, just at the edge of my vision, was Dolly. She was standing up, perfectly still, her button eyes fixed on me. I couldn’t make out any details—just her shadowy outline, a figure waiting silently, as if she had all the time in the world. Every time I tried to turn my head to look directly at her, she vanished, slipping back into the corner of my sight.



When I woke up, my heart was pounding, my skin damp with cold sweat. I shook it off, trying to convince myself it was just the stress of the past few weeks getting to me.



That morning, as planned, my wife took our daughter to school, distracting her with promises of a new game they’d play together that evening. The house felt unnaturally still once they were gone, a heavy silence that seemed to press against my skin.



I took a deep breath, heading into my daughter’s room, where Dolly was resting on her bed. Picking her up felt strange, like I was holding something more than just a doll. I avoided looking into those button eyes and quickly made my way to the pantry. I stuffed her into the top back corner, where my daughter wouldn’t think to look, carefully positioning her behind a stack of canned goods.



As expected, when my daughter came home and saw that Dolly was missing, all hell broke loose. The tantrum was unlike anything I’d ever seen. She stormed through the house, screaming, throwing things, demanding we give Dolly back. It was as if she was possessed by some uncontainable rage, her small face twisted into an expression that was both heartbroken and furious. My wife and I tried to calm her down, to reason with her, but she wasn’t listening.



""Where’s Dolly?” she shrieked, her voice hoarse from crying. “You’ll regret this! Dolly’s going to hurt you! She’ll make you sorry! Give her back!”



Her words left a chill running through my veins. This wasn’t our daughter speaking, not the sweet, gentle child we’d raised. She’d always been polite, soft-spoken, never the kind of kid who threw tantrums or even raised her voice much. But now, she seemed almost feral, her eyes wild with an intensity that was… unnerving.



The tantrum went on for hours, our daughter’s screams echoing through the house, until she finally wore herself out. With her voice raw and every tear shed, she collapsed onto the couch, exhausted and half-asleep. My wife and I sat nearby, sharing exhausted, worried glances, feeling like we’d made a terrible mistake but unable to go back on our decision now. Once we were sure she was asleep, we carried her to her bed, laying her down gently and turning on her night light. We murmured soft goodnights, though we made sure not to wake her.



We thought the worst of it was over for the night, that we’d weathered the storm and could finally get a moment to breathe.



But when we walked back into the living room, a chill settled over me, prickling the back of my neck. My heart dropped when I saw it.



There, sitting on the couch in the exact spot where my daughter had just been sleeping, was Dolly. She sat upright, her button eyes fixed straight ahead, her stitched smile just a little too wide, too knowing. 



We stood there, frozen, staring at her in stunned silence. Neither of us had touched the doll since I’d hidden her in the pantry. There was no way she could have gotten back to the living room on her own.



My wife reached out, her hand trembling, as if to pick Dolly up, but then thought better of it and pulled her hand back, wrapping her arms around herself instead.



I could feel the words I wanted to say caught in my throat. Instead, I moved forward slowly, as if approaching something dangerous, and took Dolly in my hands, her fabric cold and somehow… heavier than before. I was careful not to look at her too closely, afraid that if I met those button eyes for too long, I’d see something I couldn’t unsee.



I brought her back to the pantry, stuffing her into the corner again, this time piling more cans in front of her, pushing them in tightly to make sure she wouldn’t move. I left the pantry, shutting the door firmly behind me.



When I returned to the living room, my wife was still standing there, her face pale. We didn’t say a word. We just sat there in silence, the weight of that empty stitched smile lingering in the room.



And as we sat there, I found myself thinking about my daughter’s words, her warning echoing in my mind: “Dolly’s going to hurt you. She’ll make you sorry.”



My wife and I sat on the couch, staring at each other, hearts pounding in our chests, with the realization that neither of us had moved Dolly from her hiding place in the pantry. We both knew it couldn’t have been our daughter, either; she’d been asleep the whole time. And yet… there was Dolly, sitting in the exact spot where our daughter had drifted off on the couch, like she’d claimed it as her own.



“This is too much,” my wife whispered, her voice shaky. “I don’t want that doll in the house anymore. Please, just… get rid of it.”



She looked at me with pleading eyes, and I couldn’t blame her. Every logical part of me wanted to dismiss what was happening, but that feeling—that lingering chill creeping down my spine—told me it was best to listen. I didn’t want Dolly here, either. Whatever this was, it needed to end.



I scooped Dolly up, feeling that unnatural heaviness in her again, like she was almost pulling me back, as if the doll didn’t want to leave. I ignored the way her stitched smile seemed to stretch just a little more as I turned toward the door, telling myself it was just a trick of my tired mind. I had to get her out.



Outside, the early morning was eerily quiet. The community dumpster stood at the far end of the lot, and I made my way over, clutching Dolly tight, every step feeling more difficult than the last. A weight, like icy fingers, seemed to wrap around my shoulders, tendrils of dread clawing at my chest. It was ridiculous; I knew it was just a doll, but it felt like something was whispering in my ear, urging me to stop. To turn around. To take Dolly back inside.



I shook it off, forcing myself to keep walking. When I reached the dumpster, I flung the lid open, staring into the dark, reeking void below. With a grimace, I tossed Dolly inside, hearing the muffled thud as she hit the bottom, then slammed the heavy lid shut with a sense of finality.



As I walked back to the house, a small but persistent voice in my mind whispered that this wasn’t over. But I pushed it down, reasoning that we’d done the right thing. Dolly was gone. Our daughter would be upset, but with some time, she’d move on.



The next morning, when our daughter woke up, her eyes darted around the room, searching, and she quickly realized Dolly was missing. Her face fell, and she looked up at me, desperation clouding her eyes. But this time, she was different. It was as though something in her understood, resigned and hurt. She didn’t throw a tantrum. She didn’t scream or demand Dolly back. She just sighed, shoulders slumped, and went about getting ready for school with a defeated sort of sadness.



“Promise to be good, okay?” I said, brushing her hair out of her face as she sat at the breakfast table. She nodded, though her gaze was fixed somewhere distant, somewhere I couldn’t follow.



After we got her on the bus and my wife headed to work, I finally allowed myself to relax. Maybe we’d done it, I thought. Maybe we’d finally won the battle.



I made myself a coffee, settled into my office, and powered up my laptop, planning to get some work done in the quiet house. The familiar hum of the computer and the routine of logging into emails and files felt comforting, ordinary. I let myself get lost in it, ignoring the lingering memories of the past few days, trying to embrace the calm.



But then, just as I was settling in, I heard it: a soft, drawn-out creak, like someone slowly pushing the door open. 



My heart froze. I looked up from my screen, eyes darting to the door. It was open, just a crack, though I distinctly remembered shutting it when I’d sat down.



“Hello?” I called, my voice barely more than a whisper, straining to listen for any sound in return. Nothing.



A chill ran down my spine as I pushed back from my desk, rising slowly, my eyes locked on that narrow sliver of the door, as if expecting something to appear there. I took a cautious step forward, reaching out to push the door wider, my breath caught in my throat.



And that’s when I saw it.



Sitting there, just outside my office, was Dolly.



She was propped up in the hallway, her button eyes fixed on the door, her head tilted just slightly, as if she were studying me. That stitched smile, wider than I remembered, curved in an expression that was almost… triumphant.



I stumbled back, feeling my stomach twist as that dreadful realization settled over me. I’d thrown her away. I’d *seen* her hit the bottom of that dumpster. But here she was, back in my house, waiting, like she’d never left.



Dolly sat there, covered in dirt, grime, and bits of garbage clinging to her black dress, her button eyes still fixed on me. For a moment, I could only stare, paralyzed by disbelief and dread. I took a step back, not even noticing the wall behind me until my shoulders hit it. I had thrown her away—*I had seen her at the bottom of that dumpster*. And yet, here she was, sitting on my hallway floor, filthy and somehow more sinister than ever.



Then, before I could even process what I was seeing, Dolly began to rise. Her small body lifted into the air, hovering just above the floor. The air felt thick, almost electric, like the whole house was holding its breath. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. 



Then, in a rush, a series of images flashed through my mind. Terrible, twisted visions filled my head—screaming faces, dark, tangled forests, and a sense of looming, inescapable dread. The world around me seemed to fade away, swallowed by shadows. My vision blurred, and in the next instant, I was no longer standing in my hallway.



I was in a forest, a dense, suffocating darkness pressing down on me from all sides. My heart pounded in my chest as I ran, my legs pumping through thick underbrush. My feet stumbled over roots and rocks, my lungs burning as I gasped for air. It was like being inside the worst kind of nightmare, but the terror was too real, too sharp to dismiss as mere fantasy. Something was behind me—*chasing* me.



I risked a glance over my shoulder, and my blood ran cold. A massive beast, towering and monstrous, loped through the shadows, its movements fluid but unnatural, as if its joints were barely holding together. It looked like a wolf, but larger than any wolf I’d ever seen, with a gaping maw that stretched grotesquely across its face, almost as if it were barely attached by a thin hinge of jaw. Its eyes burned a bright, unsettling red, like twin buttons sewn deep into its skull, and its body was held together with thick, fraying threads, giving it a twisted, stitched appearance that reminded me horribly of Dolly.



The beast let out a growl, and the sound was like a thousand voices, guttural and inhuman. I stumbled, my legs giving out beneath me as I crashed to the forest floor. The rancid smell of decay filled the air as the creature loomed over me, its hot, foul breath washing over my face. It was like staring into the face of a nightmare made real, a vision of pure, unfiltered terror.



I tried to push myself up, to run, but the beast was too fast. It lowered its massive head, baring rows of jagged, yellowed teeth, each one as sharp as a dagger. I braced my arms against its maw, desperate to hold it back, but the beast was impossibly strong. Black, oily ichor dripped from its mouth, splattering onto my arms and chest, the stench nearly choking me.



“*This isn’t real!*” I shouted, my voice breaking with desperation. “*Leave me alone!*”



But the creature’s glowing red eyes narrowed, and I felt a crushing weight as it bore down on me. Its teeth sunk into my shoulder, sending a wave of agony tearing through my body. I screamed, the pain sharp and cold, a raw fire spreading through my veins. I could feel its teeth tearing into me, feel the slick heat of blood as it spilled down my side.



With a surge of frantic energy, I brought my knee up, slamming it into the beast’s chest, trying to shove it back. But it barely budged. The creature’s maw twisted, a sick, twisted semblance of a grin, its red button eyes glinting with something almost… playful.



“*Wake up! WAKE UP!*” I yelled, every ounce of my mind focused on breaking free of this nightmare. I was trapped, I knew it, but I couldn’t give up. Images of my daughter, my wife, flashed before my eyes, filling me with a fierce determination. I couldn’t let this thing win. I couldn’t let it keep me here.



With a final scream, I pushed against the creature, throwing every ounce of strength I had into one last desperate shove. My body ached, my mind felt splintered, but I focused on them—on my family—on getting back to them. The creature’s grip loosened, if only slightly, and I clawed at the ground, digging my fingers into the dirt as I struggled to pull myself free.



I kept fighting, clinging to that small, stubborn spark of hope. And then, with a sudden, blinding flash, the forest disappeared. 



I found myself back in the hallway, Dolly lying lifeless on the ground in front of me. My head was spinning, still trapped somewhere between the nightmare forest and reality. But one sensation cut through the fog: a searing pain on my chest. I pressed my hand to it, feeling the strange, raw heat radiating from beneath my shirt.



With trembling hands, I pulled my shirt over my head and looked down. My skin was marked with thick, jagged scars—pale and twisted, like they’d been there for years. They traced the spot where the beast had sunk its teeth, a brutal reminder of what I had just endured, or maybe… *survived*.



I looked down at Dolly, her button eyes gazing blankly up at me, her face filled with that eerie, stitched grin. Rage bubbled up inside me, pushing past the confusion and horror of what had just happened. Enough was enough. This doll had wormed its way into my life, into my daughter’s mind, and I couldn’t let it haunt us any longer.



Without another thought, I scooped her up and strode to the garage. I grabbed a can of kerosene, nearly spilling it in my haste, and snatched a box of matches we kept for family fires in the backyard. Today, we’d be having a fire of a different kind.



The backyard was quiet, almost too quiet, as I made my way to the fire pit. I threw Dolly in, her soft body crumpling against the grate, and stuffed a few pieces of old newspaper around her. The doll’s face stared up at me, an almost pleading look in her button eyes. And then, out of nowhere, I felt it—*hesitation*. A nagging, sick feeling gnawed at me, a tiny voice in my head begging me to stop, like I was about to destroy something important, something I should cherish.



It was absurd, but the feeling was almost overwhelming, like Dolly herself was reaching into my mind, whispering to me, making me doubt.



*No*, I told myself. *She’s nothing. Just a doll.*



I shook off the creeping doubt, forcing my hands to steady as I unscrewed the kerosene cap and doused her, watching as the liquid soaked into her fabric, darkening the black dress and matting her tangled hair. With one last breath, I struck a match and, without hesitating further, tossed it in.



The flames roared to life, but instead of the usual red and orange, they flickered a strange, dark purple, licking over Dolly’s body with an otherworldly glow. I watched, transfixed, as her face seemed to contort within the flames, her button eyes bulging slightly, her smile twisting as if alive, fighting against the fire’s embrace. But I held firm, rooted to the spot, determined to watch until there was nothing left but ashes.



I sat there by the fire pit, ignoring the urgent pings of work emails and notifications from my laptop still inside. None of it mattered. Not right now. I stayed there, keeping vigil until the doll was nothing more than charred scraps, the purple flames fading into smoldering embers.



Hours later, when it was time to pick up my daughter from school, I finally stood up, feeling a strange mixture of relief and exhaustion. Dolly was gone, nothing more than a burnt heap. But the scars on my chest tingled, reminding me of the nightmare I couldn’t quite shake.



When I picked up my daughter from school that afternoon, she came running toward me, her face lighting up with that familiar, heartwarming grin. It was as if the past few weeks—the tantrums, the outbursts, the strange fixation on Dolly—had never happened. She wrapped her arms around my waist, her voice bubbling with excitement.



“Daddy! Guess what? I got a gold star on my spelling test! And we made clay animals in art today. Mine’s a bunny. I’ll bring it home to show you tomorrow!”



I hugged her back, feeling a weight lift from my shoulders. It was like having my little girl back, the bright, happy child I’d known before Dolly came into our lives. The darkness that had hung over her seemed to have vanished, leaving no trace, no lingering shadows. She didn’t ask about Dolly. She didn’t even seem to notice the doll was gone.



That night, as we sat down for dinner, she chattered about her day, telling us all the little details we’d missed, her laughter filling the house with warmth that had been absent for far too long. My wife and I exchanged relieved glances, finally allowing ourselves to believe that it was over.



Later, after our daughter was asleep, I told my wife everything. The nightmare in the forest, the scars on my chest, the way Dolly had been lying in the hallway, filthy and somehow… waiting. I explained how I’d taken her to the fire pit, how I’d watched the doll burn with those strange purple flames, staying there until I was sure every last piece of her was gone.



My wife listened, her expression shifting from shock to disbelief. I could tell she was skeptical, and who could blame her? I wasn’t sure I’d believe it myself if I hadn’t seen it all firsthand. But in the end, she squeezed my hand, her lips curving into a soft smile.



“Well, real or not,” she said, “I’m just glad that thing is gone. Our daughter’s back, and that’s what matters.”



I nodded, feeling the scars on my chest itch slightly under my shirt, something that will always remind me of the nightmare I’d lived through. But as I looked down the hall, hearing my daughter’s soft breathing from her room, I knew that we were finally safe.



Dolly was gone. Our daughter was free. And, for the first time in weeks, our home felt like ours again.

The first light of dawn slipped through the curtains, casting soft, golden hues across the room. Aria stirred beneath her blankets, groaning softly as her alarm began its shrill beeping, announcing the start of a day she’d been anticipating for months. Her hand shot out, silencing it, and she sat up, blinking the sleep from her bright blue eyes. They glimmered like ocean waves against her bronze skin, a striking contrast framed by the cascade of long, raven-black hair spilling over her shoulders.
Today was it. The day she would move out of Aunt Rhea’s cozy little house and into her new apartment near Wolfwater University.
Aria dressed in a simple but favorite outfit: a fitted black tee and jeans. She slipped on her necklace—a black leather choker with rings and chains dangling from it—and took one last look at her room, filled with memories. Her bags were already packed, sitting by the door, ready to go. With a deep breath, she left her room and made her way down the hall, catching the scent of something warm and familiar.
In the kitchen, her Aunt Rhea was busy at the stove, flipping pancakes with practiced ease. The soft sound of sizzling butter filled the air, and the table was already set. Rhea, with her warm smile and gentle eyes, looked over her shoulder as Aria walked in.
""Morning, sweetheart,” Rhea greeted, her voice gentle as always, though Aria noticed a hint of sadness behind her smile. “Are you ready for the big day?”
“As ready as I’ll ever be,” Aria replied, forcing a grin as she took a seat at the table. “Excited, nervous… kind of everything all at once.”
Rhea chuckled, placing a stack of pancakes in front of her before settling into the chair across from her. “Sounds about right,” she said, pouring them each a glass of orange juice. “You’re going to do amazing, Aria. It’s been a long time coming.”
Aria nodded, taking a bite of pancake, savoring the warmth and sweetness. Breakfast with Rhea had been a comforting ritual these past few years, and now that she was about to move out, it hit her how much she’d miss it. “Do you think Wolfwater will be… I don’t know, different?” Aria asked, stirring her orange juice absentmindedly. “I mean, everyone talks about how strange things get there.”
Rhea’s smile faded just a little as she looked at Aria thoughtfully. “Wolfwater has its quirks,” she said carefully. “It’s an old place, full of history and all kinds of people… some who aren’t quite ordinary.” Her eyes held a hint of warning, though her tone remained warm. “You may find yourself around a few unusual characters. Just keep an open mind, but trust your instincts, alright?”
Aria’s curiosity piqued. She’d heard rumors, of course—stories of Wolfwater being a little different, a little… enchanted. But she’d dismissed most of them, assuming they were local legends, whispers passed down through generations.
“You make it sound like I’ll be meeting wizards and werewolves,” Aria joked, raising an eyebrow.
Rhea chuckled, though there was a twinkle in her eye that Aria couldn’t quite read. “Just remember, not everything is what it seems at first glance. You may be surprised.”
They finished breakfast in comfortable silence, and after clearing the dishes, Aria gave Rhea a long, tight hug. The scent of lavender and honey surrounded her, grounding her one last time before she stepped into the unknown.
“Take care of yourself, sweetheart,” Rhea murmured as they broke apart. “And if you ever need me, I’m just a phone call away.”
“Thank you, Aunt Rhea,” Aria said, her voice catching slightly. “For everything.”
With one last, lingering glance, she picked up her bags and stepped out the door, her heart pounding with anticipation and a hint of bittersweetness. Today marked the beginning of a new life, one filled with mystery, independence, and the unknown world of Wolfwater University.

Ch.2
The cab finally pulled up in front of my new apartment building, and I took a moment to let it all sink in. The towering, ivy-covered brick exterior was charming in its old-world style, slightly out of place but somehow perfectly fitting in the strange, misty town of Wolfwater. I paid the cab driver and took a deep breath, then stepped out, my bags clutched in my hands as I gazed up at my new home. The night air was thick with the scent of pine and earth, a welcome change from the city’s constant noise and smell.
As I walked into the building, I was greeted by an older gentleman at the front desk. He wore a warm smile, his eyes crinkling behind a pair of round glasses as he took me in. He gave off a grandfatherly vibe, like he was genuinely excited to see a new face.
“You must be Miss Aria,” he said with a kind tone, extending a hand. “Welcome to Wolfwater. I’m Jason, the night doorman here.”
“Thank you, Jason,” I replied, smiling as I shook his hand. “It’s good to be here. This place already feels...different.”
Jason chuckled knowingly, his gaze drifting to the darkened street outside the glass doors. “Wolfwater tends to have that effect on people. A place with history, you know, layers of secrets and stories.” He leaned in just a little, his voice dropping to a whisper as if sharing something just for me. “People say there are...unusual things around here. Some claim they’ve even seen werewolves roaming the outskirts of town.”
My curiosity piqued, and I raised an eyebrow. “Werewolves? Really?”
“Oh, yes,” he nodded, his tone playful but with a glint in his eye that made me wonder if he was half-serious. “There’s more to Wolfwater than meets the eye. Some people think it’s all old legends, stories told to keep the tourists entertained. But others...well, some folks here believe in the tales wholeheartedly.”
A shiver ran through me, equal parts excitement and intrigue. I had always been drawn to mysteries, and this place seemed to offer plenty of them. “Well, I’ll be sure to keep an eye out,” I said with a grin. “Thanks for the welcome, Jason.”
“My pleasure, Miss Aria. If you ever need anything or just want to hear more about the town, you know where to find me,” he said with a wink as he handed me the key to my apartment.
I took my bags, nodded to Jason, and headed toward the elevator. My heart was racing a little, part from the lingering excitement of his words, part from the anticipation of stepping into a space that was entirely mine. When I reached my floor, I made my way to the apartment door, turning the key with a satisfying click and pushing it open. I was greeted by a cozy two-bedroom, one-bathroom space, bathed in the soft glow of the ceiling light. The walls were bare, and the floors gleamed with polished wood. The simple layout was perfect—a blank canvas waiting for my personal touch.
Setting down my bags, I pulled out my phone, fingers already itching to start decorating. The possibilities felt endless. My aunt had been kind enough to buy a few essentials: a beautiful black couch with soft pastel pink throw pillows, a coffee table with a white marble top, and a set of pastel pink and black chairs in the corner, which added a touch of elegance to the living room. The bedroom had a black iron-framed bed with soft white bedding—simple yet classy.
I began scrolling through an online decor shop, adding items to my cart as I imagined my vision coming together. Plants for the corners, string lights for a soft glow, a few abstract paintings for the walls. Before long, I was knee-deep in a wishlist of cozy blankets, a blush pink rug, and some fairy lights for the balcony. This space would be mine, all mine—a safe haven from the world outside.
After a while, I decided it was time to start unpacking. I hung up a few clothes in the closet, put away some toiletries in the bathroom, and carefully arranged a few framed photos on the dresser. The emptiness of the apartment was slowly giving way to something warmer, something that felt more like home. I stood back, admiring the balance of colors my aunt had chosen—black, pastel pink, and a few touches of white here and there. It was perfect. Somehow, she’d managed to make the place feel like it was meant for me, even before I’d set foot inside.
When I was finally done unpacking, I wandered out to the balcony, pushing open the sliding glass door. The night air was cool against my skin, and the view of the quiet town below was hauntingly beautiful. Wolfwater was like nothing I’d ever experienced, as if it held secrets hidden in plain sight, just waiting to be discovered. I could hear the faint hoot of an owl and the rustling of leaves in the trees nearby. It was peaceful yet filled with a strange kind of energy, as if the town itself was alive.
As I leaned against the railing, I couldn’t help but wonder what the night would bring. The stars glittered overhead, scattered across the velvety sky, and a sense of anticipation tugged at me, hinting that maybe Jason’s stories held some truth. Maybe there was more to this town than legends and rumors.
The town lights flickered softly around me as I stood on my balcony, exhaling a slow stream of smoke into the night air. It was quiet here, but not the empty kind of quiet I’d grown used to in the city—this was a silence with life in it, something thrumming beneath the surface. I tilted my head back and gazed at the stars, remembering the stories my grandmother used to tell. Stories of the creatures that roamed the night, of beasts with magic and power, bound to each other in ways I could barely understand.
A flicker in my peripheral vision snapped me out of my thoughts. A shadow cut through the night, descending toward me. I squinted, trying to make it out—a hawk, maybe? Or an eagle? Its wings spread wide, edged in silver that gleamed like molten gold in the moonlight. I watched, entranced, as the bird glided down and landed gracefully on my balcony railing, its piercing gaze locked onto mine.
“Hello, Aria.”
I jolted, dropping my cigarette, which fizzled out on the concrete. The voice hadn’t come from outside me but from within, resonating through my mind like a calm whisper echoing in my soul. 
“You—did you just…?” My voice trembled, caught between wonder and fear.
The bird tilted its head, amusement flashing in its intense, otherworldly eyes. “I did. You can hear me. That’s good.”
My heart raced as I stared at him, trying to make sense of what was happening. It wasn’t just a bird—it was a man, a presence somehow woven into this creature’s form. I wanted to say something, to ask a million questions, but my mouth felt dry, the words caught in my throat.
“I didn’t mean to frighten you,” he said, his voice as gentle as it was strange. “My name is Gabriel. I’m a shifter…of sorts. This is my preferred form. I find the air far more comfortable than the ground.”
“A shifter?” I echoed, finally finding my voice. “And…you know my name. Why?”
Gabriel’s eyes softened, and I felt a strange calm settle over me. “That’s a question I wish I could fully answer. It came to me when I saw your face as if remembering it from somewhere. I was drawn to you, as if something called me here. But it’s not in the way of a mate, if that’s what you’re wondering.” There was a trace of humor in his tone, a bittersweet note woven into his words. “It’s…different. Something else.”
My grip on the railing tightened as I tried to process it all. “So, there’s a mate thing for people like you?” I asked, a tremor of curiosity in my voice. “Like… a soulmate?”
He nodded, and the light in his eyes softened, turning wistful. “Yes. We shifters have a second soul within us, gifted by the moon goddess, Selene. For werewolves, it’s a wolf soul. It’s an ancient bond shared by all of our kind—a harmony of two souls within one body. Selene ensures each of us is matched with another, a fated mate. It’s… more than love. It’s like… finding the other half of your soul.”
His words struck something deep within me, as if his description opened a part of me I hadn’t known was there. Two souls, one body, created for each other. The idea was beautiful, and I could feel a soft, unspoken longing within myself, something I’d never dared admit. “Does everyone get a mate?” I asked, unable to keep the hope from my voice.
“Every shifter does,” he answered gently. “We’re created that way, with a match destined for us.”
A heavy ache settled in my chest as his words sunk in. I looked down, my voice barely a whisper. “Humans…don’t get mates like that, do they?”
The silence between us stretched, answering the question for me. Finally, Gabriel’s voice softened even more. “I’m sorry, Aria,” he said. “Humans don’t have a second soul. It’s a gift reserved for those like me, bound to Selene’s magic.”
I nodded, forcing a small smile. “Of course. That makes sense.” But the ache remained, a quiet longing nestled deep within me that wouldn’t let go. The idea of a bond like that, one that went beyond simple words or gestures, was almost too perfect to imagine. 
“Goodnight, Aria,” Gabriel said gently, his wings stretching out under the moonlight. “It was an honor to meet you. Until next time.” With a final pulse of his presence in my mind, he lifted off the railing, gliding into the night like some shadow of the stars.
I stayed there long after he’d gone, wrapped in the silence, my thoughts tangled in images of moonlit creatures and tales of soul-deep love. Finally, I pulled myself away from the balcony and slipped inside, collapsing onto my bed, the city lights casting faint, silver patches on my ceiling. As I lay there, my mind drifted back to the goddess he’d mentioned, the one he called Selene. I wasn’t sure what made me do it, but I closed my eyes and let a quiet thought slip into the night.
“If you can hear me…” I whispered in my heart, feeling foolish but unable to stop myself. “I wish…I wish I could have a mate too. And maybe…even a soul like his if it isn’t too much.”
The silence answered, and as I drifted off to sleep, I could almost feel the weight of my words hanging in the air, a fragile wish carried away on stardust and moonlight.

Ch.3
Aaron POV
As I stepped into the grand hall of Alpha King Israel’s palace, the weight of tradition and power settled on my shoulders. I took a deep breath, letting the sight of marble floors, gleaming chandeliers, and the hum of conversation soak in. The annual Alpha Summit—it was the one time each year when Alphas and their Lunas from all over gathered, a sea of alliances, power plays, and conversations that shaped the future of our kind.
But tonight, all I could see were the mated pairs—the way they leaned close, the quiet smiles they shared. They had a completeness, a unity, that I could only feel in my connection with Atlas, my wolf. Even though he was always there, steady in the back of my mind, an ache still twisted in my chest.
“I’m here, Aaron,” Atlas murmured, his voice like a low hum beneath my thoughts. “You’re never alone.”
I managed a smile, grateful for him. “I know,” I thought back, feeling his steady warmth. “But sometimes, it’s still hard.”
I started moving through the crowd, nodding politely to the other Alphas. My expression was neutral, my focus split between the chatter around me and keeping my mind clear. But then, a familiar mocking voice cut through the noise.
“Well, if it isn’t Aaron,” came Wade’s sneering tone, dripping with condescension. “The unmated Alpha of the Eastwood Pack.”
I turned slowly to face him, keeping my expression calm. Wade stood there, his smug smirk mirrored by his mate, Vanessa, who looked me up and down as if she were inspecting something less than impressive.
“Oh, how tragic,” Vanessa chimed in, a fake pout on her lips. “Imagine leading a pack without a mate. How… incomplete.” She let her words hang in the air, each syllable barbed.
I felt my jaw clench, but I stayed silent, refusing to give them the satisfaction of a reaction. Comments like this were nothing new. Being an unmated Alpha in a world that revered mated pairs was a constant test of my patience.
Wade’s smirk deepened, his gaze mocking. “Must be lonely, right?” he continued. “How can you expect your pack to follow you, to trust you fully, when you’re... well, lacking?”
Atlas growled, simmering just beneath my skin, his anger feeding into mine. “Let me deal with him,” he urged, his voice tense. “Just one snap…”
I took a deep breath, feeling the heat in my chest. “Not here,” I told him, keeping my focus. But before I could respond, a powerful voice cut through the tension.
“Is there a problem here?”
The crowd went silent, heads turning to see Alpha King Israel approaching, his gaze as sharp as steel as he looked between Wade and me. The authority he carried was almost tangible, and I didn’t miss the flicker of fear in Wade’s eyes.
Wade cleared his throat, his posture stiffening as he tried to force a smile. “No, Your Majesty. Just… chatting with Aaron here.”
Israel raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced. His gaze settled on me, and for a moment, understanding passed between us. “I think it would be wise to remember,” he said, his voice a smooth yet firm warning, “that respect is a requirement among Alphas, not just a courtesy.”
Vanessa shifted uncomfortably, glancing nervously between Israel and Wade, but the King’s gaze didn’t waver.
“Aaron here,” he continued, nodding toward me, “is a respected Alpha with or without a mate. His strength, his leadership, and his value to this pack are not defined by who stands beside him.” His tone sharpened, each word a clear warning. “Any Alpha who would insult another on such grounds is not worthy of their title.”
Wade’s expression faltered, and I could see the faint tremble in Vanessa’s carefully painted smile. They both mumbled hasty apologies before slipping away, disappearing into the crowd as fast as they could.
Once they were out of sight, I let out a slow breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding. “Thank you, Your Majesty,” I said, inclining my head in respect.
Israel placed a hand on my shoulder, his gaze softening. “You didn’t need my help, Aaron. I know you can handle your own battles.” He paused, his tone shifting, almost fatherly. “But no Alpha should tolerate such disrespect. You’ve served your pack well; don’t let anyone question that.”
I nodded, a swell of gratitude rising in my chest. “I appreciate it,” I replied, my voice steadier than I felt. “Truly.”
Israel gave a slight nod, a flicker of a smile in his eyes before he turned to rejoin the crowd. I watched him go, my heart feeling lighter. Atlas stirred, his presence settling back into my mind, a comforting strength that reminded me I wasn’t alone.
“They’ll never understand what we have,” Atlas said, his voice calm and reassuring. “The connection between us and our pack—that’s what matters.”
I couldn’t help but smile, allowing Atlas’s words to steady me. As I looked around the hall, the weight of loneliness lifted just a little. Mates might bring strength, but so did loyalty, resilience, and a bond built over years of trust. I didn’t need to prove my worth to anyone but myself and my pack members.
With a renewed sense of purpose, I straightened, ready to face whatever came next. Soon enough it was time for the king to say a few words.
As I sat in the grand hall, I took a look around me. The room was filled with leaders from every corner of the kingdom—strong, capable alphas who commanded respect. But tonight, beneath the flickering torchlight and the scent of oak and cedar, I could feel something else in the air: reverence, maybe even a shared humility.
Then King Israel stepped forward, and the room fell silent. He was a commanding figure, with the presence that came from bearing the weight of a kingdom on his shoulders. His silver hair gleamed under the light, and his voice, when he spoke, carried a depth that demanded attention.
“My brothers and sisters,” he began, his gaze sweeping over us, his words laced with a gravity that I hadn’t expected. “We gather here tonight not just to strengthen our alliances, but to honor the Moon Goddess, Selene, whose light has guided our people through countless generations.”
There was a pause, a slight catch in his voice that didn’t go unnoticed. “Selene has blessed this kingdom more than I can say,” he continued, “but as many of you know, her blessings do not come without tests.”
He closed his eyes briefly, and when he opened them, I saw a deep, quiet pain there—a raw ache, kept hidden but never forgotten. “I have carried a wound in my heart for many moons. A wound that no healing can touch. My daughter…my own flesh and blood, taken from me when she was just a newborn.” His voice broke, just slightly, and I saw others shift uncomfortably, a few dipping their heads in silent respect.
“I have waited years,” he said, voice steadying, “praying that Selene might bring her back to me. And while that ache remains…I must hold on to the hope that she is out there, alive and protected by Selene’s light.” His hand came to rest on his chest, a silent gesture of longing, of undying love.
King Israel took a slow breath, then looked over to his Luna Queen, Jessica, who stood by his side with her head held high, her own strength radiating through the room. His expression softened as he looked at her, the love between them as clear as day.
“I am blessed,” he said, his voice filled with a quiet strength, “to have my Luna, my Jessica, by my side. She has endured alongside me, has carried my burdens as if they were her own.” He turned to us all, his gaze fierce and unwavering. “And I am blessed to have each of you—alphas of integrity and courage, whose loyalty upholds the foundation of this kingdom.”
A murmur of agreement rippled through the crowd. I felt a swell of pride in my chest, knowing that I stood among those he spoke of, that I was one of those who held his loyalty. The honor of it grounded me, made the responsibilities I carried feel both lighter and heavier all at once.
“But tonight,” he continued, a smile breaking the solemnity, “I ask that you set aside your burdens, if only for a short time. We are more than just our responsibilities; we are bound together by a heritage, a history, a kinship forged in moonlight and strength.”
He raised his glass, and a sea of hands followed suit. “Be merry tonight, my brothers and sisters. For it is no easy thing to bear the burden of being an alpha. You have each earned this moment—take it and enjoy it.”
A cheer rose up, the energy shifting from solemnity to camaraderie as alphas toasted each other, the weight we bore easing just a little in the warmth of the celebration. I raised my own glass, meeting the gaze of those around me, feeling both pride and unity. Tonight, we would celebrate, we would laugh and share stories, if only to remind ourselves that we were more than the roles we carried.
But I couldn’t ignore the shadow of King Israel’s words—the ache for his lost daughter, the silent wish hanging in the air. It lingered in my mind as I took a sip, vowing silently to uphold that loyalty he valued so much, to bear my responsibilities in honor of the kingdom that he and Selene had blessed.

Ch.4
The sky was a tapestry of deep indigo and scattered stars as Gabriel glided through the night, his wings cutting silently through the cool air. Below him, nestled at the edge of the forest, was a small clearing where he sensed Aaron’s familiar presence. He landed with practiced grace, shifting as he touched the ground, and his sleek, feathered form melted into that of George, a man cloaked in shadow and moonlight.
Aaron was already waiting, leaning casually against a tree, his arms crossed over his chest. Even from a distance, George could feel the warmth of his wolf’s aura, radiating with the wild, earthy strength of the forest. Aaron’s emerald eyes met Georges’s with a sharpness that was almost predatory.
“You’ve been gone a while,” Aaron remarked, his voice low and slightly edged, though not unkind.
George offered a slight smile, shrugging as he approached. “I got…sidetracked. How was the summit?”
“It…actually wasn’t too bad this year. You’re not getting out of this though. Sidetracked how?” Aaron asked rather irritably.
“Met someone interesting.”
Aaron’s brows lifted, and he pushed himself off the tree, his eyes narrowing slightly. “Someone interesting?”
But before Gabriel could answer, Aaron’s expression shifted, his nose twitching as he caught a faint, familiar scent on the air, mingling with Gabriel’s own. His jaw tensed, and he took a slow step closer, his gaze fixed on Gabriel with a sudden intensity. There was no mistaking it: the delicate, unique scent that clung faintly to Gabriel was his mate’s, unmistakable even in its softness.
“MATE!” Aaron growled out. His eyes flashed with barely restrained energy. “You saw her?”
George’s smile faded slightly, understanding the importance of the bond but sensing Aaron’s protectiveness rise to the surface. “Yes,” he answered carefully. “I didn’t know she was yours until just now.” He shrugged, though there was a touch of reverence in his voice. “She has a power about her, even in her humanity.”
Aaron’s gaze darkened, his posture stiffening. “And you approached her?”
George held up a hand, meeting Aaron’s gaze with calm assurance. “I didn’t approach her with any intention beyond a conversation. There was a pull, yes, but not the kind that belongs to me. She’s your mate, Aaron, and I have no wish to intrude.”
Aaron let out a slow breath, some of the tension leaving his shoulders, though his eyes never left George’s. “What did you two talk about? And you said humanity. She’s human?”
A flicker of amusement crossed Gabriel’s face. “She smells human but I have a feeling there’s more to her than that. I didn’t really linger long but she asked about mates and I told her…oh goddess I told her humans didn’t get mates…” he trailed off, sadness lacing his voice.
Aaron’s eyes softened at that, and he allowed a faint smile, imagining his mate’s sadness…Soon my little mate. “A human and a wolf. Well she’s gotta be something special if she’s mated to a wolf let alone an alpha.” 
They stood in silence for a moment, the night settling around them, broken only by the sounds of crickets and the occasional rustle of leaves. Aaron looked down, as though grounding himself in the earth beneath his feet. When he looked up again, there was a glint of gratitude in his gaze.
“Thank you, Gabriel,” he said quietly. “For keeping her company—and for respecting the bond.”
George dipped his head in acknowledgment, his expression sincere as one of his eyes turned golden, a sign that Gabriel was now present as well “I’m not one to interfere with fated bonds, Aaron. I felt she was important to someone, even before I knew it was you. All I did was give her company under the stars.” His gaze turned distant, thoughtful. “Aria has a way of calming the night.”
Aaron nodded, and for a moment, his gaze softened completely, his eyes filled with a deep, abiding warmth. “Aria,” he whispered, tasting his mate’s name on his tongue. He loved the way it sounded.
George gave him a nod of understanding, an expression of shared respect and loyalty passing between them. With that, he took a step back, his form shimmering as he began to shift once more into his feathered self, ready to take flight.
“Aaron,” he said, pausing mid-transformation, his voice softer. “Take care of her.”
Aaron’s gaze held steady, his voice resolute. “Always.” 
Gabriel dipped his head one last time, and with a beat of powerful wings, he took to the sky, disappearing into the night as swiftly as he had come. Aaron watched him go, the faint scent of Aria lingering in the air, filling him with a renewed sense of purpose and love.",0,1730580441.0,werewolves,0,0.5,False

We’d hit up estate sales, thrift stores, garage sales, even old shops on their last legs, picking up whatever caught our eye to breathe new life into our home. Nearly everything around us had a story—things that, in their quiet way, had been through someone else’s life before they became part of ours. Cookware, furniture, our daughter’s toys, clothes—it didn’t matter. If it was well-made and had some years left, it was good enough for us.



Growing up the way we did, my wife and I both learned early on not to waste anything. We weren’t poor now, not by a long shot, but when you’ve spent your childhood stretching every dollar, that “waste-not” mentality never fully leaves. It’s more than a habit; it’s instinct.



I’d become something of a hawk for deals, tracking social media for those inevitable posts about local stores closing down, big sales, liquidations—anything with a shot at uncovering a hidden gem. It was like a hobby. And that’s how I found out about the toy store. An old post, buried deep on the community page, announced the auction of a local toy shop that had been a fixture in the town since the Great Depression.



The place was special. I’d been there once as a kid, and I remembered the almost magical feeling of the store—the smell of old wood and varnish, the glint of paint on row after row of handmade toys. This wasn’t your usual toy store. The owner, an older man everyone knew as Mr. Winslow, had poured his life into every toy, carving and painting each one by hand. Wooden soldiers, miniature dollhouses, delicate puzzles… everything you could imagine. He never imported a single thing, and every toy had a strange, vintage charm that you couldn’t find anywhere else.



Mr. Winslow and his wife had run the shop right up until they died, years apart. They didn’t have any family left, so the state had seized the property, and now they were auctioning everything off, right down to the last hand-carved toy. 



The sale was on a cold, gray Saturday. I convinced my wife it’d be worth checking out, maybe picking up a few toys for our daughter. The place was in rough shape, dim and drafty. Half the lights didn’t work, and the smell of dust lingered heavy in the air, clinging to everything like a veil. But the toys—they were immaculate. Each shelf was still filled with tiny wooden faces frozen in mid-expression, each toy glancing out at us, wide-eyed and almost… expectant. 



The crowd at the auction was familiar, dotted with faces I’d seen at sales like this before. Liquidation sales bring out a certain kind of person. You can always tell who’s a regular and who’s new to the scene just by watching them bid. The newcomers hesitate, test the waters before committing to any serious bid. But the regulars, the seasoned ones, they’ve got a rhythm. They know exactly how high to go, exactly when to pull back. Most of them aren’t there to pick up keepsakes; they’re there to flip it all for a profit online.



In most liquidation sales, they bundle the goods in bulk, which suits the resellers just fine. You see a table stacked with, say, a hundred of the same porcelain vase or unopened action figure; people bid on the lot, the highest bidder picks their fill, and then the next one steps up. It's efficient. By the end, whatever’s left just goes for the average bid price, first come, first serve.



But Mr. Winslow’s toy store wasn’t your average liquidation. No one was here for bulk toys from China, and no one was going to find a stack of hot-ticket items like last season’s electronics. Every item was unique, hand-crafted and individually priced. There wasn’t a single barcode in the building, not a plastic wrapper in sight. Every toy was a labor of love, something that had been sanded, painted, and assembled by hand. It was like stepping into a time capsule, each piece carrying a bit of the old man’s life and passion.



The toys looked like relics from another era: wooden horses with faded paint, lines of tin soldiers standing rigid, delicate porcelain dolls with blank, glassy eyes. There were marionettes on thin, tangled strings, and intricate dollhouses with hand-painted wallpaper and tiny furniture inside. Toys made for another world, another life. Most of the people there took one look and left early, their disinterest written all over their faces. These weren’t things that would sell for much online. And with the store’s gloomy atmosphere and the unsettling shadows cast by the dim light, I didn’t blame them.



But I was in it for more than a quick sale. I’d come to find a treasure, maybe something special to put on a shelf for our daughter or a keepsake to remind me of a place that had been in the town forever. So I stayed, wandering the aisles, running my fingers along the toys’ edges, feeling the worn, chipped paint under my fingers.



The auction had turned out to be a bust. I wandered around the store one last time, eyeing the shelves filled with dusty old toys, and I was just about ready to leave empty-handed when my daughter tugged on my sleeve.



“Daddy, look!”



She pointed to a battered old toy box shoved in a corner. Sitting upright inside it, propped against the side like she’d been carefully placed there, was a plush doll. But this wasn’t just any stuffed toy. The doll was eerily life-sized—just about the same height as my daughter, in fact. It had stringy blonde hair that cascaded messily down its shoulders, two large button eyes stitched onto a cloth face, and a stitched-on smile that seemed just a little too wide, curling up at the edges in a way that didn’t quite feel right. The doll wore a faded black dress with lace trimming, adding to its peculiar charm.



My daughter rushed over, her face lighting up with excitement. She plucked the doll from the toy box and hugged it tightly, like she’d found a long-lost friend. “Her name is Dolly!” she declared, squeezing the doll with the kind of fierce, unfiltered affection only a child can muster.



I looked at the doll more closely, a little unsettled by its fixed, button-eyed stare and that odd smile that seemed to follow me even as I shifted from side to side. There was something strange about its proportions, almost as if it had been crafted specifically to look like a child… but not quite.



The auctioneer, clearly tired of a morning spent trying to hawk dusty old toys to an uninterested crowd, noticed my interest and gave a half-hearted wave.



“Take it if you want,” he said with a shrug. “Ain’t nobody bidding on this junk. Most of it’s headed for the dump. You find anything else you like, feel free to pick through it. Won't cost you more than a few dollars.”



The truth was, there wasn’t anything else in that store I wanted, and after an auctioneer calls the merchandise “garbage,” it’s a good hint to leave. I paid him a few dollars for Dolly, who was now practically glued to my daughter’s side. She clutched the doll’s hand, looking at me with a beaming grin that melted any lingering doubts I might have had.



As we left, I noticed that my daughter was oddly quiet. Normally, she’d chatter all the way home, talking about every little thing she saw, but this time, she just held Dolly close, staring out the window with a sort of distant expression, almost like she was… listening. It was subtle, but it was there. I chalked it up to the thrill of her new toy, and figured she was probably just imagining adventures for Dolly, weaving stories in her head like she often did.



Still, something felt strange. I couldn’t shake the feeling that the doll’s stitched-on eyes were watching me, even as I drove, catching glimpses of it in the rearview mirror. And though my daughter was silent, there was a sort of tension in the car, a quiet that seemed to settle in like a chill.



We pulled into the driveway, and I glanced back at my daughter, who was still holding Dolly, her fingers entwined with the doll’s soft fabric hand. She looked up at me with a serene smile.



“She really likes it here, Daddy,” she whispered, as if Dolly herself had somehow told her.



The words sent a shiver down my spine. I told myself I was just being paranoid. After all, it was just a doll, a cheap, old-fashioned plush left over in a toy store no one cared about.



But as we stepped inside, I couldn’t help feeling we’d brought something else home with us that day, something that had been waiting patiently in that dusty corner, in a forgotten store full of discarded things. And now, it had found a new place to belong.



In the weeks that followed, my daughter’s attachment to Dolly grew into an obsession. At first, my wife and I thought it was adorable. Kids have imaginary friends all the time, right? And if she wanted to treat Dolly as her special friend, that seemed harmless enough. 



At any given moment, you could find my daughter playing with Dolly. She held tea parties for the two of them, setting up our good china in tiny rows on her play table. Dolly always had the seat of honor, perched across from my daughter, her button eyes staring straight ahead, her strange stitched smile ever-present.



When it wasn’t tea parties, it was “school.” My daughter would line up her other stuffed animals, but Dolly was always in the front row, right under her watchful eye. I’d hear her talking to Dolly, sometimes even scolding her in a low, serious voice, like she was dealing with a difficult student. She’d talk with Dolly while watching TV, telling her all the things that were happening on the screen as if the doll was hanging onto every word. We chalked it up to a vivid imagination.



But soon, things started to feel… different. I noticed my daughter no longer touched any of her other toys. They lay scattered around her room, gathering dust. Her entire world revolved around Dolly.



One evening, we sat down for dinner. It was spaghetti night, my daughter’s favorite, and my wife had gone all out. We called her to the table, expecting her to leave Dolly behind like usual. But tonight, she walked into the dining room, gripping Dolly by the arm, and carefully set her down on the chair next to her.



“Can Dolly have a plate too?” she asked, her voice full of a strange kind of insistence.



My wife and I exchanged a glance, an uneasy one. We both shrugged it off and played along, thinking it was just a phase. My wife set an empty plate in front of Dolly, miming a spoonful of spaghetti onto it with a playful smile.



But our daughter’s face fell, her expression crumpling as she stared down at the empty plate in front of Dolly.



“She needs real food, Mom,” she said, her voice small and hurt.



“Honey, she gets special pretend food, because she’s a pretend person,” my wife explained gently, trying to meet her halfway.



My daughter’s expression twisted into something dark and angry, a look we’d never seen from her before. Her face flushed, and her eyes filled with tears as she screamed, “No! Dolly hasn’t eaten in decades! She’s *hungry!*”



The words came out in a wail, raw and full of a desperate, gut-wrenching emotion that seemed so out of place. It was as if she was pleading for a real, living person, as though Dolly’s hunger was a tangible, undeniable fact. She grabbed the doll, cradling it protectively as if we had wronged it, her face red with frustration and hurt.



When we tried to calm her down, she started kicking, screaming, inconsolable. She clung to Dolly, her knuckles turning white, her small voice rising in a frantic, guttural cry that we’d never heard from her before. Eventually, we had no choice but to pick her up, gently prying her from Dolly’s side. She thrashed and shouted as we carried her to her room, leaving Dolly alone at the kitchen table.



As I closed her bedroom door, my heart still pounding from the outburst, I found myself staring back at the dining room. There sat Dolly, her button eyes unblinking, her crooked smile staring straight ahead as if mocking me.



The room felt quiet, too quiet, and as I stood there, I could’ve sworn I saw the faintest twitch in Dolly’s stitched mouth—a subtle shift, as if she were smiling just a bit wider. I shook it off, forcing myself to laugh at the absurdity of it. It was just a doll. Just fabric and stuffing.



But as I turned out the kitchen light, leaving Dolly in the darkness, I couldn’t shake the feeling that, somehow, she was still watching me.



It took a long time to calm our daughter down. She kept sniffling, wiping at her nose, and muttering how unfair it was that Dolly hadn’t been given food. She clutched at her pajamas, her small fists trembling with frustration and sorrow, saying she just wanted Dolly to be happy. My wife, always the peacemaker, gave me a gentle nudge.



""Just get the doll, please,"" she whispered, glancing back at our daughter. “It’ll help her calm down.”



I nodded, reluctantly heading back to the kitchen, feeling a strange knot forming in my stomach. As I walked into the room, an odd chill seeped into my skin, making me pause at the doorway.



Dolly wasn’t where we’d left her.



We had set her at the dinner table, facing her empty plate, exactly where my daughter had insisted. But now she was turned in her chair, her body rotated to face down the hallway—the hallway that led to my daughter’s room. Her button eyes seemed to glint in the dim light, her crooked smile somehow looking sharper, hungrier.



I shook my head, brushing off the unsettling feeling as a trick of the light. It was just a doll. Maybe the chair had shifted when my daughter thrashed in the dining room, and in the chaos, I just hadn’t noticed.



I picked Dolly up, her fabric cold against my skin, and carried her back to my daughter’s room. I stepped inside, and the moment my daughter saw Dolly in my hands, her face lit up, her eyes going wide with relief and joy. She jumped up, practically launching herself at me to grab her beloved doll. The way she held Dolly… it was like she was reuniting with a real friend, someone she’d been separated from for a lifetime.



“Thank you, Daddy,” she whispered, clutching Dolly tightly, pressing her cheek against the doll’s button-eyed face. My wife sat beside her on the bed, running her fingers through our daughter’s hair, soothing her. 



As the tension in the room faded, my daughter murmured something, barely a breath.



“What did you say, sweetie?” I asked, leaning closer.



She looked up at me, her face soft and serene, and repeated it, her voice clear. “Dolly’s full now.”



A shiver ran through me, but before I could think too much of it, she broke into a grin, her usual playful energy returning. “Can I watch TV now?”



My wife shot me a confused glance but quickly regained her composure. “After you eat your dinner, okay?”



Our daughter nodded, happily returning to the dining room to finish her meal. She didn’t ask about Dolly’s food, didn’t protest or insist on setting an extra plate. She ate without complaint, chattering occasionally about her favorite cartoons. The strange outburst over Dolly seemed forgotten, almost as if it hadn’t happened at all.



After dinner, she padded off to the living room and settled in front of the TV, Dolly perched beside her, her tiny hands still wrapped around the doll’s. We exchanged wary glances, but neither of us dared speak the questions lingering in our minds. The quiet in the house had returned, as if nothing unusual had happened at all.



That night, there were no more whispers about Dolly being hungry, no more outbursts or demands for extra plates at the table. My wife and I, unsure of what to make of it, decided to let it go. Whatever had happened, our daughter was calm, happy even. And if Dolly had something to do with that, well… we weren’t about to argue with a win.



That night, after we’d tucked our daughter into bed and cleaned up the kitchen, my wife and I sat together at the dining room table, mulling over the evening’s strange events.



""She’s eight now,” my wife said, her voice low, like she didn’t want to risk our daughter hearing, even though her room was on the other side of the house. “Isn’t she a little old to be pretending a doll is… well, *real*?”



I nodded, rubbing my temples. “I was thinking the same thing. I mean, she did this before, but back when she was really little—two or three, maybe. And even then, it wasn’t this intense.”



We’d both noticed that her behavior with Dolly was different than her usual flights of imagination. At that age, she’d had a few imaginary friends, nothing we worried about. She’d talk to her stuffed animals, play-act scenarios; it was normal stuff. But now, with Dolly, her behavior seemed… fervent. Like Dolly wasn’t just a doll she liked, but something essential, almost sacred to her.



“We could… maybe take the doll away?” I suggested, not liking the idea even as I said it.



My wife shook her head. “If we just took Dolly, she’d be inconsolable. And honestly, I don’t want another outburst like tonight. We’d have to handle it carefully.”



After a few minutes of back and forth, we came up with a plan: we’d gradually phase Dolly out. We’d get our daughter hooked on something new, a fun toy or playset she couldn’t resist, and once she’d lost interest in Dolly, we’d quietly take the doll away while she was at school.



But this plan was harder to execute than we thought.



We spent the next week scouring stores for the latest toys—something we usually avoided given our thrift-shop lifestyle. We bought dolls with accessories, elaborate playsets, building kits, anything we thought might catch her attention. We figured we’d splurge just this once if it meant keeping her happy and moving her away from Dolly.



Yet, no matter what we brought home, she barely looked at the new toys. Her enthusiasm was tepid, at best. She’d unwrap the new toy, inspect it with a polite sort of interest, and then inevitably wander back to wherever Dolly was waiting. My wife and I tried everything, even bringing home a new board game, hoping it’d be something we could play together as a family. But Dolly was always right there, tucked under my daughter’s arm or seated by her side, a silent companion with her button eyes and stitched smile, watching us from across the table.



Finally, in a last-ditch effort, we went out and bought her a tablet. We figured that with all the educational games, drawing apps, and videos at her fingertips, surely she’d be glued to it like most kids her age. But she barely gave it a second glance.



“Thanks, Mom and Dad,” she said when we handed it to her, but there was something distant in her eyes. She held Dolly close, almost protectively, her thumb tracing the doll’s tiny hand. “But… Dolly doesn’t like tablets.”



The words, though innocent enough, sent a chill down my spine. It was like she was speaking not for herself, but on behalf of her doll, as though Dolly had a voice, an opinion, a preference.



My wife and I exchanged worried glances. We’d tried everything, and it seemed our daughter’s attachment to Dolly was only deepening. She barely even touched the new toys; they lay untouched in her room, some still in their boxes, collecting dust.



With a heavy heart, we decided to go forward with our original plan. We would wait until she was at school, slip Dolly out of sight, and hope that, with enough new distractions around her, she’d find something else to latch onto. We both felt a pang of guilt—seeing the joy Dolly brought her, the way her face lit up when she held the doll, made it hard to imagine taking that away. But our concern for her well-being outweighed everything else.



So, we waited, biding our time, and hoped—hoped that, in Dolly’s absence, our daughter would turn her attention to one of the other toys.



But deep down, I had a feeling this wouldn’t go as smoothly as we hoped.



The night before we were set to pull off our plan, I had the strangest dream. At least, I *think* it was a dream.



I was lying in bed, staring up at the ceiling, when a chill crept over me. It felt like something was watching us, something cold and patient. I didn’t want to look, but in the way dreams force you, I felt my eyes drift toward the end of the bed. There, just at the edge of my vision, was Dolly. She was standing up, perfectly still, her button eyes fixed on me. I couldn’t make out any details—just her shadowy outline, a figure waiting silently, as if she had all the time in the world. Every time I tried to turn my head to look directly at her, she vanished, slipping back into the corner of my sight.



When I woke up, my heart was pounding, my skin damp with cold sweat. I shook it off, trying to convince myself it was just the stress of the past few weeks getting to me.



That morning, as planned, my wife took our daughter to school, distracting her with promises of a new game they’d play together that evening. The house felt unnaturally still once they were gone, a heavy silence that seemed to press against my skin.



I took a deep breath, heading into my daughter’s room, where Dolly was resting on her bed. Picking her up felt strange, like I was holding something more than just a doll. I avoided looking into those button eyes and quickly made my way to the pantry. I stuffed her into the top back corner, where my daughter wouldn’t think to look, carefully positioning her behind a stack of canned goods.



As expected, when my daughter came home and saw that Dolly was missing, all hell broke loose. The tantrum was unlike anything I’d ever seen. She stormed through the house, screaming, throwing things, demanding we give Dolly back. It was as if she was possessed by some uncontainable rage, her small face twisted into an expression that was both heartbroken and furious. My wife and I tried to calm her down, to reason with her, but she wasn’t listening.



""Where’s Dolly?” she shrieked, her voice hoarse from crying. “You’ll regret this! Dolly’s going to hurt you! She’ll make you sorry! Give her back!”



Her words left a chill running through my veins. This wasn’t our daughter speaking, not the sweet, gentle child we’d raised. She’d always been polite, soft-spoken, never the kind of kid who threw tantrums or even raised her voice much. But now, she seemed almost feral, her eyes wild with an intensity that was… unnerving.



The tantrum went on for hours, our daughter’s screams echoing through the house, until she finally wore herself out. With her voice raw and every tear shed, she collapsed onto the couch, exhausted and half-asleep. My wife and I sat nearby, sharing exhausted, worried glances, feeling like we’d made a terrible mistake but unable to go back on our decision now. Once we were sure she was asleep, we carried her to her bed, laying her down gently and turning on her night light. We murmured soft goodnights, though we made sure not to wake her.



We thought the worst of it was over for the night, that we’d weathered the storm and could finally get a moment to breathe.



But when we walked back into the living room, a chill settled over me, prickling the back of my neck. My heart dropped when I saw it.



There, sitting on the couch in the exact spot where my daughter had just been sleeping, was Dolly. She sat upright, her button eyes fixed straight ahead, her stitched smile just a little too wide, too knowing. 



We stood there, frozen, staring at her in stunned silence. Neither of us had touched the doll since I’d hidden her in the pantry. There was no way she could have gotten back to the living room on her own.



My wife reached out, her hand trembling, as if to pick Dolly up, but then thought better of it and pulled her hand back, wrapping her arms around herself instead.



I could feel the words I wanted to say caught in my throat. Instead, I moved forward slowly, as if approaching something dangerous, and took Dolly in my hands, her fabric cold and somehow… heavier than before. I was careful not to look at her too closely, afraid that if I met those button eyes for too long, I’d see something I couldn’t unsee.



I brought her back to the pantry, stuffing her into the corner again, this time piling more cans in front of her, pushing them in tightly to make sure she wouldn’t move. I left the pantry, shutting the door firmly behind me.



When I returned to the living room, my wife was still standing there, her face pale. We didn’t say a word. We just sat there in silence, the weight of that empty stitched smile lingering in the room.



And as we sat there, I found myself thinking about my daughter’s words, her warning echoing in my mind: “Dolly’s going to hurt you. She’ll make you sorry.”



My wife and I sat on the couch, staring at each other, hearts pounding in our chests, with the realization that neither of us had moved Dolly from her hiding place in the pantry. We both knew it couldn’t have been our daughter, either; she’d been asleep the whole time. And yet… there was Dolly, sitting in the exact spot where our daughter had drifted off on the couch, like she’d claimed it as her own.



“This is too much,” my wife whispered, her voice shaky. “I don’t want that doll in the house anymore. Please, just… get rid of it.”



She looked at me with pleading eyes, and I couldn’t blame her. Every logical part of me wanted to dismiss what was happening, but that feeling—that lingering chill creeping down my spine—told me it was best to listen. I didn’t want Dolly here, either. Whatever this was, it needed to end.



I scooped Dolly up, feeling that unnatural heaviness in her again, like she was almost pulling me back, as if the doll didn’t want to leave. I ignored the way her stitched smile seemed to stretch just a little more as I turned toward the door, telling myself it was just a trick of my tired mind. I had to get her out.



Outside, the early morning was eerily quiet. The community dumpster stood at the far end of the lot, and I made my way over, clutching Dolly tight, every step feeling more difficult than the last. A weight, like icy fingers, seemed to wrap around my shoulders, tendrils of dread clawing at my chest. It was ridiculous; I knew it was just a doll, but it felt like something was whispering in my ear, urging me to stop. To turn around. To take Dolly back inside.



I shook it off, forcing myself to keep walking. When I reached the dumpster, I flung the lid open, staring into the dark, reeking void below. With a grimace, I tossed Dolly inside, hearing the muffled thud as she hit the bottom, then slammed the heavy lid shut with a sense of finality.



As I walked back to the house, a small but persistent voice in my mind whispered that this wasn’t over. But I pushed it down, reasoning that we’d done the right thing. Dolly was gone. Our daughter would be upset, but with some time, she’d move on.



The next morning, when our daughter woke up, her eyes darted around the room, searching, and she quickly realized Dolly was missing. Her face fell, and she looked up at me, desperation clouding her eyes. But this time, she was different. It was as though something in her understood, resigned and hurt. She didn’t throw a tantrum. She didn’t scream or demand Dolly back. She just sighed, shoulders slumped, and went about getting ready for school with a defeated sort of sadness.



“Promise to be good, okay?” I said, brushing her hair out of her face as she sat at the breakfast table. She nodded, though her gaze was fixed somewhere distant, somewhere I couldn’t follow.



After we got her on the bus and my wife headed to work, I finally allowed myself to relax. Maybe we’d done it, I thought. Maybe we’d finally won the battle.



I made myself a coffee, settled into my office, and powered up my laptop, planning to get some work done in the quiet house. The familiar hum of the computer and the routine of logging into emails and files felt comforting, ordinary. I let myself get lost in it, ignoring the lingering memories of the past few days, trying to embrace the calm.



But then, just as I was settling in, I heard it: a soft, drawn-out creak, like someone slowly pushing the door open. 



My heart froze. I looked up from my screen, eyes darting to the door. It was open, just a crack, though I distinctly remembered shutting it when I’d sat down.



“Hello?” I called, my voice barely more than a whisper, straining to listen for any sound in return. Nothing.



A chill ran down my spine as I pushed back from my desk, rising slowly, my eyes locked on that narrow sliver of the door, as if expecting something to appear there. I took a cautious step forward, reaching out to push the door wider, my breath caught in my throat.



And that’s when I saw it.



Sitting there, just outside my office, was Dolly.



She was propped up in the hallway, her button eyes fixed on the door, her head tilted just slightly, as if she were studying me. That stitched smile, wider than I remembered, curved in an expression that was almost… triumphant.



I stumbled back, feeling my stomach twist as that dreadful realization settled over me. I’d thrown her away. I’d *seen* her hit the bottom of that dumpster. But here she was, back in my house, waiting, like she’d never left.



Dolly sat there, covered in dirt, grime, and bits of garbage clinging to her black dress, her button eyes still fixed on me. For a moment, I could only stare, paralyzed by disbelief and dread. I took a step back, not even noticing the wall behind me until my shoulders hit it. I had thrown her away—*I had seen her at the bottom of that dumpster*. And yet, here she was, sitting on my hallway floor, filthy and somehow more sinister than ever.



Then, before I could even process what I was seeing, Dolly began to rise. Her small body lifted into the air, hovering just above the floor. The air felt thick, almost electric, like the whole house was holding its breath. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. 



Then, in a rush, a series of images flashed through my mind. Terrible, twisted visions filled my head—screaming faces, dark, tangled forests, and a sense of looming, inescapable dread. The world around me seemed to fade away, swallowed by shadows. My vision blurred, and in the next instant, I was no longer standing in my hallway.



I was in a forest, a dense, suffocating darkness pressing down on me from all sides. My heart pounded in my chest as I ran, my legs pumping through thick underbrush. My feet stumbled over roots and rocks, my lungs burning as I gasped for air. It was like being inside the worst kind of nightmare, but the terror was too real, too sharp to dismiss as mere fantasy. Something was behind me—*chasing* me.



I risked a glance over my shoulder, and my blood ran cold. A massive beast, towering and monstrous, loped through the shadows, its movements fluid but unnatural, as if its joints were barely holding together. It looked like a wolf, but larger than any wolf I’d ever seen, with a gaping maw that stretched grotesquely across its face, almost as if it were barely attached by a thin hinge of jaw. Its eyes burned a bright, unsettling red, like twin buttons sewn deep into its skull, and its body was held together with thick, fraying threads, giving it a twisted, stitched appearance that reminded me horribly of Dolly.



The beast let out a growl, and the sound was like a thousand voices, guttural and inhuman. I stumbled, my legs giving out beneath me as I crashed to the forest floor. The rancid smell of decay filled the air as the creature loomed over me, its hot, foul breath washing over my face. It was like staring into the face of a nightmare made real, a vision of pure, unfiltered terror.



I tried to push myself up, to run, but the beast was too fast. It lowered its massive head, baring rows of jagged, yellowed teeth, each one as sharp as a dagger. I braced my arms against its maw, desperate to hold it back, but the beast was impossibly strong. Black, oily ichor dripped from its mouth, splattering onto my arms and chest, the stench nearly choking me.



“*This isn’t real!*” I shouted, my voice breaking with desperation. “*Leave me alone!*”



But the creature’s glowing red eyes narrowed, and I felt a crushing weight as it bore down on me. Its teeth sunk into my shoulder, sending a wave of agony tearing through my body. I screamed, the pain sharp and cold, a raw fire spreading through my veins. I could feel its teeth tearing into me, feel the slick heat of blood as it spilled down my side.



With a surge of frantic energy, I brought my knee up, slamming it into the beast’s chest, trying to shove it back. But it barely budged. The creature’s maw twisted, a sick, twisted semblance of a grin, its red button eyes glinting with something almost… playful.



“*Wake up! WAKE UP!*” I yelled, every ounce of my mind focused on breaking free of this nightmare. I was trapped, I knew it, but I couldn’t give up. Images of my daughter, my wife, flashed before my eyes, filling me with a fierce determination. I couldn’t let this thing win. I couldn’t let it keep me here.



With a final scream, I pushed against the creature, throwing every ounce of strength I had into one last desperate shove. My body ached, my mind felt splintered, but I focused on them—on my family—on getting back to them. The creature’s grip loosened, if only slightly, and I clawed at the ground, digging my fingers into the dirt as I struggled to pull myself free.



I kept fighting, clinging to that small, stubborn spark of hope. And then, with a sudden, blinding flash, the forest disappeared. 



I found myself back in the hallway, Dolly lying lifeless on the ground in front of me. My head was spinning, still trapped somewhere between the nightmare forest and reality. But one sensation cut through the fog: a searing pain on my chest. I pressed my hand to it, feeling the strange, raw heat radiating from beneath my shirt.



With trembling hands, I pulled my shirt over my head and looked down. My skin was marked with thick, jagged scars—pale and twisted, like they’d been there for years. They traced the spot where the beast had sunk its teeth, a brutal reminder of what I had just endured, or maybe… *survived*.



I looked down at Dolly, her button eyes gazing blankly up at me, her face filled with that eerie, stitched grin. Rage bubbled up inside me, pushing past the confusion and horror of what had just happened. Enough was enough. This doll had wormed its way into my life, into my daughter’s mind, and I couldn’t let it haunt us any longer.



Without another thought, I scooped her up and strode to the garage. I grabbed a can of kerosene, nearly spilling it in my haste, and snatched a box of matches we kept for family fires in the backyard. Today, we’d be having a fire of a different kind.



The backyard was quiet, almost too quiet, as I made my way to the fire pit. I threw Dolly in, her soft body crumpling against the grate, and stuffed a few pieces of old newspaper around her. The doll’s face stared up at me, an almost pleading look in her button eyes. And then, out of nowhere, I felt it—*hesitation*. A nagging, sick feeling gnawed at me, a tiny voice in my head begging me to stop, like I was about to destroy something important, something I should cherish.



It was absurd, but the feeling was almost overwhelming, like Dolly herself was reaching into my mind, whispering to me, making me doubt.



*No*, I told myself. *She’s nothing. Just a doll.*



I shook off the creeping doubt, forcing my hands to steady as I unscrewed the kerosene cap and doused her, watching as the liquid soaked into her fabric, darkening the black dress and matting her tangled hair. With one last breath, I struck a match and, without hesitating further, tossed it in.



The flames roared to life, but instead of the usual red and orange, they flickered a strange, dark purple, licking over Dolly’s body with an otherworldly glow. I watched, transfixed, as her face seemed to contort within the flames, her button eyes bulging slightly, her smile twisting as if alive, fighting against the fire’s embrace. But I held firm, rooted to the spot, determined to watch until there was nothing left but ashes.



I sat there by the fire pit, ignoring the urgent pings of work emails and notifications from my laptop still inside. None of it mattered. Not right now. I stayed there, keeping vigil until the doll was nothing more than charred scraps, the purple flames fading into smoldering embers.



Hours later, when it was time to pick up my daughter from school, I finally stood up, feeling a strange mixture of relief and exhaustion. Dolly was gone, nothing more than a burnt heap. But the scars on my chest tingled, reminding me of the nightmare I couldn’t quite shake.



When I picked up my daughter from school that afternoon, she came running toward me, her face lighting up with that familiar, heartwarming grin. It was as if the past few weeks—the tantrums, the outbursts, the strange fixation on Dolly—had never happened. She wrapped her arms around my waist, her voice bubbling with excitement.



“Daddy! Guess what? I got a gold star on my spelling test! And we made clay animals in art today. Mine’s a bunny. I’ll bring it home to show you tomorrow!”



I hugged her back, feeling a weight lift from my shoulders. It was like having my little girl back, the bright, happy child I’d known before Dolly came into our lives. The darkness that had hung over her seemed to have vanished, leaving no trace, no lingering shadows. She didn’t ask about Dolly. She didn’t even seem to notice the doll was gone.



That night, as we sat down for dinner, she chattered about her day, telling us all the little details we’d missed, her laughter filling the house with warmth that had been absent for far too long. My wife and I exchanged relieved glances, finally allowing ourselves to believe that it was over.



Later, after our daughter was asleep, I told my wife everything. The nightmare in the forest, the scars on my chest, the way Dolly had been lying in the hallway, filthy and somehow… waiting. I explained how I’d taken her to the fire pit, how I’d watched the doll burn with those strange purple flames, staying there until I was sure every last piece of her was gone.



My wife listened, her expression shifting from shock to disbelief. I could tell she was skeptical, and who could blame her? I wasn’t sure I’d believe it myself if I hadn’t seen it all firsthand. But in the end, she squeezed my hand, her lips curving into a soft smile.



“Well, real or not,” she said, “I’m just glad that thing is gone. Our daughter’s back, and that’s what matters.”



I nodded, feeling the scars on my chest itch slightly under my shirt, something that will always remind me of the nightmare I’d lived through. But as I looked down the hall, hearing my daughter’s soft breathing from her room, I knew that we were finally safe.



Dolly was gone. Our daughter was free. And, for the first time in weeks, our home felt like ours again.

1gi5zhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1gi5zhp/i_think_my_daughters_doll_is_possessed/,I think my daughter's doll is possessed,"Thrift shopping had always been a sort of ritual for my wife and me. We’d hit up estate sales, thrift stores, garage sales, even old shops on their last legs, picking up whatever caught our eye to breathe new life into our home. Nearly everything around us had a story—things that, in their quiet way, had been through someone else’s life before they became part of ours. Cookware, furniture, our daughter’s toys, clothes—it didn’t matter. If it was well-made and had some years left, it was good enough for us.



Growing up the way we did, my wife and I both learned early on not to waste anything. We weren’t poor now, not by a long shot, but when you’ve spent your childhood stretching every dollar, that “waste-not” mentality never fully leaves. It’s more than a habit; it’s instinct.



I’d become something of a hawk for deals, tracking social media for those inevitable posts about local stores closing down, big sales, liquidations—anything with a shot at uncovering a hidden gem. It was like a hobby. And that’s how I found out about the toy store. An old post, buried deep on the community page, announced the auction of a local toy shop that had been a fixture in the town since the Great Depression.



The place was special. I’d been there once as a kid, and I remembered the almost magical feeling of the store—the smell of old wood and varnish, the glint of paint on row after row of handmade toys. This wasn’t your usual toy store. The owner, an older man everyone knew as Mr. Winslow, had poured his life into every toy, carving and painting each one by hand. Wooden soldiers, miniature dollhouses, delicate puzzles… everything you could imagine. He never imported a single thing, and every toy had a strange, vintage charm that you couldn’t find anywhere else.



Mr. Winslow and his wife had run the shop right up until they died, years apart. They didn’t have any family left, so the state had seized the property, and now they were auctioning everything off, right down to the last hand-carved toy. 



The sale was on a cold, gray Saturday. I convinced my wife it’d be worth checking out, maybe picking up a few toys for our daughter. The place was in rough shape, dim and drafty. Half the lights didn’t work, and the smell of dust lingered heavy in the air, clinging to everything like a veil. But the toys—they were immaculate. Each shelf was still filled with tiny wooden faces frozen in mid-expression, each toy glancing out at us, wide-eyed and almost… expectant. 



The crowd at the auction was familiar, dotted with faces I’d seen at sales like this before. Liquidation sales bring out a certain kind of person. You can always tell who’s a regular and who’s new to the scene just by watching them bid. The newcomers hesitate, test the waters before committing to any serious bid. But the regulars, the seasoned ones, they’ve got a rhythm. They know exactly how high to go, exactly when to pull back. Most of them aren’t there to pick up keepsakes; they’re there to flip it all for a profit online.



In most liquidation sales, they bundle the goods in bulk, which suits the resellers just fine. You see a table stacked with, say, a hundred of the same porcelain vase or unopened action figure; people bid on the lot, the highest bidder picks their fill, and then the next one steps up. It's efficient. By the end, whatever’s left just goes for the average bid price, first come, first serve.



But Mr. Winslow’s toy store wasn’t your average liquidation. No one was here for bulk toys from China, and no one was going to find a stack of hot-ticket items like last season’s electronics. Every item was unique, hand-crafted and individually priced. There wasn’t a single barcode in the building, not a plastic wrapper in sight. Every toy was a labor of love, something that had been sanded, painted, and assembled by hand. It was like stepping into a time capsule, each piece carrying a bit of the old man’s life and passion.



The toys looked like relics from another era: wooden horses with faded paint, lines of tin soldiers standing rigid, delicate porcelain dolls with blank, glassy eyes. There were marionettes on thin, tangled strings, and intricate dollhouses with hand-painted wallpaper and tiny furniture inside. Toys made for another world, another life. Most of the people there took one look and left early, their disinterest written all over their faces. These weren’t things that would sell for much online. And with the store’s gloomy atmosphere and the unsettling shadows cast by the dim light, I didn’t blame them.



But I was in it for more than a quick sale. I’d come to find a treasure, maybe something special to put on a shelf for our daughter or a keepsake to remind me of a place that had been in the town forever. So I stayed, wandering the aisles, running my fingers along the toys’ edges, feeling the worn, chipped paint under my fingers.



The auction had turned out to be a bust. I wandered around the store one last time, eyeing the shelves filled with dusty old toys, and I was just about ready to leave empty-handed when my daughter tugged on my sleeve.



“Daddy, look!”



She pointed to a battered old toy box shoved in a corner. Sitting upright inside it, propped against the side like she’d been carefully placed there, was a plush doll. But this wasn’t just any stuffed toy. The doll was eerily life-sized—just about the same height as my daughter, in fact. It had stringy blonde hair that cascaded messily down its shoulders, two large button eyes stitched onto a cloth face, and a stitched-on smile that seemed just a little too wide, curling up at the edges in a way that didn’t quite feel right. The doll wore a faded black dress with lace trimming, adding to its peculiar charm.



My daughter rushed over, her face lighting up with excitement. She plucked the doll from the toy box and hugged it tightly, like she’d found a long-lost friend. “Her name is Dolly!” she declared, squeezing the doll with the kind of fierce, unfiltered affection only a child can muster.



I looked at the doll more closely, a little unsettled by its fixed, button-eyed stare and that odd smile that seemed to follow me even as I shifted from side to side. There was something strange about its proportions, almost as if it had been crafted specifically to look like a child… but not quite.



The auctioneer, clearly tired of a morning spent trying to hawk dusty old toys to an uninterested crowd, noticed my interest and gave a half-hearted wave.



“Take it if you want,” he said with a shrug. “Ain’t nobody bidding on this junk. Most of it’s headed for the dump. You find anything else you like, feel free to pick through it. Won't cost you more than a few dollars.”



The truth was, there wasn’t anything else in that store I wanted, and after an auctioneer calls the merchandise “garbage,” it’s a good hint to leave. I paid him a few dollars for Dolly, who was now practically glued to my daughter’s side. She clutched the doll’s hand, looking at me with a beaming grin that melted any lingering doubts I might have had.



As we left, I noticed that my daughter was oddly quiet. Normally, she’d chatter all the way home, talking about every little thing she saw, but this time, she just held Dolly close, staring out the window with a sort of distant expression, almost like she was… listening. It was subtle, but it was there. I chalked it up to the thrill of her new toy, and figured she was probably just imagining adventures for Dolly, weaving stories in her head like she often did.



Still, something felt strange. I couldn’t shake the feeling that the doll’s stitched-on eyes were watching me, even as I drove, catching glimpses of it in the rearview mirror. And though my daughter was silent, there was a sort of tension in the car, a quiet that seemed to settle in like a chill.



We pulled into the driveway, and I glanced back at my daughter, who was still holding Dolly, her fingers entwined with the doll’s soft fabric hand. She looked up at me with a serene smile.



“She really likes it here, Daddy,” she whispered, as if Dolly herself had somehow told her.



The words sent a shiver down my spine. I told myself I was just being paranoid. After all, it was just a doll, a cheap, old-fashioned plush left over in a toy store no one cared about.



But as we stepped inside, I couldn’t help feeling we’d brought something else home with us that day, something that had been waiting patiently in that dusty corner, in a forgotten store full of discarded things. And now, it had found a new place to belong.



In the weeks that followed, my daughter’s attachment to Dolly grew into an obsession. At first, my wife and I thought it was adorable. Kids have imaginary friends all the time, right? And if she wanted to treat Dolly as her special friend, that seemed harmless enough. 



At any given moment, you could find my daughter playing with Dolly. She held tea parties for the two of them, setting up our good china in tiny rows on her play table. Dolly always had the seat of honor, perched across from my daughter, her button eyes staring straight ahead, her strange stitched smile ever-present.



When it wasn’t tea parties, it was “school.” My daughter would line up her other stuffed animals, but Dolly was always in the front row, right under her watchful eye. I’d hear her talking to Dolly, sometimes even scolding her in a low, serious voice, like she was dealing with a difficult student. She’d talk with Dolly while watching TV, telling her all the things that were happening on the screen as if the doll was hanging onto every word. We chalked it up to a vivid imagination.



But soon, things started to feel… different. I noticed my daughter no longer touched any of her other toys. They lay scattered around her room, gathering dust. Her entire world revolved around Dolly.



One evening, we sat down for dinner. It was spaghetti night, my daughter’s favorite, and my wife had gone all out. We called her to the table, expecting her to leave Dolly behind like usual. But tonight, she walked into the dining room, gripping Dolly by the arm, and carefully set her down on the chair next to her.



“Can Dolly have a plate too?” she asked, her voice full of a strange kind of insistence.



My wife and I exchanged a glance, an uneasy one. We both shrugged it off and played along, thinking it was just a phase. My wife set an empty plate in front of Dolly, miming a spoonful of spaghetti onto it with a playful smile.



But our daughter’s face fell, her expression crumpling as she stared down at the empty plate in front of Dolly.



“She needs real food, Mom,” she said, her voice small and hurt.



“Honey, she gets special pretend food, because she’s a pretend person,” my wife explained gently, trying to meet her halfway.



My daughter’s expression twisted into something dark and angry, a look we’d never seen from her before. Her face flushed, and her eyes filled with tears as she screamed, “No! Dolly hasn’t eaten in decades! She’s *hungry!*”



The words came out in a wail, raw and full of a desperate, gut-wrenching emotion that seemed so out of place. It was as if she was pleading for a real, living person, as though Dolly’s hunger was a tangible, undeniable fact. She grabbed the doll, cradling it protectively as if we had wronged it, her face red with frustration and hurt.



When we tried to calm her down, she started kicking, screaming, inconsolable. She clung to Dolly, her knuckles turning white, her small voice rising in a frantic, guttural cry that we’d never heard from her before. Eventually, we had no choice but to pick her up, gently prying her from Dolly’s side. She thrashed and shouted as we carried her to her room, leaving Dolly alone at the kitchen table.



As I closed her bedroom door, my heart still pounding from the outburst, I found myself staring back at the dining room. There sat Dolly, her button eyes unblinking, her crooked smile staring straight ahead as if mocking me.



The room felt quiet, too quiet, and as I stood there, I could’ve sworn I saw the faintest twitch in Dolly’s stitched mouth—a subtle shift, as if she were smiling just a bit wider. I shook it off, forcing myself to laugh at the absurdity of it. It was just a doll. Just fabric and stuffing.



But as I turned out the kitchen light, leaving Dolly in the darkness, I couldn’t shake the feeling that, somehow, she was still watching me.



It took a long time to calm our daughter down. She kept sniffling, wiping at her nose, and muttering how unfair it was that Dolly hadn’t been given food. She clutched at her pajamas, her small fists trembling with frustration and sorrow, saying she just wanted Dolly to be happy. My wife, always the peacemaker, gave me a gentle nudge.



""Just get the doll, please,"" she whispered, glancing back at our daughter. “It’ll help her calm down.”



I nodded, reluctantly heading back to the kitchen, feeling a strange knot forming in my stomach. As I walked into the room, an odd chill seeped into my skin, making me pause at the doorway.



Dolly wasn’t where we’d left her.



We had set her at the dinner table, facing her empty plate, exactly where my daughter had insisted. But now she was turned in her chair, her body rotated to face down the hallway—the hallway that led to my daughter’s room. Her button eyes seemed to glint in the dim light, her crooked smile somehow looking sharper, hungrier.



I shook my head, brushing off the unsettling feeling as a trick of the light. It was just a doll. Maybe the chair had shifted when my daughter thrashed in the dining room, and in the chaos, I just hadn’t noticed.



I picked Dolly up, her fabric cold against my skin, and carried her back to my daughter’s room. I stepped inside, and the moment my daughter saw Dolly in my hands, her face lit up, her eyes going wide with relief and joy. She jumped up, practically launching herself at me to grab her beloved doll. The way she held Dolly… it was like she was reuniting with a real friend, someone she’d been separated from for a lifetime.



“Thank you, Daddy,” she whispered, clutching Dolly tightly, pressing her cheek against the doll’s button-eyed face. My wife sat beside her on the bed, running her fingers through our daughter’s hair, soothing her. 



As the tension in the room faded, my daughter murmured something, barely a breath.



“What did you say, sweetie?” I asked, leaning closer.



She looked up at me, her face soft and serene, and repeated it, her voice clear. “Dolly’s full now.”



A shiver ran through me, but before I could think too much of it, she broke into a grin, her usual playful energy returning. “Can I watch TV now?”



My wife shot me a confused glance but quickly regained her composure. “After you eat your dinner, okay?”



Our daughter nodded, happily returning to the dining room to finish her meal. She didn’t ask about Dolly’s food, didn’t protest or insist on setting an extra plate. She ate without complaint, chattering occasionally about her favorite cartoons. The strange outburst over Dolly seemed forgotten, almost as if it hadn’t happened at all.



After dinner, she padded off to the living room and settled in front of the TV, Dolly perched beside her, her tiny hands still wrapped around the doll’s. We exchanged wary glances, but neither of us dared speak the questions lingering in our minds. The quiet in the house had returned, as if nothing unusual had happened at all.



That night, there were no more whispers about Dolly being hungry, no more outbursts or demands for extra plates at the table. My wife and I, unsure of what to make of it, decided to let it go. Whatever had happened, our daughter was calm, happy even. And if Dolly had something to do with that, well… we weren’t about to argue with a win.



That night, after we’d tucked our daughter into bed and cleaned up the kitchen, my wife and I sat together at the dining room table, mulling over the evening’s strange events.



""She’s eight now,” my wife said, her voice low, like she didn’t want to risk our daughter hearing, even though her room was on the other side of the house. “Isn’t she a little old to be pretending a doll is… well, *real*?”



I nodded, rubbing my temples. “I was thinking the same thing. I mean, she did this before, but back when she was really little—two or three, maybe. And even then, it wasn’t this intense.”



We’d both noticed that her behavior with Dolly was different than her usual flights of imagination. At that age, she’d had a few imaginary friends, nothing we worried about. She’d talk to her stuffed animals, play-act scenarios; it was normal stuff. But now, with Dolly, her behavior seemed… fervent. Like Dolly wasn’t just a doll she liked, but something essential, almost sacred to her.



“We could… maybe take the doll away?” I suggested, not liking the idea even as I said it.



My wife shook her head. “If we just took Dolly, she’d be inconsolable. And honestly, I don’t want another outburst like tonight. We’d have to handle it carefully.”



After a few minutes of back and forth, we came up with a plan: we’d gradually phase Dolly out. We’d get our daughter hooked on something new, a fun toy or playset she couldn’t resist, and once she’d lost interest in Dolly, we’d quietly take the doll away while she was at school.



But this plan was harder to execute than we thought.



We spent the next week scouring stores for the latest toys—something we usually avoided given our thrift-shop lifestyle. We bought dolls with accessories, elaborate playsets, building kits, anything we thought might catch her attention. We figured we’d splurge just this once if it meant keeping her happy and moving her away from Dolly.



Yet, no matter what we brought home, she barely looked at the new toys. Her enthusiasm was tepid, at best. She’d unwrap the new toy, inspect it with a polite sort of interest, and then inevitably wander back to wherever Dolly was waiting. My wife and I tried everything, even bringing home a new board game, hoping it’d be something we could play together as a family. But Dolly was always right there, tucked under my daughter’s arm or seated by her side, a silent companion with her button eyes and stitched smile, watching us from across the table.



Finally, in a last-ditch effort, we went out and bought her a tablet. We figured that with all the educational games, drawing apps, and videos at her fingertips, surely she’d be glued to it like most kids her age. But she barely gave it a second glance.



“Thanks, Mom and Dad,” she said when we handed it to her, but there was something distant in her eyes. She held Dolly close, almost protectively, her thumb tracing the doll’s tiny hand. “But… Dolly doesn’t like tablets.”



The words, though innocent enough, sent a chill down my spine. It was like she was speaking not for herself, but on behalf of her doll, as though Dolly had a voice, an opinion, a preference.



My wife and I exchanged worried glances. We’d tried everything, and it seemed our daughter’s attachment to Dolly was only deepening. She barely even touched the new toys; they lay untouched in her room, some still in their boxes, collecting dust.



With a heavy heart, we decided to go forward with our original plan. We would wait until she was at school, slip Dolly out of sight, and hope that, with enough new distractions around her, she’d find something else to latch onto. We both felt a pang of guilt—seeing the joy Dolly brought her, the way her face lit up when she held the doll, made it hard to imagine taking that away. But our concern for her well-being outweighed everything else.



So, we waited, biding our time, and hoped—hoped that, in Dolly’s absence, our daughter would turn her attention to one of the other toys.



But deep down, I had a feeling this wouldn’t go as smoothly as we hoped.



The night before we were set to pull off our plan, I had the strangest dream. At least, I *think* it was a dream.



I was lying in bed, staring up at the ceiling, when a chill crept over me. It felt like something was watching us, something cold and patient. I didn’t want to look, but in the way dreams force you, I felt my eyes drift toward the end of the bed. There, just at the edge of my vision, was Dolly. She was standing up, perfectly still, her button eyes fixed on me. I couldn’t make out any details—just her shadowy outline, a figure waiting silently, as if she had all the time in the world. Every time I tried to turn my head to look directly at her, she vanished, slipping back into the corner of my sight.



When I woke up, my heart was pounding, my skin damp with cold sweat. I shook it off, trying to convince myself it was just the stress of the past few weeks getting to me.



That morning, as planned, my wife took our daughter to school, distracting her with promises of a new game they’d play together that evening. The house felt unnaturally still once they were gone, a heavy silence that seemed to press against my skin.



I took a deep breath, heading into my daughter’s room, where Dolly was resting on her bed. Picking her up felt strange, like I was holding something more than just a doll. I avoided looking into those button eyes and quickly made my way to the pantry. I stuffed her into the top back corner, where my daughter wouldn’t think to look, carefully positioning her behind a stack of canned goods.



As expected, when my daughter came home and saw that Dolly was missing, all hell broke loose. The tantrum was unlike anything I’d ever seen. She stormed through the house, screaming, throwing things, demanding we give Dolly back. It was as if she was possessed by some uncontainable rage, her small face twisted into an expression that was both heartbroken and furious. My wife and I tried to calm her down, to reason with her, but she wasn’t listening.



""Where’s Dolly?” she shrieked, her voice hoarse from crying. “You’ll regret this! Dolly’s going to hurt you! She’ll make you sorry! Give her back!”



Her words left a chill running through my veins. This wasn’t our daughter speaking, not the sweet, gentle child we’d raised. She’d always been polite, soft-spoken, never the kind of kid who threw tantrums or even raised her voice much. But now, she seemed almost feral, her eyes wild with an intensity that was… unnerving.



The tantrum went on for hours, our daughter’s screams echoing through the house, until she finally wore herself out. With her voice raw and every tear shed, she collapsed onto the couch, exhausted and half-asleep. My wife and I sat nearby, sharing exhausted, worried glances, feeling like we’d made a terrible mistake but unable to go back on our decision now. Once we were sure she was asleep, we carried her to her bed, laying her down gently and turning on her night light. We murmured soft goodnights, though we made sure not to wake her.



We thought the worst of it was over for the night, that we’d weathered the storm and could finally get a moment to breathe.



But when we walked back into the living room, a chill settled over me, prickling the back of my neck. My heart dropped when I saw it.



There, sitting on the couch in the exact spot where my daughter had just been sleeping, was Dolly. She sat upright, her button eyes fixed straight ahead, her stitched smile just a little too wide, too knowing. 



We stood there, frozen, staring at her in stunned silence. Neither of us had touched the doll since I’d hidden her in the pantry. There was no way she could have gotten back to the living room on her own.



My wife reached out, her hand trembling, as if to pick Dolly up, but then thought better of it and pulled her hand back, wrapping her arms around herself instead.



I could feel the words I wanted to say caught in my throat. Instead, I moved forward slowly, as if approaching something dangerous, and took Dolly in my hands, her fabric cold and somehow… heavier than before. I was careful not to look at her too closely, afraid that if I met those button eyes for too long, I’d see something I couldn’t unsee.



I brought her back to the pantry, stuffing her into the corner again, this time piling more cans in front of her, pushing them in tightly to make sure she wouldn’t move. I left the pantry, shutting the door firmly behind me.



When I returned to the living room, my wife was still standing there, her face pale. We didn’t say a word. We just sat there in silence, the weight of that empty stitched smile lingering in the room.



And as we sat there, I found myself thinking about my daughter’s words, her warning echoing in my mind: “Dolly’s going to hurt you. She’ll make you sorry.”



My wife and I sat on the couch, staring at each other, hearts pounding in our chests, with the realization that neither of us had moved Dolly from her hiding place in the pantry. We both knew it couldn’t have been our daughter, either; she’d been asleep the whole time. And yet… there was Dolly, sitting in the exact spot where our daughter had drifted off on the couch, like she’d claimed it as her own.



“This is too much,” my wife whispered, her voice shaky. “I don’t want that doll in the house anymore. Please, just… get rid of it.”



She looked at me with pleading eyes, and I couldn’t blame her. Every logical part of me wanted to dismiss what was happening, but that feeling—that lingering chill creeping down my spine—told me it was best to listen. I didn’t want Dolly here, either. Whatever this was, it needed to end.



I scooped Dolly up, feeling that unnatural heaviness in her again, like she was almost pulling me back, as if the doll didn’t want to leave. I ignored the way her stitched smile seemed to stretch just a little more as I turned toward the door, telling myself it was just a trick of my tired mind. I had to get her out.



Outside, the early morning was eerily quiet. The community dumpster stood at the far end of the lot, and I made my way over, clutching Dolly tight, every step feeling more difficult than the last. A weight, like icy fingers, seemed to wrap around my shoulders, tendrils of dread clawing at my chest. It was ridiculous; I knew it was just a doll, but it felt like something was whispering in my ear, urging me to stop. To turn around. To take Dolly back inside.



I shook it off, forcing myself to keep walking. When I reached the dumpster, I flung the lid open, staring into the dark, reeking void below. With a grimace, I tossed Dolly inside, hearing the muffled thud as she hit the bottom, then slammed the heavy lid shut with a sense of finality.



As I walked back to the house, a small but persistent voice in my mind whispered that this wasn’t over. But I pushed it down, reasoning that we’d done the right thing. Dolly was gone. Our daughter would be upset, but with some time, she’d move on.



The next morning, when our daughter woke up, her eyes darted around the room, searching, and she quickly realized Dolly was missing. Her face fell, and she looked up at me, desperation clouding her eyes. But this time, she was different. It was as though something in her understood, resigned and hurt. She didn’t throw a tantrum. She didn’t scream or demand Dolly back. She just sighed, shoulders slumped, and went about getting ready for school with a defeated sort of sadness.



“Promise to be good, okay?” I said, brushing her hair out of her face as she sat at the breakfast table. She nodded, though her gaze was fixed somewhere distant, somewhere I couldn’t follow.



After we got her on the bus and my wife headed to work, I finally allowed myself to relax. Maybe we’d done it, I thought. Maybe we’d finally won the battle.



I made myself a coffee, settled into my office, and powered up my laptop, planning to get some work done in the quiet house. The familiar hum of the computer and the routine of logging into emails and files felt comforting, ordinary. I let myself get lost in it, ignoring the lingering memories of the past few days, trying to embrace the calm.



But then, just as I was settling in, I heard it: a soft, drawn-out creak, like someone slowly pushing the door open. 



My heart froze. I looked up from my screen, eyes darting to the door. It was open, just a crack, though I distinctly remembered shutting it when I’d sat down.



“Hello?” I called, my voice barely more than a whisper, straining to listen for any sound in return. Nothing.



A chill ran down my spine as I pushed back from my desk, rising slowly, my eyes locked on that narrow sliver of the door, as if expecting something to appear there. I took a cautious step forward, reaching out to push the door wider, my breath caught in my throat.



And that’s when I saw it.



Sitting there, just outside my office, was Dolly.



She was propped up in the hallway, her button eyes fixed on the door, her head tilted just slightly, as if she were studying me. That stitched smile, wider than I remembered, curved in an expression that was almost… triumphant.



I stumbled back, feeling my stomach twist as that dreadful realization settled over me. I’d thrown her away. I’d *seen* her hit the bottom of that dumpster. But here she was, back in my house, waiting, like she’d never left.



Dolly sat there, covered in dirt, grime, and bits of garbage clinging to her black dress, her button eyes still fixed on me. For a moment, I could only stare, paralyzed by disbelief and dread. I took a step back, not even noticing the wall behind me until my shoulders hit it. I had thrown her away—*I had seen her at the bottom of that dumpster*. And yet, here she was, sitting on my hallway floor, filthy and somehow more sinister than ever.



Then, before I could even process what I was seeing, Dolly began to rise. Her small body lifted into the air, hovering just above the floor. The air felt thick, almost electric, like the whole house was holding its breath. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. 



Then, in a rush, a series of images flashed through my mind. Terrible, twisted visions filled my head—screaming faces, dark, tangled forests, and a sense of looming, inescapable dread. The world around me seemed to fade away, swallowed by shadows. My vision blurred, and in the next instant, I was no longer standing in my hallway.



I was in a forest, a dense, suffocating darkness pressing down on me from all sides. My heart pounded in my chest as I ran, my legs pumping through thick underbrush. My feet stumbled over roots and rocks, my lungs burning as I gasped for air. It was like being inside the worst kind of nightmare, but the terror was too real, too sharp to dismiss as mere fantasy. Something was behind me—*chasing* me.



I risked a glance over my shoulder, and my blood ran cold. A massive beast, towering and monstrous, loped through the shadows, its movements fluid but unnatural, as if its joints were barely holding together. It looked like a wolf, but larger than any wolf I’d ever seen, with a gaping maw that stretched grotesquely across its face, almost as if it were barely attached by a thin hinge of jaw. Its eyes burned a bright, unsettling red, like twin buttons sewn deep into its skull, and its body was held together with thick, fraying threads, giving it a twisted, stitched appearance that reminded me horribly of Dolly.



The beast let out a growl, and the sound was like a thousand voices, guttural and inhuman. I stumbled, my legs giving out beneath me as I crashed to the forest floor. The rancid smell of decay filled the air as the creature loomed over me, its hot, foul breath washing over my face. It was like staring into the face of a nightmare made real, a vision of pure, unfiltered terror.



I tried to push myself up, to run, but the beast was too fast. It lowered its massive head, baring rows of jagged, yellowed teeth, each one as sharp as a dagger. I braced my arms against its maw, desperate to hold it back, but the beast was impossibly strong. Black, oily ichor dripped from its mouth, splattering onto my arms and chest, the stench nearly choking me.



“*This isn’t real!*” I shouted, my voice breaking with desperation. “*Leave me alone!*”



But the creature’s glowing red eyes narrowed, and I felt a crushing weight as it bore down on me. Its teeth sunk into my shoulder, sending a wave of agony tearing through my body. I screamed, the pain sharp and cold, a raw fire spreading through my veins. I could feel its teeth tearing into me, feel the slick heat of blood as it spilled down my side.



With a surge of frantic energy, I brought my knee up, slamming it into the beast’s chest, trying to shove it back. But it barely budged. The creature’s maw twisted, a sick, twisted semblance of a grin, its red button eyes glinting with something almost… playful.



“*Wake up! WAKE UP!*” I yelled, every ounce of my mind focused on breaking free of this nightmare. I was trapped, I knew it, but I couldn’t give up. Images of my daughter, my wife, flashed before my eyes, filling me with a fierce determination. I couldn’t let this thing win. I couldn’t let it keep me here.



With a final scream, I pushed against the creature, throwing every ounce of strength I had into one last desperate shove. My body ached, my mind felt splintered, but I focused on them—on my family—on getting back to them. The creature’s grip loosened, if only slightly, and I clawed at the ground, digging my fingers into the dirt as I struggled to pull myself free.



I kept fighting, clinging to that small, stubborn spark of hope. And then, with a sudden, blinding flash, the forest disappeared. 



I found myself back in the hallway, Dolly lying lifeless on the ground in front of me. My head was spinning, still trapped somewhere between the nightmare forest and reality. But one sensation cut through the fog: a searing pain on my chest. I pressed my hand to it, feeling the strange, raw heat radiating from beneath my shirt.



With trembling hands, I pulled my shirt over my head and looked down. My skin was marked with thick, jagged scars—pale and twisted, like they’d been there for years. They traced the spot where the beast had sunk its teeth, a brutal reminder of what I had just endured, or maybe… *survived*.



I looked down at Dolly, her button eyes gazing blankly up at me, her face filled with that eerie, stitched grin. Rage bubbled up inside me, pushing past the confusion and horror of what had just happened. Enough was enough. This doll had wormed its way into my life, into my daughter’s mind, and I couldn’t let it haunt us any longer.



Without another thought, I scooped her up and strode to the garage. I grabbed a can of kerosene, nearly spilling it in my haste, and snatched a box of matches we kept for family fires in the backyard. Today, we’d be having a fire of a different kind.



The backyard was quiet, almost too quiet, as I made my way to the fire pit. I threw Dolly in, her soft body crumpling against the grate, and stuffed a few pieces of old newspaper around her. The doll’s face stared up at me, an almost pleading look in her button eyes. And then, out of nowhere, I felt it—*hesitation*. A nagging, sick feeling gnawed at me, a tiny voice in my head begging me to stop, like I was about to destroy something important, something I should cherish.



It was absurd, but the feeling was almost overwhelming, like Dolly herself was reaching into my mind, whispering to me, making me doubt.



*No*, I told myself. *She’s nothing. Just a doll.*



I shook off the creeping doubt, forcing my hands to steady as I unscrewed the kerosene cap and doused her, watching as the liquid soaked into her fabric, darkening the black dress and matting her tangled hair. With one last breath, I struck a match and, without hesitating further, tossed it in.



The flames roared to life, but instead of the usual red and orange, they flickered a strange, dark purple, licking over Dolly’s body with an otherworldly glow. I watched, transfixed, as her face seemed to contort within the flames, her button eyes bulging slightly, her smile twisting as if alive, fighting against the fire’s embrace. But I held firm, rooted to the spot, determined to watch until there was nothing left but ashes.



I sat there by the fire pit, ignoring the urgent pings of work emails and notifications from my laptop still inside. None of it mattered. Not right now. I stayed there, keeping vigil until the doll was nothing more than charred scraps, the purple flames fading into smoldering embers.



Hours later, when it was time to pick up my daughter from school, I finally stood up, feeling a strange mixture of relief and exhaustion. Dolly was gone, nothing more than a burnt heap. But the scars on my chest tingled, reminding me of the nightmare I couldn’t quite shake.



When I picked up my daughter from school that afternoon, she came running toward me, her face lighting up with that familiar, heartwarming grin. It was as if the past few weeks—the tantrums, the outbursts, the strange fixation on Dolly—had never happened. She wrapped her arms around my waist, her voice bubbling with excitement.



“Daddy! Guess what? I got a gold star on my spelling test! And we made clay animals in art today. Mine’s a bunny. I’ll bring it home to show you tomorrow!”



I hugged her back, feeling a weight lift from my shoulders. It was like having my little girl back, the bright, happy child I’d known before Dolly came into our lives. The darkness that had hung over her seemed to have vanished, leaving no trace, no lingering shadows. She didn’t ask about Dolly. She didn’t even seem to notice the doll was gone.



That night, as we sat down for dinner, she chattered about her day, telling us all the little details we’d missed, her laughter filling the house with warmth that had been absent for far too long. My wife and I exchanged relieved glances, finally allowing ourselves to believe that it was over.



Later, after our daughter was asleep, I told my wife everything. The nightmare in the forest, the scars on my chest, the way Dolly had been lying in the hallway, filthy and somehow… waiting. I explained how I’d taken her to the fire pit, how I’d watched the doll burn with those strange purple flames, staying there until I was sure every last piece of her was gone.



My wife listened, her expression shifting from shock to disbelief. I could tell she was skeptical, and who could blame her? I wasn’t sure I’d believe it myself if I hadn’t seen it all firsthand. But in the end, she squeezed my hand, her lips curving into a soft smile.



“Well, real or not,” she said, “I’m just glad that thing is gone. Our daughter’s back, and that’s what matters.”



I nodded, feeling the scars on my chest itch slightly under my shirt, something that will always remind me of the nightmare I’d lived through. But as I looked down the hall, hearing my daughter’s soft breathing from her room, I knew that we were finally safe.



Dolly was gone. Our daughter was free. And, for the first time in weeks, our home felt like ours again.

1gi5via,https://www.reddit.com/r/TimelessHorror/comments/1gi5via/i_think_my_daughters_doll_is_possessed/,I think my daughter's doll is possessed,"Thrift shopping had always been a sort of ritual for my wife and me. We’d hit up estate sales, thrift stores, garage sales, even old shops on their last legs, picking up whatever caught our eye to breathe new life into our home. Nearly everything around us had a story—things that, in their quiet way, had been through someone else’s life before they became part of ours. Cookware, furniture, our daughter’s toys, clothes—it didn’t matter. If it was well-made and had some years left, it was good enough for us.

Growing up the way we did, my wife and I both learned early on not to waste anything. We weren’t poor now, not by a long shot, but when you’ve spent your childhood stretching every dollar, that “waste-not” mentality never fully leaves. It’s more than a habit; it’s instinct.

I’d become something of a hawk for deals, tracking social media for those inevitable posts about local stores closing down, big sales, liquidations—anything with a shot at uncovering a hidden gem. It was like a hobby. And that’s how I found out about the toy store. An old post, buried deep on the community page, announced the auction of a local toy shop that had been a fixture in the town since the Great Depression.

The place was special. I’d been there once as a kid, and I remembered the almost magical feeling of the store—the smell of old wood and varnish, the glint of paint on row after row of handmade toys. This wasn’t your usual toy store. The owner, an older man everyone knew as Mr. Winslow, had poured his life into every toy, carving and painting each one by hand. Wooden soldiers, miniature dollhouses, delicate puzzles… everything you could imagine. He never imported a single thing, and every toy had a strange, vintage charm that you couldn’t find anywhere else.

Mr. Winslow and his wife had run the shop right up until they died, years apart. They didn’t have any family left, so the state had seized the property, and now they were auctioning everything off, right down to the last hand-carved toy. 

The sale was on a cold, gray Saturday. I convinced my wife it’d be worth checking out, maybe picking up a few toys for our daughter. The place was in rough shape, dim and drafty. Half the lights didn’t work, and the smell of dust lingered heavy in the air, clinging to everything like a veil. But the toys—they were immaculate. Each shelf was still filled with tiny wooden faces frozen in mid-expression, each toy glancing out at us, wide-eyed and almost… expectant. 

The crowd at the auction was familiar, dotted with faces I’d seen at sales like this before. Liquidation sales bring out a certain kind of person. You can always tell who’s a regular and who’s new to the scene just by watching them bid. The newcomers hesitate, test the waters before committing to any serious bid. But the regulars, the seasoned ones, they’ve got a rhythm. They know exactly how high to go, exactly when to pull back. Most of them aren’t there to pick up keepsakes; they’re there to flip it all for a profit online.

In most liquidation sales, they bundle the goods in bulk, which suits the resellers just fine. You see a table stacked with, say, a hundred of the same porcelain vase or unopened action figure; people bid on the lot, the highest bidder picks their fill, and then the next one steps up. It's efficient. By the end, whatever’s left just goes for the average bid price, first come, first serve.

But Mr. Winslow’s toy store wasn’t your average liquidation. No one was here for bulk toys from China, and no one was going to find a stack of hot-ticket items like last season’s electronics. Every item was unique, hand-crafted and individually priced. There wasn’t a single barcode in the building, not a plastic wrapper in sight. Every toy was a labor of love, something that had been sanded, painted, and assembled by hand. It was like stepping into a time capsule, each piece carrying a bit of the old man’s life and passion.

The toys looked like relics from another era: wooden horses with faded paint, lines of tin soldiers standing rigid, delicate porcelain dolls with blank, glassy eyes. There were marionettes on thin, tangled strings, and intricate dollhouses with hand-painted wallpaper and tiny furniture inside. Toys made for another world, another life. Most of the people there took one look and left early, their disinterest written all over their faces. These weren’t things that would sell for much online. And with the store’s gloomy atmosphere and the unsettling shadows cast by the dim light, I didn’t blame them.

But I was in it for more than a quick sale. I’d come to find a treasure, maybe something special to put on a shelf for our daughter or a keepsake to remind me of a place that had been in the town forever. So I stayed, wandering the aisles, running my fingers along the toys’ edges, feeling the worn, chipped paint under my fingers.

The auction had turned out to be a bust. I wandered around the store one last time, eyeing the shelves filled with dusty old toys, and I was just about ready to leave empty-handed when my daughter tugged on my sleeve.

“Daddy, look!”

She pointed to a battered old toy box shoved in a corner. Sitting upright inside it, propped against the side like she’d been carefully placed there, was a plush doll. But this wasn’t just any stuffed toy. The doll was eerily life-sized—just about the same height as my daughter, in fact. It had stringy blonde hair that cascaded messily down its shoulders, two large button eyes stitched onto a cloth face, and a stitched-on smile that seemed just a little too wide, curling up at the edges in a way that didn’t quite feel right. The doll wore a faded black dress with lace trimming, adding to its peculiar charm.

My daughter rushed over, her face lighting up with excitement. She plucked the doll from the toy box and hugged it tightly, like she’d found a long-lost friend. “Her name is Dolly!” she declared, squeezing the doll with the kind of fierce, unfiltered affection only a child can muster.

I looked at the doll more closely, a little unsettled by its fixed, button-eyed stare and that odd smile that seemed to follow me even as I shifted from side to side. There was something strange about its proportions, almost as if it had been crafted specifically to look like a child… but not quite.

The auctioneer, clearly tired of a morning spent trying to hawk dusty old toys to an uninterested crowd, noticed my interest and gave a half-hearted wave.

“Take it if you want,” he said with a shrug. “Ain’t nobody bidding on this junk. Most of it’s headed for the dump. You find anything else you like, feel free to pick through it. Won't cost you more than a few dollars.”

The truth was, there wasn’t anything else in that store I wanted, and after an auctioneer calls the merchandise “garbage,” it’s a good hint to leave. I paid him a few dollars for Dolly, who was now practically glued to my daughter’s side. She clutched the doll’s hand, looking at me with a beaming grin that melted any lingering doubts I might have had.

As we left, I noticed that my daughter was oddly quiet. Normally, she’d chatter all the way home, talking about every little thing she saw, but this time, she just held Dolly close, staring out the window with a sort of distant expression, almost like she was… listening. It was subtle, but it was there. I chalked it up to the thrill of her new toy, and figured she was probably just imagining adventures for Dolly, weaving stories in her head like she often did.

Still, something felt strange. I couldn’t shake the feeling that the doll’s stitched-on eyes were watching me, even as I drove, catching glimpses of it in the rearview mirror. And though my daughter was silent, there was a sort of tension in the car, a quiet that seemed to settle in like a chill.

We pulled into the driveway, and I glanced back at my daughter, who was still holding Dolly, her fingers entwined with the doll’s soft fabric hand. She looked up at me with a serene smile.

“She really likes it here, Daddy,” she whispered, as if Dolly herself had somehow told her.

The words sent a shiver down my spine. I told myself I was just being paranoid. After all, it was just a doll, a cheap, old-fashioned plush left over in a toy store no one cared about.

But as we stepped inside, I couldn’t help feeling we’d brought something else home with us that day, something that had been waiting patiently in that dusty corner, in a forgotten store full of discarded things. And now, it had found a new place to belong.

In the weeks that followed, my daughter’s attachment to Dolly grew into an obsession. At first, my wife and I thought it was adorable. Kids have imaginary friends all the time, right? And if she wanted to treat Dolly as her special friend, that seemed harmless enough. 

At any given moment, you could find my daughter playing with Dolly. She held tea parties for the two of them, setting up our good china in tiny rows on her play table. Dolly always had the seat of honor, perched across from my daughter, her button eyes staring straight ahead, her strange stitched smile ever-present.

When it wasn’t tea parties, it was “school.” My daughter would line up her other stuffed animals, but Dolly was always in the front row, right under her watchful eye. I’d hear her talking to Dolly, sometimes even scolding her in a low, serious voice, like she was dealing with a difficult student. She’d talk with Dolly while watching TV, telling her all the things that were happening on the screen as if the doll was hanging onto every word. We chalked it up to a vivid imagination.

But soon, things started to feel… different. I noticed my daughter no longer touched any of her other toys. They lay scattered around her room, gathering dust. Her entire world revolved around Dolly.

One evening, we sat down for dinner. It was spaghetti night, my daughter’s favorite, and my wife had gone all out. We called her to the table, expecting her to leave Dolly behind like usual. But tonight, she walked into the dining room, gripping Dolly by the arm, and carefully set her down on the chair next to her.

“Can Dolly have a plate too?” she asked, her voice full of a strange kind of insistence.

My wife and I exchanged a glance, an uneasy one. We both shrugged it off and played along, thinking it was just a phase. My wife set an empty plate in front of Dolly, miming a spoonful of spaghetti onto it with a playful smile.

But our daughter’s face fell, her expression crumpling as she stared down at the empty plate in front of Dolly.

“She needs real food, Mom,” she said, her voice small and hurt.

“Honey, she gets special pretend food, because she’s a pretend person,” my wife explained gently, trying to meet her halfway.

My daughter’s expression twisted into something dark and angry, a look we’d never seen from her before. Her face flushed, and her eyes filled with tears as she screamed, “No! Dolly hasn’t eaten in decades! She’s *hungry!*”

The words came out in a wail, raw and full of a desperate, gut-wrenching emotion that seemed so out of place. It was as if she was pleading for a real, living person, as though Dolly’s hunger was a tangible, undeniable fact. She grabbed the doll, cradling it protectively as if we had wronged it, her face red with frustration and hurt.

When we tried to calm her down, she started kicking, screaming, inconsolable. She clung to Dolly, her knuckles turning white, her small voice rising in a frantic, guttural cry that we’d never heard from her before. Eventually, we had no choice but to pick her up, gently prying her from Dolly’s side. She thrashed and shouted as we carried her to her room, leaving Dolly alone at the kitchen table.

As I closed her bedroom door, my heart still pounding from the outburst, I found myself staring back at the dining room. There sat Dolly, her button eyes unblinking, her crooked smile staring straight ahead as if mocking me.

The room felt quiet, too quiet, and as I stood there, I could’ve sworn I saw the faintest twitch in Dolly’s stitched mouth—a subtle shift, as if she were smiling just a bit wider. I shook it off, forcing myself to laugh at the absurdity of it. It was just a doll. Just fabric and stuffing.

But as I turned out the kitchen light, leaving Dolly in the darkness, I couldn’t shake the feeling that, somehow, she was still watching me.

It took a long time to calm our daughter down. She kept sniffling, wiping at her nose, and muttering how unfair it was that Dolly hadn’t been given food. She clutched at her pajamas, her small fists trembling with frustration and sorrow, saying she just wanted Dolly to be happy. My wife, always the peacemaker, gave me a gentle nudge.

""Just get the doll, please,"" she whispered, glancing back at our daughter. “It’ll help her calm down.”

I nodded, reluctantly heading back to the kitchen, feeling a strange knot forming in my stomach. As I walked into the room, an odd chill seeped into my skin, making me pause at the doorway.

Dolly wasn’t where we’d left her.

We had set her at the dinner table, facing her empty plate, exactly where my daughter had insisted. But now she was turned in her chair, her body rotated to face down the hallway—the hallway that led to my daughter’s room. Her button eyes seemed to glint in the dim light, her crooked smile somehow looking sharper, hungrier.

I shook my head, brushing off the unsettling feeling as a trick of the light. It was just a doll. Maybe the chair had shifted when my daughter thrashed in the dining room, and in the chaos, I just hadn’t noticed.

I picked Dolly up, her fabric cold against my skin, and carried her back to my daughter’s room. I stepped inside, and the moment my daughter saw Dolly in my hands, her face lit up, her eyes going wide with relief and joy. She jumped up, practically launching herself at me to grab her beloved doll. The way she held Dolly… it was like she was reuniting with a real friend, someone she’d been separated from for a lifetime.

“Thank you, Daddy,” she whispered, clutching Dolly tightly, pressing her cheek against the doll’s button-eyed face. My wife sat beside her on the bed, running her fingers through our daughter’s hair, soothing her. 

As the tension in the room faded, my daughter murmured something, barely a breath.

“What did you say, sweetie?” I asked, leaning closer.

She looked up at me, her face soft and serene, and repeated it, her voice clear. “Dolly’s full now.”

A shiver ran through me, but before I could think too much of it, she broke into a grin, her usual playful energy returning. “Can I watch TV now?”

My wife shot me a confused glance but quickly regained her composure. “After you eat your dinner, okay?”

Our daughter nodded, happily returning to the dining room to finish her meal. She didn’t ask about Dolly’s food, didn’t protest or insist on setting an extra plate. She ate without complaint, chattering occasionally about her favorite cartoons. The strange outburst over Dolly seemed forgotten, almost as if it hadn’t happened at all.

After dinner, she padded off to the living room and settled in front of the TV, Dolly perched beside her, her tiny hands still wrapped around the doll’s. We exchanged wary glances, but neither of us dared speak the questions lingering in our minds. The quiet in the house had returned, as if nothing unusual had happened at all.

That night, there were no more whispers about Dolly being hungry, no more outbursts or demands for extra plates at the table. My wife and I, unsure of what to make of it, decided to let it go. Whatever had happened, our daughter was calm, happy even. And if Dolly had something to do with that, well… we weren’t about to argue with a win.

That night, after we’d tucked our daughter into bed and cleaned up the kitchen, my wife and I sat together at the dining room table, mulling over the evening’s strange events.

""She’s eight now,” my wife said, her voice low, like she didn’t want to risk our daughter hearing, even though her room was on the other side of the house. “Isn’t she a little old to be pretending a doll is… well, *real*?”

I nodded, rubbing my temples. “I was thinking the same thing. I mean, she did this before, but back when she was really little—two or three, maybe. And even then, it wasn’t this intense.”

We’d both noticed that her behavior with Dolly was different than her usual flights of imagination. At that age, she’d had a few imaginary friends, nothing we worried about. She’d talk to her stuffed animals, play-act scenarios; it was normal stuff. But now, with Dolly, her behavior seemed… fervent. Like Dolly wasn’t just a doll she liked, but something essential, almost sacred to her.

“We could… maybe take the doll away?” I suggested, not liking the idea even as I said it.

My wife shook her head. “If we just took Dolly, she’d be inconsolable. And honestly, I don’t want another outburst like tonight. We’d have to handle it carefully.”

After a few minutes of back and forth, we came up with a plan: we’d gradually phase Dolly out. We’d get our daughter hooked on something new, a fun toy or playset she couldn’t resist, and once she’d lost interest in Dolly, we’d quietly take the doll away while she was at school.

But this plan was harder to execute than we thought.

We spent the next week scouring stores for the latest toys—something we usually avoided given our thrift-shop lifestyle. We bought dolls with accessories, elaborate playsets, building kits, anything we thought might catch her attention. We figured we’d splurge just this once if it meant keeping her happy and moving her away from Dolly.

Yet, no matter what we brought home, she barely looked at the new toys. Her enthusiasm was tepid, at best. She’d unwrap the new toy, inspect it with a polite sort of interest, and then inevitably wander back to wherever Dolly was waiting. My wife and I tried everything, even bringing home a new board game, hoping it’d be something we could play together as a family. But Dolly was always right there, tucked under my daughter’s arm or seated by her side, a silent companion with her button eyes and stitched smile, watching us from across the table.

Finally, in a last-ditch effort, we went out and bought her a tablet. We figured that with all the educational games, drawing apps, and videos at her fingertips, surely she’d be glued to it like most kids her age. But she barely gave it a second glance.

“Thanks, Mom and Dad,” she said when we handed it to her, but there was something distant in her eyes. She held Dolly close, almost protectively, her thumb tracing the doll’s tiny hand. “But… Dolly doesn’t like tablets.”

The words, though innocent enough, sent a chill down my spine. It was like she was speaking not for herself, but on behalf of her doll, as though Dolly had a voice, an opinion, a preference.

My wife and I exchanged worried glances. We’d tried everything, and it seemed our daughter’s attachment to Dolly was only deepening. She barely even touched the new toys; they lay untouched in her room, some still in their boxes, collecting dust.

With a heavy heart, we decided to go forward with our original plan. We would wait until she was at school, slip Dolly out of sight, and hope that, with enough new distractions around her, she’d find something else to latch onto. We both felt a pang of guilt—seeing the joy Dolly brought her, the way her face lit up when she held the doll, made it hard to imagine taking that away. But our concern for her well-being outweighed everything else.

So, we waited, biding our time, and hoped—hoped that, in Dolly’s absence, our daughter would turn her attention to one of the other toys.

But deep down, I had a feeling this wouldn’t go as smoothly as we hoped.

The night before we were set to pull off our plan, I had the strangest dream. At least, I *think* it was a dream.

I was lying in bed, staring up at the ceiling, when a chill crept over me. It felt like something was watching us, something cold and patient. I didn’t want to look, but in the way dreams force you, I felt my eyes drift toward the end of the bed. There, just at the edge of my vision, was Dolly. She was standing up, perfectly still, her button eyes fixed on me. I couldn’t make out any details—just her shadowy outline, a figure waiting silently, as if she had all the time in the world. Every time I tried to turn my head to look directly at her, she vanished, slipping back into the corner of my sight.

When I woke up, my heart was pounding, my skin damp with cold sweat. I shook it off, trying to convince myself it was just the stress of the past few weeks getting to me.

That morning, as planned, my wife took our daughter to school, distracting her with promises of a new game they’d play together that evening. The house felt unnaturally still once they were gone, a heavy silence that seemed to press against my skin.

I took a deep breath, heading into my daughter’s room, where Dolly was resting on her bed. Picking her up felt strange, like I was holding something more than just a doll. I avoided looking into those button eyes and quickly made my way to the pantry. I stuffed her into the top back corner, where my daughter wouldn’t think to look, carefully positioning her behind a stack of canned goods.

As expected, when my daughter came home and saw that Dolly was missing, all hell broke loose. The tantrum was unlike anything I’d ever seen. She stormed through the house, screaming, throwing things, demanding we give Dolly back. It was as if she was possessed by some uncontainable rage, her small face twisted into an expression that was both heartbroken and furious. My wife and I tried to calm her down, to reason with her, but she wasn’t listening.

""Where’s Dolly?” she shrieked, her voice hoarse from crying. “You’ll regret this! Dolly’s going to hurt you! She’ll make you sorry! Give her back!”

Her words left a chill running through my veins. This wasn’t our daughter speaking, not the sweet, gentle child we’d raised. She’d always been polite, soft-spoken, never the kind of kid who threw tantrums or even raised her voice much. But now, she seemed almost feral, her eyes wild with an intensity that was… unnerving.

The tantrum went on for hours, our daughter’s screams echoing through the house, until she finally wore herself out. With her voice raw and every tear shed, she collapsed onto the couch, exhausted and half-asleep. My wife and I sat nearby, sharing exhausted, worried glances, feeling like we’d made a terrible mistake but unable to go back on our decision now. Once we were sure she was asleep, we carried her to her bed, laying her down gently and turning on her night light. We murmured soft goodnights, though we made sure not to wake her.

We thought the worst of it was over for the night, that we’d weathered the storm and could finally get a moment to breathe.

But when we walked back into the living room, a chill settled over me, prickling the back of my neck. My heart dropped when I saw it.

There, sitting on the couch in the exact spot where my daughter had just been sleeping, was Dolly. She sat upright, her button eyes fixed straight ahead, her stitched smile just a little too wide, too knowing. 

We stood there, frozen, staring at her in stunned silence. Neither of us had touched the doll since I’d hidden her in the pantry. There was no way she could have gotten back to the living room on her own.

My wife reached out, her hand trembling, as if to pick Dolly up, but then thought better of it and pulled her hand back, wrapping her arms around herself instead.

I could feel the words I wanted to say caught in my throat. Instead, I moved forward slowly, as if approaching something dangerous, and took Dolly in my hands, her fabric cold and somehow… heavier than before. I was careful not to look at her too closely, afraid that if I met those button eyes for too long, I’d see something I couldn’t unsee.

I brought her back to the pantry, stuffing her into the corner again, this time piling more cans in front of her, pushing them in tightly to make sure she wouldn’t move. I left the pantry, shutting the door firmly behind me.

When I returned to the living room, my wife was still standing there, her face pale. We didn’t say a word. We just sat there in silence, the weight of that empty stitched smile lingering in the room.

And as we sat there, I found myself thinking about my daughter’s words, her warning echoing in my mind: “Dolly’s going to hurt you. She’ll make you sorry.”

My wife and I sat on the couch, staring at each other, hearts pounding in our chests, with the realization that neither of us had moved Dolly from her hiding place in the pantry. We both knew it couldn’t have been our daughter, either; she’d been asleep the whole time. And yet… there was Dolly, sitting in the exact spot where our daughter had drifted off on the couch, like she’d claimed it as her own.

“This is too much,” my wife whispered, her voice shaky. “I don’t want that doll in the house anymore. Please, just… get rid of it.”

She looked at me with pleading eyes, and I couldn’t blame her. Every logical part of me wanted to dismiss what was happening, but that feeling—that lingering chill creeping down my spine—told me it was best to listen. I didn’t want Dolly here, either. Whatever this was, it needed to end.

I scooped Dolly up, feeling that unnatural heaviness in her again, like she was almost pulling me back, as if the doll didn’t want to leave. I ignored the way her stitched smile seemed to stretch just a little more as I turned toward the door, telling myself it was just a trick of my tired mind. I had to get her out.

Outside, the early morning was eerily quiet. The community dumpster stood at the far end of the lot, and I made my way over, clutching Dolly tight, every step feeling more difficult than the last. A weight, like icy fingers, seemed to wrap around my shoulders, tendrils of dread clawing at my chest. It was ridiculous; I knew it was just a doll, but it felt like something was whispering in my ear, urging me to stop. To turn around. To take Dolly back inside.

I shook it off, forcing myself to keep walking. When I reached the dumpster, I flung the lid open, staring into the dark, reeking void below. With a grimace, I tossed Dolly inside, hearing the muffled thud as she hit the bottom, then slammed the heavy lid shut with a sense of finality.

As I walked back to the house, a small but persistent voice in my mind whispered that this wasn’t over. But I pushed it down, reasoning that we’d done the right thing. Dolly was gone. Our daughter would be upset, but with some time, she’d move on.

The next morning, when our daughter woke up, her eyes darted around the room, searching, and she quickly realized Dolly was missing. Her face fell, and she looked up at me, desperation clouding her eyes. But this time, she was different. It was as though something in her understood, resigned and hurt. She didn’t throw a tantrum. She didn’t scream or demand Dolly back. She just sighed, shoulders slumped, and went about getting ready for school with a defeated sort of sadness.

“Promise to be good, okay?” I said, brushing her hair out of her face as she sat at the breakfast table. She nodded, though her gaze was fixed somewhere distant, somewhere I couldn’t follow.

After we got her on the bus and my wife headed to work, I finally allowed myself to relax. Maybe we’d done it, I thought. Maybe we’d finally won the battle.

I made myself a coffee, settled into my office, and powered up my laptop, planning to get some work done in the quiet house. The familiar hum of the computer and the routine of logging into emails and files felt comforting, ordinary. I let myself get lost in it, ignoring the lingering memories of the past few days, trying to embrace the calm.

But then, just as I was settling in, I heard it: a soft, drawn-out creak, like someone slowly pushing the door open. 

My heart froze. I looked up from my screen, eyes darting to the door. It was open, just a crack, though I distinctly remembered shutting it when I’d sat down.

“Hello?” I called, my voice barely more than a whisper, straining to listen for any sound in return. Nothing.

A chill ran down my spine as I pushed back from my desk, rising slowly, my eyes locked on that narrow sliver of the door, as if expecting something to appear there. I took a cautious step forward, reaching out to push the door wider, my breath caught in my throat.

And that’s when I saw it.

Sitting there, just outside my office, was Dolly.

She was propped up in the hallway, her button eyes fixed on the door, her head tilted just slightly, as if she were studying me. That stitched smile, wider than I remembered, curved in an expression that was almost… triumphant.

I stumbled back, feeling my stomach twist as that dreadful realization settled over me. I’d thrown her away. I’d *seen* her hit the bottom of that dumpster. But here she was, back in my house, waiting, like she’d never left.

Dolly sat there, covered in dirt, grime, and bits of garbage clinging to her black dress, her button eyes still fixed on me. For a moment, I could only stare, paralyzed by disbelief and dread. I took a step back, not even noticing the wall behind me until my shoulders hit it. I had thrown her away—*I had seen her at the bottom of that dumpster*. And yet, here she was, sitting on my hallway floor, filthy and somehow more sinister than ever.

Then, before I could even process what I was seeing, Dolly began to rise. Her small body lifted into the air, hovering just above the floor. The air felt thick, almost electric, like the whole house was holding its breath. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. 

Then, in a rush, a series of images flashed through my mind. Terrible, twisted visions filled my head—screaming faces, dark, tangled forests, and a sense of looming, inescapable dread. The world around me seemed to fade away, swallowed by shadows. My vision blurred, and in the next instant, I was no longer standing in my hallway.

I was in a forest, a dense, suffocating darkness pressing down on me from all sides. My heart pounded in my chest as I ran, my legs pumping through thick underbrush. My feet stumbled over roots and rocks, my lungs burning as I gasped for air. It was like being inside the worst kind of nightmare, but the terror was too real, too sharp to dismiss as mere fantasy. Something was behind me—*chasing* me.

I risked a glance over my shoulder, and my blood ran cold. A massive beast, towering and monstrous, loped through the shadows, its movements fluid but unnatural, as if its joints were barely holding together. It looked like a wolf, but larger than any wolf I’d ever seen, with a gaping maw that stretched grotesquely across its face, almost as if it were barely attached by a thin hinge of jaw. Its eyes burned a bright, unsettling red, like twin buttons sewn deep into its skull, and its body was held together with thick, fraying threads, giving it a twisted, stitched appearance that reminded me horribly of Dolly.

The beast let out a growl, and the sound was like a thousand voices, guttural and inhuman. I stumbled, my legs giving out beneath me as I crashed to the forest floor. The rancid smell of decay filled the air as the creature loomed over me, its hot, foul breath washing over my face. It was like staring into the face of a nightmare made real, a vision of pure, unfiltered terror.

I tried to push myself up, to run, but the beast was too fast. It lowered its massive head, baring rows of jagged, yellowed teeth, each one as sharp as a dagger. I braced my arms against its maw, desperate to hold it back, but the beast was impossibly strong. Black, oily ichor dripped from its mouth, splattering onto my arms and chest, the stench nearly choking me.

“*This isn’t real!*” I shouted, my voice breaking with desperation. “*Leave me alone!*”

But the creature’s glowing red eyes narrowed, and I felt a crushing weight as it bore down on me. Its teeth sunk into my shoulder, sending a wave of agony tearing through my body. I screamed, the pain sharp and cold, a raw fire spreading through my veins. I could feel its teeth tearing into me, feel the slick heat of blood as it spilled down my side.

With a surge of frantic energy, I brought my knee up, slamming it into the beast’s chest, trying to shove it back. But it barely budged. The creature’s maw twisted, a sick, twisted semblance of a grin, its red button eyes glinting with something almost… playful.

“*Wake up! WAKE UP!*” I yelled, every ounce of my mind focused on breaking free of this nightmare. I was trapped, I knew it, but I couldn’t give up. Images of my daughter, my wife, flashed before my eyes, filling me with a fierce determination. I couldn’t let this thing win. I couldn’t let it keep me here.

With a final scream, I pushed against the creature, throwing every ounce of strength I had into one last desperate shove. My body ached, my mind felt splintered, but I focused on them—on my family—on getting back to them. The creature’s grip loosened, if only slightly, and I clawed at the ground, digging my fingers into the dirt as I struggled to pull myself free.

I kept fighting, clinging to that small, stubborn spark of hope. And then, with a sudden, blinding flash, the forest disappeared. 

I found myself back in the hallway, Dolly lying lifeless on the ground in front of me. My head was spinning, still trapped somewhere between the nightmare forest and reality. But one sensation cut through the fog: a searing pain on my chest. I pressed my hand to it, feeling the strange, raw heat radiating from beneath my shirt.

With trembling hands, I pulled my shirt over my head and looked down. My skin was marked with thick, jagged scars—pale and twisted, like they’d been there for years. They traced the spot where the beast had sunk its teeth, a brutal reminder of what I had just endured, or maybe… *survived*.

I looked down at Dolly, her button eyes gazing blankly up at me, her face filled with that eerie, stitched grin. Rage bubbled up inside me, pushing past the confusion and horror of what had just happened. Enough was enough. This doll had wormed its way into my life, into my daughter’s mind, and I couldn’t let it haunt us any longer.

Without another thought, I scooped her up and strode to the garage. I grabbed a can of kerosene, nearly spilling it in my haste, and snatched a box of matches we kept for family fires in the backyard. Today, we’d be having a fire of a different kind.

The backyard was quiet, almost too quiet, as I made my way to the fire pit. I threw Dolly in, her soft body crumpling against the grate, and stuffed a few pieces of old newspaper around her. The doll’s face stared up at me, an almost pleading look in her button eyes. And then, out of nowhere, I felt it—*hesitation*. A nagging, sick feeling gnawed at me, a tiny voice in my head begging me to stop, like I was about to destroy something important, something I should cherish.

It was absurd, but the feeling was almost overwhelming, like Dolly herself was reaching into my mind, whispering to me, making me doubt.

*No*, I told myself. *She’s nothing. Just a doll.*

I shook off the creeping doubt, forcing my hands to steady as I unscrewed the kerosene cap and doused her, watching as the liquid soaked into her fabric, darkening the black dress and matting her tangled hair. With one last breath, I struck a match and, without hesitating further, tossed it in.

The flames roared to life, but instead of the usual red and orange, they flickered a strange, dark purple, licking over Dolly’s body with an otherworldly glow. I watched, transfixed, as her face seemed to contort within the flames, her button eyes bulging slightly, her smile twisting as if alive, fighting against the fire’s embrace. But I held firm, rooted to the spot, determined to watch until there was nothing left but ashes.

I sat there by the fire pit, ignoring the urgent pings of work emails and notifications from my laptop still inside. None of it mattered. Not right now. I stayed there, keeping vigil until the doll was nothing more than charred scraps, the purple flames fading into smoldering embers.

Hours later, when it was time to pick up my daughter from school, I finally stood up, feeling a strange mixture of relief and exhaustion. Dolly was gone, nothing more than a burnt heap. But the scars on my chest tingled, reminding me of the nightmare I couldn’t quite shake.

When I picked up my daughter from school that afternoon, she came running toward me, her face lighting up with that familiar, heartwarming grin. It was as if the past few weeks—the tantrums, the outbursts, the strange fixation on Dolly—had never happened. She wrapped her arms around my waist, her voice bubbling with excitement.

“Daddy! Guess what? I got a gold star on my spelling test! And we made clay animals in art today. Mine’s a bunny. I’ll bring it home to show you tomorrow!”

I hugged her back, feeling a weight lift from my shoulders. It was like having my little girl back, the bright, happy child I’d known before Dolly came into our lives. The darkness that had hung over her seemed to have vanished, leaving no trace, no lingering shadows. She didn’t ask about Dolly. She didn’t even seem to notice the doll was gone.

That night, as we sat down for dinner, she chattered about her day, telling us all the little details we’d missed, her laughter filling the house with warmth that had been absent for far too long. My wife and I exchanged relieved glances, finally allowing ourselves to believe that it was over.

Later, after our daughter was asleep, I told my wife everything. The nightmare in the forest, the scars on my chest, the way Dolly had been lying in the hallway, filthy and somehow… waiting. I explained how I’d taken her to the fire pit, how I’d watched the doll burn with those strange purple flames, staying there until I was sure every last piece of her was gone.

My wife listened, her expression shifting from shock to disbelief. I could tell she was skeptical, and who could blame her? I wasn’t sure I’d believe it myself if I hadn’t seen it all firsthand. But in the end, she squeezed my hand, her lips curving into a soft smile.

“Well, real or not,” she said, “I’m just glad that thing is gone. Our daughter’s back, and that’s what matters.”

I nodded, feeling the scars on my chest itch slightly under my shirt, something that will always remind me of the nightmare I’d lived through. But as I looked down the hall, hearing my daughter’s soft breathing from her room, I knew that we were finally safe.

Hi all,

About 10 years ago I bought my wife this insane bong-looking contraption called ""The Dragon"" because she's a bit of a coffee snob. It was ""invented"" by the guy who started La Colombe, Todd Carmichael, and makes a good cup of coffee in my non-expert opinion. The only thing is I've used it maybe twice and she doesn't like to use it.

I'd like to sell it, but honestly not sure the best way to go about that. Ebay? Facebook marketplace? Drive over to my local coffee joint/brewery and try to trade it for beers?

Would baristas that nerd out on this stuff be interested?

I checked and I spent somewhere just south of $400 on it originally ten years ago because it was a limited run (yes I'm an idiot) but it's just been sitting at my house in its hard case gathering dust.

My wife LOVES coffee, it’s probably one of the only things she ever spends money on(syrups, foams, drizzles, new blends, starbucks and nice coffee shops, etc.). Thing is, we’ve been using the most normal coffee pots out there ranging from 20-60$. I have decided she’s going to have a coffee themed Christmas as far as present from me are concerned. I plan on having Beans, stirrers, and everything little in her stocking. But I want to have her bigger gifts be a Moccamaster, a grinder for the beans, and some other related items to making the best possible coffee at home. She likes brewing a pot or two a day or at least reheating the pot when she brews a big one. What all would be on your lists of must have items for someone who’s never owned or used one of these machines? Which model would you guys recommend and why?
Also I want to get her the nicest one I can without over spending so that I can afford to maybe extend the amounts of presents she has to open on Christmas morning (kids gotta see momma open a bunch of packages) is there a time/place I should be keeping my eyes open for a sale?

I am creating this topic to find some suitable advice and savvy people who can help to sort things out. Will be glad to receive any piece of useful advice.

1. So, about me: Male, single, 32 y.o. Living abroad now (in Warsaw) and receive a 1k USD scholarship till July next year.

My spending:

\- $700 for apartment rent with all utilities (very good price for studio-apartment in the central part of city, I would never change it to a dormitory or rent another place with other people to save money, I prefer living alone).

\- $200 monthly for food (October was the first month where I spent $200 for everything needed. I was eating well and already bought some huge packs of spaghetti, rice, olive oil etc - everything that might be used for months. Also, I cook at home 95% of time to avoid wasting money). So $200 for food without losing nutrition quality.

\- my transport card is covered by the scholarship.

\- and around $100 left is what I have left for savings.

2. Also, I have approximately counted my other expenses (around $250-300 monthly) - I go out because I like to socialize and meet with friends to grab a beer or two. Sometimes I go outside the city by train, so I buy tickets. Sometimes I might have unexpected costs, like having a coffee with someone. But, usually, I try to save when I can and don't make emotional buys of coffee/kebabs or smth like that. 95% of the time I buy what I really need or spend money when it makes sense.

3. I have around $1200 of savings in my bank account and around $1k in crypto.

4. Last 6 years I've been working as a freelancer in internet marketing, and I am well familiar with my field. Unfortunately, this doesn't give me money for the last year or so, because the freelance platform I've been working became real shit for freelancers. I have a stellar profile there with over 100 jobs finished but struggle finding projects there, because no one even opens my bids.

So, it turns out that I don't have any additional cash flow right now (however, I will continue bidding anyways) and my scholarship doesn't cover all my expenses. I can't get a job, because it is prohibited by contract, and the best way is to earn money by freelance, but it doesn't work.

Also, I don't want to continue working in the IT field and plan to change my specialty completely.

5. I am searching for some real advice of what I can do now to improve my financial situation, how to add new ways of earning some money, and how to act for the long-term perspective. Some savings advices are also appreciated.

I have plenty of free time, like 4 days a week.

Thank you!

P.S. I don't want to live from paycheck to paycheck. I want to create a cash flow, increase my savings and maybe buy a car in the future.",0,1730579950.0,eupersonalfinance,0,0.5,False
1gi5u8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gi5u8o/did_i_overreact_possible_emotional_affair/,Did I overreact? Possible emotional affair.,"I'm 29F and they're 38?NB. They're in a long-term, committed relationship.

We met at work in the summer of 2023. For me, it was a summer internship as part of my grad program. After, we kept in touch a little. We met up for coffee, and saw each other at some work-related events. In the spring of 2024, I started a new internship and they started volunteering there, so we saw each other frequently at that. We started hanging out more often, outside of work. In the summer of 2024, I broke it off with them because I felt really stressed out about our relationship crossing lines.

The entire time we were hanging out, and still up to today, I was never sure if our relationship was appropriate. I had a strong feeling that it wasn't, but, objectively nothing inappropriate happened. My friends had lots of different opinions about it. Some friends thought I was overreacting and it was all in my head. Other friends thought I was underreacting and I'd already seriously crossed some lines.

I'll list some things that made me feel like it wasn't kosher:

* They consistently gave me a lot of attention. Eye contact, body language, verbal. I didn't notice them doing this with others. It sometimes felt quite flirty at work, to the point where I was embarrassed. 
* For a long time, they wouldn't actually ask me to hang out, but would imply that they wanted me to ask them. I wondered if this was because they feel they shouldn't be asking. Eventually, they dropped it and started asking directly.
* They barely ever mentioned their partner, even when talking about things that must have involved her. I saw them do this in front of her, and she jumped in to say, ""And me. I was there too.""
* At my second internship, where they were volunteering, they frequently went out of their way to come and see me and talk to me. Eventually, our supervisor called them out, interrupting them and saying, ""Sorry, \[OP\] is busy with me."" They said, ""Lucky you."" After that, they'd still come and see me, but more briefly.
* They took me out for drinks for my birthday. I'm pretty sure they got me a stronger drink than the one I asked for. At the end, they said that they had been thinking about how they're ""too uptight"" because they ""hold themself to a higher standard than others"" and ""doubt their own motivations.""
* A couple of times, they brought up things that could have involved me going over to their place. I said no, because the reasons didn't make much sense.
* I started to wonder if the volunteer thing was a way to see me without telling their partner. When that ended, they mentioned several times that I should come meet them near their work for lunch. I told them that I didn't have transportation and they said they'd give me a ride, which made no sense logistically. I wondered if this idea was also so that they wouldn't have to tell their partner.
* At this point, I was feeling pretty bad about all this. I didn't contact them for a while. Then, I thought, ""Probably I'm reading into it. Their relationship isn't my business."" I hit them up for coffee. Their partner showed up in the middle, which was the first time I'd ever met her. They said, ""I didn't realize you were coming here"" to her and she didn't say anything back. Both of them seemed upset with each other. She left shortly after.
* I went to an event with them, their partner, their friends, and one of my friends. After, my friend immediately said, ""That was their partner? The vibes were weird, man"" and described their energy towards me as ""intense."" I actually thought they had been really toned-down, compared to usual. So even the toned-down version was noticeable.

After all this, I suddenly felt like I had normalized a lot of things over time. It really seemed like they were interested in me and acting on it. It seemed obvious that their partner wasn't OK with our relationship. I didn't understand why they didn't think this was a problem. But I thought it was a problem. This was all stressing me out big time, and I needed time and energy for other things.

I broke it off with them over text. I said that was saying goodbye because I was concerned about the boundaries and motivations on both sides, and I needed to focus on other things. They said that they ""totally support my decision to take whatever space works best for me.""

They never acknowledged the issue, never said what they think, never asked why I felt that way. It felt like they were implying maybe I don't have to break it off completely, but they weren't offering do anything to make that work for me. And they weren't willing to actually talk about any of this, so that it's all ""not their fault."" I asked if they want to talk about it more, and they said no. 

They could show their partner this text chain and it could 90% come off like I needed space because I had an unrequited crush on them. I felt frustrated but not surprised. I see why things aren't going well with their partner.

The reason I'm thinking about it again and wondering what to do is because our area of work is a small world. I ran into one of their close friends at a work thing yesterday. I'm applying for jobs, and they're connected to half of those opportunities. It's likely they would get contacted as a reference even though I don't put them down (this happened once, before I cut them off). It's possible we'd see each other at an upcoming work-related event.

I'm just not sure how to navigate it. It feels incredibly awkward. On the one hand, it would be so much easier if we could be on good terms in an appropriate way. I keep having the instinct to try to do that. But that's what I was trying to do this entire time. I don't think that's what they were going for.",1,1730579911.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

We’d hit up estate sales, thrift stores, garage sales, even old shops on their last legs, picking up whatever caught our eye to breathe new life into our home. Nearly everything around us had a story—things that, in their quiet way, had been through someone else’s life before they became part of ours. Cookware, furniture, our daughter’s toys, clothes—it didn’t matter. If it was well-made and had some years left, it was good enough for us.

Growing up the way we did, my wife and I both learned early on not to waste anything. We weren’t poor now, not by a long shot, but when you’ve spent your childhood stretching every dollar, that “waste-not” mentality never fully leaves. It’s more than a habit; it’s instinct.

I’d become something of a hawk for deals, tracking social media for those inevitable posts about local stores closing down, big sales, liquidations—anything with a shot at uncovering a hidden gem. It was like a hobby. And that’s how I found out about the toy store. An old post, buried deep on the community page, announced the auction of a local toy shop that had been a fixture in the town since the Great Depression.

The place was special. I’d been there once as a kid, and I remembered the almost magical feeling of the store—the smell of old wood and varnish, the glint of paint on row after row of handmade toys. This wasn’t your usual toy store. The owner, an older man everyone knew as Mr. Winslow, had poured his life into every toy, carving and painting each one by hand. Wooden soldiers, miniature dollhouses, delicate puzzles… everything you could imagine. He never imported a single thing, and every toy had a strange, vintage charm that you couldn’t find anywhere else.

Mr. Winslow and his wife had run the shop right up until they died, years apart. They didn’t have any family left, so the state had seized the property, and now they were auctioning everything off, right down to the last hand-carved toy. 

The sale was on a cold, gray Saturday. I convinced my wife it’d be worth checking out, maybe picking up a few toys for our daughter. The place was in rough shape, dim and drafty. Half the lights didn’t work, and the smell of dust lingered heavy in the air, clinging to everything like a veil. But the toys—they were immaculate. Each shelf was still filled with tiny wooden faces frozen in mid-expression, each toy glancing out at us, wide-eyed and almost… expectant. 

The crowd at the auction was familiar, dotted with faces I’d seen at sales like this before. Liquidation sales bring out a certain kind of person. You can always tell who’s a regular and who’s new to the scene just by watching them bid. The newcomers hesitate, test the waters before committing to any serious bid. But the regulars, the seasoned ones, they’ve got a rhythm. They know exactly how high to go, exactly when to pull back. Most of them aren’t there to pick up keepsakes; they’re there to flip it all for a profit online.

In most liquidation sales, they bundle the goods in bulk, which suits the resellers just fine. You see a table stacked with, say, a hundred of the same porcelain vase or unopened action figure; people bid on the lot, the highest bidder picks their fill, and then the next one steps up. It's efficient. By the end, whatever’s left just goes for the average bid price, first come, first serve.

But Mr. Winslow’s toy store wasn’t your average liquidation. No one was here for bulk toys from China, and no one was going to find a stack of hot-ticket items like last season’s electronics. Every item was unique, hand-crafted and individually priced. There wasn’t a single barcode in the building, not a plastic wrapper in sight. Every toy was a labor of love, something that had been sanded, painted, and assembled by hand. It was like stepping into a time capsule, each piece carrying a bit of the old man’s life and passion.

The toys looked like relics from another era: wooden horses with faded paint, lines of tin soldiers standing rigid, delicate porcelain dolls with blank, glassy eyes. There were marionettes on thin, tangled strings, and intricate dollhouses with hand-painted wallpaper and tiny furniture inside. Toys made for another world, another life. Most of the people there took one look and left early, their disinterest written all over their faces. These weren’t things that would sell for much online. And with the store’s gloomy atmosphere and the unsettling shadows cast by the dim light, I didn’t blame them.

But I was in it for more than a quick sale. I’d come to find a treasure, maybe something special to put on a shelf for our daughter or a keepsake to remind me of a place that had been in the town forever. So I stayed, wandering the aisles, running my fingers along the toys’ edges, feeling the worn, chipped paint under my fingers.

The auction had turned out to be a bust. I wandered around the store one last time, eyeing the shelves filled with dusty old toys, and I was just about ready to leave empty-handed when my daughter tugged on my sleeve.

“Daddy, look!”

She pointed to a battered old toy box shoved in a corner. Sitting upright inside it, propped against the side like she’d been carefully placed there, was a plush doll. But this wasn’t just any stuffed toy. The doll was eerily life-sized—just about the same height as my daughter, in fact. It had stringy blonde hair that cascaded messily down its shoulders, two large button eyes stitched onto a cloth face, and a stitched-on smile that seemed just a little too wide, curling up at the edges in a way that didn’t quite feel right. The doll wore a faded black dress with lace trimming, adding to its peculiar charm.

My daughter rushed over, her face lighting up with excitement. She plucked the doll from the toy box and hugged it tightly, like she’d found a long-lost friend. “Her name is Dolly!” she declared, squeezing the doll with the kind of fierce, unfiltered affection only a child can muster.

I looked at the doll more closely, a little unsettled by its fixed, button-eyed stare and that odd smile that seemed to follow me even as I shifted from side to side. There was something strange about its proportions, almost as if it had been crafted specifically to look like a child… but not quite.

The auctioneer, clearly tired of a morning spent trying to hawk dusty old toys to an uninterested crowd, noticed my interest and gave a half-hearted wave.

“Take it if you want,” he said with a shrug. “Ain’t nobody bidding on this junk. Most of it’s headed for the dump. You find anything else you like, feel free to pick through it. Won't cost you more than a few dollars.”

The truth was, there wasn’t anything else in that store I wanted, and after an auctioneer calls the merchandise “garbage,” it’s a good hint to leave. I paid him a few dollars for Dolly, who was now practically glued to my daughter’s side. She clutched the doll’s hand, looking at me with a beaming grin that melted any lingering doubts I might have had.

As we left, I noticed that my daughter was oddly quiet. Normally, she’d chatter all the way home, talking about every little thing she saw, but this time, she just held Dolly close, staring out the window with a sort of distant expression, almost like she was… listening. It was subtle, but it was there. I chalked it up to the thrill of her new toy, and figured she was probably just imagining adventures for Dolly, weaving stories in her head like she often did.

Still, something felt strange. I couldn’t shake the feeling that the doll’s stitched-on eyes were watching me, even as I drove, catching glimpses of it in the rearview mirror. And though my daughter was silent, there was a sort of tension in the car, a quiet that seemed to settle in like a chill.

We pulled into the driveway, and I glanced back at my daughter, who was still holding Dolly, her fingers entwined with the doll’s soft fabric hand. She looked up at me with a serene smile.

“She really likes it here, Daddy,” she whispered, as if Dolly herself had somehow told her.

The words sent a shiver down my spine. I told myself I was just being paranoid. After all, it was just a doll, a cheap, old-fashioned plush left over in a toy store no one cared about.

But as we stepped inside, I couldn’t help feeling we’d brought something else home with us that day, something that had been waiting patiently in that dusty corner, in a forgotten store full of discarded things. And now, it had found a new place to belong.

In the weeks that followed, my daughter’s attachment to Dolly grew into an obsession. At first, my wife and I thought it was adorable. Kids have imaginary friends all the time, right? And if she wanted to treat Dolly as her special friend, that seemed harmless enough. 

At any given moment, you could find my daughter playing with Dolly. She held tea parties for the two of them, setting up our good china in tiny rows on her play table. Dolly always had the seat of honor, perched across from my daughter, her button eyes staring straight ahead, her strange stitched smile ever-present.

When it wasn’t tea parties, it was “school.” My daughter would line up her other stuffed animals, but Dolly was always in the front row, right under her watchful eye. I’d hear her talking to Dolly, sometimes even scolding her in a low, serious voice, like she was dealing with a difficult student. She’d talk with Dolly while watching TV, telling her all the things that were happening on the screen as if the doll was hanging onto every word. We chalked it up to a vivid imagination.

But soon, things started to feel… different. I noticed my daughter no longer touched any of her other toys. They lay scattered around her room, gathering dust. Her entire world revolved around Dolly.

One evening, we sat down for dinner. It was spaghetti night, my daughter’s favorite, and my wife had gone all out. We called her to the table, expecting her to leave Dolly behind like usual. But tonight, she walked into the dining room, gripping Dolly by the arm, and carefully set her down on the chair next to her.

“Can Dolly have a plate too?” she asked, her voice full of a strange kind of insistence.

My wife and I exchanged a glance, an uneasy one. We both shrugged it off and played along, thinking it was just a phase. My wife set an empty plate in front of Dolly, miming a spoonful of spaghetti onto it with a playful smile.

But our daughter’s face fell, her expression crumpling as she stared down at the empty plate in front of Dolly.

“She needs real food, Mom,” she said, her voice small and hurt.

“Honey, she gets special pretend food, because she’s a pretend person,” my wife explained gently, trying to meet her halfway.

My daughter’s expression twisted into something dark and angry, a look we’d never seen from her before. Her face flushed, and her eyes filled with tears as she screamed, “No! Dolly hasn’t eaten in decades! She’s *hungry!*”

The words came out in a wail, raw and full of a desperate, gut-wrenching emotion that seemed so out of place. It was as if she was pleading for a real, living person, as though Dolly’s hunger was a tangible, undeniable fact. She grabbed the doll, cradling it protectively as if we had wronged it, her face red with frustration and hurt.

When we tried to calm her down, she started kicking, screaming, inconsolable. She clung to Dolly, her knuckles turning white, her small voice rising in a frantic, guttural cry that we’d never heard from her before. Eventually, we had no choice but to pick her up, gently prying her from Dolly’s side. She thrashed and shouted as we carried her to her room, leaving Dolly alone at the kitchen table.

As I closed her bedroom door, my heart still pounding from the outburst, I found myself staring back at the dining room. There sat Dolly, her button eyes unblinking, her crooked smile staring straight ahead as if mocking me.

The room felt quiet, too quiet, and as I stood there, I could’ve sworn I saw the faintest twitch in Dolly’s stitched mouth—a subtle shift, as if she were smiling just a bit wider. I shook it off, forcing myself to laugh at the absurdity of it. It was just a doll. Just fabric and stuffing.

But as I turned out the kitchen light, leaving Dolly in the darkness, I couldn’t shake the feeling that, somehow, she was still watching me.

It took a long time to calm our daughter down. She kept sniffling, wiping at her nose, and muttering how unfair it was that Dolly hadn’t been given food. She clutched at her pajamas, her small fists trembling with frustration and sorrow, saying she just wanted Dolly to be happy. My wife, always the peacemaker, gave me a gentle nudge.

""Just get the doll, please,"" she whispered, glancing back at our daughter. “It’ll help her calm down.”

I nodded, reluctantly heading back to the kitchen, feeling a strange knot forming in my stomach. As I walked into the room, an odd chill seeped into my skin, making me pause at the doorway.

Dolly wasn’t where we’d left her.

We had set her at the dinner table, facing her empty plate, exactly where my daughter had insisted. But now she was turned in her chair, her body rotated to face down the hallway—the hallway that led to my daughter’s room. Her button eyes seemed to glint in the dim light, her crooked smile somehow looking sharper, hungrier.

I shook my head, brushing off the unsettling feeling as a trick of the light. It was just a doll. Maybe the chair had shifted when my daughter thrashed in the dining room, and in the chaos, I just hadn’t noticed.

I picked Dolly up, her fabric cold against my skin, and carried her back to my daughter’s room. I stepped inside, and the moment my daughter saw Dolly in my hands, her face lit up, her eyes going wide with relief and joy. She jumped up, practically launching herself at me to grab her beloved doll. The way she held Dolly… it was like she was reuniting with a real friend, someone she’d been separated from for a lifetime.

“Thank you, Daddy,” she whispered, clutching Dolly tightly, pressing her cheek against the doll’s button-eyed face. My wife sat beside her on the bed, running her fingers through our daughter’s hair, soothing her. 

As the tension in the room faded, my daughter murmured something, barely a breath.

“What did you say, sweetie?” I asked, leaning closer.

She looked up at me, her face soft and serene, and repeated it, her voice clear. “Dolly’s full now.”

A shiver ran through me, but before I could think too much of it, she broke into a grin, her usual playful energy returning. “Can I watch TV now?”

My wife shot me a confused glance but quickly regained her composure. “After you eat your dinner, okay?”

Our daughter nodded, happily returning to the dining room to finish her meal. She didn’t ask about Dolly’s food, didn’t protest or insist on setting an extra plate. She ate without complaint, chattering occasionally about her favorite cartoons. The strange outburst over Dolly seemed forgotten, almost as if it hadn’t happened at all.

After dinner, she padded off to the living room and settled in front of the TV, Dolly perched beside her, her tiny hands still wrapped around the doll’s. We exchanged wary glances, but neither of us dared speak the questions lingering in our minds. The quiet in the house had returned, as if nothing unusual had happened at all.

That night, there were no more whispers about Dolly being hungry, no more outbursts or demands for extra plates at the table. My wife and I, unsure of what to make of it, decided to let it go. Whatever had happened, our daughter was calm, happy even. And if Dolly had something to do with that, well… we weren’t about to argue with a win.

That night, after we’d tucked our daughter into bed and cleaned up the kitchen, my wife and I sat together at the dining room table, mulling over the evening’s strange events.

""She’s eight now,” my wife said, her voice low, like she didn’t want to risk our daughter hearing, even though her room was on the other side of the house. “Isn’t she a little old to be pretending a doll is… well, *real*?”

I nodded, rubbing my temples. “I was thinking the same thing. I mean, she did this before, but back when she was really little—two or three, maybe. And even then, it wasn’t this intense.”

We’d both noticed that her behavior with Dolly was different than her usual flights of imagination. At that age, she’d had a few imaginary friends, nothing we worried about. She’d talk to her stuffed animals, play-act scenarios; it was normal stuff. But now, with Dolly, her behavior seemed… fervent. Like Dolly wasn’t just a doll she liked, but something essential, almost sacred to her.

“We could… maybe take the doll away?” I suggested, not liking the idea even as I said it.

My wife shook her head. “If we just took Dolly, she’d be inconsolable. And honestly, I don’t want another outburst like tonight. We’d have to handle it carefully.”

After a few minutes of back and forth, we came up with a plan: we’d gradually phase Dolly out. We’d get our daughter hooked on something new, a fun toy or playset she couldn’t resist, and once she’d lost interest in Dolly, we’d quietly take the doll away while she was at school.

But this plan was harder to execute than we thought.

We spent the next week scouring stores for the latest toys—something we usually avoided given our thrift-shop lifestyle. We bought dolls with accessories, elaborate playsets, building kits, anything we thought might catch her attention. We figured we’d splurge just this once if it meant keeping her happy and moving her away from Dolly.

Yet, no matter what we brought home, she barely looked at the new toys. Her enthusiasm was tepid, at best. She’d unwrap the new toy, inspect it with a polite sort of interest, and then inevitably wander back to wherever Dolly was waiting. My wife and I tried everything, even bringing home a new board game, hoping it’d be something we could play together as a family. But Dolly was always right there, tucked under my daughter’s arm or seated by her side, a silent companion with her button eyes and stitched smile, watching us from across the table.

Finally, in a last-ditch effort, we went out and bought her a tablet. We figured that with all the educational games, drawing apps, and videos at her fingertips, surely she’d be glued to it like most kids her age. But she barely gave it a second glance.

“Thanks, Mom and Dad,” she said when we handed it to her, but there was something distant in her eyes. She held Dolly close, almost protectively, her thumb tracing the doll’s tiny hand. “But… Dolly doesn’t like tablets.”

The words, though innocent enough, sent a chill down my spine. It was like she was speaking not for herself, but on behalf of her doll, as though Dolly had a voice, an opinion, a preference.

My wife and I exchanged worried glances. We’d tried everything, and it seemed our daughter’s attachment to Dolly was only deepening. She barely even touched the new toys; they lay untouched in her room, some still in their boxes, collecting dust.

With a heavy heart, we decided to go forward with our original plan. We would wait until she was at school, slip Dolly out of sight, and hope that, with enough new distractions around her, she’d find something else to latch onto. We both felt a pang of guilt—seeing the joy Dolly brought her, the way her face lit up when she held the doll, made it hard to imagine taking that away. But our concern for her well-being outweighed everything else.

So, we waited, biding our time, and hoped—hoped that, in Dolly’s absence, our daughter would turn her attention to one of the other toys.

But deep down, I had a feeling this wouldn’t go as smoothly as we hoped.

The night before we were set to pull off our plan, I had the strangest dream. At least, I *think* it was a dream.

I was lying in bed, staring up at the ceiling, when a chill crept over me. It felt like something was watching us, something cold and patient. I didn’t want to look, but in the way dreams force you, I felt my eyes drift toward the end of the bed. There, just at the edge of my vision, was Dolly. She was standing up, perfectly still, her button eyes fixed on me. I couldn’t make out any details—just her shadowy outline, a figure waiting silently, as if she had all the time in the world. Every time I tried to turn my head to look directly at her, she vanished, slipping back into the corner of my sight.

When I woke up, my heart was pounding, my skin damp with cold sweat. I shook it off, trying to convince myself it was just the stress of the past few weeks getting to me.

That morning, as planned, my wife took our daughter to school, distracting her with promises of a new game they’d play together that evening. The house felt unnaturally still once they were gone, a heavy silence that seemed to press against my skin.

I took a deep breath, heading into my daughter’s room, where Dolly was resting on her bed. Picking her up felt strange, like I was holding something more than just a doll. I avoided looking into those button eyes and quickly made my way to the pantry. I stuffed her into the top back corner, where my daughter wouldn’t think to look, carefully positioning her behind a stack of canned goods.

As expected, when my daughter came home and saw that Dolly was missing, all hell broke loose. The tantrum was unlike anything I’d ever seen. She stormed through the house, screaming, throwing things, demanding we give Dolly back. It was as if she was possessed by some uncontainable rage, her small face twisted into an expression that was both heartbroken and furious. My wife and I tried to calm her down, to reason with her, but she wasn’t listening.

""Where’s Dolly?” she shrieked, her voice hoarse from crying. “You’ll regret this! Dolly’s going to hurt you! She’ll make you sorry! Give her back!”

Her words left a chill running through my veins. This wasn’t our daughter speaking, not the sweet, gentle child we’d raised. She’d always been polite, soft-spoken, never the kind of kid who threw tantrums or even raised her voice much. But now, she seemed almost feral, her eyes wild with an intensity that was… unnerving.

The tantrum went on for hours, our daughter’s screams echoing through the house, until she finally wore herself out. With her voice raw and every tear shed, she collapsed onto the couch, exhausted and half-asleep. My wife and I sat nearby, sharing exhausted, worried glances, feeling like we’d made a terrible mistake but unable to go back on our decision now. Once we were sure she was asleep, we carried her to her bed, laying her down gently and turning on her night light. We murmured soft goodnights, though we made sure not to wake her.

We thought the worst of it was over for the night, that we’d weathered the storm and could finally get a moment to breathe.

But when we walked back into the living room, a chill settled over me, prickling the back of my neck. My heart dropped when I saw it.

There, sitting on the couch in the exact spot where my daughter had just been sleeping, was Dolly. She sat upright, her button eyes fixed straight ahead, her stitched smile just a little too wide, too knowing. 

We stood there, frozen, staring at her in stunned silence. Neither of us had touched the doll since I’d hidden her in the pantry. There was no way she could have gotten back to the living room on her own.

My wife reached out, her hand trembling, as if to pick Dolly up, but then thought better of it and pulled her hand back, wrapping her arms around herself instead.

I could feel the words I wanted to say caught in my throat. Instead, I moved forward slowly, as if approaching something dangerous, and took Dolly in my hands, her fabric cold and somehow… heavier than before. I was careful not to look at her too closely, afraid that if I met those button eyes for too long, I’d see something I couldn’t unsee.

I brought her back to the pantry, stuffing her into the corner again, this time piling more cans in front of her, pushing them in tightly to make sure she wouldn’t move. I left the pantry, shutting the door firmly behind me.

When I returned to the living room, my wife was still standing there, her face pale. We didn’t say a word. We just sat there in silence, the weight of that empty stitched smile lingering in the room.

And as we sat there, I found myself thinking about my daughter’s words, her warning echoing in my mind: “Dolly’s going to hurt you. She’ll make you sorry.”

My wife and I sat on the couch, staring at each other, hearts pounding in our chests, with the realization that neither of us had moved Dolly from her hiding place in the pantry. We both knew it couldn’t have been our daughter, either; she’d been asleep the whole time. And yet… there was Dolly, sitting in the exact spot where our daughter had drifted off on the couch, like she’d claimed it as her own.

“This is too much,” my wife whispered, her voice shaky. “I don’t want that doll in the house anymore. Please, just… get rid of it.”

She looked at me with pleading eyes, and I couldn’t blame her. Every logical part of me wanted to dismiss what was happening, but that feeling—that lingering chill creeping down my spine—told me it was best to listen. I didn’t want Dolly here, either. Whatever this was, it needed to end.

I scooped Dolly up, feeling that unnatural heaviness in her again, like she was almost pulling me back, as if the doll didn’t want to leave. I ignored the way her stitched smile seemed to stretch just a little more as I turned toward the door, telling myself it was just a trick of my tired mind. I had to get her out.

Outside, the early morning was eerily quiet. The community dumpster stood at the far end of the lot, and I made my way over, clutching Dolly tight, every step feeling more difficult than the last. A weight, like icy fingers, seemed to wrap around my shoulders, tendrils of dread clawing at my chest. It was ridiculous; I knew it was just a doll, but it felt like something was whispering in my ear, urging me to stop. To turn around. To take Dolly back inside.

I shook it off, forcing myself to keep walking. When I reached the dumpster, I flung the lid open, staring into the dark, reeking void below. With a grimace, I tossed Dolly inside, hearing the muffled thud as she hit the bottom, then slammed the heavy lid shut with a sense of finality.

As I walked back to the house, a small but persistent voice in my mind whispered that this wasn’t over. But I pushed it down, reasoning that we’d done the right thing. Dolly was gone. Our daughter would be upset, but with some time, she’d move on.

The next morning, when our daughter woke up, her eyes darted around the room, searching, and she quickly realized Dolly was missing. Her face fell, and she looked up at me, desperation clouding her eyes. But this time, she was different. It was as though something in her understood, resigned and hurt. She didn’t throw a tantrum. She didn’t scream or demand Dolly back. She just sighed, shoulders slumped, and went about getting ready for school with a defeated sort of sadness.

“Promise to be good, okay?” I said, brushing her hair out of her face as she sat at the breakfast table. She nodded, though her gaze was fixed somewhere distant, somewhere I couldn’t follow.

After we got her on the bus and my wife headed to work, I finally allowed myself to relax. Maybe we’d done it, I thought. Maybe we’d finally won the battle.

I made myself a coffee, settled into my office, and powered up my laptop, planning to get some work done in the quiet house. The familiar hum of the computer and the routine of logging into emails and files felt comforting, ordinary. I let myself get lost in it, ignoring the lingering memories of the past few days, trying to embrace the calm.

But then, just as I was settling in, I heard it: a soft, drawn-out creak, like someone slowly pushing the door open. 

My heart froze. I looked up from my screen, eyes darting to the door. It was open, just a crack, though I distinctly remembered shutting it when I’d sat down.

“Hello?” I called, my voice barely more than a whisper, straining to listen for any sound in return. Nothing.

A chill ran down my spine as I pushed back from my desk, rising slowly, my eyes locked on that narrow sliver of the door, as if expecting something to appear there. I took a cautious step forward, reaching out to push the door wider, my breath caught in my throat.

And that’s when I saw it.

Sitting there, just outside my office, was Dolly.

She was propped up in the hallway, her button eyes fixed on the door, her head tilted just slightly, as if she were studying me. That stitched smile, wider than I remembered, curved in an expression that was almost… triumphant.

I stumbled back, feeling my stomach twist as that dreadful realization settled over me. I’d thrown her away. I’d *seen* her hit the bottom of that dumpster. But here she was, back in my house, waiting, like she’d never left.

Dolly sat there, covered in dirt, grime, and bits of garbage clinging to her black dress, her button eyes still fixed on me. For a moment, I could only stare, paralyzed by disbelief and dread. I took a step back, not even noticing the wall behind me until my shoulders hit it. I had thrown her away—*I had seen her at the bottom of that dumpster*. And yet, here she was, sitting on my hallway floor, filthy and somehow more sinister than ever.

Then, before I could even process what I was seeing, Dolly began to rise. Her small body lifted into the air, hovering just above the floor. The air felt thick, almost electric, like the whole house was holding its breath. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. 

Then, in a rush, a series of images flashed through my mind. Terrible, twisted visions filled my head—screaming faces, dark, tangled forests, and a sense of looming, inescapable dread. The world around me seemed to fade away, swallowed by shadows. My vision blurred, and in the next instant, I was no longer standing in my hallway.

I was in a forest, a dense, suffocating darkness pressing down on me from all sides. My heart pounded in my chest as I ran, my legs pumping through thick underbrush. My feet stumbled over roots and rocks, my lungs burning as I gasped for air. It was like being inside the worst kind of nightmare, but the terror was too real, too sharp to dismiss as mere fantasy. Something was behind me—*chasing* me.

I risked a glance over my shoulder, and my blood ran cold. A massive beast, towering and monstrous, loped through the shadows, its movements fluid but unnatural, as if its joints were barely holding together. It looked like a wolf, but larger than any wolf I’d ever seen, with a gaping maw that stretched grotesquely across its face, almost as if it were barely attached by a thin hinge of jaw. Its eyes burned a bright, unsettling red, like twin buttons sewn deep into its skull, and its body was held together with thick, fraying threads, giving it a twisted, stitched appearance that reminded me horribly of Dolly.

The beast let out a growl, and the sound was like a thousand voices, guttural and inhuman. I stumbled, my legs giving out beneath me as I crashed to the forest floor. The rancid smell of decay filled the air as the creature loomed over me, its hot, foul breath washing over my face. It was like staring into the face of a nightmare made real, a vision of pure, unfiltered terror.

I tried to push myself up, to run, but the beast was too fast. It lowered its massive head, baring rows of jagged, yellowed teeth, each one as sharp as a dagger. I braced my arms against its maw, desperate to hold it back, but the beast was impossibly strong. Black, oily ichor dripped from its mouth, splattering onto my arms and chest, the stench nearly choking me.

“*This isn’t real!*” I shouted, my voice breaking with desperation. “*Leave me alone!*”

But the creature’s glowing red eyes narrowed, and I felt a crushing weight as it bore down on me. Its teeth sunk into my shoulder, sending a wave of agony tearing through my body. I screamed, the pain sharp and cold, a raw fire spreading through my veins. I could feel its teeth tearing into me, feel the slick heat of blood as it spilled down my side.

With a surge of frantic energy, I brought my knee up, slamming it into the beast’s chest, trying to shove it back. But it barely budged. The creature’s maw twisted, a sick, twisted semblance of a grin, its red button eyes glinting with something almost… playful.

“*Wake up! WAKE UP!*” I yelled, every ounce of my mind focused on breaking free of this nightmare. I was trapped, I knew it, but I couldn’t give up. Images of my daughter, my wife, flashed before my eyes, filling me with a fierce determination. I couldn’t let this thing win. I couldn’t let it keep me here.

With a final scream, I pushed against the creature, throwing every ounce of strength I had into one last desperate shove. My body ached, my mind felt splintered, but I focused on them—on my family—on getting back to them. The creature’s grip loosened, if only slightly, and I clawed at the ground, digging my fingers into the dirt as I struggled to pull myself free.

I kept fighting, clinging to that small, stubborn spark of hope. And then, with a sudden, blinding flash, the forest disappeared. 

I found myself back in the hallway, Dolly lying lifeless on the ground in front of me. My head was spinning, still trapped somewhere between the nightmare forest and reality. But one sensation cut through the fog: a searing pain on my chest. I pressed my hand to it, feeling the strange, raw heat radiating from beneath my shirt.

With trembling hands, I pulled my shirt over my head and looked down. My skin was marked with thick, jagged scars—pale and twisted, like they’d been there for years. They traced the spot where the beast had sunk its teeth, a brutal reminder of what I had just endured, or maybe… *survived*.

I looked down at Dolly, her button eyes gazing blankly up at me, her face filled with that eerie, stitched grin. Rage bubbled up inside me, pushing past the confusion and horror of what had just happened. Enough was enough. This doll had wormed its way into my life, into my daughter’s mind, and I couldn’t let it haunt us any longer.

Without another thought, I scooped her up and strode to the garage. I grabbed a can of kerosene, nearly spilling it in my haste, and snatched a box of matches we kept for family fires in the backyard. Today, we’d be having a fire of a different kind.

The backyard was quiet, almost too quiet, as I made my way to the fire pit. I threw Dolly in, her soft body crumpling against the grate, and stuffed a few pieces of old newspaper around her. The doll’s face stared up at me, an almost pleading look in her button eyes. And then, out of nowhere, I felt it—*hesitation*. A nagging, sick feeling gnawed at me, a tiny voice in my head begging me to stop, like I was about to destroy something important, something I should cherish.

It was absurd, but the feeling was almost overwhelming, like Dolly herself was reaching into my mind, whispering to me, making me doubt.

*No*, I told myself. *She’s nothing. Just a doll.*

I shook off the creeping doubt, forcing my hands to steady as I unscrewed the kerosene cap and doused her, watching as the liquid soaked into her fabric, darkening the black dress and matting her tangled hair. With one last breath, I struck a match and, without hesitating further, tossed it in.

The flames roared to life, but instead of the usual red and orange, they flickered a strange, dark purple, licking over Dolly’s body with an otherworldly glow. I watched, transfixed, as her face seemed to contort within the flames, her button eyes bulging slightly, her smile twisting as if alive, fighting against the fire’s embrace. But I held firm, rooted to the spot, determined to watch until there was nothing left but ashes.

I sat there by the fire pit, ignoring the urgent pings of work emails and notifications from my laptop still inside. None of it mattered. Not right now. I stayed there, keeping vigil until the doll was nothing more than charred scraps, the purple flames fading into smoldering embers.

Hours later, when it was time to pick up my daughter from school, I finally stood up, feeling a strange mixture of relief and exhaustion. Dolly was gone, nothing more than a burnt heap. But the scars on my chest tingled, reminding me of the nightmare I couldn’t quite shake.

When I picked up my daughter from school that afternoon, she came running toward me, her face lighting up with that familiar, heartwarming grin. It was as if the past few weeks—the tantrums, the outbursts, the strange fixation on Dolly—had never happened. She wrapped her arms around my waist, her voice bubbling with excitement.

“Daddy! Guess what? I got a gold star on my spelling test! And we made clay animals in art today. Mine’s a bunny. I’ll bring it home to show you tomorrow!”

I hugged her back, feeling a weight lift from my shoulders. It was like having my little girl back, the bright, happy child I’d known before Dolly came into our lives. The darkness that had hung over her seemed to have vanished, leaving no trace, no lingering shadows. She didn’t ask about Dolly. She didn’t even seem to notice the doll was gone.

That night, as we sat down for dinner, she chattered about her day, telling us all the little details we’d missed, her laughter filling the house with warmth that had been absent for far too long. My wife and I exchanged relieved glances, finally allowing ourselves to believe that it was over.

Later, after our daughter was asleep, I told my wife everything. The nightmare in the forest, the scars on my chest, the way Dolly had been lying in the hallway, filthy and somehow… waiting. I explained how I’d taken her to the fire pit, how I’d watched the doll burn with those strange purple flames, staying there until I was sure every last piece of her was gone.

My wife listened, her expression shifting from shock to disbelief. I could tell she was skeptical, and who could blame her? I wasn’t sure I’d believe it myself if I hadn’t seen it all firsthand. But in the end, she squeezed my hand, her lips curving into a soft smile.

“Well, real or not,” she said, “I’m just glad that thing is gone. Our daughter’s back, and that’s what matters.”

I nodded, feeling the scars on my chest itch slightly under my shirt, something that will always remind me of the nightmare I’d lived through. But as I looked down the hall, hearing my daughter’s soft breathing from her room, I knew that we were finally safe.

Dolly was gone. Our daughter was free. And, for the first time in weeks, our home felt like ours [again](https://www.reddit.com/user/LCDatkin/).",7,1730579850.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

They had an awesome interior design coffee table book that had featured some specific design philosophies and visuals I loved. They don’t remember the book. Here’s what sticks out in my memory:

1. One featured designer took inspiration from a child’s crayon marks and extended the playfulness throughout the living room using color and toy-like but still adult decor (think metal paper airplanes)throughout to facilitate a sense of fun and play in the eclectic space. 

2. Another designer or client brought in textures and patterns of the Souk in Marrakesh and other travel-trinkets into the space to intentionally evoke a sense of curiosity and escape. Images I remember included ornate tiling, walls plastered with varied grain thickness, playful fabrics)

3. Another aimed to bring restoration and retreat to a bedroom environment, bringing in a monotone color pallet and varied textures to create an almost spa-like feel to the space.

I can’t remember the book but I loved it so much and desperately want to buy it. Anyone know what book I’m talking about? Please help sate this decades-long book craving!",2,1730579643.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

Buy the ticket, take the ride...and if it occasionally gets a little heavier than what you had in mind, well...maybe chalk it up to forced consciousness expansion: Tune in, freak out, get beaten.” ― Hunter S. Thompson, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

(1) \[C.2019\]

""You broke the rule, Patton"", She says as if she is justice made manifest, if that could also sound flirtatious. Yeah, that's exactly how she sounds. I know she wants me to turn around, I know she wants me to respond with something more than, ""Nic! pretend we're in public and you don't know me."" She laughs, much to my surprise and sits down.

Nicole is still exceptionally beautiful; she always has been. Her 5ft 6in, frame adorned in a batman shirt, blond hair and I think yoga shorts. She's been on the road, I see. Seeing is to consider, that she is more beautiful than the last time we dreamt together. Pleasent, and/or sexy thoughts have a way of getting overshadowed quickly with our kind. Overshadowed by our reality, the reality of pleasantness at 4:30am. What a joke and let's face it. Sex, means nothing between two people who haven't slept in days. Almost overrated when you consider the dread found in post coital bliss.

Built different, the kids would say. That is a lot of bullshit in my opinion. Most like us, like Nic and I, just don't make it. Some become reckless and depressed. Some like her, consider us special and unique amongst the others. Maybe she's right. There is no free will to this. Just drive free time and hopefully and soon, sleep.

She is here! Not a hallucination, I can smell her; Key Lime Pie the one and only.

She tracked me, no way could this be random. 'The Tigar' is open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week and 361 days a year, no alcohol. Curious in why, she is at least two hundred and seventy miles away from any place she might call home. We have no business, and I never said I would follow their rules, blindly or with any degree of loyalty. The packs made us targets. Tribes created orgies; the decadence, greed and consumption corrupted every elemental bond between all of us. Some became Wendigo.

Today it's Uncia or Crawlers; regionalized, and situationally very territorial. Most go insane by thirty, some get into drugs and sex. Some like Nicole and I, try it all and then again do some more. Only to return back to this existence. She's here and all I can really think of is, fuck I need a drink...

Balance in all things. Balance is my peace; the balance is my rest.

She sits in front of me as she casually gathers her Malbroro Reds pack and pulls out a smoke. Her gracious and passive movements intrigue me. She hasn't looked in my face yet. She's been here watching me, for some time. Recalling how she closed the distance in equal strides, no wasted movement. A woman crawler is rare; well maybe not rare, but ones with and in positions of power, almost none. Worse, we have a history and a future. Neither able to deny what we really are. She is working up to something, there's tension all over her. Her Diet Dr. Pepper shows up, as if it was pre-ordered. It probably was.

She has a problem, and it's not just with me.

I grab a joint out of my pocket and reach for the lighter. She beats me to it, snatches it and slaps my hand with a swift gentle firmness; ""wait your turn, I never smoke in the car; how've you been?"" I almost believed her sincerity in the question. The thought brought a smile to my face, ""why are you here, how's Lance?"" I don't expect an answer, I just needed a slight distraction a small surprise can deliver. It worked, I swiftly swing my left hand, to snatch the lighter. Just after she lit the tip and with perfect timing, she will think later. I grab the lit cigarette with my right hand with atter like accuracy. Her hustler's smile is infectious, I take her first drag and hand it back.

""Balance in all things, Nic. You remember right? Speaking of, when will you learn to break the rules""? She drops her head, her tension changes. She pulls me deeper, in mind and spirit. We begin to really speak. ""You broke the rule, the only fucking rule! He's furious and has sent me to 'promote' you"". She casts my mind to images of sink holes in the middle of vast ocean deserts, and a family stranded on the side of the road. I send her their smell, peanut Butter and Oranges. She stops, opens her eyes wide. She is really trying to concentrate paining to each attention and every detail. She begins to cry, I was too aggressive, she needs to finish the thought.

I see snap shots, fast and aggressive but not with force. It was hurting her, that same family murdered, abused and tortured. Except not all of them, one was missing, which one? I couldn't remember and she began to speak. ""Patton, the oranges were masking the other smell, the real smell is underneath! Don't you see, I mean smell or, something, fuck!"" I close my eyes and take a deep drag and hold it in...

I am back to that moment I pulled over, reliving it as I begin to exhale. Driving through Arizona, the family the flat tire no spare. I remember the smells and now I remember them all, gasoline. ""The oldest boy, he is the one?"" I open my eyes and confirm. Exhaling the moment to bring her back into total focus. She seems surprised and more than a little relieved, ""Yes, in two or maybe three days. East Texas, you were supposed to take care of it that night and this, fuck Pat. This all feels gross, wrong and and"", before she can say it, I finish her sentence, ""like a trap"", ""Exactly and you're walking right into it"". She stops talking, I make no protest.

Moments pass, I think through it to nod subtly; ""Yeah, I'll leave tonight. Be there in a day, scout and go from there. I am not a contract killer Nic. If he can live, I will see to it. Those are my rules, Lance can go fuck himself or come and get me."". The words hung in the air. Leaving both of us thinking through what shouldn't happen next.

She said nothing at first, ""Listen Lance supports that, but you NEED to be certain Patton. You are a killer, we all are. If he does this later, it could put us all at risk"". I nodded less subtly. Hence the trap, I think openly. As a tear falls from her left blue eye.

The only matter left was the bill and it's time to go, I muse. I take another deep drag and put my joint away. I can see the true her again, as always and as before. ""I've been well, Nic. How've you been?"" She thinks and shyly responds, ""very much awake and seeing you around"". I smile to stand up, and toss two twenty-dollar bills on the table.

Thinking back, I could have said more; but this is likely a trap. We both know it and neither of us is immortal. So, I send her the smell of sausage and eggs; hashbrowns and morning juice. Move her to the smell of the morning dawn. I see her succumb to the warm coffee brewing in the background. That Sunday morning every detail, I left nothing out, in her waking dream. I'm gone, before she remembers that she doesn't smoke in the car and lights up another. Whispers to herself, for the road.",2,1730579607.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1gi5py9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DandysWorld_/comments/1gi5py9/my_headcanon_about_every_twisted/,My headcanon about every twisted,"i’ve stated a lot of these before, but here they are in a list.

Poppy: Anxiety caused her to twist. Her normal character always seemed anxious, and maybe she couldn’t control it one day.

Boxten: Loneliness. His reliance on others protection must have stopped at some point, his feelings bottled in his head. The ichor let him spew those emotions out of his head, giving others a perspective on his fear of being alone.

Cosmo: I think he thought he was not good enough, His idle animation shows him shaking his head in regret, as if “I should have never done that…” I think this is linked to either not being a good enough baker or being rejected by sprout some way or another.

Shrimpo: He was always a douche, i think dandy offered him ichor to “get back at the others”.

Tisha: I don’t have strong headcanons about tisha. I think she was either infected by dandy, or bitten by twisted shrimpo. Ooh, this brings me to another point. I think most the twisteds were infected by dandy or another infected (Shrimpo potentially being patient zero)

Brightney: Not bitten, but DOUSED in ichor. all the ichor is at the top of brightney’s head. She definitely didn’t have any trauma.

Finn: probably got captured by dandy and completely drained of water and replaced by ichor.

Razzle and dazzle: dazzle seems to look the more sane of the two. It seems as if they can keep together mentally when holding the brick. Razzle got bit first, dazzle tried to fight the ichor, grounded them both with the brick, and then got bitten. 

Rodger: he seems to shush toons that he kills, as if he’s saying goodnight. I think he doesn’t knows what’s happened, therefore killing all things that step in his eyesight because his eye is extremely disfigured from ichor. I think he was dropped in a tank then contained. He was then dropped in a room, he sits under the floor, semi choking, until a capsule opens and he’s forced out by pressure. 

Teagen: Thought the ichor was coffee. drank it. Look at the ichor splashed around her mouth. I also think she continues to feed off of other toons, as ichor grows on fresh mass.

Toodles: Simply got shot in the head and implanted deep with ichor. Probably found rodger and thought he was sane.

Flutter: Got hit by finn. Doused, bitten and angry. Patrols the halls for the person who took her diary. Still thinks the diary is the cause to her being targeted.

Gigi: I’m not sure yet.

Glisten: Definetly was at the tea party when teagen got infected. He also drunk a bit, but because he’s too fancy, he only took a small sip. Runs around looking for the sanest person. Similar to a boosted toon (wasteland au) but because of his low tolerance he couldn’t save himself.

Goob: probably went to reassure shrimpo that everythings ok. Got bit, ichor took control of his thoughts, and was fed all the bad thoughts. That, or he has pyrovision and thinking hugging people is good.

Scraps: was somewhere else and got the news that goob had twisted. Probably ran to him to see for herself. she probably kept telling herself that it was all fake and that goob was alright. Hugged goob, and then got bit by shrimpo (shrimpo took advantage of this, goob temporarily felt actual remorse while twisted. Now she seeks vengeance on the ichor producer, except she thinks everyone is that person.

Astro: The dreams turned worse and worse. Ichor appeared in his dreams long before anyone knew of it. He asked everyone about the ‘sentient ink’. Ended up chasing his dreams and found the source of the ichor. didn’t tell anyone. He left it alone and went about his life. All of a sudden, he saw people abusing that same liquid. He felt so guilty for not telling anyone. After being im

Shelly: either shrimpo or shelly was patient zero. I think shelly was so fed up with being ignored she drank ichor to get attention knowing that she would twist.

Vee: infected by one of the other mains. The ichor didn’t 100% of her programming, which is why we see her in the popups still. The popups for the toons obviously don’t appear on their face, instead they appear on the tv’s (excluding the Stage with razzle and dazzle) 

pebble: Accidental twisting. Dandy had wanted to keep pebble safe, but because he had experimented with the ichor so much pebble couldn’t go anywhere without stepping in a small puddle of the stuff. Pebble himself didn’t want this to happen, so the ichor grew off of him instead of inside him. It expanded to his body, then his legs and tail. A spike of ichor then rocketed to his head, causing him to finally go delusional

sprout: felt guilty for cosmo’s twisting. Blames it on dandy. Roams the halls chasing anyone due to thinking they are mocking either his new form of the fact that he caused cosmo to lose himself.

I am creating this topic to find some suitable advice and savvy people who can help to sort things out. Will be glad to receive any piece of useful advice.

1. So, about me: Male, single, 32 y.o. Living abroad now (in Warsaw) and receive a 1k USD scholarship till July next year. 

My spending:

\- $700 for apartment rent with all utilities (very good price for studio-apartment in the central part of city, I would never change it to a dormitory or rent another place with other people to save money, I prefer living alone).

\- $200 monthly for food (October was the first month where I spent $200 for everything needed. I was eating well and already bought some huge packs of spaghetti, rice, olive oil etc - everything that might be used for months. Also, I cook at home 95% of time to avoid wasting money). So $200 for food without losing nutrition quality.

\- my transport card is covered by the scholarship.

\- and around $100 left is what I have left for savings.

2. Also, I have approximately counted my other expenses (around $250-300 monthly) - I go out because I like to socialize and meet with friends to grab a beer or two. Sometimes I go outside the city by train, so I buy tickets. Sometimes I might have unexpected costs, like having a coffee with someone. But, usually, I try to save when I can and don't make emotional buys of coffee/kebabs or smth like that. 95% of the time I buy what I really need or spend money when it makes sense.

3. I have around $1200 of savings in my bank account and around $1k in crypto. 

4. Last 6 years I've been working as a freelancer in internet marketing, and I am well familiar with my field. Unfortunately, this doesn't give me money for the last year or so, because the freelance platform I've been working became real shit for freelancers. I have a stellar profile there with over 100 jobs finished but struggle finding  projects there, because no one even opens my bids.

So, it turns out that I don't have any additional cash flow right now (however, I will continue bidding anyways) and my scholarship doesn't cover all my expenses. I can't get a job, because it is prohibited by contract, and the best way is to earn money by freelance, but it doesn't work.

Also, I don't want to continue working in the IT field and plan to change my specialty completely.

5. I am searching for some real advice of what I can do now to improve my financial situation, how to add new ways of earning some money, and how to act for the long-term perspective. Some savings advices are also appreciated.

I have plenty of free time, like 4 days a week.

Thank you!  


P.S. I don't want to live from paycheck to paycheck. I want to create a cash flow, increase my savings and maybe buy a car in the future.",1,1730579510.0,MiddleClassFinance,1,0.67,False

When I moved in first I was too scared to knock on the door next door as the car was never there until late in the evenings like after 10.30pm so I left a card and candy to introduce myself. My neighbor knocked on the door a few days later and we had a nice chat. He seemed really nice and I invited him in after a few minutes of chatting at the door for coffee but he said he had to collect someone but another time. 

He is very good looking and I know he is single as he uses dating apps. We have similiar hobbies and backgrounds and I feel if I could have a good conversation with him we could see whether there is potential there. I have developed a massive crush on him and from my side would very much like to see if there could be any potential. He regularly appears on them and then seems to delete them again after a short space of time. I have once swiped right on him as I wanted to make a move (id prefer it to happen naturally when he is next door) but while it didn't come up as a match, this was after months of seeing him on there so he could have previously swiped on me and we wouldn't have matched then either as he has regularly deleted and reset.

I rarely see him as he seems to leave later or earlier than me in the mornings and comes home at different times. So it's hard to accidently on purpose bump into him. When I pass him in the car he always waves. I know my neighbors that know him describe him as shy and unassuming. 

He had someone in painting his garden fence a few months ago and that gave me the idea about a month later I should do mine so I did. Then he put a prompt on a dating app that he is looking for someone who likes painting garden fences. Co incidence or just referring to himself? So men play these games? And like a day later he disappeared again from the apps...

I feel like I really want to make a move or something. I'm scared to knock on his door and can't think of any excuse and I'm scared I will annoy him or he is not interested. Im thinking of asking him to help me move furniture upstairs but so scared to knock on the door. Would this be a good idea? Or should I try something else?
 I'm terrified he will meet someone while I'm still thinking about it and I will regret I never took a shot.
 And I know people will say it's risky when he is the neighbor but I don't want to regret what I didn't try.

He had a massive drinking problem, and was constantly drunk or hungover.

One night I was playing with my little sister, when she accidentally bumped into the coffee table. My dad immediately looked over at me, and started yelling at me that I should be more responsible. I’m pretty sure he even hit me. I was too overwhelmed, so I ended up running to my room and just crying in bed. At some point my mother must have been called (my parents are divorced) because she had arrived and tried to comfort me. I ended up going home with her, and said I didn’t want to see him anymore. So I haven’t.

Anyways, back to the original point of this post, I’ve recently been having flashbacks to that night and a few other bad nights, and it’s really taken a toll on me. I’ve told some of my friends the brief version of what he did to me, but no one knows the full story except for me. 

Is this PTSD, or is it just a normal thing that comes with trauma?",1,1730579280.0,ptsd,2,1.0,False

TL;DR My friends/coworkers keep buying me stuff and I feel guilty because I'm don't have enough money to spend back on them. 

My two friends/coworkers keep buying stuff for me and while I do appreciate it, it also stresses me out cause I am not doing well financially.  I live alone in a one bedroom apartment so its just me paying. My two friends live with their family or their significant other so they have extra money to spend since they split bills. 

With that money, they always buy me and each other breakfast tacos or snacks from the store. Hell last week all three of us all dressed up for Halloween at work from Mon- Thur and I didn't buy any of the props and additions for our outfits we already had in our closets. They did. Another thing is about , it threw me off cause about two weeks before Halloween , they wanted to make Halloween baskets for our whole team. It threw me off cause Ive never had friends who wanted to spend their money on a team of people. It also irritated me because I wasnt financially stable and was wondering how I was supposed to help with this. I did end up helping a little bit but even that little bit left me stressed. Almost feels like Im trying to fit in to their money spending friendship. Plus they are closer to each other than me anyway and they are the ones who come up with cool suggestions for holidays and such (all involving spending money of course.)

 The reason it's so stressful is because obviously if a friend is buying you stuff, it would make sense to buy them stuff too. However im not financially stable and only have enough money for myself. Sometimes I feel awkward coming into work with a coffee or taco and don't offer them anything because I can only afford one for me, not three. The only thing ive spent my money on with them is: I helped a bit to buy some candy for the baskets for our team at work, and I also bought one of my friends dresses for our costume because she forgot her card at home. I stepped up and offered to pay and they even looked at each other funny which stressed me out even more. ",1,1730579127.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I’m 33, 6’0”, and call Maine home. Grew up here, surrounded by more trees than people. At 180 pounds (usually a bit lighter, but let’s not get into my snack habits), I’ve got a laid-back vibe and a love for life’s quirkier side.

About me:

	•	Vibe: I lean toward a unique style, a blend of dark humor with a twist that’s a little Gothic. I’m all about finding the irony in life and appreciating the humor in unexpected places. You’ll find me laughing at horror movies or seeing the absurd side of things. If you’re someone who can laugh at life and doesn’t take things too seriously, I think we’ll get along.
	•	Interests: I’m a fan of comedy and horror, and I’m on my PS5 whenever I get the chance, taking on all challengers in Call of Duty. Into movies or games? Awesome. Not your thing? That’s cool, too. I love getting into new hobbies and exploring what other people are passionate about.

Bonus: I make a pretty mean breakfast. Sundays are for great food—think pancakes, bacon, and good coffee. If lazy weekends sound like your thing, we might just be on the same page.

What I’m looking for:

	•	Real Connection: I’m drawn to women who are direct, real, and up for meaningful conversations. Whether it’s sharing what we both enjoy or introducing each other to something new, I’m all in. Quick wit and a good laugh go a long way with me.
	•	Effort: I think showing up and putting in the energy is a game-changer. I’d rather skip endless texts and try a voice or video chat—it’s just more real and engaging. If you’re up for a bit of spontaneity, who knows what we’ll get up to?
	•	Open to Differences: I’m not looking for someone exactly like me. I think some variety keeps things interesting. We’ll never run out of things to talk about, and there’s always something new to learn from each other.

The Basics:

	•	I’m stable, independent, and have my life together, and I’m hoping you do too. I find it super attractive when someone’s driven and handles their own life well. I’m cool with long-distance if we click, so wherever you are, let’s see if there’s a connection.

I’d love to find someone to explore new places with, whether it’s a quirky cafe, a haunted trail, or a hidden gem around town. If you’re down for adventure, a bit of humor, and maybe some breakfast along the way, let’s connect and see where it goes.

Recently, it’s been pulling really bad shots and I can’t figure out what the problem is. To be honest, I don’t know much about coffee machines so I wanted to post on here in case anyone has dealt with this issue before. The issue is it doesn’t get into the “espresso range” when I’m pouring a shot and results in an undrinkable espresso 😭 I’ve attached photos of the grind amount and the courseness level but I can’t seem to attach a video of the shot being poured (it ends up looking super thin and doesn’t have any foam on top). 

Just FYI:
- it’s been cleaned (with a cleaning tablet) recently, but I can clean it again if that could be the issue 
- the beans I’m using are from a local bakery and they’re dry, not oily and we’ve been using them for a really long time and haven’t had this issue.

1gi5ap4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gi5ap4/aita_for_cutting_ties_with_my_best_friend_after/,AITA for cutting ties with my best friend after he touched me in my sleep?,"Hello, sorry I have no clue if this needs a TW or anything as I never posted on Reddit before, but I've been feeling so confused and stressed out about this situation I needed to get advice from outside people.

So I (26F) and ""B"" (26M) have been very close friends for more than a decade. We were in high school together, have a group of close friends, been on holidays, etc. He also lives very close from my apartment so we often han out at each other's place to work, grab coffee etc.

Last weekend B was hosting a party which I went to, and everything was fine there. At around 3am I was feeling extremely tired and wanted to go to sleep - however I didn't want to go back home by myself at such a time (my neighborhood can be a bit ""shady"" at night). So I asked my friend if I could sleep at his place, and he told me that it was fine. We've already slept in the same bed before as we've been friends for so long so obviously I didn't think anything of it.
So I went to bed while other people were partying downstairs, and after some time (I was already asleep by them) B joined me. He was on the phone with a girl so the talking woke me up, and after hanging up he told me that he and this girl were into each other but they couldn't be together blah blah blah, so I did feel for him, we talked about it for 5mn and I tried comforting him. Then he went to bed and we did hug to fall asleep, which I also don't find odd because we are used to hugging and it never has a **physical** undertone.

I fell asleep, and after god knows how long I woke up to him caressing my body quite inappropriately, which immediately made me freeze of fear and shame. I was completely paralyzed with shock and felt so ashamed that I couldn't bring myself to talk, so I didn't move and kept my eyes shut as if nothing was going on. But after a few seconds/minutes? he started sliding his hand in my underwear. At that moment I completely jumped and removed his hand and lashed out. I asked him why he would do this and he started talking all confusingly like ""omg sorry what did i just do i don't remember i don't know what's going on"". This whole thing triggered me as well as i've been SA'ed in the past so I started having a huge panic attack. 

B did acknowledge that what happened was not normal, did apologize and did help me while I was having a panic attack, however since then I've been feeling terrible and I told him after a day that I didn't want to be friends anymore and didn't want to have a discussion to hear his explanation (as he requested), as it did trigger me a lot and I couldn't picture a future where I would feel comfortable with him or even have him re gain my trust. I've talked a bit with two friends about it, they do feel sorry for me but they're also talking about how B is feeling miserable and that it was a ""mistake"" from his part. B sent me a message again and told me that he was drunk and very confused and that he didn't think that I was asleep. But to me it's pretty easy to notice when someone is receptive vs when they're sleeping? From some conversations that I had with friends, I am getting a feeling that they believe I am going too far and blowing it out of proportion. However I did keep it very low key, told almost no one and ""parted ways"" a way that was transparent and not agressive at all. I didn't put much blame on him and acknowledge that he may have been in a daze (although it actually doesn't justify anything to me?). 

So my question is, AITA here? Should I give him a bit more grace and try at least to have a discussion with him to hear what he has to say, and am I ""exaggerating""? I just feel like no matter which state you are in, touching someone else is unacceptable, and not something that should ever cross anyone's mind? ",11,1730578435.0,AITAH,46,0.82,False

I was an AVID coffee drinker before my pregnancy. During pregnancy, limiting myself to 200 to 300 mg of caffiene has been really hard, especially with this brutal exhaustion. I'd make myself a cup in the morning and then struggle to get to mid day so I could have a second cup. The majority of my afternoons I napped. I would crash, and crash hard. Napping was just was non-negotiable. I'm 12+4 and was hoping I would start getting some energy back, but I wasn't. 

One random day I was craving a cup of black tea with a small amount of milk and sugar. I went out and bought a pack. First, the tea was so much easier on my stomach. Coffee smells would randomly make me so nauseous and give me the worst sour stomach, but I pushed through for the energy. Now with tea I have significantly less acid reflux. 

As a volume drinker, tea intrigued me because it has less caffiene per fl oz. Now I can drink more tea, spread throughout the day. I don't have to fight to get to my second cup. Because there is less caffiene per fl oz I also feel like tea gives me a more steady, calm, and prolonged energy. No more wide awake and crash. Tea also has some other compounds that help you feel more gradually awake, and helps you feel the caffiene at a more sustained pace than a quick jolt. 

I seriously have not had to take a nap in the last four days since switching to tea. Sure some of it could be timing, but I always was a high sleep needs person and enjoyed a good nap before pregnancy.

If you're a coffee drinker and are struggling, I highly suggest trying black tea! I know it seems so obvious but in my sleep deprived pregnancy induced brain fog state it was like a eureka moment!",9,1730578261.0,pregnant,12,1.0,False
