1hsl4lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diverticulitis/comments/1hsl4lf/recurring_nightmare_and_long_ass_recovery/,Recurring nightmare and long ass recovery! ,"Diagnosed with Diverticulitis in June. Ended up in hospital for 7 days on a drip then surgery to drain an abscess due to perforation.

Since then, had numerous small flares, not needing ER. Didn't follow much of a strict diet, but do drink alot of alcohol (weekend binger) and coffee.

Anyways, I recently went for a second opinion with a surgeon to see why I'm still consistently getting small flares. Do CT scan, no new perforations, but he did say I was seriously inflamed and have serious diverticulitis. He said I should operate asap. I declined because I felt that was drastic.

No jokes, the following week I end up in ER with a hardcore flare, sweating, nausea, dizzy you know the story.

That was 11 December and since then, I've been on antibiotics and still not right. Constant mild pain, fatigue and bad reactions to food and coffee. No fever though.

Has anyone else taken over a month to recover from a bad flare on antibiotics? 

This is insane, I'm seriously considering resection surgery.

Last question, has anyone learned to live with this without needing surgery. Avoiding future flares needing ER?

Just looking for a good chat as I'm not sleepy enough for bed but also not motivated enough for anything else. Open to all sorts of conversations, ranting about work/family to discussing/creating wild conspiracy theories, from sharing life stories to pictures of interesting trees/graffiti/anything else. 

I'm a working professional. Outside of work, I volunteer, exercise, visit local markets, cook, binge on horror/psych thriller movies/shows, and read. I can easily pick up a random topic to talk about, but my main interests include fitness, exercise, finance, and cooking. I love coffee, straight up black with nothing else (except water... Boiling water!). Dark jokes are welcome. I enjoy learning about people's life experiences and perspectives on different things. I'm genuinely good at listening too for when you need to vent. 

I'm open to all locations, relationship statuses, employment statuses, native languages, ages, ethnicities, religions, etc. As long as we can hold a good conversation and vibe well, that's all that matters. A big plus would be if we share the total despise for ghosting too 👻

So you're here, that means you're as sick of the dating scene's shallowness as I am! I'm a 30 year old nerdy/geeky Mechanical Engineer who enjoys gaming and adventures, and also the master of late night drives to the middle of nowhere!

About Me: I'm not your average Joe. I prefer conversations about geeky stuff and conspiracy theories over the weather, I'm also a massive coffee addict and 420 safe!

What I Seek: A woman who's up for cracking bad jokes as much as listening to them, debating the merits of pineapple on pizza, and maybe even embarking on spontaneous adventures (like exploring that sketchy-looking woods down the street).

Why You Should Hit Me Up: If you're tired of swiping left on boring bios and are ready to dive into the weird and wonderful world of genuine connection, then let's chat! Who knows, we might just discover we're both secretly wizards or have a shared passion for collecting campervan money boxes.

So, if you're ready to add a splash of quirkiness to your life and see where it takes us, shoot me a message with your name, a pic of yourself, and the worst dad joke you can think of, so I know you've read this far!

Tomorrow, I'm going on a Snowshoe Hike up the Frümseltal, above Alt St. Johann in the Toggenburg. If you're interested, you're very welcome to join me!

**Infos about the tour:**

* 13km, 800m ascent, 1200m descent
* WT2, so medium difficulty, official snowshoe trail
* You don't need to be an expert snowshoe hiker for this trail, but you need your own equipment and ideally you've done some snowshoeing in the past and are adequately fit...
* SAC description and pictures: [https://www.sac-cas.ch/de/huetten-und-touren/sac-tourenportal/obersaess-nideri-fruemseltal-7672/schneeschuhtouren/](https://www.sac-cas.ch/de/huetten-und-touren/sac-tourenportal/obersaess-nideri-fruemseltal-7672/schneeschuhtouren/)
* My planned route: See image at the bottom!
* The avalanche risk is 3 (significant). The route doesn't ever exceed 30° and peaks at just over 2000m so my assessment is that avalanches won't be a problem. But if you plan on joining me, do your own assessment, and join at join own risk. I'm not a certified tour guide in any way!

**Infos about getting there:**

* I'm going from Zurich
* Planning to take the 9:06 Bus from Wattwil to Alt St. Johann Dorf (arriving 9:38)
* From there, taking the Selamatt gondola (11 CHF with a Halbtax/GA)

**Infos about me:**

* I'm a 26 yo Swiss guy, I go hiking a lot and discovered Snowshoeing as my favourite winter activity just 2 years ago.
* I work in IT, like reading, drinking coffee and beer, eating anything with chocolate and talking about various current affairs. 
* I am NOT in any way a certified tour guide! Anyone joining me is still doing so at their own risk! I am somewhat experienced but by no means a professional!

**If you are interested in joining me, PM me or just walk up to me in the Bus. I'll be wearing a navy blue Mammut jacket and grey/orange pants. Make sure to bring your equipment, lunch and plenty of fluids!**

My office was quiet and orderly. Everything was in its place, just the way I liked it. I’ve always believed that a tidy space helps maintain a clear mind. I work as a psychiatrist in a small mental hospital in a quiet town. Serious issues with patients were rare, and occasionally, we would receive someone for evaluation from neighboring cities. For the most part, though, the workload was manageable.But around 1 PM, just as I was about to leave for lunch, they brought in a patient who immediately struck me as unusual.

The man appeared to be around forty, with the rugged look of a factory worker—there were plenty like him in our town. His expression was deeply sorrowful, and his fingers were neatly bandaged.— What’s troubling you? — I asked, keeping my tone professional.His name was Fred, and the story he began to tell sent chills down my spine.— About a week ago, last Thursday, — he started, — I noticed something under my skin. Huge worms, crawling. At first, I thought I was imagining it—it was the middle of the night, after all. But then I started seeing them in the morning when I woke up.He paused for a moment, his face tightening as if the memory itself caused him pain.— But the worst part is the itch, — he continued. — When they start moving, I get this unbearable itch. It’s so bad that I scratch myself until I bleed. I can’t control it.

What happened to your fingers? — I asked, glancing at his bandaged hands.The man lowered his gaze, as if ashamed of what he was about to say.— Yesterday, I felt an unbearable itch at the tips of my fingers. It was so intense that I lost control and started biting them. I tore out several nails with my teeth… and on my thumb, I bit down to the bone.A wave of unease swept over me. A mentally healthy person is simply incapable of biting their finger down to the bone—the brain would never allow it! I kept these thoughts to myself, carefully listening and noting every word in my journal.— Have you seen a doctor? — I asked cautiously. — It could be parasites. They’re known to cause sensations like this and can even affect a person’s mental state.— Yes, I went to a doctor, — he replied, his voice dull and weary. — I had all the tests done. I’m completely healthy. That’s why they sent me to you.

— Have you had any head injuries? Are you under stress? Working long hours? — I asked, running through the standard list of questions, as the textbooks dictate.Fred frowned, considering my questions, then shook his head.— Work’s fine, no issues there. Stress? Well, of course there’s some, but nothing out of the ordinary. And no, no injuries, — he answered calmly, though his voice trembled slightly with tension. He looked at me, and in his eyes, I saw a flicker of desperation.— Doctor, what could this be? What’s happening to me? — his voice cracked as he spoke.I froze for a moment, evaluating his condition. So far, his answers didn’t provide a clear explanation. I continued to jot down every detail in my journal, determined not to miss a thing.

— You need to take some time off. I’ll prescribe you some strong sedatives—they’ll help with the tension. I’ll also add a couple of medications to help clear your mind. Come back in a month for a follow-up, and we’ll decide what to do next, — I said, handing him a piece of paper with the prescriptions.Fred took it with trembling hands and said softly:— Thank you, doctor. I don’t know what I’d do without you.— It’s my job, — I replied with a faint smile, though I couldn’t shake the unease settling in my chest.I watched as he stood up slowly and made his way to the door. Outwardly, I maintained my composure, but deep inside, I couldn’t help but feel that there was more to his story than just stress or overwork.

I decided to consult my qualified colleagues and shared with them what had happened to Fred. Each of them fell into a thoughtful stupor, trying to make sense of what I described. No one could provide a clear explanation for what it might be. At best, they offered speculative theories, but even they admitted they weren’t confident in their guesses.A month passed. Fred didn’t show up for his follow-up appointment. I concluded that the medication must have worked for him, which meant there was no need to worry. Gradually, the incident started to fade from my mind, as if it was just an odd but insignificant chapter in my practice. But everything changed with a phone call from my friend John.— Hey, are you busy today? — his voice sounded tense, and I immediately sensed something was wrong.— No, what’s going on? — I asked, setting aside the papers I was reviewing.— We’ve got a very strange case at the hospital. Can you come?John was a surgeon at the city hospital, and calls like this from him were rare. It immediately put me on edge.— Yeah, I’ll be there in half an hour, — I replied, already grabbing my coat and preparing to leave.

— Thanks for coming so quickly, — John greeted me at the hospital entrance. His face was a mix of exhaustion and worry.— Before I show you the patient, you need to hear what happened, — he said, walking me down the long hospital corridor and handing me the patient’s medical file.I opened the file and skimmed through the notes as John continued:— Last night, the ambulance brought in a patient. He looked horrific—covered in blood from head to toe. At first, we thought he’d been mauled by a pack of rabid dogs. His body was shredded, and in many places, the skin was torn off down to the muscle.John paused for a moment, as if struggling to put his thoughts into words, then added:— But during the examination, we realized something else. He did it to himself. He didn’t just scratch—he bit into his own flesh. Do you understand? No sane person could do something like that.A chill ran down my spine. The description felt disturbingly familiar, but I held back my thoughts for now, focusing on John’s words and the details in the medical file

We entered the hospital room. In front of me lay a man, heavily bandaged and hooked up to an IV drip. The bandages were soaked with blood, stained so red they hardly looked white anymore. I instinctively held my breath, taking in the unsettling sight.— I assume no one knows his name? — I asked, trying to gather more information.— The police are working on that, — John replied. — They found him at an abandoned factory. Teenagers who hang out there stumbled upon him and called the police and an ambulance.— Was he conscious? — I continued, keeping my tone steady despite the unease creeping in.— Yes, but the paramedics had to sedate him heavily. He wouldn’t come willingly—he fought back, struggled, even tried to run, — John explained with a tired sigh.I turned my gaze back to the patient. Even in his stillness, there was something unsettling about him, something I couldn’t quite place but could feel deep down.

  
— Can you show me his face? I might know him, — I said, trying to suppress the growing unease.The pieces of the puzzle were already falling into place in my mind. I had a strong suspicion it was Fred, but I didn’t want to believe it—not yet.John frowned slightly but nodded. Without a word, he carefully unwrapped a few layers of bandages from the patient’s head. It only took a glimpse of his bloodied face for my suspicions to be confirmed.— I know him, — I said with a heavy sigh, my voice weighed down by certainty.— From where? — John asked, his surprise evident as he looked at me, waiting for an explanation.— He’s my patient, — I replied, trying to stay composed, though my voice betrayed the tension I felt.

I told them everything I knew about Fred—his strange illness, the symptoms he had described, and the medications I had prescribed for him last month. A suffocating sense of guilt washed over me. Damn it, he came to me for help… and I couldn’t help him.John listened intently, nodding occasionally as he reviewed the patient’s file. Just then, a police officer entered the room. His expression was deeply troubled, and it was clear he was here for answers.We exchanged brief greetings before heading to John’s office to discuss what had happened. The atmosphere was tense, and the weight of unanswered questions hung heavily in the air.

We quickly brought the officer up to speed, telling him everything we knew about Fred and his condition. He listened intently, and with each detail, his expression grew more serious. Then, he decided to share something that sent a chill down my spine.— The thing is, this is already the third case this month! — he said with clear alarm.John and I exchanged glances, the same thought running through both our minds: ""What the hell is going on?""— Can you tell us more? — I asked, doing my best to stay calm, even as unease began to creep in.The officer glanced around, as if checking for eavesdroppers, then lowered his voice.— I can’t officially disclose this information, but you’re the only competent people who might be able to help. So please, keep what I’m about to tell you strictly confidential…

The atmosphere in the room was thick with tension. The officer took a deep breath, as if trying to gather the courage to speak.— You see, this is the third case like this in our town. We’ve kept this information under wraps. Our forensic experts are baffled. But a third case in such a short time means only one thing—it’s a pattern. This can’t be a coincidence, — he said, his voice tinged with unease.John interrupted him, leaning slightly forward.— Can you tell us more about the other victims?The officer nodded and continued:— It started two weeks ago. Forest rangers reported finding a man’s body in the woods. His body was badly mutilated, and we initially thought he’d been attacked by a wild animal. But during the autopsy, it became clear that the injuries were self-inflicted.He paused, lowering his gaze for a moment, before continuing:— A week later, we got another call. A woman reported strange screams coming from the house next door. They’d been going on for hours. When we arrived, we found only a body. The man was already dead, and his injuries… they were eerily similar to the ones on the first victim.A chill ran down my spine. What had initially seemed like isolated incidents was now forming a disturbing and sinister pattern.

I began summarizing everything we knew so far.— So, here’s what we’ve got, — I said, mostly to myself. — Three people who are literally tearing themselves apart, something that shouldn’t even be possible. One of them is in the ward now, unconscious.I turned to John.— John, how soon will the patient regain consciousness?— Should be this evening, — he replied, glancing at his watch.— Then he’ll be able to answer many of the questions we’ve got, — I added.The officer, standing quietly nearby, spoke up.— Guys, let me know as soon as he wakes up. I’ll come back to talk to him, — he said, his tone calm but firm.We said our goodbyes to the officer and headed with John to the hospital café for some coffee. The atmosphere was still heavy, but a cup of coffee was the only thing that might help settle our nerves for now.

— Listen, — I said, turning to John, — this can’t be a virus, can it?John shook his head.— No, if it were, we’d all be infected by now—including the police and everyone else who came into contact with these people.— Could it be a psychological disorder? — John suggested, staring thoughtfully into his cup of coffee.— No, — I replied, shaking my head firmly. — Disorders like that are extremely rare, and they don’t lead to something this horrifying. And now we have three people with the exact same symptoms.We fell silent, each lost in thought, as we finished our coffee. Then we headed back to the patient’s room.— I’ll stay here, — I said as we entered. — Just in case he wakes up sooner than expected.— Alright, — John agreed. — I’ll go check on the other patients.He left, leaving me alone in the room. I settled into a chair next to the patient’s bed, watching his motionless body and wondering what terrifying truth might be lurking behind this story.

  
I took out my notebook, intending to reread everything Fred had told me. Maybe I missed some crucial detail. As I flipped through the pages, I suddenly heard a faint groan. It was Fred. He was regaining consciousness.I quickly grabbed my phone and called John.— Get to the room, fast! The patient is awake!Hanging up, I leaned over Fred.— Can you hear me? — I asked.With barely audible effort, Fred whispered two words:— Brick factory. At that moment, John burst into the room. Fred repeated the words a couple more times but didn’t respond to any of our questions. Then he slumped back into unconsciousness.— ""Brick factory""? We need to call the officer, — I said, turning to John.John pulled out his phone and quickly briefed the officer. After a short conversation, he looked at me.— There’s only one brick factory in town. It’s up north. The officer is heading there now.I nodded but hesitated for a moment.— I remember, back when I was a kid, there was another factory down south. It’s been demolished for years, but it had massive underground cellars and tunnels.— Stay with Fred, — I said. — I’ll head there and check it out, just in case.John frowned.— Why rush? It’ll be dark soon. Let’s go together tomorrow.— Fair enough, — I agreed. — I’ll just take a quick look from a distance. See if there’s anything unusual.John sighed but didn’t argue further.

I drove for about fifteen minutes. It was already dark, but the bright moonlight illuminated the area, casting eerie shadows across the landscape. I parked my car not far from the ruins of the factory and decided to step out for a cigarette while taking a closer look at the site. Lighting up, I spotted a figure in the distance. The person was moving toward the cellars of the abandoned factory. ""Maybe it’s just a homeless person?"" I thought, but something about their movements felt deliberate, too purposeful to dismiss. Deciding to investigate, I cautiously followed, making sure to stay unnoticed.The hardest part was closing the gap without revealing myself, but I managed to stay hidden while keeping him in sight.The figure reached the cellar, glanced around briefly, and climbed inside. He didn’t look like a homeless person—his actions were too calculated. Perhaps a drug addict or a dealer? Either way, something felt off.I pulled out my phone to call John and fill him in, but there was no signal.— Fine, — I muttered under my breath. — I’ll have to check this out myself.The entrance to the cellar was wide and spacious, littered with debris from the collapsed building. I scanned my surroundings. There were plenty of places to hide if things went south. Steeling myself, I followed the suspicious figure into the dark depths of the cellar.

Walking through the dark, damp corridor of the basement, I saw a faint light at the end of the tunnel. My heart started racing, but I kept moving forward until I reached it.What I saw next stopped me in my tracks. A massive underground room stretched out before me. Inside, there were about two dozen people lying on beds. Each of them had medical tubes inserted into their veins, and blood was being drained into large containers.— What the hell is going on here? — I whispered to myself, feeling a cold sweat trickle down my spine. My first instinct was to take a picture of what I was seeing, but when I pulled out my phone, I realized it was completely dead.— Perfect, — I muttered under my breath, fighting the panic rising within me. I needed to get out of there, and fast, without letting anyone know I’d been there.I carefully made my way back outside. Fear clung to me like a second skin as I retraced my steps. Finally reaching my car, I took a deep breath, trying to calm down.That’s when I noticed a man walking slowly toward the road in the distance. His unhurried demeanor seemed almost unnatural in this eerie setting.— Should I offer him a ride back to town? — I thought, though every instinct inside me screamed to avoid any further involvement.

I decided to take a long detour to avoid revealing that I had been nearby all along. The man was slowly walking along the road toward town. I stopped the car and politely offered him a ride.He agreed. He didn’t look well—pale and weak, which wasn’t surprising if he’d lost as much blood as I suspected at that cursed factory.We started talking. He mentioned that he worked at a pharmacy. I listened casually, all the while thinking about how to steer the conversation toward what I really wanted to know. Finally, I asked:— So, where were you coming from?He visibly tensed. His gaze shifted nervously, as if he didn’t know what to say. Realizing I needed to ease the tension, I decided to take an unexpected approach.— Listen, — I said with a slight grin, — I’ve been having this horrible itch lately. Sometimes I feel like I might start biting myself. Can you imagine? And the doctors can’t do anything about it. Maybe you could recommend some strong sleeping pills?The man turned to me, his face a mix of shock and something darker. Then, his expression hardened.— Medications won’t help you, — he said quietly, his tone almost lifeless. — Most likely, your days are numbered.A chill ran through me. He clearly knew something about what was happening—and that factory was definitely tied to this strange illness.— What do you mean? — I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.— Don’t worry, — he replied, his tone suddenly almost soothing. — I have the same problem. There’s only one way to help you…

I slammed on the brakes, turned to face the passenger, and looked him straight in the eye.— Tell me what the hell is going on here, — I demanded.He sighed, lowering his gaze as if trying to gather his thoughts.— Where do I even start… — he muttered. — These are some kind of unknown parasites. They can’t be detected by any medical tests. Physically, only the host can see them. No one knows where they came from. But there’s a woman—she does experimental medicine. She mixes something in a solution and gives it to us to relieve the symptoms. But you have to drain a portion of your blood first.I listened carefully, trying to process what he was saying.— And this happens at the factory? — I asked.— Yes, not far from where you picked me up, — he confirmed.— How did you find out about the factory? — I asked, watching him closely.— It started when I began having a terrible itch, — he replied, avoiding my gaze. — I didn’t even notice that I was scratching my skin raw during work. One of the pharmacy customers pointed it out to me. He came to buy medical tubing and noticed my hands. That’s when he told me about the factory.Every word he spoke made the situation feel more ominous. This story was getting darker and more horrifying by the second.

— So, I take it your group meets there every evening? — I asked, trying to keep my tone neutral.— Yes, but don’t tell anyone, — he replied cautiously. — This kind of treatment is illegal in our country. If the woman helping us gets caught, she’ll go to prison. And people like us… we’ll be left without any help.I nodded to avoid raising suspicion and dropped him off in town. Without wasting any time, I headed straight to the hospital to see John. As I pulled up, I spotted my furious friend standing near the entrance, pacing back and forth. The moment he saw my car, he started jogging toward me. That’s when I remembered—my phone was dead.— Damn it, — I muttered under my breath as I parked the car.I stepped out and moved toward John, trying to cut him off with the important information I had before he could unleash his frustration.— John, listen, I’ve found something. It’s important, just hear me out… — I began, but his expression made it clear he was ready to let me have it.

On the way to the hospital, I told John everything I had learned. He was stunned. Despite being doctors with a strictly scientific approach to everything, we were both on the brink of accepting something beyond the realm of reason.— This sounds like some kind of insane supernatural nonsense, — John said when I finished. — But honestly, there’s a terrifying logic to it.— Yeah, but if we miss something, it could end in disaster, — I replied, trying to stay focused.When we reached the hospital, John updated me on Fred’s condition.— He’s in a coma now. His condition is severe but stable, — he said.— And the officer? — I asked.— He didn’t find anything suspicious at the factory he went to, — John replied, shaking his head.The pressure was mounting, and we knew time was running out. We called the officer, shared the new information, and arranged a meeting to devise a plan of action.— We can’t keep handling this alone, — I told John after the call. — It’s getting too dangerous.

The officer arrived surprisingly quickly. We all understood that, in this situation, we could only trust each other. The tension in the room was palpable, but determination was clear on everyone’s face.— I’ve got an idea, — I began, taking a deep breath. — I’ll go down into the cellars and pose as a new patient. I’ll try to figure out what’s really happening, meet this mysterious woman, and find out why they need human blood.I turned to John.— John, you’ll stay nearby, outside, keeping an eye on the situation. If anything goes wrong, you’ll be able to step in or signal for help.Then I looked at the officer.— And you’ll be on standby. If we need armed support, you can step in. But the key is not to blow your cover too soon.The officer nodded, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.— It’s risky, but we don’t have many other options, — he said.— The risk is worth it if we can uncover the truth, — I replied, trying to project confidence.The plan was dangerous, but it was the only way to infiltrate this secretive operation and get the answers we needed.

The next evening came quickly. To be honest, I was scared, but curiosity and the sense of purpose overpowered my fear. After all, the mission was important. We equipped ourselves with communication devices: John was responsible for coordination, and the officer was prepared for emergencies.We arrived at the same spot where I had parked my car the previous time. We went over our plan one last time, making sure every detail was covered. Then, I set off on my way.I walked slowly, trying to appear calm, though my heart was pounding in my chest. Up ahead, I noticed a figure heading in the same direction. I quickened my pace to catch up.The man glanced at me and gave a brief nod. I returned the gesture. Without exchanging any words, we continued walking toward the cellar. The atmosphere was tense, and every sound seemed amplified in the silence.Halfway through the tunnel, I decided to break the silence.— Hey, I’m new here. Who should I talk to for help?My companion didn’t even turn to look at me.— You’ll see for yourself, — he said curtly, offering no further explanation. 

Exiting the tunnel, I saw that about fifteen people had already gathered. No one spoke; the silence was eerie and oppressive. Not wanting to draw attention to myself, I approached an empty bed and lay down, mimicking what everyone else seemed to be doing.— Wow, this bed is rock hard, — I muttered, speaking softly into the hidden microphone so John and the officer could hear what was happening. At that moment, a young boy, no older than fifteen, approached me. His expression was serious, almost stoic. Without saying a word, he handed me a small piece of paper.I took it and unfolded it in front of him. The paper had the number ""33"" written on it in bold.— What does this mean? — I asked the boy, but he didn’t respond. He simply turned and walked away without a word.""Maybe they take some sort of vow of silence here,"" I thought, trying to keep my nerves steady.I lay there for about fifteen minutes. Nothing happened, and the stillness was almost unbearable. Then, suddenly, an older woman appeared from one of the side passages. Her movements were brisk and purposeful, belying her age.— Number 33, follow me, — she said in a loud, commanding voice.

I rose slowly from the bed, making sure to appear weak and sickly. Slouching and moving with a heavy gait, I followed the woman down a narrow hallway. She led me to a small, dimly lit room where shadows clung to the walls like a suffocating shroud.— Sit on the couch, — she instructed in a calm but firm tone.I obeyed, lowering myself onto the worn seat, doing my best to mask my apprehension.— Do you already know our rules? — she asked, her voice even.— I only know that no one is allowed to speak about this place, — I replied, recalling the vague instructions from my companion earlier.— That’s correct, — she nodded. — I understand you likely have many questions. I’ll tell you what you need to know.She paused, as if weighing her words, then began to explain:— In 2006, the government started developing a secret biological weapon. The experiments were conducted on a sparsely populated island. Everything was progressing successfully—until it wasn’t. The virus escaped containment, and the entire population of the island was wiped out.I froze, my mind racing as I tried to process what she was saying.— How do you know all this? — I asked cautiously.She locked eyes with me before answering:— I was on that island… as one of the test subjects. I developed immunity. Now, I use my blood to create an antidote. Infected individuals must drain some of their blood during treatments to stimulate the production of new, ""clean"" blood.I was stunned by her revelation. What had initially seemed like a bizarre and isolated phenomenon now revealed itself as part of something much larger and more sinister. I hadn’t realized just how deep this went.

— We’ll now give you an injection and drain a bit of your blood, — the woman said calmly.I nodded. There was no other choice—I had to keep up the act. Everything she said and did was being heard by John and the officer through the hidden microphone. I could only imagine how shocked they must have been.The procedure took about five minutes. They injected me with something and then hooked me up to a tube to drain my blood. Lying on the bed, I tried to remain calm, though the growing unease was hard to ignore.After waiting a little while, I decided it was time to leave this horrifying place. Carefully, I disconnected the blood-draining device, stood up quietly, and made my way toward the exit.The other patients glanced at me with confusion, but no one spoke or reacted. Their silence was more unsettling than any words could have been. As I reached the exit, the officer was already there, waiting for me. Together, we quickly headed toward the car, where John was waiting.— We need to get my blood tested immediately and find out what they injected me with, — I said, barely managing to keep my composure. 

The car ride was filled with a heavy silence. None of us dared to speak, each lost in the gravity of what we had stumbled into. The unease hung in the air, tangible and oppressive.Once at the hospital, we quickly ran the necessary blood tests. The results came back faster than expected. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The only thing I’d been injected with was saline solution.We grabbed cups of coffee and headed to John’s office. The tension lingered as we sat down, and the conversation began without any formalities.— What’s our next move? — John asked, looking directly at the officer.The officer crossed his arms, his brow furrowed.— We can’t take that woman’s word for it. Her claims about the government and secret experiments—it’s too far-fetched to be true, — he said firmly.— True, but on the other hand, it all fits together disturbingly well, — I interjected. — Either way, this is a serious issue we can’t ignore.John, thoughtfully rubbing his chin, added:— We need to go back there during the day and investigate. Find out where the blood is going and what that woman is really doing.We exchanged glances, knowing full well that this wouldn’t be an easy task. 

But first, I needed sleep. I was absolutely exhausted—these had been some of the most stressful days of my life. Yet, despite my fatigue, falling asleep proved difficult. My mind wouldn’t stop racing with thoughts about the woman, what they were doing with the blood, and how we could possibly treat the patient.Sometime during the night, I gave up and went outside for a smoke, hoping it would help clear my head. I knew all the cars in the neighborhood—strangers rarely parked here. That’s why the sight of an unfamiliar car in the distance immediately caught my attention.Inside the car, someone was sitting, motionless.It struck me as odd.— Could it be surveillance? — I wondered.I decided not to confront it right then and there. I needed to be careful. Tossing my cigarette, I returned inside and forced myself to go to bed.By morning, the car was gone, but the unease lingered. My first stop was John’s house. I wanted to catch him before he left for work.— John, we need to talk, — I said as soon as he opened the door.I told him about the strange car and my suspicion that we might be under surveillance. John’s expression shifted to one of concern as he listened.— Do you think it’s connected to the officer? — he asked, frowning.— I don’t know yet, — I admitted. — But we need to be extremely cautious. This puts a serious question mark over who we can trust. 

In the afternoon, we picked up the officer and headed back to the factory. The topic of surveillance wasn’t brought up. Instead, we focused solely on the immediate tasks—where to go, what to look for, and how to respond in different situations.When we reached the factory, we decided to enter from a completely different side—through the ventilation shaft. It was a more challenging route, but it ensured we’d remain unnoticed.We pried open the grating and climbed in one by one, carefully lowering ourselves into the narrow passage.— Keep your flashlights on the lowest brightness, — I whispered, not wanting to draw any attention.The faint beams of light barely illuminated the path ahead, casting long shadows along the walls. We moved in single file, doing our best to avoid making noise.After a few minutes, the tunnel opened up into a massive room. The ceiling loomed high above us, and the walls disappeared into the darkness. An eerie silence enveloped the space, broken only by the faint echo of our movements.— What is this place? — the officer whispered, glancing around.I brought a finger to my lips, signaling for silence, and motioned for us to keep moving forward.

  
After crossing the massive room, we continued down the corridor. The oppressive silence seemed to amplify every step we took. A few minutes later, we noticed an open door to our left.— Should we check it out? — John whispered.We nodded and cautiously entered. Inside, there were five large industrial refrigerators. Even without opening them, we had a grim idea of what they might contain.Summoning my courage, I opened one of the refrigerators. Inside was a mangled body. The flesh was torn, and the limbs hung at unnatural angles. It was clear that the woman’s treatment didn’t work for everyone.Even though we had braced ourselves for discoveries like this, fear gripped each of us. Without opening the other refrigerators, we decided to move on.Exiting the corridor, we headed toward the main hall where patients gathered at night. I pointed to the room where I had spoken with the woman.— Over there, — I whispered.We approached the door cautiously. There was no one around, which was both a relief and an unsettling sign.After a quick glance around, we stepped inside. The room was empty—just a couch, a table, and a chair. There was no sign of recent activity.— Strange, — John muttered.His attention shifted to a curtain in the corner of the room. We moved closer and gently pulled it aside. Behind it was another small, hidden space.

What we saw behind the curtain threw us into a state of pure horror. Four strange bodies lay on beds. At first glance, they resembled humans, but it was clear these were not people.Tubes were connected to their bodies, but unlike the patients we had seen before, these creatures weren’t being drained of blood—it was being infused into them.Above us, blood bags hung from hooks, with a slow, steady stream flowing through the tubes and into the bodies of these creatures.John moved closer to one of them and examined it carefully.— They’re covered in some kind of worms, — he whispered, his voice shaky.I stepped closer to take a look myself.— You’re right, John, — I said, feeling a chill run down my spine. — It’s as if these worms are weaving together, forming a single organism.The officer gagged, barely managing to hold himself together. It was clear we needed to get out of there—and fast.— Let’s move, — I said in a hushed tone, trying to keep the rising panic out of my voice.We decided to take the main exit since it was faster. Moving as silently as possible, we made our way through the dark, empty hallways.Every second felt like an eternity, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife. Even the slightest noise seemed to echo endlessly.When we finally reached the car, we jumped in and sped off, heading straight for the hospital. Along the way, we dropped the officer off at the police station, agreeing to reconvene later to discuss our next steps.

John and I agreed to take a one-day break. We both needed some time to process everything and regain our composure. I remembered that today was my sister’s birthday—a perfect chance to distract myself.The day passed quickly, and by evening, my sister had gathered a large group of friends. For a while, I almost forgot about the recent events, losing myself in the lively conversations and laughter. But then my phone rang. It was the officer.— Where are you right now? — he asked, his voice tense.The question immediately set me on edge.— What’s going on, officer? — I asked cautiously.— I’ll come to you. There’s something I need to tell you, — he replied.I apologized to my sister, saying I needed to step out for 15 minutes, and went outside. Smoking a cigarette, I stood by the road as the officer arrived, speeding as usual.He stepped out of the car and got straight to the point:— Have you told anyone about what’s happening?— No, of course not, — I replied, feeling increasingly uneasy. — Why? What’s going on?— I’ve been assigned to another city for an urgent mission, — he began, glancing around nervously. — But here’s the thing: I got word from my friends at the CIA. They’ve sent a lot of agents to your city on some secret assignment. Do you understand what that means? This isn’t a coincidence.A chill ran down my spine.— That explains a lot… — I started but stopped, trying to piece everything together.After a pause, I decided to trust the officer and told him about the suspicious car I had seen the other night. His expression darkened further.— That just confirms it, — he said grimly. — This is bigger than we thought. We’re all in danger.

The officer and I wrapped up our brief meeting, agreeing to stay in touch and avoid making any unnecessary moves. After saying goodbye, I returned to my sister’s house, where the atmosphere was carefree and lively. Laughter and joy filled the room, but deep down, I knew that after everything I’d witnessed, life would never be the same. My nerves got the better of me, and I ended up drinking too much. My sister’s husband, a genuinely pleasant guy, offered to drive me home.On the way, he asked:— Hey, what’s going on with you? You don’t seem like yourself.— Is it really that obvious that something’s wrong? — I asked, trying to downplay it.— Very obvious, my friend. Tell you what, why don’t we go fishing sometime? Clear your head, forget about things for a while, — he suggested with a friendly grin.I agreed. It sounded like a good chance to regain some composure after everything that had happened.When we pulled up to my house, I glanced around. The suspicious car from the other night was gone, which gave me a small sense of relief.— Thanks for the ride, — I said as I stepped out of the car.— Anytime, buddy. Let me know when you’re ready for that fishing trip, — he replied, waving as he drove off.Heading inside, I felt the weight of exhaustion fully settle in. A long, deep sleep awaited me, and for once, I welcomed it.

A day later, I visited John again to check on Fred’s condition. Unfortunately, there was no change—he was still in a coma. Both of us were in low spirits, struggling to make sense of everything.Suddenly, my phone rang. It was the officer.I picked up, and he wasted no time:— Stay away from that place. Don’t even think about going near it. It’s important. I’ll explain everything once I’m back in town.With that, he hung up abruptly.John and I exchanged uneasy glances. Whatever this meant, it was clear the situation was far from over.A few hours later, we heard an explosion. The sound came from the direction of the factory, and it startled everyone. That evening, the news reported that the old factory had stored leftover chemicals that were never properly disposed of after its closure. According to the report, the chemicals detonated, but there was ""no danger to the town’s residents."" Specialists were now working on containing the aftermath.On the screen, the factory grounds were shown cordoned off with yellow tape and warning signs. People in hazmat suits were moving around the site.— How convenient for the authorities, — I muttered to myself, my suspicion growing.I wanted to discuss this with John, but before I could finish watching the news, my phone rang again.— Did you see the news!? — John asked, his voice tense.— Yeah, — I replied. — I’ll come over. But first, I’ll stop by the store for a bottle of whiskey. We’re going to need it.

Standing by the shelf of alcoholic beverages in the store, I was carefully deciding which whiskey would be best for my conversation with John.Suddenly, I heard a woman’s voice behind me:— How’s your health?I turned around sharply and froze. Standing there was the same woman from the abandoned factory.— I’m fine. How about you? — I replied, trying to mask my rising anxiety with a casual tone.She gave a faint smile, her eyes glinting with an unsettling intensity.— I have a lot of work to do, — she said with a smirk, then turned and headed toward the self-checkout.I stood there, rooted to the spot, watching as she casually scanned her items, as if this encounter was just a coincidence. But I knew better—there were no coincidences in a situation like this.",1,1735905341.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I found out by seeing their messages on her phone, but after I confronted her, she deleted all their  
conversations and changed her passwords. At one point, she unlocked her phone to show me she wasn’t messaging him, but while she was holding it, a message from him came through.

The volume of messages between them was staggering. They message each other constantly, on New Year’s  
Eve, he sent her a message at midnight – the only message she got. Since then, she’s continued messaging him despite seeing how upset it’s made me. Before she deleted the messages, I saw texts like “Do you think we’re doing anything wrong? Are we more than friends?” and “I'm the one person you can talk to me about anything, that's how it should be.”  She’s said that he talks to her about things that he doesn’t speak to his girlfriend about.  She says his girlfriend knows about their meetups, but she’s never mentioned him to me.  She’s told me that he’s funny and makes her laugh, and he’s younger, better looking and better off than me - my wife has always expressed an interest in Poland and wants to visit.

After one of their gym sessions 6 months ago he sent her a poem “Roses are Red, Violets are Blue, I know it, you know it too” which she saved in her notes app.  She says it’s just because she thought it was weird and didn’t ask him what it meant.

Over the past year, she’s spent hundreds of hours with him in secret. At home, she’s become increasingly  
withdrawn and spends most of her time at home on her phone or heading out (to see him at the gym).  I cook dinner for the family and she cooks for herself and does her own shopping. I’ve asked her what the issue is in the past and she says “nothing”.

She says the messages are innocent but refuses to explain them or why she deleted them. She insists  
they’re “just friends” and that she’s done nothing wrong.

Every project has its unique deadline circus:

The Last-Minute Genius – Spends weeks strategizing and 30 minutes executing... because brilliance strikes at the 11th hour, obviously.

The Phantom Approver – Ghosts every email, but magically reappears two hours after the deadline with just a quick revision.

The Jack-of-All-Trades – Fixing spreadsheets, troubleshooting tech issues, and somehow organizing birthday cakes.

The Slide Warrior – Starts a presentation with, this is a draft, because PowerPoint decided to crash right before the big meeting.

The Urgent-But-Not-Important Manager – Everything’s high priority until the deadline passes, and suddenly no one remembers why it was a big deal.

And then there’s us, the survivors, wearing our deadline war scars proudly... until someone drops the next “urgent” email in our inbox.

But the deadline circus teaches us resilience, creativity, and the fine art of staying just functional enough to get it all done. Plus, who doesn't love the adrenaline rush of surviving a chaotic deadline yet again?

Unlike traditional top-down planning methods, tactical urbanism encourages grassroots initiatives and temporary interventions to improve public spaces.

Temporary interventions can alter public perception and the direction of policy debates. People may support more lasting changes in urban planning and policies if they see good results as a result of Tactical Urbanism projects.

Creating temporary bike lanes and pedestrian walkways can help demonstrate the potential impact of more permanent infrastructure changes. It also encourages active transportation and reduces reliance on cars.""

What can we do to change that? [UK],"I love coffee and, lately, hot chocolate during winter. It's frustrating that many coffee places, even big chains like Pret, Knoops don’t offer ceramic or glass mugs for dine-in, forcing everyone to use disposable cups. I know I can bring my own cup, but sometimes I forget. Offering reusable mugs could greatly reduce plastic waste and improve the experience for stay-in customers. Why aren’t more places adopting this simple, impactful change? Can we do anything about it (besides not buying our drinks from those places)?

Deadlines - The magical force that transforms us into caffeinated superheroes, capable of pulling all-nighters, rewriting entire reports in minutes, and sending emails that begin with, “As discussed earlier…” (even when nothing was discussed).

Every project has its unique deadline circus:

The Last-Minute Genius – Spends weeks strategizing and 30 minutes executing... because brilliance strikes at the 11th hour, obviously.

The Phantom Approver – Ghosts every email, but magically reappears two hours after the deadline with just a quick revision.

The Jack-of-All-Trades – Fixing spreadsheets, troubleshooting tech issues, and somehow organizing birthday cakes.

The Slide Warrior – Starts a presentation with, this is a draft, because PowerPoint decided to crash right before the big meeting.

The Urgent-But-Not-Important Manager – Everything’s high priority until the deadline passes, and suddenly no one remembers why it was a big deal.

And then there’s us, the survivors, wearing our deadline war scars proudly... until someone drops the next “urgent” email in our inbox.

But the deadline circus teaches us resilience, creativity, and the fine art of staying just functional enough to get it all done. Plus, who doesn't love the adrenaline rush of surviving a chaotic deadline yet again?

Here’s to everyone managing the circus with style, grace, and a LOT of coffee.

In the morning anywhere between 5:45-6:30am I am woken up by really loud banging against the counter. Like, it soundly like a mix of a hammer and someone like throwing a basketball against the counter. It’s extremely loud and consistently wakes me up. 

I work from home, so get up between 7:30-8am depending on my start time. I understand others work earlier. 

I’ve tried earplugs but can’t hear my alarm fully, and have tried a sleep mask with sound. It hasn’t worked. I don’t sleep well either so lately have had very broken sleep, and this happens at the weekend too. 

I don’t know how to talk to them about it. The idea of knocking on their door makes me want to throw up, and I’m paranoid that it’ll cause hostility and they’ll try and retaliate or something, or it’ll make living harder. 

I imagine it’s like they’re trying to clear the puck of a coffee machine or something, and I know I can’t stop them from living and making food in the morning, but it is so loud. Especially when they have access to a communal kitchen too, which is away from the rooms.

1hskfde,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1hskfde/idk_if_hypomanicmanic_or_not/,idk if hypomanic/manic or not,"was recently looking into it - read a book by this guy John Gartner centering around bill Clinton but also positing he had what the author called a ""hypomanic temperament"" and so I looked into hypomania which naturally led me to bipolar disorder and I read some of the items on the list and it resembles to me episodes which I get into from time to time. like, there will be days in a row where I'll get into these moods - and ill elaborate more in my second paragraph - specifically *now* as one of them, except as a low kind of it, (explain later) which makes it all the more frightening - and then the days where I kind of just sit around and do nothing, either out of complete empty/laziness or out of wallowing in bad bad, but I wanted to cross reference my experience of what I take might be hypomania vs the real deal? or if it's something else entirely? or if it corresponds to normal mood swings? idk, but here's-

what I find is that I have a tremendous amount of nervous/anxious energy for days at a time. ive seen a lot of descriptions as hypomania being characterized by tremendous energy, and I have absolutely tremendous energy for these days, but it's never a warm-contented kind of energy you'd think would accompany the super-high mood or what but more like a tension in the chest that is super fueling everything I do. like, normally when I wash the dishes - dumb example I know but this was relevant today - I just wash the dishes and then yay they're done, days like this I wash the dishes and im constantly turning around to look at the clock to push myself to get it done faster and in as little time as possible and then once I finished I start looking for everything I could possibly do in relevance to the situation so here I am using a vacuum cleaner to suck up ground up coffee seed from off the counter and wiping down the stains on the machine and heating up water for the day next while getting rid of the tea that was in the water heater jug thingy by pouring it into its normal jug in the fridge except when I did it I was trying to get as much of it in the container as possible all the while badgering my mom to read this book I had started earlier today and read a few hundred pages of (the power broker, Robert Moses and the fall of New York, which, actually, id recommend cus its absolutely fucking amazing) and then what, doing the laundry, doing my parents' laundry, taking a (very intense with scrubbing) shower, folding clothes, making bed, taking out the trash - everything from when I started talking about the night from the start of mentioning the dishes in the matter of like fifty minutes or so with no breaks? and then for some reason my dumbass decided to draft a nine page city ordinance law for my faux town council city project thingy ive got in the works. then I went to the gym and -- this might be an important second step --

the energy naturally is anxious energy. and normally it doesnt devolve into outright anxiety, though when you pause for a moment - well, this is how I described it to a friend ""if you stop for a second you feel your chest and soul being twisted and wrenched by something that wants to rip your heart to shreds"" - not even necessarily fear, just discomfort and channeling emotions I guess, I don't really take note of it as a negative state most of the time - but I was in the gym today, and there was a door to my dark apartment lobby, right, and all of a sudden my brain concocts this vision of a white, pale faced phantom thingy with its demented face pressed to the glass of those doors with its mouth agape and its eyes open with a sadistic kind of smile and it'd be bony like a deer skeleton and it'd break through and tear through everything there including me with the strength of a fucking chimpanzee - and then I started becoming hyper aware of literally everything around me - actually as im writing this it sounds more like an anxiety attack than hypomania, maybe because this time as im writing this its because the state is so interlaced with symptoms of anxiety that I can't help but pour it all out in this stream - I promise normally it doesnt feel nearly this bad, it's a lot more positive, it really is, there isn't nearly as much fear in what I usually describe, more a need to keep going and get more stuff done and overconfidence - I'm not even sure if you can call it the same thing, spare the energy I had earlier today at the start when I was washing dishes but then it all expanded and bloomed into this whole abomination of a mental state - but yeah, you get the gist. I don't think I even noticed my normal higher energy states until afterwards (when I'm so fucking exhausted and flat that only then I realize how absolutely off the rails I was) but now that its paired with this kinda negative emotion I guess ive become aware of it. it's uhh... it's an experience to say the least.

also, my sleep is fucking screwed. I don't know if it's over winter break or what, but somehow I've managed to push my sleep schedule up to sleeping at 7 or 8 AM in the morning, 11 AM yesterday. Aside from yesterday cus I stayed up so long, I haven't seen the sun at all this week cus I sleep through the (short) day (likely caused by the fact its the middle of winter, the days are shorter) but you know what I mean. on the bright side I've managed to get a lot done through these nights. mastered a few khan academy math grades (I mastered 100% all of early math review up to 4th grade just cus I felt like it, which may have given me a boost in fundamentals, probably, maybe), binged like 400 episodes of webcomic, went to the gym for the first time since having pneumonia - I think I still I have pneumonia right now, actually, but it's wearing off a lot so I'm going to the gym anyway - actually, I've calmed down quite a bit as I'm writing this, I don't see it as anxiety anymore, I think I can describe it in more detail. what, do you ever experience the - so I was on, like, a platform, overlooking my city - it was just a 3rd floor open to the street, like opened up with just a fence - and I saw the skyline of my city in the distance and it was tall with skyscrapers and gleaming like a city of gold. but then nearer to where the target was, a lot of the buildings were more one-story - dead trees with the onset of winter, it looked drab, the electric poles were wooden and not steel - and I saw two car lots next to each other, I forget which companies. and the first thing that popped into my mind was - what if we build a car mall? what if we stack up car lots on top of each into another into a giant car mall where customers can go up and down, compare cars, all the while saving space with these gigantic piles of cars in parking lots that are frankly ugly and take up so much surface area? and with the remaining space we can dedicate it to commercial or urban development or the creation of public parks or schools or whatever - I got very seized by this idea and in that moment I felt like I can and should and needed to make it happen. that kind of thing happens a lot when im in those moods. also uhh - well this doesn't happen when I have school - but these nights I have been so busy with all the stuff that ive been doing that I simply decided not to shower for a few nights, I wanted to but I was always so busy and then it was so late and showering that late would wake my parents up (my apartment has terrible soundproofing) so I opted to not;

I am also do stupid stuff a lot. I dont like how at this age early into high school ive already done the big 3 of ""smoked weed, gotten drunk, had sex"" - it's not that I'm some kind of peer pressured poor teenager, far from it, I literally fucking researched all 3 before I did them (I dont even know why at this point, what the hell) - and not that I'm some kind of thoughtless antisocial satanical figure either - it was kind of just kind of irresistible in the instances where I've had them. I kind of just had an impulse to do them. only once or twice, cause luckily my supply was centered entirely in other people I never had a ready supply to gorge off on my own accord. I don't like the idea of what that would look like, cause if my relationship my caffeine is any example, I'll tell myself, okay, I have this giant case of energy drinks, I'll make it last by drinking one a day, and then end up drinking 4 or 5 (800-1000m of caffeine) at the end every single day because it just becomes uncontrollable. not that I don't try to not. today isn't like that though, luckily - or not - because I'm out of energy drink (haaaa!!) cause I drank all of it and ran out like 2 days ago.

oh yeah. this kind of concerns me. so I was getting all my tasks done as I described earlier and then I decided a volleyball PE unit was coming up and my next goal was to get my friend to teach me volleyball. and now that I look back on it - what the fuck was I doing and thinking - id normally keep this kind of thing under wraps but it might mean something int his context - uh, so her issue was that her mom follows her to practice, and my immediate suggestion was ""so break your sister's legs and then as your mom gets called up to the ER you'll have the court to yourself and then I'll pop in"" - then she was talking about the security camera in her room that she can't get beside to turn off and I told her that since she's good at volleyball before she walked into the room she should throw the volleyball and have it arc and hit the camera - which now that I look back is unrealistic as hell - and then when nothing happened I crashed out - Jesus it was bad. apparently agitation is a symptom but she told me she was going off to try and manipulate her grandparents into letting her volleyball and since I was waiting too long like 4-5 minutes but since I have my whole stream of consciousness out in the open I guess we can use that - I went ""I can manipulate a pile of cow shit to fertilize a patch of desert faster than you manipulate your grandparents...I can manipulate an acorn into becoming a 70 foot tall oak tree faster than you can manipulate your grandparents...you are the pile of cow shit at this point...nah, that's too high praise...a pile of cow shit can at least fertilize something and then shit grows...on the one hand no one would want to fertilize you and on the second hand you can't get shit done and growing...jesus christ.""

so that was stupid. I said very bad thing cause I had to wait 5 minutes. and it really concerns me

...uh to be honest, I don't even know if im still in this ""hypomanic""(?) mood. I think it looks to me like it's been there for the last few days, peaked like one or two ago in an intense anxious something, where my mood was actually ""bad"" enough to me (normally It feels like im on top of the fucking world) to be worth consulting help for, and now its just... I don't fucking know anymore actually. but yeah, the shit like grandiosity I feel like I was unable to manifest in this post because the main brunt of the ""episode"" may have been gone by the time I felt like I needed to seek help? so all you guys have is descriptions? I don't know actually. I have no clue.

I'm just going to post this because I don't know anymore - and suddenly all the tiredness from the last few days is kicking in and now I want to collapse into a coma. if I don't then I end up wallowing in very sad sad so better to sleep atp",2,1735903638.0,bipolar2,3,1.0,False

In a dramatic decision announced on January 3, 2025, President Joe Biden officially halted Nippon Steel's ambitious $14.9 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel. The decision stemmed from concerns over national security and economic stability, a sentiment echoed by the influential United Steelworkers union. 

Nippon Steel had proposed significant concessions to cease U.S. worries, including relocating its headquarters to Pittsburg and giving the U.S. government veto power over production decisions. Despite these efforts, the acquisition was deemed too risky. The collapse of this deal sends a strong signal to the global market: critical American industries, like steel, are off-limits to foreign buyers. Analysts believe this may discourage future cross-border mergers in sensitive sectors. 

**China Defies Slow Steel Demand with Record Iron Ore Imports** 

While the world's steel demand slows, China is defying expectations by increasing its iron ore imports. Projections suggest imports could hit a staggering $1.27 billion tons in 2025, up by 10 to 40 million tons from the previous year. The rise comes amid a domestic property crisis that has softened steel demand. 

Australia and Brazil, major suppliers, are rushing to meet this demand, while new production from the Simandou project is expected to enter the market soon. However, the surge in supply has led to predictions of falling iron ore prices, ranging from $75 to $120 per ton for 2025, down from 2024's peaks of $144 per ton. Additionally, China's port stockpiles could swell to a hefty 170 million tons, reflecting the nation's continued dominance in the global steel supply chain.

**Tata Steel Navigates Global Challenges and Domestic Opportunities** 

India's Steel giant Tata Steel is juggling global headwinds and strong local demand. The company's shares saw minor fluctuations this week, with a 1.02% rise to 138.15 Rupees on January 2, 2025, following a 0.98% dip the day before. 

CEO T.V. Narendran acknowledged the challenges posed by intense competition from Chinese steelmakers but emphasised that India's robust infrastructure growth is driving demand. Tata Steel is focusing on high-value products to differentiate itself and weather global pressures. 

**Australian Government Freezes Steel Imports, Raises Costs**

In a controversial move, the Australian government has effectively frozen steel mesh imports to protect local producers. This decision, part of an anti-circumvention investigation, targets imported steel products similar to tariffed materials like wire rods. 

The Anti-Dumping Commission (ADC) has delayed its findings twice, extending the investigation by seven months. This delay has left importers scrambling, fearing higher duty costs and disrupted trade. Critics including global players like Thyssen Krupp, argue this move breaches World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and unnecessarily inflates building costs in Australia.

**Commodities Market Sees Steel Ingredients Struggle Amid Global Shifts** 

In 2024, steel-making coal faced significant price declines due to China's slowing economy, even as other commodities like cocoa and coffee surged. Experts predicted 2025 will be marked by heightened global trade tensions, particularly under the renewed presidency of Donald Trump. Steel-related commodities could face further volatility while precious metals like gold are expected to gain as safe-heaven investments. 

**Vietnam's Steel Industry Gears Up for Sustained Growth** 

Vietnam's steel sector is poised for continued profit growth in 2025, albeit at a more tempered pace. Rising domestic demand is driving optimism, as per SSI Securities' recent analysis. Steel Makers in Vietnam are strategically positioned to capitalize on infrastructure projects and regional growth opportunities. 

**Australia Invests $750 Million in Green Steel Mill**

In a bold step towards sustainability, the WestView Group announced plans to build a $750 million green steel mill in Brisbane. The facility, slated to begin operations by 2027, aims to produce 500,000 tonnes of low-carbon steel annually. This initiative aligns with Australia's commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and reducing reliance on lower-quality steel imports. Industry experts see this as a significant milestone in the global shift toward environmentally friendly steel production. ",1,1735903568.0,u_sweetboyzulu,0,1.0,False

She has to ask if she could drive a car to go someplace. Both of them don’t actually work as they receive freelance and gov money. So they’re at home almost all the time and I don’t really know when they’ll leave and for how long they’ll be home either.

I honestly don’t really have like friends or other family who could help me. Or other place I could stay at. I was wondering what I could do to change things? Like how to get to work without the car rides. How to find a different job that values me.

Tips, tricks and lessons learned:  
\- Write down your WHY for this no-buy and keep it in a place where you can read it easily, for example on the homescreen of your phone. You will get itchy to buy things and with keeping your why in mind it is easier to resist the itch.   
\- Make a red, yellow and green list for which items you are and are not allowed to buy during your no-buy year. It will be your support during this challenge, when you are doubting about things look at your list and decide if it is a yes or a no. Be strict! Once again, you will get itchy to buy things and by holding on to your list it is easier to resist the itch.  
\- Track your progress, it is really fun and enjoying to visualize your progress through the year. Also, it creates a time to reflect and holf yourself accountable, if you do fail think about why did you fail, learn from it, and move on.   
\- Make a wishlist. Put every item you see and want on that wish list. Set a rule for yourself that if you still want that item after X amount of time, you are allowed to buy it. However, in my experience you will notice often times you do not even want that item anymore.  
\- It is a constant battle in your head. Hardest thing for me is that I work for my money so I also feel like I 'deserve' things. Some things really bring me joy, is it then a wastefull purchase? But I acknowledge that battle and realise it is about mindfull purchases instead of mindless purchases.   
\- Sometimes it feels like a never ending battle, you're saving money because you're being frugal, but on the other hand all the other 'obligated' costs are rising. It feels like in the end there is no win, however remember without being frugal those extra costs would be an even harder hit on you.   
\- There. Will. Always. Be. Another. Sale. Trust me. Do not give in on the impuls purchases. No need to panick or go into scarcity mind set, there are many options available nowadays and there will always be an option.    
\- Source second hand if you know you need to buy something. Second hand can be just a good as new and often is much cheaper. Extra plus, it is sustainable.   
\- Lend stuff from friends or family or maybe even Facebook groups. You don't need all the stuff for yourself or all year round.  
\- Get creative, re-use stuff or repurpose stuff. Just because an article is not designed for camping does not mean you can not take it camping, for example.   
\- Keep yourself busy, like: walking, exploring nature, going to the library, taking care of plants, reading, doing puzzles, learning a language or other new things, journaling, drawing, decluttering, yoga, running, hiking, sports in general, playing games, photographing, writing, watching documentaries, creating content.  
\- Surround yourself with like-minded people. I enjoyed watching Grace Nevitt on youtube and for me it was also extra motivational.   
\- Shop in your own closet/room/house first. Install a wardrobe app to document all of your clothings and accessoires. You can play with creating new outfits with stuff you already own. I used the app Indyx.   
\- Meal planning. Plan your meals for the week and then go grocery shopping 1 day per week. Make a grocery list and following that list, for me because of the list I don't wander off or look at unnecessary discounts. It saves a lot of money and a lot of temptation and impulse buying.   
\- Planning in general will save you money. If I have to travel a long way I will go to the supermarket and buy some drinks and snacks there, or prepare something myself at home and bring it along. Lot of stuff is available second hand if you know you are going camping in X amount of weeks and still need some things for that, you still have time to browse for most stuff second hand.   
\- Society is made for us to buy and want more, that is how the marketing is targeted. Remember that is the case, acknowledge it and move one. In the end we are all just human and trying our best. Don't give up!! I also had 33 red and yellow days, but my green days were a lot more significant.   
\- It can be a slippery slope. After my first red day and spending money on stuff I thought *well anyways it does not matter anymore,* but it is good to acknowledge that thought and break yourself out of that reasoning. Go back to your WHY and red, yellow, green list and move on.   
\- Be realistic. Don't buy for your fantasy self.  I like to think about things I think I will enjoy or things I will wear, but when I am realistic with myself I know I won't use those things or wear those items in a day to day life.   
\- If you know beforehand there will be a situation where you will need to spend money, think about it, set a budget and stick to it. This will help reduce impulse buying and also the stress around buying. When the budget is finished it's finished, from that point everything you will see is an instant no. You know you can't buy it anyways, so you don't even have to think about it. Hooray!  
\- If somethings breaks or gets lost, see if you can go a week without it before buying straight away a new replacement.   
\- Try to find joy in just looking at things and appreciating the beauty in that moment. Think about it as looking at art in a musem, you don't need to take everything home that is beautifull, you can just observe and enjoy. Right?  
\- Focus on cheap or free experiences and get creative. Don't deprive yourself from experiences, we only live once and creating experiences and memories is in my opinion a big part of what life is about. Take a walk with a friend and bring your own coffee or snacks, cook dinner at home and invite a friend or the other way around, for example.   
\- Food for thought: Did I ever regret buying something last year? Yes. Did I ever regret NOT buying something last year? No.  
\- Lastly, it gets easier during time. Slowly but surely you are rewiring your brain. Keep it up!

Next goal for me is minimalism, reducing the amount of stuff I have, including cleaning out the pantry. I still will be lurking here, wishing you all good luck for 2025! ",17,1735903455.0,nobuy,2,0.95,False

It was bubbled up maybe 2 inches off the regular floor height, and bouncing when stepped on.

My wife ordered an iced laté and forgot to ask for cream (the best part), we were willing to go back and pay in a separate transaction but the lovely lady on the counter suddenly stopped understanding english.

It’s a small grocery store in a shopping area. there’s some issues at the store but it’s for a different conversation. I got this feeling and I know or at least I think I know that they don’t want me there. But they have exactly found someone to replace me. It feels weird with how things are and it also feels like I’m in limbo at work. 

I currently live with my father, stepmother, and their 12 year old son. It’s a small 2 bed one bath house on one floor. It’s not terrible but it isn’t great either. There’s yelling, roaches, 3 dogs to name a few etc.. they like to eat fast food and shop at the dollar store. it feels overwhelming here most often times.

There doesn’t seem to be space and privacy. My father is retired with some health conditions like bad eye sight. He hardly ever drives anymore. She can drive but my father owns both cars. She has to ask if she could drive a car to go someplace. Both of them don’t actually work as they receive freelance and gov money. So they’re at home almost all the time and I don’t really know when they’ll leave and for how long they’ll be home either. 

I currently don’t drive but I have leaners permit and a drivers ed certificate. I’ve been getting rides to work in the mornings. I walk to the gym or the coffee shop after work. I will tell my stepmother where I am after work. But My father will still try to call me to see where I am.

Like, I’d already been standing there for 15 mins when this woman (classic Karen vibes) just walks right up to the counter like she owns the place. Totally ignored the rest of us.



Someone behind me tried to say something, like, “Um, there’s a line,” but Karen just goes, “I’m in a hurry,” and acts like that makes it okay. The staff didn’t want to argue, so they just took her order first.



I was so mad but decided to keep my mouth shut for now. Then I noticed what she ordered—a large iced coffee with extra whipped cream. That’s when I got an idea.



When it was finally my turn, I ordered the exact same thing but asked them to hold it for a sec. As Karen strutted out with her drink, I casually walked back to the counter and was like, “Hey, I think she grabbed my coffee by accident.” Said it loud enough for everyone to hear.



The staff got all apologetic, and Karen had to come back inside with her smug face looking not-so-smug anymore. She had to wait for them to remake her drink while I left sipping mine and smiling like an idiot.



Petty? Sure. But worth it? 1000%. 😏

I'm the youngest of all and I live with my parents while two of my sisters are in university and the oldest is getting her PhD 
  Since I am the only one home , I tend to see my parents stressing about money all the time since they support all of us. All my sisters are still dependent on our parents and I don't find that as a problem despite their ages
   The problem is they keep on asking for moreee money , like they get a monthly allowance but before the month ends they'll be calling my parents saying they are broke and have no money to even buy food.
   It's either my parents are in denial or just believe them and pity them but we all know that the money was either spent on materialistic stuff or going to expensive cafe's to buy an overpriced coffee which u can make at home.
  My parents are spoiling them and yet they call me a spoiled brat...... what's worse is that they blame it on stress . My oldest sis literally called my mom today saying she is broke and strated blaming it on being the exam season and the stress made her irresponsible.
  I know this is partly my parents fault but thats just how they are and it won't ever change and my sisters are taking advantage of it . So I took it to my hands and sent long massages saying that they have no shame and I'm the one who has to deal with my parents complaining while they are getting the good end of the deal....",9,1735901893.0,AITAH,9,0.92,False

It doesn’t help that they’ve always gotten along so easily. Their connection is natural, effortless, and before now, you never questioned it.

Intimate things about life, marriage, whispered like harmless secrets.

You close the laptop, the room dimming as the glow of the screen fades. The fire crackles in the hearth, throwing shadows across the walls. On the coffee table, two glasses of wine sit side by side, one still half-full, untouched.

The air feels heavy, charged with something unspoken. you stand, pulling a blanket tighter around your body, and move to the window. Snow falls steadily, thickening the darkness outside. The lake is barely visible now, just a pale haze against the shifting outlines of trees.

The house is too quiet. Too empty.

Where are they?

The thought races through that overactive mind, irrational yet insistent. Were those shared smiles earlier just friendly? Or was there something beneath them, something you’ve been too blind—or too afraid—to see?

That heart pounds and you move toward the door, hesitation filling your actions. Are you overreacting, letting doubts and insecurities twist something innocent into something sinister? Or are you now only seeing what you've been avoiding all along?

The cold rushes in as the heavy door opens. For a moment  just standing there, letting the snow whip softly against your face, the silence of the night pressing in from all sides.

I take a step forward, the snow crunching underfoot, drawn by a need to know. Whatever truth waits out there, I’m no longer sure I want to find it.

1hsjstw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hsjstw/th_the_mirror/,[TH] The Mirror,"Every morning starts with the same old song. The same alarm sound. That same annoying tune that has grown old over time and has been distorted by repetition. Every day I want to change that song, replace it. But something inside me won't allow it, as if this melody that so torments me will be hurt and misunderstand my intentions. Maybe it's that weird force of habit that keeps me in bondage to something I hate, simply because that's the way it's always been.

Habit. Strange thing when you think about it. ""Action which by frequent repetition has somehow become formalized so that, though we perform it deliberately, it does not particularly occupy our thoughts or require any effort."" Sounds like brainwashing, doesn't it? The mind is manipulated in such a way that sooner or later it takes a certain behaviour or mindset for granted. The only difference is that a habit is brainwashing that we alone - usually - practice on ourselves.

And because of a habit, I feel nothing but despair. A habit that I myself decided to have. I alone convinced my mind that I need. And no, of course I'm not talking about that same song that plays every time the clock strikes 6, no matter how tiresome my need to listen to it has become. The truth is, I've gotten used to an idea. An idea that God knows why it still exists. Her. She's to blame for everything. She with her blonde curls, her lovely greenish eyes. The one who, when I first saw her, bathed in moonlight, seemed to shine brighter than any star. She.

And then me. Me the coward. Me who never became a man. Me who would rather play with dolls than toy soldiers. Me who couldn't help but panic at the mere idea of talking to a woman, let alone a woman like her. How could I talk to someone like that? So I was left with desire. It was the itch I couldn't scratch. A thirst I couldn't quench, except with her caress. I wanted her to see me, to know who I was. Was that so much to ask?

The days went by, I didn't forget. I didn't forget that sweet yet bitter evening when I saw her in the park for the first time. It was just another one of those days. Trying to get my thoughts in order, I used to leave the house and walk, hoping that each step would bring me closer to the end of my reflections. Often I would come to conclusions I had reached long before, but I was used to pretending that I liked to think while I walked. Perhaps I needed that more dramatic tone to my musings to make my problems seem more important. Another one of my meaningless habits.

While walking, I tended to stop at any point that caught my attention enough to inspire thoughts. Old buildings, churches, benches and fountains in parks became my places of contemplation. That day, I had chosen the park and I'm not sure if I'm glad or sorry I did.

That's where I saw her. She was shining under the full moon. The silver of the moon bathed her hair, and it was as if the night had given her the light of every star in the sky as her eyes sparkled. The reddest rose could not compare with her lips. The most beautiful work of art could not touch the perfection of her smile. In that moment, the earth could open up and swallow everything around her. I wouldn't realize it until she was gone too.

I had goosebumps. For the first time I felt so worthless, so vulnerable just at the sight of a girl. I had to talk to her. I had to do something. But what? How? I was merely a stranger and she was a devine silhouette I happened to be lucky enough to face. It's amazing how I could spend an entire day immersed in a sea of thoughts, and yet, in front of her, my mind went blank. I was paralyzed in the same place, unable to move the slightest muscle. ""Coward"" I thought. ""Do something.""

I didn't. I couldn't.

The road home was short, but every moment away from her seemed like an eternity. At night, my usual grim and dark nightmares gave way to sweet dreams. Or that's what I'd like to think. When I woke up I couldn't remember what I might have seen this time, but I assumed something good. On the other hand, I didn't remember what I saw the other times either, but I always assumed something bad. Who knows?

From that night on, I kept looking for excuses to pass by the park in the hope of seeing her again. And indeed, I succeeded several times. But not once did I find the courage to speak. As the days went by, the walks in the park became a habit, and with them the idea of her became a habit. Just the idea of seeing her was enough to fill me up.

Over time, however, I began to feel resentment. Unfulfilled desire. Everywhere I looked I saw her. I wished she would appear before me. I couldn't work anymore. I couldn't concentrate. I needed her. And the idea of her wasn't enough.

I used to like to look at myself in the mirror and think. Sometimes I would think that something was wrong, that things weren't the way I wanted them to be. That's when I saw in my reflection what I wanted to be. Other times I felt pride in even my smallest accomplishments. It was then that I saw more than I could ever be. But there were also times when I didn't know what to think. Who am I? What am I doing here? What meaning is there? That's when I couldn't see anything. A blurry void where my face should have been. Or at least my mask. But even the void was something real.

All of this was the only thing unstable enough in my daily life that it didn't become a mechanical repetition like everything else. My thoughts. It wasn't something I did in a regular basis. And they were never the same thoughts every time.

It took a woman to change that, too. Now, every look I gave the mirror ended in melancholy. Melancholy for what I wanted so badly and couldn't claim. Melancholy because the mirror reminded me of that. Melancholy because even my reflection was her. A face I had come to know so well, and yet I didn't know the person behind it at all.

The thought crossed my mind that I had become obsessed. I make no secret of the fact that I shuddered at the possibility. It would have been unnatural to have developed an obsession with someone I'd never really met. No, it couldn't be that. Obsessives are crazy. Psychos. I couldn't be obsessed. It was something else. Something like... A habit. Yeah, that's it. A habit. That's all it could be. I wasn't obsessed, I just had another habit.

Like any habit of mine, however, it became torturous over time. Every day, every hour, every minute, the same thoughts, the same images. The passage of time made me dislike this habit that was so disturbing to me. I hated waking up and thinking about it every morning. I hated looking in the mirror and seeing her beautiful face. But most of all, I hated her. I hated her for the brainwashing she made me do to myself. For the need she created in me. My constant need to see her. My annoying need to see her. My awful need to see her.
The mirror became my own personal torture chamber. Every time I saw her through it, only one thought would cross my mind: ""Break it."" But I hesitated. I couldn't hurt her. Not even her image. I was too fragile. Only the idea of destruction, the idea of violence frightened me. And yet, she managed to throw me out of my own self. She trapped me in a vicious circle. The more I lost myself because of her, the more I hated her, and the more I hated her, the more I tore at my old skin. The more I lost my old self. The more violent thoughts I had.

One day, on the way home from work, my car hit a pothole in the road. I got out to see if there was any damage. Luckily, the car was fine. But I noticed the pothole. Water had collected in it. It had been raining this morning, so it was logical that it hadn't dried out yet. But it wasn't the water that caught my attention. It was my reflection in it. Because it wasn't mine. I couldn't resist. I stepped on it furiously. Until the water was gone, until it was mud, so blurry that her image was no longer visible. Passers-by were astonished. I didn't care. It was enough for me to get rid of her.

At home, the first thing I did was to get rid of the dirt I picked up by stepping in the mud. While washing my face, I made the mistake of looking in the mirror. There she was again. No matter how much water I used, her face wouldn't leave mine. I started scratching my face with my fingernails. To get her off me. Get her out of my mind forever. I was covered in wounds. Wounds that burned. But they burned nicely. Almost satisfactorily. My fingernails were covered in blood. My blood. Blood I took from myself. But in the mirror it wasn't me. It was her. In her hands was my blood. How dare she?

""Break it!""

There was no other solution. I tried to strangle her through the mirror. I started beating her. More. More. In a twisted way, for the first time in days I felt good. I felt euphoric. I realized how much the shards of glass in my fists hurt only after the entire mirror had shattered. Only after every part of her image was gone, leaving only shards behind.

I looked at the floor and the walls. Everything was covered in red splashes. One for each bump on the mirror. I watched my blood reflect from shard to shard. I couldn't keep the smile from my lips. Blood. Blood where once there was only her. My blood, though. How dare she take my blood? How dare she do this to me? I couldn't ignore this sin of hers. It was then that I made the fateful decision to take another walk in the park.

I waited for some time on a bench near where she usually passed by. I waited. And I waited. And before I knew it, the night had covered the day with its black veil. I was cold. I was tired. I kept waiting, though. Eventually she would pass by. Usually by this time I'd be home, but not today. Today I had to insist.

I observed the space around me. Like my house, the alleys in the park were filled with red splashes. I looked at my hands under a lamp. Every piece of glass stuck to my fingers reflected its light. But it wasn't white light. The blood on the shards of the mirror had given it a dark red tinge. Red gloomy light burst across the street here and there in a way that looked as if some hideous crime had just taken place. A crime. And the blood was mine. How dare she?

Several hours passed. The clock had struck midnight. But I stood still. Alone. There wasn't a soul around. People were moving away at the sight of the bloody street. And the image of a man motionless for hours with his hands covered in blood, slowly dripping on the bench, and his face disfigured by his wounds certainly didn't help. I had unwittingly created a truly terrifying scene for a mere passerby. Hers. It was her fault. She made them all afraid of me. How dare she?

Then I saw her. She must have been coming back from some night-out. I could tell by her clothes. She was stunning. Even more so than usual. Her smile was filled with delight, her eyes brighter. She was perfect.

I stayed watching her for several minutes. My gaze was glued to her as she got closer and closer to my bench. But she wasn't afraid. She wasn't walking away like the others. She was getting closer. Those who say the killer always returns to the scene of the crime are right. Why should he be afraid? She had caused all of this. She had painted the street red with my blood. I could see the pride in her eyes for her crime. I could feel the satisfaction she felt for the harm she had caused me. How dare she?

""I'm sorry, are you okay?""

I was so engrossed in every one of her small movements that I didn't realize how close she had come. She was now beside me. She had seen my scars and was asking me if I needed help. How ironic that the person responsible for my injuries would offer to help me. She was playing with me. How dare she? How could he pretend not to know? As if it wasn't her own face in that damn mirror. As if it wasn't her image that tormented me so. I decided to play too.

""I just had an accident, it's nothing"" I replied.

""What are you talking about? Look at your hands, your face! Listen, I can't leave you like this. I live nearby, do you want me to drive you to the hospital?""

""Thank you very much, but I wouldn't want to put you to any trouble...""

""I'm afraid you don't intend to go on your own. And I wouldn't want to leave you in a condition like this.""
Yeah, right. She was worried about me. Good one. I didn't expect the joke to go that far. I followed her to an apartment building a few blocks away. She had her car parked outside.

""You look nervous, why? Do you want some water first?""

I wasn't nervous. But I agreed. I had to know what she was planning. She seemed troubled. She was nervously talking. But did she mean what she said? Did she want to help? We got into an apartment on the second floor. A real dump. How could someone like her live in a place like that? Plaster ready to fall, mold, damp. I wouldn't have lasted a day there.

""Why are you doing this?"" I asked her. ""You're bringing a stranger into your home. You promise him help. Why?""

""I found you badly injured sitting alone on a bench in the cold. Don't think I like this whole thing any more than you do. Quite the opposite, to be honest. But I don't know what else I could have done, I felt you needed help.""

Help. Yeah, right. Her hypocrisy had infuriated me. First, she left me bloodied and battered, and now she wanted to help. She disgusted me. Disgusted me! I had to get her out of my life. Her and everything beautiful about her. Walking into the kitchen to get me some water, I noticed a knife on the counter. I picked it up without her seeing me and started bringing it around in my fingers. I began to observe the blade. And then I saw my reflection on it. I saw that awful yet beautiful image again. She. She looking at me with a disapproving look as if she were mocking me. Enough. The torment had to end.

I didn't waste any more time. I hit three times in the throat. On the vocal cords. I never wanted to hear her soothing voice again. I saw the terror in her eyes. The realization that her life had come to an end. How horrible. To die and not be able to make a sound. Not being able to say the last words you planned, if you even had time to plan them. To pass away knowing you're dying at the hands of a man you wanted to help. To regret even talking to him. All that and so much more I could see in her eyes. So many thoughts. So much resentment. Horror. How lucky this wasn't happening to me.

But there was one thing I didn't see in her eyes. Regret. Even in her final moments, she refused to admit the harm she'd done to me. What irony. Those eyes. Those beautiful and terrible eyes. Those eyes that led to... my habit - not obsession - of thinking about her had become the source of my hatred for her. I never wanted to see their glow again. Two more hits were enough.

She was thrashing around on the floor like a fish out of water in a desperate attempt to stay alive. She tried to scream, but couldn't. What a horrible way to die. However, I didn't feel guilty. Everyone gets what they deserve. And, oh, what satisfaction I got. Every drop of blood that spilled from her body was blood I got back for what she did to me. But I wasn't that selfish. Whatever satisfaction I got was not due to this ""revenge"" of mine. Because that wasn't revenge. Revenge is motivated by emotional factors. And she had drained me of any real feelings. Only emptiness. A memory of the person I used to be. And now she's become the same. A memory. No. This was not revenge. It was punishment.

Feeling her soul leaving her body, I may have felt a certain sense of sadness. Perhaps regret. But it was a small price to pay. The witch was dead. And every red splash on the wall brought me joy. The nightmare was over.

Some will call me crazy. Obsessive. But could a madman act as calmly as I did? With such clarity? Could a madman take her life as quietly, as calmly as I did? Could he remove the shards of the mirror from his hands one by one? Could he think clearly enough to place them inside her and rid himself of everything that reminded him of her? Could he clean the blood so carefully that nothing would give away the existence of a corpse? Could he dispose of her lifeless body as intelligently as I did? I don't think so. I wasn't crazy. I wasn't obsessed. I just had a habit. A habit I had now broken. It was over. It was all over.

The next few days passed calmly. I stopped seeing her. I stopped thinking about her. There was nothing left to remind me of her. Even the mirror I'd broken had been replaced. In its place I had put a bigger and nicer one that had a hidden locker behind it. Quite useful I must admit. Indeed, everything was perfect. Perhaps even better than before I met her. On the other hand, did I ever meet her? Was it normal that the loss of a stranger brought me such happiness? No, it was her fault, not mine. She caused this. That's what I wanted to believe.

Sometimes, of course, a disturbing thought would cross my mind. I held her lifeless body in my hands, but I never knew her name. I wonder if it was as beautiful and special as she was? I had to find out. I needed to know. And it was this need that worried me. Because some habits might not go away.

Fortunately, it didn't take long to satisfy this need and I was soon able to put her out of my mind again when I finally learned her name. I read it in the newspaper. Apparently, some of her relatives had reported her missing and the police were investigating the case. Personally, that didn't worry me. There was no evidence that I was involved in this. As I said, I had taken precautions.

The days passed and I slept more peacefully than ever. The police investigations continued as usual, but they hadn't come to any result. They weren't even sure if it was a murder. That's how well I had covered my tracks. I wasn't crazy. In fact, from what I'd heard, they were thinking of stopping the investigation and only continuing if new evidence surfaced. So far, they'd only come up with the date of the disappearance. Various neighbors had reported that they hadn't noticed any movement of either her or her car from a certain date onwards.

Shortly afterwards, someone gave information to the police about a strange figure sitting isolated from the others on a bench for hours the same day she went missing. Asking around, it didn't take long to find someone who had identified me. It is reasonable that the police wanted to question someone whose description alone was suspicious and who just happened to be for hours in a place where the victim was known to hang out. It didn't take long to get the call from the police. They wanted to ask me some questions and were going to stop by my house. I can't hide the fact that I was scared. But without a body, I couldn't be accused of anything.

I started counting the minutes. I was trying to stay calm. They couldn't know anything. I had to be fully prepared to answer any question with ease. I rehearsed in my mind every possibility. Despite the anxiety I felt deep down, I was ready for anything.

Then I heard it. The bell. They were here. They were at the door, waiting. Taking one last deep breath before the “show”, I let them in. Two policemen were at the door. They showed me their badge. It was glowing. And it almost looked like... No, I was wrong, it couldn't be. I led them into the living room, where we started talking. I answered their every question quickly and intelligently. They had no reason to doubt what I said. I even tried to maintain eye contact to show confidence. I looked at them so long that I could even see the entire room reflected in their eyes. I could even see... Nah, I was wrong.

Finishing our conversation, I picked up the now empty cups of coffee that I had offered them while they were preparing to leave. In the spoons, however, something caught my attention. In the reflection that formed in their metallic material, I could make out a familiar figure. I began to have a terrible suspicion. From the living room, I discreetly tried to look at the bathroom mirror through the half-open door. I was now certain. Cold sweat washed all over me.

My anxiety peaked when one of the two officers asked to go to the bathroom before leaving. I couldn't refuse. I led him there and he closed the door. Now I was certain. One look in the mirror would be enough. One look was enough for him to know everything. The game was over. And I had lost.

When he came out, he seemed unconcerned. I expected a different reaction. But he was smiling, too. But he knew. He couldn't not know. He was playing with me. He wanted to make me confess. It wasn't enough for him to know the truth. He wanted to make it as difficult for me as possible. Yes, that's it. He was toying with me. Everybody was playing me.

""It's time we leave. Unless you want to add something,"" he said.

He was laughing with me. He didn't show it, but I knew it. He and his partner. They both knew. They knew all along. They'd seen her. She was everywhere. There was no doubt.

""Stop! I can't take it anymore. You and everyone else! Stop playing with me! These twisted games of yours are no longer going to get through to me! Enough! I know she spoke to you. I know you saw her. I know what you're trying to do. So let's put an end to this, shall we?""

I went into the bathroom and showed him the mirror. I showed him the face in it. I showed him her. Her! Her who decided to come back to get her revenge. Or to punish me. Maybe both.

The policemen were stunned. Almost scared. They didn't know how to react. They played their part well. They acted as if they didn't know what I meant. As if they couldn't see. But I was going to show them.

""Here it is! No need to hide it! I know you've seen it. I know all about it, I'm not the crazy one. I know what you're doing! What? Don't you see? Take a good hard look!""

With all the strength I had, I broke the mirror. I broke her image.

And with nothing left to hold it back anymore, the only evidence of my guilt was free. Her head rolled out of the mirror's locker and fell to the floor.

""Guilty as charged, gentlemen!""",2,1735901160.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I want to leave some small tips for people who are still struggling with something or everything, it might be different to where you live but I can assure that most of my tips could be applied to you and I welcome helpful comments to continue this post!

1) First of all, to keep a job, you have to show up for the job and don't feel pressured by society, friends and family or others - if you can get to work by bicycle, longboard, bus or walking then do it, there's no point driving a car. Many people choose a car because that's how society is supposed to operate but that's crap, get a bike, walk, you will save few hundreds of euros or dollars. I was a hardcore car guy until I got tired that all money goes to wasting fuel in traffic jams, hence I started  biking and doing public transport and that has saved me up to 400€ a month from where I'm at (my work is 1.20h away from my home and that's crazy far

2) If you are dependant on the car, either you run a job that requires you to have a car or you live in a place where bad infrastructure is present and you cannot alternatively get to work, do not buy new car or do high percentage loans. I drive a beater car from 80's, i am fortunate enough to possess an ability to wrench myself and I bought the car for 600€ and I have yet to invest my fifth hundred in that car in servicing in many many years. Parts are cheap, oil is cheap, car is easy to fix - yes the comfort is not the best you can get but that works for me, I have no problems driving that partly because I love classic and vintage cars, but this can work for any car from mid 2000. My friend for example is getting same salary yet he is living  salary to salary from paying 700+ a month for a car, my monthly expenses are fuel, that's it and  I can go and do whatever I want, I am saving close to his monthly payments each month because I live cheap.

3) always use advantages you can get from your school, employer, medical status etc. My work offers free lunch, I don't make food after work, and I save up time, that is specifically my bonus but you might have something as well or if not, that's also okay. I work in a field, where I can get my hands on tools and tool equipment, like cleaning kits and laser engravers that out company uses occasionally. We have a lot of torque wrenches and other equipment, however my boss is kind enough to let me use all of those, with a little sweet bit of persuasion, under condition if I damage it, I pay for it or cover warranty expenses. What do I do? I sometimes lease the equipment to my close friends that are working on their stuff, cars, bikes etc., my boss doesn't know that and that is not very goo, but by doing so I get up to 100€ free from ""leasing"" not my equipment fully understanding the consequences one wrong decision could make. We do have laser engraver, I take requests from people across FB marketplace and other places to engrave stuff they need on bracelets, car key chains etc., that makes me another couple of hundred euros per month free money (that laser engraver is unkillable). All this risk has so far paid itself.

4) Food - don't be afraid to buy cheap (today's expiry date) food and make simple meals. You don't need a super huge steak each night, buy noodles, pasta, quick simple foods that get the job done, pasta with pesto, lazy burritos, fish with vegetables, salad, you won't starve. Don't buy coffee capsules and those scam machines, drink natural coffee. Try investing in a coffee machine or maybe even instant coffee if you please, I buy coffee beans on discounts and make coffee in moka pot, that's almost for free in the long term, depending on the country you're from and prices there, I for example paid 9€ for moka pot and maybe 70€ a year for coffee beans, to narrow it down that's 0.20€ per day a year for a coffee roughly (if my head calculates correctly) and depending on prices, I took my avarage price. Also try growing food at home, tomatoes, cucumbers, other spices. A lot of warm climate guys can do it all the time, I'm my country we usually grow in summer and then process for winter keeping. 

5) Electronics - you don't need the newest and best. I used old phone (recently I allowed myself a treat for how good I was past year and bought a refurbished z flip 5 as a Christmas gift, same amount of warranty and coverage, except I don't get to open box and take off film from screen) partly because I have only reddit and whatsapp on my phone cause I don't let myself get poisoned by fake illusions on instagram etc., Facebook is strictly on computer only. My laptop is 2014 Macbook air, emails, work chats, meetings and Internet, it works perfect and I don't see reason to update anytime soon. For mid 20's like myself, gaming? Well, I got a ps5 on contact, in my country from operators you can get very flexible with terms so I got it on 3 months pay, no percentage added you pay only for device. I could afford that so I figured why not. By living like a homeless I have saved up crazy amount so why not use it. Note that it's what I've saved for few years and not from last month savings. I still have left enough to buy a 10y old car but I don't spend it, it's a matter of your wants vs needs, altho I wanted the ps5 😁

6) Clothes - I've never owned a expensive brand clothes. I was poor in childhood and used to go to second hand clothing stores and  I still go there, I buy good quality boots for winter, random Aliexpress type cheap jackets etc I simply don't care. I do own Vans shoes they have special place in my heart, but like that prada gucci is nonsense to me. 

7) housing  - well, you gotta do what you gotta do unfortunately. If you don't have spare room in parents house or friends to rent with, rent will be hard especially in the USA from what I've heard. I live with my gf and we manage very good in a two small room  apartment that's like maybe 40 square meters  (I don't know how much bald eagles per f16 that will be). We buy cheap furniture in our rental, 30€ IKEA table will do the same job as 2k designer one, due to me being crafty af I have built shelves from old plywood and it looks good + it's solid. We also have bicycles, I built my own for about 120€ and it's solid and drive in winter and summer. I was on business trip in the Netherlands and brought a bicycle there, I got it back to my country because we had a shipment going back home and I asked my boss if I can throw the bicycle in the back of the truck, mission success and I have a old 1933 bicycle now.

In few short years I've become 10k loan free, saved up and went from almost living on the street to renting, got my health up and experienced few job promotions. Maybe this is just my success story that I hope will continue, but I believe that if my lazy ass can do it, you won't have problems too. Each of us can find a way, there's no need to ask fish to climb trees, fish needs to be thought  swimming. Guys, I wish you a good swim! 

Anyway, these were very fast tips for someone who could be interested, very long read and I apologise  for that and for my potato English. I really hope this will be useful to someone and I will be more than happy to answer some questions. ",3,1735900904.0,povertyfinance,0,1.0,False

1. Would using hot chocolate and coffee powder mixed in water and a splash of orange juice make a good dunking liquid or is that too much flavours (I might cut out the coffee, wouldn’t really a tiramisu anymore but yk whatever)
2. For the custard if I made like 3 batches and added food dye and then mixed them together (but not homogenise, basically like a marble cake) would that make multicolour tiramisu or would all the colours just mix in the fridge and u get gross brown tiramisu.
3. How hard is it to make ur own sponge fingers (called lady fingers in the US), I saw some guy make circular tiramisu by making like a circular plate of sponge fingers and I wanna do that but they only sell sponge fingers as… fingers so I might just buy sponge fingers and make it rectangular.

1hsjoqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1hsjoqa/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.
