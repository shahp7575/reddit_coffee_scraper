1hu3omw,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hu3omw/cold_turkey_day_5/,Cold turkey day 5,"I've been drinking way too much coffee everyday for at least 20 years. I have sleep problems and knew the 3-4 cups of coffee everyday couldn't be helping. There are other symptoms which I suspect are caffeine related and I think to myself I need to quit all the time, just not today. 

About a year ago I got an infection and barely left the bed for 2 weeks. I was miserable anyway and the caffeine detox got lumped in with fever and all the other symptoms of my illness. I was taking pain relievers throughout the whole ordeal.When I got better I was so relieved to be off caffeine too. I made it about 3 more weeks and honestly don't know why I even went back to drinking coffee at that point. I was expecting my sleep to be better than it was, so that may have been part of it. I definitely missed the ritual and flavor of drinking coffee every morning like I had been doing since my teens.

Since then I've tried tapering but never make it past a week or 2 before I just start going back and drinking as much as I feel like. I decided to go cold turkey on January 1. 

First day I got a mild headach and I was super tired. Much the same the next day, but then the hip and lower back pain started. I've seen several other posts on this subreddit where people had the same weird issue. It is excruciating. Ibuprofen helps and it is the only way I can sleep or function at all. I'm a runner and am familiar with this tightness from over training. A few times I've planned a route and got lost, and ended up running way further than I set out to. Stretching would alleviate that somewhat and the pain was minor. This tightness is not the same. It's almost like a muscle spasm that comes on slow and gets worse and worse until the ibuprofen kicks in. Definitely did not expect this. I'm just glad I've made it this far and hopefully the pain of withdrawal will help me stay off caffeine long term.

1hu3of8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBSResearch/comments/1hu3of8/it_seemed_like_irritable_bowel_syndrome_but_it/,"It seemed like irritable bowel syndrome, but it was bile acid malabsorption","Hello, I’m sharing my story because I’m sure there are others in the same situation as me, searching for information online, and this might help them. Here’s my case. Before I begin, I want to clarify that I’m not a doctor, and everything I share here is based on internet research and my personal experience.



It all started about 15 years ago, when I was 20. Until then, my health was perfect, including my digestive system. I’d even say it was too perfect – I never had emergencies, rarely reacted badly to food, and was completely regular and predictable. Then one day, I had an urgent need to go to the bathroom, and things never went back to normal. At first, I thought it was due to irritating foods like coffee or spicy dishes. Later, I suspected I might be celiac, so I took multiple tests (including a biopsy), all of which came back negative. Nonetheless, I tried a gluten-free diet, which seemed to work for a few days before everything went back to being just as bad as before. I had diarrhea every day, especially in the mornings and after meals. Fortunately, I didn’t experience pain, but I did have constant urgency. My obsession was being near a bathroom. Then I underwent lactose intolerance tests, which also came back negative. The only thing I noticed that slightly improved my situation was eating very little.



I visited countless doctors and gastroenterologists who told me I had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and that since I didn’t have issues with specific foods, the cause was likely psychological. They would ask if I was stressed, and my answer was always no. I knew I wasn’t because I was living a normal life, just like anyone else, without major problems.



I lived in this state of uncertainty for about 15 years, alternating between periods of visiting doctors and conducting extensive research on my own, without success, and periods of resignation. I assumed this was my new reality and the only way to continue living was to rely on coping mechanisms such as eating very little, staying near bathrooms, avoiding leaving the house early, forcing myself to go to the bathroom multiple times before going out, and declining invitations to activities involving walking, car rides, or any transportation without access to a bathroom to avoid a horrible experience.



Going out for a simple walk on a weekend morning became a torture, because even after going to the bathroom at home, an urgent situation could arise at any moment. And let’s not even talk about eating a cookie or any food while away from a bathroom.



About a year ago, I returned to one of those phases of self-research. I had already resigned myself to the idea that a doctor wouldn’t provide a solution. If I was going to find one, it would be by chance or by stumbling upon the right information online. My main hypothesis was that some group of foods was causing harm, but I couldn’t determine which ones. It’s true that I had already tried many diets, eliminating processed foods for several days, avoiding foods with flour, cutting out sugar, dairy, etc. Nothing seemed to help. But I kept wondering: what if I was doing it wrong? What if I wasn’t eliminating the right food? Another possibility was that there was some disorder in my system that could be treated with medication, rather than food. I had tried various medications for IBS that could provide relief for a day, but nothing offered permanent improvement or could be considered a lasting treatment.



A mix of luck, attention, and persistence led me to hear a streamer named Oliver Nabani (who talks about technology, not health-related topics) mention that he has IBS but also diabetes, and how glucose spikes and their impact on bile acids cause disorders. I didn’t fully understand at the time, but the idea of researching bile acids stuck with me. I came across a British woman’s story similar to mine (though hers was more extreme) where she had been misdiagnosed with IBS for 14 years before discovering she had BAM (Bile Acid Malabsorption):



\[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LoAkfuvFww\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LoAkfuvFww)



Digging deeper, I found this video from a Spanish medical center discussing IBS and bile acid diarrhea:



\[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGZqP-U3xyw\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGZqP-U3xyw)



To make a long story short, since the information on BAM matched my symptoms, I managed to find a doctor who prescribed cholestyramine to test its effects. I want to clarify again that I’m not a doctor; I’m just sharing my experience. While the recommended diagnostic test is the SeHCAT scan, if access to it isn’t available, trying the medication and observing the results can be an alternative.



I finally bought cholestyramine, which comes in sachets to be dissolved in water. I take a 4-gram sachet every morning on an empty stomach, and that’s it. The results have been very positive. I’ve been taking it for nearly a year, and it has literally changed my life. Things aren’t perfectly back to how they were before I turned 20, but they’re very close. The number of times I need to go to the bathroom each day has greatly decreased. I no longer have the type of diarrhea I used to, which was light brown (almost golden) with a distinct and penetrating smell.



Most importantly, this substantial improvement has been sustained for nearly a year, leading me to conclude that my body wasn’t reabsorbing bile acids properly, causing irritation and bile acid diarrhea. My simplified understanding is that this medication (cholestyramine) encapsulates part of the bile acids, preventing them from reaching the large intestine in large amounts, which would otherwise cause irritation and the symptoms I described earlier.



If you’re in a similar situation, I recommend researching extensively online. In my experience, doctors generally don’t pay enough attention to IBS cases. I spent many years seeing different doctors, and none of them ever thought to test me for BAM. They might have saved me years of discomfort.



BAM is very characteristic of people who’ve had their gallbladder removed, but it’s not exclusive to them. People like me, who still have their gallbladder, can also suffer from it.



Questions I still have:



\- What triggers BAM in a person? I don’t know. From one day to the next, my system started changing. Whether it was an infection, a triggering food, or something else, I’ll never know.



\- Why aren’t doctors more aware of this diagnosis for IBS patients? I don’t know either. I want to believe it’s a relatively recent discovery and will take time to become widely known, but I’m sure a significant percentage of people suffering from IBS could solve their problem by taking this medication.



\- Are there any side effects to taking cholestyramine long-term? I’m not sure. Like any medication, it must have some side effects, but life was much more miserable before finding it.



\- Are there other medications that work for this? They say Liraglutide also showed positive effects for bile acid diarrhea. I have a close relative who suffered from similar intestinal problems and started taking Liraglutide for diabetes-related issues. As a side effect, they noticed incredible improvement in intestinal function. My opinion is that this relative also had undiagnosed BAM.





I hope this helps someone.

but every time i talk about my struggles with anorexia, i stop myself. like im such a fucking fake anorexic because i can somewhat eat now. that ive gained weight back. that i'm not actively dying anymore

i hate to say it! dying was fun! it was terrifying, but dying was so fun because i knew i was at rock bottom! how can you get skinnier when your heart is giving out? i was in my prime! i loved the concerned looks, the way people looked revolted by me. stores would give me free foods (those small family chains) and a local coffee shop would always give me a large (filled to the brim) milkshake when i ordered a small once in a blue moon (and would give me them for free if i walked past). these would make me freak out but it was so fun knowing i was revolting! its selfish and awful of me because i know my size scared people.

but now i'm normal. now i'm just some girl with an anorexic history but i can't even match the diagnosis anymore because i had to go and recover. i cant talk to other anorexics or anyone with an ED for that matter because its like i barely had it.

barely would be wrong - i have a multitude of bone and heart issues from my starvation, alongside a head injury from collapsing that rendered me with a minor traumatic brain injury. but still.

anyways rant over! i feel like such a stupidly fake anorexic and yet i cant say i have a good relationship with food yet. i'm in a limbo and i don't know where to go",2,1736071503.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False

So it’s day three and so far so good. 
I’m a huge sugar addict and I’m honestly amazed that I managed to not eat any sweets for three days. Hope my motivation lasts.

I’m doing this challenge to get back into running. Haven’t been on a run since August 2024. Two covid infections later here I am, still coughing, but I’ll start slowly running again around next week. Focussing on strength training in the meantime (bouldering/gym).

I’ve really let myself go diet wise. Basically living on one normal meal a day plus several mars bars, snickers and m&ms for months didn’t do my health any favours.
Diabetes runs in the family and I’ve started noticing pre diabetes symptoms in myself. 

The plan:

(7/7) read 20 pages daily. The book must either be a classic or the author must be the winner of a relevant literature prize (pulitzer/nobel/national literature award etc)

(6/7) protein dense diet. No sweets, no added sugar. One sugar free soda per day allowed. One cheat day per week (could be a dessert or an alcoholic drink in a social setting)

(7/7) drink 3l of water (I’m counting unsweetened tea or black coffee in this. can’t quit sweets AND caffeine cold turkey. I’m only human)

(6/7) 45+ min workout (bouldering/gym/cycling/running). One active rest day per week allowed (long walk/yoga/ home workout etc)

(1/7) private progress foto once a week

1hu3jih,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1hu3jih/stop_babysitting_your_weak_mind_heres_the_30day/,Stop Babysitting Your Weak Mind – Here’s the 30-Day Mental Bootcamp to Dominate 2025,"  




You’re not tired – your brain’s just soft. The mental fatigue you feel isn’t real. It’s brainrot from consuming low-level dopamine all day like it’s oxygen. I spent the last 60 days testing extreme measures to obliterate my mental fog and level up. What I found wasn’t in your self-help books. It’s in the trenches of discomfort.

You want a sharper mind? Stop coddling it. Here’s the 30-day mental reset that rebuilt me from the ground up.

**The Non-Negotiables:**

Cold Showers – Immediate Reboot  
You’ve heard it before. But you’re still avoiding it. Start with 30 seconds. By day 10, you’ll crave 2-minute ice showers. You’re not just “waking up” – you’re killing the weak version of yourself with every breath.

Digital Carnage – Delete, Don’t Organize  
I deleted every saved post, bookmark, and tab. Your brain is suffocating under “to-read later” trash. Delete it all. Your mind needs space to think, not hoard.

Caffeine Upgrade – Green Tea + L-Theanine  
Coffee made me feel like a stock trader on cocaine by noon. Switched to green tea and L-theanine. Same buzz, zero crash. Your focus extends, and you feel clean.

**The Silent Killers:**

Dopamine Detox Sundays  
No screens. No scrolling. Just you and your thoughts. First 3 Sundays felt like prison. Now? It’s sacred. Let your brain detox. Creativity flows when you embrace boredom.

Box Breathing – Stop the Overload  
Forget meditation apps. Google “box breathing.” 4 seconds in, hold, 4 seconds out. It’s a 2-minute circuit breaker for overthinking.

Lock the Phone – Literally  
Bought a phone lockbox. 4-hour lock during work. No excuses. Your brain fights back hard – let it. You’ll return to focus like a monk.

**Social Media Detox Without Full Deletion:**

Grayscale your phone. Instagram looks like a Soviet documentary now.

Unfollow dopamine leeches. If it doesn’t teach or inspire, it’s gone.

Turn off all notifications. I get notified for texts or calls. That’s it.

**Next-Level Hacks:**

Nasal Breathing at Night  
Mouth breathing = brain fog. I taped my mouth shut at night (look it up). I wake up like a machine now. Sleep quality went nuclear.

Lion’s Mane Supplements  
Memory boost isn’t instant. But after 3 weeks, I felt laser-focused. Stack it with proper sleep – your recall skyrockets.

90-Minute Work Blocks  
Ultradian rhythms – your brain works in cycles. 90 min focus, 20 min break. Repeat. Stop burning out after 6 hours.

**The Underrated (But Brutal) Upgrades:**

Posture Fix – Your slouching is killing your brain circulation. Buy a laptop stand and fix your damn chair.

Vision Check – Minor eye issues I didn’t know I had were draining my energy. Got glasses, brain fog dropped 80%.

Binaural Beats – Sound hack. Put on beats while working. It’s not hippie crap – it recalibrates your focus.

Chew Gum – Yes, it’s that simple. Chewing gum while working boosts blood flow to the brain. Silly? Maybe. Effective? 100%.

**Final Boss Mode:**  
Write down everything spinning in your head before bed. Call it a “mind dump.” I stopped staring at the ceiling at night. Sleep is deeper, sharper, and my mornings are unstoppable.

Don’t just read this – start today. You won’t feel ready. That’s the point. If you execute even half of this, you’ll walk into 2025 mentally dangerous – and everyone else will still be stuck googling “how to focus.”",3,1736071198.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

Tbh I've hit a brick wall on every personal or portfolio project I've started for far too long, which is why im posting on this fresh Reddit account to hopefully get me out of my echo chamber.

Looking for critiques on the logo mark, not the layout.

The logo itself was inspired by the shape of a classic filter coffee jug and a lot of logo marks commonly found stamped or painted onto machines, tools and companies. More specifically the visual inspiration came from 60s-70s American industrial machines, tools and companies.

The company targets individuals who value form that follows function. These individuals might buy things like vintage workwear, things made from sustainably strong materials such as wood or metal and don't mind paying a premium for something they deem quality. These people dislike products with planned obsolescence, wasteful packaging and the state of consumerism.

I'd love to hear what you think of the branding and I'd love to hear if this is way too much context for a Reddit post.

I’m a freelancer for already 2 years. 

I miss the social aspect since my job allows me to work a lot from home. In the beginning it went great (amazing focus), but I really miss social contact and the feeling of a “community” around you. My job is in external sales, so working for different clients. 

What you need to know:
I like it busy and social, since my job is calling a lot as well. 

I tried a co working before, but everyone had their office box and the atmosphere was just, well respectfully, very grey and “corporate”. everyone in their own bubbel, except during lunch hours. I’m not going to mention the place, since the facilities were amazing, but was boring as hell. 

My main question:

I’m looking for a fun and outgoing place to work, with like minded people. Where:

- Calls arent a problem
- There is a fun, young and open space or community. No problem with it being noisy at all! The more dynamic, the more pleasure - workjoy for me
- regio Ghent, Bruges, preferrable

Anyone experience as well working in coffee bars or public spaces? I always got the idea owners hate it, but never tried it.

I accidentally left my bag on my seat and realized it when the train was already moving. Luckily, I managed to retrieve my bag,(missed my stop)but what happened next left me uncomfortable.

One of the railway waiters was helpful and told me not to worry. He even offered me coffee and tea, which I declined. However, things took a weird turn when he asked for my phone number, saying he'd help me if any issues arose during the journey.

I gave it to him, thinking he was genuinely trying to assist. But then, he started asking personal questions - my name, if I had a boyfriend, and if my phone was for personal use only. I was taken aback by his intrusive queries, and my instincts told me something was off.
To make matters worse, he told me to call him when I reached home(also said-tum samajh rhi ho na kya bolna chahta hu) and asked me not to tell this to my parents or to anyone else. I was relieved when I finally got off the train at the next station.I immediately blocked his number as soon I got off the train.

As a young solo female traveler, I've experienced similar incidents frequently while traveling by train. To be honest, it's made me wary of train travel. If possible, I recommend opting for flights. If you do take the train, consider booking a seat in the 1st AC boggy, which tends to be safer.

1hu3bez,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1hu3bez/help_me/,Help me :(,"Since August 2024, I have been SUFFERING with the non-ability to take a shit. I use to poop every single day or every other day after coffee. Or even just naturally w/o coffee, whatever. I ended up in the hospital on August 5th 2024 RANDOMLY for being 10 days constipated. It was the most uncomfortable physical pain I’ve endured up to date, one I must never relive again. The ER doctor did a CT Scan & I wasn’t even severely backed up - only “moderately”. Since then, I am not able to poop without using laxatives. 

I met my deductible, so I’ve been back and forth to the GI doctor 10x since then and a Holistic doctor. I did a colonoscopy - everything looked great. I did a stool test - everything looked great. With the holistic doctor I did a more advanced stool test for my gut - my gut is normal. 

It’s been now 6 months of this torture with no answers. I’ve tried Miralax every day in the beginning and it worked for a month - then stopped working. Now I am taking stimulant to go.

Plot twist - so I am unsure if this is even IBS because if I don’t poop for one day, I am in physical agony. It feels like there is 10 bricks of shit stuck in my stomach when that’s literally not the case. I HAVE to poop everyday so I can feel comfortable, something I never dealt with in my life. 

Also, I eat like a pigeon. Whatever this monster is I can only tolerate soft foods. Anything hard (like a gluten free pizza, chicken, beef) I will not be able to poop even with the stimulant. I can tolerate potato’s, eggs, soft veggies,  dips/chips, very soft gf tacos, soups, smoothies, soft desserts, etc. low fod map barely works. I also have to cut back what I eat too because the quality affects things as well. 

I have to plan my life around my pooping schedule. It’s hard to do anything. Even Linzess barely works.

I don’t get bloated but with my symptoms mentioned, do you think this could be methane SIBO? I got the test kit but I have to wait to take it because I was on an antibiotic.

1hu39tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1hu39tr/the_forgotten_mourning/, The Forgotten Mourning ,"
I sit at the kitchen table, sipping coffee from the chipped mug my wife, Claire, always hated. The morning light filters through the window, painting golden stripes across the hardwood floor. Claire hums softly as she moves around the kitchen, her back to me. She’s wearing that faded blue apron she swore she’d throw out but never did.

It’s a peaceful moment, one I’ve come to treasure in our quiet life together.

“Did you sleep okay?” I ask.

She pauses, hand lingering over the kettle, but doesn’t turn around. “Mm-hmm,” she murmurs. Her voice is distant, almost muffled.

I notice her hand trembles slightly. “You sure? You look pale today,” I say, frowning.

She laughs softly, the sound thin and brittle. “You always worry too much.”

Something about the laugh sends a shiver through me, but I push it aside. Claire’s been under the weather before, and she always bounces back.

The clock on the wall ticks loudly, each second stretching into an eternity.

“Did you get the mail yesterday?” I ask, trying to fill the silence.

She doesn’t respond.

“Claire?”

Still no answer.

I stand, my chair scraping against the floor, and walk toward her. My chest tightens with unease as I notice her shoulders are unnaturally stiff.

“Claire, are you feeling okay?” I place a hand gently on her shoulder.

She doesn’t move.

Slowly, she turns her head to look at me, and I feel the air leave my lungs. Her face is gaunt, pale, and hollow, like a wax figure left too long in the sun. Her eyes—once vibrant and full of life—are dull, cloudy, and empty.

My hand jerks back instinctively, and I stumble away. “What’s wrong? What’s happening to you?”

She tilts her head, her expression unreadable. “What’s wrong with you?” she whispers.

Her words echo in my head, but they don’t make sense.

I blink, and suddenly, the kitchen is empty. Claire is gone. The chair where she’d been sitting is covered in dust, and the blue apron hangs limply on the back of the door, untouched.

The silence is deafening.

I stagger back, gripping the edge of the table for support. My mind races, grasping for answers. The coffee in my mug is cold, congealed. The clock on the wall has stopped.

And then it hits me.

Claire’s been gone for years.

I remember the funeral—the black dress, the sobs of friends and family, the sound of dirt hitting her coffin.

But how? How could I have forgotten?

My knees buckle, and I sink to the floor. Images flood my mind: the accident, the hospital room, her lifeless body. I’d locked it away, buried it deep, refused to face the pain.

For years, I’ve been living in a house filled with echoes, clinging to a ghost.

Tears stream down my face as I look at the empty chair.

“Claire,” I whisper. “I’m so sorry.”

The room is still, but in the silence, I swear I hear her voice.

“It’s okay,” she says softly, her tone filled with sadness. “But you need to let me go.”

And then she’s gone.

This time, for good.

I use to poop every single day or every other day after coffee. Or even just naturally w/o coffee, whatever. I ended up in the hospital on August 5th 2024 RANDOMLY for being 10 days constipated. It was the most uncomfortable physical pain I’ve endured up to date, one I must never relive again. The ER doctor did a CT Scan & I wasn’t even severely backed up - only “moderately”. Since then, I am not able to poop without using laxatives. 

I met my deductible, so I’ve been back and forth to the GI doctor 10x since then and a Holistic doctor. I did a colonoscopy - everything looked great. I did a stool test - everything looked great. With the holistic doctor I did a more advanced stool test for my gut - my gut is normal. 

It’s been now 6 months of this torture with no answers. I’ve tried Miralax every day in the beginning and it worked for a month - then stopped working. Now I am taking stimulant to go.

Plot twist - so I am unsure if this is even IBS because if I don’t poop for one day, I am in physical agony. It feels like there is 10 bricks of shit stuck in my stomach when that’s literally not the case. I HAVE to poop everyday so I can feel comfortable, something I never dealt with in my life. 

Also, I eat like a pigeon. Whatever this monster is I can only tolerate soft foods. Anything hard (like a gluten free pizza, chicken, beef) I will not be able to poop even with the stimulant. I can tolerate potato’s, eggs, soft veggies,  dips/chips, very soft gf tacos, soups, smoothies, soft desserts, etc. low fod map barely works. I also have to cut back what I eat too because the quality affects things as well. 

I have to plan my life around my pooping schedule. It’s hard to do anything. Even Linzess barely works.

I don’t get bloated but with my symptoms mentioned, do you think this could be methane SIBO? I got the test kit but I have to wait to take it because I was on an antibiotic.

We have always had a lot of things in common: we are both from the same small town, we both have abusive families of origin to vent about, and we both enjoy arts and crafts. I attended her wedding and she attended mine when the time came.

The differences following that became increasingly significant. She's married to an abusive man, while I married a kind man (out of pure luck). Also, I've been taking many years of therapy, and she hasn't (not for lack of trying, but her emotionally abusive pothead of a husband is an absent father, so no help there with taking a couple of hours a week to talk to someone).

We each gave birth to a son and started having play dates together. We had a great time with this setup for almost 10 years, with play dates occurring almost weekly.

Our friendship worked great up to the point where her son started acting with my son the way his dad was acting with him. My son would get the silent treatment out of the blue, her son would yell, belittle my son, start drama over toys. On a rare occasion when her husband was home for our play date at their place, I saw it clearly. I had an epiphany, if you will, about the origin of her son's behaviors.

She agrees she should divorce her husband, but nothing ever happens.

I talked to her about her son's behaviors, and she became fiercely defensive. She was insulted I'd imply her son would be a bad influence - she was especially sensitive about her husband's pot smoking, which drives her crazy. My boundaries were less about the potential of cultivating addiction, and more about emotional dysfunction and abuse between our children. 


I want to protect myself and my child. Play dates with other children give me the chance to decompress rather than be on boundary watch. 

Parenting as a cycle breaker is hard enough without addiction and abusers in the mix. AITA for refusing to go on play dates with her any more?

Am I going crazy?","A few years ago, I bought a used Rancilio Silvia and a Eureka Mignon Perfetto on sale to get started with making espresso. I love that setup for espresso, and my partner and I enjoy a cortado every morning.

I chose the Perfetto because it was designed for espresso but also gave me an easy way to switch between espresso and French Press on the weekends.

Now, I’ve slowly started experimenting with pour over. I have an April Brewer and a cheap gooseneck kettle. However, I often experience the brew stalling, and it’s hard to get down to shorter brew times without using a grind size close to French Press.

I’m also getting tired of having to purge coffee when switching between filter and espresso — especially when I use the hopper (which I like using during the week so I can make use of the timer function).

In addition, my girlfriend and I enjoy classic espresso flavors — which the Perfetto does really well! But for filter, I prefer modern, lighter roasts.

I’ve been looking at getting a Comandante C40 — but will I notice a difference in brewing? Will I taste a difference between the two grinders? Will I get fewer fines and reduce the risk of my pour-over stalling? Is it worth it?

(Long) ,"Hi, all fake names here, sorry if this is all over the place and messy. I am L (22 F) and this took place when I was 18 years old. I am a Christian and I went to a Christian high school (this is relevant). Here is some context. In my Junior year, I met June who at the time was 19. We became fast friends, she was a very energetic, extroverted, and joyful person much like myself. We loved theater and were both a little boy crazy and also bonded over our faith. She seemed to be close to God even though she had a lot of struggles in her life. We hung out ALL the time in and out of school. 

I should have noticed the early red flags (trash-talking others, always having some sort of drama) but didn't and I faced the consequences.

 My Senior year of high school is when everything went to hell. I have several mental health problems (OCD, GAD, MDD) and they all came to a head that year. I would sit in classes mumbling to myself and crying because the thoughts in my head were so loud and distressing and I couldn't get any help because no one knew what was going on (I was diagnosed later that year). I tried everything to make it better, I obsessed unhealthily with reading the Bible and praying but instead of seeing God's love for me all I could focus on were the thoughts that I was going to die young and that I didn't know where I was headed after death. I drowned myself in music, didn't help. I tried vaping for the first time which led to an addiction I am still battling today, but it didn't help. In any moment of peace, I would freak out because being anxious had become the norm. I was looking for anything to stop the thoughts and bring any relief. Then it hit me... more like the devil attacked so freak him, if I want a distraction and to stop thinking why not try sex. 

In comes John. 

John was an old friend who had come back into my life. I had attraction and he had attraction so I suggested we hang out. I hate myself to this day for using a friendship to try and cope with my pain but back to the story. As a young woman in a Christian school, It was DRILLED into my head that sex before marriage is a huge no-no and I believed that, so when one thing led to another and I lost my V-card that night I panicked. After a few others I called a friend to help give me an excuse to leave his place and go home. I sobbed the entire way home feeling dirty, a user, a horrible friend (which at the moment I was), and just broken. The thoughts didn't go away, I ruined a friendship, and even more broken than before. Another one of the ""world"" solutions that just screwed me up more.  I got home and broke down to my parents (who thought I was sleeping over with a friend) and told them everything but I got off track a bit, back to June. 

I messaged June before anyone to try and get help because I knew I just screwed up, bad. I needed help, support, a kind word but what I go instead was (paraphrased) this, 

""L what is wrong with you why the hell would you do that."" 

Safe to say I didn't message back. 

The following months after that night were some of the hardest of my life. I started getting help for my mental health but it was a hard hard road. I had a psychiatrist tell me that I should go sleep around more to ""find myself,"" prescribe me a medicine that caused my hair to fall out without a warning, and a misdiagnosis. But that wasn't near the worst of it. 

  
I get a text from my ex-boyfriend Tim. 

""L, I can't believe you would do this, how could you betray me like this, etc."" 

I was dumbfounded. I thought two things at once

1. We were broken up so I didn't betray him 

2. June told him. 

I immediately called June and confronted her on why she went and told my ex about that night. Her response was simple and cold. ""... He needed to know."" 

I am a relatively kind person. But I saw red in that moment. 

I yelled back at her that it was none of his business to know because we weren't together, that I trusted her in my lowest moment and all she did was berate me (like I didn't berate myself enough), and it was not her right to tell anyone my business and she COULD NOT share my business with anyone else. She said ok, and I stupidly believed her. 

2 weeks later my mom comes into my room angrier than I have ever seen her. My sweet, joyful, funny, loves everyone mother was pissed. She told me that she just got a call from my ride or die to this very day best friend Ruth's mom just called her. She said that rumors were going around about me and that no matter what they would always love me and never see me differently. 

I called Ruth and finally told her everything that happened and then asked how she knew. She said that she had gone and gotten coffee with June and she alluded to everything. 

I said thank you to Ruth and hung up. 

I called June again and told her that I was done. She had betrayed my trust once before and I gave her a chance and she blew it. Our friendship expired. Member card revoked. She was no longer welcome in my life and although I will be able to forgive her I won't forget. I hung up not wanting to hear anything more.

Years have passed and I am still finding more and more people she has told and at this point, I'm not surprised. I don't hide my mistake and I use it in my story about how God and medicine truly helped me out of that dark place. 

June tries almost every year to try and get me back in her life. She posts photos of us saying, ""I miss my best friend,"" and other stuff like that but I ignore it. I almost let her back in my life but my TRUE friends slapped some sense into me. 

June thinks I should have moved on from this incident since I am living a good life and have been brought out of the dark place I was in. She acts as if nothing ever happened. 

By no means am I a perfect person. I have hurt people in awful ways and still regret how I treated and used John every day. But I don't think that I should ever let June into my life again. 

  
So. AITAH for cutting off one of my best friends after she betrayed me at my lowest moment?

 Clarification: I am thankful for how God got me through this mistake of mine and I learned who my true friends were in these times and I am so thankful to them and Him. My parents were disappointed in the moment but did nothing but comfort and love me. They showed me how pure familial love can be and how much God can still love me through my mistakes. I am forever grateful to them and they have done everything to help me grow and become a better person.

I originally sent this collection off to my editor over three years ago. Three years! Wow, what procrastination.

On my part, that is. He had it back in my hands within a week. One reason why I have dedicated this book to him.

It originally included a fairly long story about a modern visit to an old battlefield and I promised the final chapter in a few days. Still haven’t written it.

That’s an upcoming project, along with another Carrielle Watson story set in France. There are versions of these to be found in Medium, if you look.

I made up the shortfall with a couple of more recent efforts. My story of PTSD and Melbourne cafés - *Laneway Coffee* \- and the story included in a spec fic anthology in 2023 - *This is Spärkle Tap* \- both of which are among my favourites.

I now have to “unpublish” both of these to comply with the Kindle Select requirements. Sorry.

I’m not much of a one for big launch productions - unlike the amazing [Scarlet Ibis James](https://www.scarletibisjames.com/) \- and this project is one for the long haul, anyway. I expect it will find readers as my opus grows.

It’s not really erotica. The closest I get to real sex action is *Finding a Frankfurter in Frankfurt*, and the ”bad sex” of the title is mostly teasing.

For my erotica project I’m going to have to change gears. Less wordplay, subtlety, and teasing, more “in your face” bits jiggling and grinding. I hope my readers are up for it. Hell, I hope I can handle it. It’s going to be hard.

I promised a cover reveal, and now you’ve got it. The book will be available in ebook and print editions on the third of January

I can make free copies available for review purposes. Just ask nicely!

Right. From now on, I’m fighting a battle. Mostly with my lazy self. I’ve got stories to write!

My (34F) husband (37M) of 2 years was caught having an “emotional affair” in the summer with someone who he managed at work, who was 10 years younger than him. He was messaging her constantly, flirting with her and took her on a number of dinner dates and a weekend day out. All this while he pulled away from me telling me he was “depressed”. To make matters worse we had begun looking to buy our first house and he pushed us to work on our savings so I gave up things like my Spotify account and takeaway coffee - all while he was splurging on fancy dinners for her. I found out as I found a secret insta account to talked to her and confronted him over it at which point he told me “he had been miserable with me” but had never ever shared this with me prior. Of course he begged for me to forgive him but in the meantime I decided to tell hr as I found the behaviour disgraceful and he lost his mind at me “for ruining his life”. There was an investigation at work but it came to nothing and he kept his job and is highly regarded - he still works with this girl btw.

We worked on things in marriage counselling (his decision to go and find someone to talk to) but he has spent months being furiously angry at what I did by telling hr and barely acknowledges he did anything wrong. I have spent months making space for him to calm down and talk to me about things but he just has gotten more and more angry at me, and while breadcrumbing me with hopes of our relationship (having sex, buying me gifts, spending quality time together but all when he feels like it, not on my terms) he has shown no respect for me or my boundaries in terms of his job - continued to go for drinks after work despite me sharing how upset it makes me etc. He gaslit me into thinking I am crazy if he does stay out with work. I know I have been treated so badly and have held on in the hopes that once he calmed down he would see what he has done and he would realise what we still have but my hopes are rapidly fading and I am so terrified of being alone and also consumed with grief for the person I have lost. The man I married was so open and loving and I truly believed we were soulmates and would be together until one of us passed. It’s so hard to reconcile that person with the person in front of me now.

He decided he needed space and went to his parents a few weeks ago as I was “toxic” to be around, and left me completely on my own for Christmas which hit me hard (and yet bought me lots of gifts for Christmas and took me for dinner before Christmas and told me he cared about me and was very attracted to me).

I don't even know where to start. I know this may eventually be a funny anecdote, but right now I just feel bad and a bit sad, to be honest.

I (31 F) went on a date with someone (34 M) I met on a dating app. It was a coffee date. I was nervous, and I can be very shy when I first meet a guy, but I tried to do my best, making conversation and asking this guy questions about his life, the things he likes, etc. Instead of looking at me while I talked, he kept looking at the sides, like the walls of the cafe? It may have been because he was shy, but this made me uncomfortable. Then in midsentence when I was telling him something, he just stood up and said, ""Wait, I need to use the bathroom."" It could have been an emergency, so I would understand, but I felt like he was bored by what I was telling him.

Okay, I was uncomfortable by that time, but we finished our coffees and decided to go on a walk. There were no parks nearby, so we started walking around the neighborhood, and suddenly he asked me, ""why do you walk like that?"" and I said, ""huh?"". He replied ""I don't know, you walk weird..."" and started imitating me. Apparently, my way of walking on the sidewalks was weird to him, but not funny or cute, just weird. 
He went on to say that I reminded him of something from Monty Python, where all the people walk in a strange way? I'm not exactly sure what that was because by then, I was too embarrassed and overthinking. I just laughed and said ""I didn't know I walk like that."" Honestly, I probably should have told him that I didn't feel okay with his imitation of me (mind you, it lasted for a while), but I'm the kind of person who avoids conflict, even if it means not telling the other person I don't like what they're doing, so I guess it's something I should work on.

I don’t check my phone until the caffeine kicks in, so it wasn’t until I sat down with my mug that I noticed something… wrong.

My phone said January 4th. Not April. January. My heart skipped a beat. I thought my phone had glitched or something, but then I looked at my whiteboard calendar in my room. It was filled in up to January, and four days were already crossed out.

At first, I thought maybe I’d gotten the dates mixed up somehow, or I’d been sleep-deprived for a few days. But NINE months? That’s impossible, right? I started panicking. Did I black out the last nine months of my life?

I grabbed my phone and checked my group chats, servers, DMs—anything to piece things together. According to my messages, I’d been living my life like normal this entire time. But here’s the thing: some of the replies didn’t sound like me. It wasn’t glaringly obvious, just little things. Phrases I wouldn’t use. Jokes that didn’t feel like mine. I wrote it off at first—thought maybe I’d been having a rough patch mentally.

Then I started noticing things in my room. My space looked like mine, but it didn’t feel like it. My bed was made, but the sheets smelled like they’d been recently used, not fresh. My clothes—ones I hadn’t worn in months—were missing from their usual spots in my closet. The drawers looked rummaged through, and some of my favorite outfits were lying in the laundry basket like they’d just been worn.

Even my makeup bag had been disturbed. The products I rarely use were out of place, and my foundation bottle was nearly empty, even though I distinctly remember it being almost full the last time I used it. It felt like someone had been living in my room—using my things—but everything was just familiar enough to make me question my sanity.

I checked my phone again, this time scrolling through my camera roll. I don’t usually take many pictures or videos, so the sheer number of them was shocking. Hundreds. Maybe thousands. Photos of me, drunk selfies with friends, videos of me with my family and baby siblings, random stuff from college classes.

Except… it wasn’t me.

The girl in the photos looked similar to me—same hair color, same eye color—but there was something wrong with her. She smiled in most of the pictures, but the smile didn’t feel real. Her eyes were too sharp, almost predatory. In some of the photos, she leaned in too close to my friends, her grin stretched wide like she was in on a joke no one else knew.

The videos were worse. In one, she looked directly at the camera for several seconds before laughing and turning away, as though she’d noticed someone—or something—just out of frame. Her voice was lighter, almost playful, but it had an edge to it, like she was mocking whoever was recording.

I started freaking out, like, full-blown panic attack. I ran to my flatmate’s room and begged them to help me. I explained everything, showed them the photos and videos of this random girl on my phone. But they just looked at me like I was losing it. They said the girl in the photos was me. That I’ve been here, living with them, acting completely normal for the past nine months.

I couldn’t believe them. I still don’t. I called my mom, thinking maybe she’d back me up—she’d know, right? But no. Same thing. She said it’s been me all along. That I’ve been coming over, talking to her, playing with my siblings. She didn’t even sound worried. She thought I was just tired or stressed.

But how can my own mom not recognize that this isn’t me? How can my flatmate, my friends, my professors—everyone—be convinced this random girl is me? Where did she come from? Where did I go for nine months?

And here’s the worst part: I don’t know where she is now. She’s gone. Disappeared, just like that. Is she watching me? Am I going to wake up tomorrow and have actually lost years to this random girl?

I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know if I’m safe in my own skin anymore.

If anyone has any ideas—or if you’ve heard of anything like this—please, I need help.

I want to gage an interest level and get inspiration to see if this is something I want to do.

The plan I have so far is for a hamburger joint. A place that'll be open past midnight, maybe closing at like 3 or 4 am and opening at noon. I've been tossing around the 24 hour idea. I want it to have a classic feel but also something that would attract young people. 

My menu would probably change throughout the day. So at about 12-9, there would be a main plate as the special, something simple like country fried steak, grilled chicken, some kind of homestyle but quick food. Then open to close, and the main draw, would be hamburgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, fries, onion rings, tenders, milkshakes, soda, coffee, simple, quick food.

The smell of bacon and coffee woke me from my slumber. Stepping out of my carriage, I went to take care of my morning constitutional. Pamba ran into the bushes off to my right but Todd stayed close and took care of his business next to me. I thought that a bit odd but shrugged it off.

Tiana, Lukas, and Gus were waiting on me beside the enclosure where they washed me up and scented me. Yawning, I heard the girls on the other side of the screen discussing what they would do first after I officially presented them to Elder Imin in Ardu. Rana brought me my Red and Blue outfit as we would be in Tirion within a few spans. Now fully dressed,  decided to eat with the girls this morning which seemed to cheer them up and gather some information about these lands.

With the girls seated around the small fire pit, my cook Jason and his helper Ken brought scrambled eggs mixed with fried potatoes with onions and a sauce that I recognized as Wasabi. Three thick slices of salted and a sweet brine soaked bacon that was fried to a good crispness. The last item had me puzzled. It was some sort of a smooth red berry that apparently had a large seed in the middle that had been sliced in half and sauteed with butter and herbs. It was a fruit I had not seen before. Ken then brought a metal pot that had a distinct coffee aroma with a hint of mocha. When Ken poured the yellowish brown tea like drink into my cup, I was both excited and very confused. Taking a sip, I was stunned. It was a citrusy sweet with a slight smokey nutty flavor with a hint of mocha coffee. Again, I was stunned.  

“Ken, what is this drink?” I asked as Ken was finishing pouring other cups of the knights. 

“It is Fruit Seed Quahwa Tea,” Ken replied almost matter of factually which made me feel subconscious about my lack of knowledge of common things that a Sionian should know.

“I see. Thanks, it just reminded me of a drink called coffee where I come from.” I said and took another drink. 

It was disconcerting how close it tasted to actual coffee yet it looked nothing like coffee. I sighed and just accepted this small pleasure.  As I ate, I listened to the small talk from the girls which was all about what what I would ask Elder Imin for my reward. Finally, Orlandra spoke up. 

“Lord Wyatt, what will you ask Elder Imin for your reward?” Asked Orlandra with several others nodding or giving an affirmative “Yes, tell us” comment. 

“I will not ask Elder Imin. It is not my place to ask. Rather Elder Imin will present a reward if he chooses. It is a matter of honor for my House to get you all home safe. Many leaders reward those who do what I have done. It is up to each leader how they show their gratitude. I may only get a verbal thank you. Anything I am given is up to each leader often with discussion and consultation with their nobility. Since Alphardia has no noble class, then it is up to the Council of Elders. It matters not to me one way or the other. The reputation and honor of my House are on display which will be noticed by King Leon and King Magnus. Both place a high regard on honor and deeds. Anything beyond that is extra,” I replied with a shrug of my shoulders in an almost dismissive tone.

“You mean you may not get anything other than a thank you for all that you have done? You fought to free us and fought to keep us safe. I saw your wounds and they looked painful. Are you sure you do not want something?” Asked Lurye a dark brown haired brown eyed Elf who rarely spoke to anyone other than her fellow Wards.

“That is correct. For me, it is about personal honor, the reputation of the House of Wyatt, and how other nobles of Astria view what I have done. Surely, you have heard tales of other nobles who have returned captives back to their homes? Tell me what you have heard?” I asked Lurye with a raised eyebrow as I fed Pamba who was suddenly sitting on my shoulder.

“I... I am not sure. When I was a small child, heard about a Dwarf Paladin riding a Dain Boar who returned a Hyborean who escaped from slavers. The story was he demanded gold and to be proclaimed a hero until the turning of the season,” Lurye replied with furrowed eyebrows as she sat in a thinking pose.

“Interesting. What did his fellow Dwarves have to say to that?” I asked as my mind raced that Dwarves actually rode boars here on Sionia.

“I believe his Grand Thane praised him but said he should have asked for more gold,” Lurye answered as she looked back at me.

“I see. The last thing I want is to be seen as a greedy no good ne'er-do-well. I will rely on Elder Imin's honor not to embarrass or tarnish Alphardia in his dealings with me,” I responded to Lurie shrugging my shoulders again.

Lurye and the rest of my Wards just looked at one another in silence as they considered what I had told them. With the mood gone, I excused myself as I prepared for the final six hours to reach the City of Tirion. 

I was surprised by my own answer. It was like a gut feeling I had about Elder Imin. Looking over at Pamba, she was looking at me and I clearly understood the words, “Trust me.  Better this way”.

“Lord Wyatt. I see that you learned Atlantean words. Kaffe and sometimes Coffee is their word for Quahwa.” Accused Quarrin with a hard look of surprise.

“Forgive my lapses in common knowledge. I did not grow up like most others. So, experiencing things and knowing proper names has been a struggle. Seems words I thought were the correct often are not right. It has been a frustrating exercise in how short my education is. However, I also find that I have knowledge in topics of personal interest that others lack. My education was heavy in reading, writing, mathematics, and basic sciences paired with the physical development of the body. I was always encouraged to read books. Many times I got to choose which books and topics I was allowed to read. I was then made to write an accurate report of what I read as verification that I actually read the book and not just look like I was reading.” I said in what I hoped was an excuse in why I was both very knowledgeable and also vastly ignorant. 

“Interesting. I never considered that teaching method. I wish I had met you eight hundred years ago. I can only imagine what academic excellence and breakthroughs could have been achieved with that teaching method. So, I take it you had an Atlantean tutor?” Quarrin speculated with this question and a probing glare as he studied me closely.

“I do not know where my teachers were from. They were just teachers whose tenure was very brief and sadly,  I do not even remember several of their names.  I had so many. Some for just a few months others for just a cycle. Each one had their own focus. Basically, some only teach small children the very basics.  As I grew older, teachers became more specific subject focused.” I answered Quarrin with a shrug of my shoulders and a dismissive tone.

“Interesting. So, your father never hired a full time tutor is that right?” Asked Quarrin as he looked thoughtful at my disclosure.

“Yes, that is correct. My father never hired a full time tutor for me. I just attended lessons when it was time to learn.” I replied carefully in my selection of words.

“Ah, I understand. Now, it makes sense why you seem so contradictory in your knowledge. Because you never had a proper long term tutor, there are large gaps in what normally would be taught to a noble's children. I have seen this a few times with, well, less wealthy nobles.” Quarrin said with a nervous little laugh.

“You are not wrong. My father was not a rich man but he was not poor either. He provided a comfortable living for our family but there was never any extra coin for luxuries.” I replied again carefully selecting my words.

“I understand. I was very confused with you until now. It all makes sense to me.” Quarrin said with an approving nod that what he speculated about me was true.

I just nodded and stepped away and with the excuse to see to my constitutional which I knew would end my conversation with Quarrin. I also realized that Quarrin gave me the perfect excuse to use moving forward to explain away my lack of common knowledge of Sionia while also having advanced knowledge that was above Sionia's level and was actually believable and not bizarre. 

The travel to Tirion went without incident and we reached the wooden walled city late in the afternoon. When we were approaching the city, the wooden gates were suddenly closed. Quarrin went to the gatekeeper when we arrived at the gate where we were immediately allowed to enter. As we passed through the gates into the city, we were given stares of apprehension to overt dislike. I noticed that many of the Aphardians were pointing at my carriage. It then dawned on me that they were pointing at Razor and Beowulf who were sitting on the carriage's tiger perch.

Quarrin could not suppress his excitement and walked briskly into a shop on the corner of the first square just past the city gates. A short time later, Quarrin returned with a young looking Elf.

“Count Wyatt, this is my great great great grandson Ulfric. He manages this store that sells Grandeur Berry Wine,”Quarrin introduced Ulfric showing his pride.

“It is a pleasure to meet you, Ulfric,” I responded to Quarrin's introduction.

“Yes. You should hurry along so you can reach a good camping site. As a human, you can not stay here.” Said Ulfric with clear hostility behind his words. 

“Ulfric, Count Wyatt has done me a boon and brought me home in relative comfort. Why are you being so rude to my guest?” Quarrin asked Ulfric in shock and surprise.

“Humans are helping the Thranduil faction to raise a king over all of Alphardia. The civil war that you once spoke of has once again returned over the divide of how we govern ourselves. Humans are now despised and hated for having spilled Alphardian blood for Amroth. You of all should know Amroth seeks to regain their old position and claim the right to be called a High Elf and King over all Sindarians which make up over ninety-five percent of Alphardian people today. War is upon us and humans are the instigators who poisoned  Amroth with guile to stoke that long lost desire.” Explained Ulfric as he openly displayed his dislike. 

Looking around, I saw more and more Elves gather each having the same outward and open disdain for our party. I decided it best to leave as that would be best to say nothing as I wanted no part in any internal conflict that had nothing to do with me.

“So, all those here are fighting over the fact that they are descended from Sindar who rose in rank from a commoner to become a noble. Does anyone realize that we have the power to split our people into noble and commoner now? No, they seek the perceived status of the Hyborean nobility. Sindar gained his noble status through deeds and marrying a princess. My great great great grandchild, this civil war is foolishness born of pride and false inferiority feelings that go against what we Sindarians are and could be in the future. We are the people who make everything work and run in every Elf society. Even the Hyboreans require our people to maintain their way of life. Without us, they are nothing!” Quarrin explained to Ulfric and all those who had gathered to listen.

Ulfric said nothing and there was a low murmur as a few Alphardians were quietly talking here and there. Seeing the resolve come over Ulfric's and several other's faces, I realized nothing Quarrin said would matter.

“Quarrin, it is for the best that I leave. Besides, I am actually in a hurry anyway. I must finish my task for I have long travel days ahead. The Empire is constantly invading and I must get home to protect my people and wife. I am glad to have met you and you are most welcome should you come to Astria,” I said with a short bow of my head.

“I am sorry and ashamed for the disrespect these here have shown you. You have been nothing but honorable. I have heard your people speak highly of you and their display of loyalty and devotion would be the envy of any leader. That is something really rare. I will miss our talks. Farewell friend.” Quarrin said with a full bow which seemed to shock the Alphardians watching our exchange.

“Farewell and I hope nothing but happiness follows you,” I replied and motioned for my people to leave the City of Tiron. 

After we had left the city, I called for Sir Jas to discuss what had just happened and make certain we were on guard should someone wish to drag us into a meaningless war which I wanted no part of.  It was decided that we would travel on and through the night as the road was well maintained. Sir Jas had suggested this move as he like me was concerned about a potential ambush given the hostility shown in Tirion. We pressed on for another hour before stopping for Big Jake and the cooks to make our meals. I wanted two premade meals that could be quickly heated. One would be the evening meal and a second meal for during the night that could be eaten on the road as people would need energy for the grueling long push. 

We traveled at a slightly faster pace than the slow walk of the florses. This pace allowed us to reach the main highway to Ardu by the evening of the following day.  We camped next to a merchant relay station which was near the crossroads at the  Tirion  Ardu main highway. We fell into a routine of traveling with single minded purpose stopping only for meals and for nighttime. We had been traveling hard for seven days since leaving the City of Gondolin and were grateful for the uneventful time on the road.  On the morning of the eighth day, Sir Cleef made the announcement. 

“Ardu ahead,” Shouted Sir Cleef as he crested a small rise that overlooked the flood plains down to the Silver River where the City of Ardu was on the west bank.

Looking out the open window of my carriage, I viewed the City of Ardu. What struck me most was its odd appearance.  Unlike the white stone houses of Triron with blue, black, and golden towers that would make you think you were in  Russia back on Earth,  Ardu looked like a kid's playground with a very high city wall made of long pole logs. The city itself had tree houses connected by suspension bridges. The buildings at the base of trees were designed to encircle each massive tree.  My view was obstructed as we descended into the flood plain and into a beautiful well maintained forest. As we traveled the last couple of miles to Ardu, we passed meadows full of garden plots growing all manner of herbs, vegetables, fruits, and flowers of all colors and shapes. 

Finally, we came to an area about one hundred yards from the city walls that was devoid of nearly all trees. The few trees that were in this area were fruit trees that were no more than twelve to twenty feet tall.  There were also garden plots evenly spaced that sat in between the city walls and the forest. These plots were well kept and each had a living vine type low two foot high fence that upon close inspection was full of squash and gourds. 

When we reached the city's main gate to the west, there were several Elven Guards and a few mounted soldiers. They all had a look of apprehension but they also seemed to be expecting us.  Sir Cleef met with an Elf Mounted Soldier who nodded and began leading our caravan into the city. Passing through the city gates of Ardu, I saw nothing but wooden buildings. The largest trees had wooden staircases that wind around the tree up to the tree houses above. Suspension bridges connected each tree to the next with the larger trees serving as central hubs for the smaller trees around them. 

We continued toward the largest and most massive tree that appeared to be literally in the middle of the City of Ardu. When we arrived at this massive tree, it looked like no other in the city. It had very elaborately carved wood buildings that surrounded it. However, the tree appeared to have a hollow section where huge double doors that led into the tree itself that also had windows for light. It was an impressive sight and one that left me awestruck in its complexity and how such a thing could be done without killing the tree itself.

I exited my carriage as everyone began gathering in the circular courtyard that was before the massive entrance to the tree. Sir Cleef and the Mounted Elf now dismounted approached each with a serious look on their faces.

“Lord Wyatt, this is General Lanear Evereska Yuirwood,” Sir Cleef introduced the tall well muscled black haired Elf in very ornate leather armor.

“It is an honor, General Lanear Evereska Yuirwood. I am Count Ryan Wyatt,” I introduced myself as Sir Cleef had not formally introduced me as he should have.

“The High Elves arrived this morning with armed transports which put our people on edge. They informed our Council of their mission to escort you to Borealis. The Council requests your presence as we were informed of your escort of Alphardians who were held captive by slavers.” Announced General Lanear followed by a formal bow.

“Yes, I accept the invitation to meet with Elder Imin and the rest of the Council,” I replied with a quarter bow in return.

“Very good. If you will follow me then,” Commanded General Lanear who quickly turned and began to walk away.

“One moment, General Lanear,” I called out to the tall Elf who stopped and looked over his left shoulder with a puzzled expression. 

“Is there a problem?” Asked General Lanear with a heavy frown. 

“Yes! Please wait for the ladies. They are the most important persons that brought me to Ardu. I will properly finish my duty to them with full honor and respect and it will not do that they must walk the final short distance alone.” I answered General Lanear with a heavy look of disapproval. 

General Lanear just stood looking at me for a good thirty seconds before he nodded before facing me and crossed his arms as if my request was an annoyance. 

“I understand your position, General Lanear. We have already been confronted by the citizens of Tirion who informed me of the current situation and rebellion that is causing perhaps a civil war?” I disclosed what I already knew was happening in the Kingdom of Alphardia.

“Do you really understand?” Asked General Lanear looking at me with a smirk of disregard. 

“I believe so. Your council formed in place of a king who once ruled over your people. The name of your country is the Kingdom of Alphardia. That name suggests that you have a King as your leader yet a Council now rules. Your current crisis is one that has been ongoing for a very long time and just now is boiling over with those who want to install a King. My understanding is one faction has either allied with or hired humans to help toward that goal most likely using force or threats. As for politics, it is just power plays of individuals and factions trying to ensure that they are on top of society when all is said and done. All of which really has nothing to do with me. I am only here out of honor and respect to my wards and nothing more.” I replied with a shrug of my shoulders and shaking my head.

General Lanear's eyes narrowed and his mouth pursed a bit and finally said, “You do understand a little of what is happening. It is good and you should leave immediately as it would be best for everyone,” advised General Lanear as he nodded acceptance to my reply.

Just ten minutes later and a very short walk across the circular courtyard to the massive tree that obviously served as their capital building. The guards opened the massive iron reinforced double doors that led inside the massive tree that I guessed was a good fifty to sixty feet in diameter and well over four hundred feet tall. Passing into the tree was an amazing sight. The chamber was actually under the tree where the roots created a dome of sorts over the chamber. I saw that some roots had been coaxed into their shape by iron brackets that were restraining newer root offshoots ensuring they would grow into the dome shape with the rest of the root system. The floor was simple flat stones laid over dirt as the stones did not butt up against the roots. There was a keyhole shaped table in the the middle of the chamber. The round section of the table was opposite the main chamber doors with the trapezoidal-shaped side extended toward the main chamber doors. There were three rows of seats that encircled the main table in the center of the room except the area of the main doors.

Looking to my right, I saw a familiar face. It was Captain Wynthar and several other Hyborean elves seated off to my right. I nodded to Captain Wynthar and walked to the end of the table where I motioned for my Alphardian wards to stand off to my left. 

“I am Count Ryan Wyatt of Astria. I have traveled far to meet with you Elder Imin and this council. After battling what I thought was thieves, I found I had rescued many women from slavers. I have brought your people back to their homeland and now officially fulfilled my duty as their guardian. Do you accept them?” I asked after my introduction and outline of what I was there for.

“Count Wyatt. We welcome you to Ardu. Your exploits and deeds have reached us and we have awaited  your arrival. We the Council of Elders gladly accept the return of our people.” Said Elder Imin who stood on shaky legs. 

“It warms my heart to reunite those who have been torn from people.” I replied with a short head bow.

Silence fell over the room as none of the elders said anything and we just stared at each other. Finally, Elder Imin spoke up.

“I expect you want a reward. Know that we are a poor country. So, what reward are you seeking?” Asked Elder Imin in a pathetic voice.

There were gasps and grumbling noises from the Hyboreans which caused the Council of Elders to shift uncomfortably in their seats and many cast a downward gaze as they could not look me in the eye.

“I see.  You have applied guilt and sympathy in place of a proper reward. Very well, I will make this easy for you.  I wish for trade to be established with Aphardia. It is my request as a reward that you send a steady supply of herbs over the next two cycles. After two cycles, we can come to a reasonable trade exchange rate that will continue  our established trade far into the future. There are many herbs that are rarely seen outside of the Elf Lands. These I wish to have. Additionally, I have two companions who are ventu volpis. I would like you to send fruits and herbs that they normally would eat. A treat for them as they will be living in the far south of this continent.” I proposed and stood up into my well rehearsed merchant stance. 

“You are paired with two ventu volpis'? A mated pair at that?” Questioned the youngest looking Elder of the Council rudely who was seated closest to me and to my right.

“Yes, they are a mated pair. And you are whom exactly?” I questioned the rude Elder after I had answered his outburst.

“I am Elder Arun Oriphyra Grey Havens,” Replied  Elder Arun with a look of contempt. 

“Anyway, I do not need money if that is your concern. You have herbs in abundance and I am in need of them. Also, should Alphardia have any other resources that are unique to your lands, send me a sample over the next two years. If it is something I can use for the good of my people, then we can settle on future trade exchange rates for those items as well. I would like this arrangement to be a two-way deal. Although I do not have any trade ships at this time, I will eventually acquire a few within the next two years. If there is anything in our resources that you would like to have, we can work out a full trade list of exchange goods. I believe this is exceedingly reasonable and way less costly than what normally would be granted to a guardian of so many young ladies.” I continued with my request pushing the no money exchange angle which in the end would be way more beneficial to me.

The Elders stood and began to gather around Elder Imin where they huddled and discussed my proposal in a low murmur. After about ten minutes of discussion, the Elders once again took their seats.

“We the Council of Elders of Alphardia accept your request for compensation. We will send a trade ship down the Alph River to Camelot or to any city in your domain that you designate,” Announced Elder Imin with a short bow.

“That is acceptable. Ladies, it has been a pleasure to know you. Please have a happy and fruitful life,” I said with a formal bow then doing the same for the girls.

All the girls returned my bow with a couple of girls beginning to cry as they were finally free to go home and unite with their relatives. Elder Imin, waved me away and leaned over to talk quietly with the Elder to his left.

“Count Wyatt, it is good to see you again,” Captain Wynthar said with a short bow and a broad smile as he walked up to me.

“Yes, I am glad to see a friendly face here in the Elf Lands,” I replied dryly but with a smile. 

“Understandable. Come, let us get you and your people to Borealis. If we leave immediately, we can get you there by tomorrow evening,” Captain Wynthar said enthusiastically.

“Sounds good. Let's be off, for I have far to go and not much time to get there,” I said with a little laugh.

I walked with Captain Wynthar out of the massive tree and to my carriage. Captain Wynthar joined me in my carriage and the other Hyboreans were invited to ride in my second carriage. It was a short ten minute ride to the docks where the armed ships were not river transports but ocean going armed merchantmen. This was a surprise but understandable for which I was grateful given the area to the east of Riverdale was technically an active war zone. 

While the carriages and carts were being loaded, I heard my name called by General Lanear. Turning I saw him and about a dozen soldiers with him jogging toward me.

“This does not look good,” I said to Captain Wynthar who came and stood next to me.

“No, it is not. Something is amiss,” Replied Captain Wynthar as he seemed to brace himself for a fight.

“Count Wyatt, Elder Imin ordered this given this to you. You left so suddenly that it took him by surprise,” General Lanear said in an accusatory manner. 

“Really? Elder Imin waved me way dismissively after I said my goodbyes,” I replied crossing my arms and giving General Lanear a hard stare. 

“The woman cursed the Elders for their disrespect of you and made demands that the Council was forced to accept. The Council was forced to write out the full contract with you including their agreement with the women. The women had the gall to have the entire Council sign it. The women demanded this scroll be given to you.” General Lanear explained as he handed me the rolled up scroll but could not look me in the eye. 

Taking the scroll, I began to read what it contained. It pretty much had two sections. The first section was my reward. The first item listed was for open trade for herbs free of charge for two years. After two years,  a meeting to negotiate trade costs was be established. The second item on the list was expanded trade for any additional trade goods or resources of Alphardia approved for trade by Count Ryan Wyatt to be negotiated for each new item within seven months at the proper trade exchange rates. The third item listed was the acceptance of each new trade good from Count Ryan Wyatt of Astria and approved for trade by the Kingdom of Alphardia to be negotiated for each new item within seven months with the proper trade exchange rates. The three listed items were exactly what I had requested.  The next section was a list of my Wards bearing each girl's name and their demands for compensation from the Council.  At the bottom was the most interesting clause. It read: “Count  Ryan Wyatt as guardian protector the above listed will uphold the agreement with the Council of the Kingdom of Alphardia and bear witness should the Council fail to keep its promises and word.”

 I was taken aback for a moment but realized that the girls were very smart and realized that there could be a change in government in the future. If a King should arise, then I would have to hold that King to the agreements made this day. It was impressive yet made my head hurt. The political fallout and problems that could happen in the future were too numerous to contemplate.

“I have received the document and acknowledge it for what it is. Thank you, General Lanear. Perhaps in the future when things are less volatile, we can have a fruitful conversation.” I spoke as eloquently as I could and nodded to General Lanear. 

“Yes. Just so you know, there are factions fighting between here and the narrows.” General Lanear said and simply turned and walked away not bothering to hear any reply from me.

“That was rude of him. Then again, many Elves do not have a positive opinion of humans. I can assure you  no one will have such disrespect shown to you in our lands.” Captain Wynthar said with a forced smile hoping to uplift the somber mood.

“It is alright. I actually understand why they are acting this way. Seems human mercenaries are being used to force a political change. That means a minority group feels oppressed and has decided to use violence to change the status quo. Unfortunate. However, it is none of my affair.” I said with a shrug of my shoulders.

“I was not aware human mercenaries were hired. We just assumed it was another political disagreement which happens regularly.” Captain Wynthar said and I could see his mind at work at the possibilities of expanded conflict.

“Word of caution. I suspect the Empire is behind all these problems seen in all the nations at the same time. Too much coincidence given how things have unfolded. I was warned by several who would know that the Empire is instigating conflict if not outright civil war in many nations. If nations are fighting themselves, the Empire can take what they want and not face an allied front. Just beware of intrigue that has fully blossomed pretty much everywhere.” I said with a nod.

“Yes, I understand. I will discuss this with the King to ensure our own lands do not get caught in the intrigue you speak of. Now, come. I have a treat and a meal awaiting you.” Captain Wynthar said with a smile and a hearty laugh.  

Captain Wynthar true to his word had already acquired enough food for everyone for the midday meal. I was impressed as it contained what looked like spit-roasted chicken with lots of vegetables, herbs, and an assortment of fruits and nuts. The last was something I had not seen in almost a half year since coming to Sionia, Elvin Bread coated in honey.  It was indeed a treat.

After eating on the docks, my people began boarding the merchantmen armed trading vessels where there were a good three dozen rowers and pole pushers moving the four vessels upriver. Our progress was slow but steady. By early evening, we reached what Captain Wythnar called the narrows of the Silver River and the border between the  Kingdom of Hyborea and the  Kingdom of Alphardia.  It was a place the river narrowed and had a bit of rapids on the eastern side but the main channel was more to the western side.  The narrows also marked a change in topography where rolling hills began with long northeast to southwest running valleys. The winds coming down from the Grey Mountains picked up and were fairly steady. The Elven crew stowed their oars and unfurled the sails which billowed nicely in the breeze. The progress we were making up the river was significantly faster and I estimated we were doing a good ten knots if not more.  

I  was given my own cabin as the carts and carriages were stowed below deck. The room was decent with a bed that was wide enough for two but in reality, only one person could sleep comfortably. Laying down, I decided to just rest as there was nothing to do. It was getting dark and it would be early morning before we even reached the City of Riverdale. Looking over at Pamba and Todd, they were already fast asleep. I shifted Pamba where she once again curled in the crook of my arm with Todd laying half across my belly. I smiled as I felt nothing but a cozy feeling of family as I closed my eyes.",3,1736068432.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

What I want to essentially do is - create an excel sheet with those very basic inputs, but my problem is the input into the sheet. I know I can open it on my phone and input stuff, but is there a way to create a table - but then have an excel based widget that has the Type (Drop down) & Dosage (Open field)  + Submit button - and it captures in an excel sheet in the backend with a timestamp? 

Is that something that's possible or am I looking into something too complicated for something too minor? I know i can use some of the calorie tracking apps but I haven't found any that I can export the data to excel and then visualize it at the end of the year!

Taste and experience:
I experimented a bit with this coffee and I liked it best with the specified method in the v60 one Cup. When I made 2 cups, it somehow became too watery and no longer intense enough.
It's really delicious as a single cup! You can taste tropical fruit as the basic note, which is broken up by a tangy lime - but nicely and integrated into the sweetness, so that it remains exciting. You can also taste the lime, although I find it difficult to separate its tanginess from the lime. The only drawback I would say is that I missed that certain something in the special preparation and the ""typical"" Ethiopian aroma, at least a little.

Now early in to 2025, the crypto market is on the verge of the greatest alt season ever seen.

More specifically, a “memecoin supercycle” as labelled by much of CT.

It happened in 2017 and 2021. The alt seasons gave rise to events such as Shib exploding in 2021, where it saw a rise from 22m to 22B in only 36 days around April that year.

Standing now on the precipice of crypto greatness once again, there lay ahead of us an opportunity for many established communities to take this cycle all the way to the top, just like Shib.

The foundation laid in 2024 and early 2025 is what will determine success during the imminent alt season. Communities with conviction and belief, ones that inspire, provide a sense of belonging and give motivation to those who participate.

**Why Kendu is in pole position to win this cycle**

Launched in Feb of 2024, Kendu has now seen 10+ months of proof of life and establishment.

With constant growth, engagement and awareness spreading of the Kendu name, it has been our mission to ensure we are in pole position to capture the decabillions this cycle.

We have grown day in and day out, 10 months after launch, which means that we are here to stay and there is genuinely only one way now for us to go - up. 2024 was a year comprised of foundation building and community development, experiencing the necessary periods of redistribution and growth that are essential for any organic memecoin to hit the billions.

\*The community is so large and so decentralized that it is hard to capture all the alpha in one post, so i strongly recommend you read through the x article link located at the bottom of this post.\*

**2024 Achievements**

In the early days of Kendu we saw Shytoshi, the Shib dev, messaging within our TG and offering words of encouragement. He follows our doxxed dev, Miazaki, and the main Kendu page as well. In fact, he is so linked to our dev he even placed us on Shib mag.

[Shib Mag](https://preview.redd.it/dvbx0l9145be1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=a098b1a8c831d76a078068ec5bc22053f480eda3)

Kendu is not a community to remain in the shadow of another, though. We aim to cast our own shadow and to take the number 1 spot.

Recognising that community is the ultimate driver of success for a memecoin, we have cultivated a perpetual culture of hard work and an unparalleled sense of unity under our motto: ""We do not gamble, we work.""

This dedication has propelled us to achieve an ATH of $280M mc in a pre-bull run market—an impressive feat rarely seen during that period last year.

Our success has been entirely organic, with no reliance on paid KOLs or paid marketing, as we understand it only leads to pump-and-dumps. This approach has fostered consistent and sustained growth in our social presence and holders.

Even during the huge market dips, shakeouts and massive Eth drops of the last 10 months, our holders have never seen a decrease.

[Holders never dipping](https://preview.redd.it/bpqp2kv245be1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=725413a1799aad6a6e1813c708812c5504af31d9)

We have over doubled our holders now since ATH, and are holding a concrete floor of 30M that is consolidating nicely. This redistribution period is not unusual either, with most other memecoins in the billions experiencing periods eerily similar before their legs up. This has also led now to the top 100 holders owning 51.37% (at time of writing) of supply - incredibly healthy and bullish for any memecoin, especially one at this level.

To then demonstrate our social media presence, taken directly from grok:

""Moreover, posts on social media highlight $KENDU's community as being miles ahead in terms of engagement and activity, positioning it as a leader in community-driven momentum for the upcoming year. This is further supported by specific figures showing a rise in engagements and mentions, with a reported increase of 48.07 million engagements and 412.85 thousand mentions.""

412.85 thousand mentions of the Kendu name. We dominate every single poll, we win all the raids we participate in and we consistently get engagement that is unseen.

[Community](https://preview.redd.it/10vjz9m445be1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8a2ed73c93856883b445611a26721b93d274f3f)

We know social media isnt the only way to get the name out there though. IRL is the Kendu way. We have countless community members daily, handing out flyers, placing stickers, shilling to friends and their networks and utilising their skills to ensure the world knows Kendu.

we now even have under our belt genuine products such as our energy drinks and coffee.

[Energy and Coffee](https://preview.redd.it/k0m08z6745be1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dc4a5cf92a826ae82c33aa43243f052f23b30ad)

Thats in addition to our gum, hot sauce, jewellery and merchandise - with so much more in the pipeline.

Our community in general has established a convicted and driven approach to the Kendu name, with many of our community members essentially living and breathing it.

so much conviction in fact, that we have 12 community tattoos.

[Tattoos](https://preview.redd.it/fg17rqr845be1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=360f924ef74b71a2fe3daf509690a3f15bf91cd2)

We instil in every new holder our ethos and methods and so often they come back with statements along the lines of ""I have never ever seen a community like this""

You go in to any TG - no one is as active as us.

Of course with a community like this, it then leads to success elsewhere.

* We had the largest NFT mint of the last 2 years
* Our dev has given away of 200K + USD to community members for challenges and also out of the kindness of his heart for dedicated community members

We have also just completed our Certik audit - the second memecoin EVER to complete the 50 000 votes organically, only behind Pepe. With this audit - it proves we are unruggable and here to stay.

Not only that, we are also only 1 of 2 existing memecoins right now who have our own dedicated stocktwits page.

We then even get mentioned and noticed by several T1 CEXs such as Coinbase, OKX and Bitget.

[Coinbase](https://preview.redd.it/es11ezkb45be1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=12ec19b7805173622ae489095df5fc919374104e)

Only a couple days ago Coinbase for the second time posted us, this time now on their main page.

2024 was a year to be remembered for Kendu. This is only a scratch on the surface though for our achievements so far.

The Kendu community is simply unmatched. No one does IRL, branding, engagement or conviction like us.

We are placing ourselves in absolute perfect position for this alt season and it is evidenced why. It would be unwise to not dip the toes in even slightly, for us succeeding this year is inevitable.

We are running it up just like Shib did. The Kendu name is beginning to be known globally and it is only a matter of time until the marketcap catches up to our actual value.

Join the Kendu movement, anon. We are an unstoppable force who will never stop.

It happened in 2017 and 2021. The alt seasons gave rise to events such as Shib exploding in 2021, where it saw a rise from 22m to 22B in only 36 days around April that year.

Standing now on the precipice of crypto greatness once again, there lay ahead of us an opportunity for many established communities to take this cycle all the way to the top, just like Shib.

The foundation laid in 2024 and early 2025 is what will determine success during the imminent alt season. Communities with conviction and belief, ones that inspire, provide a sense of belonging and give motivation to those who participate.

**Why Kendu is in pole position to win this cycle**

Launched in Feb of 2024, Kendu has now seen 10+ months of proof of life and establishment.

With constant growth, engagement and awareness spreading of the Kendu name, it has been our mission to ensure we are in pole position to capture the decabillions this cycle.

We have grown day in and day out, 10 months after launch, which means that we are here to stay and there is genuinely only one way now for us to go - up. 2024 was a year comprised of foundation building and community development, experiencing the necessary periods of redistribution and growth that are essential for any organic memecoin to hit the billions.

\*The community is so large and so decentralized that it is hard to capture all the alpha in one post, so i strongly recommend you read through the x article link located at the bottom of this post.\*

**2024 Achievements**

In the early days of Kendu we saw Shytoshi, the Shib dev, messaging within our TG and offering words of encouragement. He follows our doxxed dev, Miazaki, and the main Kendu page as well. In fact, he is so linked to our dev he even placed us on Shib mag.

[Shib Mag](https://preview.redd.it/1zpy4b4145be1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ed7f7c818deb1b129882234479301ba99c9682b)

Kendu is not a community to remain in the shadow of another, though. We aim to cast our own shadow and to take the number 1 spot.

Recognising that community is the ultimate driver of success for a memecoin, we have cultivated a perpetual culture of hard work and an unparalleled sense of unity under our motto: ""We do not gamble, we work.""

This dedication has propelled us to achieve an ATH of $280M mc in a pre-bull run market—an impressive feat rarely seen during that period last year.

Our success has been entirely organic, with no reliance on paid KOLs or paid marketing, as we understand it only leads to pump-and-dumps. This approach has fostered consistent and sustained growth in our social presence and holders.

Even during the huge market dips, shakeouts and massive Eth drops of the last 10 months, our holders have never seen a decrease.

[Holders increasing](https://preview.redd.it/utct4qp245be1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=78e94d1ae9c262c6de09f8cc04487c1a44978fef)

We have over doubled our holders now since ATH, and are holding a concrete floor of 30M that is consolidating nicely. This redistribution period is not unusual either, with most other memecoins in the billions experiencing periods eerily similar before their legs up. This has also led now to the top 100 holders owning 51.37% (at time of writing) of supply - incredibly healthy and bullish for any memecoin, especially one at this level.

To then demonstrate our social media presence, taken directly from grok:

""Moreover, posts on social media highlight $KENDU's community as being miles ahead in terms of engagement and activity, positioning it as a leader in community-driven momentum for the upcoming year. This is further supported by specific figures showing a rise in engagements and mentions, with a reported increase of 48.07 million engagements and 412.85 thousand mentions.""

412.85 thousand mentions of the Kendu name. We dominate every single poll, we win all the raids we participate in and we consistently get engagement that is unseen.

[Community](https://preview.redd.it/j1d5w8i445be1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=679c17abc4dccea6fe5c909570f14eea0aa95867)

We know social media isnt the only way to get the name out there though. IRL is the Kendu way. We have countless community members daily, handing out flyers, placing stickers, shilling to friends and their networks and utilising their skills to ensure the world knows Kendu.

we now even have under our belt genuine products such as our energy drinks and coffee.

[Energy drinks and Coffee](https://preview.redd.it/rur0cv2745be1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=892795a12e586c1e8a82cca92416e2a725365c64)

Thats in addition to our gum, hot sauce, jewellery and merchandise - with so much more in the pipeline.

Our community in general has established a convicted and driven approach to the Kendu name, with many of our community members essentially living and breathing it.

so much conviction in fact, that we have 12 community tattoos.

We instil in every new holder our ethos and methods and so often they come back with statements along the lines of ""I have never ever seen a community like this""

You go in to any TG - no one is as active as us.

Of course with a community like this, it then leads to success elsewhere.

We have also just completed our Certik audit - the second memecoin EVER to complete the 50 000 votes organically, only behind Pepe. With this audit - it proves we are unruggable and here to stay.

Not only that, we are also only 1 of 2 existing memecoins right now who have our own dedicated stocktwits page.

We then even get mentioned and noticed by several T1 CEXs such as Coinbase, OKX and Bitget.

Only a couple days ago Coinbase for the second time posted us, this time now on their main page.

2024 was a year to be remembered for Kendu. This is only a scratch on the surface though for our achievements so far.

Read these 6 articles for a detailed summary: [https://x.com/kojak797/status/1873184989518680313](https://x.com/kojak797/status/1873184989518680313?s=46&t=x-AVnqahJsjZkoYGfqo2qg)

The Kendu community is simply unmatched. No one does IRL, branding, engagement or conviction like us.

We are placing ourselves in absolute perfect position for this alt season and it is evidenced why. It would be unwise to not dip the toes in even slightly, for us succeeding this year is inevitable.

We are running it up just like Shib did. The Kendu name is beginning to be known globally and it is only a matter of time until the marketcap catches up to our actual value.

Join the Kendu movement, anon. We are an unstoppable force who will never stop.

The issue is, its hard to find them. For a couple years I've been considering making a little project that helps me find these hole-in-the-wall, niche, often independent coffee shops to really enjoy the coffee I drinl (I'm sick of always seeing starbucks etc).

If there was a mobile app that only showed cafes, with extensive filtering, AND it allowed you to rate your coffee, the type of coffee, experience etc would you use it?

I guess sort of a community of coffee lovers who try different cafes, always looking for the best new coffee and at the same time can see what other people have drank at said cafes and loved or disliked etc

Let me know, I think it would be an awesome place for all of us to co-exist.",3,1736067510.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False
1hu29py,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hu29py/inside/,Inside,"Fear, an emotion all humans possess, it is nature, it is innate, it is intrinsic, it drives humams towards survival, it saves us, it kills us. As a human, everyone has a fear that is their own, a farmer fears for his crops, a doctor fears for his patients, a mother... A mother fears for her children.

""Andy, don't go out too far, okay? Now go play"". I said as I turned away to go back to clean the house. Though I'm worried for Andy, I'm not too worried, she has always been an outdoorsy kid, she'd been like that ever since her late father introduced her to the world beyond our walls.

It was a very mundane day, I did the chores I needed to do, and worked. Thankfully, my job allows me to work from home, as a single mom of a 6 year old child, my superiors allowed me to do so. It was nearing 5:30 PM, and I was worrying for Andy, she always came home before 5 when the sun goes down, but maybe Andy's just having fun like all 6 year olds do. Before my worry became fear however, Andy came strutting down the porch, I could immediately recognize that it was her due to my daughter's unique gait, ""Mommy, mommy! Look what I found"". She said with a huge grin plastered on her face. It was a round object, no bigger than a tennis ball, it was hard, but it had a smooth texture, it was also warm to the touch. ""Honey, baby, where did you find this?"" I said inquisitively. ""I found it near the lake mommy!"". She said delightfully, clearly happy with whatever it is that she found ""Baby, didn't I tell you not to go too far? What if you got lost?"". I said with a stern voice, ""Teehee, I had so much fun mommy, I wanted to explore!"". She said happily. I'm fairly certain that I had a stern tone when I scolded her, but no worries, she's a kid, and what better way to learn the world is there than exploring it yourself, right? ""Alright, but just this time okay? Now go to the kitchen, I prepared your favorite"". Though lamenting on the fact that she was growing up, I'm happy that she's learning how to explore new things on her own.

The next day, I woke up late, and strangely, the rock my daughter handed me was nowhere to be seen, I put it on the nightstand near the bed before we slept but it wasn't there in the morning, I figured Andy Grabbed it before she fell asleep, rightbafter I did, so I paid it no mind. I woke Andy up, and told her to get ready, her school bus is going to arrive anytime soon now, so it's better if she gets ready now. As I sent Andy off to school, I felt somber, ""my beautiful daughter is growing up"". I say as I sipped on my morning coffee. I went back inside the house and into my makeshift office, a room me and my husband previously decorated as his gaming room. I sat down on his chair, though my husband has been dead for 4 years, his gaming chair is as comfortable as ever, I booted up the computer but it was taking so long, what could possibly have happened for this piece of garbage to start slowing down out of nowhere when it was working perfectly just yesterday. I was working, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that there is something, I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I was certain that there was something. ""Ugh, for christ's sake, what's with everything today!"" I said angrily. ""I'll just wait for Andy"". The thought of my daughter seemed to cheer me up. A few hours pass by with nothing of interest happening. I was feeling sick, my head infested with migraines and all the other kind of headache, it felt as if my head was being torn apart, being put back together and being torn apart again amd again, though I downed two pieces of tylenol, it didn't seem to help with the pain, not even one bit.

A few hours pass by again, and my daughter finally comes home, and when she did, I welcomed her with a surprise, I hid behind the door which opened towards the inside of the house, it was no problem doing this because she had her own spare key. ""Boo"" I shouted at her whilst jumping towards her, it did scare her, maybe it scared her a little bit too much, she was bawling her eyes out by the time I realized what I had done. ""I'm sorry baby, I didn't mean to scare you"" I said, but she didn't reply, she just kept on crying, thus, making me apologize even more profusely. Strangely, I feel great, the migraines suddenly disappeared after my little fiasco with Andy, ""What do you wanna eat Andy? I'll cook you my specialty, mommy's sorry okay?"" I said, but she didn't reply, she just looked at me, so I took that as a yes.

...

The migraines are back, I can't sleep, I'll grab something to drink, I thought to myself, going to the kitchen, I couldn't help but notice that the floor's awfully sticky, I'm fairly certain that I cleaned up after me and Andy ate together, she was acting weird but maybe she's just upset at me for scaring her earlier. The stickiness turned slimy, and I slipped and fell, my world turned black for a few moments, when I finally woke up, the stench of iron hit my nose, did a pipe leak or something? I finally arrived at the kitchen, I felt very groggy, and the migraine didn't help one bit. The whole kitchen was painted red, there was a red streak going from the kitchen to the bedroom. I turned on the lights, it was a grotesque scene, there were white shards all over the place, I only found out that it was bone after a little bit of thinking, my migraine was gone yet again, which I was thankful for, it made me think clearer, once again, the pungent smell of iron assaulting my nostrils since I woke up intensified. I looked over to the table, it was a mess. Blood still dripping from the table, the viscosity of it was very thick which made it look like solidified amber in the middle of dripping from the tree trunk, but in my case, it was thick blood dripping from the table, The grotesque scene of blood and bones made my brain go overdrive, I thought of all the things that could have made this mess, my thoughts were lightning fast, as if I drank a liter of energy drink. And only then did I think about Andy, Andy, where is my beautiful daughter, I turned around to go back to the bedroom, but my body suddenly didn't want to cooperate with me, nonetheless, I still walked.

I arrived at the bedroom and saw nothing, only the the white sheets that were stained red, where did my daughter go? I could have sworn I slept with her a few hours after we ate dinner, but it's weird, her dinner was still at the table, she didn't eat it. I felt my legs give out, the power residing in my muscles seemingly disappeared, before I fainted, my stomach bloated and it surged, something wanted to come out but I didn't care, I just wanted to see my daughter.

1hu27ck,https://i.redd.it/0p8nnj0z25be1.png,My Custom Character Concept - The Detective,"**The Detective** (no, not the scrapped one - I apologize) is a Gungeoneer focused on close-range combat and exploration, favoring hit-and-run tactics to draw enemies to his position (often behind tables) before ambushing them with the firepower he's collected.  
  
**INVENTORY**  
  
**Lawman's Lifeline** *(Sidearm)* - Six-shooter; slow reload time, decent accuracy.  
  
**Scalding Coffee** *(Active)* - Launches a wave of coffee in front of the Detective that stuns enemies before landing on the ground and catching fire.  
  
**Investigative Tack-tics** *(Passive)* - Slightly boosts movement speed/accuracy/luck based on map discovery %.  
  
**Straight Shooter** *(Synergy)* - Lawman's Lifeline + Badge/Cigarettes/Muscle Relaxant; increased accuracy + speedloader that greatly reduces reload time.  
  
**Blown Wide Open** *(Synergy)* - Investigative Tack-tics + Map (ALT: Gungeon Blueprints); the floor's boss is revealed via a poster in starting room (ALT: All floor bosses revealed via poster + all chests' loot pools are upgraded by one tier).  
  
**PAST**  
  
The Detective's past is set in a city not unlike New York. (The timeframe isn't set in stone - thinking either c. 1920 or modern day.) The Detective is armed with his **Lawman's Lifeline**, a **Thompson Sub-Machinegun**, and a unique **Badge** (**Partner's Badge** - *Line of Duty*) that cannot be dropped. The Detective approaches a police barricade, before a suspect (possibly similar in appearance (though completely unrelated) to the Convict) opens fire on a group of officers with a dual-wield **Cold .45** and **Machine Pistol** and flees into an alley. The police chief orders the Detective to stay behind and tend to the wounded officers, but their partner urges him to pursue the suspect.  
  
 At this point, the Detective is offered a choice.  
**<Tend to their wounds>** - The past continues its cycle, as the police are unable to secure the suspect, who later goes on to continue a streak of mob hits.  
**<Pursue the suspect>** - The Detective begins chasing the killer, and the boss fight begins.  
  
**BOSS**  
  
**ICE-MAN** - *Cold-Blooded Killer*  
  
*Author's Note: The killer bears a passing resemblance to Val Kilmer. The name is subject to change.*  
The fight begins with a short sequence of alleys that the Detective and his partner must run down - whilst occasionally dodging and returning gunfire to Ice-Man - following a path that is not blocked by fences and dumpsters, until they reach a set of two cars.  
Ice-Man will take the right car - an open-roof model - and speed off. The Detective and his partner must commandeer the second vehicle (a standard sedan or coupe), where his partner will drive as the Detective fires out the window. You must successfully shoot out the back tires while dodging barrels and various objects thrown out of the car by Ice-Man, as well as Cold .45 shots that will slow the car down and temporarily leave the wheels invulnerable (as they are out of range).  
After the first wheel is shot, Ice-Man's driving becomes more erratic - swerving back and forth, throwing projectiles with more force (causing them to bounce across the screen), and firing bursts of Cold .45 and Machine Pistol rounds.  
Once the car's wheels are shot out, Ice-Man will swerve off the road, rolling out of the driver's side as the car plunges into the nearby dock. The Detective and his partner will leave the second vehicle and approach the docks - at which point the final gunfight engages. Occasional obstacles include wooden shipping crates being dropped, Bullet Kin-esque criminal minions being spawned with Thompsons and Magnums, and the Cold .45 leaving trails of ice where it is shot.  
  
Once Ice-Man is defeated, he will have the guns blasted out of his hands and fall to his knees. When interacted with, he will beg for mercy - upon which the player can choose to shoot him or walk away. If the player turns away, however, he will pull a Derringer from his pocket, at which point the Detective's partner will put him down for good with a .38 Special. The cavalry (several police cars) arrive and arrest several additional criminals, upon which the Detective is congratulated and has his photo taken for a newspaper. As the camera flashes, the past ends and the credits sequence plays. Beating the past unlocks a black-and-white **Noir** skin for the Detective, while a second completion with his alternate skin unlocks the same color palette for his Lawman's Lifeline.

1hu27ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hu27ag/incomplete_bowel_movements_and_rectal_area/,Incomplete bowel movements and rectal area numbness (25F 170 cm 64 kg),"Hi guys, English is not my native language, so there might be some mistakes in what I write. I am 25 years old female, 170 cm 64 kg. Two years ago, I started experiencing diarrhea and excessive gas problems (this situation has been ongoing for two years, but a week ago, my doctor started antibiotic treatment suspecting SIBO, and now I no longer have diarrhea).

However, 19 months ago, despite having diarrhea, I began to feel like I couldn’t fully empty my bowels. I checked with my finger and noticed stool remaining in the rectum area. During this time, I had moved in with my boyfriend, and I couldn’t use the toilet when he was at home. Sometimes, I would hold my stool for days. I also struggled during sexual intercourse, feeling pain in my bowels (rectum area), and sex became unbearable for me.

Fifteen months ago, I moved into my own home, but the issue of incomplete evacuation didn’t improve; it even got worse. Additionally, a new problem started: stool would reach the rectum and stay there (not in the anus, but a part farther from the anus). To empty my bowels, I felt the need to drink coffee. In the last 15 months, I’ve only fully evacuated 3-4 times.

For the past 4-5 months, I’ve also been experiencing a loss of sensation in the rectum area. I only notice the presence of stool when I go to the toilet to urinate; otherwise, I don’t notice it throughout the day. I don’t feel the urge to defecate.

I’ve gone to the doctor multiple times, but they send me away without examining anything, saying it might be psychological. Also, when I had diarrhea and went to the toilet, the evacuation would happen very quickly, even though stool remained inside.

For the past 8-9 days, I haven’t had diarrhea thanks to the medication, and even though the stool is soft, I feel the need to strain for it to come out. Has anyone experienced this situation, and does it get better? Please give me some advice; I’m starting to struggle a lot mentally",1,1736067149.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I just want to ask if someone of you knows which company/artist is selling relatively big but beautiful tea cups (~250ml) with a handle and handcrafted art in Japanese style. If you know a producer matching the criteria but featuring Chinese or other fancy art you are free to include it in the comments! 🙂

The main problem I have with fine porcelain is that all those cups with a handle are relatively small, with a capacity of maybe 120-180ml or so. I don't know if this is because of the limitations of the material concerning structural integrity due to leverage but since regular coffee cups of this size are very common I think this problem can be circumvented.

... I am aware that this is kinda faked due to traditional asian tea cups not having a handle but I guess I am not the only person who likes bigger cups and handles for practicality.

1hu22po,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivatePackets/comments/1hu22po/how_proxies_protect_your_privacy_in_the_age_of_ai/,How Proxies Protect Your Privacy in the Age of AI Spying,"In 2025, AI is everywhere—monitoring, analyzing, and predicting your every online move. From targeted ads to advanced surveillance tools, artificial intelligence has made privacy feel like a thing of the past. But here’s the good news: **proxies** are one of the simplest and most effective ways to fight back. Let’s dive into how proxies can help safeguard your privacy in this AI-driven era.

# What’s AI Spying, and Why Should You Care?

AI spying isn’t just about cookies tracking what you buy online. It’s much bigger than that.

Here’s what AI can do with your data:

* **Behavior Prediction:** AI analyzes your clicks, searches, and time spent on pages to predict what you’ll do next.
* **Geo-Tracking:** Your IP address reveals your physical location, allowing companies or even hackers to pinpoint where you are.
* **Deep Profiling:** AI tools create detailed profiles of your preferences, income level, and habits to target ads—or worse, manipulate behavior.
* **Mass Surveillance:** Governments and corporations use AI for mass data collection, often without consent.

# How Proxies Help Protect Your Privacy

1. **Mask Your IP Address**
   * Your IP is like your online fingerprint. Proxies replace it with another IP, hiding your real location and identity.
   * AI systems can’t build accurate profiles if they can’t pinpoint your IP.
2. **Prevent Geo-Tracking**
   * Proxies let you choose an IP from another location.
   * Want to appear like you’re browsing from Paris while sipping coffee in New York? Easy.
3. **Disrupt AI Profiling**
   * AI thrives on consistent data. Using rotating proxies (e.g., from Bright Data or IPRoyal), you constantly change your IP. This confuses AI algorithms, making it harder for them to track and profile you.
4. **Secure Web Scraping**
   * While not privacy-related in the traditional sense, proxies enable safe web scraping without exposing your real IP to AI-driven anti-scraping tools.
5. **Avoid Censorship and Surveillance**
   * In countries with heavy internet censorship, proxies can bypass government filters.
   * Tools like mobile proxies make your activity appear as if it’s coming from a real smartphone, adding another layer of security.

# AI’s Favorite Tools vs. Proxy Protections

|**AI Spying Tool**|**What It Does**|**How Proxies Counter It**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Geo-IP Trackers**|Detects your location from your IP|Spoofs your location with a proxy|
|**Behavioral Profiling**|Tracks browsing patterns|Rotating IPs break consistent tracking|
|**Content Filters**|Blocks access to certain websites|Proxies bypass filters with ease|
|**Surveillance Algorithms**|Monitors your online communications|Encrypts and anonymizes your connections|

# Who Should Be Using Proxies?

* **Individuals Concerned About Privacy:**
   * Everyday users who want to browse anonymously or avoid being tracked.
* **Businesses Handling Sensitive Data:**
   * Companies can protect client data and prevent corporate espionage by using proxies.
* **Activists and Journalists:**
   * Proxies help circumvent censorship in restrictive regions, keeping sources and activities secure.
* **Developers and Researchers:**
   * Need to scrape data or test software without risking exposure? Proxies keep your work safe and private.

# Tips for Maximum Privacy with Proxies

* **Combine Proxies with VPNs:** For even stronger encryption, pair a proxy with a VPN.
* **Opt for Rotating Residential Proxies:** These are harder to detect and provide more anonymity.
* **Avoid Free Proxies:** They often lack encryption, may log your data, or even sell it.
* **Check for HTTPS:** Always ensure the websites you visit are secure (look for the padlock icon).

1hu1xmz,https://i.redd.it/7d9d0ewe05be1.jpeg,New (unexpected) puppy of 6months introduced to out home with a Med-reactive primary dog of 2 years... Advice? ,"Oooohhhh kay, so some semi-comical preamble before the meat of it. First of all a warning, it's a bit of a long one so I'm sorry about that! But I'm hoping the other dog lovers will hear the story out to get the info, and maybe give some advice on this new situation... 😊

About 2 years ago I made a new years resolution of ""wanting an opportunity to take on more responsibility"". Within a month (February of that year), a close friend's relative offered us a chance to adopt a puppy of <1 year old that they adopted from a rescue while on a vacation. They realized after returning home that having a toddler, another dog, and being currently deep in pregnancy with another on the way, it was a knee-jerk response to adopt the pup and reached out to us (who had recently moved to a new house with access to a good sized backyard and also were looking for a dog.) 

Well, jump forward a couple years, and while that dog is a wonderful and cuddle-hungry fur-baby, she's a bit reactive to other dogs on initial interaction, and also other humans on a cation (she was a rescue, born and bred from the street so there's some defensive aggression towards other dogs. Also the first dog is a female, and definately has almost no reactivity towards female people VS male people.) I will say however that a LOT of progress has been made with her reactivity. She has 2 VERY good dog friends currently which we trust her arround, as do their owners, and have been making extremely good presence with a 3rd friend. We also take her to the off-leash park with one of her close dog-friendos for support, and she does auuuuper well now! 

So to tie in this next part, I feel the need to mention I erroneously made THIS year's new years resolution to have more responsibility again  (needless to say, my wife said I need to stop making that resolution 😂!) 

Welllll now comes the drama; recently we were approached by a fella we have met a few times and he asked us to take in his dog and adopt her from him.. And it's complicated. 

So this fellow is living under some unfortunate circumstances; currently homeless, living out of his car, as well as dealing with some family crises and trying to provide for a young dog. He's had his pup for several months, and on our morning walks we have discussed with some others about our concern about when things got really cold and how his dog would bear it, some of us even trying to hint to him at doing exactly what he did.

Well, yesterday was the day. 

He followed me into the coffee shop on our routine morning walk and asked if we would take her, saying he can't bear to watch her shiver in the car in the now fridged nights, and that he's unable to get ahead in his life because of caring for her. (Don't get me wrong, he did super well on his own with her for a long time!) We found out he was actually putting her up in dog daycare on the cold nights before now (and anyone whose done that knows how pricy that can be, so imagine that expense when you can't even get yourself a place to shack up 💔.) I told him to speak to my wife, and in an hour or so later we're now with two fur-babies. 

Our first dog is currently a bit over 2 years, Med-high reactive (on first interactions primarily) but has been growing very well on her personal skills with other dogs. 

The pup we were gifted (if anyone has seen The Witcher on Netflix, we have been referring to her as out Child Suprise lol) is a 6month old mutt (we don't have her papers yet, we will get them in the very near future.) Also btw our original is also a mutt, but being adopted as an island mutt she's a Potcake.

The new pup is very thin, she hasn't had a proper diet and we are in a transition between the foods the local pet store told us she's been eating (they donated a lot of food for her) and are currently in a proper transition towards the food our first dog is currently on (which is organic and great.) I am feeding her by hand, while feeding our first dog at the same time by placing her dish down as usual and keeping myself and a barrier wall between them as they eat as to not increase tension on food guarding. 

We have her on a high calorie diet due to her unhealthy weight to bulk her up (its an exactly similar situation to our first rescue dog so it's an easy recall on the process of ratios and schedule.) Mainly I'm worried that our first dog will try to eat her poop in the backyard because of how rich the food we give her is lol. I've tried d to offset it by giving the first girl a spoonful of the wet chicken and rice food we heavily add to the second pup's food (so she knows she's still getting that stuff and doesn't need to eat poop to get a taste lol; so far it's working, I do leave a poop outside for a day after seeing where it went to make sure it's not going to be a problem 😂.)

Anyway, onto the advice portion. Unfortunately, even this requires a bit of a preamble 🙄 sorry dog fam! 

So after our dog met the new pup at the pet store near us (same day the fella asked for our help) she was initially reactive; usual behaviour with snarling, teeth gnashing, lunging. But we learnt that taking a pack walk together with the foreign dog always makes that go away, so my wife did that and when they returned everyone was happy. 

So we walked home together, and from there things got complicated hehehe. So our dog, being a rescue from off the street, guards resources. Mom and dad are also a resource that she holds very dear. We showered our dog in hard high-durability chew toys (she's an extreme chewer) and the puppy has never seen such things before, so we're constantly breaking up scuffles over our first dog guarding toys (even ones she wasn't using or weren't even near her, what a bitch! *just being linguistically correct fam 😉.*) Anyway, overall it's not been TOO bad, and we are comming to some interesting revelations. If you notice in the picture, while these two girls are from very different parts of the world they look like they could have been family with their identical features; they have the same white patches on their chest, the same mole location on the if face, very similar fur coloration, the same mottled-skin-belly--- its actually rediculous how similar they look, and I think the new puppy is trying to take our first dog as her mom! She even tried to suckle her the other day (which was hilarious to see) and our dog has been correcting her when she's acting da fool. At first we were trying to stop our dog from being aggressive towards her, , but I had some time alone with them today and decided to observe how things were playing out without intercepting them: Our dog only snaps close to the young pup, warning her to stop her actions, and only one time had I seen our first girl nip the puppy on the cheek after she was nipping at my hands and I was telling her to stop (DON'T NIP MY PAPA!). Needless to say, the pup stopped after that, and that's not all; every time the pup is acting up or being naughty, our first dog seems to be correcting her... And it always gets an immediate submissive response. That said, the pup ALWAYS wants to play with our first, and her energy is explosive. I kind of feel like this is good for both of them, but now comes my reason for posting this (other than sharing the story of a homeless pup comming into a  with a warm home, lots of food and toys, and an energetic mother-figure who also wants to play a lot...) 

I'm worried that our first dog is upset that the new pup is here, and my wife feels like she's pulled away from us a bit because of it. It's not extreme, and we've taken every opportunity to praise her for being a good mama figure to the baby, and still our super-loved pupper. But are there any suggestions to help ease this if anyone has been through this before? It's just so tricky dealing with two different rescues comming from different backgrounds. The pup is also the polar opposite to our first dog; first girl is skittish and spooked easily, doesn't easily warm up to dogs or people. New puppy loves everyone and everything, has no fear, and I've never even seen her startle at anything sudden no matter what it was; just immensely curious. She's also very curious with our first dog, but sometimes her puppy-energy puts a strain on our OG bb and she gets snippy (but then when they play hard or had a long day, they get like the photo. And at the end of the day they both cuddle between my wife and I in our bed and no fuss is made.) 


Anyone have suggestions on making a smooth integration without our first dog becoming  resentful over this new baby sharing her toys, space, and favourite mama and papa? 

Once again, sorry for the huuuuge post! But I felt like having the solid facts would be good! (it's also a bit of a feel good story so, it's a little soul nurturing 😊.) Any advice would be a great consult, including any thoughts on the topics stated before the final question!

I politely request that he fix my order and quickly, remember I'm starving here. I hadn't eaten since last night, that whole pizza wasn't enough to last till 9 FUCKING AM. 

Anyway, he gets uppity, says he don't like my tone. Well I don't like his. I tell him that if he doesn't fix my order he's gonna have a bigger problem than me speaking to his manager. He begrudgingly walks back to the kitchen. I'm certain that the 1911 on my hip had dissuaded any opposition, as it should. 

When he gets back he slams my plate down. I didn't like that very much and I yell at him that he's a terrible waiter and that I intend to fuck him up. My wife escalated things, as she so often does (I will not mention the Applebee's incident here) by pushing her porkchops off the table onto his feet, I'm sure pretending it to be an accident. She always forgets that I can handle these situations myself. 

Well he's had it by now, he grabbed her by turtleneck, I forgot to mention that we are both wearing our matching turtlenecks today, and pushes her backwards out of her chair. (These sweaters are easy to grab, my wife and I both have long necks so we get them tailored to fit, we have somewhere around 8 - 9 inches of collar.)

I've had it now, all I can see is red.

I hit him hard in the jaw and now he has me by my turtleneck. Too easy to grab, not the most tactically sound apparel, I'll admit. There was a shortcoming to looking fashionable, I knew it. He shoved me but at the last moment I managed to balance myself with the table and stand in one graceful movement. I stepped back about 8 feet.

This is what I've trained for. I grabbed my 1911 out of its holster but before I could unholster a mag, load it and chamber a round he was coming right at me, I had no time to think, and did the only logical thing at the time. I threw my 1911 as hard as I could at this man's face. I missed. I domed an old lady behind him. She went facedown in her grits.

The steel frame of the best gun ever made was too much for her I suppose. I never got to check up on her condition. 

My last ditch effort was to throw my plate of biscuits and gravy. The effort it took to release those biscuits is beyond belief. By this time the starvation was causing something akin to psychosis. 

The plate hit him hard and he went down. Just as I was beginning to go find my gun and my mag I dropped the cops showed up. Paramedics rushed the man, the old woman, and my wife out. I was going to jail.

I perp walked my way out, I knew I'd be free once I explained myself, the story, and showed them the blue lives matter sticker on the back glass of my Honda Ridgeline.

They didn't care to talk. So much for protect and serve. Not in this economy. 

Anyway, to save myself the embarrassment of how this ended, just know that I ended up in the county jail. ME. AFTER EVERYTHING I WENT THROUGH. 

Anyway, this post should be a reminder to all to always be cautious of who you are messing with, you never know what they're carrying or the mental state they're in. It's amazing what starvation can do to the human mind. 

Finally, a reminder to all reading this. Never carry one in the chamber if you'd like to keep your balls. ",0,1736065531.0,CCW,7,0.32,False

1hu1msd,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1hu1msd/how_to_manage_feeling_like_an_afterthought/,How to Manage Feeling Like An Afterthought ,"Future me here: I am so sorry this is long, but this story is a lot - please bear with me. 

I am both seeking advice and need a place to vent. I (25F) have been friends with, let's call her Ruby (25F), since we were 14 years old. We've known each other since elementary school, but didn't get close until freshman year of high school. 

To give some context (you can skip this, but it gives a more well-rounded story): we were two people in a close friend group of 4 and frequently hung out one on one. We incidentally went to the same college and had some overlap, but very much had our own lives. Again, we'd hangout just the two of us and we'd invite each other to some larger hangouts with our respective friend groups. I think it's also important to note that she is the kind of person that wants to befriend everyone. Like if she sees someone she had one class with in high school while we / a group are in public she will leave the dinner table to go talk to them for 20+ minutes. I on the other hand, am relatively selective (I genuinely don't know how else to put that and don't mean to sound pompous) with who I invest my time in. I will definitely go up to talk to someone I know, but usually not a high school acquaintance. To be frank, I don't remember a lot of those people anyways. Regardless, I don't judge her for it and think it's pretty cool that she can strike up a convo with someone she hasn't seen in so long.  

More relevant info: A couple of years ago, she moved 8 hours away and I am still living nearby our hometown. Our 4 person friend group from high school still keeps in touch, goes on trips once in awhile, and keeps each other posted about our lives via a snapchat group where we will share various stories or asking for outfit advice, etc. We all live in different states so none of us see each other on the day to day. That being said, Ruby and I will have phone calls sometimes to catch up on each other's lives. They only happen maybe once a year because it's difficult for our schedules to line up, but she will consistently ask me for advice and/or vent about issues with friends where she lives, her boyfriend, and/or family. I am not a big talker so I'm happy to listen and she'll ask some questions about my life as well. 

Anyways, Ruby will come home every so often (maybe 4 times a year) to visit her family for different holidays or, occasionally, a relative's birthday. When she comes back, she tries to fit in seeing as many people as possible, to the point of squeezing in a 1 hour coffee break with one person in between a lunch with another and dinner with someone else. Again, no judgement and I'm a firm believer that you can always choose who you spend your time with, but for the last year I have been the 1 hour (if that) coffee break hangout.

I'm battling between wondering if she's trying to tell me that she no longer values me as a friend or if she's genuinely not aware that it's awful feeling like a last minute fill in and I constantly feel like an afterthought. I have spoken to her about this both in person, on the phone, and over text at various times and it's usually the same story of her not recognizing it as that. I have asked if she's mad or if I did something wrong and she's assured me that I haven't. 

The most recent experience happened two days ago on Friday January 3rd. Ruby asked me on December 17th  if I was free on January 3rd. At that point I had norovirus (which she knew cuz I shared in our group chat) so I didn't answer until the 25th and she asked for dinner and said okay. Ruby told me 4 hours later that she messed up and asked if I was free on Friday the 3rd during happy hour or Saturday the 4th for breakfast. I told her I could do Friday the 3rd, but asked for a time clarification and her response was ""Like 4:30/5-6:30 yeah. I feel like we’d be less rushed if you were free on the 4th but if that doesn’t work we can do the third after work."" The 4th didn't work because I already had plans that I couldn't change. 

Around New Years, she started a group chat with another friend of ours because she asked him, let's call him Andrew, if he was free on Friday the 3rd. He and I planned to have dinner that night after 6:30 so Ruby suggested all of us get together for the 4:30/5-6:30 time slot. Sure, that was fine, I understood she was busy because she had a dinner reservation at 6:30. 

We, meaning Andrew, Ruby, Ruby's boyfriend, and myself get together at 5pm. Ruby tells me she and the bf have dinner reservations at 6:30 so they'll have to leave at 6. What I thought would be around an hour and a half to two hours turned into 1. Okay, whatever, it's fine. I didn't really think about who they were going to dinner with, but at some point during the 1 hour get together, it came up in conversation. They had dinner reservations with two other people we went to high school with that she later texted me ""I haven’t seen them or talked to them in almost 2 years."" Their dinner went from 6:30ish until 10pm (she also told me this later via text). 

She also told me and Andrew that she and the bf were going to a house warming party after their dinner and we could meet up with them if we wanted to. They also told me that they were staying at that person's place. I know the person who was hosting said party so I said sure just send me the information. The housewarming party was also about half a mile away from my place so I told them that we could also get coffee Saturday morning if they wanted to go on a short walk or something because I had some free time in the morning. I didn't get the housewarming party info so I texted her at 8:30pm on Friday saying ""Hey if the invite to Henry’s is still open lmk"" and didn't hear back. 

I texted at 12:25pm on the 4th saying ""Sorry, meant to reach out earlier. You guys ok?"" 

Here's her response (spaces are for different texts): 

""Oh my gd I’m so sorry  

We were at dinner and then took 90 mins to find parking we didn’t get there until 11pm

And I didn’t see your text at ALL

I was not on my phone except to find directions last night I am so sorry

We are at \*insert popular bar name here\* now if you have any interest in joining- with a bunch of my bf's friends from college and will be around for a few hours over at \*insert area of city\* watching the women’s game before we go into \*insert closely area of city\* and watch the men’s

If you don’t actually hate me yet and have any sort of interest in being in a loud environment this evening please come hang with your bf or just you I am SO sorry

I thought I sent the party info last night and I simply didn’t"" 

This isn't the first time her actions have communicated that I've been shoved into an already planned itinerary. It makes me so angry and sad and disappointed because I don't understand why I can't be a priority. I also don't know what to do because I've told her how her actions have made me feel in the past and nothing has changed. I told her this time around that ""I'm just sad I didn't get to see you more"" and her response was ""It was a suppeerrr busy week and our schedules didn’t really overlap this time around :( it’s okie it happens sometimes when I come in. I’d rather get to see you than not at all 😊 Next time I won’t invite Andrew LMAO so you and me and our bfs can hang, but that was just my only time to see him and you this week unfortunately and I wanted to see you both"". 

What makes me mad is the repetition. I get that things happen, but the fact that she made a dinner reservation with people she hasn't seen in two years and, to my knowledge, isn't very close with while I'm shoved in makes me feel so so much like an afterthought. And I'm mad at myself because I don't understand how to set a boundary because I've tried to be reasonable and have made her aware multiple times about how her actions make me feel. I don't want to cut her out of my life or not see her when she's around, but I have felt like absolute trash because of these experiences. 

If anyone has experienced something similar, has any advice, etc. I would really appreciate it. Please try to be respectful and not bash my friend because I can only give so much info. But I just want to protect my peace and would love the advice of the Reddit community to do so. Again, sorry for the essay. 

Thank you,

E.
