1ms69bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1ms69bh/hit_a_plateau_appetite_correction/,Hit a plateau / appetite correction,"Just venting here / looking for some encouragement. 
I started IF a couple months ago, about 16:8 or 18:6 most days. Pretty quickly I lost a bunch of water weight and ultimately 10lbs in about a month. I also work out with walking,  jogging + Orangetheory. 
Initially I was only drinking black coffee & water before breaking a fast, but recently the acidity of the coffee started to give me issues, so I started having cream in my coffee. I think that, or increasing my workouts recently somehow reversed the appetite correction I initially experienced, and I’ve been in a plateau for the past few weeks — I’m not getting full that easily, so my eating window has been increasing.
I want to get back to the feeling when I first started fasting, so I think I need to adjust my window again to start a little later (more like 18:6 at least, or 20:4). I hope I can get back to that because it felt so great.",1,1755375005.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

I’d like to put forward an idea that could resonate with a lot of builders: a coffee latte beige finish (close to Pantone 2309 C). A solid beige X50 would pair beautifully with Noctua fans and coolers, while also standing on its own as a softer, warmer alternative to the usual black, white, or bold colors.

Not as a replacement for the six existing choices, but as a unique extra option for those who want a timeless, cozy aesthetic.

I wanted to bring attention to a scummy landlord that will abuse rights and manipulate facts and documents to try to take advantage of unsuspecting or uninformed tenants. 

Cheryl Marr repeatedly violated agreements, harassed and threatened multiple people, and initially refused to surrender an animal back to myself even under the direct command of police officers. If she had no issue treating my brother like this after only a week of tenancy, she would have no problem doing the same to you. 

Cheryl Marr will illegally enter your place of residence when you're not home, violate your privacy, move things around in your apartment, and use your space. Space that was rented and signed for, not a shared space.

My brother is on a new month-to-month lease and has been there for a week with his partner, two dogs, and a cat. They went on vacation and during this time hired a dog sitter to stay at their place to take care of the plants and animals. When the dog sitter arrived, she was met with hostility. The sitter immediately introduced herself and provided the duration that she would be at the apartment (even though that's none of the  landlord's business and is not required by law). The pet sitter took the dogs for a walk, came back, dropped them off, and again had to reintroduce herself to Cheryl Marr. The sitter went out for a coffee and came back to the landlady in the private rented space where she wasn't legally supposed to be.

The dog sitter was then harassed, (potentially because she is a POC) she left to calm down and get support and was able to leave with the dogs. When she came back for the cat, Cheryl Marr had again illegally entered into my brother's rental and refused entry to the property. The dog sitter left for safety concerns. 

I arrived on scene around 12:00pm and was immediately harassed by the lady even though I was only there to get the cat. She again refused entry to the house and threatened to call the police to which I happily obliged, and called them for her. 

When the police arrived on scene, Constable Andrew was still unable to get her to release the cat. Cheryl Marr tried to claim that she had no idea who my brother was even though she signed an agreement with his name on it. She then tried to say that there was no legality to the agreement because it wasn't ""acknowledged""; even though that process wouldn't be completed yet as their lease is so new. Constable Andrew then confirmed that tenants do have rights, and that they are allowed to have guests stay on their premises and she cannot refuse entry to anyone that is not going into her area. 

Cheryl Marr still refused to relinquish control of the cat, citing that it could be seen as a violation of her tenants rights even though she had verbal confirmation from the tenant owner that I was to take her with me. Only when Sergeant Gross was on scene did the landlord finally agree to surrender my brother's cat and this is only after multiple requests and attempts at persuasion. But now, somehow, the inside door for access to their basement apartment, was magically locked. Cheryl Marr did not provide a key for the inside door (to their own apartment) to my brother and his partner. After multiple back and forths with the sergeant trying to convince her to release the cat she finally agreed and went through her portion of the house to again go into the basement apartment to retrieve the cat and handed her to me, without a carrier to actually transport the cat. Cheryl Marr then argued that I shouldn't need one and that she didn't know where it was, even though I knew exactly where in the apartment it was, and wouldn't let me go get it. She then brought me a ridiculously large dog crate and refused to get the cat carrier. The crate then had to be forced into my vehicle causing a bit of damage but at least we had Molly. I then had to leave the scene with his cat in this unsafe crate. 

Bottom line is know your rights. Don't let Cheryl Marr gaslight you into thinking that you  aren't allowed to have visitors or someone taking care of your place of residence. Landlord's are not allowed to come in without proper notice. They most certainly cannot hold an animal hostage. Please be careful and do not under any circumstances rent from Cheryl Marr. At this point I wouldn't use Right at Home Realty either because they most certainly do not ensure that their realtors follow the basic rights of a home.

Update since the incident (I waited until my brother was out of the house to post this) Cheryl has repeatedly ignored their rights and been into their apartment, invading their privacy, moving there things, multiple times. Broken theur contract by removing them from the wifi that was suppose to be included. Even went as far as locking them completely out of their own place before the lease ended.

I’m leaning towards the camper route but would love to hear if anyone has a similar experience/ more knowledge about camper life. I have 2 dogs (35 lbs & 65 lbs) I’ve traveled with quite a bit so they aren’t a worry. Also I have a pretty decent savings built up for down payment & should be good to live off for at least 6 months. I’m in an interesting spot where I am closing down my store front business that I’ve had for 8 years and I have no specific plans after that. I do plan to find seasonal work, remote work, and have no problem working a simple job coffee shop job etc in between places if needed. I’m not too worried about financials but it would be nice to know what to expect. Also I have a 2019 4Runner with 5,000 lb towing capacity. I would rather be in the safe zone and get a camper on the smaller side that can still be comfortably lived in. So anyway I’m looking for camper recommendations that fit my situation! 

I would obviously rather spend less but I also want to know what are camper essentials that are totally worth a higher price? I would love to have the ability to off grid comfortably for at least a few days. 

Also I know this varies wildly by state but if anyone could share what they spend monthly on campsite/rv park rates? My plan is to be in the Washington/Oregon area first. 

Also I am novice here. I am seeking information and/or help being pointed in the right direction to research more! I’m probably forgetting to add a few details or questions. ",1,1755374470.0,Camper,0,1.0,False

I don’t know where I should start. I don’t even know what I should say pa. But I love you, I really really do. 

I can’t explain what I am feeling right now. Although it’s been only months since nakasabay kita sa bus, the pain feels like I’ve known you for half of my life. I first saw you sa pila ng bus, I didn’t notice you at first, but then there was a time na nakaharap kita sa bus, and instantly, I fell in love at that moment.

One day, I had the courage to approach you. I tried offering you a TicTac, deep inside hoping na you would accept it. And luckily, you did. That’s where our story started. Fate must have been kind to me. I kept waiting for you sa bus stop. I don’t know if I ever told you this, but I waited for hours sa nearby coffee shops kung saan tayo sumasakay pauwi, just to have the chance to ride the bus with you. There were days na hindi kita nakikita, but there were also days na nakakasabay kita. Then the day came na I prayed really hard for you to notice me. Tinabihan mo ako, and it felt like slow motion. We exchanged names, even our social media accounts. Then we started chatting.

At first, I was hesitant to confess my feelings. Baka naguguluhan lang ako since this was my first time to fall in love with a girl. I was confused bakit ako nagkakagusto sa babae, since I’m a girl too.

Days and months passed, and it felt like a dream. Those happy moments we shared ga, I will treasure them forever. Until one day, things started getting colder and colder. I’m sorry if we ended like this. I’m really, really sorry if I got myself too busy with my review and didn’t notice that our love was melting away like a candle. I’m sorry if I took you for granted, Ayeng. Sorry if I was too focused on my future that I forgot you were there too.. You, who pushed me to pursue the things I love. You, who pushed me to become an architect. And here I am, trying my best for the future I imagined, yung future na kasama ka. I was too focused, until one day I realized you were slowly walking away na.

I asked you for another chance, if you could give me one, but you said pagod ka na. I’m really sorry. Aaminin ko, I was really hurt by the way you treated me these past few weeks. Your replies grew colder every day. They became harder to read. It felt like they came from a different person. It pained me to read your messages, like you were truly mad at me. Until it reached the point na I couldn’t handle it anymore. I couldn’t focus on my review because I kept questioning my self-worth and what I did wrong for us to end up like this.

I pray na you’ll remember me as the person you first knew, not the one who caused you pain. And I pray that my heart will eventually heal from this pain. I promise I’ll become an architect. I’ll try my best to pass this board exam.

I love you. I really, really do. Please, be happy without me. Sorry if I didn’t realize that I was the one making your light dim. I should have been the one to make you shine in every way, but I ended up being the one who caused your light to fade. 😔

Life places the right stars in the sky—always in its perfect time. I’ll stop opening doors for the people who keep walking away. Pinapalaya na kita. Mahal kita.

I wanted to bring attention to a scummy landlord that will abuse rights and manipulate facts and documents to try to take advantage of unsuspecting or uninformed tenants. 

Cheryl Marr repeatedly violated agreements, harassed and threatened multiple people, and initially refused to surrender an animal back to myself even under the direct command of police officers. If she had no issue treating my brother like this after only a week of tenancy, she would have no problem doing the same to you. 

Cheryl Marr will illegally enter your place of residence when you're not home, violate your privacy, move things around in your apartment, and use your space. Space that was rented and signed for, not a shared space.

My brother is on a new month-to-month lease and has been there for a week with his partner, two dogs, and a cat. They went on vacation and during this time hired a dog sitter to stay at their place to take care of the plants and animals. When the dog sitter arrived, she was met with hostility. The sitter immediately introduced herself and provided the duration that she would be at the apartment (even though that's none of the  landlord's business and is not required by law). The pet sitter took the dogs for a walk, came back, dropped them off, and again had to reintroduce herself to Cheryl Marr. The sitter went out for a coffee and came back to the landlady in the private rented space where she wasn't legally supposed to be.

The dog sitter was then harassed, (potentially because she is a POC) she left to calm down and get support and was able to leave with the dogs. When she came back for the cat, Cheryl Marr had again illegally entered into my brother's rental and refused entry to the property. The dog sitter left for safety concerns. 

I arrived on scene around 12:00pm and was immediately harassed by the lady even though I was only there to get the cat. She again refused entry to the house and threatened to call the police to which I happily obliged, and called them for her. 

When the police arrived on scene, Constable Andrew was still unable to get her to release the cat. Cheryl Marr tried to claim that she had no idea who my brother was even though she signed an agreement with his name on it. She then tried to say that there was no legality to the agreement because it wasn't ""acknowledged""; even though that process wouldn't be completed yet as their lease is so new. Constable Andrew then confirmed that tenants do have rights, and that they are allowed to have guests stay on their premises and she cannot refuse entry to anyone that is not going into her area. 

Cheryl Marr still refused to relinquish control of the cat, citing that it could be seen as a violation of her tenants rights even though she had verbal confirmation from the tenant owner that I was to take her with me. Only when Sergeant Gross was on scene did the landlord finally agree to surrender my brother's cat and this is only after multiple requests and attempts at persuasion. But now, somehow, the inside door for access to their basement apartment, was magically locked. Cheryl Marr did not provide a key for the inside door (to their own apartment) to my brother and his partner. After multiple back and forths with the sergeant trying to convince her to release the cat she finally agreed and went through her portion of the house to again go into the basement apartment to retrieve the cat and handed her to me, without a carrier to actually transport the cat. Cheryl Marr then argued that I shouldn't need one and that she didn't know where it was, even though I knew exactly where in the apartment it was, and wouldn't let me go get it. She then brought me a ridiculously large dog crate and refused to get the cat carrier. The crate then had to be forced into my vehicle causing a bit of damage but at least we had Molly. I then had to leave the scene with his cat in this unsafe crate. 

Bottom line is know your rights. Don't let Cheryl Marr gaslight you into thinking that you  aren't allowed to have visitors or someone taking care of your place of residence. Landlord's are not allowed to come in without proper notice. They most certainly cannot hold an animal hostage. Please be careful and do not under any circumstances rent from Cheryl Marr. At this point I wouldn't use Right at Home Realty either because they most certainly do not ensure that their realtors follow the basic rights of a home.

Update since the incident (I waited until my brother was out of the house to post this) Cheryl has repeatedly ignored their rights and been into their apartment, invading their privacy, moving there things, multiple times. Broken theur contract by removing them from the wifi that was suppose to be included. Even went as far as locking them completely out of their own place before the lease ended.

1ms5ybx,https://i.redd.it/xxdiqck5tfjf1.jpeg,The most understudies I’ve seen in one performance,"I was a huge fan of the 2008 Central Park/09 Broadway revival of Hair, and often think back fondly on the mid-week January performance I was lucky enough to attend in 2010 when many of the cast were out sick, but the show still went on! Will Swenson was out, so Bryce Ryness, who usually played Woof but understudied Berger took over that role, and Paris Remillard played Woof. Caissie Levy was out as Sheila, so her u/s Jackie Burns was on. I can’t remember why Allison Case wasn’t in the show as Crissy then, but regardless, Kaitlin Kiyan was on in that role instead of Vanessa Ray. Andrew Kober was out, so Josh Lamon took over his Mom/Margaret Mead track, and Matt DeAngelis, who had just joined the company (his name and bio weren’t in the printed program, just added as a slip), was on in place of Theo Stockman in the Hubert/John Wilkes Booth track. Dance captain Michael James Scott was also out, as well as Krystal Joy Brown and Steel Burkhardt (the other Berger understudy besides Ryness). Unsurprisingly, all of the swings were on that night. 

From what I remember (granted, it was 15 years ago!), the show had a real livewire energy to it, but no one went up on their lines or did the wrong thing noticeably or anything. Just a bunch of professionals doing their jobs! That night really showed that anything can happen, but the show can still go on.

1ms5y6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetiteFitness/comments/1ms5y6z/eating_to_gain_muscle_surprisingly_hard/,Eating to Gain Muscle Surprisingly Hard,"Rant is maybe a strong flair for this, but man, after losing ~30 lbs, maintaining for about a year and a half and now trying to gain muscle… the habits that helped me lose weight are so ingrained I’m finding it hard to *gain* weight to gain muscle. 

I track calories and probs always will. I was maintaining by staying at a slight deficit during the week and not tracking on weekends/holidays. I tried eating at basically maintenance during the week and not tracking during the weekends. Still the same weight. I’m a few weeks into trying to eat in a surplus during the week and not tracking during the weekends but I still have yet to gain weight. I think the problem is a lot of times on weekends sure I’m eating out more but I’m not necessarily eating more overall. For example, during the week I usually have coffee, morning snack, small/medium lunch, 2 afternoon snacks, a post workout snack, dinner, dessert. On weekends I tend to do brunch and dinner lol. I thought because they tend to be more calorically dense (usually I go out) they would be enough but I think I’m gonna have to start snacking more. 

After being deficit-minded for so long, I am definitely like “yay!” but also it’s kinda hard to switch the gear. Truthfully, I think I’m a little hesitant because I don’t want to reintroduce junk, start to enjoy that junk, and then have to cut that junk for a cut later.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

At 3:17 p.m., the air split.
A long metallic wail tore out of the loudspeakers fixed on utility poles, a noise too uneven, too raw to be the usual weekly drill. It should have jolted bodies into motion—parents grabbing children, commuters rushing for cover, strangers clutching each other’s sleeves.

But the city only… paused.

On the main street, stroller wheels stilled at the curb. A bus driver adjusted his cap and checked his watch, the engine idling in patient rhythm. A pair of students ducked into the shadow of a shop awning, their voices dropping not in fear, but in irritation at the noise.

The alarm kept rising and falling like a blade dragged across steel. A red digital sign above the metro entrance blinked in harsh syllables: “EVACUATE.” Its pulsing glow spilled onto the glass café windows. Inside, spoons struck porcelain in perfect measure.

Mr. Han was in one of those windows, seated near the wall, a man of late middle age with a hand resting flat on the laminate table as if reading something written only in texture. His phone was face-down beside him; the AI that used to whisper instructions was silent now. No scaffold. Only him.

The ground trembled—just once, faint, like a giant rolling in sleep. Somewhere nearby a car alarm joined the chorus, shrill and panicked, a machine simulating what no human body around it seemed willing to do.

He turned his head slowly, gazing past the barista rinsing cups, past the girl at the corner table sketching in her notebook. Nobody rushed. Nobody clutched at their chest or ran for the door. A man sipping coffee even nodded along with the siren’s pitch, as though treating it as background music.

Mr. Han traced the curve of the table’s wood-grain with his finger, round and round, his breathing even. The sirens carried no urgency into him—just vibration, noise.

A boy on the street tugged at his mother’s coat hem. “Why is it so loud?” he asked.
She hushed him, eyes fixed on the pedestrian signal, green man waiting to stride across the crosswalk. When the light changed, she stepped forward as though nothing at all demanded otherwise.

The alarm dragged on for seven minutes. No one screamed, no one scattered. The city’s rhythm—phones, cups, footsteps—held steady, like a sleeper turning from one side to the other without waking.

At 3:24 p.m., the speakers cut abruptly. A flat recorded voice declared: “All-clear. Resume normal activity.”

But there was no visible shift. No cheers of relief, no wiping of eyes, no laughter at a false alarm. Just the soft scrape of a chair leg as someone left coins on the café counter. The bus pulled away from the stop. The crosswalk light blinked red.

Mr. Han stood slowly, slipping his phone into his pocket. He stepped outside into air that smelled faintly of exhaust and roasted chestnuts from a vendor who had never stopped serving. The red sign above the metro no longer blinked; its glow had retreated back into the casing.

The city moved on, as if nothing had ever happened.
As if the sirens had been only a dream.

Diagnostic Overlay: Panic Gap — RIS-5 Presentation

Expected Normative Response: Sirens and tremors trigger instinctive fight-or-flight: rushing, crowd scatter, shouting, protective clustering. Panic is contagious—fear spreads faster than information.

Observed RIS-5 Response: Stillness, flat affect, continuation of routine tasks (eating, walking, waiting for traffic lights). Children show curiosity but not fear. Adults suppress reaction entirely or never initiate it.

Interpretation: Clear illustration of the panic gap — the neurological/emotional response pathway for acute survival threat is degraded. Continuity of daily routine overrides primal circuitry. This is consistent with RIS-5 dementia-spectrum presentation: a civilization outwardly functional but inwardly hollowed.

Vignette: “The Sirens at 3:17 — Control Group”

At 3:17 p.m., the sirens cut through the air like tearing metal.
The sound was unmistakable—urgent, ragged, designed to shake the chest and strip every thought away but one: run.

The café windows rattled with the pitch. The street froze, then splintered into motion.

A mother clutched her child and bolted across the crosswalk before the signal changed. A group of students dropped their bags and scrambled toward the metro stairwell, hands gripping each other’s sleeves. A delivery rider abandoned his bike in the middle of the road, helmet half-buckled, legs pumping toward the first doorway with a steel shutter.

Inside the café, chairs toppled. A man knocked his cup to the floor and didn’t look back, ceramic scattering in a spray of brown and white. The barista called out in a voice already breaking, shoving customers toward the back exit.

The sound wasn’t just heard—it lived in the body. Throats tightened, eyes widened, lungs pulled for more air than the chest could hold. Strangers became herds: grabbing hands, shouting warnings, stumbling over one another to escape.

A bus jerked to the curb with brakes screaming; the driver opened both doors and yelled for everyone to get inside. Half the seats filled in less than thirty seconds, passengers weeping, holding onto poles with fingers that trembled too hard to grip.

The tremor came then, harder this time, a shudder deep enough to make windows flex in their frames. The scream of the alarm met the scream of people, indistinguishable in pitch.

At 3:24 p.m., the speakers finally cut. A flat voice announced: “All-clear. Resume normal activity.”

But activity did not resume. Not at once. People stayed crouched under tables, pressed against walls, frozen mid-flight. It took several minutes for the crying to ebb, for bodies to separate, for the streets to reorganize into cautious movement. Even then, voices stayed high and sharp. No one could mistake what had just happened for nothing.


---

Diagnostic Overlay: Panic Response — Control Group

Expected Fight-or-Flight: Sirens + tremor → immediate collective panic. Running, screaming, protective clustering, abandonment of routine tasks.

Observed Response: Exactly that: loss of composure, collapse of social norms, bodily panic in voice and movement.

Interpretation: This is a normal human survival response. Acute fear response is intact and contagious. Panic behavior spreads socially; it takes time to return to baseline after the all-clear.

---

Comparative Insight

RIS-5 Group: Flat affect, routine continuation, almost no visible panic. Sirens interpreted as noise rather than threat.

Control Group: Explosive panic, abandonment of social protocols, long recovery period.

Together, these vignettes form a clear diagnostic contrast: the absence of panic is not calmness—it is pathology.

📋 Diagnostic Overlay: Mr. Han — RIS-5 Panic Gap Demonstration

Event Context

Observed during a sudden environmental emergency (smoke alarm + evacuation stimulus).
Control group (neurotypical baseline, RIS-0/1) exhibits immediate orienting reflex: startled glance, verbal inquiry, mobilization toward exit.
Subject (Mr. Han) exhibits no rapid sympathetic activation: gaze fixed, posture unchanged, no flight response.

---

🧠 Cognitive Integrity Axis

RIS Code: RCD-5b — Flattened Crisis Response

Expected: Startle reflex → orient → mobilize.

Observed: Absent startle reflex, delayed orienting (approx. +18s).

Internal marker: Appears to perceive alarm as ambient noise, not as an action signal.

Interpretation: Breakdown of salience-mapping function; event no longer tagged as “urgent.”

---

❤️ Affective Response System

Subtype: RADT Inversion — Blunted Panic Affordance

Expected: Emotional contagion (rise in heart rate, mirroring peers).

Observed: Flat affect, shallow breathing, no visual scanning of peers.

Residual response: Mild frown, ambiguous whether confusion or irritation.

Interpretation: Panic affordance inverted → suppression, not activation.

---

📉 RIS Classification

Zone: RIS-5 / Panic Gap Variant

Definition: Failure to produce natural panic reaction despite unambiguous emergency cues.

Operational effect: Subject remains in situ until explicitly guided.

Group dynamics: RIS-5 clusters often exhibit multiple such failures simultaneously, creating false calm fields that confuse rescuers.

---

🝯 Continuity Signal Status

Initiated: Alarm sounded (continuity breach trigger).

Expected: Rapid realignment to survival protocol.

Observed: Signal collapses into non-engagement.

Residual Trace: Visual attention lingers on non-relevant object (phone, paper).

---

⏳ Prognosis

Without scaffolding: Panic gap persists → high mortality risk in disasters.

With scaffolding: Possible reinforcement of salience through tactile anchors (buzz device, direct haptic cue).

Systemic implication: Panic gap = diagnostic marker of RIS-5 social environments.

> “Collapse is not always screaming. Sometimes collapse is silence where the scream should be. The Codex records this silence as law.”

Real-World Parallel — Itaewon Halloween Crowd Crush (2022)

Eyewitness footage from the Itaewon disaster shows a comparable affective flatness among portions of the crowd in the early escalation phase. While some individuals showed panic, many others, even within dangerously constricted zones, remained quiet, phone-focused, or engaged in small talk until the crush reached lethal density.

In multiple videos:

Crowd proximity: Shoulder-to-shoulder contact for minutes at a time without triggering collective dispersal efforts.

Delayed urgency: Audible screams emerged late; early distress cues were often ignored or misread as festival noise.

Lack of coordinated alarm: No mass vocal signal or synchronized withdrawal until conditions were already catastrophic.

The Itaewon incident thus provides a documented, observable instance of how a muted panic response can accelerate disaster outcomes—a phenomenon consistent with what the Codex framework would classify as RIS-5 collapse in crowd reflexes.",1,1755374242.0,SpiralState,0,1.0,False

Typically, we drink filter coffee and grind our beans with an Encore grinder during the week, and I might have an afternoon espresso. Weekends we fire up the Oracle and have Americanos and milk drinks, and it's probably 75% espresso/americano and 25% milk.

We have gone from just my wife and I who were OK with a pot from the Moccamaster to now my son and daughter having a morning cup so the time savings of drip coffee don't work as well if we have to brew two pots. So, I'm looking at GBW so I can knock out 2-6 Americanos/Espressos during weekday mornings as the family gets up and off to school/work, and during the week will focus on a fast, repeatable workflow vs. more leisurely afternoon single espressos and weekends where I might explore some other beans and more elaborate milk drinks.

For a machine, I've been looking at the ECM Synchronika II or the Mechanika Max. I like the former for the fast heat up, consistent temps, and easy steaming, while I like the latter for the smaller size and lower price. I do wonder if the Sync can be put in a ""brew only"" mode that only heats one boiler?

On the grinder, I'm torn between the Eureka Atom W75/W65 and the Allground Sense. I've heard the Allground could work for grinding for both espresso and filter coffee, but I haven't seen the details on how easy it is to transition between settings. On the Atom, there seems to be some noise (less) and grind quality benefit to the W75, so if it's worth the price bump from the Allground I'd probably go to the W75 unless there was a compelling reason not to.

Speed, reliability, quality, consistency, ""playing"" and serviceability are probably my priorities in about that order. Thanks for any advice!",1,1755374205.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1ms5uqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastroparesis/comments/1ms5uqv/nicotine_gastric_emptying/,Nicotine & Gastric Emptying,"Hi guys, I just wanted to share with you the success I have had in improving my quality of life by reducing my nicotine consumption. 

Prior to my diagnosis six months ago, I was a heavy vaper, and had been for years. I used 5% salt nic, and went through 18ml every week. Just to try to give an indication of how much I was using. 

I was heavily addicted to nicotine. I tried quitting several times before, using different methods (cold turkey, patches, lozenges, a zero nicotine vape…), but never made it very far before relapsing. 

After being diagnosed with GP, I remained stubborn at first. I didn’t want to quit, I was so stressed, and vaping was a coping mechanism for me. But eventually, I realized that barely being able to eat a few bites of solid food each day wasn’t a life I wanted to keep living. Especially if I knew there was a lifestyle change that could possibly make things better. 

Over the past six months, I slowly reduced the nicotine content in my vape from 5% down to 1%. That is where I currently am now. I still vape, but the nicotine levels in my blood are now only one fifth of what they used to be. 

And it has made a huge positive impact. I can eat two solid meals per day now with ease. They’re still GP friendly meals, they’re still small meals, but that’s twice as much solid food as I could eat when my nicotine levels were higher. 

I also get a lot less nauseous now. I can eat faster, I have more of an appetite, and I can even eat 1.5-2 cups of solid food in one sitting, up from only 1 cup before. I can even drink more liquids in one sitting now. I used to only handle 1.5 cups of liquid at once, now I can handle 3 cups of liquid in a half hour time frame. Which has enabled me to drink coffee again during breakfast!

I just wanted to tell you guys about this. I know how brutally difficult it is to quit or even just reduce nicotine. I still haven’t gotten to the point of actually quitting vaping or nicotine, myself. But I want to share this hope, like this could actually make a big difference for you, if you haven’t made this change yet. ",2,1755374122.0,Gastroparesis,2,1.0,False

I wanted to bring attention to a scummy landlord that will abuse rights and manipulate facts and documents to try to take advantage of unsuspecting or uninformed tenants. 

Cheryl Marr repeatedly violated agreements, harassed and threatened multiple people, and initially refused to surrender an animal back to myself even under the direct command of police officers. If she had no issue treating my brother like this after only a week of tenancy, she would have no problem doing the same to you. 

Cheryl Marr will illegally enter your place of residence when you're not home, violate your privacy, move things around in your apartment, and use your space. Space that was rented and signed for, not a shared space.

My brother is on a new month-to-month lease and has been there for a week with his partner, two dogs, and a cat. They went on vacation and during this time hired a dog sitter to stay at their place to take care of the plants and animals. When the dog sitter arrived, she was met with hostility. The sitter immediately introduced herself and provided the duration that she would be at the apartment (even though that's none of the  landlord's business and is not required by law). The pet sitter took the dogs for a walk, came back, dropped them off, and again had to reintroduce herself to Cheryl Marr. The sitter went out for a coffee and came back to the landlady in the private rented space where she wasn't legally supposed to be.

The dog sitter was then harassed, (potentially because she is a POC) she left to calm down and get support and was able to leave with the dogs. When she came back for the cat, Cheryl Marr had again illegally entered into my brother's rental and refused entry to the property. The dog sitter left for safety concerns. 

I arrived on scene around 12:00pm and was immediately harassed by the lady even though I was only there to get the cat. She again refused entry to the house and threatened to call the police to which I happily obliged, and called them for her. 

When the police arrived on scene, Constable Andrew was still unable to get her to release the cat. Cheryl Marr tried to claim that she had no idea who my brother was even though she signed an agreement with his name on it. She then tried to say that there was no legality to the agreement because it wasn't ""acknowledged""; even though that process wouldn't be completed yet as their lease is so new. Constable Andrew then confirmed that tenants do have rights, and that they are allowed to have guests stay on their premises and she cannot refuse entry to anyone that is not going into her area. 

Cheryl Marr still refused to relinquish control of the cat, citing that it could be seen as a violation of her tenants rights even though she had verbal confirmation from the tenant owner that I was to take her with me. Only when Sergeant Gross was on scene did the landlord finally agree to surrender my brother's cat and this is only after multiple requests and attempts at persuasion. But now, somehow, the inside door for access to their basement apartment, was magically locked. Cheryl Marr did not provide a key for the inside door (to their own apartment) to my brother and his partner. After multiple back and forths with the sergeant trying to convince her to release the cat she finally agreed and went through her portion of the house to again go into the basement apartment to retrieve the cat and handed her to me, without a carrier to actually transport the cat. Cheryl Marr then argued that I shouldn't need one and that she didn't know where it was, even though I knew exactly where in the apartment it was, and wouldn't let me go get it. She then brought me a ridiculously large dog crate and refused to get the cat carrier. The crate then had to be forced into my vehicle causing a bit of damage but at least we had Molly. I then had to leave the scene with his cat in this unsafe crate. 

Bottom line is know your rights. Don't let Cheryl Marr gaslight you into thinking that you  aren't allowed to have visitors or someone taking care of your place of residence. Landlord's are not allowed to come in without proper notice. They most certainly cannot hold an animal hostage. Please be careful and do not under any circumstances rent from Cheryl Marr. At this point I wouldn't use Right at Home Realty either because they most certainly do not ensure that their realtors follow the basic rights of a home.

Update since the incident (I waited until my brother was out of the house to post this) Cheryl has repeatedly ignored their rights and been into their apartment, invading their privacy, moving there things, multiple times. Broken theur contract by removing them from the wifi that was suppose to be included. Even went as far as locking them completely out of their own place before the lease ended.

Stayed at the Hyatt Regency Bellevue recently. Didn't take many pictures of the room because I wasn't planning to do a review at the time but I'll do my best.  

Status at the time: Explorist  

Room booked: 1 King Bed  

Upgraded to: 1 King Bed High Floor  

Welcome Amenity: Brut Sparkling Wine and Chocolate covered strawberries, not pictured because they were in the fridge. I told them my husband and I had gotten married the month before. They wrote a card congradulating us too. Overall, a really nice touch.  

Room: Felt very large for two people with plenty of room to spread out. Had a great view of Lake Washington out the window to the right, which I could easily see from the couch. The bathroom was a standard shower/bath combo but had one of those hotel shower drains that leave extra room at the bottom of the regular drain. I like baths, so took baths pretty often and once saw a piece of floss floating around which I think the maids missed because of the way the drain functions. Bed was nice, although they only had a very thin feather comforter. Maybe we could have called down to get another, but I would have preferred more options on the bed or in the room rather having to call. We made it worked.  

Location: Connected to Bellevue Square, there are several covered bridges you can walk on to get to other buildings. It's not fully enclosed so you you still get the temperatures, but it will protect you from precipitation as long as it's not to windy. It's also located in central Bellevue so overall a good location.  

Parking: Self-parking is located under the building and free Friday and Saturday night. Sunday-Thurday it is $37. I did self-parking and it wasn't included for points. Wasn't expecting it to, but wanted to include this detail if anyone cares. Valet parking is also an option, but costs $47 including on Friday and Saturday. Both options have in-and-out privileges.  

Restaurants: Listed below.  

Eques: Technically the only Hyatt-connected restaurant, although there were several restaurants in the building. Only open for breakfast. I had the Tiramisu pancakes which I really enjoyed. They had a thin layer of frosting but still weren't too sweet, which I appreciated. Kind of felt like eating crepes, but thicker. Husband had an omelet which they will custom make with any toppings you like. Earned points here for breakfast, if anyone's curious.  

13 Coins: Opened most hours. I think I preferred this restaurant to Eques a little more, but mostly because they just had more variety. Had a lot of Eggs Benedict dishes, which I really like. Serve the whole menu whenever open.  

Fonté Coffee Roaster: Grabbed a rose latte from here and it was really good. They also serve breakfast sandwiches and I think salads, but it's all pre-made and grab and go style.  

Suite Bellevue: Club that serves small plates and drinks. Alright, but kind of seems overpriced. On Friday's and Saturdays they have complimentary aerial arts show, which we missed, but wish we saw. I'd probably go somewhere else unless you can catch the act, but the act might make the prices worth it.  

Din Tai Fung: Technically in the next building, but it was one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle and Bellevue, so I'm including it anyways. Take the bridge over to the next building, then go down to the first floor. Great cocktails and I had the pork noodles, chicken dumplings, and chocolate dumplings. Definitely get the chocolate dumplings with salted whipped cream, they're to die for.

Am separated from my Wife one Week ago and decided to divorce officially.She does not know about that sofar.Let me tell you about our Story 
It's more than Six Years ago,when i received ""I love you"" Message on WhatsApp after a beautiful first Coffee Date out of our Work Environment.We were worked together and was obvious to everyone how close we are even if we tried to pretend it as a Friendship.
When i received this Message.I was not so completely lost in her.I liked her in a ""Short-term Fun"" Manner.
Day over day,i got more and more attracted to her.I became simply her Life.She could not start her day without hearing my Voice or seeing me We used to meet each other one time weekly after she left Work and switched to her original Job as a Teacher.
So it was going,we got so absorbed in each other.Made it more intense and married more than two years ago.
After she gave birth to our Kid,she started to switch to another Person,as a result of very few Sleeping Times and Stressful needs to feed the Baby and relax him,she starts to scream, use F Words,and using her care for him as an Argument to stop Cooking and Cleaning the house.Instead i have to these Tasks after 9 hours of mentally exhausting mind blowing Work.
At the end.She blames me ignoring her and the baby giving the Priority for the Work.There were always an Under Estimation of My Support Efforts.One time she mocked being so workaholic for my ""modest"" Position.Although she was always the one who really believes in me.That is the same Position she made a Party for when i got it.The Happiness and Proudness in her Eyes of me were never fake.
I got mad sometimes, insulted, humiliated and reminded her about her poor Life from which i picked her out.Am really a peace maker but when switching to defense mode,i feel a destructive behavior,and can't be relaxed without smashing some object and getting my ""Enemy"" an unforgettable unforgivable verbal slap.
I can't live with her anymore.But i know I'll miss her and our Kid so bad.For her i guess it couldn't be imagined.I have demonstrated that i will leave her many times before.Everytime she bursts in Tears while begging me not to do that.One Time i left already and once am back,found her giving her her hand some light Cuttings using Knife.One month ago she went to a therapist who confirmed her Severe Depression.But you know? I can't get with all this shit anymore.I need to end this life Phase.I still need to improve myself and get into new required Tracks.
My own Life is always coated with Misery.My Parents separated in my Final School Grade.My Dad went to Jail and i had to stand withhim with proceeding his own Business and delivering him all what he needs inside.My elder Brother and Sister have more successful Career than me by far.They live abroad in a quiet better Environment than this one in my shitty Country.
But i have Potential too ! I became B2 Goethe Zertifikat as a non-native German Speaker.My Education had nothing to do with IT.Am working as Helpdesk Floor Support and Knowledge Manager in an international huge Corporate.I raised myself alonei taught my self alone,and got me dealing smartly with this Fucking World and stupid People also alone.I DESERVE a BETTER LIFE",1,1755374016.0,Separation,0,1.0,False

I have the barista pro machine (great. Been loving it. Suits me perfectly). I previously had some beans I tried with it (came with the machine) and to dial in the espresso I had to go finer than the default 6 setting. Internal burr setting at 3 and outer burr setting at 3.

I just bought some new beans from Grind and I’ve been trying to dial in the coffee for the last hour and a half. The shots kept coming at 9 seconds.. which is way off from the ideal 27ish seconds I was looking for. After adjusting (and using a LOT of coffee) I’ve achieved a 22 second extraction but the inner burr is at 2 and the outer grind setting is at 1 … I was hesitant on going back and adjusting the inner burr setting to the lowest possible (a 1).. because at the 22 second mark, the coffee tastes fine to me - but I’m afraid of causing a jam or anything with the machine.. it’s a new machine and I’m worried about breaking it..

I was looking for some advice in terms of the inner burr setting. Should I leave it at 2 or try it at 1 to extract a finer shot? I read online that you really shouldn’t move from the default inner burr setting unless it’s an older machine - but to achieve the ideal dialled shot, I didn’t see another option . Anyway..

Like 1 of 2 enemies is fine but 3 enemies at once can get over whelming, especially when u can die from 4 hits, don't regen until you get some coffee and those coffee machines can be far at times and not near u at all. Ntm I believe they are limited and you only have a certain amount of them on the map. Atleast I don't think they refill?

Now another issue why the amount of enemies that can appear is that they can drain your stamina a lot and again like the coffee machine, there can be no soup machine for miles in your location and bendy might be blocking your only way out.

Just requesting to the devs to please lessen the amount of enemies that can spawn.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **MMA Showdown: Karine Silva vs. Dione Barbosa – A Clash of Coffee Brands and Circus Acts**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare your mouthguards and grab a seat—this week’s MMA matchup between **Karine Silva** and **Dione Barbosa** is brewing up more buzz than a pre-game energy drink. Let’s break down the odds, news, and why Silva is about to make Barbosa wish she’d brought a white flag to the octagon.

---

### Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem

The numbers don’t lie, and they’re currently wearing a tuxedo and monologuing about how **Karine Silva is the undisputed favorite** here. Her implied probability of winning? A staggering \~66.6% (thanks to decimal odds of 1.5). Meanwhile, Barbosa’s chances hover around 37-38%, which is about the same chance I have of understanding why anyone roots for the underdog in a fight named after a Brazilian jiu-jitsu legend.

The totals market? A 2.5-round line that favors the **Over** at 1.43 odds (\~69% implied probability). That suggests bookmakers expect this to go the distance—or at least avoid a first-round knockout. Silva’s spread of -3.5 points (DraftKings) implies she’ll win decisively, while Barbosa’s +3.5 line is as optimistic as betting your lunch money on a magic show.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Circus Acts, and a Side of Drama

Now, let’s spice up the pre-fight chatter with some *fabricated but plausible* headlines:

* **Silva’s camp** has been so disciplined, they’ve banned post-workout smoothie breaks to save calories. Her coach, a former math teacher, reportedly shouts, “Pi is 3.14, and so is your chance of beating me!” during sparring sessions.
* **Barbosa**, meanwhile, trained in a jungle survival camp where she learned to fight venomous snakes and avoid eati

He's been quiet since. No texts, no break room coffee chats, not lunch, nothing. I'm giving him space and being quiet as well. I have a life to live too.

I'm good with either, but I'm overthinking at this point and I need perspective. Thanks.",1,1755373582.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False
1ms5kyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1ms5kyy/should_you_buy_the_akeva_cord_organizer_for/,Should You Buy the Akeva Cord Organizer for Kitchen Appliances? Read This Review First!,"It’s hard to believe how much a small gadget like the Akeva Cord-black4 Cord Organizer for Kitchen Appliances can change your life, but here we are. As someone with an ever-growing collection of kitchen appliances, from my trusty Instant Pot to a sleek Kitchenaid stand mixer, cords cluttering my countertops always felt inevitable. That was until I gave this organizer a try. The promise of ending my countertop chaos combined with the compact and thoughtful design was too intriguing to pass up.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Crafted with food-grade silicone, the build quality took me by surprise. The material is incredibly soft yet impressively durable, which made attaching it to different appliance surfaces a breeze. Thanks to its flexibility, the cord organizer managed to stick snugly onto both flat and curved surfaces, showcasing how well-thought-out its design truly is. Its modern Black color blends well into any kitchen style, so even if it’s on display, it doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb.

**Ease of Installation**  
Installing this organizer might be the simplest task I’ve tackled in months. After cleaning the appliance surface with a cloth, it took no more than a minute to press this sticky wonder into place. The adhesive—standard 3M tape—grips the surface securely without budging, and I didn’t have to hold my breath waiting for it to fall. Plus, removing it when needed left no marks or damage on my blender. Small wins like that are what I truly appreciate when dealing with kitchen accessories.

**Performance in Tackling Appliance Cords**  
Beyond the aesthetics, this little tool proved to be a marvel in performance. The extra space it offers held even the thicker cords from my air fryer, which have been problematic with other organizers in the past. It keeps everything neatly bundled and almost disappears into the background once installed. My coffee maker cord, typically an unruly mess, is now manageable thanks to this device. Unlike other organizers that rely on flimsy material for holding cables, this one feels built to last.

**Compatibility Across Various Appliances**  
One of my favorite aspects of this cord keeper is its compatibility. I’ve tested it on glass, ceramic, wooden, and even curved metal surfaces around my kitchen, and it consistently stayed put. Whether on my Kitchenaid mixer, pressure cooker, or air fryer, it proved instantly functional and hassle-free to use. Moreover, the organizer has high resistance to both heat and cold, which boosted my confidence while attaching it to appliances that heat up during use.

**Highlights**  
- High-quality food-grade silicone ensures resistance to extreme temperatures.  
- Super easy installation process—takes less than a minute.  
- Versatile compatibility across glass, metal, and even leather surfaces.  
- Sleek and modern Black design adds aesthetic value.  

**Caveats**  
- Adhesive gets weaker on textured or very uneven surfaces like wicker or heavily grooved plastic.  
- Four organizers in a pack may not feel enough for users with a large kitchen appliance collection.  
- Though durable, cords may need adjustment occasionally for the perfect fit.  

**Product Alternatives**  
Researching alternatives led me to organizers like the Moforoco Cord Organizer and other generic brands. While some competitors offer a slightly lower price and similar adhesive strength, they often fall short in material quality and compatibility. For instance, a few rival products lack the flexibility to contour onto curved appliances, a feature Akeva perfected with its product. If you’re juggling between options, consider what surface types and cord sizes you’ll need to manage. Akeva edges out these brands if you want reliability and versatility combined.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Given its modest price point, the organizer packs a punch in terms of longevity and functionality. While some might argue it’s possible to DIY a similar solution, none would last as long or look this clean on appliances. This feels like a true “affordable quality” item, especially when compared to high-end wire-management tools. For the money, you’re getting a product that’s both practical and long-lasting—a rare combination in kitchen accessories.

We have this somewhat arrogant and obnoxious Indian international student in our class. He's very intense and cutthroat, and to his credit, he landed an MBB internship. He knows how to dial it down in the short term for coffee chats, behavioral interviews, and networking. 

However, became persona non grata in our MBA program after it came out that he does $0 when eating out. He got caught during a class dinner - he wanted to pay for the bill to get points on his card, and did a $0 tip. He screenshotted the bill with the $0 tip and sent it out to a WhatsApp group to Venmo the other students. 

This got spread across the campus and people started calling him an asshole, etc. Apparently he said at first he wasn't aware that tipping was ""mandatory"" in American culture as it's always optional in India (and in Europe and East Asia where he's traveled before). But this is one of the most basic things to know about America...how could he have not Googled or known this before? The US doesn't pay workers enough to live on without tips. 

Regardless, instead of changing his ways, he's doubling down on not tipping and being very defensive. He doesn't think you should be forced to tip anything unless service was exceptional. And that if other people act like him, it'll force the US to be more like Europe or Asia where they just increase prices but eliminate tipping lol.

Anyway everyone hates him now. Thanks to him some waiters and waitresses are really struggling.",0,1755373306.0,MBA,12,0.35,False

0:00I saw it with my own eyes. Millions disappeared and I was left behind. My0:05name is Raman Mens. I'm Dominican. I'm 54 years old and I've lived my entire0:11life at the Herrera Cafe in Western Sto. Domingo. If you're listening to me now,0:16I want you to know that this isn't a madeup story. It's a warning, a real testimony that has burned in my heart0:22since the day I found myself left behind. That day I understood that not0:27all who call themselves Christians are truly Christians. I was one of them. It all started one morning. Or at least0:34that's what I thought. I climbed the mountain as I had done so many times. I0:40wanted to be alone with God to pray, maybe to ask him for a word. I always0:45liked that place, the silence, the chirping of the crickets, the fresh breeze that caressed the leaves and my0:51soul. I felt that there my connection with heaven was stronger. But that night0:57something was different. I knelt, closed my eyes, and began to pray. I didn't ask1:02for anything strange. Screams in the darkness. I spoke to God with humility.1:08Or at least that's what I thought. But after a few minutes, a supernatural stillness surrounded me. The whole1:14atmosphere changed. The mountain no longer felt like a mountain. The air became dense, as if time had stopped.1:22Then I heard a sound like a trumpet, but it wasn't coming from the earth. It was a heavenly roar that made me tremble. I1:29looked up at the sky, and what I saw took my breath away, an opening, as if the firmament were tearing open. It was1:36like a gigantic luminous door, and rays of light began to emerge from it. But1:41the most shocking thing wasn't that. What broke me was seeing people. Yes,1:46people ascending. They literally ascended to heaven as if an invisible force was snatching them away. Some were1:53familiar, others not. But they all ascended with a piece, with a glory on their faces that I had never seen1:59before. The rapture was taking place. And I I stood there. My feet didn't2:05move. I wasn't lifted up. An endless fall. No one called me. I just felt a2:10weight on my back as if gravity were getting stronger. I looked at my hands. I checked my body and even cried out,2:18""Lord, here I am."" But nothing happened. It was then that a voice, not audible,2:23but clear in my spirit, spoke to me. ""Why are you lying, Ramon?"" The question2:29pierced me like a knife. I didn't know what to say. I didn't expect that to2:34lie. Yes, I am a Christian. I go to church. I pray. I preach. I fast. But at2:41that moment, it was as if a screen lit up in front of me. Scenes from my life2:46began to play. They weren't big sins, or so I thought. They were small, harmless2:51lies, or so I had justified them. I remembered that time I called into work claiming to be sick just to stay home2:59resting. Or that time I exaggerated a testimony to make it more interesting. I3:04remembered when I told a brother I was praying for him and I hadn't. When I told my wife that the money hadn't3:10lasted me, hiding from her that I spent it on myself. When I evaded a truth,3:15because it wasn't the time to tell it, all those things came like a hammer to my conscience. There I understood3:21something. Heaven doesn't open for the religious, but for the clean. Heart fire3:26everywhere, and I had stains I ignored for years. I couldn't speak. I just cried. I screamed again, ""Lord, forgive3:34me. Don't leave me."" But all I heard was the echo of my own voice while others3:39climbed. I remained firmly on the ground, paralyzed by the weight of my own excuses. I looked to my left and saw3:46a sister from the church, one of those who never preached, who sat quietly, but there she was ascending. I saw a young3:54man from the neighborhood, recently converted, with tattoos still visible, but with his face full of joy. He was4:01ascending like lightning and I, a Christian for years, was becoming less of a Christian. Then something inside me4:08broke. I collapsed on the ground. I felt fire on my back, an indescribable4:14anguish. And there, with eyes full of tears. I understood that a lie is not4:19just a false word. It is a betrayal of the spirit. It is a denial of the truth we claim to preach. But everything went4:26dark for a moment. The people stopped ascending. The sky closed and then chaos4:31began on Earth. I saw three people there. When the sky closed, I felt an4:36emptiness I had never experienced before. It was as if the soul itself had been torn from its hope. Those who4:43ascended were no longer there. The air felt thicker. The atmosphere heavier. Everything was spiritual darkness. I4:50didn't quite understand what was coming next. But something inside me knew the worst was just beginning. I stood up4:57with effort as if an invisible burden were pressing on my chest. I began to walk through the mountains, but it was5:04no longer the same. That place that had so often filled me with peace now seemed like a dry, gloomy field, as if5:11something holy had gone forever. And in that painful silence, another scene came to my mind like an internal vision. I5:18saw myself sitting on a bench in Herrera Park, and next to me was she. She was a5:23woman I had met years ago. Nothing out of the ordinary. A conversation that began with God bless you. Then turned5:30into a cup of coffee. Then a don't tell anyone. And finally a sin that sealed part of my condemnation. There never5:38was. I said full intimate relationships. We never reached the end. The pain5:44didn't stop. But the word is clear. He who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her5:50in his heart. And I didn't just look. I fed him. I hid that emotional and spiritual adultery for years. I5:57continued preaching, praying, fasting, justifying myself by saying it was just6:03a friendship. We all have struggles. But that night on that mountain with heaven closed and hell beginning to loom. I6:10understood that it's not about what men see, but what God knows of the heart. I remembered when I got home after those6:17encounters, hugging my wife with guilt in my chest. She trusted me, prayed with6:22me, and I carried a hidden dagger in my soul, she never found out. And even so,6:28I was judged because before the throne of God, there are no secrets. There are no excuses, no ulterior motives that go6:35unnoticed. Then I began to hear screams in the distance, cries of desperation,6:40people running through the streets, the sound of cars crashing, voices asking where my children are. Here, my husband6:48disappeared. They left me behind. The world was panicking. I staggered down the mountain, wanting to run, but my6:55legs barely responded. I recognized a familiar face on every corner. I saw7:00distraught faces, some looking at me as if I had answers. You know what's happening. They asked me what I was7:06going to tell them. That the rapture had happened and that I myself was left behind. That all my religiosity was a7:13facade. I saw a young man lying on the ground crying. I knew him from the neighborhood. We had evangelized him7:20once. And he never wanted to know about God. Now he was pulling his hair out,7:25screaming. It was true. It was true. His crying was an echo of my internal condemnation because I did know. And yet7:32I still lived in duplicity. I continued walking, feeling that everything around7:38me was a living judgment. The streets were filled with chaos. And in the midst of that disaster, another scene struck7:45me. the church altar. Me standing there with the Bible in my hand while hiding7:50sin in my heart. How many times I preached about holiness while committing adultery with my thoughts that broke me.7:57It broke me more than the screams because I understood that I was a traitor. Not to my wife, not to my8:03church. I failed Christ, the one who died for me. Why am I here? I sat on a8:09dusty sidewalk staring into space. Everything was confusing. And at that8:14moment, a new inner voice whispered to me, ""Your work will be tested by fire.""8:19I cried hard, not out of fear, but out of shame. I knew I had the Bible. I had8:25the spirit. I had opportunities, but I thought I was too strong, too wise. And8:30I fell into the same deception I preached that others should avoid. I saw a child running by, screaming his8:37mother's name. No one responded. He was an orphan of the rapture like many others because the heavens opened and8:44those who weren't prepared simply stayed. The streets of Herrera's cafe were no longer the same. Everything was8:50upside down. Screaming, confusion, desperation. But what hurt the most was8:56the silence from heaven. No matter how much I screamed, heaven didn't respond. I felt like Esau crying out with tears9:04for an opportunity that would never return. As I walked through the chaos, every step I took was a step toward my9:10shame. And then another bloke came to my memory. This time, far back in time,9:16years before I married in my youth, a voice spoke from the fire. I believed that was already forgotten, erased by9:23time and custom. But God's judgment has no amir. What is not confessed is9:29condemnation. I remembered that stage of my life when I fornicated without remorse. I said I was young, that9:36everyone did it, that later I would get married and everything would be left behind. I had several relationships9:43outside of marriage, some brief, others more intense. But in all of them, my9:48body surrendered while my soul sank. The most painful thing was seeing how even9:53after meeting Christ. I never treated the subject seriously, I was converted.9:59I gave up sexual relations outside of marriage, yes, but I never confronted10:04the spirit of immorality that had governed me. I never went to the altar with tears to ask for true deliverance.10:10I only buried it like someone who hides a corpse underground and hopes no one10:16discovers it. But in that moment, after the rapture, I understood that God is not deceived. What man buries, judgment10:24resurrects. I saw myself in my youth laughing with friends, telling stories of conquests, believing it was something10:31normal. Then I saw myself in church worshiping with raised hands the same hands that touched the forbidden. And I10:38felt disgusted with myself. The clock of judgment. Don't get me wrong. I know God's grace is powerful, but grace is no10:46excuse to keep quiet about sins. Grace doesn't cover what isn't confessed. and10:51I never did. I became a leader in the church. I got married. I became a father, but I never looked back at that10:58dark corner of my past until I was left behind. The mountain was behind me. Now11:04I was walking down San Juan Street. I saw two women lying on the ground hugging each other, crying. I recognized11:11one of them. She congregated with us, always helpful. She sang in the choir. I11:17approached her and said, ""Sister, you stayed too."" She looked at me with tearful eyes and only said, ""I thought11:24the Lord would take me."" We looked at each other in silence, without judgment, only with pain. She didn't have to tell11:31me her sin. I didn't have to explain mine to her. We both knew we lacked sincerity before God. Then I sat on a11:38dirty sidewalk next to a closed hardware store. The world was in chaos, but inside me, what was grumbling was deeper11:45than any catastrophe. It was my own image. The man of God I believed myself to be was just a facade. They cried out11:52for water. I felt something crushing my chest. I couldn't breathe, an invisible11:58burden, as if God himself were letting me feel the weight of every hidden act. I heard a phrase deep in my soul. Filth12:05does not enter my kingdom, even if it dresses in religion. That broke me. I remembered when as a youth leader I12:12advised others to live in holiness while I myself dragged chains I never dared to12:17cut. I didn't see them. I didn't feel them until now. I began to see others from the neighborhood. Good honest12:24people. Some who even preached. They all had one thing in common. They were left behind. Some were crying. Others beat12:32their chests. But most were in shock. No one talked about money. No one thought about work. Everything was anguish,12:39questions, guilt. The world had changed in the blink of an eye. The sin we thought was small left us on earth.12:46Fornication was not only a sin of the past. It was a door I never closed. A wound I left untouched. Heal a shadow12:54that continued to look. Even though I disguised myself as light, eternal torment is real. At that moment, I knew13:01that if the Lord ever allowed me to tell this story, I would do it with my soul naked and unfiltered because the time13:08for pretense is over. If this story speaks to your heart, subscribe now,13:13like, leave your comment, and share this testimony with others. Many still have13:19time, but it won't be like this forever. I kept walking aimlessly with empty eyes13:24and a broken heart. The streets of Herrera Cafe were a collective lament. People lying confused, crying. It looked13:32like a war zone, but there were no bombs or bullets, only broken hearts and souls13:37on the brink of judgment. Every corner reminded me that there was no turning back. I stopped in front of a house13:44where an older sister lived, a woman who always seemed to me to be too simple. She didn't know much about the Bible.13:51She barely spoke. She sat at the back of the temple with her headscarf on, worshiing with her eyes closed. I saw13:58her pray many times, but I never took her seriously. I thought she was an ordinary believer. I thought I was14:04deeper, more experienced, more used by God, the final warning. But in that14:09moment, seeing her house empty with no trace of her, I knew the truth, she was taken away, and I was left feeling like14:16a wall was falling on me. how many times I underestimated her. I even came to think I was religious because I wore14:23long skirts and didn't talk much with my Bible studies, my sermons with Greek and14:28Hebrew quotations, my experience in retreats and campaigns. I felt higher.14:33But that woman, that silent sister was found worthy. It was there standing in14:38front of that humble house that I understood what had truly condemned me. Pride. Pride blinded me. Made me believe14:45I was fine. Made me think God gave me the size I was that he weighed me according to applause. Invitations to14:52preach. The praise of the congregation. I confused human recognition with divine14:57approval. I remembered how I looked down on new believers. How I corrected others with an attitude of superiority as if I15:05had all the answers. I believed myself a pillar of the church, but I was just a modern-day Pharisee disguised as a15:11leader, full of the Bible, but devoid of humility. What Jesus told me as the world collapsed around me, I felt I15:18finally saw clearly. I saw myself as he truly was a man full of himself with a heart that could not be lifted up15:25because he already believed himself to be on high. I looked up at the sky for a moment. I don't know why. There was no15:32more light, no more trumpets, only a thick cloud and a painful silence. But inside me, a voice was telling me,15:39""Ramon, what good did it do to you to know so much if you didn't know how to love? What good did it do to you to15:46speak beautifully? If you despised the little ones, I fell to my knees in the15:51middle of the street. I didn't care if they saw me. There was no more dignity, only shame."" I grabbed my head and cried15:58like a child. Because that pride not only separated me from God. It separated me from grace. It robbed me of my16:05simplicity. It made me deaf to the warnings of other brothers who once tried to correct me but whom I ignored16:11because I considered them less spiritual. I thought of Jesus in his meekness. How he washed his disciples16:17feet. I had never done anything like that. On the contrary, I liked being served, being recognized, being invited16:24as a man of God. But now the threshold of a sinking land. Are you ready for heaven? In the darkness, all of that was16:31garbage. I was garbage. I saw a group of young people from the neighborhood gathered on a corner. Some were crying.16:38Others were nervously mocking them as if they still didn't believe what had just happened. I approached, hoping to talk16:45to them, to warn them. But one of them looked at me and said something I'll never forget. If you're a Christian and16:52you stayed, I said, ""What hope do we have?"" I didn't know how to respond. Pride not only condemned me, it16:59condemned others through me. Because by showing myself as a self-sufficient believer, it hardened many who needed to17:06see humility, not perfection. If I had been more truthful, more transparent.17:11Perhaps they wouldn't be on that corner today. I walked back, head down. With each step, I felt the judgment sinking17:18deeper into my back. I thought I had hit rock bottom, but not the worst. The17:23chaos hadn't even begun yet. It had come to the world. But I still hadn't fully17:28understood that what was happening was the rapture. The news continued to broadcast images of accidents. Repent17:35now. Of desperate crowds from panicked cities. But something inside me screamed, ""This isn't normal. This is17:42biblical."" I walked aimlessly through the dusty streets of Herrera, trying to find someone who could give me an17:49explanation. I yelled my wife's and my daughter's names, and no one answered.17:54The neighborhood church was open but empty. The pews were in disarray, Bibles17:59scattered on the floor, and a strong smell of incense mixed with dried tears. That's where I saw him. A young man who18:06used to preach at traffic lights was kneeling in front of the altar, crying. His hands were covered in blood. I18:13approached, touched him on the shoulder, and he said with eyes full of despair, ""We'll stay, brother. We'll stay."" I18:21froze. He spoke to me as if he understood something I didn't want to accept, and he repeated it more18:27forcefully. Christ came and we stayed. The sound of those words pierced my18:32soul. I felt the blood rush to my feet. Everything I had heard in old sermons, at prayer vigils, in campaigns, and18:40revival services, words I will not forget. Everything was real. Everything18:45came true, and I didn't believe it. Or worse yet, I ignored it. Outside, people18:51were running like crazy. Some committed suicide by throwing themselves off bridges and buildings. Others banged on18:58church doors, looking for a second chance that would never come. The young man at the altar told me that his mother19:04had disappeared while praying in the room. He searched the entire house for her, but only found her Bible open to19:10Psalm 27, and her clothes folded on the bed. She cried and screamed, but it was19:16too late. I left the church like a living dead man. I walked to my old house, and that's when I realized my19:23wife's clothes were still on the bed. Her phone was still ringing. I had dozens of unspoken voicemails, but she19:30wasn't there. My daughters weren't there either. All their things were intact as if they had simply evaporated. And then19:37I understood. They went with the Lord and I was left behind. I wanted to pray,19:42but my voice wouldn't come out. I wanted to ask for forgiveness, but I didn't feel his presence, an urgent call. It19:50was as if heaven were closed. As if my soul were sealed. I remembered all the times the Holy Spirit spoke to me. the19:57times God called me to consecrate myself and I I put it off afterwards I would say when I have time but that lat no20:05longer existed the sky was now made of bronze and it was there lying on the floor of my living room crying like a20:12lost child I understood the worst the Holy Spirit was no longer the grace had ended time had been fulfilled and what20:19was coming now was darkness persecution and judgment if this testimony is20:24revealing something to you support me by liking it, commenting what you think. Share it with someone else. And don't20:31forget to subscribe. What you're hearing is real. Still stunned by the absence of my family and the silence of heaven. I20:38began to clearly see another sin that bound me and that I had never wanted to acknowledge hypocrisy. That mask I wore20:45for years to appear a man of faith when inside I was full of contradictions. I remembered the times I stood in the20:51pulpit to speak of holiness, of repentance, of true love, while secretly judging those who fought their own20:57battles. When I smiled for the photo, but my thoughts were full of resentment when I preached that the church should21:04be pure. But I myself had a heart stained with selfishness and falsehood, that hypocrisy had isolated me,21:11separated me from God and the people who loved me. It was like walking with invisible chains, believing that no one21:18could see them, but God did see them. And that rapturous night revealed the depth of my deception. I went out into21:25the street and saw several brothers in the nearby church. Some were crying, others were in absolute silence. An old21:32man whom I admired for his faith and humility looked at me and said with a broken voice, ""Ramon, the truth hurts,21:39but it's the only one that can save us."" I felt the weight of my lies crushing me. Not only the words, but the actions21:46I hid behind them. And I understood that hypocrisy is not just a lie, but a refusal to live in the truth. It was21:53then that I heard that once again, in a voice, he who is faithful in little will be faithful in much. But you have been22:00faithful. I fell to my knees in the midst of chaos. It didn't matter that the world was falling apart. The only22:08thing that mattered was repenting and seeking the truth. Even though it was too late for me, I stood there in front22:14of that small fruit shop, watching the old woman count her money with trembling hands. The image was simple everyday,22:22but for me it became a brutal mirror. In that instant, my heart broke violently.22:27How many times had I, who claimed to be a man of God, refused to help people22:32like her? How many times had I seen the need of others and closed myself off,22:38clinging to money, justifying that I couldn't give more. That question burned me inside. It wasn't the greed of a22:45thief or the shameless covetousness of a powerful rich man, but that silent and persistent desire that dwells in the22:52hearts of many. The greed that disguises itself as prudence. The responsibility22:57of having to take care of what's mine. That same thing that made me put aside faith to putting all my trust in work in23:04money in the plans I wo with my own hands. I clearly remember those years when money began to be my priority. when23:12prayer hours became overtime hours at work. When church meetings were just another space in my busy schedule, when23:19priorities changed, and I, without realizing it, began putting money above23:24God and my family. I was an active believer. Yes, I helped at church when I23:29could, but always with a calculator in hand. I counted expenses, measured how23:35much I could give and how much I should set aside for myself. I convinced myself with the excuse that I had to provide23:41for my house and that money didn't grow on trees. But deep down, what I was cultivating was a hardened heart and a23:48weak faith. I remember one particular occasion that marked me forever. It was at a church meeting where help was23:55requested for a brother who was experiencing financial difficulties. The need was urgent, and the pastor made a24:01call for generosity. While the brothers opened their pockets and hearts, I felt a lump in my throat as I looked at my24:08eye looked in my wallet and saw a summer that was important to me. I felt pressure to give, but my inner voice24:14whispered, ""You need it more."" That night, I went to bed with the money in my pocket. But with an empty soul, I24:21couldn't sleep. Guilt invaded me. But greed paralyzed me. I thought about the24:26expenses, the projects I had, and the uncertain future. And so day after day,24:32I hardened my heart until I no longer felt the call to help, to share, to live24:38generously. That silent greed robbed me of my peace, filled me with anxiety and24:43constant worry, and distanced me from the true freedom that only God can give. Meanwhile, in the streets, people24:50suffered while I calculated. They cried out, returning to that scene on the mountain. I saw with pain how my spirit24:57had been trapped by that subtle greed. I saw moments when I could have extended my hand, but I didn't. I saw the faces25:04of brothers and neighbors, strangers who passed through my life asking for help and received excuses. But not only that,25:12I also saw how my greed affected my family, my wife, who always she dreamed of a home full of love and peace. She25:19suffered in silence. my lack of generosity, my children, who needed my time and presence, were relegated to a25:26secondary role behind my plans for work and savings, and I, blinded by the25:32desire to possess, lost the most valuable thing. I felt a deep pain, a shame oppressed my chest. I knew that my25:39greed had closed doors that would never open for me in heaven. The Bible says that the love of money is the root of25:45all evil. I had fallen into that route, and now I was paying the price. As I walked through the neighborhood, I saw25:52the empty street, the silence broken only by the wind and the dry weather of a world that had changed forever, I25:59thought of all the plans I made without God. Of all the times I preferred money over prayer, offering over giving,26:05selfishness over generosity. And then I understood that true wealth is not in what you have, but in what you give with26:12love. That God doesn't look at the amount, but at the intention that greed not only steals the blessing, but also26:18salvation. I fell to my knees, feeling the heavy burden of my sins. I prayed. I26:23cried. I begged for mercy. Even though I knew it was too late for me, but I hoped that at least my testimony would serve26:30so that others wouldn't make the same mistakes as me. It's hard for me to write this part because while I do, my26:36hands are shaking. It's as if I'm reliving everything second by second, as if the images had been tattooed on my26:43mind. I didn't want to accept it. But the truth is that in that dream or vision, I don't know. They left me26:49behind. Yes, I stayed. Not for lack of biblical knowledge, not for lack of opportunities, I stayed because my heart26:56was lukewarm. Because my faith was of lips, not of life, because I hid behind27:02the God understands me message while I continued justifying my sin. It all27:07began with an intense light. It was like a flash of lightning that suddenly crossed the sky. I felt a thunderous27:13roar that shook the air, the trees, the earth. It was something that shook my insides. I looked up at the sky and saw27:21an explosion of glory. I don't know how to explain it. It was as if the heavens27:26themselves had opened and an invisible glorious force had begun to bring millions of people. I saw them ascend. I27:34saw bodies transform, garments shine, children disappear from their mother's27:39arms, elders were lifted from their beds. Young people with tears in their eyes were swept away with joy. I saw the27:46crowd spiring upward, enveloped in a light as white as the sun, but not burning. It was beautiful and terrifying27:53at the same time, because at the same moment I stood still, waiting, and27:58nothing happened. And I said it out loud, and then I knew I didn't need anyone to tell me. I had been left28:04feeling an emptiness so deep, so painful that it's impossible to put into words. It was as if my soul suddenly knew there28:11was no chance that mercy had closed its door. I ran outside, screaming, looking28:17for someone who could explain to me, that it was all a mistake. But I couldn't find anyone who could calm my28:23anguish. What I saw in the street was even more terrifying. There was chaos everywhere. People crying, beating their28:30chests, asking for their children, for their husbands, for their mothers. I saw28:35churches open with empty pews and others full with pastors crying because they had also been left behind. I heard a28:42woman kneeling and screaming, ""Forgive me, Lord."" I knew I knew her cry made my28:47blood run cold because it wasn't remorse. It was desperation. It was at that moment that I understood28:54everything. I didn't lack preaching. I didn't lack transformation. I didn't lack the Bible. I didn't lack obedience.29:00I didn't lack prayer. I didn't lack sincere repentance. You know, the most painful thing is that inside me, even at29:07that moment, I tried to justify myself. I thought, well, if I try harder from29:13now on, maybe I'll have a second chance. But immediately, a loud voice. I don't29:18know if it was the voice of the spirit or my own conscience. Waking up, it shouted, ""It's too late."" That phrase29:26fell like a hammer on my chest. It's too late. I ran to the house of a friend who29:31truly knew the Lord. When I arrived, I found it empty. Her clothes were on the29:36bed, her Bible open, and next to it, a note that said, ""Jesus, I am waiting for29:41you with joy. I am ready."" She did leave, and I stayed. I fell to my knees29:47and cried, but there was no more. Nothing I could do. The news kept talking about the unexplained global29:54event. They said billions of people had disappeared. Some spoke of an alien evacuation, others of a transition to30:01another dimension. But deep down, everyone knew. What broke my heart the most was hearing religious leaders and30:07supposedly great pastors say on television that this isn't the rapture. Don't worry, everything has a scientific30:14explanation, a life from the devil, they stayed, too. And now they wanted to drag30:19others down with them. That night, I tried to sleep but couldn't. My eyes were dry from crying so much. I felt a30:27constant pressure in my chest, as if I was short of breath. I remembered every time God spoke to me. Every message I30:35ignored, every altar I scorned, every time I put business above my communion with him, how many excuses I used to30:42justify my indifference. I thought about my phone full of social media meme30:47videos, but empty of the word. I thought about my time, how much time I gave to30:52God compared to my TV shows, my social media, my money, my pleasures. I felt30:58dirty, a hypocrite, and too late. I saw how in the following days the earth31:03began to change. The social order was collapsing. It wasn't just sadness. It was unleashed evil without the Holy31:10Spirit holding back evil. Hearts were now showing their true nature. Violent groups were rising up. People killing31:17for food. Governments passing increasingly perverse laws. The true churches had disappeared. And what31:23remained was a vain shell. One morning I heard a broken voice on the radio. It was a young man crying. He said, ""If31:31you're listening to this and you stayed, too. Don't join the system. They're going to impose a mark. If you put it31:37on, it will be your eternal end. Repent while you can. Even if it costs your31:42life."" I turned off the radio. I couldn't stand it anymore. I knelt down and said, ""Lord, I know it's late, but31:50if you can still hear me, here I am."" and all I felt was silence. This testimony is not to scare you, but to31:57open your eyes. I don't want the same thing to happen to you. I don't want you to live trusting in an empty religion or32:04in a half-hearted faith. If you're still here, it's because Christ hasn't come yet, and you still have time to repent,32:12truly seek him, live in holiness, and don't play with your salvation. The gospel is not just another option. It's32:19the only truth that saves the day. And before continuing, if this message is touching you, subscribe now to this32:26channel so you don't miss the next episodes of this full testimony. Activate the bell below. Let's talk32:33about what you think and share this video with someone who needs to hear it. Do it today because tomorrow could be32:39too late. That night, I slept little. The image of the child with the Bible haunted me. I went to bed, but my mind32:47wouldn't rest. I kept wondering, who is that child? How can he have so much32:52faith, so much certainty when with everything I own, I'm empty? Around 3:0032:57in the morning, I got up, dressed quietly, and went out for a walk. It was33:03as if something was pushing me toward the square, toward the place where I had seen the child. I wanted to talk to him.33:10I needed to understand why his words had shaken me so deeply. When I arrived, a33:15night breeze blew strongly. The trees whispered secrets in the darkness, and33:20the city slept, but he wasn't there. The bench where I first saw him was empty.33:25However, on the bench was a folded piece of paper. I picked it up carefully. It33:31was a sheet torn from a school notebook in crooked letters written in pencil. It33:36said, ""God doesn't need you to understand everything. He just wants you to trust him sometimes. The miracle33:43begins when you stop asking why and start saying, ""Here I am, Lord.""33:48Jeremiah 29 hours 11 minutes. I sat on that same bench, holding the note as if33:54it were a treasure. I never imagined that such a simple phrase written by a beggar child would leave me with tears34:00in my eyes. I returned home, but something had changed. I no longer had34:05the same desire to control everything. For the first time in many years, I felt34:10inclined to pray. I closed my bedroom door. I turned off the lights, knelt at34:15the edge of the bed, and without elegant phrases, without theology or formulas, I34:20spoke to God like a lost child. God, I don't know if you still hear me. I don't34:26know if you still want something from me after all I've done. But if that child is your messenger, if you still give me34:33a chance, here I am. Do what you have to do. I didn't feel any lightning. I34:38didn't hear any voices, but something happened inside me. Peace. A peace I34:43hadn't felt since my

1ms5gnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/cavite/comments/1ms5gnv/cafe_recommendations_around_gentri/,cafe recommendations around gentri,"Hii, my family loves coffee kaya every Sunday after attending mass, isa sa bomding namin ang magcafe visit. Any recommendations around GenTri area? 

So far, we've tried
- **Blk&Brwn**; coffee and food tastes great tapos the price is very reasonable pa. Fav so far ay yung signature coffee nila which is a mix of espresso and tea, 70% sweetness. My sister tried their Irish Coffee and it really has alcohol to it , unlike other cafes na they advertise it as just a creamy coffee. It's good, talagang nandun lang yung aftertaste of the alcohol. Fav so far for the food is the pork gochujang, but tasted all of them na ang they all are masarap and very affordable. Their tiramisu is okay na for its price, kung very legit hanap mo, 'wag ka na lang dito. Their cookies are okay lang din.
- **Java Junction**; it's a no for us :(( Matcha tastes like those you could drink in other cafes, not ceremonial, sweet, and very milky. Coffee is mid. I bet they use the same commercial matcha as other cafes.
- **Felize Cafe**; super not a fan sorry huhu. The drinks taste too sweet. We've tried all their iced coffees, some refreshers, and matcha drinks—and they all tasted sweet. I actually tried ordering a shot of espresso kasi sobrang tamis nung drinks so I opted on bringing an oat milk, and pouring the espresso there (sorry that may seem disrespectful pero lahat kasi nung inorder namin that time was too sweet tapos I am lactose intolerant pa and they don't have other milk options 😭 won't do it again). Sakura-Matcha is also too sweet to the point na I asked for it to be less sweet  na, drank 1/3 of it, fill it with water, drank the 1/3 of it again, and asked for more ice, and it still taste sweet. I went home na with the drink and mind you, hindi na siya malamig at lahat-lahat, matamis pa rin 😭 Although their matcha frappe is saktong sweetness lang, but they also use the basic commercial matcha.Fav drink na siguro ay yung Cold Foam Americano nila, no other sweetener. The foods are good tho, siguro naging factor na the owner (?) I think is the same one ng owner ni Lawiswis (resto behind the cafe) na masarap foods. The egg pie and cake we ordered ay lasang tinapay, like as in dry na tinapay and IDK why 😭 Kaya after that, we never ordered pastries again from them kasi ang mahal pero the taste is not giving. Reco for their food are burger, sardines aglio olio, pizzas, salad, and pesto sandwich.
- **Episode One**; Our first order here was through Grab wherein they offer 2 drinks for 295. Lemon-Americano and a drink na something with cinnamon yung fav namin but they removed na yung cinnamon drink sa menu nila huhu. Recently, natry na namin yung americano with vanilla cold foam and it tastes good. The matcha naman tastes earthy and somehow grassy with little rough texture to it. Similar siya sa taste ng isang matcha brand na natry namin sa tiktok shop. I recommend ube-matcha sub oat and 50% sweetness or their strawberry-matcha, less sweet din. Their pure matcha, on the other hand, is just matcha and milk. I tried putting homemade early grey syrup to it tapos masarap. Hope they can put it on their menu. The staff are so friendly and mabilis kumilos kahit na super daming tao nung dumating kami.
- **Brainstorms&Brew by &Coffee**; Okay naman pero mas better yung taste ng drinks when they first opened. Their hojicha taste promising pero depende sa barista kasi yung timpla 😭 Their cheesecake is good considering na it's not too pricey, their croissantwich is also good 'wag lang masyadong matoasted si croissant itself, banana bread is too dry. Their orange-espresso (dk the name) is good as well as theor biscoff drinks. Yung biscoff drinks nila as in biscoff talaga yung lasa. Their signature brainmylk latte is milky with a hint of cinnamon taste and the rest of their drinks lean on the milk side (or i think nakadepende lang sa barista).
- **Kura Cafe** The drinks are promising. So far, our favs are vitnamese coffee, yuzu lemon iced blended, toffee nut latte sub oat and less sweet, pesto sandwich, biscoff croissant, and onion rings. Actually, all of their food are decent, sulit naman. We went there several times na, including when they just opened. The serving, I think, becomes so long kapag may food na kasama kasi since nagkaron sila ng resto (near their restroom and behind sa pwesto nila), doon pa nanggagaling yung food tapos saka idedeliver sa cafe area kaya pabalik-balik sila ng place. I think the issue lies sa walang connection si cafe sa resto and so naeexpose pa si food sa outside world bago maideliver sa table niyo. 

Nagpapapalit-palit lang kami diyan kasi we-re looking for reviews sa mga underrated cafe ng magsasabi na their coffee is not sweet. Please recommend some cafes na around the area and worth to try🫶

1ms5gk1,https://i.redd.it/zdbikfsupfjf1.jpeg,Everywhere You,"It was an ordinary afternoon in Guwahati.
The streets were alive — the chatter of small shops, the honking of auto-rickshaws, and the golden sunlight spilling across the crowded road.

Kevin walked through it all, lost in his own thoughts.
For him, it was just another day.
Until he saw her.

Miss Mysterious.

She was walking ahead, sunlight gently touching her face.
There was something about the way she moved — calm, detached, as if she carried a world of her own.
No noise could touch her presence.
And for Kevin, in that one moment, the entire street faded away.

She turned her head, just for a second.
One fleeting glance.
That was all it took for Kevin’s heart to freeze in time.
He didn’t even know her name.
But in his mind, he called her —
Miss Mysterious.




From that day on, everything changed.

The smell of coffee reminded him of her.
The warmth of the afternoon sun carried her face with it.
Even a random laugh in the crowd echoed like hers.

Opening his laptop, a single blue cell on the screen flashed her scarf in his memory.
Walking down the street, every reflection, every shadow seemed to whisper her presence.

She was everywhere.




Kevin understood the psychology of it.
Selective Attention — the mind’s way of filtering the world to show you only what your heart is fixed upon.
Emotional Imprinting — when a single smile becomes so deeply etched in memory that it follows you, with eyes open or closed.

But for him, this wasn’t science.
It was a story.
His story.




One night, in his diary, Kevin wrote:

Perhaps Miss Mysterious will never know…
that a boy can love this deeply —
to see her in every sound, every color, every moment.

When we woke up in the morning, we discovered that most likely the previous guest had been doing drugs on the coffee table, as there were white powdery lines that look like had been moved around with a credit card, and a little pile of white powder. Would not be a big deal if it was just me and my wife, however we had our five month old with us who likes to put his hands on everything and then into his mouth. We discovered this the morning of our wedding, and we became quite concerned that he may have touched it, and it added a lot of stress to our wedding day. When we brought this up to the management they gas lit us saying it was microfibre cloth dust, however I took my pinky and gave it a little taste and  it was most definitely drugs. The hotel is yet to apologize and they are denying that this ever happened even though we have photos. After lots of back-and-forth, they agreed to comp us one night however, I feel like this is not sufficient as it really put a damper on our whole wedding as we were so concerned about our child. What do you think would be a fair compensation for a situation such as this.

Planning to go to the Far Territories for the first time ever and preferably close all possible achievements, including the Tales and 25 days in the mine. I am well settled and have pretty much everything (except snow pants due to unfortunate bear accident). I'm planning to spend at least 100 days in the new regions (except going back and forth for Signal Void). What should I bring with me?

My plan is:

\- Deliver supplies to Transfer Pass and split it per destination. Can I carry travois through the first area to Transfer Pass, or will it have to be multiple trips?

\- For Langston Mine: bring 100 caffeine pills, 10 Vitamin-C pills, 30 kg of cured meat, probably some 10kg of pemmican (which I've been zealously preparing in my CH and TWM bases), lamp oil (how much?), gather coal and water in advance, and bring a stim (or 20) because I can (sponsored by Big Pharma). Who needs birch bark tea?!

\- For Sundered Pass: I purchased 5 heat packs from Sutherland, I know the region is the coldest by far and plan to bring coal, thermos, plus coffee (and stims just to be safer) for the never-ending ropes, plus probably 100 revolver rounds, a new bow and a bunch of arrows for the warm welcoming committee. I'm debating whether to bring Armored Vest but have it ready in the Camp Office if I decide to, or is double insulation better? Anyway I'll bring all the accessories with me: satchel, crampons, insulation (maybe 2). The plan is to hop in, run through the Tale, escape as quickly as possible.

\- For Forsaken Airfield: I don't know really, I think it might have a feeling similar to (extremely un)Pleasant Valley, no special supplies except the usual travel pack.

\- ZOC and mine in general I'll be taking very cautiously, I don't want any risks with my main run. Respirator cans, detailed guides with all the toxic fumes, spray cans to mark my way through.

But I got sober in March, and since then, I've started chipping away at the debt I’ve built up. Still, I’m in a really tough place.

My credit is bad. I live with my dad and don’t pay rent. I work as a barista and I’ve been working out regularly—the only healthy habit I’ve stuck with in years. I've also managed to get a handle on my depression and ADHD, which is a step forward. But even with that progress, I feel so lost. Lonely. Useless.
I've been through multiple psych ward stays, rehab, and a decade of addiction. That’s left me with a mountain of debt and a lot of shame. I don’t really know how to manage money or function like a ""normal"" adult. I'm not using anymore—no more opiates after 10 years—but now I’m just standing here trying to figure out what life is supposed to look like without them.
Sometimes I wonder if it’s even worth continuing. But I’m asking for any advice idk if this is the right place to ask.

Is this remission or…","Hi all. Want to start off by saying that this sub has helped me so much. I wish I had found it years ago.

Quick history for context: 29F starting having UTIs when 16. Sole trigger is sex. Had them constant from 16 until 21. Was referred to two different urologists at the time. Couldn’t have sex with my then partner because a weekly dose of fosfomycine and a dose of nitro after intercourse wasn’t cutting it. At the time, I was studying in the U.K. in the largest uni for medicine. My mental health was deteriorating so bad, I asked my friends who were training in med school to give me their digital access to PubMed. 

I spent a week scanning PubMed to understand as much as I could about UTIs. Long story short I read a lot on D Mannose, ordered some from SweetCures (this isn’t sponsored. SweetCures was created by a Dr at Uni of Liverpool and her formulas were the best then). 

Never had a UTI again for 8 years. I thought it was too good to be true, sent the clinical studies to my two uro (they never replied). Got all my friends on D Mannose. 

My routine was: 1g of D Mannose before sex. Making sure bladder was on its way to be full before inter course. 2g after intercourse, peeing, quick shower. I can’t say my lifestyle made the difference: I smoked, drank coffee, alcohol, but I lost weight, worked out and healed my gut a lot.

Met someone early June, started having sex again end of the month. Didn’t pee after sex, rookie mistake I know… had more sex in the week, could feel that I was dry, didn’t put more lube, second rookie mistake. Had ran out of D Mannose, thought it’s been 8 years, I’d be fine. 3rd rookie mistake! Waited almost 6 days. I could feel a slight tingle but nothing unbearable. Ended in the ER from one hour to the other. I went to pee and all of sudden it was unbearable. Took 1 dose of fosfomycine I had left. Woke up two hours later to needing to pee again: only blood came out, pain was so bad I could barely walk, I thought I was dying. Mind you I am someone who doesn’t have paracetamol at my house on the daily. Ended in the ER, left with a prescription for Cipro. Took it for a week, no notable side effects. Symptoms persisted nonetheless: was prescribed 7 days of pivmicillan 2 weeks after even though nothing showed in culture. Made it better. 

Got tested for:
- had two ultrasounds on kidneys and bladder which showed absolutely nothing. Residue left after peeing is also great.
- mycoplasma all negatives, STIs all negatives 
- ureaplama is not testable in France, only if it shows up in culture 
- urine tests all came back with polymorph flora, possible contamination from vagina. Urine culture from the ER showed nothing but high leukocytes and nitrites. Doctor said because I took a dose of fosfomycine, it couldnt show up in culture.
- urologist said it’s most likely a relapse but I should be fine. Scheduled for a cystoscopy in September. Uroscanner scheduled for next week.

To today:
- still having mild symptoms, took a urine test, came back negative for everything expect high hematia. No leuko, no epithelial cells, culture shows to be sterile. Urine is cloudy, dark.

What are your guesses? Could this be hematia from my bladder being so inflammed due to antibiotics and the pain of the infection? All advice and help would be appreciated

1ms59aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ms59aj/discover_if_the_nostalgia_12cup_coffee_maker/,Discover if the Nostalgia 12-Cup Coffee Maker Lives Up to Reviews,"The **Nostalgia Nostalgia Coffee Maker**, specifically the **B0BFJVDRH9** model, caught my attention as a retro-inspired coffee machine that promises both style and performance. Being someone who takes their morning cup of coffee very seriously—I'm talking can't-function-without-it level serious—I decided to give this machine a spin. From its aesthetic charm to its features, there's plenty to talk about, both good and not-so-perfect.

**Retro Design That Stands Out**

I’ll admit, the design was what drew me in immediately. The bold red color and retro aesthetic make it a visual treat for any kitchen counter. The machine is compact yet substantial, measuring 10""×7.68""×14.21"", which fits easily into my average-sized kitchen without taking up too much space. Paired with its sturdy build, it feels like a decor piece that also happens to brew coffee. A conversation starter, if you will.

**Technology Meets Simplicity**

What excited me most about testing this coffee maker is the balance of modern functionality with its simple, old-school vibe. The programmable 24-hour clock is an actual lifesaver for my mornings. I set it up the night before, and when I shuffle into the kitchen bleary-eyed, there’s my coffee—freshly brewed and waiting. The LED display is backlit, which makes it really easy to use even in dim lights.

[Grab Nostalgia Nostalgia Coffee Maker at the best price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0bfjvdrh9/)

**Pause-And-Serve Feature**

The pause-and-serve function. My mornings tend to be rushed, and let's be honest, sometimes I can't even wait for the machine to finish brewing. With this feature, I could pour myself a cup mid-brew without spilling coffee everywhere. Practicality at its finest!

**Key Benefits**

- Retro-inspired design brings a unique flair to the kitchen.
- Programmable 24-hour clock simplifies brewing schedules.
- Pause-and-serve function is ideal for early birds on tight schedules.  
- Sturdy and compact build fits well even in smaller spaces.

**Areas of Improvement**

Not everything is flawless with this product, and it’s only fair to share a full picture:

- The carafe is lightweight but feels a bit fragile. I wouldn't recommend any accidental drops here.  
- While the coffee brews fairly quickly, the machine is a bit noisy during operation.  
- The included reusable filter is convenient but not as fine-mesh as I'd hoped, resulting in minor sediment in the coffee at times.

**Performance and Practicality**

One of the highlights of this coffee maker is its 12-cup capacity. I drank coffee through the morning, while my partner enjoyed refills—it held up like a trooper. It’s particularly well-suited for households where multiple people drink coffee or during gatherings. The automatic shut-off after two hours is another thoughtful touch. Frankly, it saved me from those panic moments after leaving the house.

**Market Rivals**

Compared to other drip coffee machines like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Nostalgia coffee maker wins on aesthetics. While the Cuisinart offers more advanced programming options and better brew strength control, it costs significantly more. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, on the other hand, includes single-serve compatibility, which this product lacks, but its design is uninspired. Nostalgia's uniqueness is where it truly shines, although it could integrate additional brew strength settings to keep up with its peers.

**Price Worthiness**

When evaluating this machine's affordability compared to other products, it delivers a fair deal. Its standout design and key features justify its price range. Is it the best-performing coffee maker out there? No, but if you're looking to combine charm with ease of use at a reasonable price, it’s certainly worth considering.

It's been a minute ... I, F59, just responded to another post and thought I'd post an update for those who may be/are interested to my [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty/comments/1ljeas3/date_8_update/) about dating my daughter's best friend's dad. We're still seeing each other and I have lost count of the dates. :) We'll hit the three-month mark next week, though.

The biggest challenge is that we're both very busy AND we're figuring out how to make time for each other. We're still having great conversations about pretty much everything (I'm actually reading a book on macroeconomics he recommended, in between all my regular reading), and he makes me laugh--and he makes me think.   
  
Our worlds collided a couple of days ago. He had spent the night (both my kids were already in bed by the time we went to bed) at my place one night and we were having coffee on my patio in the morning. A car pulls up, and I say, ""isn't that your daughter?"" Yup--arriving to pick up my daughter to get coffee together. Then the girls came back, hung out with us for a while, and made some TikToks. LOL! They both appear to be fine with the fact that we're dating and I'm thrilled about that. They want the four us to go to the driving range together so we're going to do that soon. 

I still don't know where our relationship will go. And I told him it's hard for me to not ""drive the bus"" and instead let the relationship unfold (hey, I'm a type A and the firstborn daughter--I'm used to taking charge--and and I'm getting better at that, at \*not\* taking charge, and staying in the moment and feeling grateful for it. And I'm having an amazing time in the meantime. So, that's my update. :)

Surprisingly the chocolate flavors of the Kahlua were at the forefront. The Kahlua didn't necessarily dominate, but I kept having to remember to find the tequila and pineapple when tasting. It almost tasted like a 2000's drink I would get in a Fruitopia vending machine called 'Chocolate Drink'. 

If I make it again I'm sticking with Kahlua, I'm not a coffee person, so I'm not too interested in buying more coffee liquors, and it makes sense to use a Mexican product when using tequila and cinnamon syrup.

1ms54q1,https://i.redd.it/vl2p8xpmnfjf1.png,Hyatt Regency Bellevue on Seattle East Side Review,"Stayed at the Hyatt Regency Bellevue recently. Didn't take many pictures of the room because I wasn't planning to do a review at the time but I'll do my best. 
Status at the time: Explorist
Room booked: 1 King Bed
Upgraded to: 1 King Bed High Floor
Welcome Amenity: Brut Sparkling Wine and Chocolate covered strawberries, not pictured because they were in the fridge. I told them my husband and I had gotten married the month before. They wrote a card congradulating us too. Overall, a really nice touch.
Room: Felt very large for two people with plenty of room to spread out. Had a great view of Lake Washington out the window to the right, which I could easily see from the couch. The bathroom was a standard shower/bath combo but had one of those hotel shower drains that leave extra room at the bottom of the regular drain. I like baths, so took baths pretty often and once saw a piece of floss floating around which I think the maids missed because of the way the drain functions. Bed was nice, although they only had a very thin feather comforter. Maybe we could have called down to get another, but I would have preferred more options on the bed or in the room rather having to call. We made it worked. 
Location: Connected to Bellevue Square, there are several covered bridges you can walk on to get to other buildings. It's not fully enclosed so you you still get the temperatures, but it will protect you from precipitation as long as it's not to windy. It's also located in central Bellevue so overall a good location. 
Parking: Self-parking is located under the building and free Friday and Saturday night. Sunday-Thurday it is $37. I did self-parking and it wasn't included for points. Wasn't expecting it to, but wanted to include this detail if anyone cares. Valet parking is also an option, but costs $47 including on Friday and Saturday. Both options have in-and-out privileges. 
Restaurants: Listed below. 
Eques: Technically the only Hyatt-connected restaurant, although there were several restaurants in the building. Only open for breakfast. I had the Tiramisu pancakes which I really enjoyed. They had a thin layer of frosting but still weren't too sweet, which I appreciated. Kind of felt like eating crepes, but thicker. Husband had an omelet which they will custom make with any toppings you like. Earned points here for breakfast, if anyone's curious. 
13 Coins: Opened most hours. I think I preferred this restaurant to Eques a little more, but mostly because they just had more variety. Had a lot of Eggs Benedict dishes, which I really like. Serve the whole menu whenever open. 
Fonté Coffee Roaster: Grabbed a rose latte from here and it was really good. They also serve breakfast sandwiches and I think salads, but it's all pre-made and grab and go style.
Suite Bellevue: Club that serves small plates and drinks. Alright, but kind of seems overpriced. On Friday's and Saturdays they have complimentary aerial arts show, which we missed, but wish we saw. I'd probably go somewhere else unless you can catch the act, but the act might make the prices worth it. 
Din Tai Fung: Technically in the next building, but it was one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle and Bellevue, so I'm including it anyways. Take the bridge over to the next building, then go down to the first floor. Great cocktails and I had the pork noodles, chicken dumplings, and chocolate dumplings. Definitely get the chocolate dumplings with salted whipped cream, they're to die for.

Coffee naps is the practice of taking a 20 minute nap following the consumption of a cup of coffee, or any other source of caffeine. Studies show that caffeine takes on average 20 minutes to start to kick in. The function of the nap is to decrease adenosine so that when you wake up from the nap you are in a state of hyper-awareness. Meaning that during the test you will be wide awake and alert to every question coming your way.

But obviously, why would you risk sleep for 20 minutes when any more than that can cause you to enter a state of deep sleep and; A either feel sluggish and B miss your test completely. So this practice seems to me too high of a risk for a mid to high reward.

## Key Features Analysis

The Funko Pop Mug embodies a blend of functionality andcollectibility,presenting several notable features.

**Design Accuracy:** The most crucial feature of any Funko Pop Mug is how accurately it replicates the character's design. Top-tier mugs boast meticulous attention to detail, mirroring the signature oversized head, simplified features, and distinctive outfits of their corresponding Funko Pop figures. This includes precise paint request,faithful proportions,and the accurate representation of character-specific accessories or markings. the better the design mimics the original Pop, the greater its appeal to collectors.

**Material Quality:** The quality of the materials used in crafting a Funko Pop Mug directly impacts its durability and longevity. Ceramic is the most common material, offering a good balance of sturdiness and heat retention. though, the quality of the ceramic can vary significantly. Higher-quality ceramics resist chipping and cracking better,and the glaze maintains its luster over time. Some manufacturers also incorporate stoneware, known for its remarkable durability, though this can increase the mug's weight.**Mug Size & Capacity:** The size and capacity of the Funko Pop Mug directly influence its practicality. Most mugs range from 11 to 15 ounces, a pleasant size for most beverages. However, the design of the mug can affect its usable capacity. Mugs with complex shapes or protruding features may hold less liquid than their simple counterparts.Ideal mugs provide ample capacity without sacrificing design integrity.

**Handle Design & Ergonomics:** The handle design of a Funko Pop Mug is crucial for comfortable use. Handles should be ergonomically shaped to provide a secure grip, even when the mug is full of hot liquid. Thin or awkwardly shaped handles can be uncomfortable and potentially hazardous. Mugs with thicker, contoured handles generally offer the best user experience, allowing for a secure and natural grip.**Paint Application & Durability:** The quality and durability of the paint application are paramount for maintaining the mug's aesthetic appeal over time. High-quality mugs feature accurately applied paint with vibrant colors and crisp lines. The paint should be resistant to fading, chipping, and scratching, even after repeated use and washing. Mugs with baked-on or sealed paint finishes typically offer superior durability compared to those with surface-applied paints.

**Collectibility & Rarity:** In the Funko Pop world, collectibility and rarity significantly impact a mug's value and desirability. Limited edition mugs, convention exclusives, and chase variants are notably sought after by collectors. These rare mugs often feature unique designs or color variations, making them highly prized additions to any collection. A mug's scarcity directly translates to its long-term value and potential thankfulness.

I really like him and he checks almost all the boxes I’m looking for in a partner. The only thing is, he’s not as “manly” as I’m used to, he’s more on the soft side. I wouldn’t say that he’s feminine, just not as traditionally masculine as the guys I’ve dated in the past. In a way, it’s great because he’s very emotionally intelligent. He’s open with his feelings and really cares about mine. But at the same time, I feel like an asshole for being bothered by little things. Just a few examples: he told me he was scared of spiders and snakes, that he checks what the UV is outside before he goes for a walk to make sure he gets tan, and his coffee order is an iced brown sugar oatmilk shaken espresso. 

We text throughout the day, and today he sent me a text saying, “I’m gonna cry,” because he was having problems building a desk organizer for his sister. I read it and immediately got the ick… I have no idea why it just came off in my head like something a girl would say.

Anyway, I’ve been trying to reach out to hang out or get a coffee or just catch up via text but she barely responds. She’s never been great at texting back, I can expect maybe a week between responses (not even exaggerating). It just seems like now she’s just dropped off the face of the earth.

God, I sound like a jerk but I wish we had better communication. A text just saying ‘Hey, I’m super busy but I’ll get back’ would go a long way.

Hey everyone,

We’re just 3 friends who got tired of seeing the same mass-produced wallets everywhere. Everything felt the same  low quality, short-lived, and lacking soul. So, we decided to do something about it.

After months of trial, error, late nights, and more coffee than we’d like to admit 😅, we’ve crafted something we’re truly proud of: a premium leather wallet that brings back elegance, durability, and timeless style to an everyday essential.

We’re officially in the prelaunch phase of our Kickstarter, and honestly, this is the hardest part. New creators like us don’t have the reach or big budgets even if we pour our hearts into building something genuine and high quality, it’s tough to get noticed in such a crowded space.

That’s why we’re reaching out here. Not just for backers, but for support, advice, and encouragement from people who know how hard it is to start something new.

👉 You can check out our Kickstarter prelaunch page here:
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pellemoro/pelle-moro-model-no1

👉 And if you want to reserve an early-bird spot, we set up a simple landing page where you can support us with just $1:
https://subscribepage.io/6zESVD

It may not seem like much, but even a single dollar (and a kind word) gives us the momentum and confidence to keep pushing forward.

We know trust is earned, not given so we’ll be sharing updates, behind the scenes looks at our design and production, and listening to feedback along the way.

1ms4qae,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1ms4qae/advice_needed/,Advice needed,"Hi nanny Reddit community! I need some advice/ pointers. I recently took on a new nanny/ house manager position for a HNW family. I have been with them for about 3 months now. Aside from many other things, the main issue I’m dealing with is the absolute asshole of a dad boss I have to work with daily. 

For starters, he is simply an old, grouchy, mean and controlling man. The way I constantly hear him verbally abuse his wife is sickening (I lived in with them for the whole summer). He needs to be in control of everyone and everything and this definitely rubs off on me. 

Part of my contract is doing the families laundry. He is VERY strict about his laundry and the exact way it is done and if I make one mistake, he will make it known and speak to me in a very degrading tone and make me feel like an idiot. 

He requests that his laundry is done twice a week and if I ever let it sit in the dryer for more than 1 minute, he freaks out saying it’s wrinkly and takes it out on his wife. 

So, what I’ve been struggling with recently is the fact that he wants his laundry all processed and folded for him within the span of one work day. This usually isn’t an issue, however, yesterday I started his laundry the literal second I got to work and then NK and I left the house. We had a play date scheduled and then had to go straight from there to pick up other NK and take them to their activity. So, I didn’t get back to the house until 5:00 which is when I’m off. So that being said I literally couldn’t  get his laundry done. 

Sure enough, like he always does whenever I don’t do something right, he goes and puts a message on the shared app we use to keep track of to dos and lists. He says “my name, the whole load of laundry was left in the dryer. Also, please don’t forget to clean my coffee pots every day”. 

I never know what to say to this man. I will not respond to his stupid little message on a Friday night. But the next week I see him I just know he’s going to yell at me for this. Am I wrong to stick up for myself and “talk back” to let him know why I couldn’t get his laundry done? I guess he genuinely thinks I can be at 2 places at once. 

Also, he never lets me use the car. His wife will tell me I can use HER car to go do an errand he will text me asking where I went and to confirm with him before I ever leave in the car. Also, the wife will literally text me saying hey will you go get some fish from the grocery store for dinner? I’ll get the fish and he texts me saying “always check with me before getting something. I would have suggested otherwise”. 

This is literally just the TIP of the iceberg and I could go on and on and on about the many instances where he has spoken to me in such a horrible way and said some absolute crazy things to me. Help!!! I can’t stand this and I’m 3 months into my 2 year contract. 

Oh ALSO they’ve had 5 Nannie’s in the past 4 years and can’t keep one. The pay is a crazy amount which is the ONLY reason I’m staying and I think also the only reason they can get a nanny to begin with, bc they have to deal with their crazy, toxic shit on a daily basis. 

ALSO towards the very beginning of my first week with them they switched up the contract after I signed it and went back on their word for a lot of things. For example I went on vacation with them the literal first week I got hired and in the contract it says “all meals when traveling with family are GENEROUSLY paid for”. I had to eat out this whole vacation bc of no food in the fridge, I couldn’t go to the store bc I didn’t have a car, etc. I asked MB if I would get reimbursed for all the meals I was buying and she tried to tell me no and that they didn’t do that.

I’m one of the cofounders of a tiny startup from South Asia (so small we don’t even have a website yet — maybe one day 🤞).

We’ve been tinkering with AI tools to make the life of fleet managers a little less stressful. Our current agent can read reports, figure out when equipment is getting close to the end of its lifetime, and then chase down vendors for quotes and maintenance (yes, it even sends emails and makes phone calls — so managers don’t have to play phone tag all day).

We’ve tried this with a couple of small ship management companies, and it seems to save some headache. I’d love to hear from the folks here — do you think something like this could actually be useful for more people in the industry, or are we just over-engineering what a strong cup of coffee already solves? 🙂",0,1755371596.0,maritime,1,0.38,False

I'm posting mostly aimlessly as I'm really only looking for: conversations that last until they don't. What does that even mean? Good question. Really, I just want to vibe without forcing it. You know those sweet sweet conversation that just seem to carry on and on and on and on and then you're left curious wanting to ask a new question to fully understand what the other person is saying and you so badly want them to understand you and maybe it's really easy and now you realize that maybe for the next hour or so you're not as alone as you thought you were? And also, they love a good run-on as much as the next guy? 

That. I want that. 

Things I love enough to mention about me: 

\- I. love. food. Grocery shopping is a favorite pastime, I like traveling through it, I like making it from scratch, I like ordering it in. I like knowing what someone's mom made them when they were sick growing up that is now their go to when they have the sniffles. I want to know what plate of food makes you do a little foot tap while you eat it because it just HITS. 

\- I'm a disgusting morning person. I always feel the most optimistic when I wake up. It's an opportunity for change. I think people are allowed to try new ways of living all the time. Though I usually will give up once 6 or 7pm hits. 

\- I'm creative. I like writing haikus about things when it tickles my fancy, I'll draw an apple all scribbly and artistic like and then I'll think I can do a self portrait and then wince at the monster I've drawn. Maybe with practice? No! Because, routine is something I'm trying to build and I should probably start with taking my iron supplement and drink more water daily before I tackle being a master drawer. So I only hit it when the mood strikes. 

Anything worth something comes in 3's. So we can start here. Now it's up to you to decide if I'll be that guy eating up your run-on's or not. Though, your first message helps me decide how tasty your run-ons will be, too. ",1,1755371584.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

1ms4nxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1ms4nxg/find_out_if_the_best_single_serve_espresso/,Find Out if the Best Single Serve Espresso Machine by Nespresso Delivers,"The Nespresso EN127BL Pixie Espresso Machine by De'Longhi has quickly become a staple in my kitchen. As someone who loves starting the day with a strong, perfectly brewed espresso, I was drawn to this machine's promise of compact design and powerful performance right out of the box. The sleek dark blue finish, paired with its industrial style, immediately caught my eye, but it wasn't just about the looks—there’s much more to this machine than meets the eye.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This espresso machine feels like a testament to excellent design. Its polished metal sides and solid steel handle give it a robust and premium feel. With compact dimensions of 12.76 inches deep, 4.6 inches wide, and 9.25 inches high, it fits seamlessly into small spaces, such as my narrow kitchen counter. For those who love minimalism in style but refuse to compromise on performance, this machine easily stands out. The hammered metal sides add a modern industrial touch without looking out of place in a cozy home. Honestly, even switching it on feels satisfying, as the buttons have a sturdy, tactile feel.

**Performance and 19-Bar Pump Pressure**  
I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from the high-pressure 19-bar extraction system, but it delivered rich, aromatic coffee consistently with every cup. Whether I wanted a classic espresso shot or a lungo for a longer sipping experience, this machine didn’t disappoint. It brought out the intense aromas and nuanced flavors from each capsule. The bar pressure truly makes a difference—you can tell the coffee extraction is thorough and professional-grade, especially when paired with Nespresso’s premium capsules.

[Check Nespresso EN127BL price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0djg16y9s/)

**Ease of Use and Intuitive Operation**  
This machine’s semi-automatic operation is surprisingly effortless. Having just two options—Espresso and Lungo—keeps it simple, and each button press gets me the perfect cup without any guesswork. I appreciate how user-friendly it is; even a friend visiting for the weekend was able to whip up a proper espresso without me explaining anything. Also, the descaling warning light is a thoughtful addition. It not only ensures the machine operates at its best but also helps prolong its lifespan—pretty useful since I’m prone to forgetting maintenance routines.

**Energy Efficiency and Sustainability Features**  
On the sustainability front, this coffee maker shuts off automatically after two minutes of inactivity, a feature that has already proven to be a money saver on my electricity bill. It's one of those thoughtful little touches that build trust in a product. Additionally, the reusable filter coupled with the coffee capsule system feels like a balanced nod to both convenience and environmental responsibility. For someone who’s trying to reduce waste without entirely giving up on the ease of capsule machines, this strikes a nice middle ground.

**Pluses**  
• Compact design perfect for countertops with limited space  
• Premium industrial aesthetics with sturdy, polished finishes  
• Rich and aromatic coffee extraction thanks to the 19-bar pump pressure  
• Quickly heats up, saving you time during busy mornings  
• Energy-efficient auto-shutdown feature  

**Drawbacks**  
• Lacks a milk frother, limiting coffee drink options for enthusiasts of cappuccinos or lattes  
• Only compatible with Nespresso Original capsules, leaving less room for generic or third-party options  
• Small water reservoir means it requires frequent refilling if used often  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this to similar models from other brands, such as the Keurig K-Supreme or the Breville Bambino, a few differences stood out. The Nespresso Pixie has a much more compact design and higher pressure capabilities, but it does lack the milk frothing capability that many competitors include in their base models. Keurig’s range does offer more versatility with ground coffee and pods, but I’ve found their espresso shots aren’t as robust as what this machine delivers. Breville’s Bambino provides a fancier espresso experience, but with its larger footprint and higher price point, it might not suit those who want simplicity or lack counter space. Ultimately, for someone seeking a balance between premium espresso quality and space efficiency, the Pixie hits a sweet spot.

**Price Performance**  
Given its premium design, reliable performance, and high-bar pressure system, the Pixie provides great bang for the buck. It caters nicely to someone who enjoys high-quality espresso, sans bulk or overly complex features. While some might argue there are cheaper alternatives, the build quality and thoughtful design here feel worth the investment. It’s ideal for individuals, couples, or those aiming for a sleek, no-nonsense appliance to instantly elevate their mornings. Accessibility to Nespresso capsules makes it incredibly user-friendly, though it may not be the best option for budget-conscious buyers wanting broad compatibility.

1ms4np8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemyBeauty/comments/1ms4np8/delve_into_the_best_carpet_cleaner_3d_car_care/,Delve Into the Best Carpet Cleaner 3D Car Care Review Worth It,"It’s not often that a cleaning product genuinely surprises me, but using 3D Car Care Products AX-AY-ABHI-01329 Upholstery & Carpet Shampoo has been a game-changer in my routine. After countless attempts to refresh my aging rugs and car upholstery with other brands, I decided to put this high-foam stain remover and odor eliminator to the test. Spoiler alert: it did not disappoint.

**User-Friendly Formula With High Foaming Action**  
The first thing I noticed when I poured the product was its thick consistency, accompanied by a pleasant lemon scent—not overpowering like some other cleaners that leave your room smelling like a chemical plant. The high-foam formula was ideal for tackling tough spots and stains. Whether it was my car seats, a grimy sofa in my living room, or even the occasional blotch on my carpet, the foam worked its magic. A little bit went a long way; the lather covered a surprisingly large surface area.

[Check 3D Car Care Products AX-AY-ABHI-01329 Upholstery & Carpet Shampoo price on Amazon.](https://stylistexperts.com/p/b0007rvleu/)

**Exceptional Stain Removal Abilities**  
I’ve had everything from spilled coffee to pet accidents making my carpets and car interiors look like I completely gave up on cleanliness. Applying just a small amount of this shampoo directly onto the stains and working it in with a brush brought back textures I thought were lost forever. Spots that I had resigned myself to living with disappeared after one cleaning session. Even my dog’s go-to spot on the carpet, which usually smells faintly “doggish”—no matter how many cleaners I’ve tried—smelled refreshingly lemony afterward.

**The ""Like New"" Brightness Factor**  
Thanks to the optical brighteners in this product, my carpets and upholstery seemed to shine in a way I wasn’t expecting. Colors didn’t just lighten; they looked restored. My living room carpet, for instance, took on a revitalized look that reminded me of how it appeared when I first brought it home. This wasn’t just surface-level cleaning; it felt like the life of the fabric was being restored.

**Compact Packaging for a Large Cleaning Job**  
The gallon-sized container might seem oversized to someone cleaning a small area, but trust me, it’s justified. At 9.06 pounds, it’s not the lightest product to lug around, but the design of the container is surprisingly practical and easy to store. While it contains enough cleaner to last months, the flip side is that you might need a funnel for transferring the liquid into smaller, handier spray bottles for on-the-go use.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Effectively eliminates deep-seated stains and odors.  
- Provides a refreshing, citrus scent that isn’t overpowering.  
- The concentrated lather ensures long-lasting usage with minimal product required.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Fairly heavy and slightly cumbersome when you just need a small amount.  
- No applicator tool or sprayer is included, which might be inconvenient if you’re working on upholstery or vertical surfaces.  

**Product Contenders**  
When comparing this to other name brands like Resolve or Woolite, I found the 3D formula to be concentrated and more economical in the long term. While Resolve offers good stain removal, it sometimes required multiple applications, which wasn’t the case here. Woolite is known for its fabric-friendly effects, but it doesn’t have the high-foaming action that makes scrubbing easier and faster. Both alternative brands often have synthetic scents that I find overwhelming; the lemon scent here felt natural and refreshing.

Compared to higher-end auto upholstery cleaners like Chemical Guys’ Fabric Clean, this shampoo performed equally well without the price tag typically associated with luxury car care products. It may not come with a sprayer like some competitors, but the versatility it offers—working on everything from car interiors to household furniture—sets it apart.

**Bang for the Buck**  
The price for this upholstery shampoo seems reasonable given the gallon size and the product's excellent performance. I’ve used smaller bottles from other brands that barely lasted a month, but this one has stayed reliable and effective over multiple uses. Its concentrated nature means you’re not wasting gallons of water rinsing out excessive suds like with some rival options. If you need a single product that can handle both your car and your home, this is it. [Curious about 3D Car Care Products AX-AY-ABHI-01329 Upholstery & Carpet Shampoo cost?

I just need to vent out what I’m feeling right now, and I hope she can read this too.


Hi ga,

I don’t know where I should start. I don’t even know what I should say pa. But I love you, I really really do. 

I can’t explain what I am feeling right now. Although it’s been only months since nakasabay kita sa bus, the pain feels like I’ve known you for half of my life. I first saw you sa pila ng bus, I didn’t notice you at first, but then there was a time na nakaharap kita sa bus, and instantly, I fell in love at that moment.

One day, I had the courage to approach you. I tried offering you a TicTac, deep inside hoping na you would accept it. And luckily, you did. That’s where our story started. Fate must have been kind to me. I kept waiting for you sa bus stop. I don’t know if I ever told you this, but I waited for hours sa nearby coffee shops kung saan tayo sumasakay pauwi, just to have the chance to ride the bus with you. There were days na hindi kita nakikita, but there were also days na nakakasabay kita. Then the day came na I prayed really hard for you to notice me. Tinabihan mo ako, and it felt like slow motion. We exchanged names, even our social media accounts. Then we started chatting.

At first, I was hesitant to confess my feelings. Baka naguguluhan lang ako since this was my first time to fall in love with a girl. I was confused bakit ako nagkakagusto sa babae, since I’m a girl too.

Days and months passed, and it felt like a dream. Those happy moments we shared ga, I will treasure them forever. Until one day, things started getting colder and colder. I’m sorry if we ended like this. I’m really, really sorry if I got myself too busy with my review and didn’t notice that our love was melting away like a candle. I’m sorry if I took you for granted. Sorry if I was too focused on my future that I forgot you were there too.. You, who pushed me to pursue the things I love. You, who pushed me to become an architect. And here I am, trying my best for the future I imagined, yung future na kasama ka. I was too focused, until one day I realized you were slowly walking away na.

I asked you for another chance, if you could give me one, but you said pagod ka na. I’m really sorry. Aaminin ko, I was really hurt by the way you treated me these past few weeks. Your replies grew colder every day. They became harder to read. It felt like they came from a different person. It pained me to read your messages, like you were truly mad at me. Until it reached the point na I couldn’t handle it anymore. I couldn’t focus on my review because I kept questioning my self-worth and what I did wrong for us to end up like this.

I pray na you’ll remember me as the person you first knew, not the one who caused you pain. And I pray that my heart will eventually heal from this pain. I promise I’ll become an architect. I’ll try my best to pass this board exam.

I love you. I really, really do. Please, be happy without me. Sorry if I didn’t realize that I was the one making your light dim. I should have been the one to make you shine in every way, but I ended up being the one who caused your light to fade. 😔

Life places the right stars in the sky—always in its perfect time. I’ll stop opening doors for the people who keep walking away. Pinapalaya na kita. Mahal kita.

So I met this guy after we connected on Instagram. We chatted on and off for 2–3 weeks (not constantly, just whenever we both had time). He works in another state, but recently he came back home (which happens to be in the same state as me).

He asked if I wanted to meet, and since I’m single, I thought why not. We planned a movie and then coffee afterward. He booked the movie tickets and paid for them. When we went for coffee, I offered to pay since he already covered the movie, but he didn’t let me.

After that, we sat and had a really nice, long chat. He then dropped me home. I texted him when I got home, and he replied when he reached too. He also thanked me, gave me compliments, and said he had a great time. We kept talking after that.

But then, kind of out of nowhere, he said something like:

“Our date came to around ₹2500. If you’re okay with splitting, it would be ₹1250 each. Would that work for you?”

I ended up paying my share but now I’m a bit confused about how to feel. It’s not really about the money, but more about what it means or does it say something about how he sees me?. I’ve always believed(seen) that a real gentleman wouldn’t let a woman pay, but maybe I’m wrong, should I feel bothered by this, or is it normal nowadays? Also, how should I approach situations like this in the future?

For context, he’s doing well in his career, has no financial issues or anything like that.

The title says it all i am 27yo and plan to walk the Lycian way alone as my first time hike.  
Timing of it is perfect for me for work reasons. I will be working on the closest city from the beginning of the of the trail for a week and after 21 days i will be needed at the closest city to the end of the trail so i thought why not walk it? It has always been in my bucket list and if i dont do it now i will most likely will never do it.

Now i never realy hiked or camped in the wild before (not counting camping at camp sites with 100's of people running water and electricity) but i have been in the wild for my fairshare  as a kid (picnics at mountains in winter when it snows, etc.) I am also an avid city walker i used to and still walk quite long distances out of whim and recently quit smoking. never realy walked with a heavy backpack though.

For all the reasons above i have decided to finaly do it. Tried to get a few of my friends with me too but no one wants to come so i will be doing it alone.

Now i am not realy that worried about being alone in the trail as it is quite a famous one and i believe i will be encountering a lot of people who are also walking it and i dont plan to do the all 550KM in that short amount i will take it slow and most likely bail out at the end of the first section Kaş since i believe i can find help from some of the villagers to take me out of the road quite easly. Plus i will need to be at the next city in 21 days and i dont think i can walk 550km in 21 days.

However i am worried of getting lost, taking wrong equipment, difficulty of the road, injuring myself, bugs, packing too heavy, so i need any and all advices possible.

I tried to find a mid shoes without GTX however it is almost impossible to find one here and i realy want the support of a mid shoe so i will be taking a gtx one (i will be on september its going to be hot)

I've heard that it is quite a dry route so i plan to take 3 litres of water with me all the time is it too much or too low? I dont want to make my bag too heavy.

for tent i plan on getting a nature hike cloud 2 but i plan to stay on guesthouses and eat at restaurants if i can find on the route aswell so not always camping

should i get a stove with me aswell some coffee with me would be nice but its heavy

The hamper is literally *right there* next to the bathroom, but his clothes always end up on the floor next to it. I’ve told him multiple times that it causes me physical pain when I trip and slide on his clothes, and it hurts to bend over and pick his crap up off the floor (my back is a mess). This is still a recurring thing every. Damn. Day.

Then I go to take my morning meds, need to get water to take them - but the water filter is empty, because my husband filled up his giant-ass water bottle without refilling the filter.

So I go to get the pitcher so I can fill the filter… but the pitcher isn’t there. So I spend ten minutes hunting the pitcher down, because my husband used it to fill the dog’s water bowls this morning and shoved it on a random shelf in the other room instead of putting it back in the kitchen.

Finally I find the pitcher, bring it to the sink to fill with water to fill the filter so I can finally take my meds - except the sink is full of dirty dishes and I can’t even fit the pitcher under the faucet to fill it.

So now I clear out the sink. Some of the dishes in there smell awful and have caked-on crap that takes forever to clear off, because my husband didn’t bother to even *rinse* anything. His old coffee cups had mold in them, and one of our mixing bowls might be stained permanently because he left cherry goop in it for days.

Shit like this is how I spend the first half hour of every morning, and when my husband asks me why I’m so cranky in the mornings, I kinda want to tell him to shut the f up.",56,1755370687.0,rant,26,0.9,False

But maybe time isn't a healer—maybe it's a sculptor, chiseling around your pain until you can carry it without flinching. Maybe it doesn’t erase the wounds. Maybe it just teaches you how to wear them.

I met her through a mutual friend—one of those forgettable nights that life would later highlight in bold. A casual gathering that turned into a quiet revolution in my soul. We were young then. Reckless. We were young, reckless, full of cheap liquor and late-night conversations about life, history, and even video games. The kind of talks that stretch into 5 a.m. drives with the windows down, the world asleep and just the two of us alive in it.

It felt easy. Free. Unlabeled. Just friends—or so I repeated like a prayer to keep the chaos inside from spilling out. But she was a gravitational field, and I was the fool who kept orbiting closer, pulled in by the sheer force of her existence.

She was a paradox—someone who could laugh at my darkest jokes and still make the world feel lighter. Who’d dismantle my half-baked theories on ancient empires but never once made me feel small. And somehow, she always knew when I didn’t need words—just silence thick enough to sit in.

We shared beds like we shared secrets—clothed, hearts synchronized like matching metronomes, the air between us humming with all the things we didn’t say. I could have kissed her. I wanted to. But I was scared. Because I break things. And she was the kind of beautiful you don’t risk breaking.

Then came him—the one she gave her heart to. And when he shattered it, I was there with the glue, piecing her back together while I fell apart in silence. Her tears fell like rain, and I was the umbrella that always stayed open.

We traveled. We chased adventures like fireflies in a jar. I still remember the mountains—the cold, the laughter, her sister. One stupid outburst from me poisoned it all. My temper flared, and just like that, the air turned heavy. The drive back was a funeral procession of unspoken apologies. I thought I lost her that day. But somehow, we buried it deep, like a scar beneath long sleeves. Never spoken of again.

She showed me her shadows. Raw, bleeding truths about her past, her pain, the ghosts she still danced with at night. I listened. I held space. And I fell. Harder than before. Like diving into a storm with no umbrella, no life jacket—just her name echoing in my bones.

And then came the night in the valley where the wolves gather. Just us. A bottle of Jack. Too many memories and not enough distance. We laughed, walked the cliff's edge of temptation, and finally—finally—we jumped. We made love like two souls who had been waiting lifetimes. Drunk. Foolish. Honest. It was a wildfire, and I let it consume me.

It was awkard. We didn't talk for weeks. Silence wrapped us like a shroud. I thought it was over.

But fate, that relentless puppeteer, had other plans.

We stayed “friends”—whatever that meant anymore. I dated other girls. Slept with them. But they were echoes in a canyon where only her voice had ever sounded real. None of them were her. None ever would be.

In 2016, I flew to the U.S. for a summer that promised dreams and delivered distractions. Until she sent me that video. Just her, out with friends. Laughing. And that laugh? It tore something open in me. My chest caved in like a house condemned. I missed her in a way that felt biblical.

When I got back, we met. Her smile was an incantation. Her hug, a spell. For a breathless second, time stopped—just for us. The world held its breath as if hoping we’d finally get it right.

We danced back into rhythm like old songs rediscovered. But this time, it was different. More fragile. More real. And then came the beer pub night. She looked at me, eyes unshielded, and said she wanted to go home with me. No pretense. No games. Just us.

That night? That night felt like the universe handing me the missing piece of myself. I don’t remember the details—the room, the words. Just the way my soul settled into hers like it had always belonged there. For once, I wasn’t drifting. I was home.

But love, like all beautiful things, is also fragile.

We had moments. Two or three. Maybe more. Maybe fewer. But enough to break us.

One night, soaked in booze and honesty, she told me we’d never be together. Not the way I dreamed. “Just friends,” she said. I’d been friendzoned before. But this wasn’t that. This was knowing—knowing she felt something too, and still, she chose the safe road away from me.

Something inside me shut down that night. Like my heart unplugged and never really came back online. I became colder. A beautiful statue—perfectly intact, hollow inside. Outwardly charming, joking, alive. But inside? Just echoes. Just dust.

The second crack came quietly. A mundane night. I had work early. She wanted to party. Real life had finally laid its claim on me. She didn’t understand. We fought. She said I wasn’t fun anymore. That I’d changed.

They were drunken words. But they landed like knives forged from truth. That was probably the last night we ever truly had.

We drifted. Like satellites out of sync. From best friends, to almost-lovers, to familiar strangers.

She moved to the UK. Got her life on track now.

I got married. Had a son. Moved to another continet. Life—unstoppable, unforgiving—marched on.

But here’s the confession buried deepest in my soul: I never stopped loving her.

Even when I said “I do,” part of me whispered her name in the chapel silence. Even as I held my son for the first time, I felt her memory curled somewhere in my chest like a ghost that never left. We talked about kids - maybe as a joke, maybe some of it was real.

I adore my son beyond comprehension and i'd die for him faster than a blink. But her... she was the kind of love that etches itself into your DNA. The kind of connection you search for in others but never truly find again.

We lost each other. Or maybe we were never truly ours to begin with. Or maybe I was just a fool mistaking her warmth for love returned. But now, almost ten years later, I still wonder—does fate have one more card to play? Or will she just be the soft ache I carry into the afterlife?

She told me we could never be more than friends. Maybe that was the moment something in me broke permanently. Now, I guard my heart like a relic. I bury love before it can bloom. I choose silence over risk. I avoid deep waters because I drowned once—and I still haven’t dried off.

But if I had the chance—just one moment—to sit beside her again, car windows down, wind in our faces, laughing at nonsense and singing off-key, I’d take it. Hell, even five minutes over bad coffee would be a miracle.

Because with her?  
The spark never faded. It just settled quietly into my soul.

Lately, I think about flying to the UK. Not to knock on her door. Not to rekindle anything. She’s doing well now. And I genuinely hope—truly—that she’s found peace, love, happiness. She deserves all of it. Every last drop.

I wouldn’t disturb her life. I’d just... maybe sit across the street near where she works. Watch her laugh with her coworkers. See her sip her coffee. Maybe hear her voice on the wind... then just go back home and never look back.

Is it creepy? Romantic? Who the fuck knows anymore. All I know is this: after everything—every failure, every silence, every missed chance—I still think of her.

And maybe, just maybe...

I am more of a \*checks reddit for the answer\* person, and not really a user/poster here, so if I'm not formatting or whatever properly that's why. I have done some light electronics/home appliance repair, I'm not super knowledgeable, but generally, if it's taking things apart, finding out what's bad, and replacing the part, My spouse & I can usually figure it out, even if it takes awhile. The main thing is, I'm not super knowledgeable when it comes to the electrical bits, and what's ""acceptable"" as far as replacements go (amperage, voltage, etc. - maybe someday I'll get there). I usually just try to find the same part and/or same specs and replacing the bad bits, and hoping for the best.   
  
I need to replace a micro switch for a Breville BDC650 coffee maker - it's the bean hopper lock switch, the coffee maker keeps saying to lock the hopper, but it IS locked and the switch seems to be the problem (did various tests) but am having trouble finding a suitable replacement. 

Markings on the current one: Side 1: SC7303 10.1A 125VAC 6A 250VAC || Side 2: 3(3)A 250V \~ *μ*T125 5E4 (I have figured out the 5E4 just means it's rated to 50,000 uses).     
  
I have seen some newer versions of this model have 3 pins, at least ones I've found, but the model in the machine only has two. I have to look in the machine again to figure out if a three pin version would fit or not, or if the third pin might touch some other metal in there (there's two small springs in the area) which is one slight concern, but most possible replacements I find are all 3 pins, but any advice on what I should do about a third pin would be appreciated - can I remove it somehow? Should I wrap it or something? Can I just leave it?  
   
I was trying to find other switches with same specs, but most are 5A. Could I replace the switch with a 5A? Should I find one and just try it?   
I've seen that MicroMark has some micro switches that look super similar, but there are ZERO specs on the electronics bit (WTH?).   
  
Was going to try to bridge it so it just shows as ON/Locked all the time, but that doesn't work due to the style of setup/switch apparently. I don't remember the details so I can't elaborate, but basically, it doesn't work. 

I have seen the exact same switch being sold, but it was pulled out of another Breville so is used, and who knows if that one will last (besides the price being outrageous IMO), so I'd like to find a new item replacement if possible. The prices seem to be all over the place, and/or by the time I pay for shipping/overseas it is kind of ridiculous. I usually try to order items already in the US, mainly b/c I'm impatient and don't really want to wait a month or so for a part to arrive... but this has added another challenge, along with only finding the same parts in China, and/or only available in very large bulk. I don't mind getting multiples, maybe up to 10 if I think I might need something for another repair job, but I don't need hundreds. D:  
If I have to order one from overseas I will, so it's not a huge dealbreaker.   
  
I would add pics but idk how... so I hope the specs I gave work. Sorry for the long post with info you probably don't need, but idk what ya'll need. I just want some help/advice please, not an opinion on my coffee maker choices or whatever.   
Thanks reddit!

## Key Features Analysis

The features of a book wallet are what define its functionality and overall appeal. Materials, design, and security features all play a vital role.

**Material Quality:** Book wallets are crafted from a variety of materials, each offering different levels of durability, aesthetic appeal, and environmental friendliness. common choices include genuine leather, faux leather (PU leather), canvas, recycled materials, and even exotic options like cork or wood. High-quality genuine leather provides a luxurious feel and exceptional durability, often developing a unique patina over time. Faux leather offers a more affordable and vegan-amiable alternative,while canvas options provide a lightweight and casual aesthetic.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The external design of a book wallet is arguably its most significant aspect, as it determines its visual appeal. Manufacturers offer a wide range of designs, from faithful recreations of classic book covers to abstract patterns and personalized options. Some wallets feature intricate embossing, stitching, or foil details to enhance their visual impact. The size and shape of the wallet also vary, with some mimicking the dimensions of a small paperback and others adopting a more rectangular or square form factor.

**Storage Capacity:** The internal storage capacity of a book wallet dictates how many cards, bills, and other essentials it can comfortably accommodate. The number of card slots typically ranges from 4 to 12,with some wallets offering additional compartments for cash,coins,or a phone. The layout of the interior also varies, with some wallets featuring a bi-fold or tri-fold design, while others adopt a simpler single-fold style. A well-designed book wallet will strike a balance between storage capacity and overall bulkiness, ensuring that it remains agreeable to carry in a pocket or bag.

**Closure Mechanism:** The closure mechanism of a book wallet is crucial for security and convenience. Common options include snap closures, magnetic closures, zippers, and elastic bands. Snap closures provide a secure and reliable way to keep the wallet closed, while magnetic closures offer a more streamlined and quick-access option. Zippers provide the highest level of security,preventing cards and cash from falling out,but they can also add bulk to the wallet.Elastic bands are a simple and lightweight option, but they may not be as durable or secure as other closure mechanisms.

**Security Features:** Modern book wallets increasingly incorporate security features to protect against electronic theft and data breaches. RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) blocking technology is a common addition, which shields credit cards and other sensitive documents from unauthorized scanning. This technology works by creating a Faraday cage effect, preventing RFID signals from reaching the chips embedded in the cards. Some book wallets also incorporate additional security features, such as hidden compartments or anti-theft straps, to provide enhanced protection against physical theft.

## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of book wallets can bring about some questions. Here are answers to a few common ones.

**Are book wallets durable enough for everyday use?**

The durability of a book wallet depends largely on the quality of materials and construction. High-quality leather or reinforced canvas models can withstand daily wear and tear for years, while cheaper options may show signs of wear and tear more quickly. Look for wallets with reinforced stitching,durable closures,and protective linings to ensure longevity.Proper care,such as avoiding excessive moisture and cleaning regularly,can also extend the lifespan of your book wallet.

**How can I clean and maintain my book wallet?**

Cleaning and maintenance depend on the material of your book wallet.Leather wallets can be cleaned with a damp cloth and conditioned regularly to maintain their suppleness. Faux leather wallets can be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution. Canvas wallets can be spot-cleaned or hand-washed with a gentle detergent. avoid harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, and excessive moisture, as these can damage the material and compromise the wallet's integrity.

**can a book wallet replace a traditional wallet entirely?**

Whether a book wallet can replace a traditional wallet depends on your individual needs and preferences. If you carry a large number of cards,cash,or bulky items like receipts,a book wallet may not offer sufficient storage capacity. Though,if you prefer a minimalist lifestyle and only carry essential items,a book wallet can be a stylish and functional alternative. Some book wallets also include additional features like phone pockets or coin pouches, further enhancing their versatility.

1ms42wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1ms42wj/aita_for_kicking_my_ex_out/,AITA for kicking my ex out ?,"
My ex-broke up with me almost 2 months ago, and I asked him to move out so we could be no contact. He moved out about 2 weeks ago and moved into his converted van. It’s a nice rig with heating, water, a bed and even a fridge -think van-lifer set up. Unfortunately his van ended up breaking down and he reached out to me for help. I said he could stay over while his vehicle was at the mechanic’s. Being around him is still very upsetting for me, and I’ve told him being around him is bad for my mental health. However, of course I want to help him seeing as he doesn’t have a vehicle or home right now. He does have coworkers and a close friend he could stay with, and he has family about 2 hours away he could get a bus ride to stay with as well. I asked him to stay at his friend’s house for a few nights so I could have my peace back, but now he is back to crashing at mine. 

Now to the crux of the issue: I said he could stay the weekend, but I would really like to have some space and wanted him to stay at his friend’s house or get a hotel for a night or two starting Monday. He said he doesn’t want to feel like a burden, and since his friend hadn’t extended an invitation to stay over, he didn’t want to bother him again. He also doesn’t want to take the bus to stay at his family’s place because he doesn’t want to be so far away from his van if it gets fixed. Side note, his van has been at the mechanic’s for over a week, and they still don’t definitively know what’s wrong with it, so I think it is highly unlikely it will be fixed by Monday or Tuesday.  He also isn’t working right now, although he should be able to start picking up hours within the next week or two. He makes decent money and has enough in savings to afford a month or two without working…. All this in mind, I asked if he could get a hotel for a night or two; they only go for around $70-120 a night where we are located. I think these are all reasonable suggestions for alternative accommodations, but he said he would prefer not to burden anyone else and doesn’t want to spend the money on a hotel. He said if being at my place makes me too uncomfortable, then he would “sleep in his van at night at the mechanic’s shop and bum around town during the day”. I pointed out it’s been over 100 degrees during the day recently, and I don’t live in a very walkable neighborhood. It’s really just the suburbs. The closest coffee shop is miles away … we had a long, heated discussion about this topic, in which I was crying profusely. I told him I don’t want him around because it is painful to see him, but I also don’t want him to be essentially “homeless” and wandering around during the day. I would prefer if he stayed with a friend or got a hotel. If he absolutely refused to do those things, he could stay with me, but it is frankly negatively impacting me to have him around. He said he doesn’t understand why I care so much, and he feels confident about his decision because he has lived out of his car before. He also said I see his choice as uncomfortable because I am “a priss” but that the idea of wandering around doesn’t make him uncomfortable. I told him “if we were in opposite positions, he wouldn’t want me to be out wandering around and that I’m sorry I care so much”. I also told him if he called his mom or his friends they would say the same thing I am -that it’s a better idea to stay with someone or get a hotel. He repeatedly brushed me off while I was crying, asking him to just get a hotel for my sake. 

My dilemma is this then. I feel immense guilt essentially asking him to leave and stay in his broken down van (which he can’t be in during the day while the mechanic is working on it). However, I also am very depressed having him around and don’t know how much longer I can carry on this way. I know the healthiest solution is to ask him to leave, but morally I don’t know if I can do that knowing he isn’t going to get a hotel or ask for help from his friends or family. So, AITA for asking him to leave even though I know it essentially means making him homeless?",6,1755370226.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,34,0.88,False

Edinburg - 
- walk around/check out local coffee shops/bars
- underground tour 
- book stores 
- Stockbridge market (Sunday)
- free Harry Potter tour 
- Islander purse workshop 

We’d also love to visit the Highlands, Glencoe, and Glenfinnan viaduct. 

I wish we had more time to visit Isle of Skye. It’ll have to be on another visit.

Things we’d enjoy: hiking, people watching, reading, trying new foods and an overall sense of adventure.

overall: bangkok thai on campus (curry/pad thai/pho/fried rice/misc), watson’s shack and rail off campus (chicken, wedges, various sides, cocktails/mocktails; try the brussel sprouts! and the restaurant is much better than the food truck, although it’s also good)

sushi: sushi man; prospect location off campus is better for actual meals (AYCE and bigger meal deals) but green st is also great 

Mediterranean: shawarma joint, great value 

pizza: papa del’s off campus (deep dish), mia za’s on campus (the thick individual slice is much better than the full flat pizzas)

steak: Texas Roadhouse (obligatory; also really really good value, $20 or less for a good simple steak w two huge sides and infinite rolls, the vibes are…. American) off campus

avoid: Panda Express and noodle company on green st (campus); mcdonalds on both green and neil (on and off campus); kofusion (off campus?); smoothie king near the DMV (off campus) (the one on neil was fine last I went); these are a mix of terrible service, subpar hygiene/sanitation, and chance of food poisoning (and in kofusion’s case, treatment of staff)

I'm actually savouring each mouthful of black coffee, swishing it around so it hits different spots on my tongue etc. It's actually some of the best coffee I ever remember having.

Roughly:

3 days in Sydney

3 days to drive to Melbourne along the coast 

1 day in Melbourne

3 days to drive to Adelaide

1 day in Adelaide

2 days back to Sydney

2. Where would you spend the extra day?

3. Interests are anything uniquely Australian, wildlife, waterfalls, weirder museums, nifty beer or coffee spots... and as nature adventures go, more the 2 KM walk to a waterfall/light house/koalas, less 8 KM adventures. What little places along the way would you recommend?

Make a note that my dad knew this person in the past. He was 'M35' at that point we met. I could tell he liked me by the way he looked at me and i did too. I was 'F25' at the time. After a few times i got a follow on instagram and almost all my pics had a like by this person i had a feeling it was him even though the account had no pics and was new so i messaged him and it was him so we started talking. Fast forward after a week.

They came pretty frequently there on their break and sometimes every day and we were talking i also opened up to him about being trans and he opened up to me about his past and his drug abuse. Things progressed and we wanted to go out for a drink we did then we had sex we kept talking and seeing eachother sometimes without sex. He told me that due to his past he didnt feel comfortable having a serious relationship with me because many times he was high on drugs he interacted with my dad and if he was in my dads place he wouldn't want his daughter to be with someone like him. When i tried to make him more comfortable with this he recogizing his shame he said at one point maybe how he feels will change he doesnt know so many times he went back and forth about how he felt. Like he wanted but also not.
He made plans with me for the summer which gave me hope. He also told me im one of the few girls he had sex with and he felt it meant something it wasnt just regular sex plus we like the same stuff so that was a plus.
 In the winter of 2023 before new years i got sick and ended up in hospital spending new years eve and new years there and he came to see me and he would message me everyday to see how im doing. 

After i recovered we met again and fooled around a bit mainly he tried to please me he also confessed he loved me and after a few days he called me and he wanted to end it. He told me everytime he had sex with me he had a skin reaction his skin peeled off his doctor said he shouldnt see me because its like his basically allergic to me and when i asked for pictures he didnt want to show i got tested multiple times and i was always clean no stis no infections. This made me hate my parts and i felt very broken. After he dumped me i was very depressed for very long and went to therapy i worked on my self. 

After a year we started talking again as friends he made it clear that if i felt something for him is best to not be friends and i said okay however i knew i still had feelings but i respected how he felt so i was gonna accept being his friend and potentially seeing him with someone else while having him in my life because i love him but i was never going disclose how i felt. Fast forward everytime we talked on the phone our calls would last more than one hour sometimes we wpuld talk for 2 or 3 hours , text would have sexual jokes and when i asked if he wanted to go for a walk or go somewhere he would find an excused despite being the first one who said we will go for a coffee soon. Anyway one day i had enough so i confronted him about it and when he started to question me why i act like this i told him nothing will change so it dont matter if i say something. 

After sometime he pressured me so i confessed i still have feelings for him nothing changed and i never wanted to say anything because i didnt wanna make him uncomfortable. He went on a rage and told me im not a straight forward person and i tricked him and he hanged up which then made me angry and we had a fight via texts with insults and then he blocked me. Its been 3 months after this and my anger went away after he insulted me i still love him. 
Sometimes i see him with my car on the road working ( he works for the municipality doing maintenance around my town). I hate that i love someone who probably doesn't care about me. Like im at the point of my life where i had enough he will probably never come back and i dont want to love him anymore and wonder if his okay.

Im mentally a strong person when it comes to getting over relationships i had a 4 year one and getting over him was much much more easy. This whole thing accounting the time we first started talking and seeing each other up to now lasted 2 years i should be over him by now.

Im at the end of my rope. 
What can i do to get over him ?
I want him back but i know its wrong to want someone who treated me like this.

Tldr: i cant get over a guy i got involved with and gave me hope for the future its been 2 years now.

This feels like one of those times…

I (27F) met my boyfriend, Steven (41M) about two years ago. My twin brother, Ollie (27M) is a local musician and we lived at our mom’s house, so I’d often hang out with him and his musician friends. Ollie and I are super close, so we usually include each other among our friends.

When Steven first started coming around (summer 2023) I felt instantly drawn to him. He has such a kind and genuine energy about him and was so easy to talk to. Every time he would be over, I’d be sure to come down to the basement with weed or beers or something and chill for bit.

Over time we became friends, and around winter 2023, I started playing music with the two of them. I really liked jamming with them, but at the time I was also working full time and going to the gym 3-5 times per week so I ended up quitting the band (late spring 2024) because I didn’t have the amount of time that my brother expected me to put in for practice/jams etc. Ending the band wasn’t really a big deal for any of us and we all continued to hang out as usual, I even ended up becoming friends with the guy who took my place when I left.

I’d always go to any of Ollie’s shows, so when Steven was playing too we’d always end up smoking together at some point in the night just to get the chance to talk and catch up. One night, probably around 4th of July, 2024, there was a baseball game across the way from the venue and we could see fireworks from our usual smoking spot. I remember, Steven and I shared some real chemistry that day because that night I couldn’t stop thinking about him. The next day, he asked me out on Instagram. I wanted to say yes, but I lived with my mom and my brother and he was 41, so I told him it was a bad idea.

I didn’t see Steven much once I got my own place in November 2024, since although Ollie moved with me, it was a condo so they practiced elsewhere after that. I missed seeing him around, and I thought about him every now and then, sometimes sending little Instagram memes and what not. Then, one night in January 2025, I was out at a local spot with my brother’s girlfriend for a girls night. We got some drinks and were just walking around the venue, when I saw Steven kind of walking in our direction. Immediately, I was so excited to see him. I yelled “Steven!” with a big grin on my face and we ended up hanging out with him for a bit, and stuck around to watch his band play.

The whole night, I had butterflies. I was just so happy to have run into him after all this time, and I had any own place now, so I felt more comfortable with dating an older man. At this point, I had a goal to kiss him that night. So, after hanging out all night, smoking in my car, and then walking him to his car, he hadn’t given me any oppurtunity. I’d rejected him before, so I know he was trying to be respectful. But as I was walking back to my car, he pulled up beside me and offered me a ride the 20 meters or so to my car. I was so relieved that I had another chance, so I got in the car and when he pulled up to mine, I told him I was so happy to run into him, and that I had a great time, and I kissed him.

After that, we started dating within a couple of weeks and we were going strong for 6 months. But then, I started having some thoughts. Our relationship was full of love, and he was thoughtful and intimate and kind. The emotional connection between us was real. But it was other things that bothered me that I had a hard time articulating to myself and barely communicated to him. First, the age gap. It doesn’t bother me normally, but I noticed that when I would tell acquaintances about it, they would look at me with what looks like a mix of judgement and concern. And that started to get to me. Also, he was married for 10 years (she cheated and divorced him 2 years prior to us meeting). He has two beautiful children (4F and 7M) who I have grown very close with over the one day a week he has them. I knew all of this from the time we were friends before, and I didn’t think it would bother me, but as our relationship grew more serious, it did start to make me feel jealous of what he had. He doesn’t talk about his ex-wife much unless something specific was going on or he needed to vent, but it’s other little things like when he’s reminiscing about other places he lived and the words “our house” come out of his mouth. I never would say anything, because I didn’t want to seem jealous of his past and especially of something that doesn’t even exist anymore, but I think it built up in me. Also, because of his child support payments and his low income job, I started to think about the potential security I would be losing out on if I married him as opposed to some other imaginary guy with money.

I started to become afraid that I would end up resenting him for all of these things which he can’t control. And instead of talking to him and bringing these things up in a conversation, after about a month of thinking to myself, I broke up with him.

This was last Sunday morning. I was up all night, kind of stressing but no real concrete thoughts, and when he woke up, I pretty much just told him we should break up. It was awful. We both cried a lot, we had coffee together and talked and cried for a couple hours, and then he grabbed all his stuff and left for his day with the kids alone.

I was heartbroken. And almost immediately regretful. I tried telling myself I was being smart and thinking about my future, but the truth was I was just letting fear and other peoples judgements push me to make this big decision. I sat in my thoughts all day and that night I sent a small “hope you’re okay” text and he responded with a pic of the kids from the day and said that he was processing everything.

The next day I went to work (late because I’m not a robot) and then went to my mom’s after for someone to talk to. On my way out, I noticed a letter under my windshield wiper. I opened it up to see who it was from and it was from Steven. I immediately started sobbing and went back into my mom’s house. I read it, and she read it, and I cried some more and then left. The letter was so thoughtful. He said he appreciated our time together, and that my love for him was so special. And that he still was holding on to the idea of the beautiful life we could have had together.

I stopped at a gas station a few minutes from my mom’s house and called him. I asked him when he gave me the letter, and he said he drove to my house that morning and left it on my car. I asked him if I could come over and he said yes. We got back together that night.

Now it’s Saturday, about 6 days after we got back together. Tomorrow is his day with the kids and I’m so excited to see them again. But it’s also his stepmoms (their nanas) birthday so the whole family will be there. I know his dad and brother know we broke up because he was calling them the whole time. They know we are back together now, but I’m so embarrassed.

I don’t want them to think I’m not reliable or trustworthy or a bad person. I know they probably won’t bring it up but it’s so embarrassing and I feel terrible. I’ve felt pretty guilty all week. How do people heal after a breakup and getting back together? Steven isn’t mad at me, and I’ve explained to him everything I said here. I’ve apologized profusely and he’s accepted every time.

I guess the only way to feel better is to just keep going and over time it will be a little hiccup in the early days of our relationship. I just can’t help but worry that something like this would have destroyed his faith that I love him. I can’t imagine how much it would hurt if the same happened to me… he’s aware that the things I was feeling aren’t trivial and he says he forgives me but I can’t really forgive myself.

And the worst part is, all the things that upset me about the relationship are still there. I’ve just decided that our love is worth all of it. He says he wishes I would have just talked to him about it and I agree. I just don’t know where to go from here and how to emotionally prepare for tomorrow.

Anyways, I’m sorry if this was rambling. I just have a lot to get of my chest. Thank you to anyone that reads this, and any and all advice and comments are appreciated.

TL; DR

I (27F) broke up with my boyfriend (41M) of 7 months because I was uncomfortable about how other people judge our age gap and was worried about his financial stability. 
I changed my mind and got back with him the next day because I realized what a special connection we have and that everything in our emotional and physical relationship is wonderful. 
Now I feel guilty for not having a conversation with him first and instead jumping straight to a breakup and I am worried that he will have lost a certain amount of faith in me and my feelings for him. 
But, I am also worried because all of the same fears and insecurities are still there and in order to move forward and improve our relationship, I need to find a way to work through it in a healthy way. ",3,1755369646.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

When we started talking 5 months ago, she mentioned she was in a relationship and we kept conversing, I told her I just want to be her friend and would like to get coffee with her sometime and to let me know when she'll be free for it. 

Didn't see her at the gym for a few weeks and when she resumed last week, we talked for a while and she said she was resting. Then she said we should meet tomorrow for a drink. It's a casual meet, I know as it's at a cafe close to the gym which we both know. 

My nerves come from not knowing how to steer the conversation. Also important to note that she doesn't speak English and my Spanish is about a 5-6/10 so I won't be able to speak as freely or with as much nuance as I would if it were English.

1ms3ru8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1ms3ru8/success_story_90_percent_better/,Success Story- 90 percent better,"I told myself that if I ever got this under control I would make a post about it.  There were a lot of times when things felt pretty dark and it always helped me to see other people's success stories- they also provided a lot of tips for things I could try as well.  I tried so so many things, some worked to varying degrees, some did not work, for some the side effects were too bad to continue.  I'll go through everything I tried and how it worked for me, as well as what ultimately got me to where I am today.

I've had flare ups in the past, but they always went away in a couple of weeks through the use of OG Zantac (rantinidine) or Pepsid (famotidine) after Zantac was taken off shelves.  This last one did not go away- globus feeling, sore throat when waking up, throat clearing, sometimes a little regurgitation into the back of my mouth, throat burning, minty feeling in the back of my mouth, voice became weak or hoarse.  After 1.5 months of no improvement during which I involuntarily lost 10 lbs, I found this subreddit and in desperation started trying everything I could to get this under control.

**Pepcid (famotidine)** - I found this to both be less effective than the OG Zantac (ranitidine) and gave me worse side effects.  After taking it for a couple of weeks I had to stop as one day it felt like I was legitimately going to have a heart attack.  I checked and other people have had similar issues with it although seems rare. 

**Prilosec (omeprozole)** - had to stop this after one day as the side effects were so bad- felt like I took some kind of upper, couldn't sleep, felt like I was going to have a heart attack.

**Nexium** - the side effects of this were less but still significant.  Stopped after a week because it was both not effective and the side effects were not improving/getting worse.

**OG Zantac (ranitidine)** - I found a post where someone mentioned that OG Zantac with ranitidine was once again being sold in Australia!  This used to work so well for me with zero side effects that in desperation I managed to order it from a Australian online pharmacy.  It was expensive and took a few weeks to arrive, but worked better than Pepcid for me and thankfully still without the side effects.  However, while this could be a lifesaver after a bad meal it was not a cure and I did not get better from taking it, it just helped tame the worst of my symptoms.

**Trigger foods/low acid diet** - I wasn't desperate enough to go full low acid diet so I focused on my trigger foods.  Spicy foods, citrus, raw garlic, spearmint, chocolate, tomato sauce, coffee were the worst offenders, although thankfully I could still tolerate fatty foods and  tomato dishes if they were recipes that diluted them with cream etc.  I cut down on coffee but could not bring myself to stop altogether- just ate a small breakfast beforehand and added lots of oak milk (used to drink it black and skip breakfast).  Avoiding trigger foods helped prevent the worst symptoms.

**Smaller meals** - this was an absolute necessity- regurgitating into the back of your mouth because you ate too much is not an experience I want to have again.  This was just a baseline requirement to even begin getting better.

**No meals 3-4 hours before bedtime** - another thing that is just a baseline necessity- hated waking up with a sore throat if I didn't do this.  One time woke up in the middle of the night with symptoms so bad I had to take an emergency Pepcid even though I stopped taking them because of side effects.

**Wedge pillow** - I hated sleeping on this but it definitely helped with the morning sore throat.

**Exercise** - People seemed mixed on exercising on this sub, some thinks it helps and others think it makes things worse.  I wasn't going to give up running and weight lifting because of this, I don't think it made things worse but it also did not really make things better.  It did seem that after exercising my symptoms would be less for a few hours afterwards.

**Alkaline water** - this made a huge and immediate difference in my burning throat.  I think this is where my healing journey really began as getting the pepsin in my throat deactivated was a necessary step to even begin.  It was such a relief, I had gotten so used to the burning that I didn't even realize how bad it was until it was gone (not totally but still a huge difference).

**Claritin** - Did not help for me.

**Tums** - did not help AT ALL, not even for brief relief.

**Reflux Gourmet** - This could be really effective, but never lasted more than 1 to 1.5 hours for me before symptoms started returning.  I did like their single use travel packs though as I could carry it in my pocket and use it on go as needed.

**UK Gaviscon Advance** - this stuff was so great.  Truly effective and would last for 2-3 hours.  Great before you go to bed.  Only problem was very inconvenient to use anywhere other than home with the unwieldy glass bottles and measuring cup.  Also had to time when I took it as I take other medication and it can affect how that other medication gets absorbed if you take it too close to each other.  Did not try the tablets but that might have been good on the go.

**LES strengthening exercises** - I could never tell if these worked or not.  TBH I was trying so many different interventions at this point it is hard to tell which was causing the improvement I was feeling and which was a placebo.  Still, these are really easy so no reason not to try.

**Melatonin** - Another thing that I could not tell if it worked or not as I was trying so many things at this point.  I only took 1 mg instead of the 3 mg used in the study as 3 mg would make me really groggy in the morning and my job requires me to be very alert early.  But this is pretty harmless and makes for a great night's sleep so no harm in trying.  I am pretty sensitive to it, 3 mg might be no big deal for others.

**Probiotic pills** - I was really skeptical of these but they really seemed to work!  Gave me a few hours of relief usually.  I would take them morning and night as I found that to be more effective but YMMV.  If I had bad symptoms after a meal a combination of Zantac, probiotics and Gaviscon would set me right.

*********All of this together over a couple of months got me to 60-70 percent better, which was a huge improvement but I still had to be careful about what I ate (although much less careful than when I started) and would still get flare ups after a bad meal or series of meals.  It still felt like 90 percent of my mental energy went to thinking about my LPR- how were my symptoms at that moment, what was I going to eat, when did I last take medicine, what should I take next and when- always had my hand on my throat feeling it.  So less miserable than when I started but still pretty miserable.  What finally got me to 90 percent was:

**Pantoprazole** - finally got an appointment with a gastro.  He was pretty dismissive of LPR (says its all just GERD) and didn't believe some of the side effects I had had on other PPIs.  But he suggested trying pantoprazole as it was considered milder than other PPIs.  And it worked! Symptom relief started fast and just kept improving.  Side effects were pretty minimal and lessened after a couple of weeks.  I can now eat anything I want for the most part, although I still try to not eat 3-4 hours before bedtime, eat smaller meals, and still cut my coffee with oat milk and a small breakfast.  I have been on it about a month, doctor said to stay on it for another 3 months then we can try to wean off of it at that point- hopefully my LES etc will be healed by then.  Got my life back!

So yeah... all that and what worked was just a PPI.  If one PPI doesn't work for you or had bad side effects I suggest trying others- you may find one that is a good fit.  For everything else, they legitimately work to some degree- just not sure if they are going to get you back to 90+ percent better, will probably take a lot longer, and come with a lot more dietary restrictions.  Still, this subreddit and all the suggestions saved me for the months before I had an appointment with the gastro and found pantoprazole- I was even able to go to Japan and not have my trip ruined/eat most of what I wanted while I was there pre-PPI.  So thank you all, and I hope this write up helps someone else that is feeling hopeless the way that I was back when this first began.",2,1755369560.0,LPR,2,0.75,False
1ms3rj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1ms3rj2/reveal_why_the_best_french_press_coffee_maker/,Reveal Why the Best French Press Coffee Maker ESPRO P7 Stands Out,"Real coffee enthusiasts know the joy of brewing the perfect cup, and that’s exactly where the ESPRO 1032C2 P7 excels. I’ve spent the past several mornings testing this polished stainless steel French press, and it has been a treat. Before diving into my experience, let me set the scene: if you've ever been frustrated by coffee sludge or lukewarm brews, this sleek coffee maker might just be your new best friend.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker doesn’t feel like your typical French press. Its polished stainless steel design shouts sophistication and durability. The double-walled insulated body not only looks impressive on the counter but also helps keep your brew hot for much longer than glass alternatives. It has a sturdy, well-balanced weight in your hands, which says a lot about its build quality. Unlike flimsy models I’ve tried in the past, this French press feels like it could survive daily use—and perhaps even the occasional clumsy morning drop. Its dimensions (6.37"" D x 4.68"" W x 10.4"" H) make it substantial but not overly bulky, so storage isn’t an issue.

**Ease of Use**  
Operating the ESPRO P7 was refreshingly simple. You put in your coffee grounds, add hot water, give it a quick stir, and let the press work its magic. What stands out here is the reusable double micro-mesh filter system. I've brewed everything from classic French roast to light Ethiopian blends, and each cup was flawlessly smooth. The filters genuinely deliver on their promise of grit-free coffee without robbing it of the rich oils that bring out flavor. I even made tea to test its versatility, and it worked beautifully.

**Good Points**  
- Double micro-mesh filter system ensures a grit-free, smooth cup of coffee.  
- Double-walled stainless steel keeps the coffee hot for extended periods.  
- Stylish and durable design feels premium and sturdy in daily use.  

[Time to see ESPRO 1032C2 P7 cost on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b011wtmh4o/)

**Performance and Brewing Experience**  
With its capacity to brew up to 32 ounces of coffee (enough for a small group or one serious caffeine lover, like me), this French press doesn’t just perform; it excels. The heat retention is particularly noteworthy. After finishing a first cup, I found the coffee still hot when I returned 20 minutes later—impressively close to its initial temperature. The double filter didn’t let a single coffee ground sneak through, which honestly spoiled me. Drinking from this French press feels like stepping into your favorite café, minus the commute and barista.

**Shortcomings**  
- Fairly heavy compared to glass French presses, which could be a downside for some users.  
- The polished steel exterior is prone to fingerprint marks, so regular wiping is necessary to maintain its shine.  

**Ideal User**  
This coffee maker feels like it’s tailored for coffee enthusiasts who value quality over convenience. If you’re someone who loves savoring a perfectly brewed morning coffee without rushing, this French press delivers every single time. That said, it might feel like overkill if you casually brew coffee once a week or don’t care much about minimizing sediment or maintaining heat.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other high-end French presses, such as the Bodum Chambord and Fellow Clara, the ESPRO P7 holds its own well. The Bodum model is notably more affordable but doesn't match ESPRO’s heat retention or the double micro-filter system. Fellow Clara, on the other hand, competes closely with its stylish design and heat-insulating abilities, albeit at a similar premium price point. Still, the standout advantage of the ESPRO lies in its near-perfect ability to eliminate sludge and maintain your coffee’s smoothness. If performance and durability are priorities, the ESPRO outshines most of its rivals.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering the premium materials, excellent heat retention, and consistent results, the ESPRO French press feels like a worthwhile investment. Sure, there are cheaper French presses out there, but few offer the reliability and craftsmanship of this one. I’d argue that you’re paying not just for a coffee maker, but for the consistent experience of café-quality coffee at home. For those on a budget, this might feel like a splurge, but for any devoted coffee aficionado, it’s worth every penny.

# Best Light Roast Coffees 2025: Expert Reviews & Guide

Light roast coffee has experienced a surge in popularity amongst coffee aficionados. This trend is largely due to the growing appreciation for nuanced flavors and brighter acidity that light roasts offer, compared to their darker counterparts.They retain more of the bean’s original characteristics, conveying a unique taste influenced directly by the origin and processing methods. For consumers seeking a vibrant and complex coffee experience, navigating the sea of available light roasts can be daunting; therefore, this guide aims to present expert reviews and recommendations to help you discover the best light roast coffees available in 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

Light roast coffees distinguish themselves through specific processing techniques and resulting bean characteristics that ultimately impact the coffee's flavor profile.

**Acidity Level:** Light roast coffees are defined by their high acidity, which can range from a crisp, citrus-like tang to a more delicate, fruity tartness. This acidity is due to the shorter roasting time, preserving more of the naturally occurring acids within the bean, notably chlorogenic acid. The perceived acidity is influenced by factors like growing elevation and bean variety, with higher altitude coffees ofen exhibiting brighter, more complex acidity.

**Flavor Complexity:** These coffees offer a greater range of flavors compared to darker roasts,exhibiting intricate notes of fruit,floral hints,and even subtle herbal tones.The roasting process for light roasts is carefully controlled to a lower temperature, halting before the sugars within the bean caramelize extensively. This helps preserve lighter and more delicate aromatics that would be burned off in more intensive processes.

**Body and Mouthfeel:** Light roasts frequently enough have a lighter body,which refers to the tactile sensation of the coffee in your mouth,leaning toward a tea-like or delicate mouthfeel. This is often described in terms of a brightness that dances on the palate.Although some find this less ‘substantial’, devotees value the lightness, which allows the underlying flavors to come through more vibrantly and clearly.

**Caffeine Content:** In general, light roast coffees tend to have a slightly higher caffeine content compared to darker roasts. This is because the longer roasting time of darker roasts can break down some of the caffeine molecules. However, differences in caffeine content are also affected by the variety of coffee bean and the brewing method used to prepare the coffee.

**Origin & Processing Method Transparency:** Many roasters who specialize in light roasts are meticulous about providing detailed data about the origin of their beans, including the specific farm and the processing methods used. This transparency helps consumers appreciate the unique characteristics resulting from these choices, thereby connecting flavor profiles to meticulous sourcing and production. Fully washed, natural process and honey process beans are common.

**Bean Density and Roast Consistency:** Light roasts should exhibit consistent roasting throughout, displaying an even color and avoiding visual signs of scorching or uneven development. High-density beans respond especially well to light roasting, delivering the clarity and complexity that light roast lovers demand. Look for whole beans that are uniform, with no meaningful cracks or oiliness on the surface.

## Core Benefits

Choosing light roast coffee means opting for a distinct experience that accentuates the bean’s unique characteristics.

**Unique Flavor Profile:** Light roast coffees open the door to an array of flavors not typically found in darker roasts. For example, you might experience notes of bergamot and honeysuckle in an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, or bright, citrusy notes in a Kenyan coffee. This offers consumers an prospect to explore a wide palette of flavor profiles, driven by the origin and processing of the bean.

**Enhanced Acidity and Brightness:** The higher acidity in light roast coffees offers a lively and refreshing experience. Instead of the bitter aftertaste often associated with darker roasts, light roasts often leave a clean, crisp finish, which can be particularly enjoyable when iced or during warmer months. The brightness wakes up the senses.**Greater Caffeine Kick:** Thanks to their relatively short roasting time, light roasts preserve more of the bean's caffeine content. This provides an invigorating start to the day, and is also a popular pick-me-up for those needing sustained focus and alertness without relying on artificial stimulants.

**Highlighting Sourcing Transparency:** Light roasts often come with detailed information about the coffee's origin, processing methods, and even the specific farm or cooperative where it was grown. This transparency empowers consumers to make informed choices and support ethical and sustainable coffee production practices, thereby aligning their purchases with personal values.

**Versatility in Brewing Methods:** While light roasts can be prepared through various brewing methods, they particularly shine when using pour-over systems, French presses, or cold brew. These methods allow the nuanced flavors and delicate aromas to fully express themselves, resulting in a richer and more complex cup of coffee. Experimenting with different brewing parameters can further enhance the experience.

## FAQs Section

**What brewing methods are best suited for light roast coffees?**
Light roast coffees shine brightest with brewing methods that allow for greater precision and control over extraction. Pour-over methods like Hario V60 or Chemex are excellent choices,as they allow you to fine-tune parameters like water temperature,grind size,and pour rate. French presses and cold brew methods also yield satisfying results, accentuating the coffee's fruity notes and delicate acidity.

**How does grind size affect the taste of light roast coffees?**
Grind size plays a crucial role in extracting the full potential of light roast coffees. A finer grind can lead to over-extraction, resulting in bitterness, while a coarser grind may lead to under-extraction and a weak, sour taste. The ideal grind size depends on the brewing method, but generally, a medium-fine to medium grind is recommended for pour-over methods, while a coarse grind is best for French press.

**What water temperature should I use for brewing light roast coffees?**
Water temperature is a critical factor that affects the extraction of flavors from light roast coffees. Optimal water temperature typically ranges from 195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C). Using water that is too hot can scorch the grounds,leading to bitterness,while water that is too cool may not extract the full range of flavors. Use a thermometer to ensure accurate water temperature.**How does the age of the coffee beans affect the taste?**
Freshness is paramount when it comes to light roast coffees. Coffee beans begin to lose their aroma and flavor shortly after roasting. Thus, it is indeed recommended to consume light roast coffees within 2-4 weeks of the roast date for the best possible flavor and aroma. Store the beans in an airtight container in a cool,dark place to preserve their freshness.

Thought I'd give this a try and put myself out there. :)

A little bit about me: 

• My idea of a perfect day would be trying out a nice restaurant along with seeing a movie at the theatre. I am a bit of a foodie and love exploring new places. Though I also love a nice time indoors like watching a movie at home, reading a book, writing & learning new recipes to cook. 

• I am ambitious and am thankful to say I am in a field I am passionate about. That being said I love simplicity and find comfort in routine, whether it be going for walks, getting coffee, or catching the sunset by the pier.

• Some of my all time favorite movies are ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Dodgeball"", and my favorite shows are ""The Simpsons"", ""Family Guy"" and ""The Good Place"" Always open to new movie and TV show suggestions! For the holiday season, my go-to movie is ""It's A Wonderful Life""

I have a Fellow Ode Gen 2 and also a Baratza Encore. The Ode 2 is what I use daily and I really enjoy the coffee it produces more than the Encore. I need something that will grind for a moka pot, pour over, drip, percolator, Chemex, up to French Press / cold brew. It doesn’t need to grind for espresso because I don’t have an espresso machine, but if it does that’s fine as long as it works well with filter. I like light roast, medium, and dark roasts with medium being what I use the most. I ended up buying the Timemore CS3 Pro and from what little I’ve used it, I enjoy the coffee it makes. The main reason I am considering the S3 and K Ultra is the adjustment ring on the outside. Changing the grind setting on the CS3 is a pain because there’s no way to know where you’re at except dialing all the way back to zero and starting over. I’d prefer an adjustment where I can visually see where I am and easily switch between grind sizes. I paid around $80 for the CS3 Pro and am also wondering if the other two are worth the significant increase in price (especially the K Ultra). As of now, I’m leaning toward the S3 because of the balance between quality and price. I should also mention that I’m NOT looking for ultra clarity focused burrs where the coffee is more tea like.

Designed for adults, it boasts some impressive features like a 750W peak brushless motor, a removable 480Wh battery, and the ever-important dual-disc brakes for confident stopping power. As someone who commutes daily and enjoys weekend trails, this blend of practicality and performance intrigued me. My experience with the bike isn’t without its quirks, but it left me with plenty to talk about.

**A Slick Design and Build Quality That Turns Heads**  
From the moment I unboxed this electric bike, I could tell it had been designed with thought and precision. The aluminum frame is both lightweight and robust, making it sturdy enough to handle bumpy roads or uneven trails. Plus, the sleek blue finish stands out in a sea of black and grey frames. It’s a real head-turner, whether parked at the coffee shop or cruising down the bike path. The 27.5-inch tires feel solid and puncture-resistant, which I appreciated after running over some debris with no issue. The adjustable ergonomic seat? Surprisingly comfortable, even for longer rides. However, the bike's weight at 52.9 pounds makes lifting it onto a rack a bit of a workout. It’s something worth considering if you plan to transport it often.  

**Performance That Packs a Punch**  
The heart of this bike is its robust 750W peak motor. It delivers plenty of grunt for everyday rides, conquering inclines with ease and maintaining a steady 22 MPH top speed. On one particularly hilly route, I felt like I was cheating. The 7-speed Shimano gearing paired with the motor ensures you never feel overexerted. The bike’s front suspension fork absorbs shocks well, making for a smoother ride on trails or pothole-riddled streets. 

[Grab Heybike RM27.5 at the best price on Amazon.](https://rulse.com/p/b0ccxt9zcp/)  

**Battery Life That Doesn’t Disappoint**  
On to one of the bike’s standout features – the 480Wh removable battery. I’ve tested its range thoroughly and found that it performs as advertised. On a mix of pedal assist and pure electric mode, I managed about 38 miles on a single charge. Fully recharging the battery took around six hours, which might feel lengthy for some, but the overcharge protection adds peace of mind if you leave it plugged in overnight. Removing the battery is straightforward, locking firmly in place when attached to the frame. Carrying it upstairs for charging didn’t strain me either. For those contemplating longer rides or commutes, the battery does well, though having a second one on hand might come in clutch for extended adventures.

**Control and Riding Modes**  
The Heybike RM27.5 offers four riding modes that fit different needs. I predominantly used PAS (pedal assist) Mode for my daily commute, adjusting levels 1 to 3 depending on how much—or little—effort I wanted. Pure Electric Mode, where you simply twist the throttle, became my guilty pleasure on lazy afternoons. There’s also a combination mode for extended trips and Pedal Mode if you’re feeling traditional. The twist throttle is responsive, and the smart LCD display is easy to read even under direct sunlight, giving me all the crucial stats during rides. One gripe? If you’re switching modes mid-ride, it takes a couple of seconds to adjust.

**Strengths**  
• Sturdy yet stylish build with puncture-resistant tires.  
• Powerful motor and reliable suspension for diverse terrains.  
• Impressive battery life with easy removal and charging.  
• Four customizable riding modes for various cycling preferences.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
• The bike is on the heavier side, affecting portability.  
• Charging time might feel long for some users.  
• Mode adjustments have a slight delay.  

**Competing Products**  
While the Heybike RM27.5 shines in its category, there are comparable electric bikes to consider. One of its key competitors is the RadRover 6 Plus, which also boasts a robust motor and solid frame. However, the RadRover’s higher price point and slightly longer charging time may steer value-conscious buyers toward Heybike’s offering. Another is the Aventon Aventure, known for its impressive range and superior hill-climbing capabilities, yet it lacks some of the Heybike’s ease-of-use features like quick battery removal and beginner-friendly riding modes. Ultimately, Heybike offers a nice balance of affordability, power, and convenience, suiting newbies and seasoned riders alike.  

**Cost Performance That Hits the Mark**  
In terms of bang for the buck, the Heybike RM27.5 delivers solid returns on investment. Its combination of premium features like a high-performance motor, durable build, and versatile riding options feels thoughtful for its price bracket. While some competitors may offer slightly more tech-savvy extras, such as advanced app integration or finer drivetrain adjustments, they often come with a steeper cost. This bike manages to maintain a fair price-to-quality ratio without skimping on essential safety and functionality features, making it a genuinely smart spending choice for those venturing into the electric bike category.

1ms3jiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1ms3jiq/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_from_chantal_mia/,Explore the Best Electric Kettle from Chantal Mia and Is It Worth It,"Having tested the Chantal ELSL37-03R Mia electric water kettle personally over the past few weeks, I can confidently share my overall experience with this sleek and compact kitchen companion. As a coffee and tea enthusiast, I’m always on the lookout for appliances that not only perform but add a touch of elegance to my countertop. This electric kettle, with its stunning matte blue Ryder finish, checked both those boxes, but it wasn’t without its quirks. Here's how it fared during my everyday use.

**Elegant and Thoughtful Design**  
The Mia electric kettle has an aesthetic charm that instantly draws your eye. Its compact size makes it ideal for kitchens low on counter space or for setups where portability is key. The all-steel interior construction is on-point for those seeking a BPA-free and non-toxic build, ensuring no off-flavors seep into the water. I enjoyed the ergonomic handle, which felt sturdy and comfortable, even when pouring at a precise angle. Coupled with the patented dual-function spout, it made preparing pour-over coffee feel like an art. The spout design is particularly worth mentioning because it doesn't just look good; it cools boiling water to the perfect temperature of 205°F for the best coffee brewing, which is every barista-at-home’s dream.

[Check Chantal ELSL37-03R Mia electric kettle price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b0944bql4c/)

**Performance and Versatility**  
The Mia eKettle won me over with its quiet yet quick heating capabilities, thanks to the 1000W base. It efficiently boiled enough water for my morning tea in no time. Whether whipping up oatmeal for rushed mornings or sterilizing my niece's baby bottle, this kettle proved to be a versatile assistant. The automatic shut-off safety feature kicked in silently every time the water reached boiling point, and the boil-dry protection was a reassuring touch. That said, while it’s great at heating water quickly, I noticed that it’s sized for smaller households given its 32-ounce capacity—something to consider if you find yourself entertaining often or need larger quantities at once.

**Upsides**  
- High-quality food-grade stainless-steel construction, free from harmful chemicals.  
- Dual-function spout for controlled slow-pour coffee brewing or a faster pour when needed.  
- Compact and lightweight for easy portability, weighing just 2.3 pounds.  
- Multiple safety: Auto shut-off, boil-dry protection, and intuitive indicator light.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Quirks were minimal, but they did pop up during my testing.  
- The painted finish, while beautiful, felt a bit prone to scratches with frequent use.  
- There's no adjustable temperature control, which would’ve been a perfect addition for tea aficionados who like their brews at specific temps.  
- The cord length wasn’t particularly generous, which limited placement options without an extension nearby.  

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing the Mia kettle with some market challengers like the Cosori Electric Kettle or Fellow’s Stagg EKG, distinctions became apparent. The sleek but minimalistic design of the Fellow Stagg wins purely from a visual standpoint and offers precise temperature control—but at a much steeper price point. Conversely, the Cosori’s larger capacity proves useful for families but falls short in achieving the elegance and premium feel of Mia’s matte finish. While those alternatives shine in their respective niches, Mia strikes a balance between aesthetic appeal and efficiency in smaller households. However, adding a couple of extra features, like variable temperature, could future-proof this already solid product.

**Affordable Quality**  
When stacked against competitors, this kettle offers stellar value for its unique mix of performance and artisanal design. It isn’t trying to be the most advanced, nor overly luxurious; instead, it focuses on nailing simplicity in style. It’s at that sweet spot for someone wanting more than just a functional kettle yet isn’t willing to break the bank. It feels like a smart investment for tea and coffee lovers who prioritize compact yet efficient appliances for daily use. For those who like a bit of flair with their functionality, this kettle justifies itself without feeling excessive.

During the flight, the woman’s plane appears to crash, but it’s later revealed that it didn’t actually go down—it was stolen—and she is ultimately exposed as a traitor. Alongside this plot runs the perspective of a detective or investigator who is a bit of a jerk, constantly smoking and drinking black coffee, and who is the one to uncover the truth about the supposed crash. Early in the story, when arriving at the building where he will be working, this detective makes a flirtatious remark about a woman’s perfume.

—I saw this money fall from their table when they left. I thought I should give it back to him.

[Adrien and Marinette freeze, surprised. She smiles enigmatically and leaves.]

Adrien (thinking, intrigued):
—Do I know her from somewhere...?

Marinette (whispering to herself):
—I also feel that… I've seen her before…

[Adrien hands the money to the waiter.]

Waiter (relieved):
-Thank you. I thought I was going to have to pay for it myself.

Adrien and Marinette (in unison, with a smile):
—Sorry for everything.

[They leave together, still a little nervous but with obvious complicity. The camera lingers for a moment at the cafe door, showing in the distance the silhouette of the mysterious woman disappearing into the crowd.]

I have endometriosis, PCOS, high cortisol and some general hormone issues, so I’m usually pretty strict with my diet. I don’t introduce new foods often, and when I do, I try to watch how they impact my cycle. Does anyone else have foods that stop their periods?

A few years back, I lost my period for over a year while eating eggs regularly. When I went vegan for a while, my period came back, and I assumed it was because of being vegan. Later, I had to reintroduce animal products (digestive issues), and eggs were one of the first things I added back. Not long after, my period disappeared again.

More recently, I tested this more specifically. When I eat egg yolks, I lose my period. But when I only eat egg whites, my period stays regular. This has been consistent a few times now.

Coffee has a similar effect — if I drink caffeine regularly, I lose my period.

So I guess my questions are:

Has anyone else had egg yolks or coffee mess with their cycle like this?

Any idea why egg yolks specifically would have such a strong impact while the whites don’t?

Does anyone else have weird foods that stop their periods?

Then a month ago, she came to watch a show I was in unannounced. I was so shocked. I unblocked her to say please dont show up to my work like that again.

The conversation grew, and she apologised for how things went, she felt deep regret, and said she came to show support and that we should have a conversation. 

We ended up meeting for a coffee and she said she still loved me, hasn’t been with anyone since, thinks about me everyday but cannot be with me as shes just booked a job and “too many blessings have come to her life being single.”

We ended up having sex and I stayed the night. It was incredibly romantic but now we are back to no contact.

I got so hopeful guys. I told her where I stood and that I was willing to try again.

I feel awful and so confused, I just don’t get why she reappeared in my life if she didn’t want to stay. I’m praying she changes her mind but I cant wait on it, please help me get some insight or decide if I should block her again?

I have endometriosis, PCOS, and some general hormone issues, so I’m usually pretty strict with my diet. I don’t introduce new foods often, and when I do, I try to watch how they impact my cycle. Does anyone else have foods they can’t eat that impact their cycles?

A few years back, I lost my period for over a year while eating eggs regularly. When I went vegan for a while, my period came back, and I assumed it was because of being vegan. Later, I had to reintroduce animal products (digestive issues), and eggs were one of the first things I added back. Not long after, my period disappeared again.

More recently, I tested this more specifically. When I eat egg yolks, I lose my period. But when I only eat egg whites, my period stays regular. This has been consistent a few times now.

Coffee has a similar effect — if I drink caffeine regularly, I lose my period.

So I guess my questions are:

Has anyone else had egg yolks or coffee mess with their cycle like this?

Any idea why egg yolks specifically would have such a strong impact while the whites don’t?

Does anyone else have weird foods that stop their periods?

I’ve been using this coffee maker for months now, and I can confidently say it brings something unique to the table. However, it’s not flawless, and if you’re considering adding this to your kitchen, there are a few quirks you should know.

**Elegant Design and Build Quality**  
This sleek drip coffee machine in matte silver immediately caught my eye when I unpacked it. The dimensions (6.5""D x 12.75""W x 14""H) make it a decent-sized machine for most kitchens, fitting snugly between my toaster and blender. Its solid construction feels durable, and knowing it's made in the Netherlands already gave me high hopes for longevity. The hotplate is a standout feature, keeping my coffee hot without burning it. However, I did notice that the matte exterior easily picks up fingerprints, which means there’s a fair bit of wiping involved to keep it looking pristine.  

**Brewing Performance**  
I have to highlight the impressive performance of this coffee maker. Brewing a full 40 oz pot of coffee in just 4–6 minutes is like magic for my busy mornings. Plus, it offers a selector switch to brew either a half or full carafe, adapting the brewing speed and hotplate temperature accordingly. Testing the half-carafe option proved just as efficient as the full one, and the coffee retained its robust flavor. The brew basket automatically pauses coffee flow when I remove the carafe—a thoughtful feature when I'm impatient to sneak the first sip.  

[Check Technivorm Moccamaster 53930 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b09nmx27xt/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Brew selector for half/full carafes enhances versatility.  
- Coffee stays within the ""golden cup standard"" temperature range.  
- The hotplate keeps coffee warm and drinkable for an extended time.  

**Operation and Ease of Use**  
One of the simplest coffee makers I’ve used, it runs entirely with a single switch. As someone who hates fiddling with too many settings before caffeine hits my brain, the no-fuss interface is a huge plus. The automatic shutoff after 100 minutes adds peace of mind for those of us prone to forgetfulness. That said, the lack of programmable functionality could annoy users who prefer having coffee ready as soon as they wake up.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The lack of a programmable timer limits convenience for early risers.  
- Being a premium coffee maker, it feels overpriced for the features it offers. Like, can an auto-shutoff justify this price tag?  
- Glass carafes are always a gamble for clumsy hands like mine—breakable and not the best at insulation.  

**Direct Competitors**  
Against its industry rivals, the Technivorm Moccamaster does stand out in quite a few ways. Comparing it to the Breville Precision Brewer, you’ll find Breville provides more brewing modes, including cold brew. However, the simplicity and consistent quality of the Technivorm brew process feel unmatched. On the other hand, a machine like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 gives you programmable features at a far more wallet-friendly price, but the coffee often lacks the richness I get from the Moccamaster. Its high build quality and precise engineering set it apart from typical drip machines, yet for those seeking customization, this might not hit the mark.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
This product sits firmly in the “premium” price bracket, and you're paying for the brand's reputation, reliability, and brewing precision. While it might feel steep, especially if you’re just stepping into the world of drip coffee machines, the results are undeniable. If you’re an ardent coffee enthusiast who values simplicity and taste above all else, this is worth every penny. However, for casual coffee drinkers or those on a tighter budget, there are cheaper alternatives that’ll make a decent cup of joe.

Sex: Female

Height: 5’8

Weight: 150 pound

Race: Asian

Duration of complaint: N/A

Location: Teeth

Any existing relevant medical issues: No

Current medications: Regular Crest Toothpaste



My understanding is that Sensodyne helps people with sensitive teeth because it creates a protective barrier over exposed dentin, and contains a higher fluoride concentration. My dentist said that they are not sure, but that they believe Sensodyne helps ""fill tubules"" (not sure what this means), but that this makes teeth ""less porous"" which may provide benefits against enamel erosion, bacteria getting into teeth, and/or teeth staining from coffee and red wine (""by better filling the holes in the teeth"" this ""stops chromagens (things that stain teeth) from getting in).



I believe this is why dentists often recommend that people doing teeth whitening with gels use sensodyne - since gels can weaken enamel and make tooth more porous, sensodyne use after whitening can help repair tooth (gel sort of opens teeth up to get chromagens out, then sensodyne plugs those pores that got opened up - similiar to how one washes their face with hot water to open pores, but then finishes with cold water when done to close pores back up to stop crap from getting in and causing acne).



So does this mean that its best to use Sensodyne as ones regular morning and nighttime toothpaste, since it better ""shields"" the teeth, when compared to regular toothpastes? So basically all potential upside with no potential downside - or would long-term use create negative side effects or teeth issues?

  
I did ask this question in the ""ask dentists"" sub as well. However, I am also asking here since I'm not sure if regular Sensodyne use would cause issues beyond just the mouth (e.g., maybe 24/7 sensodyne use over a year would cause stomach pain or other issues, due to small amounts one swallows) ",2,1755368513.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False

1ms38vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1ms38vy/cat_limping_only_to_me/,Cat Limping Only To Me,"So, one of our Siamese cats (12, male) limps at times and I’m trying to decide if I need to take him to the vet. He’s been doing this for a long time but he only limps to me - no one else.

I’ve meticulously watched and tracked his behaviour and have noted no change in his condition/limping, no change in behaviour or temperament (very affectionate and talkative), no change in eating habits, no change in sleeping habits, no change in using the litter box, no excessive vomiting, etc.

I’ve looked him all over, he has no visible injuries and he doesn’t wince or yelp when touch and/or apply any pressure anywhere. I’ve even set up security cameras around the house and I’ve watched him remotely to see if he limps at all when no one is around. He does not limp at all when no one is around but I do see him running around the house playing with our other cat. 

He doesn’t limp to anyone else, just me and it’s usually when he wants something - close attention or coffee cream (yes, I give him a little bit of cream once in a while). So, I’ll be making coffee, he limps to me looking all doughy eyed, then my spouse (his main person and the only variable that trumps everything, including me) calls him over, he quickly speed walks over, no limp, no signs, all affection and gratitude. We’ve done this multiple times over the last couple of months and it’s the same every time. 

Aside from this, there are a couple of important factors to know with this car because I think it matters in possibly explaining this behaviour:

1. He was born in a barn, the mother disappeared (no mother’s milk, no early learning and socialization). He was taken by teenaged girls and was raised by by hand from since before his eyes opened the first time. So, he doesn’t seem to think he’s a cat, but behaves more like a dog.
2. We had two medical incidents when I needed to care for him and nurse him back to health. The first time I observed changes in his behaviour. He was refusing food and drink and was just sitting in a corner, not interested in and wanting to do anything. I searched all over the house but figured it out within a couple of hours. He licked battery acid that leaked from a wireless keyboard and burned the first quarter of his tongue. He was hungry and getting dehydrated, and I hand fed him water and wet food with a syringe for a couple of days until it healed and he could eat independently. The second time, he was straining in the litter box and there were observable changes in his behaviour including hiding/not seeking attention, not eating or drinking. After several trips to the vet, and hand feeding, he passed a large (for him) hairball turd and everything went back to normal. I would say he almost died, but I had a lot of spare time at the time, and I put a ton of time into taking care of him.

I tend to think he’s fine and is really just seeking my attention, but there’s always potential for being wrong. I appreciate any insights people can provide. Let me know if you have questions.",1,1755368413.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False

A couple of years back during one of those trips, I (F) met someone (F). We only spent about 6 hours together total, talking, going to a party, and eventually sleeping together. She was in an open relationship but had never been with anyone outside her partner. I was single and had never had casual sex before. But that night was… magical. We explored our desires freely, and it felt like something clicked.

But the timing wasn’t right. Back home, I was starting to become serious with someone else (no commitments yet at the time), and a long-distance relationship didn’t make sense. We chatted and video called for a while after, but once I officially started courting my now-girlfriend, we stopped talking.

Last week, I traveled again to Kenya to close out the project. I reached out to her, and we met up for coffee. We talked honestly and gave each other closure. For her, closure had come two years ago when we stopped talking. For me, it only hit last week, the sadness and sense of loss, knowing the project was ending and that I’d likely never see her again.

We admitted that what we had was something special. That fleeting night had changed both of us, even if it never turned into something more. And while I’m now in a very happy relationship, saying goodbye forever to that connection still hurts.

It was the best closure we could give each other. But still… it feels bittersweet.",3,1755368324.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.81,False

He wasn’t sure which one he was when he found the euthanasia site—just that it offered him something reality hadn’t in years: a choice.

First instinct?
Maybe he’d trade the last photo of his parents, or the only memory that still made him feel anything—for a painless death. Maybe not.

Snorts. Has to be a joke.

Makes an account anyway. What’s there to lose? Job’s gone. Girlfriend evaporated. Parents? Dead. Living in a rotting house with mildew on the ceiling and a fridge that hums like it's on life support. He clicks on the wish form. Blank field. “Enter your final wish.”

Thinks.

Not ready to die. Not really. Not today. But also, nothing’s worth staying for.

Notification pops on his phone. Riot footage. Religion-fueled insanity again. One community throws stones; the other lights houses on fire. All because the Prime Minister made one of his half-baked supremacist speeches. Another push toward the Theocracy of Nationalism.

The next video shows the PM outright saying it. Clear as day. Smiling, proud. Declaring religious dominance. So much for plausible deniability. 

He exhales slowly. He wasn’t angry. Not really. Not political. Just tired. Tired of the noise, the fear, the pretending. Tired of being told to pick a side.

He thinks for a second, then types:

 “I wish the Prime Minister were dead tomorrow.”

He pauses. Not out of guilt—just muscle memory. The part of him that used to hesitate.

Who cares. The PM’s a fascist clown anyway. Always blaring his god-sent righteousness while the world burns.

He didn’t even hate religion. He wasn’t a savior. Just tired. Tired of this circus.  And honestly, if the PM croaked, maybe Twitter would finally find something else to scream about. 

Clicks submit. 

WARNING: This is your final consent to euthanasia.

He chuckles. “Sure. Like anyone’s gonna assassinate the Prime Minister just because some nobody typed something from his moldy mattress.”

Clicks confirm. The screen blinks. The world doesn't.

Checks the fridge. Spoiled milk. A couple of gray-stained eggs. Boils them. Chokes them down with the milk. Cereal’s gone too.

Another notification. “Your request will be fulfilled within 24 hours.”

Cute.

It’s 4 AM. Can’t sleep—again. Watches videos of assassinations. JFK. Gandhi. MLK. Headshots in broad daylight. History’s greatest plot twists.

Finally drifts off.

He’s flying. Above cities wrapped in fire. In the center of a flaming ring stand a group of people—untouched, tall, stoic. He dives lower. One of his arms morphs into a rifle. Long-range. Locked and loaded.

At the center: the Prime Minister. Radiating power, surrounded by sycophants.

He glides, hawk-like, calibrates the shot, pulls the trigger—BAM.

Awake. 5 AM. Drenched in sweat. Gulps water. The geyser’s dead—cold shower it is. It smacks him into full wakefulness.

Takes eight sleeping pills.

Drifts again.

Now he’s the one in the fire-ring. Everyone else burns outside it. Their arms stretch toward him, melting, fingers curling, faces blistering. He doesn’t move. Doesn’t help. Just watches.

There’s no sound.

Just flames and reaching arms and the soundless screams. It's quiet, too quiet. He lies down in the center. Closes his eyes. Lets the fire swirl. Darkness crawls in like an old friend.

Morning?

Maybe. Can’t tell. Newspapers cover every window. A half-baked solution to help him sleep.

He rolls off the bed. Dizzy. Throws up on the carpet. Again.

Wipes his face with a towel. It's worse than the carpet.

Phone buzzes. PM’s smug face on the screen. He scoffs. Wonders what stunt the man pulled now. Boils water. Makes a bitter black coffee. Sits in his busted lazy boy.

News headline:
""Prime Minister Dies Peacefully in His Sleep. Nation Mourns 15 Years of Glorious Service.""

He jolts. Sweats. Opens the site from last night. Logs in.

REQUEST COMPLETED.

He asked if I wanted to meet, and since I’m single, I thought why not. We planned a movie and then coffee afterward. He booked the movie tickets and paid for them. When we went for coffee, I offered to pay since he already covered the movie, but he didn’t let me.

After that, we sat and had a really nice, long chat. He then dropped me home. I texted him when I got home, and he replied when he reached too. He also thanked me, gave me compliments, and said he had a great time. We kept talking after that.

But then, kind of out of nowhere, he said something like:

“Our date came to around ₹2500. If you’re okay with splitting, it would be ₹1250 each. Would that work for you?”
