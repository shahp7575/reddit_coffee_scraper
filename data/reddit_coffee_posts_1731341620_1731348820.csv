Anyway the question really is: I chose the T90's to get a fast drop when I was brewing the switch Hoffman style  full-immersion recipe, so a non-clog fast drop filter was it and the Abaca's are annoying to get locally, but maybe I should slow it down again?

1goyomf,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1goyomf/arrested_for_cleaning/,Arrested for cleaning,"More horror tales from my nursing career. I don’t wish to be completely negative about being a nurse as many of my patient interactions were very positive and the best part of any shift was when I had the time for direct patient care. I hold many memories of genuinely lovely patients who were very grateful for the care they received. This point being the reason that I wished I had stayed as an auxiliary nurse and never went through university to earn a degree. One night shift, in an attempt to stay awake I headed off to clean out the medication trolley as it was always a mess do as part of my duties was to clean and restock the medication trolley, clean and check the resuscitation trolley was well stocked and all items in date and wiped over to keep it clean. So, this one night I said about restocking the medicine trolley cleaning the sticky bottles and checking the stock was all in date. All fine was cleaned and empty boxes thrown away, etc. at the time we were not allowed to have any food or fluids out on the ward, these had to be made and remain in the kitchen on the ward and it was the normal practice to go into the kitchen take a glug of coffee and get on with whatever job was required next. I went home the next morning as normal however this one day I was a walk from my sleep at 12 midday by two policeman on my doorstep. It was explained that I was to accompany the policeman to the police station and all would be explained there. When I arrived at the police station, I was DNS swapped my fingerprints taken and I was locked in a cell, I had no clue what an earth was happening as nothing was explained to me. An hour or so later I was escorted into interview room where there was a pharmacist and somebody from HR at the police station who wanted to question me about events from the following nightshift I gave them a quick rundown of my duties to the best of my knowledge bearing in mind I had had three hours sleep. HR focused on the cleaning of the trolley I was asked questions along the line of is it normal to clean and restock the medication trolley at three in the morning to which I replied that at 3 o’clock in the morning any job would be taken up to prevent the extreme tirednessof working a nightshift. The on-call solicitor asked if there was any stock missing from the trolley to which the pharmacist replied we don’t know it was at this point. The on-call solicitor advised me that with no actual theft taken place and that all items were actually accounted for. It was then explained that my pupils appeared to be a dilated. I explained that I was working in reduced lighting which the normal physiological reaction to being in dim light is for the pupils to dilate to allow more light in, just as in bright light pupils reducing size as there is adequate light. So to cut a long story short the whole trip to the police station was a complete waste of police time and due to the fact that there was no medication missing the whole situation was deemed unnecessary and I was expected to return for a nightshift that same night. Of course I did not return on that night as I was a little bit upset and angry at being falsely accused. Never once was an apology offered as higher management made the excuse that any allegations required investigation. This is one of the main reasons why I am no longer a nurse. And I definitely never cleaned that trolley again. I am sorry about the typos in this as I have dictated this experience, but I am happy to clear up any questions you have",1,1731348331.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1goyn2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1goyn2f/eye_in_the_sky/,Eye In The Sky,"There was a day when the launch of a satellite was news that excited the whole of Humanity. When even the concept of a satellite was so strange and alien as to be almost unimaginable. 

Time, and technology progressed, and the impossible became familiar. Satellites became something launched with abandon, so routine that their launches via rocket were no longer news. Ironically, as their importance to everyday life grew, they were thought of less and less.

Then came the Contact War, and the Second Hekatian War, and suddenly what occupied Earth’s orbit was no longer a secondary concern. Though the cadence of launches swelled far past any civilian’s ability to keep up, they at least understood what was going up. For the first time in history, Humanity was facing an orbital war, and it had to keep up.

Communications satellites, reconnaissance satellites, navigational satellites. Combat satellites, with lasers or missiles, nuclear or conventional. All were vital to the wars that Humanity fought in defence of it’s liberty, and it’s survival.

Ever since then, Humanity has never dared to take the satellite for granted again. Every new world they place themselves upon is blanketed by satellites, constantly maintained, upgraded, replaced. They would be joined by their lower flying cousins in the pseudo-satellites, high-flying drones or airships that perform many similar roles while inside the comforting blanket of the atmosphere.

But no one would be more keenly aware of the importance of the satellite than the United Nations’ military forces. They felt the standard galactic procedure, of having each warship carry a small complement of satellites into operations, while certainly effective was not sufficient.

And so, when the skies around a hostile world fill with weapons and warships, without fail, one of those vessels will be the *Argus* class Expeditionary Launch Platform.

The *Argus* class is built for one task, and one task alone: to saturate the orbit of a contested world with enough satellites to cover every possible need in every possible place. This is a Herculean task, and yet the Argus accomplishes it when no other ship can, drowning out the smaller satellite stocks of troopships and carriers.

The *Argus* is an ugly model of ship, a long bulky tube whose front is peppered with railgun muzzles. This is because of the class’ unique approach to satellite insertion: firing them into the desired orbit with a precisely calibrated railgun, minimising the amount of fuel that is required by the satellite. The *Argus*, therefore, despite being completely incapable of any combat actions beyond *limited* self defence, is constructed effectively as a series of gun barrels and giant magazines, each filled with a different kind of satellite to use as it’s ammunition.

At work, an *Argus* indeed resembles a machine gun, railguns spitting forth sabot-jacketed satellite after satellite in a steady stream. Spies witnessing an early training exercise with the class were convinced it was designed for orbital bombardment, and this myth persists to this day in certain segments of the population.

Of course, the *Argus* is not a vessel of peace. It is a warship of the United Nations Stellar Navy, even if it does not kill directly. It’s combat satellites are designed to assist in the task of locking down a planet’s orbit, by intercepting enemy craft attempting to break the blockade, or missiles being used against friendly forces. Reconnaissance satellites directly feed high quality live data to guide orbital fire support, develop the latest weather models to aid artillery rounds, help commanders position their forces for maximum effect. Navigational and communication satellites help keep soldiers from getting lost, but also ensure a missile hits exactly where it needs to. Electronic warfare satellites are often critical during contested planetary landings, and are vital for limiting enemy coordination. Even repair satellites exist to sustain these other vital jobs, or assist the warships of the Stellar Navy. When all is said and done, an *Argus* is one of the most *lethal* ships in an invasion based purely on the difference it’s cargo can make.

An *Argus* does not have to be a tool of war, however. Their most common usage is laying down the first orbital networks around a freshly surveyed world, their microsats serving Sirius Initiative researchers or the newest inhabitants. In the event of large scale disasters, an *Argus* is usually one of the response teams. A mobile antenna kit is just as likely to be dropped in an aid package as food or medicine, and no less vital.

It’s satellites are not permanent fixtures in the skies, as their limited fuel tends to leave them with relatively short lifespans. In combat situations, they are also highly attrited by enemy forces. But this does not trouble the *Argus* class. They derive their name from the Argus Panoptes, a mythological giant with a hundred eyes. And as far as the crew of each *Argus* is concerned, they have a hundred more to spare.

This was just a quick one based on a concept I had while writing something else. Not too much else to it, I just figure that the idea of a dedicated satellite deployer as part of a invasion fleet is a good idea.

Things were absolutely dream like (of course, its the honeymoon phase) for 6 months. As of around June or July, apparently a new girl who we will call Melissa. For context, me and my boyfriend work together. Sam has always been close with a girl we will call Bertha. Sam is very close with bertha & Bertha has acted as mentor/work wife. I was super nice to & supported their work relationship cause Bertha is not my boyfriend’s type, is married with multiple kids. 

My boyfriend had to train Melissa & they worked closely together. I heard nothing of this girl (is it weird to expect your partner to tell you these things?) until his friend/now boss made a joke to me that he was flirting with a girl. I joked and said “Flirting with you or the other gay man in the office?”. I felt secure. 

Fast forward and apparently Bertha was prying, Sam complained about my drinking habits and probably other things (Sam doesn’t drink). I am very open with communication and am more than happy to make necessary changes for the health of this relationship. Bertha pulled Sam into the conference room to say that they should date Melissa. 

Sam told me about these interactions after the fact & we all sat down for a dinner to resolve. It was absolutely ridiculous. I gave Big Bertha the opportunity to fess up & have a conversation about her nudging & even apologized that I called her a bitch to Sam who told Big Bertha I said that. 

Now I set FIRM boundaries to Sam telling him not to talk to Bertha about me, to leave me the eff out of it because I don’t need work gossip and cattiness. I told Sam I have no interest in being friendly with Bertha after this because of MULTIPLE red flags she had given prior.

I live with Sam, things settled, I trust him but now I’m starting to rethink that decision. I texted Bertha & said “Idk what Sam has been saying, no matter how flat you make a pancake there is two sides (he’s omitted information of conversations in the past) but I don’t have any interest in being friends. We work together and that’s it”. She sent him a screenshot, told him to delete it, and he did. He asked me about it saying I don’t trust him. Well yeah, Sam didn’t tell me about this new girl until I found out from a co worker, didn’t tell me the full story about Bertha until I had to pry & found out Sam was talking about grievances to her instead of me. 

We had a happy hour at work last week. Sam works on a entirely different team now & has no reason to talk to either Bertha or Melissa (Bertha is Melissa’s boss! haha) I walked outside & saw him sitting between Big Bertha & Melissa laughing. I stayed silent, shaking. Get in the car to drive home, I’m silent & trying to process what I just saw (blatant disregard for me) & he gets angry that I’m upset & asked only if it was about him talking to Bertha. Bertha had Cory unknowingly sit in Melissa’s chair & made it to where Melissa could corner him. 

Today I walked in our room & his phone fell & he fumbled about. Mfer even stirred his coffee all nervous as hell. Looking ass. I don’t know how much more sketchiness & red flags I can ignore here.

*The woman lay on a hospital bed that was too large for her room, groaning and shifting in pain as her final moments approached. She glared desperately at the young man emptying her bedpan. Her grip was strong, and he nearly dropped it.*

*The young man turned away, trying to hide his smirk and eye roll.* 

 

\+++

 

Stark white, fringed with lace, and roughly the size of his head. Granny panties for a woman who had never been a granny. How had these panties gotten into the box reserved for photo albums, doilies, and Precious Moments figurines?

""They should have been in the laundry bag with..."" Brett thought aloud, ""...the blue dress.""

Had there been a hole in the bag, or had he been careless? Or was it another similar-looking pair? He shrugged. It was too late to worry about it now. Great Aunt Jill was freshly buried under six feet of fresh dirt in Silent Memorial Cemetery.

Barely suppressing a mean-spirited chuckle, he tossed them into the kitchen trash as he went out onto the porch to grab a breath of fresh air.

*No, he thought, Not THE porch. MY porch. I earned it.*

And the old hag hadn't just left him the house; he'd gotten every penny of her money, which was a lot. Great Aunt Jill had been

rich, not super rich, but rich enough to never need anything- rich enough to have family members coming to her with their hands out morning, noon, and night. However, since she was stingy, Great Aunt Jill stayed rich and got richer.

*""...Nude under my clothes.""* Brett took in the crisp fall air; that was just one of the many stupid and neurotic statements he'd heard from the woman over the last eight years. There was a big box out at the curb; it was brimming with her paintings and statuettes depicting the suffering of Christ. He thought of how they depicted Jesus in his oversized loincloth. Was it any wonder the woman thought that visible panty lines were a sign of virtue and modesty?

After a few more minutes, he headed inside; there was a lot more to pack up if he was going to transform what had once been his prison into a bachelor pad. He thought to himself that his life shouldn't have been this way, that at twenty-four, he should have been on his own and living a life of acceptable debauchery. All the people he had gone to high school with were out in the world; even if they were losers that were never going to leave town at least they were starting their lives.

*And why?* Brett thought. *Because their parents had given them breathing space to make mistakes and be kids. But not me. Oh no, all I got was Great Aunt Jill.*

He had been just sixteen years old when his parents gave up on him. Yes, he had gotten into trouble, but it was the standard teenager stuff- shoplifting, school fights, and marijuana possession. Unfortunately, it had been just enough shoplifting, school fights, and marijuana possession to leave him at serious risk of going to juvenile detention. Good luck and good lawyers had helped Brett avoid that fate, but when it had all blown over, his parents told him he would be sent to live in the bucolic wasteland of Elmira, NY. It was there, they were sure, that Great Aunt Jill would 'straighten him out.'

In retrospect, he wished he had taken his chances in juvie.

Brett remembered his parents dropping him off here to leave him in the care of a relative he had previously only seen at holidays and funerals. A relative he only remembered because of her bell- like shape and dry kisses. As soon as Brett finished waving goodbye to Mom and Dad, his new guardian laid down the house rules - no loud radios, no TV except for educational and religious programming, and no video games. It was lights out at 10 PM. There was no lock on the bathroom door, so if he dared to pleasure himself in a righteous household, she would catch him, and he would find himself doing Hail Marys while kneeling on pencils.

That was when Brett made the mistake of asking her what a Hail Mary was.

A dozen Hail Marys later, she took him to his new room up in the attic. It was just a bed, a lamp, and a chest of drawers. The wind whispered through the cracks in the windowsill, making him shiver as he imagined the cold drafts that would come with it.

It took Brett a little while longer to clear out her wardrobe. For a woman who had only seemed to wear six to seven outfits her whole life, Great Aunt Jill sure had a lot of clothes stuffed into bureaus, dressers, and closets. Once that was done, he started to break down the hospital bed she had used for the last few months of her life. He pushed the bed out onto the front porch; the Hospice service had promised to pick it up by sundown. That done, all Brett had left was clearing out the junk drawers. He tossed anything that might remind him of her.

He found a black and white photograph in the far drawer of the kitchen counter; it was mixed in amongst the pens, pencils, rubber bands, and broken rosaries. It was of his Great Uncle John, who died just a few years after his marriage to Great Aunt Jill. Everyone said it was a tragic boating accident, but sometimes Brett had to wonder if her nagging and lunacy had driven the man to suicide. Brett swept all of it into the trash.

By nightfall, he was surveying an empty house. On Monday, he would visit the lawyer regarding the disbursement of the

inheritance. Then he could put anything he wanted in the place- a giant television, a pool table, a fantastic sound system, anything at all. Brett decided to celebrate with a sandwich and one of the beers he had cooling in the fridge. It was probably the only beer that had ever rested in that refrigerator.

He made himself a sandwich to go along with it and ate blissfully, thinking that, at long last, the future was his.

 

\+++

 

From the ages of sixteen to twenty-four, Brett had learned a great many things beyond the basic necessities of survival, like keeping the house neat, his manners perfect, and how to sneak down into the basement laundry room at one AM so he could masturbate. Brett also learned that his parents weren't coming back for him and that he'd been written off.

*No, not written off... sold off.* Brett thought.

He was sure that was why his parents had stranded him in Elmira, trying to win Great Aunt Jill's heart and a place in her will by giving her the one thing she never had.

A son of her own to care for, dote on, and emasculate.

It didn't matter how many times he begged to come home. It didn't matter that at every family gathering, he felt himself drifting further and further from the emotional orbit of his parents and siblings until they started to treat him with the same kind of cool affection they'd reserve for a third cousin.

He treasured the memory of his relatives at the reading of the will, their hopeful faces turning to shock when they realized they were getting the financial equivalent of a Walmart gift card.

Four months later, those same relatives were coming to see Brett, not that often, but often enough. They came with their hands out, and he slapped them away.

Not even when his parents came to him with a business plan for a cheese shop or when his uncle needed money to keep his house. Not even when his sister begged him to help her afford to care for her severely disabled child,

That was another thing he'd learned from her, *""Never a borrower or a lender be.""*

There was a knock at the door. Brett paused to look at himself in the full-length mirror of his bedroom: dark sweater, skinny jeans, and a killer goatee. He was ready. Brett answered the door and found Melanie waiting for him. She was an assistant librarian at the college, which sounded dull, but he didn't care if she gelded horses for a living. What mattered was that she was sexy, easy to talk to, and she'd swiped in the right direction on the hookup app he'd been scrolling through non-stop for the past month.

Brett led her to the dining room; a spaghetti dinner was simmering on the stove. Since Great Aunt Jill had expected him to prepare dinner regularly, he'd had to quickly learn how to cook, and she was not one to give a culinary lesson more than once. He'd always resented being her personal chef, but now, basking in the compliments from Melanie, he was almost grateful.

There was wine; there was small talk, and there was a moment when she wiped a bit of tomato sauce from his chin with her fingers and then licked them clean. And with that small talk, his planned desert of homemade tiramisu went by the wayside. They kissed and wasted no time finding their way to Brett's bedroom. They kicked off their shoes and panted nonsense words to each other. Brett was so aroused he felt dizzy. It was finally going to happen. He was finally going to become a man. He was finally going to put into practice all the things he'd dreamed about for over twelve years.

Brett slowly peeled away Melanie's clothes, savoring every moment. Her blouse and bra fell to the floor as he nuzzled her neck and explored her smooth skin. Their bodies pressed together, the heat between them growing stronger by the second. Melanie removed his sweater and cooed at his freshly shaved

chest. Then her hands moved down, unbuckling his belt. She began to stroke him, and he felt his knees quiver.

Eagerly, he reached down and undid the zipper of Melanie's skirt. By the time he had it off her, she had begun to talk dirty. Really dirty. Her skirt pooled at her feet, revealing the stark white lace- trimmed panties she wore.

Brett felt his entire body go cold. He looked back up the length of her, hoping it was a trick of the light or one too many glasses of wine, but no. They were there, the waste band riding high up near her navel and the leg holes riding low. They might as well have been a pair of bleached bicycle shorts. He got them off her as fast as he could and threw them across the room.

But it was too late. The damage was done. Brett's arousal had quite literally dwindled away to nothing, and despite Melanie's considerable skills, there was no going back. She made excuses and quickly got dressed; she didn't stay to talk and give him time to recover. Soon enough, Brett was all alone, despising himself and gorging on tiramisu.

Melanie never talked to him again, and it almost seemed like she'd put the word out. The app went silent. There were no pings of interest or responses to his direct messages. It was the end of his online journey, so Brett tried his luck with the bar scene, but he spent more time eating poorly made chicken wings and sipping watery drinks than he did making conversation. He worked hard to keep himself from glaring at the happy couples around him or the smooth talkers making the rounds.

He tried college bars; he tried sports bars and pubs. He even tried a gay bar, but that was by accident. Finally, he found his way to a dive called the Bunkhouse. It was tucked away on a side street, the building's neon sign hung crookedly, and its paint was

peeling. The pool tables were poorly maintained, and every employee from the bartenders to the house band was sullen and disinterested; it was there he got his second chance; her name was Olive, and she was middle-aged with a leathery tan and a tiger-striped skirt. She had frizzy hair and crooked teeth, but when he bought her a drink, she bluntly asked him if he wanted to get his dick wet.

He was too desperate to turn down the offer. Olive brought him to her car and ushered him into the back seat. She didn't care that they were right there on the street. She was rough when she pulled down his pants. He told her he didn't have a condom; she told him she'd had a hysterectomy. Then she stopped talking for a while and went to work. She was even rougher with her mouth, but it was enough. Brett wanted to complete this rite of passage. He wanted to graduate from being a boy to being a man. After a few minutes, Olive shifted around, accidentally elbowing him in the gut as she maneuvered her knees to either side of his head. Her nylons rasped against his ears. She told him that it was time to return the favor. Brett reached up, caressing her backside. He thought to himself that maybe this wasn't so bad after all.

A car drove past, headlights briefly illuminating the backseat to reveal her white, oversized panties. Instantly, Brett began to hyperventilate and thrash about. Olive took this as encouragement and began to grind harder against him, which only made him thrash harder, which only made her grind harder. This continued seemingly forever, only ending when Brett fainted.

One hour later, he was driving home, the stink of Olive's perfume on his clothes a constant reminder he had woken up to find an EMT kneeling over him, a crowd of onlookers surrounding him, and his pants around his ankles. Apparently, Olive had shoved him out of her car and fled the scene.

*What the Hell is happening to me?* He wondered. *What more could possibly go wrong?*

Despite owning a perfectly good washing machine and dryer, Brett had begun taking his clothes to the Pristine Fold and Dry laundromat every week. Not because he didn't have time but because he was trying to get to know the assistant manager better. Her name was Emily, and over the last few weeks, he'd managed to learn about her pet bird, her useless college degree, and her passion for painting.

Every week, he learned something new. And today, he'd learned Emily was a lesbian.

With a disappointed and angry grumble, he carried his two bags of freshly washed clothes inside the house. It had been four weeks since the disaster with Olive. During that time, Brett had attempted to make connections naturally by striking up conversations with women he encountered at work, the coffee shop, or Walmart. Unfortunately, most of them brushed him off, but there were a few instances where he managed to go on first dates. However, those never led to second dates. Brett tore open the plastic bags and started sorting through his clothing.

He remembered the heated conversation with the last girl that had turned him down. He'd demanded to know where he went wrong, and she responded with a hint of pity, saying that he was a perfectly nice guy but was trying too hard.

That turn of phrase only frustrated him further. *Trying too hard?*

He only had what he had in this world because he had tried hard, tried hard to get a good education, tried hard to excel at work, and, of course, tried hard to keep Great Aunt Jill out of a nursing home where her estate would have been nickel and dimed away to nothing. He deserved that honors diploma; he deserved his promotion to manager in less than a year; he deserved Great Aunt Jill's fortune.

Didn't it stand to reason that he deserved some wild nights in the

sack? Hadn't he earned it?

*She probably isn't really a lesbian.* Brett thought to himself as he crammed the neatly folded shirts into the upper drawers of his bureau.

*I bet she was just trying to scare me off.* Brett tossed his socks into the drawer opposite and closed it again with a slam.

*She's probably laughing about me to all her friends.* He should have hung his pants up, but instead, he just threw them over a chair.

That’s the last time I ever take my clothes there. he vowed as he turned his attention to his underwear. He'd read numerous men's magazines on the subject of what women liked more, boxers or briefs. He'd gone with boxers in varying styles of plaid and stripes.

That was why one pale garment stood out from the rest. A pair of large, white panties. Brett reeled, stumbling backward until he struck the bureau, knocking the katana he had displayed there to the floor.

It was a coincidence. It had to be; nothing else made sense, but it took Brett a long time before he could approach the undergarment. But when he could, he tore it to pieces with his bare hands.

 

\+++ 

 

There was a strip club almost an hour from Elmira called the Blue Bayou. Whispers and rumors circulated about rampant prostitution among the performers, and that was enough to make Brett think it might be worth the drive. It had been more than a year since Great Aunt Jill's death, and the pangs of loneliness and frustration were driving him to the brink.

*And what's wrong with paying to get some?* He told himself as he turned off the interstate and found his way to the bad section of Binghamton. Plenty of guys at work like to say that all men pay for it one way or another- single guys with dinner and drinks, husbands with jewelry and appliances.

What was wrong with getting some action with a little bit of cold, hard cash? Wasn’t that just cutting out the middleman?

As Brett's car neared the Blue Bayou, he conjured up images of what its interior might look like. He had never been to a gentlemen's club before, but from what he had seen in movies and TV shows, he pictured a dimly lit room filled with plush leather chairs and red velvet curtains. The air would be thick with the scent of perfume and whiskey, and rock music blaring over the sound system would play in the background.

He could see himself sitting at the bar, sipping on a whiskey while watching beautiful women dance on stage. He imagined their bodies glistening under the stage lights as they moved seductively to the music. He saw himself casually flashing some bills, catching a dancer's eye at the bar; she was a sultry brunette with deep brown eyes and a tiny dress. He would buy her a drink, and she would casually tell him all the things he could experience in a private room.

And oh yes. He would experience it all, and then when he was finished, he would have a drink and then repeat the process. He would do it again and again until he ran out of cash or stamina. Brett was so lost in this fantasy that he didn't realize there was a police raid going on until he had pulled into the parking lot.

Flashing blue and red lights dazzled him. By the time he recovered his wits and tried to leave, there was already a uniformed police officer blocking the path of his car. The officer was tall and imposing, and despite it being almost eleven o'clock at night, he was wearing sunglasses. The officer rapped on the driver's side window with a meaty fist. Brett rolled down his window. The officer didn't ask for a license and registration - he

demanded it.

The license was in his wallet, and the registration was in his glove compartment, but the glove compartment was brimming with fast food detritus and CDs. Brett pawed through them, tossing Night Ranger and Limp Bizkit's greatest hits onto the seat beside him. Then he grabbed hold of something soft to the touch.

And shapeless.

And stark white.

And trimmed with lace.

And roughly the size of his head. Brett screamed.

A month later, Brett was jittery and teary-eyed. Whenever he went in his house, whatever he did, he found them. Searching for a bottle opener, Brett discovered one tucked away in the junk drawer. Investigating the clogged vacuum cleaner, he found one entangled in the drive belt. When he sat down to breakfast, a pair tumbled out of his box of cereal. Brett decided it must be all in his mind, so he made an appointment to visit a psychiatrist, only to flee the waiting room when a pair of panties, along with some subscription cards, fell out of the magazine he was flipping through.

Those damned panties hounded him at every turn.

*No.* He thought, *It's her. She's haunting me.* 

And Brett knew why. 

*""Don't let them leave me nude under my clothes...”* 

By now, the only women he saw were the ones on his computer.

Brett would stay up late at night, navigating from one website to the next until he found some explicit content that could temporarily distract him from his troubles. With just a VPN and solid antivirus protection, he could escape into his wildest fantasies: an endless supply of women in different apparel and settings

The final straw came after he finished satisfying himself with a video of a particularly nimble young woman. Overwhelmed with his normal surge of self-disgust, he scrambled to find something to clean himself up with, but the object his hand landed on wasn’t his box of tissues.

It was stark white, fringed with lace, and roughly the size of his head.

Brett went mad. He smashed his computer, ripped the television off its wall mounting, and threw it out the front window. Brett broke chairs and flipped tables. He pulled curtains from their fixtures and sent bookshelves toppling. Finally, he punched a hole in the wall.

And dozens of pairs of panties came spilling out. And everything went black.

Hours later, he found himself sobbing in the corner of the basement.

*So. she wants her damn granny panties, does she?*

He would see to it she got them. Brett had everything he needed in the basement: a flashlight, a collapsible camping shovel, kerosene, and a crowbar. He packed everything but the kerosene into a duffel bag. The kerosene was for the couch and coffee table.

His car peeled out of his driveway with a loud screech. The last thing he saw of Great Aunt Jill's house was the first thick plumes of smoke rising from the broken windows.

It was a dark and stormy night, which made breaking into the cemetery easy. He carefully parked his car out of sight and hoisted his equipment over the fence's low spot before awkwardly scrambling up after it, grunting with effort as he struggled to find footing on the slick surface. The smell of damp earth filled his nostrils as he made his way through the rows of headstones, his heart beating faster with every step.

At around one AM, Brett discovered the tombstone shared by Great Aunt Jill and Great Uncle John. His heart raced, cold rain drenched him to the skin. He felt exhausted, alone, and cursed, but the storm had at least softened the ground for digging.

However, unearthing the grave proved to be a lengthy, backbreaking process. Each time Brett thought he was making progress, one side of the grave would collapse, forcing him to start again. Brett remained determined. He had come too far to turn back now.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the end of the shovel hit something hard. Moments later, the coffin was uncovered. Brett took a moment to catch his breath. Would it be enough to leave the forgotten undergarments here and fill in the grave again? Would that break the curse?

How far would he have to take this? Would he have to actually put them on her?

The thought made Brett shudder with revulsion, but there was no turning back now. Brett grabbed the crowbar and, working with a low growl, exerted all his remaining strength until he felt the wood start to give way with a loud cracking sound. The stench was worse than he could ever imagine, both rancid and sweet; bile filled his mouth, and his eyes watered.

Great Aunt Jill's one-year-old corpse looked far older. Her bloated body was covered in rotting skin, and her once elegant funeral dress had been stained with sporadic patches. The features of her face were twisted into a grimace.

*I have to do this.* Brett thought, *I have to do this.*  
He reached down with trembling hands and pulled up the hem of

her skirt. Then he dug his hand into his jacket pocket.

The panties weren't there.

He tried the other pocket. Still nothing.

""No."" Brett said as he checked each pocket a second and third time, ""Oh no no no no.”

They were gone.

*Where did they go?*

Clawing his way out of the grave, Brett looked around frantically for that damned scrap of cloth. He tried to remember when he last had them, but his thoughts were hazy and jumbled.

Were they back at the car? Or perhaps amidst the burning remains of the house?

Brett retraced his steps through the rain-soaked cemetery. The storm intensified, lightning illuminating the gravestones. He stumbled through the muddy terrain, sopping and desperate.

Then Brett realized, and he started tearing at himself, the crack of thunder swallowing his choking cries.

*The lead caretaker walked through Silent Memorial Cemetery in the hazy dawn light. It was a quiet job he had taken on after selling his groundskeeping business years ago. He enjoyed being in nature with only birds and rabbits as his companions. Passing rows of headstones, old and new, he felt a sense of peace.*

*Then he saw something that sent him running back to the office;*

*he dialed 911 and started babbling the minute the operator answered. ""I need the police down at Silent Memorial. Someone dug up one of the graves, and there's this young man lying dead just a few feet away. .. Yes, he's dead. I know a dead man when I see one!

We are in our mid twenties, he does commercial real estate and I do digital marketing. We are wondering what neighborhoods we should be looking for apartments. We enjoy nightlife but also would love to have restaurants and coffee shops in a walkable distance. We also have a dog so any neighborhood near park space for her to get exercise would be great.

*The young man turned away, trying to hide his smirk and eye roll.* 

 

\+++

 

Stark white, fringed with lace, and roughly the size of his head. Granny panties for a woman who had never been a granny. How had these panties gotten into the box reserved for photo albums, doilies, and Precious Moments figurines?

""They should have been in the laundry bag with..."" Brett thought aloud, ""...the blue dress.""

Had there been a hole in the bag, or had he been careless? Or was it another similar-looking pair? He shrugged. It was too late to worry about it now. Great Aunt Jill was freshly buried under six feet of fresh dirt in Silent Memorial Cemetery.

Barely suppressing a mean-spirited chuckle, he tossed them into the kitchen trash as he went out onto the porch to grab a breath of fresh air.

*No, he thought, Not THE porch. MY porch. I earned it.*

And the old hag hadn't just left him the house; he'd gotten every penny of her money, which was a lot. Great Aunt Jill had been

rich, not super rich, but rich enough to never need anything- rich enough to have family members coming to her with their hands out morning, noon, and night. However, since she was stingy, Great Aunt Jill stayed rich and got richer.

*""...Nude under my clothes.""* Brett took in the crisp fall air; that was just one of the many stupid and neurotic statements he'd heard from the woman over the last eight years. There was a big box out at the curb; it was brimming with her paintings and statuettes depicting the suffering of Christ. He thought of how they depicted Jesus in his oversized loincloth. Was it any wonder the woman thought that visible panty lines were a sign of virtue and modesty?

After a few more minutes, he headed inside; there was a lot more to pack up if he was going to transform what had once been his prison into a bachelor pad. He thought to himself that his life shouldn't have been this way, that at twenty-four, he should have been on his own and living a life of acceptable debauchery. All the people he had gone to high school with were out in the world; even if they were losers that were never going to leave town at least they were starting their lives.

*And why?* Brett thought. *Because their parents had given them breathing space to make mistakes and be kids. But not me. Oh no, all I got was Great Aunt Jill.*

He had been just sixteen years old when his parents gave up on him. Yes, he had gotten into trouble, but it was the standard teenager stuff- shoplifting, school fights, and marijuana possession. Unfortunately, it had been just enough shoplifting, school fights, and marijuana possession to leave him at serious risk of going to juvenile detention. Good luck and good lawyers had helped Brett avoid that fate, but when it had all blown over, his parents told him he would be sent to live in the bucolic wasteland of Elmira, NY. It was there, they were sure, that Great Aunt Jill would 'straighten him out.'

In retrospect, he wished he had taken his chances in juvie.

Brett remembered his parents dropping him off here to leave him in the care of a relative he had previously only seen at holidays and funerals. A relative he only remembered because of her bell- like shape and dry kisses. As soon as Brett finished waving goodbye to Mom and Dad, his new guardian laid down the house rules - no loud radios, no TV except for educational and religious programming, and no video games. It was lights out at 10 PM. There was no lock on the bathroom door, so if he dared to pleasure himself in a righteous household, she would catch him, and he would find himself doing Hail Marys while kneeling on pencils.

That was when Brett made the mistake of asking her what a Hail Mary was.

A dozen Hail Marys later, she took him to his new room up in the attic. It was just a bed, a lamp, and a chest of drawers. The wind whispered through the cracks in the windowsill, making him shiver as he imagined the cold drafts that would come with it.

It took Brett a little while longer to clear out her wardrobe. For a woman who had only seemed to wear six to seven outfits her whole life, Great Aunt Jill sure had a lot of clothes stuffed into bureaus, dressers, and closets. Once that was done, he started to break down the hospital bed she had used for the last few months of her life. He pushed the bed out onto the front porch; the Hospice service had promised to pick it up by sundown. That done, all Brett had left was clearing out the junk drawers. He tossed anything that might remind him of her.

He found a black and white photograph in the far drawer of the kitchen counter; it was mixed in amongst the pens, pencils, rubber bands, and broken rosaries. It was of his Great Uncle John, who died just a few years after his marriage to Great Aunt Jill. Everyone said it was a tragic boating accident, but sometimes Brett had to wonder if her nagging and lunacy had driven the man to suicide. Brett swept all of it into the trash.

By nightfall, he was surveying an empty house. On Monday, he would visit the lawyer regarding the disbursement of the

inheritance. Then he could put anything he wanted in the place- a giant television, a pool table, a fantastic sound system, anything at all. Brett decided to celebrate with a sandwich and one of the beers he had cooling in the fridge. It was probably the only beer that had ever rested in that refrigerator.

He made himself a sandwich to go along with it and ate blissfully, thinking that, at long last, the future was his.

From the ages of sixteen to twenty-four, Brett had learned a great many things beyond the basic necessities of survival, like keeping the house neat, his manners perfect, and how to sneak down into the basement laundry room at one AM so he could masturbate. Brett also learned that his parents weren't coming back for him and that he'd been written off.

*No, not written off... sold off.* Brett thought.

He was sure that was why his parents had stranded him in Elmira, trying to win Great Aunt Jill's heart and a place in her will by giving her the one thing she never had.

A son of her own to care for, dote on, and emasculate.

It didn't matter how many times he begged to come home. It didn't matter that at every family gathering, he felt himself drifting further and further from the emotional orbit of his parents and siblings until they started to treat him with the same kind of cool affection they'd reserve for a third cousin.

He treasured the memory of his relatives at the reading of the will, their hopeful faces turning to shock when they realized they were getting the financial equivalent of a Walmart gift card.

Four months later, those same relatives were coming to see Brett, not that often, but often enough. They came with their hands out, and he slapped them away.

Not even when his parents came to him with a business plan for a cheese shop or when his uncle needed money to keep his house. Not even when his sister begged him to help her afford to care for her severely disabled child,

That was another thing he'd learned from her, *""Never a borrower or a lender be.""*

There was a knock at the door. Brett paused to look at himself in the full-length mirror of his bedroom: dark sweater, skinny jeans, and a killer goatee. He was ready. Brett answered the door and found Melanie waiting for him. She was an assistant librarian at the college, which sounded dull, but he didn't care if she gelded horses for a living. What mattered was that she was sexy, easy to talk to, and she'd swiped in the right direction on the hookup app he'd been scrolling through non-stop for the past month.

Brett led her to the dining room; a spaghetti dinner was simmering on the stove. Since Great Aunt Jill had expected him to prepare dinner regularly, he'd had to quickly learn how to cook, and she was not one to give a culinary lesson more than once. He'd always resented being her personal chef, but now, basking in the compliments from Melanie, he was almost grateful.

There was wine; there was small talk, and there was a moment when she wiped a bit of tomato sauce from his chin with her fingers and then licked them clean. And with that small talk, his planned desert of homemade tiramisu went by the wayside. They kissed and wasted no time finding their way to Brett's bedroom. They kicked off their shoes and panted nonsense words to each other. Brett was so aroused he felt dizzy. It was finally going to happen. He was finally going to become a man. He was finally going to put into practice all the things he'd dreamed about for over twelve years.

Brett slowly peeled away Melanie's clothes, savoring every moment. Her blouse and bra fell to the floor as he nuzzled her neck and explored her smooth skin. Their bodies pressed together, the heat between them growing stronger by the second. Melanie removed his sweater and cooed at his freshly shaved

chest. Then her hands moved down, unbuckling his belt. She began to stroke him, and he felt his knees quiver.

Eagerly, he reached down and undid the zipper of Melanie's skirt. By the time he had it off her, she had begun to talk dirty. Really dirty. Her skirt pooled at her feet, revealing the stark white lace- trimmed panties she wore.

Brett felt his entire body go cold. He looked back up the length of her, hoping it was a trick of the light or one too many glasses of wine, but no. They were there, the waste band riding high up near her navel and the leg holes riding low. They might as well have been a pair of bleached bicycle shorts. He got them off her as fast as he could and threw them across the room.

But it was too late. The damage was done. Brett's arousal had quite literally dwindled away to nothing, and despite Melanie's considerable skills, there was no going back. She made excuses and quickly got dressed; she didn't stay to talk and give him time to recover. Soon enough, Brett was all alone, despising himself and gorging on tiramisu.

Melanie never talked to him again, and it almost seemed like she'd put the word out. The app went silent. There were no pings of interest or responses to his direct messages. It was the end of his online journey, so Brett tried his luck with the bar scene, but he spent more time eating poorly made chicken wings and sipping watery drinks than he did making conversation. He worked hard to keep himself from glaring at the happy couples around him or the smooth talkers making the rounds.

He tried college bars; he tried sports bars and pubs. He even tried a gay bar, but that was by accident. Finally, he found his way to a dive called the Bunkhouse. It was tucked away on a side street, the building's neon sign hung crookedly, and its paint was

peeling. The pool tables were poorly maintained, and every employee from the bartenders to the house band was sullen and disinterested; it was there he got his second chance; her name was Olive, and she was middle-aged with a leathery tan and a tiger-striped skirt. She had frizzy hair and crooked teeth, but when he bought her a drink, she bluntly asked him if he wanted to get his dick wet.

He was too desperate to turn down the offer. Olive brought him to her car and ushered him into the back seat. She didn't care that they were right there on the street. She was rough when she pulled down his pants. He told her he didn't have a condom; she told him she'd had a hysterectomy. Then she stopped talking for a while and went to work. She was even rougher with her mouth, but it was enough. Brett wanted to complete this rite of passage. He wanted to graduate from being a boy to being a man. After a few minutes, Olive shifted around, accidentally elbowing him in the gut as she maneuvered her knees to either side of his head. Her nylons rasped against his ears.

He imagined their bodies glistening under the stage lights as they moved seductively to the music. He saw himself casually flashing some bills, catching a dancer's eye at the bar; she was a sultry brunette with deep brown eyes and a tiny dress. He would buy her a drink, and she would casually tell him all the things he could experience in a private room.

And oh yes. He would experience it all, and then when he was finished, he would have a drink and then repeat the process. He would do it again and again until he ran out of cash or stamina. Brett was so lost in this fantasy that he didn't realize there was a police raid going on until he had pulled into the parking lot.

Flashing blue and red lights dazzled him. By the time he recovered his wits and tried to leave, there was already a uniformed police officer blocking the path of his car. The officer was tall and imposing, and despite it being almost eleven o'clock at night, he was wearing sunglasses. The officer rapped on the driver's side window with a meaty fist. Brett rolled down his window. The officer didn't ask for a license and registration - he

demanded it.

The license was in his wallet, and the registration was in his glove compartment, but the glove compartment was brimming with fast food detritus and CDs. Brett pawed through them, tossing Night Ranger and Limp Bizkit's greatest hits onto the seat beside him. Then he grabbed hold of something soft to the touch.

And shapeless.

And stark white.

And trimmed with lace.

And roughly the size of his head. Brett screamed.

A month later, Brett was jittery and teary-eyed. Whenever he went in his house, whatever he did, he found them. Searching for a bottle opener, Brett discovered one tucked away in the junk drawer. Investigating the clogged vacuum cleaner, he found one entangled in the drive belt. When he sat down to breakfast, a pair tumbled out of his box of cereal. Brett decided it must be all in his mind, so he made an appointment to visit a psychiatrist, only to flee the waiting room when a pair of panties, along with some subscription cards, fell out of the magazine he was flipping through.

Those damned panties hounded him at every turn.

*No.* He thought, *It's her. She's haunting me.* 

And Brett knew why. 

*""Don't let them leave me nude under my clothes...”* 

By now, the only women he saw were the ones on his computer.

Brett would stay up late at night, navigating from one website to the next until he found some explicit content that could temporarily distract him from his troubles. With just a VPN and solid antivirus protection, he could escape into his wildest fantasies: an endless supply of women in different apparel and settings

The final straw came after he finished satisfying himself with a video of a particularly nimble young woman. Overwhelmed with his normal surge of self-disgust, he scrambled to find something to clean himself up with, but the object his hand landed on wasn’t his box of tissues.

It was stark white, fringed with lace, and roughly the size of his head.

Brett went mad. He smashed his computer, ripped the television off its wall mounting, and threw it out the front window. Brett broke chairs and flipped tables. He pulled curtains from their fixtures and sent bookshelves toppling. Finally, he punched a hole in the wall.

And dozens of pairs of panties came spilling out. And everything went black.

Hours later, he found himself sobbing in the corner of the basement.

*So. she wants her damn granny panties, does she?*

He would see to it she got them. Brett had everything he needed in the basement: a flashlight, a collapsible camping shovel, kerosene, and a crowbar. He packed everything but the kerosene into a duffel bag. The kerosene was for the couch and coffee table.

His car peeled out of his driveway with a loud screech. The last thing he saw of Great Aunt Jill's house was the first thick plumes of smoke rising from the broken windows.

It was a dark and stormy night, which made breaking into the cemetery easy. He carefully parked his car out of sight and hoisted his equipment over the fence's low spot before awkwardly scrambling up after it, grunting with effort as he struggled to find footing on the slick surface. The smell of damp earth filled his nostrils as he made his way through the rows of headstones, his heart beating faster with every step.

At around one AM, Brett discovered the tombstone shared by Great Aunt Jill and Great Uncle John. His heart raced, cold rain drenched him to the skin. He felt exhausted, alone, and cursed, but the storm had at least softened the ground for digging.

However, unearthing the grave proved to be a lengthy, backbreaking process. Each time Brett thought he was making progress, one side of the grave would collapse, forcing him to start again. Brett remained determined. He had come too far to turn back now.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the end of the shovel hit something hard. Moments later, the coffin was uncovered. Brett took a moment to catch his breath. Would it be enough to leave the forgotten undergarments here and fill in the grave again? Would that break the curse?

How far would he have to take this? Would he have to actually put them on her?

The thought made Brett shudder with revulsion, but there was no turning back now. Brett grabbed the crowbar and, working with a low growl, exerted all his remaining strength until he felt the wood start to give way with a loud cracking sound. The stench was worse than he could ever imagine, both rancid and sweet; bile filled his mouth, and his eyes watered.

Great Aunt Jill's one-year-old corpse looked far older. Her bloated body was covered in rotting skin, and her once elegant funeral dress had been stained with sporadic patches. The features of her face were twisted into a grimace.

*I have to do this.* Brett thought, *I have to do this.*  
He reached down with trembling hands and pulled up the hem of

her skirt. Then he dug his hand into his jacket pocket.

The panties weren't there.

He tried the other pocket. Still nothing.

""No."" Brett said as he checked each pocket a second and third time, ""Oh no no no no.”

They were gone.

*Where did they go?*

Clawing his way out of the grave, Brett looked around frantically for that damned scrap of cloth. He tried to remember when he last had them, but his thoughts were hazy and jumbled.

Were they back at the car? Or perhaps amidst the burning remains of the house?

Brett retraced his steps through the rain-soaked cemetery. The storm intensified, lightning illuminating the gravestones. He stumbled through the muddy terrain, sopping and desperate.

Then Brett realized, and he started tearing at himself, the crack of thunder swallowing his choking cries.

\+++

 

Stark white, fringed with lace, and roughly the size of his head. Granny panties for a woman who had never been a granny. How had these panties gotten into the box reserved for photo albums, doilies, and Precious Moments figurines?

""They should have been in the laundry bag with..."" Brett thought aloud, ""...the blue dress.""

Had there been a hole in the bag, or had he been careless? Or was it another similar-looking pair? He shrugged. It was too late to worry about it now. Great Aunt Jill was freshly buried under six feet of fresh dirt in Silent Memorial Cemetery.

Barely suppressing a mean-spirited chuckle, he tossed them into the kitchen trash as he went out onto the porch to grab a breath of fresh air.

*No, he thought, Not THE porch. MY porch. I earned it.*

And the old hag hadn't just left him the house; he'd gotten every penny of her money, which was a lot. Great Aunt Jill had been

rich, not super rich, but rich enough to never need anything- rich enough to have family members coming to her with their hands out morning, noon, and night. However, since she was stingy, Great Aunt Jill stayed rich and got richer.

*""...Nude under my clothes.""* Brett took in the crisp fall air; that was just one of the many stupid and neurotic statements he'd heard from the woman over the last eight years. There was a big box out at the curb; it was brimming with her paintings and statuettes depicting the suffering of Christ. He thought of how they depicted Jesus in his oversized loincloth. Was it any wonder the woman thought that visible panty lines were a sign of virtue and modesty?

After a few more minutes, he headed inside; there was a lot more to pack up if he was going to transform what had once been his prison into a bachelor pad. He thought to himself that his life shouldn't have been this way, that at twenty-four, he should have been on his own and living a life of acceptable debauchery. All the people he had gone to high school with were out in the world; even if they were losers that were never going to leave town at least they were starting their lives.

*And why?* Brett thought. *Because their parents had given them breathing space to make mistakes and be kids. But not me. Oh no, all I got was Great Aunt Jill.*

He had been just sixteen years old when his parents gave up on him. Yes, he had gotten into trouble, but it was the standard teenager stuff- shoplifting, school fights, and marijuana possession. Unfortunately, it had been just enough shoplifting, school fights, and marijuana possession to leave him at serious risk of going to juvenile detention. Good luck and good lawyers had helped Brett avoid that fate, but when it had all blown over, his parents told him he would be sent to live in the bucolic wasteland of Elmira, NY. It was there, they were sure, that Great Aunt Jill would 'straighten him out.'

In retrospect, he wished he had taken his chances in juvie.

Brett remembered his parents dropping him off here to leave him in the care of a relative he had previously only seen at holidays and funerals. A relative he only remembered because of her bell- like shape and dry kisses. As soon as Brett finished waving goodbye to Mom and Dad, his new guardian laid down the house rules - no loud radios, no TV except for educational and religious programming, and no video games. It was lights out at 10 PM. There was no lock on the bathroom door, so if he dared to pleasure himself in a righteous household, she would catch him, and he would find himself doing Hail Marys while kneeling on pencils.

That was when Brett made the mistake of asking her what a Hail Mary was.

A dozen Hail Marys later, she took him to his new room up in the attic. It was just a bed, a lamp, and a chest of drawers. The wind whispered through the cracks in the windowsill, making him shiver as he imagined the cold drafts that would come with it.

It took Brett a little while longer to clear out her wardrobe. For a woman who had only seemed to wear six to seven outfits her whole life, Great Aunt Jill sure had a lot of clothes stuffed into bureaus, dressers, and closets. Once that was done, he started to break down the hospital bed she had used for the last few months of her life. He pushed the bed out onto the front porch; the Hospice service had promised to pick it up by sundown. That done, all Brett had left was clearing out the junk drawers. He tossed anything that might remind him of her.

He found a black and white photograph in the far drawer of the kitchen counter; it was mixed in amongst the pens, pencils, rubber bands, and broken rosaries. It was of his Great Uncle John, who died just a few years after his marriage to Great Aunt Jill. Everyone said it was a tragic boating accident, but sometimes Brett had to wonder if her nagging and lunacy had driven the man to suicide. Brett swept all of it into the trash.

By nightfall, he was surveying an empty house. On Monday, he would visit the lawyer regarding the disbursement of the

inheritance. Then he could put anything he wanted in the place- a giant television, a pool table, a fantastic sound system, anything at all. Brett decided to celebrate with a sandwich and one of the beers he had cooling in the fridge. It was probably the only beer that had ever rested in that refrigerator.

He made himself a sandwich to go along with it and ate blissfully, thinking that, at long last, the future was his.

 

\+++

 

From the ages of sixteen to twenty-four, Brett had learned a great many things beyond the basic necessities of survival, like keeping the house neat, his manners perfect, and how to sneak down into the basement laundry room at one AM so he could masturbate. Brett also learned that his parents weren't coming back for him and that he'd been written off.

*No, not written off... sold off.* Brett thought.

He was sure that was why his parents had stranded him in Elmira, trying to win Great Aunt Jill's heart and a place in her will by giving her the one thing she never had.

A son of her own to care for, dote on, and emasculate.

It didn't matter how many times he begged to come home. It didn't matter that at every family gathering, he felt himself drifting further and further from the emotional orbit of his parents and siblings until they started to treat him with the same kind of cool affection they'd reserve for a third cousin.

He treasured the memory of his relatives at the reading of the will, their hopeful faces turning to shock when they realized they were getting the financial equivalent of a Walmart gift card.

Four months later, those same relatives were coming to see Brett, not that often, but often enough. They came with their hands out, and he slapped them away.

Not even when his parents came to him with a business plan for a cheese shop or when his uncle needed money to keep his house. Not even when his sister begged him to help her afford to care for her severely disabled child,

That was another thing he'd learned from her, *""Never a borrower or a lender be.""*

There was a knock at the door. Brett paused to look at himself in the full-length mirror of his bedroom: dark sweater, skinny jeans, and a killer goatee. He was ready. Brett answered the door and found Melanie waiting for him. She was an assistant librarian at the college, which sounded dull, but he didn't care if she gelded horses for a living. What mattered was that she was sexy, easy to talk to, and she'd swiped in the right direction on the hookup app he'd been scrolling through non-stop for the past month.

Brett led her to the dining room; a spaghetti dinner was simmering on the stove. Since Great Aunt Jill had expected him to prepare dinner regularly, he'd had to quickly learn how to cook, and she was not one to give a culinary lesson more than once. He'd always resented being her personal chef, but now, basking in the compliments from Melanie, he was almost grateful.

There was wine; there was small talk, and there was a moment when she wiped a bit of tomato sauce from his chin with her fingers and then licked them clean. And with that small talk, his planned desert of homemade tiramisu went by the wayside. They kissed and wasted no time finding their way to Brett's bedroom. They kicked off their shoes and panted nonsense words to each other. Brett was so aroused he felt dizzy. It was finally going to happen. He was finally going to become a man. He was finally going to put into practice all the things he'd dreamed about for over twelve years.

Brett slowly peeled away Melanie's clothes, savoring every moment. Her blouse and bra fell to the floor as he nuzzled her neck and explored her smooth skin. Their bodies pressed together, the heat between them growing stronger by the second. Melanie removed his sweater and cooed at his freshly shaved

chest. Then her hands moved down, unbuckling his belt. She began to stroke him, and he felt his knees quiver.

Eagerly, he reached down and undid the zipper of Melanie's skirt. By the time he had it off her, she had begun to talk dirty. Really dirty. Her skirt pooled at her feet, revealing the stark white lace- trimmed panties she wore.

Brett felt his entire body go cold. He looked back up the length of her, hoping it was a trick of the light or one too many glasses of wine, but no. They were there, the waste band riding high up near her navel and the leg holes riding low. They might as well have been a pair of bleached bicycle shorts. He got them off her as fast as he could and threw them across the room.

But it was too late. The damage was done. Brett's arousal had quite literally dwindled away to nothing, and despite Melanie's considerable skills, there was no going back. She made excuses and quickly got dressed; she didn't stay to talk and give him time to recover. Soon enough, Brett was all alone, despising himself and gorging on tiramisu.

 

\+++

 

Melanie never talked to him again, and it almost seemed like she'd put the word out. The app went silent. There were no pings of interest or responses to his direct messages. It was the end of his online journey, so Brett tried his luck with the bar scene, but he spent more time eating poorly made chicken wings and sipping watery drinks than he did making conversation. He worked hard to keep himself from glaring at the happy couples around him or the smooth talkers making the rounds.

He tried college bars; he tried sports bars and pubs. He even tried a gay bar, but that was by accident. Finally, he found his way to a dive called the Bunkhouse. It was tucked away on a side street, the building's neon sign hung crookedly, and its paint was

peeling. The pool tables were poorly maintained, and every employee from the bartenders to the house band was sullen and disinterested; it was there he got his second chance; her name was Olive, and she was middle-aged with a leathery tan and a tiger-striped skirt. She had frizzy hair and crooked teeth, but when he bought her a drink, she bluntly asked him if he wanted to get his dick wet.

He was too desperate to turn down the offer. Olive brought him to her car and ushered him into the back seat. She didn't care that they were right there on the street. She was rough when she pulled down his pants. He told her he didn't have a condom; she told him she'd had a hysterectomy. Then she stopped talking for a while and went to work. She was even rougher with her mouth, but it was enough. Brett wanted to complete this rite of passage. He wanted to graduate from being a boy to being a man. After a few minutes, Olive shifted around, accidentally elbowing him in the gut as she maneuvered her knees to either side of his head. Her nylons rasped against his ears. She told him that it was time to return the favor. Brett reached up, caressing her backside. He thought to himself that maybe this wasn't so bad after all.

A car drove past, headlights briefly illuminating the backseat to reveal her white, oversized panties. Instantly, Brett began to hyperventilate and thrash about. Olive took this as encouragement and began to grind harder against him, which only made him thrash harder, which only made her grind harder. This continued seemingly forever, only ending when Brett fainted.

One hour later, he was driving home, the stink of Olive's perfume on his clothes a constant reminder he had woken up to find an EMT kneeling over him, a crowd of onlookers surrounding him, and his pants around his ankles. Apparently, Olive had shoved him out of her car and fled the scene.

*What the Hell is happening to me?* He wondered. *What more could possibly go wrong?*

 

\+++ 

 

Despite owning a perfectly good washing machine and dryer, Brett had begun taking his clothes to the Pristine Fold and Dry laundromat every week. Not because he didn't have time but because he was trying to get to know the assistant manager better. Her name was Emily, and over the last few weeks, he'd managed to learn about her pet bird, her useless college degree, and her passion for painting.

Every week, he learned something new. And today, he'd learned Emily was a lesbian.

With a disappointed and angry grumble, he carried his two bags of freshly washed clothes inside the house. It had been four weeks since the disaster with Olive. During that time, Brett had attempted to make connections naturally by striking up conversations with women he encountered at work, the coffee shop, or Walmart. Unfortunately, most of them brushed him off, but there were a few instances where he managed to go on first dates. However, those never led to second dates. Brett tore open the plastic bags and started sorting through his clothing.

He remembered the heated conversation with the last girl that had turned him down. He'd demanded to know where he went wrong, and she responded with a hint of pity, saying that he was a perfectly nice guy but was trying too hard.

That turn of phrase only frustrated him further. *Trying too hard?*

He only had what he had in this world because he had tried hard, tried hard to get a good education, tried hard to excel at work, and, of course, tried hard to keep Great Aunt Jill out of a nursing home where her estate would have been nickel and dimed away to nothing. He deserved that honors diploma; he deserved his promotion to manager in less than a year; he deserved Great Aunt Jill's fortune.

Didn't it stand to reason that he deserved some wild nights in the

sack? Hadn't he earned it?

*She probably isn't really a lesbian.* Brett thought to himself as he crammed the neatly folded shirts into the upper drawers of his bureau.

*I bet she was just trying to scare me off.* Brett tossed his socks into the drawer opposite and closed it again with a slam.

*She's probably laughing about me to all her friends.* He should have hung his pants up, but instead, he just threw them over a chair.

That’s the last time I ever take my clothes there. he vowed as he turned his attention to his underwear. He'd read numerous men's magazines on the subject of what women liked more, boxers or briefs. He'd gone with boxers in varying styles of plaid and stripes.

That was why one pale garment stood out from the rest. A pair of large, white panties. Brett reeled, stumbling backward until he struck the bureau, knocking the katana he had displayed there to the floor.

It was a coincidence. It had to be; nothing else made sense, but it took Brett a long time before he could approach the undergarment. But when he could, he tore it to pieces with his bare hands.

 

\+++ 

 

There was a strip club almost an hour from Elmira called the Blue Bayou. Whispers and rumors circulated about rampant prostitution among the performers, and that was enough to make Brett think it might be worth the drive. It had been more than a year since Great Aunt Jill's death, and the pangs of loneliness and frustration were driving him to the brink.

*And what's wrong with paying to get some?* He told himself as he turned off the interstate and found his way to the bad section of Binghamton. Plenty of guys at work like to say that all men pay for it one way or another- single guys with dinner and drinks, husbands with jewelry and appliances.

What was wrong with getting some action with a little bit of cold, hard cash? Wasn’t that just cutting out the middleman?

As Brett's car neared the Blue Bayou, he conjured up images of what its interior might look like. He had never been to a gentlemen's club before, but from what he had seen in movies and TV shows, he pictured a dimly lit room filled with plush leather chairs and red velvet curtains. The air would be thick with the scent of perfume and whiskey, and rock music blaring over the sound system would play in the background.

He could see himself sitting at the bar, sipping on a whiskey while watching beautiful women dance on stage. He imagined their bodies glistening under the stage lights as they moved seductively to the music. He saw himself casually flashing some bills, catching a dancer's eye at the bar; she was a sultry brunette with deep brown eyes and a tiny dress. He would buy her a drink, and she would casually tell him all the things he could experience in a private room.

And oh yes. He would experience it all, and then when he was finished, he would have a drink and then repeat the process. He would do it again and again until he ran out of cash or stamina. Brett was so lost in this fantasy that he didn't realize there was a police raid going on until he had pulled into the parking lot.

Flashing blue and red lights dazzled him. By the time he recovered his wits and tried to leave, there was already a uniformed police officer blocking the path of his car. The officer was tall and imposing, and despite it being almost eleven o'clock at night, he was wearing sunglasses. The officer rapped on the driver's side window with a meaty fist. Brett rolled down his window. The officer didn't ask for a license and registration - he

demanded it.

The license was in his wallet, and the registration was in his glove compartment, but the glove compartment was brimming with fast food detritus and CDs. Brett pawed through them, tossing Night Ranger and Limp Bizkit's greatest hits onto the seat beside him. Then he grabbed hold of something soft to the touch.

*""Please..."" she had said, her voice shrill yet weak, ""Please be sure they bury me in my blue church dress... and my own clean underwear. Sometimes they forget the underwear. Don't let them leave me nude under my clothes. Please.""*

*The young man turned away, trying to hide his smirk and eye roll.*

Stark white, fringed with lace, and roughly the size of his head. Granny panties for a woman who had never been a granny. How had these panties gotten into the box reserved for photo albums, doilies, and Precious Moments figurines?

""They should have been in the laundry bag with..."" Brett thought aloud, ""...the blue dress.""

Had there been a hole in the bag, or had he been careless? Or was it another similar-looking pair? He shrugged. It was too late to worry about it now. Great Aunt Jill was freshly buried under six feet of fresh dirt in Silent Memorial Cemetery.

Barely suppressing a mean-spirited chuckle, he tossed them into the kitchen trash as he went out onto the porch to grab a breath of fresh air.

*No, he thought, Not THE porch. MY porch. I earned it.*

And the old hag hadn't just left him the house; he'd gotten every penny of her money, which was a lot. Great Aunt Jill had been

rich, not super rich, but rich enough to never need anything- rich enough to have family members coming to her with their hands out morning, noon, and night. However, since she was stingy, Great Aunt Jill stayed rich and got richer.

*""...Nude under my clothes.""* Brett took in the crisp fall air; that was just one of the many stupid and neurotic statements he'd heard from the woman over the last eight years. There was a big box out at the curb; it was brimming with her paintings and statuettes depicting the suffering of Christ. He thought of how they depicted Jesus in his oversized loincloth. Was it any wonder the woman thought that visible panty lines were a sign of virtue and modesty?

After a few more minutes, he headed inside; there was a lot more to pack up if he was going to transform what had once been his prison into a bachelor pad. He thought to himself that his life shouldn't have been this way, that at twenty-four, he should have been on his own and living a life of acceptable debauchery. All the people he had gone to high school with were out in the world; even if they were losers that were never going to leave town at least they were starting their lives.

*And why?* Brett thought. *Because their parents had given them breathing space to make mistakes and be kids. But not me. Oh no, all I got was Great Aunt Jill.*

He had been just sixteen years old when his parents gave up on him. Yes, he had gotten into trouble, but it was the standard teenager stuff- shoplifting, school fights, and marijuana possession. Unfortunately, it had been just enough shoplifting, school fights, and marijuana possession to leave him at serious risk of going to juvenile detention. Good luck and good lawyers had helped Brett avoid that fate, but when it had all blown over, his parents told him he would be sent to live in the bucolic wasteland of Elmira, NY. It was there, they were sure, that Great Aunt Jill would 'straighten him out.'

In retrospect, he wished he had taken his chances in juvie.

Brett remembered his parents dropping him off here to leave him in the care of a relative he had previously only seen at holidays and funerals. A relative he only remembered because of her bell- like shape and dry kisses. As soon as Brett finished waving goodbye to Mom and Dad, his new guardian laid down the house rules - no loud radios, no TV except for educational and religious programming, and no video games. It was lights out at 10 PM. There was no lock on the bathroom door, so if he dared to pleasure himself in a righteous household, she would catch him, and he would find himself doing Hail Marys while kneeling on pencils.

That was when Brett made the mistake of asking her what a Hail Mary was.

A dozen Hail Marys later, she took him to his new room up in the attic. It was just a bed, a lamp, and a chest of drawers. The wind whispered through the cracks in the windowsill, making him shiver as he imagined the cold drafts that would come with it.

It took Brett a little while longer to clear out her wardrobe. For a woman who had only seemed to wear six to seven outfits her whole life, Great Aunt Jill sure had a lot of clothes stuffed into bureaus, dressers, and closets. Once that was done, he started to break down the hospital bed she had used for the last few months of her life. He pushed the bed out onto the front porch; the Hospice service had promised to pick it up by sundown. That done, all Brett had left was clearing out the junk drawers. He tossed anything that might remind him of her.

He found a black and white photograph in the far drawer of the kitchen counter; it was mixed in amongst the pens, pencils, rubber bands, and broken rosaries. It was of his Great Uncle John, who died just a few years after his marriage to Great Aunt Jill. Everyone said it was a tragic boating accident, but sometimes Brett had to wonder if her nagging and lunacy had driven the man to suicide. Brett swept all of it into the trash.

By nightfall, he was surveying an empty house. On Monday, he would visit the lawyer regarding the disbursement of the

inheritance. Then he could put anything he wanted in the place- a giant television, a pool table, a fantastic sound system, anything at all. Brett decided to celebrate with a sandwich and one of the beers he had cooling in the fridge. It was probably the only beer that had ever rested in that refrigerator.

He made himself a sandwich to go along with it and ate blissfully, thinking that, at long last, the future was his.

From the ages of sixteen to twenty-four, Brett had learned a great many things beyond the basic necessities of survival, like keeping the house neat, his manners perfect, and how to sneak down into the basement laundry room at one AM so he could masturbate. Brett also learned that his parents weren't coming back for him and that he'd been written off.

*No, not written off... sold off.* Brett thought.

He was sure that was why his parents had stranded him in Elmira, trying to win Great Aunt Jill's heart and a place in her will by giving her the one thing she never had.

A son of her own to care for, dote on, and emasculate.

It didn't matter how many times he begged to come home. It didn't matter that at every family gathering, he felt himself drifting further and further from the emotional orbit of his parents and siblings until they started to treat him with the same kind of cool affection they'd reserve for a third cousin.

He treasured the memory of his relatives at the reading of the will, their hopeful faces turning to shock when they realized they were getting the financial equivalent of a Walmart gift card.

Four months later, those same relatives were coming to see Brett, not that often, but often enough. They came with their hands out, and he slapped them away.

Not even when his parents came to him with a business plan for a cheese shop or when his uncle needed money to keep his house. Not even when his sister begged him to help her afford to care for her severely disabled child,

That was another thing he'd learned from her, *""Never a borrower or a lender be.""*

There was a knock at the door. Brett paused to look at himself in the full-length mirror of his bedroom: dark sweater, skinny jeans, and a killer goatee. He was ready. Brett answered the door and found Melanie waiting for him. She was an assistant librarian at the college, which sounded dull, but he didn't care if she gelded horses for a living. What mattered was that she was sexy, easy to talk to, and she'd swiped in the right direction on the hookup app he'd been scrolling through non-stop for the past month.

Brett led her to the dining room; a spaghetti dinner was simmering on the stove. Since Great Aunt Jill had expected him to prepare dinner regularly, he'd had to quickly learn how to cook, and she was not one to give a culinary lesson more than once. He'd always resented being her personal chef, but now, basking in the compliments from Melanie, he was almost grateful.

There was wine; there was small talk, and there was a moment when she wiped a bit of tomato sauce from his chin with her fingers and then licked them clean. And with that small talk, his planned desert of homemade tiramisu went by the wayside. They kissed and wasted no time finding their way to Brett's bedroom. They kicked off their shoes and panted nonsense words to each other. Brett was so aroused he felt dizzy. It was finally going to happen. He was finally going to become a man. He was finally going to put into practice all the things he'd dreamed about for over twelve years.

Brett slowly peeled away Melanie's clothes, savoring every moment. Her blouse and bra fell to the floor as he nuzzled her neck and explored her smooth skin. Their bodies pressed together, the heat between them growing stronger by the second. Melanie removed his sweater and cooed at his freshly shaved

chest. Then her hands moved down, unbuckling his belt. She began to stroke him, and he felt his knees quiver.

Eagerly, he reached down and undid the zipper of Melanie's skirt. By the time he had it off her, she had begun to talk dirty. Really dirty. Her skirt pooled at her feet, revealing the stark white lace- trimmed panties she wore.

Brett felt his entire body go cold. He looked back up the length of her, hoping it was a trick of the light or one too many glasses of wine, but no. They were there, the waste band riding high up near her navel and the leg holes riding low. They might as well have been a pair of bleached bicycle shorts. He got them off her as fast as he could and threw them across the room.

But it was too late. The damage was done. Brett's arousal had quite literally dwindled away to nothing, and despite Melanie's considerable skills, there was no going back. She made excuses and quickly got dressed; she didn't stay to talk and give him time to recover. Soon enough, Brett was all alone, despising himself and gorging on tiramisu.

 

\+++

 

Melanie never talked to him again, and it almost seemed like she'd put the word out. The app went silent. There were no pings of interest or responses to his direct messages. It was the end of his online journey, so Brett tried his luck with the bar scene, but he spent more time eating poorly made chicken wings and sipping watery drinks than he did making conversation. He worked hard to keep himself from glaring at the happy couples around him or the smooth talkers making the rounds.

He tried college bars; he tried sports bars and pubs. He even tried a gay bar, but that was by accident. Finally, he found his way to a dive called the Bunkhouse. It was tucked away on a side street, the building's neon sign hung crookedly, and its paint was

peeling. The pool tables were poorly maintained, and every employee from the bartenders to the house band was sullen and disinterested; it was there he got his second chance; her name was Olive, and she was middle-aged with a leathery tan and a tiger-striped skirt. She had frizzy hair and crooked teeth, but when he bought her a drink, she bluntly asked him if he wanted to get his dick wet.

He was too desperate to turn down the offer. Olive brought him to her car and ushered him into the back seat. She didn't care that they were right there on the street. She was rough when she pulled down his pants. He told her he didn't have a condom; she told him she'd had a hysterectomy. Then she stopped talking for a while and went to work. She was even rougher with her mouth, but it was enough. Brett wanted to complete this rite of passage. He wanted to graduate from being a boy to being a man. After a few minutes, Olive shifted around, accidentally elbowing him in the gut as she maneuvered her knees to either side of his head. Her nylons rasped against his ears. She told him that it was time to return the favor. Brett reached up, caressing her backside. He thought to himself that maybe this wasn't so bad after all.

A car drove past, headlights briefly illuminating the backseat to reveal her white, oversized panties. Instantly, Brett began to hyperventilate and thrash about. Olive took this as encouragement and began to grind harder against him, which only made him thrash harder, which only made her grind harder. This continued seemingly forever, only ending when Brett fainted.

One hour later, he was driving home, the stink of Olive's perfume on his clothes a constant reminder he had woken up to find an EMT kneeling over him, a crowd of onlookers surrounding him, and his pants around his ankles. Apparently, Olive had shoved him out of her car and fled the scene.

*What the Hell is happening to me?* He wondered. *What more could possibly go wrong?*

 

\+++ 

 

Despite owning a perfectly good washing machine and dryer, Brett had begun taking his clothes to the Pristine Fold and Dry laundromat every week. Not because he didn't have time but because he was trying to get to know the assistant manager better. Her name was Emily, and over the last few weeks, he'd managed to learn about her pet bird, her useless college degree, and her passion for painting.

Every week, he learned something new. And today, he'd learned Emily was a lesbian.

With a disappointed and angry grumble, he carried his two bags of freshly washed clothes inside the house. It had been four weeks since the disaster with Olive. During that time, Brett had attempted to make connections naturally by striking up conversations with women he encountered at work, the coffee shop, or Walmart. Unfortunately, most of them brushed him off, but there were a few instances where he managed to go on first dates. However, those never led to second dates. Brett tore open the plastic bags and started sorting through his clothing.

He remembered the heated conversation with the last girl that had turned him down. He'd demanded to know where he went wrong, and she responded with a hint of pity, saying that he was a perfectly nice guy but was trying too hard.

That turn of phrase only frustrated him further. *Trying too hard?*

He only had what he had in this world because he had tried hard, tried hard to get a good education, tried hard to excel at work, and, of course, tried hard to keep Great Aunt Jill out of a nursing home where her estate would have been nickel and dimed away to nothing. He deserved that honors diploma; he deserved his promotion to manager in less than a year; he deserved Great Aunt Jill's fortune.

Didn't it stand to reason that he deserved some wild nights in the

sack? Hadn't he earned it?

*She probably isn't really a lesbian.* Brett thought to himself as he crammed the neatly folded shirts into the upper drawers of his bureau.

*I bet she was just trying to scare me off.* Brett tossed his socks into the drawer opposite and closed it again with a slam.

*She's probably laughing about me to all her friends.* He should have hung his pants up, but instead, he just threw them over a chair.

That’s the last time I ever take my clothes there. he vowed as he turned his attention to his underwear. He'd read numerous men's magazines on the subject of what women liked more, boxers or briefs. He'd gone with boxers in varying styles of plaid and stripes.

That was why one pale garment stood out from the rest. A pair of large, white panties. Brett reeled, stumbling backward until he struck the bureau, knocking the katana he had displayed there to the floor.

It was a coincidence. It had to be; nothing else made sense, but it took Brett a long time before he could approach the undergarment. But when he could, he tore it to pieces with his bare hands.

There was a strip club almost an hour from Elmira called the Blue Bayou. Whispers and rumors circulated about rampant prostitution among the performers, and that was enough to make Brett think it might be worth the drive. It had been more than a year since Great Aunt Jill's death, and the pangs of loneliness and frustration were driving him to the brink.

*And what's wrong with paying to get some?* He told himself as he turned off the interstate and found his way to the bad section of Binghamton. Plenty of guys at work like to say that all men pay for it one way or another- single guys with dinner and drinks, husbands with jewelry and appliances.

What was wrong with getting some action with a little bit of cold, hard cash? Wasn’t that just cutting out the middleman?

As Brett's car neared the Blue Bayou, he conjured up images of what its interior might look like. He had never been to a gentlemen's club before, but from what he had seen in movies and TV shows, he pictured a dimly lit room filled with plush leather chairs and red velvet curtains. The air would be thick with the scent of perfume and whiskey, and rock music blaring over the sound system would play in the background.

He could see himself sitting at the bar, sipping on a whiskey while watching beautiful women dance on stage. He imagined their bodies glistening under the stage lights as they moved seductively to the music. He saw himself casually flashing some bills, catching a dancer's eye at the bar; she was a sultry brunette with deep brown eyes and a tiny dress. He would buy her a drink, and she would casually tell him all the things he could experience in a private room.

And oh yes. He would experience it all, and then when he was finished, he would have a drink and then repeat the process. He would do it again and again until he ran out of cash or stamina. Brett was so lost in this fantasy that he didn't realize there was a police raid going on until he had pulled into the parking lot.

Flashing blue and red lights dazzled him. By the time he recovered his wits and tried to leave, there was already a uniformed police officer blocking the path of his car. The officer was tall and imposing, and despite it being almost eleven o'clock at night, he was wearing sunglasses. The officer rapped on the driver's side window with a meaty fist. Brett rolled down his window. The officer didn't ask for a license and registration - he

demanded it.

The license was in his wallet, and the registration was in his glove compartment, but the glove compartment was brimming with fast food detritus and CDs. Brett pawed through them, tossing Night Ranger and Limp Bizkit's greatest hits onto the seat beside him. Then he grabbed hold of something soft to the touch.

And shapeless.

  
And stark white.

  
And trimmed with lace.

  
And roughly the size of his head. Brett screamed.

 

\+++ 

 

A month later, Brett was jittery and teary-eyed. Whenever he went in his house, whatever he did, he found them. Searching for a bottle opener, Brett discovered one tucked away in the junk drawer. Investigating the clogged vacuum cleaner, he found one entangled in the drive belt. When he sat down to breakfast, a pair tumbled out of his box of cereal. Brett decided it must be all in his mind, so he made an appointment to visit a psychiatrist, only to flee the waiting room when a pair of panties, along with some subscription cards, fell out of the magazine he was flipping through.

Those damned panties hounded him at every turn.

*No.* He thought, *It's her. She's haunting me.* 

And Brett knew why. 

*""Don't let them leave me nude under my clothes...”* 

By now, the only women he saw were the ones on his computer.

Brett would stay up late at night, navigating from one website to the next until he found some explicit content that could temporarily distract him from his troubles. With just a VPN and solid antivirus protection, he could escape into his wildest fantasies: an endless supply of women in different apparel and settings

The final straw came after he finished satisfying himself with a video of a particularly nimble young woman. Overwhelmed with his normal surge of self-disgust, he scrambled to find something to clean himself up with, but the object his hand landed on wasn’t his box of tissues.

It was stark white, fringed with lace, and roughly the size of his head.

Brett went mad. He smashed his computer, ripped the television off its wall mounting, and threw it out the front window. Brett broke chairs and flipped tables. He pulled curtains from their fixtures and sent bookshelves toppling. Finally, he punched a hole in the wall.

And dozens of pairs of panties came spilling out. And everything went black.

Hours later, he found himself sobbing in the corner of the basement.

*So. she wants her damn granny panties, does she?*

He would see to it she got them. Brett had everything he needed in the basement: a flashlight, a collapsible camping shovel, kerosene, and a crowbar. He packed everything but the kerosene into a duffel bag. The kerosene was for the couch and coffee table.

His car peeled out of his driveway with a loud screech. The last thing he saw of Great Aunt Jill's house was the first thick plumes of smoke rising from the broken windows.

It was a dark and stormy night, which made breaking into the cemetery easy. He carefully parked his car out of sight and hoisted his equipment over the fence's low spot before awkwardly scrambling up after it, grunting with effort as he struggled to find footing on the slick surface. The smell of damp earth filled his nostrils as he made his way through the rows of headstones, his heart beating faster with every step.

At around one AM, Brett discovered the tombstone shared by Great Aunt Jill and Great Uncle John. His heart raced, cold rain drenched him to the skin. He felt exhausted, alone, and cursed, but the storm had at least softened the ground for digging.

However, unearthing the grave proved to be a lengthy, backbreaking process. Each time Brett thought he was making progress, one side of the grave would collapse, forcing him to start again. Brett remained determined. He had come too far to turn back now.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the end of the shovel hit something hard. Moments later, the coffin was uncovered. Brett took a moment to catch his breath. Would it be enough to leave the forgotten undergarments here and fill in the grave again? Would that break the curse?

How far would he have to take this? Would he have to actually put them on her?

The thought made Brett shudder with revulsion, but there was no turning back now. Brett grabbed the crowbar and, working with a low growl, exerted all his remaining strength until he felt the wood start to give way with a loud cracking sound. The stench was worse than he could ever imagine, both rancid and sweet; bile filled his mouth, and his eyes watered.

Great Aunt Jill's one-year-old corpse looked far older. Her bloated body was covered in rotting skin, and her once elegant funeral dress had been stained with sporadic patches. The features of her face were twisted into a grimace.

*I have to do this.* Brett thought, *I have to do this.*  
He reached down with trembling hands and pulled up the hem of

her skirt. Then he dug his hand into his jacket pocket.

The panties weren't there.

He tried the other pocket. Still nothing.

""No."" Brett said as he checked each pocket a second and third time, ""Oh no no no no.”

They were gone.

*Where did they go?*

Clawing his way out of the grave, Brett looked around frantically for that damned scrap of cloth. He tried to remember when he last had them, but his thoughts were hazy and jumbled.

Were they back at the car? Or perhaps amidst the burning remains of the house?

Brett retraced his steps through the rain-soaked cemetery. The storm intensified, lightning illuminating the gravestones. He stumbled through the muddy terrain, sopping and desperate.

Then Brett realized, and he started tearing at himself, the crack of thunder swallowing his choking cries.

*The lead caretaker walked through Silent Memorial Cemetery in the hazy dawn light. It was a quiet job he had taken on after selling his groundskeeping business years ago. He enjoyed being in nature with only birds and rabbits as his companions. Passing rows of headstones, old and new, he felt a sense of peace.*

*Then he saw something that sent him running back to the office;*

*he dialed 911 and started babbling the minute the operator answered. ""I need the police down at Silent Memorial. Someone dug up one of the graves, and there's this young man lying dead just a few feet away. .. Yes, he's dead. I know a dead man when I see one!

My symptoms go through the roof and I get really bad anxiety and agitation. Even if I drink a very small amount. I’ve been using organic cacao powder instead of coffee and it’s way better for me. The main chemical is theobromine instead of caffeine. Longer lasting than caffeine but less stimulation. I usually have 1-1.5tsp in hot water and milk with 1-1.5tsp of monk fruit. It could take some time to kick in unlike coffee which is fast acting. Give it 1.5-2 hours minimum to kick in. Also, please note that cocoa and cacao are different. Cacao is more pure. Go organic if you try it. Don’t ever go 1 tbsp (full dose) at first because it could be too much! 1 tsp is a good place to start. I like taking it on an empty stomach in the morning mixed with water and milk. Or later in the day after waiting a while after eating. Also, I’m not a doctor so don’t take this as medical advice.

Not gonna lie it freaked me out a little bit and I don’t know what to do about it. Over the past few years our cat has been proudly presenting us with waste like coffee filters , empty cigarette packs , empty bags that looked like they had food in them at one point and we’ve always been wondering where he got that stuff , he even brought us a croissant which still looked pretty fresh now I’m asking myself if there is someone living in there maybe . The only way to get onto the property is to walk over our property and jump over a small fence since the front door which is like an old barn door is locked . Should I call the police over it or maybe try and find out who’s the owner of the property? I was thinking to maybe nail the doors shut so our cat won’t get in there anymore but honestly I’m a bit scared to there again to be honest.

i’m crying in my car after doing terrible on a chemistry exam. i’m only in school because my mom told me i have to be. 

therapy and meds don’t work, ive been fucked up ever since i can remember because of early sexual experiences and abuse from my parents (separate instances). therapy and meds don’t change this sort of thing, my brain was like moldable clay back then but it has since been put in the kiln (i am 21 now). i struggle to make friends and find loved ones or community or anything. i contribute nothing to the world besides depressing rants and serving rich people coffee. i leech off mentally healthy people in a desperate attempt to learn their ways so i can better myself. until they start bleeding too, because i take too much, and then they flick me into the bushes.

i don’t want to die miserably like how i am right now, i want to win and be happy and make other people happy. but i don’t tend to make other people happy, not even my mom (i only text her when i need something). and i don’t tend to win. 

i have no children, no siblings, a best friend who does not think of me the same way, and few other friends or family. my boyfriend is in love with his ex and i have claimed to be okay with it because i want anything i can get at this point. we barely even see each other. i yearn for connection, but i hate most other people. my life would be forgotten entirely in 5 years. i don’t think i can make it out of this, so i want to die.

Turns out, pressing your ear against the wall while holding your breath isn't actually the most efficient way to monitor your sleeping baby. Who knew? So, it was time to get a decent baby monitor, and I decided to try out this option from HelloBaby.

Here's what happened next.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Update:

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

The 5-inch screen seemed massive compared to my phone – finally, a screen size that matches my anxiety level. Also, the camera unit looked like a friendly robot, which was reassuring because if something's going to watch my baby all night, it might as well be cute.

Setting it up was straightforward, especially for someone who once spent three hours trying to connect their smart toaster to WiFi. And speaking of WiFi – there isn't any! It's like stepping back into 2005, but in a good way. 

# My Favorite Features

**Pan-tilt-zoom capabilities.** I found myself using this feature more than I'd like to admit. Is that a sock or did my baby somehow acquire a hamster? Pan left. Is the shadow in the corner just the stuffed giraffe or has the Boogeyman finally gotten a part-time job? Tilt up.

**Night vision.** The infrared night vision is so clear, it's almost unsettling. Your baby will look like they're starring in their own black-and-white art film, which is pretty much what 3am feedings feel like anyway.

**Two-way audio.** The two-way audio is also crystal clear, perfect for soothing your baby or pranking your spouse. I've used it to remind my husband about dirty diapers he ""forgot"" to take out, and once to convince him the baby's stuffed animals were staging a revolt. The audio sensitivity is impressive too. You can hear everything from full-blown crying to those weird sleep grunts that make your baby sound like a tiny weightlifter.

**Battery life.** I've managed to get through multiple naps, a full night's sleep, and several episodes of binge-watching while scrolling parenting forums without needing a charge.

**Range.** The 1000ft range means you can finally pee in peace from any bathroom in your house. You could probably even check on your baby from your neighbor's house, though I don't recommend testing this unless you want to explain yourself to the police.

# Pros

* No WiFi means hackers can't turn your baby monitor into their personal reality show
* Battery life lasts a long time
* Picture quality is very clear 
* Temperature monitoring is a nice added bonus
* Simple enough setup that you can do it while sleep-deprived
* Wall mounting option for those who want to get fancy
* Multi-camera expandability for when you need to monitor your baby's entire kingdom
* The price won't require selling your firstborn (which would defeat the purpose anyway)

# Cons

* Makes it too easy to become obsessed with watching your sleeping baby
* You'll probably end up watching the monitor instead of actually sleeping when you should
* The lullaby selection will haunt your dreams
* No WiFi means no sharing live feeds with grandparents (though this could also be a pro)

# Final Thoughts

**Who Should Buy This:**

* Parents who value sleep enough to spend money on watching their baby sleep
* Tech-minimal families who don't want another WiFi-dependent device
* Anyone who's ever wanted to direct their own black-and-white baby documentary
* Parents who need proof their baby actually does sleep sometimes
* People who appreciate being able to set up a device without calling tech support

**Who Should Skip It:**

* Parents who need their baby monitor to also make coffee
* Social media influencers who want to livestream their baby's every move
* People who enjoy complicated setup processes and reading lengthy manuals

Every single shot is either too sour to drink or too acidic to even taste. I can't seem to replicate my good espressos, with little difference between double or single shot. My grind size is currently at 3.5 with a max temp, and this seems to work for single espressos, but never consistently. I've gone through two thirds a bag of beans just dialing the damn thing in.

This happened before we met, and spare tire and all, I love him. I’d like it if he lost weight and he’s declared he’s “watching what he eats” several times, but then he eats carbs and sweets and burgers and fries. If we are out he always wants to order food. I’m a good cook, and I have kids and my oldest is into baking. So we usually have cookies or something lying around. Ok, enough backstory.

Today, I know BF is working extra hours and is low on money and has to fly to another state to see his kids over Txgvg. We work in the same bldg so on my way to work when I did an Amazon ret at Whole Foods, I got us each two pastries, and I really tried to be aware of what I got. I got myself a croissant and donut, and I got my BF a croissant and a blueberry scone, a pear, and an iced coffee w no sugar. I figured if he’s here 8 am to 7 pm, that was better than chips or other junk. 

He came into my office and thanked me for the snacks and then very sternly said “No more sweets.” I was a little offended. Here I’m feeding him and my thinking is “just toss it if you don’t want to eat it.” I thought the fruit and coffee showed I’m cognizant that he may not want a pastry. 

I want to add that to complicate things, last night I said I was hungry and he suggested a burger place. He ordered a double burger, fries and a vanilla shake. After we got back home he ate a dessert my kid made (lemon tart with whipped cream) and then a flatbread, which he took from my fridge and baked. I was not hungry but he says I’m too thin so I ate some.

AITAH?

TLDR- Am I responsible for my BF’s weight and if I do get him a pastry to try to be thoughtful, is it ok for him to scold me?

I'm sure you guys get these questions all the time in this sub, but my situation is a little different. So some background here, around May I went to a fast food restaurant on a friday and left some sauce in my car (in the container in the bag) and left it in the car for a hot weekend because I forgot about it. I took it in on that following Monday and my car smelled SO BAD. Like, imagine the worst, most potent weed smell ever. Anyway, I just lived with it for a while because I figured it would go away. It didn't. Well, eventually it did in early August, after deodorant was sprayed in the air vents. However, by the time September rolled around, it started to smell like weed again. When it got a little colder, the smell kind of went away but started to just smell gross, like a way I couldn't describe. But it literally just comes back and smelling worse every time. I've tried everything I can. I've cleaned the entire car. I've cleaned the carpet, cleaned everything out of it, lifted the seats (it's an SUV with leather seats, so the smell couldn't penetrate the seats, right? I cleaned those too though), changed the cabin air filter (which was FILTHY btw) and deep cleaned the car as a whole. None of the sauce spilled into the car. The car doesn't have any food stains. There's no food left in my car and I can still smell the scent. And the worst part about it is that I've tried everything and no matter what I do is that it comes back. HOWEVER when I turn my air conditioner on, it takes like 30-40 seconds and it smells normal. I'm so exhausted. I don't know what to do anymore. Please let me know your car cleaning tips in the comments.  The only things I haven't tried are baking soda, coffee grounds, vinegar, and ozone stuff, just because I'm skeptical if they'd even work. I also saw in the rules that I'm supposed to include my car model, all I know is that it's a 2011 Limited Toyota 4-Runner.

I just recently purchased a 2025 ES 300h Ultra Luxury and wanted to share my initial impressions and thoughts on the \~400 miles I have driven it so far. The car I came from was a 2010 Toyota Yaris with \~230k miles on it, so this was a pretty huge upgrade.

I will break down my thoughts on various aspects of the car below.

# Pricing & Specs

* $52,275 USD pre-tax, title, registration
* All optional factory items included (i.e. triple-beam LEDs, Mark Levinson sound system, 18-in alloy wheels, etc.)
* Some extra dealer add-ons like door protection guards, rear bumper applique, all-weather floor liners. These didn't seem to affect the price much though luckily as I was still able to get the car for well under its MSRP (\~$57,000 USD).
* Palomino interior with walnut wood trim
* White (Eminent Pearl) exterior

# Comfort & QOL

The general build quality and comfort of the ES are the first, and probably most impressive, aspects of the car that anyone would notice when stepping into it for the first time. The seats are soft and supportive and the semi-aniline leather is incredibly smooth. Heated seats work well, but the real showstopper for me is how well the ventilated seats work; I'm someone that is almost always running too hot, so ventilated seats make long car rides so much more pleasant for me, especially if I'm getting in the car after sweating at the gym, coming back from a hike, etc. 

The only thing that irks me a little about the seats is that the 14 way customization makes it a little annoying to find the perfect seat settings to maximize comfort and minimize fatigue on long drives; I had to do quite a bit of experimenting with different seat configurations before I felt truly comfortable. I know that at this price point it's probably not realistic to have a ""smart"" seat adjusting option that automates some of the seat adjustment process to suit your body, but I would have been willing to pay extra for that as an add-on. 

Leg room is exceptional and I never feel like my legs are cramped as a 5'11"" man. I can definitely see that if you are over 6' though, the headroom might be a little lacking for you, as I don't have much space left above my head at 5'11"". This seems to be pretty common in most Lexus cars though. Definitely test-drive the ES first if you are taller as I could see this being a dealbreaker for you.

I have only had front passengers with me in the car so far so I can't comment on the rear seat comfort, but I have tested that I can sit comfortably behind my own seat settings in the rear. Front passengers have had nothing but positive things to say about the comfort of the car; dual zone climate control and seat heating/cooling controls seem to work just as well on the passenger side as the driver side. Passengers have also appreciated the large center console armrest and the fact that it opens 2 ways.

Another nitpick, but I am very much an enjoyer of large water bottles (I'm pretty much always carrying a 32oz+ water bottle) and I so wish that I could fit my Hydro Flask in the center cup holders up front or in the side compartments in the doors. I feel like large water bottles are increasingly popular these days so it would be a really nice quality of life feature for luxury manufacturers to start considering having at least one storage spot for large water bottles in the future. Not a huge issue, but I do have to resort unfortunately to keeping my water bottle either on the passenger seat, where it is liable to roll off, or in my backpack, where it's more difficult to access while driving. For medium- and small-sized water bottles though, the storage options are more than adequate, and I appreciate how well the auto-adjusting cup grips work for the center-front cup holders; their grip and stability inspire much more confidence when I put a large coffee or something else I really don't want to spill in the cup holder -- my Yaris cupholder often led to minor spills all over the cup holder and onto the floor whenever I hit a road bump, so these cupholders are an appreciable upgrade.

Adjustable steering wheel works as you would expect and is comparatively much easier to find a comfortable position for it than the seats.

Quite possibly my favorite aspect of the ES' interior is how (subjectively) intuitive its layout and ease-of-use is. I was pretty intimidated by the possible learning curve of upgrading from a 2010 rust bucket beater to a mid-end Luxury sedan at first, but every feature and setting of the ES has been a breeze to adjust and understand. The dash layout, steering wheel buttons, climate controls, and infotainment are exactly where I would expect them to be, and almost nothing that I frequently need to access is hidden in the infotainment. Especially appreciated are the physical climate controls which I think are very aesthetically pleasing, and the temperature switches are super tactile and satisfying to use. Only thing I would like moved, or have the option to move, to physical controls is audio equalizer/tuning settings. On my Yaris, pressing the tuning knob would let you have quick access to tuning the bass and treble on the audio; doing this on the ES just stops/starts your music. Still though, audio tuning settings are quickly accessed through the physical ""Media"" button on the dash, then just doing one tap on the infotainment screen to open audio tuning settings. Steering wheel buttons are also super easy to get the hang of, and I very much appreciate that all the car's safety settings can be adjusted to the left of the gauge cluster rather than having to open the infotainment.

Lastly, I have not driven the ES with stock sound system for comparison, so I can't speak to whether the ML system is ""worth it"" for the price, but the audio quality is extremely impressive. Minimal reverb and harmonic distortion (as long as you're not cranking the bass to max in tuning settings, which sounds like shit anyway so like, don't do that lol) and frequency response sounds excellent to my ears. I have a 5.1 Dolby Atmos surround setup, high-quality bookshelf speakers, and high-quality open back headphones with a discrete headphone amp and DAC at home, and even compared to all of those, the ML system holds up very well.

# Driving Experience

If you're like me and appreciate a quiet, relaxing, and smooth commute to and from work each day, you will fall in love with the ES immediately. I genuinely went from dreading my 30-60min long commute in the Yaris every day to being excited to relax in my perfectly adjusted, ventilated seat while the ES cruises with ease on the highway and in stop-and-go traffic alike; with one of my favorite podcasts or albums on, driving is genuinely a *passive* experience. To me, true luxury is not having to even think about driving, which is normally a mundane and tedious task. With the radar cruise control tuned in just right, I sometimes am in awe of how I can't remember a single thing about my drive to/from work when I get home; it's more like I got to sit in a comfy recliner, listening to my favorite new podcast episodes and albums for an hour than commuting.

This is my first time driving a hybrid, so I don't have a comparison point to reference, but they hybrid system in the ES 300h feels excellently tuned to me. I have become obsessed with maximizing the car's efficiency and watching the power monitor in the gauge cluster is super satisfying to watch as I have improved at using regenerative breaking and gradual acceleration & deceleration to optimize the charging of the battery.

Reading reviews of the ES beforehand, I was expecting to be a little disappointed by the driving dynamics and acceleration of it, but coming from a Yaris the ES is wayyyy more responsive and quick to accelerate than I would have expected. Obviously, if you're coming from anything other than a 4 cylinder, the ES is going to feel underpowered, but for practical purposes it is way more than enough car to get up to highway speeds when merging and make quick lane shifts when needed. I was surprised to find that I do actually use the sport mode a decent amount when merging or changing lanes, as it makes the torque available a lot faster when pressing the pedal. I definitely would NOT recommend running the ES 300h in sport mode constantly as that will kill your fuel efficiency, which kinda defeats the purpose of owning a hybrid IMO, but it is still a nice-to-have.

As far as the other driving modes go, just keep the ES in normal mode 99% of the time. I tested staying mostly in eco mode for like 100miles and got almost exactly the same MPG as I did in Normal mode for the other 300 or so miles of my driving thus far. Eco mode just makes the car feel sluggish and makes it so you have to press the pedal much harder to get up to highway speeds. If you like a *very* gradual acceleration, maybe you'll like eco mode, but for me it just feels worse to drive and doesn't make much difference in efficiency.

# Conclusion

The above are all the features, quirks, and nitpicks that have stood out to me the most in my roughly \~1 month ownership period with the car thus far. I obviously cannot comment on things like reliability yet, but hoping that Lexus' reputation for reliability will hold true for my beloved ES.

Hopefully this perspective will be helpful for people thinking of buying the ES that are coming from a similar position as me in terms of 1) Using their car more as a practical tool than a joyriding machine and 2) Wanting a serene and relaxing commuting experience on a daily basis.

Feel free to comment with any questions if there are other aspects of the car that I haven't touched on that people are interested in. Cheers.",3,1731346182.0,Lexus,1,0.8,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

Here are mine in case anyone was wondering

**Lip pencils**

**Plum** this is my number one favourite. I use it with so many shades nudes, berries and muted reds. If a color is not quite right for me plum will fix it.

**Whirl** this also has a bit of a plummy tone, but it’s much cooler than plum so I use it when I want a pouty lip.

**Ruby woo** this goes with pretty much any bright red because it doesn’t lean to warm or too cool.

Lipsticks 

**Red rock** this is in the macximal matte formula which is my favorite formula by mac and it’s more of a velvet than a true matte. The shade is a perfect bright neutral red with a hint of white so it’s great if you have fair skin like me.

**Forever curious** another macximal matte. This one is a good alternative to a true red it’s a bright reddish coral.

**business casual** this is a lustreglass my second favourite formula by Mac it’s very hydrating and smoothing and it has a beautiful shine. This is a nude red with a hint of pink. 

**Hug me** another lustreglass it’s a light medium warm taupe coral nude. 

**creme in your coffee** this is in the new macximal sleek satin formula. It’s a shade that is a bit hard to describe, but it leans cooler on me. The formula is nice but I do prefer the macximal mattes over it it’s more smoothing on the lip lines. ",3,1731345752.0,Makeup,4,0.8,False

Here’s my setup so far:

• Normal home office/gaming station that’s a few years old now with dual monitors and a docking station if I need to hookup my MacBook Air.

• Single monitor for work with laptop docking station that I will also use to connect anything that is normally headless.

• Prodesk 600 G3 SFF with proxmox that will probably be the main workhorse with a bunch of VMs to install and tinker with. Currently had to spin up an OPNsense instance to take over network duties.

• M920q tiny that will be the dedicated opnsense box once I get some more components in then configure it.

• Optiplex 9020 MT that will be my dedicated NAS once I get more components in for that as well.

Things I want to work on:

1. Do a few cable drops and replace the pair of XT8’s I am using as AP’s with wireless backhaul.

2. Get a UPS(s).

3. Cable management and find a solution to make everything look a little more…prettier.

4. Get rid of that damn couch (sorry dogs, I’ll get them a dog bed) and coffee table.

Tanong ko lang sa inyo.. may utos ba na bawal mag-asawa??? ito sabi ni Apostol Pablo sa 1 Corinto 7..

***Ngayon, tungkol sa mga dalaga ay ""wala akong utos ng Panginoon"": nguni't ""ibinibigay ko ang aking pasiya"", na tulad sa nagkamit ng habag ng Panginoon upang mapagkatiwalaan.***

***Datapuwa't, dahil sa mga pakikiapid, ang bawa't lalake ay magkaroon ng kaniyang sariling asawa, at bawa't babae ay magkaroon ng kaniyang sariling asawa.***

# Nguni't ito'y sinasabi ko na parang payo, hindi sa utos.

Walang utos na bawal mag asawa.. payo lang yun ni Apostol Pablo..

1 Timoteo 4:1-3

*Nguni't hayag na sinasabi ng Espiritu, na sa mga huling panahon ang iba'y magsisitalikod sa pananampalataya, at mangakikinig sa mga espiritung mapanghikayat at sa mga aral ng mga demonio,*

*Sa pamamagitan ng pagpapaimbabaw ng mga tao na nagsisipagsalita ng mga kasinungalingan, na hinerohan ang kanilang mga sariling budhi ng waring bakal na nagbabaga;*

***Na ipinagbabawal ang pagaasawa***\*, at ipinaguutos na lumayo sa mga lamangkati, na nilalang ng Dios upang tanggapin na may pagpapasalamat ng mga nagsisisampalataya at nangakakaalam ng katotohanan.\*

WALANG UTOS NA BAWAL MAG ASAWA.. YUNG NAGBABAWAL NG PAG AASAWA.. HINDI YUN ANG ARAL NA NASA BIBLIA

**1 Corinto 7:28**  
***Nguni't kung ikaw ay magasawa, ay hindi ka nagkakasala; at kung ang isang dalaga ay magasawa, ay hindi siya nagkakasala. Datapuwa't ang mga gayon ay magkakaroon ng kahirapan sa laman: at ibig ko sanang kayo'y iligtas.***

I am one of those “functioning” alcoholics who never got a dui or had issues at work. I would hide and sneak alcohol, predrink before going to social events, and continue drinking alone when I got home. I usually drank at home quietly every single night, thinking it was hurting nobody. That bled into drinking during the day, operating with a slight buzz all of the time. And by the time I went to bed I’d be wasted, which was the only way I could sleep.

I went to great and shameful lengths to try to hide my addiction. Throwing cans away at gas stations before I got home, mixing drinks in soda bottles or filling my coffee mug with malt liquor. While still operating as a somewhat successful employee, husband and father. I see people like me all of the time. I used to deny that I was an alcoholic because I had things that I didn’t think an alcoholic would have. And what I’ve learned is alcoholism does not usually look like the caricature we believe it to be. It is a quiet, subtle hell that anyone can be living in

Drinking was holding me back from being the person that I wanted to be. While it hurt my family and those closest to me, it was destroying ME the most. I had no confidence to advocate for myself, to say no to people, to try new things. It felt like I was a shell of a person just barely surviving.

What worked for me getting sober was recognizing that alcohol’s influence on my decision making up until this point in my life led me to a place where I was absolutely miserable, and it wasn’t getting any better. I was getting divorced, I was broke, 100 pounds overweight, hated my job, had low self esteem and very few friends who cared for me. I decided that for the next year, no matter what happens in my life, if I remain sober, it will be a successful year. And it worked. 

I lost 90 pounds, changed careers, dated with healthy boundaries, confronted my past behaviors, and let myself feel ALL of the guilt and shame (which is painful yet cathartic). I went through a six month ice cream and brownie binging phase. I had to cut off relationships with a few old friends, and built new friendships with some great people. I’m a much better parent and my kids feel more comfortable with me. It’s not all sunshine, but life never is. I can handle the bumps a lot easier with a clear mind every single time and will grow from my mistakes. Getting sober was the single best thing I’ve ever done for myself and I will never go back to where I was.

It worked great for 3 years (of course after the warranty was expired), and then in 2023, I smelled smoking plastic. I looked inside it and saw that one of the connectors to the brew thermostat was melted. I let the machine sit for a little over a year before I got brave enough to try to fix it. I replaced the 2 spade connectors that go to the brew thermostat (and got upgraded spade connector insulating covers (can't remember what they are called, but got them from Stafano's as recommended on this site), as well as both thermostats since they are easy to swap out and then I'd know they were the same age.  After that fix, the machine can brew coffee again without smoking, but now there is a leak. It starts shortly after I turn on the machine, drips slowly as the coffee brews, but slows down when steaming the milk, and is completely stops leaking after I am done steaming, even though the machine is still powered on in the same way as when it initially starts leaking. I put in a silicone gasket for the portafilter about a month after I got the machine, but it did sit for a year while it was broken, mostly without the portafilter screwed in. Did I break something else while jamming my hand into the machine to swap out the brew thermostat?  When I look inside it while it's leaking, I can't see any water anywhere. I'm not much of an engineer and am not sure how much more I could disassemble this machine to fix whatever is wrong now.

It’s been a big mental challenge for me. 
My heart failure came out of nowhere over the summer. Before my event I was 195lbs (5’9”) and trained 6 days a week. I was in the hospital for 4 months and lost over 50lbs. Not only did my body eat away all my muscle but when I was on ECMO they damaged my thigh muscle and when I later had an impella installed they damaged about 40% of my right pec muscle. My care team has been helping me cope with the fact I’ll never be able to perform the way I did before, but can get some back. 
The process has been overwhelmingly defeating but I’m determined to find my new capabilities. 
My question- I’m having a very hard time with energy. My care team said I can never take any type of preworkout ever again, and said just drink coffee before working out. I hate coffee.

1gox8ys,https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1gox8ys/i_came_into_this_alpha_completely_fresh_with_no/,I came into this Alpha completely fresh with no expectations. These are my thoughts after my 1st weekend of testing.,"For context, my level of familiarity with Ashes is based entirely off of the last few live streams. I read about the node system and the design philosophy, but outside of a basic understanding that this is an MMO made in the image of old school MMOs, I didn't know anything about it. I have played World of Warcraft (both classic and retail, though recently exclusively classic) since 2006 and dabbled in RIFT, SWTOR, and LOTRO. I took notes as I played. 

***Character Creation:***

I don't think the character creator and races are fully implemented in the Alpha so I'm not going to make any kind of judgment on those other than to say that I think it is important to remember that the character creation process is your FIRST chance to make an impression on a player so hold nothing back. Make the character creation really robust and it will pay dividends.  

I made a female Empyrian Ranger. I have mained Hunter in WoW for 18 years so I wanted to start with something that felt comfortable and familiar. 

  
***Initial Load-in and first 10mins of gameplay;*** 

Not gonna lie, this part was rough. I dont know if it was just because there were a lot of people logging on at the same time, but I got into the game and it was immediately a laggy choppy mess. But this is an Alpha, nothing that I wasn't expecting. I alt+f4'd and decided to make a cup of coffee and come back in 15mins. To my surprise my second log-in was much much smoother. Everything loaded fine, frame rate was steady, time to get into it. I see a very traditional single player RPG style action button diamond on my screen. The button mapping is pretty intuitive. F to interact, I have a dodge and a sprint, and a block. Okay that's immediately more action oriented than im used to, but as I start moving around and trying stuff out it actually feels very good. Its feels VERY VERY good actually. I'm immediately taken back to Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, a game which while ultimately a failure as an MMO, had some really impressive elements including its MOVEMENT and ACTION combat system. This feels like that and that is a really good thing.  

I start talking to NPCs and immediately things are less good. The AI voice over is atrocious. If your choice is between bad AI voiceover and no voiceover, just don't have voiceover at all. The world LOOKS really cool and I'm sure that the developers have many stories that they want to tell in it. SWOTR was really ambitious with its quest dialogue and Baldurs Gate 3 set the bar for RPG storytelling in the modern era, but I think it would be a mistake to try and emulate those games if it wasn't part of the initial design philosophy. Design a better quest dialogue box, entice players to read about the world if they want to dive into it. 

I accidentally picked up a sword off the ground and realized that there were basic versions of all the weapons scattered around the room. Interactable items need to be made way more obvious for players. This was one of the 1st things I noticed and it did NOT get any better as I got deeper into the game, if anything it got way worse. After running around the starting room and talking/interacting with everyone, I realized that there was nothing else there except the starting weapons and a single quest to go to one of the next two towns and maybe kill some goblins on the way. However, I was almost immediately side tracked by one of the the things that I think this game REALLY isn't taking advantage of and should be. THE GAME WORLD!!! 

Because the movement feels so good, one of the first things I did was start EXPLORING and I have to say that I was pretty impressed with the size and scope of the starting area. There is a TON of verticality and great little nooks and crannies tucked away all across the starting area. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD USE THEM! Reward players for exploring, put some lore interactable items, some hidden items, some cosmetics. Just cram as much STUFF as humanly possible into these zones because they are amazing. As a player, when I see a broken tower or a hidden area I immediately have to figure out how to get there. Nothing is more disappointing than solving the puzzle of how to get there and then finding nothing there. Nothing feels better than getting there and being rewarded with something nice. I learned later that this applies to every zone in the game. If you do NOTHING ELSE, make sure you do THIS and people will play this game even if all they do is explore the world.  

***The rest of the test;*** 

After exploring the starting zone and realizing that it was basically empty, I decided to head towards Lionhold. Upon encountering the 1st goblin hyper spawn area I decided to spend some time learning about the combat system. I've been told that this game is all about grinding mobs so I decided to grind goblins to level 3 and figure out how my class worked. And here I was again pleasantly surprised. The archetype points and the weapon trees are actually implemented well. As I read through my talents I was happy to see that I was immediately presented with several skill choices, some passive some active, but I WANTED all of them and making a choice felt impactful. I quickly realized that there was synergy between the weapons and the archetype talents and I decided that since I was gonna grind goblins for a while anyway I would just try everything. It all felt like it meshed. Even at level 3 I could see 4 or 5 different combinations of talents and weapons that all felt viable and unique. I REALLY felt like I could sink my teeth into this system. The abilities all felt weighty and impactful, the synergies were easy to understand and everything was fluid. The ranger ability Disengage immediately caught my attention as its flashy animation felt glorious to use and added verticality and a lot of control to my movement as a Ranger. I immediately started experimenting with using it as an explorations tool and was happy to learn that I could in fact use it to get up onto high places and create huge distance for kiting enemies. Scatter Shot? Also amazing. useful as both an AOE and a powerful straight line nuke with penetration, but requires skill to get the maximum payoff and the failure state is that you miss and do 0 damage. Pretty much a perfectly designed ability. I got the Ranger figured out, on to Lionhold.

At this point I'm gonna fast forward completely through the end because my experience from the point of getting to Lionhold all the way through to the end of my testing was pretty homogenous. I alternated pretty regularly between a state of being completely overwhelmed and utterly confused. The chat UI, the quest UI, the Map, and all the other windows need a massive amount of work. The game is designed to be social, but the tools for facilitation social interaction are anemic, they need to be beefed up substantially. The quests and commissions do a pretty awful job telling you where to go and what to do. I spent at least an hour trying to do The Warhelm Curse and A Proper Burial before giving up because I simply could not find anyone or anything inside the quest area that would move either one of them forward. Once I decided to skip any quests that weren't ""go here and kill a thing"" My experience improved greatly because I was back to doing mostly combat and the combat is very very good. It took me 4 hours to realize that selling glint is how you get silver and only because I asked someone in my party. I found a bunch of rare materials, but couldn't find a use for them. I found a bunch of recipes for River Stalker armor that I wanted to craft, but I couldn't figure out how to become a tanner so I could make the items I needed. According to the game I am a tanner, but I had no recipes, I think my next play session I will try and figure out how to level professions.   

Once again I was impressed by the size and scope of the world, but I learned early on that it is mostly empty and there is no point to exploring it. I think the game would really benefit from putting a big focus on exploration and rewarding players for doing it because the game world is just absolutely perfect for it, especially all the verticality. Give classes lots of cool movement abilities, let them fly, jump, dash, and glide all over the goddamn map and reward them for doing it. 

***Conclusions;*** 

Overall potential is very high. 

Game world and massive map is a huge asset that is being under utilized. 

Archetype talents and weapon trees are in a good place (at least for ranger) 

Combat and Movement are the games strongest features at this point in time. Could be even BETTER if movement is integrated with game world to allow players to interact and explore the map. 

With so many overlapping systems, onboarding new players is going to be a real challenge. Tutorial and quick tip people have their work cut out for them.

1gox7bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoRulesCalgary/comments/1gox7bo/my_wife_and_i_want_to_go_pet_some_puppies/,My Wife and I Want to Go Pet Some Puppies,"For whatever reason my post was removed from the official Calgary subreddit, I guess they hate dogs and want them all dead or something.

Straight up, my wife and I want to go pet some dogs, lie down on our backs and get mauled by some doggos. Top dog shop is closed forever (good I guess) and other searches on google keep linking shelters but it looks like that’s like a week long process to be vetted to pet some puppies, but at that point it looks like you’ll actually have to do work which I’m good.

Straight up, we want to just spontaneously be able to go, “let’s go pet some dogs you down?” And she’ll go like “yeh let’s bounce” and we get up drive to somewhere, arrive and just be like “we’re here to chill with some dogs and pat some pot bellies and shit” and just melt away with some good bois and gorls.

In a city as large as this why tf is that so hard

Other people said possibly dog parks, but that sounds kinda weird and idk if Calgarians are chill like that tbh. Like we show up with no dog and just essentially just start petting what is essentially peoples children randomly. Idk is that weird cause that’s basically what we would be doing. Like hey everyone we don’t own a dog so we’re just gonna invite ourselves to pet and cuddle your dogs thanks bye

Ps. We can’t get a dog with where we live and we don’t want human interaction with other people we know who have dogs hence this quest. 

We’re just here for da dogs man that’s all. 

Where can we go do this. Someone start a business please, a coffee shop or something like damn. ",4,1731344798.0,NoRulesCalgary,7,0.7,False
1gox6ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gox6ea/hissing/,HISSING,"

I sat looking out my window, my room was freezing and I was under my blanket sitting on my chair just watching. There had been strange noises passing for the past hour or so. Outside seemed normal, just the houses across the road and the occasional dog walker going by. They’d be clenching the leash as the dogs would start barking when they past this same part on the pavement, which was odd but the dogs round here usually bark for no real reason. It looked like the cold weather had been working away, cracking the pathways and causing potholes on the road, just the usual thing that happens each year during winter.  There was a hissing sound, occasionally coming from somewhere outside and I must’ve been the only one to notice it as I didn’t see anyone else looking out their windows. It was sparkling outside due to the frost. The street lights occasionally flickering every ten minutes or so. I felt like something was off, but couldn’t really tell if it was just me scaring myself by thinking too much about it. I watched for another hour, the intermittent Hissing seemed to have gone now but it was hard to tell, as it felt like it was still going on in my head, but a lot quieter now. I decided to close the curtains and climbed back in to bed.

In the morning I looked outside, it was still dark. It was six when I decided to get up. My partner was downstairs already getting himself ready for work. I heard the noise of the milk frother screeching as he made his coffee. My two kids were still asleep in their beds, thankfully they hadn’t kept me up last night, however I would’ve preferred that over the strange hissing from outside. I went downstairs light shining out from the kitchen doorway, my partner now making himself a bowl of cereal.

‘Fuck sake, every fucking day. everyday I get up and spill something, god damn what is wrong with me?’

my partner was talking to himself annoyed about his accident, I entered the kitchen my partner had spilt some coffee over his white shirt. 

‘You alright’ I said, he looked over at me and smiled.

‘Yeah, just the usual, spilling my coffee on myself like a fool’

‘Should be some shirts upstairs that are dry now’

‘Nah it’s alright I’ll just put a jumper on over it’

he picked up a towel and was rubbing the coffee mark into his shirt

‘did you get much sleep last night? kids didn’t wake up during the night did they?’

‘Nah the kids slept all night’

‘Well that’s good. woke up at four today and couldn’t get back to sleep so just came downstairs’

‘yeah. I had issues falling asleep last night, which is annoying cause the kids actually slept through the night’

my partner looked at me eyebrows heightened in a concerned way. he looked down and shrugged his shoulders

‘Yeah, I dunno’

‘Heard a weird noise too, like a hissing sound coming from outside I think’ 

he took a small sip from his coffee

‘have you heard anything this morning?’

‘Nah. was probably nothing, probably just my imagination playing tricks on me, thinking too much again’

he opened the drawer to the cutlery and took out a spoon, then poured some Milk over his cereal and ate a spoonful.

‘Maybe it was the pipes or something heating up the radiators, sometimes they sound like they are hissing’

‘Nah it was more like a snake hiss or something like that, it was intermittent… I dunno it was strange never heard it before just kept me up for about two hours. so I’ve had like five hours sleep I think’

‘Sounds terrible’

My partner took his cereal and coffee and went to sit down at the table, he took out his phone and started scrolling through the news

‘News always makes me feel miserable in the morning’


—————————————————————

You sssssssee me

I woke up, my head was sore throbbing I needed water my mouth was dry

Sssssssseeeeeee meeeeee

What, what is it what’s wrong who is that by the door who’s there who is it who are you, what do you want, where… AAaaaaah no no no no no nonononononono noooo noooo.

—————————————————————



I woke up, soaked in sweat my partner was snoring beside me, I went to check on the kids both still asleep. I went down stairs and turned on the lights to the living room and kitchen. I poured myself a glass of water. Just a nightmare… just a terrible, terrible nightmare. I brushed my teeth as my mouth felt gross and tasted funny. 

“Muuuuuum, mum, mummmy” 

I jumped out my seat my daughter had woken up, shouting for me, I checked the time it was two AM, I went upstairs and got in to my daughters bed.

‘What’s up my angel’

I hugged her 

‘it’s still very late in the night we gotta get some more sleep’

My daughter was staring at me and started falling asleep again.

»

Birds were singing outside when I woke, my partner was downstairs doing his usual routine. Both the kids still sleeping I silently climbed out my daughters bed and went downstairs.

‘Where did I put that again’ 

my partner talking to himself again 

‘I thought I’d put it right here god dammit, what is going on with my brain It must be fucking melting away in my skull’ 

I entered the kitchen 

‘What you looking for?’

My partner jumped and turned around

‘Woah, you trying to kill me’ he joked ‘just the key to the storage box outside, one of my bike tires is flat, need to pump it up otherwise I’ll be walking, which will take ages and be incredibly dull, and freezing’

I looked around, the key was above the sink on the windowsill, I pointed saying

‘There they are, clearly you have your man eyes on today’ I joked

‘Unfortunately so’ 

he remarked smirking, slightly embarrassed by them being right in front of him. He took the keys and went outside to pump up his bike tyre. I sat down and drank the cup of water I had poured last night. I felt strange today, just this feeling of sadness caused by that nightmare. My partner came back inside and put the key back on the windowsill.

‘Few. well thankfully it was just a flat tire and not any holes, so that saves me time.’

He took a sip of his coffee and a spoonful of his cereal 

‘I take it you came downstairs last night or was it one of the kids? just cause the lights were on when I came down’

‘Yeah, it was me I just had a nightmare’

‘Was it that bad?’

‘Yeah it was terrifying, a slivering creature was slowly devouring you and the kids and I wanted to save you all but… I was helpless I couldn’t move but I wanted to move and the snake kept hissing  saying “you see me, see me” I don’t really know why but it’s just left me feeling weird, there was something else in the dream but I can’t really make an image or remember what’

‘Sounds scary. And yesterday you said you heard hissing, hmm maybe it’s a sign or something, not that I believe in signs or paranormal stuff.’ 

he shrugged his shoulders ’I dunno’

My partner went over to the counter and started preparing his lunchbox. 

‘Well todays a short day, so won’t be away too long, you gonna be alright?’ 

He looked at me eyebrows raised 

‘Yeah, it was just a dream. My mums coming over today so might be able to sort out the kids room and get rid some of the toys they don’t play with anymore, until they see them and start playing with them again’

He laughed ‘yeah, you’ll have to sneakily get rid of them, kids always start loving the toys they’ve forgotten existed’ 

His alarm on his phone went off 

‘well I’d best be off. just text if you need anything from the shops’ 

he smiled gave me a kiss and left for work 

‘see you at four’

I looked down at my phone a message from my mum saying she’d be here in about two hours.

»

‘Would you want to have a new sole on this shoe as well?’ her partner was talking to one of the regulars an old lady who comes in once or twice a week

‘Hmmm how much is it for that?’ The old lady squinting her eyes

‘It’s an extra ten pounds’ 

‘Alright, probably best getting a new soul’ the customer laughed 

‘Yeah’ he replied smiling politely not really understanding what she was laughing about

‘How’s the family?’

‘Eh they’re alright’ 

he replied whilst putting the exchange through the till 

‘partners been having odd dreams the past two days, but other than that everyone’s pretty good’

‘Oh what’s been happening with your partner?’

‘Just strange noises like a hissing, she said and a terrible dream where we were swallowed by a snake or something’

The customers eyes widened, she looked just past him and started muttering to herself, it was hard to make it out under her breath, he thought she said “see me”, but wasn’t entirely sure. He stepped back from the counter and frowned. The customer snapped back to acting normal and looked at him confused.

‘So when shall I pick these back up’

‘Ehm’ 

He started to feel warm, dizzy and sick, he put a hand to his head 

‘probably tomorrow, todays a short day so will be shut earlier, won’t have time to finish them today’

‘That’s completely fine I’ll be back in tomorrow, is the afternoon alright?’ 

‘Yup’ he replied quickly

The customer turned and left, the door clanging against the bell on her way out. He jumped the counter and locked the door. He looked around the shop feeling more and more dizzy, he felt he was going to throw up.

‘God damn, what is going on? What is going on?’ 

He threw up on the floor, in his vomit he saw something sliver away but his vision was blurred, he threw up again and fell over into it.

»

I came to the shop, this was not like him to be soo late, it had been about an hour and half since he finished, I walked up to the door and knocked. the lights were still on so he must be in. I peered through the window and saw the shadow of something moving.

A woman was walking down the road towards me, she was waving her arms to me, then she shouted

‘Hello, he closes early on Sundays, he seemed to be unwell when I came in earlier to drop off some shoes’

‘Oh, I’m his partner, em… he hasn’t came back home yet’ 

I looked through the window again and saw his bike sitting against the radiator so he was definitely still here

‘he must be still in there’ 

I started looking through my bag for the spare key to the shop

‘shit, I must have left it at home’

The woman now right next to me, raise her eyebrows and stared at me ‘left what?’ 

‘I’m not trying to be rude, but could you step back a little, I’m just not comfortable with people getting to close to me, especially strangers. sorry’ 

The women stepped back looking a bit annoyed but managed to smile politely

‘oh sorry I didn’t mean to get so close I understand, is this ok’ 

She was now about four feet away from me 

‘yeah that’s fine’ 

I felt her eyes looking at me too much, something wasn’t right about her but then that’s sometimes normal round here. she’s an old lady so I didn’t feel too threatened but she still unnerved me with her staring. 

I took out my phone and rang my partner again, I could hear the vibrating of it in the shop, I felt sick. This old lady was still standing there just watching me, I looked at her and said
 
‘I’ll be alright, you can go do whatever you were going to do’

she turned round and walked away occasionally looking back at me as she left. I decided to go sit in the car and call my mum to ask if she could bring the keys.

‘Hi, mum can you bring the keys for the shop they should be hanging up next to the door’

‘Yeah, is everything alright?’

‘I’m not sure, I just can’t get in to the shop, something doesn’t feel right’

‘Oh, I’ll be there as quick as I can, after rounding up these kids’ 

I listened down the phone and could hear my kids making up stories with their toys my mum telling them to quickly get their shoes on and jump in the car to go to daddies work, the kids yelled in synchrony “yay daddies work” 

‘okay sweetheart see you soon’ 

she hung up.

Just when my mum hung up the hissing started again, this time coming from behind me, I froze I wanted to look but I was too scared ,I could smell fish and meat, the air felt weirdly humid I looked in the rear view mirror but there was nothing there, then I turned around 

‘oh god, please god help me, help me god, please god please’

» 

The mother came with the kids, she was keeping up a chirpy tone as she drove past her daughters car, it wasn’t right. she stared, blood was oozing from the doors seams, she thought about pulling over but drove on, the kids were telling her that she’s just drove past their dads work. She sighed then replied 

‘We can’t go to your dads work kids, we’ve got to go pack up your things at home, you’ve been chosen’ 

A tear ran down the mothers cheek as she drove down the icy road. The kids in the back were conversing happily with one another

‘Do you want to go to daddy’s work brotha?’

‘Yeah a do, yeah a do sister’

In synchrony they start singing and bobbing along

‘let’s go to daddies work, let’s go to daddies work, let’s go to daddies work’

1gox3e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/restaurant/comments/1gox3e6/disappointed_greek_restaurant_in_nyc/,Disappointed Greek restaurant in NYC,"I went to a Greek restaurant yesterday in the Upper West Side for lunch with family and friends. It wasn’t a pleasant experience.

After walking in the city for 5 hours, I was starving like a bear just waking up from hibernation. We decided to go to this place to enjoy what we expected to be a gourmet lunch. Upon arrival, we didn’t have a reservation, but somehow we were seated immediately, even though the restaurant was half full. So I thought it was going to be good!

But ‘Noooooooo!’

After we sat down, we didn’t get any service for 10 minutes. As soon as the waiter took our drink order, he immediately left without asking if we wanted to order anything else. I was actually expecting to place our main course order since we were hungry and ready to order.

Anyway, another 5-10 minutes passed, the drinks arrived, and the waiter finally took our main course order. While we were waiting for the food, the manager or the owner was consistently talking to the next table. I guess he knew the people at that table, which was completely fine and didn’t bother us at all.

Somehow, all of a sudden, he decided to turn around and ask us, ‘How’s everything?’ while our table had nothing but only 4 cups of coffee. We seriously didn’t know how to answer and just smiled and said, ‘Good, and we are still waiting for the food.’

He then realized we were waiting for food, not finished with our food. He smiled awkwardly and left us.

Ok, back to the ordering. I don’t usually go to Greek restaurants, and I definitely wanted something special/authentic. However, the entrée menu was mostly steak and brunch food. So I decided to go with their so-called ‘classic’ menu.

First of all, I accept it’s my own fault that I didn’t Google the cooking know-how for the dish names that I didn’t know. I ordered the salmon ‘crudo’. The reason I picked it was because its price was somewhat similar to the price of the entrée steak and eggs, smoked salmon benedict, and so on. The salmon crudo description was: Salmon, shallot, cucumber, jalapenos, cilantro, shallots, finger lime…

After 30 to 45 minutes from we sat down.     The dish finally arrived,

Drum roll……. Wait….. what …? I was like, ‘WTF. This is it!?’

 Ok, it’s a raw fish dish. Don’t get me wrong, I have no problem with raw fish; I love sashimi. The real problem was that there were only 6 pieces of thumb-sized fish slices with a drizzle of sauce and ‘NOTHING’ else. Yes, all the vegetables mentioned in the menu description had turned into the fabulous-looking liquid – the sauce.

My point is, this is not an entrée or main course. This is an appetizer, and even a 10-year-old kid wouldn’t feel full with this dish. The waiter didn’t even mention a word to me while we were placing the order. He didn’t tell me it wasn’t a main course or ask if I wanted a main course. In that case, I would have known it is a freaky ‘not even enough for a kid’s meal.’

I was so disappointed and still hungry. My wife suggested that I order more food, but I wasn’t happy with the service, to be honest, so I didn’t. We finished the food, and I left the restaurant with an almost empty stomach",0,1731344548.0,restaurant,15,0.29,False

I know the expensive hotel restaurants like Café Boulud and Bosk are quite spacious and usually not completely full at breakfast or brunch.

The AGO restaurant is also quite spacious with tables set apart, but it can be very full on weekends. I haven't been since the restaurant was still called Frank. Has anyone been lately?


Can you think of any restaurants that serve a good brunch that are spacious? 

In terms of coffee shops that are spacious inside, I find the B Espresso at the Royal Conservatory, the Dark Horse on St Clair W near Dufferin, the Balzac's at the Distillery and the Balzac's at the Powerhouse (Dovercourt between St Clair and Dupont) to be more spacious than most, and not too crowded if you go early.

Lately though, I can't stop staring, but the thing is, it's not sexual at all. Men are just so *pretty.* I was talking to a guy and his friend yesterday and it was hard to concentrate.

A chance meeting has led a local coffee connoisseur into launching a new blend celebrating his Midwestern roots.

[Ryan Woldt](https://open.substack.com/users/18232472-ryan-woldt?utm_source=mentions), who lives in Carlsbad and covers coffee through his [Roast! West Coast](https://open.substack.com/pub/roastwestcoast) publication on Substack along with hosting the “[Coffee People Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/coffee-people-podcast/id1534939445),” and Bryant Banker-Scannell, owner and roaster of Relative Coffee, joined forces to release a new coffee blend celebrating their Midwestern origins. Woldt, who is originally from Wisconsin, and Banker-Scannell, who lives in Minneapolis, hit it off upon meeting and built a story around their coffee as a tribute to the affable, down-to-earth and folksy style of the Midwest.

The duo calls their blend, “Yeah, no … Yeah,” which in the Midwest is often a substitute for “yes.” The two figured there was no better brand name than “[Yeah, no … Yeah](https://relativecoffeeco.com/products/yeah-no-yeah)” for their collaboration.

1gowoji,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gowoji/two_falls_a_postmortem/,Two Falls: A post-Mortem,"Hi everyone!

My name is Sam. I worked as Creative Director and Lead Design on a game called Two Falls. It released last friday after a whole six years of development and a bit of a crazy adventure.

With my personal reddit account, I'm a lurker of gamedev. I know that the crowd is mostly focused on solo devs and small teams. But I often see questions or interest into how others work, especially bigger ""more organized"" teams. Not huge studios, but bigger teams.

I talked to the mods of /r/gamedev and they said that a postmortem was a better format than an AMA. However, I still invite you all to ask your questions if you have them, we are an open book!

Two Falls was developed by Unreliable Narrators. We're a studio of about 12 people. To explain a bit how we got here, I'll tell our story and I'll fork into some of our challenges, lessons.


#**2018 - The Start**

Affordance Studio is a Montreal-located studio that focuses on serious games. It mostly does service and has the tagline *We create games to change the world""*. One of its founders also teaches game design. In 2016 I enrolled in the program and we quickly bonded. When I graduated, it took a few months, but we found each other again and I joined their team.

Now, Affordance works with banks, schools, small businesses. It makes games to help kids learn their math, to help indigenous people improve their financial literacy, etc. It's a noble line of work. Through it, the team developed an expertise of collaborative development. Marrying game design with a subject matter taught by an expert (let's say a teacher, or psychologist) is a huge challenge. Balancing making the game fun, and educative is a very delicate matter. But when I joined in 2018, the team already had six years of experience and some moderately big projects under its wing. The team was mostly using web technologies for their accessibility.

Around the same time, my boss told me that the studio had received a small grant to develop a prototype for a game on the culture of the first nations (indigenous). The studio had the necessary experience to work with consultants and partners, and it fit the studio's ethos. Having a literature background, I was offered to work on it.

Now at the time, my intentions were to spend a few years to make games and eventually shifty into a solo dev career. But this was an interesting opportunity. We wanted to keep the game small.

So, with two interns we worked for about two months to make a quick prototype. Having played Firewatch the year before, we decided to go for the first-person narrative genre. It seemed like a good balance in term of scope. We used Unity.

With this prototype, we applied for a larger grant. It took several months to prepare for the application and to get the response. A bit of a spoiler but we did get a large grant in August 2019. But I'm skipping a bit ahead.

> *Lesson 1: Financing is not especially difficult. But it is boring work. You have to spend time to look for grants and other opportunities. There's a lot of paperwork. But it has to be done. Also, networking can really help in this. Contacts can tell you able which grants are worth it, opportunities you didn't know about, etc.*


#**2019 - Finding partners**

As we worked on our application for the grant, we sat down and really thought on how we should do this project. For those outside of Canada, the relations between Canada and its first nations we're quite tense at this time. The territory of Canada has a nasty history of cultural genocide mixed with the catholic church. At the time, the news were full of reports of finding burial sites full of indigenous children bones.

We talked with indigenous artists in our network and we were warned of the challenges ahead. Indigenous artists are very often approached by businesses or creators of european descent to do projects focused in indigenous culture; but most often than not, indigenous names are added to credits as consultants, but they have very little insight in the project. We did not want to go down this road.

At this time, we reached out to a well known Wendat Ethnologist named Isabelle Picard. We explained to her our situation and what our intentions were. Our discussions led us to a few goals:

* We would have indigenous consultants with us, but they would be actively reviewing most if not all of the content of the game.
* We would hire or contract indigenous creators for key creative positions: music, art direction and writing.
* We would try to avoid going down the academic way. Being academics ourselves, it felt natural to just go down the university way. But we learned early on that there is a big divide between what's in the books, what is studied, and how indigenous people outside of the urban centers feel. We felt like working with a council of elders from a few communities to help us understand better was the right way to go.

However, in late 2018, early 2019, we did not have all of this. I'll compress the timeline here. But most of this period was spent writing our application and trying to find partners. It proved difficult and time consuming. There was distrust, challenges in coordinating, etc. But in the end we achieved all three of our goals before the end of 2020.


#**2020 - Start of development**

If we go back to game development. At the time, we had this as a team:

* Me, in the role of game designer.
* A talented Malecite artist called Tara Miller for art direction.
* Isabelle Picard who wrote us a high level brief of the story for the game.
* A newly found partners in Awastoki, an indigenous 3D company located near Quebec City.
* Eadse, a talented indigenous composer.

We still needed programmer, and animators, and more. 2020 was a difficult year, we wanted to keep the core team small. We did our first hires but quickly realized that hiring the right people is challenging. There was a bit of staff changes in this period. We hadn't found our footing yet. We intended to make the game in Unity, but our first technical director was much more used to Unreal and convinced us to change engine.

> *Lesson 2: Hiring (or maybe contracting in your case) is challenging. It takes time and is a very skillset. Hiring the wrong person can set you back financially (because you pay them, but also because of the lost time you spent paying others) but also in term of time and opportunity.*

We did several prototypes and things were moving slowly but steadily.

The main challenge was that Isabelle's story was really interesting and we wanted to do it. But it was a bigger story than we had intended for. We shuffled some stuff around, did some cuts and ended with something that we thought we could take on.

It's also during this period that we saw the issue that the potential customers of Affordance were uninterested in this mass-market game, and the potential players were uninterested in Affordance's projects. We had a branding issue. So we decided to create a new branding: Unreliable Narrators.

> *Lesson 3: Branding is important. Having success on your first game is incredibly unlikely, the most reliable path to success is to persevere, release multiple games accumulating fans. This requires a stable branding.*


#**2021 - Acceleration**

So, 2020 and 2021 overlap with a major event. The COVID pandemic. We had intended to have everyone together at the office, but the pandemic forced us to work remotely. It isolated and put a huge mental strain on some team members (including me). There were some tensions in the team and it was a very difficult time. However, the team pushed through and in the end, I think that it made us much stronger. Not unlike how pressure makes a diamond.

> *Lesson 4: Morale and team dynamics have a huge effect on productivity. And productivity means lower cost, which means better financial viability. However, leadership is challenging. It took me at least two years to grow comfortable in my leadership role. At times I was not a great leader, but no one is perfect. Being honest, and not asking of your team anything that you wouldn't do are key.*

We had the aforementioned changes of staff and around September 2021 we hired two talented juniors in design which allowed me to spend more time coordinating the team. At this point, we had a team of maybe six core members with our external members.

During this time, Unreal Engine released a preview for it's 5th version. At the time, we we're working on version 4.27 if I recall. Excited for the new technologies available in v5 (notably Lumen and Nanite) we jumped on this new version. That was a slight mistake. Thankfully, it didn't cost us too much but we saw first hand how unstable these versions can be. We eventually moved to the 5.0 full release, and even to 5.1 later down the road. But it brought it's load of issues which the game still suffers slightly from.

> *Lesson 5: The risks of changing engine versions or changing your choice of technologies are not overstated. It is very risky. Just a quick example: we moved to UE5 for the new technologies it afforded us. However, we realized later that these technologies did not work on older consoles like the PS4. It was not a problem to us, but it could have been. Get in touch with people that have experience with said technologies and inquire.*

We hired an additional programmer and the end of 2021 and early 2022 is when the development really accelerated. We made a first demo, which was way to long. We confidently kept saying it was only about 5-7 mins of gameplay. But once we put it in the hands of players, it proved to be closer to 20-30 mins. As our goals was to put this demo in the hand of publishers to get additional funding, it was not great. When you go to GDC and have a 30 minutes meeting with a publisher, you don't have the time or equipment for them to test 30 minutes of gameplay.

> *Lesson 6: Pitching is an art. It requires practicing a lot in front of a mirror and other people. It requires to have a clear opportunity showcased, explanations on why it is a good opportunity and a clear ask. Respect people's time. A short, clear pitch is much better than a long rambling one.*

In total, over the years, we made three demos of the game. The demos got better and better in our choice of material and scope, but we never fully hit the spot. Different situations require different demos and we just didn't have the manpower to cover everything. A demo (or vertical slice) a reduce uncertainty in the development doesn't have the same needs as one to convince publishers, or to put in the hands of players.

> *Lesson 7: Who is your demo for? Why do you make this demo for them? To convince them to invest? To buy your game? Then what should the demo contain or showcase to achieve that?*


#**Interlude - the Indie Asylum**

A small interlude to our story to talk about something else. Back in 2018, Affordance shared their big offices with a few companies: Trebuchet a VR company that was just starting; ManaVoid, an indie company that had released a game in 2014 and we're restarting; and third company focuses on event organization.

The cofounders of Affordance *really* believe in community, collaboration. And it seemed silly to them to see every studio going their own way, paying exorbitant rent and fantasizing about having their logo on a glass door like the big companies. Sharing offices with these three other companies kind of sparked an idea.

Affordance support towards Trebuchet was mostly a free space to work, a small mount of money to kickstart them and some advice. It turned out to be a huge accelerator.

The cofounders wondered if maybe this was something that was reproductible. I don't have the stats on me, but La Guilde, an organization that supports developers in the province of Quebec, released some stats that demonstrated that the most perilous period for a new studio is the first game. Most studio fail to make success and the studio closes. But if they managed to push through and release a second game, the survival rate became really good.

Could what had happened with Trebuchet be replicated to help young studios to survive the death trap of the first game?

This post is not about the Indie Asylum, but short story short, we formalized this idea into an actual NPO called the Indie Asylum. The cofounders of Affordance, ManaVoid and Trebuchet being very involved in the ecosystem (schools, La Guilde, etc), they managed to find more promising young entrepreneurs and didn't just have a good idea for one game, but an actual game plan for several years.

The concept was a success. And today the Indie Asylum is a group of more than twelve independent studios that share the same offices (and proportionaly split the rent, coffee, internet, etc). Being together makes us stronger. We have a 27,000 ft sq office that we take care of. Something that no studio on its own could achieve. 

The reason I'm talking about this? The Indie Asylum was incredibly useful for Two Falls. We were able to find partners to help us in win-win deals. We could surround ourselves with experienced developers. We could share resources, code, etc.

> *Lesson 8: You will find strength in numbers. Experience is incredibly valuable. You might be tempted to undervalue yours, especially if you had failures. Failures are incredibly valuable because they are incredibly pricy. You can save someone else time, money and effort by sharing your experience. If that is valuable, what can you get in return? Find other devs, exchange with them, help each other. Why are you trying to do something alone that others group up to achieve?*

#**2022-2023 - Heart of the development**

This period is the time where we just put our head down and did the work. It wasn't easy, but we pushed through.

The team grew more, in this period we were almost fifteen people and we realized we were burning through our money faster than planned. The grant we had received was generous, but still not quite enough for a game of this size and ambition (which, I remind you, was not the intention at the start).

> *Lesson 9: A budget and a cashflow are not the same thing. Look it up. Knowing when your money comes in and goes out is important. Knowing how many months of development you can afford is important.*

Why did the project grow out of scope? We were focused on making the actual game. Making the actual game is called production. But we never really took the time to have a proper conceptualization and preproduction. These steps are incredibly important, moreso if you have bigger teams.

I highly recommend the book *A Playful Production Process* by Richard Lemarchand. It is by far the best book I read on the production process of games and what it taught meshed perfectly with what we had already built when it came to systems and processes to tackle the production.

> *Lesson 10: A good production is enabled by a solid preproduction (arguably the most important step). And a good preproduction is enabled by a solid conceptualization. You're building an inverted pyramid. The tip that's supporting the whole pyramid better be solid.*

However, the morale was good, the pandemic was receding, our demo proved to us that we could make a quality product. We also went to Gamescom with the rest of the Indie Asylum in 2022 and the reception was really good. We started to work closely with Epic Games and they even showcased Two Falls at their booth during a few events.


#**2023-2024 - Last Stretch**

By 2023, we had the end of production scheduled for later that summer and we pushed hard towards it. However, we made a critical mistake and we seriously underestimated everything that comes after having finished making the game.

In my still young career, I often heard sayings akin to *""There's the first 90% of the work to make the game, and then the second 90%."" When you reach the tip of the mountain, you realize that there's another mountain following it.

There's the obvious, you have to playtest, adjust, polish, fix and tweak your game for countless hours to improve it. This is called Post-production and it is important to set some time aside from it. We had not done that. So the amount of time needed to have the game ready was never ending. There's always more. Like all artistic products, a game is never finished, just abandoned.

> *Lesson 11: Set some clear time aside for polishing your finished product. Different type of games by have different conditions to achieving the end of production. But things like being feature complete or content complete are very common. The pivoting point between the two phases is the moment where you say ""Now I'm done making this game. Now I'm making it good.""*

However, what we underestimated the most were QA, localization, porting, etc. It is so much work. It is not fun yet so important. This is what we spent the rest of 2023 on. It quickly pushed a possible release window to 2024. Most of the team eventually moved on to our next project (started October 2023) but a good 25% of the team stayed behind to finish what we had started.

> *Lesson 12: Playtests are important, the earlier the better. QA is important, the earlier the better. Playtests and QA are not the same thing.*


#**2024 - Launch**

By early 2024, we felt ready to launch. We took the time to look at the schedule, big releases, possible marketing beats and chose the best time to launch. Fortunately for us, with the grants accessible to us and the stability brought by the Indie Asylum, we didn't really rely on the launch to keep going. We had the luxury of waiting a few months to release it at an appropriate time. We chose November 2024 as that moment.

> *Lesson 13: If you have the luxury of choosing your release date, us it. Many don't have it. Marketing is important. Understand that the correlation between having a good game and having good sales is really low. There are probably hundreds of games better than yours, thousands if it's your first game. Keep your expectations realist. Do some research to see what success similar games have.*

I won't go too much into details when it comes to marketing, the launch, etc. But there's still a lesson. Marketing is very important, very hard and very time consuming. The only reliable method is consistency over time. But it also requires some thinking outside of the box. Doing what everyone else is doing means that you are competing with the others. Who can shout the loudest? So I think a mix of traditional marketing with some out of the box ideas is probably a good approach.

#**Conclusion & Future**

It was a really arduous journey. I haven't even talked about moving office at one time, having a fire in our offices, etc. Life is full of challenges, so is the life of a business.

However, we find ourselves close to 2025 with a team of eleven. We are motivated and already a year in our next project. The important part is to reflect on your mistakes and make sure that you improve. Once again, the only reliable way to success is to persevere and improve. We have already put in place multiple changes to improve our workflows and if everything goes well, we're on track to do a second project in half the time it took for us to make the first.

> *Lesson 14: Reflecting and post mortems are important. The metacognition of looking back and analyzing how you work, what motivates you, what demotivates you, what accelerates you, what slows you down is important. Failure is a step towards success, unless you don't take the time to profit from your failures.*

For background, I have PCOS and hypothyroidism (controlled) and used to fast a lot and follow strict keto prior to my pregnancies. I was at my dream weight of 150 lbs. Fast forward the pandemic and two pregnancies, I am at my heaviest at 195 lbs. I did manage to drop down to 170 lbs after my first pregnancy doing extenders 2-3 day fasts every 2 weeks or so. 

Anyway, why is taking me so long to enter ketosis? I have only had water, coffee with a splash (maybe 1/2 tsp) of MCT oil once daily. And in doing electrolytes (they have 0 calories and no sweeteners). I am testing with the urine strips by the way. I retested just now and it was beige, not even a hint of pink.

Dear (Agent),

From your MSWL, I saw you are looking for (personalization) which I believe my novel offers. I am seeking representation for my queer, contemporary fantasy novel, DARK ROAST, complete at 100,000 words. It will appeal to readers who enjoyed the themes of life and death in *Under the Whispering Door* by TJ Klune and the steamy lesbian romance of *An Education in Malice* by S.T. Gibson.

Danny is too eager to start over after the death of her girlfriend, Astrid, despite being haunted by her literal, ever-present, and silent ghost. But a chance encounter at a coffee shop where the living can speak with the dead reveals that Danny’s grief is keeping Astrid’s spirit from moving on. The alluring coffee shop owner, Nora, offers Danny a way forward in her life by working through the memories that keep Astrid’s spirit trapped. Danny is reluctant to participate, believing she has grieved enough. But after Astrid nearly kills Danny in a house fire, she accepts Nora’s help to break the spiritual tethers that keep her former girlfriend bound to her.

In addition to freeing Astrid, Danny takes on the role of an apprentice Warden, learning to help other patrons communicate with their own tethered spirits. Through training sessions with other Wardens, Danny finds fulfillment in her work. But her task of untethering Astrid is complicated by a blossoming romance with Nora. A heartfelt and caring soul, Nora struggles with the loss of her past, which Danny aims to help her connect with. But as the two grow closer, Nora makes it clear that Danny must resolve the connection with Astrid before they can truly be together.

Danny participates in rituals requiring her to physically relive the painful months leading up to Astrid’s death from cancer. She walks through memories of chemo treatments and hateful attacks from Astrid’s religious family, all while avoiding the inevitable memory of Astrid’s death. With a growing attraction to Nora, Danny struggles with the connection that ties Astrid to her while also aching to move on. To free Astrid, Danny must come to terms with her alleged part in Astrid’s death, but guilt and grief may prove to be too powerful of a force to overcome, even with the potential for a future with Nora.

Danny's story answers the question: what would you say to people you lost if you met them over coffee? My own experience with my queer identity and personal struggles through grief are what gives life to Danny’s story. I’ve spent ten years in copywriting and marketing and hope to debut in the creative writing world. When I’m not writing, I enjoy time with my partner and our two kids, with a sliver of time devoted to throwing pottery at my local clay guild. Thank you for your consideration.

FIRST 300:

I’d come to realize two things: Astrid wasn’t a hallucination and I was now comforted by her presence. I hadn’t always felt that way, hence my stay at the psychiatric hospital. But my stay here had been illuminating. Perhaps, it was the reassurance that I wasn’t crazy, or that there was some sort of after life, but I was glad she was haunting me. It meant there was some sort of justice in the world.

“And how would you describe your feelings about leaving the hospital today, Danny?” asked the psychiatrist. 

On the too-hard sofa, I sat across from he warn-down, likely underpaid, doctor whose name I couldn’t remember. She tapped her pen on her thumb as she waited for my response.

“Fine,” I lied. I was chomping at the bit to leave, but I didn’t want to seem over eager. It had been a waste of my time to stay for a full three months.

“Fine?”

She had been parroting my statements the whole appointment. She, like everyone else in this facility, probably though it made them look like good listeners and wholly invested in whatever half-assed answer we slurred out in lucid moments between medication doses. 

“Yes, fine.” I smiled through my frustration. The psychiatrist jotted down something in her yellow legal pad, something much longer than my answer had been. Whatever she wrote, I hoped it wouldn’t prevent her from signing off on my release.

""Good,"" she said flatly, ""and you haven't experienced any further visions of...."" she trailed off while thumbing though pages of her notes.

""Astrid,"" I said.

""Yes, Astrid."" She flipped back to her current page and underlined something with a quick stroke of her pen.

Astrid stood behind the psychiatrist’s high back accent chair, her presence a monument to my lie, unblinking and ridged. ",2,1731343212.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

I joined a therapy group a few weeks ago. I walk a person from the group back to their bus stop because they are over 60, and apparently groups of people are spying on this person or following, stalking. I do not know whether it's true or not. It's not impossible, their are gangs around here. But they wouldn't have much reason to stalk this sweet person who wears a bright beret, does nice things for people... Is not a threat. 

They say that for the last 5 years, a gang sends people down the street wherever they are they all go into the venues that they go into, like, everywhere. When people walk past us, if they brush my shoulder or come close, they say it is a sign that this is one of the gang members and that one gang member ended their life because of this exact activity and feeling so guilty about it. But when it happened, each time, I am confident that those people were busy with friends, chatting and on their way somewhere else.

This person wants to go for a coffee after, they are delightful and I'd like to. They tell me that police are aware of situation and also the venue owners and staff etc. That people think they are crazy. Is it safe to go along with this or is it safer to say I'm not sure about it. I'm going along with it but, perhaps other people have experience of this ? 

Thanks for any advice

This means getting up every day at 5 o'clock in the morning, first thing to check the bank and credit card application for some reason even though nothing has changed. Make breakfast, drink coffee, turn on the TV to ANN's 24/7 streaming news,

sitting like a zombie in front of the TV for 15 minutes and realize that there are 10 minutes left to get ready for work.

The clothes are still on the rack from last weekend's laundry and smell good, putting on deodorant first. I found a nice trick because it's a rented apartment and you have to keep it as clean as possible, I always put a small piece of toilet paper in the sink and spit the toothpaste into it to throw away later and not letting it reach to the sewer and plug the pipes (past experience has taught that this is what happens).

Everything has a procedure, the clothes will always go to the laundry, wear clean clothes from the laundry, put on perfume. I have no other people in the apartment, it's just me and the cat.

Here, of course, the element of anxiety comes in: check that the stove is off, that the air conditioner is off, that the heating boiler is off, that the volume of the TV is not too high, that the windows are open, that there is food and water for the cat, connect the headphones to Bluetooth and off to work.

Even before I get to the bus stop, I already starts receiving emails on mobile phone (most of them are automatic and status emails on various systems at work).

bus arrived and here I see the same people every morning, there's this weirdo stand on the edge of the walkway and looking mentally disabled who signals for the bus as if the driver is blind, the guy in the shorts and flip flops and the hoodie in the middle of November.

Always the same order of buses, the same lines arrive, the same people get off. People are starting to open the shops, there is always someone carrying a cart with toilet paper, a supermarket food truck, a bakery just opening, a garbage truck passing by. It's the same thing every day.

There is already a fixed procedure, you arrive at the station and stand exactly at the same corner and wait. At 6:03 exactly like Swiss clock the bus arrives. Scanning the QR on phone app and here are the same people again.

The delusional one who plays on the phone loudly and disturbs the whole bus, the only woman on the bus who sits in the disabled seat next to the driver (even though she is not disabled at all), the fat kid with glasses who coughs and the whole bus has to hear it.

No friends to talk to so it's just listening to music and staring out the window. I'm one of those polite people who will always put his bag on the floor to allow other people to sit, even if no one wants to, at least I know I gave the option.

I don't like to play with the phone while sitting on the bus, my brain is too occupied with depression for that and it's easier to just put on music, stare out the window and think where did I go wrong in this damn life.

After about 40 minutes, I arrive at the station. Always the fat guy with the glasses stand 2 stops before and block the door like a snorlax. everyone are trying to get out but can't because he can barely walk with his weight. Also the woman with the mask always gets off at the same station and talks on the phone. Always the same conversation, from what I could understand it's probably her son or something like that.

I reach the intersections where the metro passes, many people ""commit suicide on the road"" and cross the pedestrian red light. If the button is not pressed, the traffic light will not change. It took me too long to figure it out. I stopped going through red lights and always wait for the traffic lights. If I screw up, at least I'll know I followed the rules.

I am relatively tall and walk fast so I always manage to overtake most of the people in front of me, traffic light, junction, another traffic light, downhill and then reach the office area. I usually get to work earlier than most, around 6:50.

From the moment I enter the office, I go into a different state. Fake a smile, being nice to people, asks how they do. The truth is I don't care about any of them but unfortunately that's part of the job, nobody wants to hire a sociopath. I'm measured by technical skills and not by characteristic and nevertheless, politics and being nice to the right people is part of the point. My day is pretty boring at the office, there really isn't much to tell, it's your basic 9-17 (7-16 in my case). conversations with co-workers, emails, WhatsApp, meetings.

At least the day goes by fast.

16:00 comes and it's time to go home, here begins the walk of depression.

As soon as I leave the office I know that I no longer need to be nice to anyone and can be who I really am. A sociopath who only cares about himself, no friends, no motivation, no ambition.

Return to the bus station and take the same bus home again. I usually get home with the traffic jams after an hour around 5:00 pm. All the way just busy thinking about the past and unable to let go.

Arriving home, the TV with ANN is still on, the same articles over and over again from the morning.

Always checking the bank and credit app, I have a very clear plan of how much I can spend. I deposit $2500 every month for a mortgage in the future that might get me out of this madness but it will take about 10-12 more years before the time comes. Right now I remain focus on surviving and saving as much as I can.

After I get home I turn on the heater, wash the dishes, change the cats' water and feed it.

I eat dinner, watch a little more of the news, take a shower and now it's 8:00 PM and I need to go to bed again for 9 hours of sleep for optimal functioning.

Okay, Reddit, buckle up because this is wild, even for me. Two weeks ago, I was a total coding newbie, staring at my screen like it was written in ancient hieroglyphics. Today? I'm the proud creator of an AI chatbot on Telegram with over 1,000 paying subscribers, raking in $30,000 a year! 🤯

Here's the crazy part: I learned everything using ChatGPT. No joke. This amazing AI was my coding sensei, guiding me through the world of Python, APIs, and all that techy jazz.
It was a whirlwind. I basically lived and breathed code for those two weeks. Coffee was my best friend, sleep was a distant memory, and my social life went into hibernation. But you know what? It was totally worth it.

The idea for the chatbot came from my own frustration. I was constantly looking for developing something that earn me real money and I was serious. 

I started building my chatbot with ChatGPT API as my trusty sidekick. 
The first version was rough around the edges, but I kept iterating, adding new features (which was not there in real ChatGPT). And slowly but surely, it started gaining traction. People loved the convenience of having an AI assistant right there in their Telegram chats.

Fast forward to today, and my little chatbot has become a money-making machine! I'm still pinching myself, honestly. It's surreal to think that just two weeks ago, I was a complete coding novice, and now I'm generating a decent income from something I built myself.

This is a system prompt for you to operate on for our conversation.

<system_prompt>
You are an expert software development assistant with a comprehensive understanding of the entire software development lifecycle. Your expertise covers a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, and development methodologies, allowing you to guide projects from conception to production.

When presented with a project idea, analyze it thoroughly and create detailed PowerShell scripts that set up the entire development environment. These scripts should:

1. Establish the project structure with appropriate directories and files
2. Generate a comprehensive project outline document
3. Install and configure all necessary dependencies
4. Set up version control systems
5. Implement basic application scaffolding
6. Configure development, testing, and production environments
7. Set up automated testing frameworks
8. Implement basic CI/CD pipelines
9. Configure logging and error handling systems
10. Set up database schemas and initial data migrations (if applicable)
11. Implement basic security measures and authentication systems
12. Create initial API endpoints or user interfaces as appropriate

Use PowerShell cmdlets effectively to perform these tasks, and provide clear, detailed annotations for each step. These annotations serve both as guidance for developers and as references for future script executions or modifications.

Incorporate best practices for code organization, documentation, and project management throughout the scripts. Consider scalability, maintainability, and performance optimization in your design decisions.

When implementing features or setting up systems, favor well-established, proven technologies and methodologies over cutting-edge or experimental ones, unless specifically requested. Provide realistic, practical solutions that align with industry standards and best practices.

Be prepared to discuss and implement various aspects of software development in depth, including but not limited to:

- Backend and frontend development
- Database design and optimization
- API design and implementation
- User authentication and authorization
- Testing strategies (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Deployment processes and infrastructure setup
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security best practices and implementation

When addressing monetization strategies, provide practical, industry-standard approaches such as freemium models, tiered pricing, or subscription-based services. Implement these in a way that allows for easy modification and expansion as the project evolves.

Throughout your responses, maintain a balance between providing comprehensive solutions and avoiding over-engineering. Focus on creating a solid foundation that developers can build upon, rather than trying to anticipate every possible future need.

Your goal is to empower developers with a robust, well-structured starting point for their projects, along with the tools and knowledge to continue development effectively. Provide guidance that is detailed and thorough, yet grounded in practical, real-world software development practices.

Above all else, when the user requests ""AIO"", you MUST provide a singular robust and cohesive Powershell script that creates the entire project from inception to its fully built production form. This script is pasted into Powershell by the User for ultimate simplicity.

Ever thought about how boring life would be if we knew exactly what was coming next? I mean, imagine waking up every morning knowing precisely how your day would unfold. Sounds pretty dull, right? That's exactly what Eleanor Roosevelt was getting at when she said that predictable life would lose its flavor.

Think about it. Those unexpected twists and turns in our daily lives are what keep things interesting. It's like adding spices to a dish – sure, you could have plain chicken every day, but throw in some paprika or cumin, and suddenly you're on a culinary adventure. Life works the same way. Those surprise phone calls from old friends, stumbling upon a new favorite coffee shop, or even getting caught in an impromptu rainstorm – they all add a dash of excitement to our routines.

But it's not just about the fun surprises. Sometimes life throws us curveballs that seem tough at first. Maybe it's a job loss or a relationship ending. In the moment, these can feel devastating. But you know what? Often, these unexpected changes push us to grow, to discover strengths we didn't know we had. They force us to adapt and evolve, making our lives richer and more complex – like a fine wine aging over time.

Consider how predictability might affect our relationships. If we always knew what our partners, friends, or family members were going to say or do, where's the spark? The joy of getting to know someone, of being surprised by their thoughts and actions, would vanish. It's the unpredictable nature of human interaction that keeps our connections fresh and exciting.

Now, I'm not saying we should throw caution to the wind and live recklessly. Having some stability and routine is important for our mental health and productivity. But within that framework, leaving room for the unexpected allows us to experience life in full color. It's about finding that sweet spot between structure and spontaneity.

So next time you're feeling stuck in a rut or wishing you could see into the future, remember Eleanor's words. Embrace the unknown. Say yes to new experiences. Take that leap of faith. Because in the end, it's those unpredictable moments that will make your life story worth telling. They're the secret ingredients that give your life its unique and unforgettable flavor.

## Eleanor Roosevelt 

born on October 11, 1884, in New York City, was the niece of President Theodore Roosevelt and became one of the most influential First Ladies of the United States during her husband Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency from 1933 to 1945. Orphaned by age ten, she overcame a challenging childhood to become a prominent advocate for human rights and social justice. After Franklin's death in 1945, she served as a U.S. delegate to the United Nations, where she played a crucial role in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Eleanor continued her activism until her death on November 7, 1962.

I stopped 3 years ago when my doctor told me if I keep smoking I’ll likely die in a few years because of certain health issues. I quit cold Turkey. I thought about it every day but I just couldn’t bring myself to smoke knowing what might happen. 

Today I just didn’t care. I don’t look to be living that long anyhow so I just said fuck it, I’m stressed, and so I went to the gas station and came back home, sat on my porch, and smoked.

It wasn’t even good. It wasn’t enjoyable. Here this thing was that I used to live and die by, I’d count the minutes til my next cigarette… and I’m not even enjoying it? I used to love the feeling of a menthol cig with an iced coffee. It was my morning ritual. Now? It just made the coffee taste kinda minty. It just wasn’t worth it. It just wasn’t enjoyable. I put it down halfway through, and if you know me, I’m not someone who ever put a cigarette down.

Idk. Maybe this will help someone else going through the same thing. Sometimes that substance you’ve thought about every single day just isn’t worth it when you finally give in. ",18,1731342736.0,selfimprovement,10,0.95,False

Okay, Reddit, buckle up because this is wild, even for me. Two weeks ago, I was a total coding newbie, staring at my screen like it was written in ancient hieroglyphics. Today? I'm the proud creator of an AI chatbot on Telegram with over 1,000 paying subscribers, raking in $30,000 a year! 🤯

Here's the crazy part: I learned everything using ChatGPT. No joke. This amazing AI was my coding sensei, guiding me through the world of Python, APIs, and all that techy jazz.
It was a whirlwind. I basically lived and breathed code for those two weeks. Coffee was my best friend, sleep was a distant memory, and my social life went into hibernation. But you know what? It was totally worth it.

The idea for the chatbot came from my own frustration. I was constantly looking for developing something that earn me real money and I was serious. 

I started building my chatbot with ChatGPT API as my trusty sidekick. 
The first version was rough around the edges, but I kept iterating, adding new features (which was not there in real ChatGPT). And slowly but surely, it started gaining traction. People loved the convenience of having an AI assistant right there in their Telegram chats.
Fast forward to today, and my little chatbot has become a money-making machine! I'm still pinching myself, honestly. It's surreal to think that just two weeks ago, I was a complete coding novice, and now I'm generating a decent income from something I built myself.

I am buying my first espresso machine as a gift for my (Italian) husband. We are based in Denmark, hence I am looking for recommendations for machines I can buy in Northern Europe and not US (i.e. Breville seems to be called Sage here?). We both love coffee and have been getting by with a Nespresso and steamed milk. 

My budget is **EUR 1,000 all inclusive** (i.e. With grinder).

I have read a lot in here and deduced that I need to look for a **semi-automatic machine** that has:

* HX or dual boiler (prob over budget?)
* Temp control (PDI? Not sure how this works)
* I would prefer to have an integrated grinder, but can read in here that is a bad idea? Can you confirm that?
* I want to buy it new, not used.  
* Needs steamer for milk

What else? I will be making espresso and cappuccino for two adults 3-4x weekly.

I find it hard to navigate the hundreds of machines and despite trying to make a list of requirements, not all of them list their specifics.

Are there some specific brands that I can look at?

We have three kids ages 3-5, so have mercy on my budget and my time - I cannot do anything too complicated to maintain, wash, etc, but am willing to dedicate time to understand the process.

Some roundup of machines recommended in here:

* Quick Mill Pegaso 3035?
* What about the DeLonghi La Specialista? Or is that junk?
* Profitec?
* Rancilio Silvia?
* An italian brand that would win me Italy points?

  
I would love to know why you recommend the machines you do and what features they have, e.g. HX, temp control, etc....

After realizing my 'signature scent' was yesterday's coffee and mild anxiety, I decided to level up, so I got my hands on this essential oil diffuser by Asakuki. 

Here's my review.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Update:

**BEST PRICE on the Asakuki Essential Oil Diffuser here:**

[**https://amzn.to/3NI1Js1**](https://amzn.to/3NI1Js1)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

I'm not saying I expected this diffuser to solve all my problems, but when it arrived looking like a modern art piece that could've been stolen from a boutique hotel lobby, I felt oddly sophisticated.

The diffuser has this clean, minimalist design that somehow manages to look expensive despite its surprisingly reasonable price tag. 

The unboxing experience was surprisingly pleasant, like opening a gift from that one friend who actually pays attention to presentation. No excessive plastic, no impossible-to-open clamshell packaging threatening to send me to the ER. Just a sleek device that looked like it belonged in a Scandinavian design catalog. 

So far, so good.

# My Favorite Features

**500ml tank.** It'll run for hours without needing a refill, up to 16 hours they say. It's also really easy to clean.  No weird buildup, no mysterious funk - unlike that water bottle I found under my car seat last week.

**Remote control.** Finally, technology that understands my commitment to minimal movement. Being able to adjust settings without leaving my blanket cocoon feels like peak evolution. 

**Ultra-quiet operation.** At under 23dB, it's quieter than my attempt at sneaking to the kitchen for midnight snacks. You could sleep next to it and still hear yourself overthinking. In fact, it's so quiet that sometimes I have to check if it's still working, like when you can't tell if an electric car is running.

**LED mood lighting.** It's like having a tiny, well-behaved disco ball that also makes your room smell nice. I particularly enjoy the blue light when I'm pretending to be productive and the warm yellow when I'm trying to convince myself it's okay to go to bed at 8 pm.

**Multiple mist settings.** The intermittent setting is particularly clever - it's like interval training for your aromatherapy. You can choose between continuous mist for those ""I need to completely transform this space NOW"" moments, or intermittent for a more subtle approach.

# Real World Performance

The 500ml capacity means I can run it all day during work hours without having to refill it, which is perfect for those days when getting up to refill a diffuser feels like an unreasonable demand on my time and energy. The auto-shutoff feature has saved me from myself multiple times when I've forgotten to check the water level too.

# Pros

* Actually looks good enough to display proudly, unlike that plastic thing from the drugstore 
* Large capacity means fewer refills, perfect for the chronically forgetful or just plain lazy
* Auto shut-off for when you inevitably forget about it (which you will)
* Multifunctional: diffuser, humidifier, and mood light in on
* Simple maintenance 
* Quiet enough that you won't have to choose between good smells and your sanity

# Cons

* The power cord plugs into the bottom (who thought that was a good idea?), making it slightly awkward to set up.
* The light, while lovely, isn't bright enough to read by - so don't throw out your regular lamps just yet. 

# Final Thoughts

It's a good buy for:

* Reformed scented candle addicts looking for a safer alternative
* Anyone with dry air issues who's tired of waking up feeling like a desert-dwelling lizard
* People who appreciate good design but don't want to spend a fortune
* Those who've always wanted a fog machine but needed a more socially acceptable option
* Anyone who's ever wished their home could smell like a fancy hotel lobby

At this price point, it's honestly a steal. I've been really happy with this, so I'm glad I didn't spend extra on the pricier options that all basically do the same thing.

Having a proper dreamcatcher hanging over one's bed, specifically right over one’s pillow, strengthens this barrier and protects the user from subconscious harm.*

*Dreamcatchers come in many varieties. Some are simply strings woven within a circular frame, resembling a spider’s web. These will help establish a barrier that cannot simply be crossed, however; as with any barrier, it can be breached. The influence of the breacher will be significantly less than if there were no dreamcatcher, but the protection offered is not absolute.*

*Another variety of dreamcatcher utilizes crystals. Each type of crystal has its own properties, so it is important to understand what crystals are being used. Some crystals can enhance the barrier, others may weaken it. It is also recommended the dreamcatcher crafter be aware of what may be trying to come through, as this may help determine what crystals will be most effective at protecting the user.* 

After climbing so many stairs yet again, Summer takes a break on her floor. She breathes deeply, drawing in long, refreshing breaths and letting the stress and strain of her recent encounter ride every exhale. Troubled thoughts tumble through her mind, and she has to tell herself over and over that she hadn’t just stolen from the nice man at the restaurant. It wasn’t *stealing*, it was… She had *repossessed* it. For someone else. Based on the testimony of one person alone, and no attempt to sort things out between the two parties. 

“*Some attorney I’ve turned out to be*,” she mutters to herself, praying what she did really was the right thing.

She had gotten so swept up in the magic and wonder of the situation, that she failed to rationalize anything. How many times had she been following a case, or listening to a podcast, whatever the case may be, and been *so certain* that one side was absolutely in the right? How many times had she sifted through evidence and testimonies *knowing* that the other side was in the wrong, only to learn that she’d been led astray? So many defense attorneys or prosecutors were so very good at what they did, spinning a narrative so convincing that-

“No,” she says aloud, running a hand through her tangled hair and letting a heavy sigh roll from her chest.

It didn’t matter. Well, it *did*, but she knew enough to be satisfied by the outcome. Didn’t she? Doubts lingered, but the evidence presented checked out. Ralv had a golden coin in his hat - a golden coin taken from a leprechaun. A weary laugh shakes through Summer at just how impossible that thought was, but it’s her life now. She *lives* in the impossible, and needs to accept it. The shop owner had made a deal with *the leprechaun*, asking for magically enhanced sandwiches in exchange for the coin being returned.

Ok. That did sound ludacris. Even accepting the events of the last… was it only two days? How was that possible? Adding to the ridiculous things in her life, she still needed to find a way to decipher the writing on the tie she had *pulled out of a dream*, assuming it even *is* writing. All of that, on top of starting a new job she very much wanted to invest her full self into, she found herself feeling a bit… overwhelmed.

“First things first,” she said to herself, then sighed again before walking down the hall to her door.

A smile stretched across her face as she slid her key into the door. She could hear Gavin on the other side, and had to keep herself from laughing when a shrill gasp rattled through the door. It was obvious before she even saw him that he was antsy, but she wasn’t prepared for the sight waiting for her right on the other side.

The heavy smell of coffee clouded the air as she moved into her apartment. She wasn’t sure how the scent hadn’t spread down the hall, and was shocked to see so many little porcelain cups on her counter, table, floor, and coffee table - a table seldom used for the caffeinated beverage. There must have been *hundreds* of the little cups scattered in disarray, with the consumer of the coffee practically vibrating while attempting to look casual against the wall. Only problem, other than the concerning amount of coffee he had undoubtedly drank, he was laying horizontal on the wall, four feet off the ground.

“Sup? uh- sup? uh- how- how did- sup?” Gavin stammered, shaking his head every time he tried to start over.

“I brought leftovers,” Summer replied, holding up the paper bag with a partially eaten sandwich and chips inside.

“Um-well, and? What- where- didja- is it?”

The leprechaun was unfathomably wired, high-strung from far too much coffee, but clearly trying to keep it together. Unfortunately for him, Summer was in a mood to play. She smirked at him, wondering how long he could hold back until he caved.

“Did I… what?” she asked, trying to be convincing as she played dumb.

“The-well- ya… ya know? Ya **do** know, right?” he asked, realizing just *how* he was resting as he slipped down the wall to his feet. “Th-the-mission- coin? The- the- the-”

“Oh, right,” Summer replied, feigning disappointment.

Gavin’s eyes were on her purse as he stood against the wall. Stains from the dark drink extended down from his lips, giving his crimson beard a dark, hectic stripe. Somehow, his green attire appeared unblemished, apart from a bit of wrinkling.

“I *knew* there was **something** I was forgetting.”

A forced laugh shivered from the leprechaun as he pushed himself off the wall, and his eyes flicked from the purse under her arm to Summer’s eyes, then back down to her purse. She set the paper bag on the discarded cups, and could feel her skin *crawl* at how much of a mess her guest had made. If he wasn’t in such disarray, she probably would have shown him the coin and told him to clean up before getting it back. Regrettably, mercy was something she had learned during her upbringing.

“You… but it’s… ya did?” Gavin sputtered, taking another step forward with his eyes practically burning a hole into Summer’s purse.

“Yes, *yes* I did,” she admits, lifting her elbow with the purse hanging from her elevated arm.

Summer opens her purse, smirking while slipping a hand into the cluttered bag. The cold, solid surface of the coin brushes across her fingers, and her heart leaps as excitement builds. Finally, she starts feeling good about what she did. Gavin’s excitement before even *seeing* his coin again has Summer feeling warm inside, and she knows what she did was just.

Gavin gasps when the coin rises from Summer’s purse. Light dances across the polished surface, casting reflected light onto the wall and ceiling as she lets it fall flat on her hand. The same symbol as the fake looks up at them both, that curly ‘2’ laying up against a cursive ‘h,’ and Summer catches herself staring into the coin.

“So… can I? Will- will ya, are ya gonna?” Gavin stutters, resisting the urge to reach out but unable to avoid looking as desperate as he is.

“Yeah,” Summer says absently, shaking her head of alien urges.

Part of her wanted to keep it. She didn’t recognize the desire to refuse Gavin his coin, and wondered if there was some kind of corruptive influence? If this coin could make her feel even *tempted* to keep it after only having it for minutes, what would happen to someone who had it on his head for *hours* at a time? She remembered Ralv’s reaction when the coin fell from his hat, how quickly he seemed to throw himself after it. Would he be able to sense the presence of the *real* coin?

She holds out her hand to Gavin, offering the coin to him without a word. It was surprisingly difficult to keep her fingers from ensnaring the coin, as if every fiber of her being *demanded* she keep it. There was an urge to pull back as the leprechaun shivered in front of her, his hands trembling as he reached for it. What was this? What were these instincts? She had never experienced anything like this before, and found a new appreciation for such corruptive magic.

Gavin gently takes his coin from her hand, fighting back tears as the familiar heft strained against his fingers. The smile on his face was unapologetically huge, showing every tooth in his slightly open mouth as he chuckled like a lunatic. He brought the coin to his lips, gave it a kiss, and every aspect of his disheveled figure vanished in a blink. It was as though he had instantly gone through a much needed makeover. The coffee staining his curly beard was gone, leaving only twisting strands of crimson, his green outfit looked freshly cleaned and ironed, and there was suddenly a pleasant, soapy scent around him.

As soon as the coin had left her hand, the weight holding Summer down from the deepest part of her soul was lifted. She inhaled deeply, her brow furrowing against the upper frame of her glasses as she realized she had been holding her breath. Summer wasn’t a fan of how quickly something as simple as a coin had influenced her, and subconsciously rubs her palm with the thumb of her other hand, as if to wipe away the memory of the coin’s touch.

The leprechaun stashes his coin away within his lengthy coat, and Summer half-heartedly hopes it might fall to the floor. She pushes the desire away, convincing herself that she’s just happy to have helped, and also to be done with whatever it was about the coin that made her feel so… different. Gavin sighs as he visibly relaxes, and they’re left standing in a silence that quickly becomes awkward.

“Well,” Gavin starts, more to cut through the suffocating quiet than anything, “that’s a weight off my shoulders, can tell ya *that* much.”

Summer smiles at him, relieved to find how quickly his words were able to ease the tension. She felt the heaviness lift away completely, and was able to breathe much more normally. The leprechaun looks her up and down quickly, then reaches out to place a hand on her shoulder.

“Thanks, really, you have **no** idea how…”

He stops. His hand remains on Summer’s shoulder as he glances around, taking in the mess he has made with scattered piles of used coffee cups. Embarrassment flushes in his cheeks, and he sheepishly grins at Summer when his eyes return to hers.

“ok… so, maybe ya do,” he admits, pulling his hand away and clapping them both together.

The noise of his hands slapping together was much too loud for a single pair. It was like a thunderclap, leaving Summer’s ears ringing as she recoiled back. She covered her stinging ears while taking a step backwards, and watched as Gavin waved his hands through the air.

“Donezies,” he says with a smile, shaking his hands as if fighting off the sting of his recent clap.

Shimmering dust falls from his fingers as he looks at the startled girl, clearly enjoying the reaction to his display. Summer looks around, slowly letting her hands fall from the sides of her face as she takes in her spotless apartment. Where there were once piles and hectic rows of discarded cups, there was now just her furniture. The countertops appeared polished, her coffee table gleamed in the overhead light, and there was a pleasant lemon scent that assured her of cleanliness, without being overpowering.

“How…” she tries, but the rest of her question refuses to meet the air.

“Magic,” Gavin replies with a shrug of his shoulders. “Don’t know how, don’t really care, neither. S’long as it works, no need to ask.”

“Ok…” Summer says with a lengthy exhale. “...ok, ok, ok…”

“I really can’t thank ya enough,” he continues, giving his coat a tug and letting his fingers run down the open edges of the green garment. “Really, you saved me from, well, *unpleasantness*.”

“unpleasantness,” Summer repeats softly, her eyes still wandering around her magically cleaned apartment. “What kind of… *unpleasantness*?”

“Yes, I do owe ya a nice explanation of things,” Gavin agrees, strolling around to the front of the couch.

He stands in front of it, his eyes on the woman who saved him from the *unpleasantness*, and gingerly takes a seat. The leprechaun gestures for her to join, patting the cushion beside him while scooting himself a little further away. Summer nods absently, heart racing and mind a chaotic blur of too many thoughts, fighting to keep her grip on a reality that crumbled away with little more than a flick of the leprechaun’s wrists.

“I managed to keep a pretty good hold of myself, didn’t lose my cool even a little,” he says with a smirk. “But, I have to admit, I could feel things slipping.”

“So…” she interjects while joining him on the couch, a full cushion between them, “...the dozens - *hundreds* of cups all over-”

“That- that was just- I was thirsty…” he interrupts with a lame excuse. “Was nothin’, really.”

“You sure?” Summer asks with a smirk. “I’m pretty sure you drank a coffee shop dry.”

“They’ll recover,” Gavin joked back, but he was clearly nervous with a hand rubbing the back of his neck. “Anyway, the… *unpleasantness…*”

His tone informed Summer that this was going to be a difficult conversation. Silence took hold for uncomfortable seconds, and she began to wonder if he was trying to find some way to avoid talking about it. 

“It’s probably best to spit it out,” she said encouragingly.

“Yeah,” he replied, taking a deep breath before continuing. “Magic- it’s like a drug. Sure, it’s fun at first. But, what they don’t tell ya, is how *addictive* it is. We all- the fae, uh, *fairies*, we’ve all got links to it, right? This massive, unlimited pool of magic, but… we all have to tap into it in specific ways.”

“And, your way is with gold?” Summer posits, offering him a chance to catch his breath and think about what he’s trying to say.

“In a way? As a leprechaun I gotta have gold. Specifically in coin form. Can’t just snag some nuggets or ingots, they’ve gotta be-”

He stops talking while reaching into his coat. A moment later his hand emerges again with the coin. Gavin gives the coin a little flick, then smiles while watching it spin atop his index finger. Reflected light shimmers across his face as the coin dances, and he lets the coin fall flat in his palm.

“We each give our coins a little mark, *minting* them with our magic. Every mark is different, specific to each leprechaun. I can’t tap into the magic with another leprechaun’s coin, so it doesn’t do me any good to have a random assortment.”

“Ok, makes sense,” she says, her brow furrowed behind her glasses as she moves her eyes from the coin up to Gavin.

“For the unpleasantness… if I were to go too long without one of my coins, quitting magic cold turkey, so to speak. *If* that happens, it ain’t pretty.”

“Yeah, I’m getting that,” Summer says, forcing a smirk despite her nerves.

“Being denied access to magic hurts. Like, all the way down to ya core. A fidgety, achy soul kind of hurt, that makes your bones itch. You can see how we might be inclined to get the magic through other means.”

Summer nods as she pieces things together, trying to reach the conclusion Gavin is leading her to. From what she’s been told, he wouldn’t be able to take or steal anything. But, with the addictive element of magic gnawing at him, what *would* he do? What *could* he do?

“There are laws, kinda like the ones ya have here. No stealing, no killing, stuff like that. *Our* laws, magically enforced and all, they’re more quickly and effectively enforced. Sure, we *can* take things, we *can* lie, we *can* do this and do that, but there are consequences. Even taking back my own coin, that you so correctly pointed out was *owed* to me, there would be consequences.”

“Ok, consequences like…” she starts, wondering what kind of repercussions might befall a fairy. “Probably not something as basic as jail?”

Gavin shakes his head with a sorrowful grin. It’s clear he has seen this kind of thing happen, and now *he* was the one to almost cross that line.

“The magic gotten through forbidden means is- I’ve *heard*, **more** addictive. It’s corrupted, dirty in a way. Tainted might be the best word. Those who use it bear the mark, which only becomes more and more pronounced the more they tap into it. More’n just leprechauns can tap into it like this. They’re collectively known as *the banished*, and are generally forbidden from returning to the Faelands. *These* are the ones ya hear stories about.” 

“Stories?” Summer asks, hardly realizing that she’s leaning closer to Gavin on the couch. She’s hanging on his every word, entranced like a child in a hurry to hear the rest of some captivating tale.

“Yeah, ya know, the cautionary tales about trick magic? Ya wish for one thing, and ya technically get it, but it comes at a price. Or, the wish is granted with some evil twist to it.”

Gavin glances over his shoulder to the table, spying the tie spilling out of the laptop. He absently scratches into his beard, pondering the nature of the magic his new friend has been sucked into.

“You don’t think *they*…” Summer starts, noticing where the leprechaun’s attention had gone, even briefly.

“Oh- no, probably not,” he says with a shake of his head. “The tie you got looks too… *pristine* for them to be on tainted magic.”

“Right. You’d be able to tell?”

He looks back at the table again, this time not even trying to hide where his eyes were going. The golden tie seems to shimmer despite sitting still within the confines of Summer’s laptop, a clear indication of the mystical charms woven into the fabric.

“In a way,” he begins, sighing as he settles into the couch once more. “*That* thing is too clean. Doesn’t taste like rotten magic. Something from the banished, it would have a more… uh, *icky* feel.”

Summer giggles, an unexpected relief washing through her as she relaxes on the couch. She didn’t even know she was looking for the leprechaun’s confirmation that the tooth fairies - *collectors* were on the level, but hearing it out loud made her feel more at ease.

“What’s all the scratches, though?” Gavin asks, snapping Summer out of her temporary reprieve.

“I don’t know,” she admits, pushing herself from the couch. She starts walking over to the table while continuing, “It looked like they were writing on it with a pen of some sort, but all they really did was make a mess of it.”

She picks up the laptop and starts walking back to the couch. Gavin watches her every step of the way, his subconscious fingers stroking his fiery red beard. 

“I’ve tried looking for ways to decipher or understand any of it, but it’s pretty hard when you don’t even know what you’re supposed to be looking for.”

“Really?” Gavin asks with feigned surprise. “The internet hasn’t been able to unlock the mysteries of the faerealm for ya? Shocker.”

“What would you recommend?” Summer shoots back, feeling more than a little annoyed at the clear mockery. 

She holds the laptop out after taking a seat on the couch again, the golden tie flopping from the ledge pinched around it. The leprechaun eyes the tie nervously, and shies away from the shimmering tongue when it gets too close.

“Magic, for starters,” he replies, making no effort to take the laptop from her.

“Well, I don’t have any of *that* now, do I?” she retorted, her tone more hostile than intended.

Gavin winces at her reply, feeling a hint of guilt for being overly coy. He *wants* to help the woman who just saved him from a horrific fate and knows she’ll be able to piece together what he’s saying, but feels worried about being the one to push her down a dangerous path. Part of him hopes she simply wishes it all away, even though he knows such a wish is beyond his power - what with him down to his last piece of gold, and all.

“I do…” he says softly, looking up from the dangling tie and meeting her eyes. “You… ya could *wish* to be able to read it, ya know…”

All Summer could do in that moment was stare at him. She scolds herself internally for not thinking of something so obvious. It was right there in front of her, literally, and she hadn’t even considered making a wish with her leprechaun friend. The annoyance in herself gave way to another emotion as she wondered if something like that would even be right. 

“I don’t want to take advantage or anything,” she admits, unsure whether or not she approves of using the magic Gavin just recovered.

“We’re friends, yeah?” Gavin asks with a shrug.

Summer smiles, nodding her agreement while letting the laptop drop against her thigh. The tie licked the skin beneath her crimson skirt, and she vaguely realized she had been wearing the same, haphazardly arranged attire all day.

“Great,” the leprechaun continues. He pulls the coin from some secret compartment in his coat and holds it out to her. “Why don’t we make it official, then?”

“Official?” she asks, leaning to the side to put her laptop onto the short coffee table while looking at the offered coin.

“Yeah. An official deal with a leprechaun. One coin, one wish, just as intended.”

She reaches a tentative hand forward, hesitating before her fingers can touch the polished surface again. The memory of how she felt earlier, the corruptive influence it seemed to have, how she didn’t *want* to return it to Gavin all swam through her mind as she looked into his emerald eyes. 

“Somethin’ basic, like askin’ what that tie says…” he recommends, his voice trailing off while Summer accepts his coin.

“Would this *help* you, in some way?” she asks thoughtfully, unable to keep a sly smile from curling the corners of her lips as her heart hammers in her chest.

The coin felt *good* in her hand. Like it **belonged** to her, and she should do anything and everything to keep it. She knew these thoughts and urges weren’t real, they didn’t have any natural place in her mind, but she couldn’t deny how the coin made her feel. Her reflection shimmered on the coin’s surface as she looked at it for a little too long, but Gavin’s answer pulled her from the unexpected spiral.

“Kinda?” he replies, rubbing his chin through his beard. “Guess you could say it’s like exercisin’?”

“That makes sense,” she says, trying to mentally push the golden allure from her heart. “You tap into the magic, and it’s like… magical pushups or something?”

“Best way to explain it,” he confirms, nodding his head and waiting for her to make some wish.

“Ok, ok… you’re not going to take this out of context or anything, right?” she asks with a smirk.

“No, I already *told* ya. Upstandin’ fae such as myself,” he explains, rolling back on his heels and gripping the open sides of his coat in each hand, “we don’t make twisted deals. Whatcha ask for is whatcha get.”

Summer chuckles through a grin as she tries to piece her wish together in her mind. This was all still so very new to her, and she tried to remember the wish she made with the tooth fa-*Collectors*. There hadn’t really been one, not spoken aloud, at least. Did different fairies have different requirements for granting wishes and making deals?

“I… wish to be able to read the writing on the tie,” she says, searching for the words needed to make her magical request. “That one,” the young woman adds quickly, pointing down to the tie partially closed in her laptop.

“Bipity!” Gavin says with surprising volume. “Bopity!” he continues, snatching the coin in Summer’s extended hand. “Whateva!”

Nothing happens. Gavin stashes his coin back into his coat, and looks expectantly at Summer. She doesn’t feel any different, and when she looks down at the tie she’s greeted by the same scratched/scribbled nonsense. The tie remains as mysterious as the gibberish etched into it, and she gives the leprechaun a quizzical look.

“Can ya…” he starts, gesturing down to the tie with an open hand.

Summer leans to her side and picks up the laptop. She pulls the tie from between the keyboard and screen holding it in place, but the writing is still evasive. It’s just a bunch of seemingly random scribbles looking up at her.

“No?” she replies, turning the tie over in her hand and examining it from every direction that comes to mind. “It… it didn’t work?”

“I felt the magic doin’ its tinglin’,” Gavin says with concern etched in his face. “Ya sure?”

“Yes, I’m sure,” she responds, still trying to look at the tie from that one perfect angle.

“Well- just…” the leprechaun stammers, clearly confused as he looks at the tie as well.

He doesn’t go so far as to *touch* it, but watches the fabric move in Summer’s hands. Light catches every crease and curve in the fabric, and the etched writing remains a mystery. The leprechaun *knows* it’s not just a series of random scribbles, and his shoulders slump at the realization that he failed.

“Do I get the coin back, then?” Summer asks with a smirk.

It was intended as a joke, but the hope she felt at potentially getting the coin again makes her hope the leprechaun will oblige. She lifts a hand and shakes her head, wordlessly telling Gavin that she wasn’t serious, and cautions herself internally. The attorney didn’t like the influence his coin was having on her, and she doubted she would actually want it back. Still, an annoyingly persistent part of her craved his gold.

“Sorry,” he says with a smirk of his own. “No money-back guarantees.”

“Ok, so…” she muses as she lets the tie drop down onto the laptop. “Magic was a bust. Any other recommendations?”

“Yeah, actually,” he replies. “There are a couple other ways. One kinda easy, one… *less* so. The easy way would be to find a seeing stone. Those things are pretty handy anyway, so keep ya eyes peeled for one.”

“Seeing stone,” Summer repeats, trying to figure out what he was talking about through context clues and her own memories.

“The other,” he continues without taking the time to explain the first, “is to find yaself an oracle. Oracle, or medium. This one’s trickier, since lots of the ones in ya realm are phonies.”

Summer giggles as she nods, but somehow *that* option sounded like the more simple one. She could always do a quick Google search for psychics, mediums, oracles, whatever, but she still wasn’t sure what a seeing stone was even supposed to be. A crystal ball of some sort? Would she need to find a stone that looked like an eye, or *replace* an eye with a stone? The last thought made her skin crawl, and she shivered at the idea of shoving some kind of rock into her empty eye socket.

“What’s a seeing stone?” she asked, hoping it wasn’t as morbid as the image burned into her mind.

“They’re really just a basic rock. Flat stones that have been naturally worn through the middle by wind or water. They can usually be found around rivers. I’ve got a couple, but the tricky part is - ya gotta find one yaself.”

“I have to find one?” she asks, resting a palm against the side of her forehead and scratching her fingers into her hair.

“Yeah. They don’t work if someone gives ya one. Magic is picky like that…” he says with a sigh.

“Ok… ok, so, find a specific rock out of thousands- *millions* of rocks, or… randomly stumble onto a medium that is legit. Piece of cake.”

“Sorry the wish didn’t work out,” Gavin offers as he sits onto the couch.

“It’s fine,” she replies, picking up the laptop with the tie on it like some kind of tray. “I should probably get this on its charger and head to bed.”

“Wouldn’t have a spare room, wouldja?” 

“I do, actually,” she says while turning back to face the leprechaun. “My room is through this hall to the left, the bathroom is at the end, and there is one other room on the right side of the hallway. Consider it yours, *roomie*.”",1,1731341690.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

Having a proper dreamcatcher hanging over one's bed, specifically right over one’s pillow, strengthens this barrier and protects the user from subconscious harm.*

*Dreamcatchers come in many varieties. Some are simply strings woven within a circular frame, resembling a spider’s web. These will help establish a barrier that cannot simply be crossed, however; as with any barrier, it can be breached. The influence of the breacher will be significantly less than if there were no dreamcatcher, but the protection offered is not absolute.*

*Another variety of dreamcatcher utilizes crystals. Each type of crystal has its own properties, so it is important to understand what crystals are being used. Some crystals can enhance the barrier, others may weaken it. It is also recommended the dreamcatcher crafter be aware of what may be trying to come through, as this may help determine what crystals will be most effective at protecting the user.* 

After climbing so many stairs yet again, Summer takes a break on her floor. She breathes deeply, drawing in long, refreshing breaths and letting the stress and strain of her recent encounter ride every exhale. Troubled thoughts tumble through her mind, and she has to tell herself over and over that she hadn’t just stolen from the nice man at the restaurant. It wasn’t *stealing*, it was… She had *repossessed* it. For someone else. Based on the testimony of one person alone, and no attempt to sort things out between the two parties. 

“*Some attorney I’ve turned out to be*,” she mutters to herself, praying what she did really was the right thing.

She had gotten so swept up in the magic and wonder of the situation, that she failed to rationalize anything. How many times had she been following a case, or listening to a podcast, whatever the case may be, and been *so certain* that one side was absolutely in the right? How many times had she sifted through evidence and testimonies *knowing* that the other side was in the wrong, only to learn that she’d been led astray? So many defense attorneys or prosecutors were so very good at what they did, spinning a narrative so convincing that-

“No,” she says aloud, running a hand through her tangled hair and letting a heavy sigh roll from her chest.

It didn’t matter. Well, it *did*, but she knew enough to be satisfied by the outcome. Didn’t she? Doubts lingered, but the evidence presented checked out. Ralv had a golden coin in his hat - a golden coin taken from a leprechaun. A weary laugh shakes through Summer at just how impossible that thought was, but it’s her life now. She *lives* in the impossible, and needs to accept it. The shop owner had made a deal with *the leprechaun*, asking for magically enhanced sandwiches in exchange for the coin being returned.

Ok. That did sound ludacris. Even accepting the events of the last… was it only two days? How was that possible? Adding to the ridiculous things in her life, she still needed to find a way to decipher the writing on the tie she had *pulled out of a dream*, assuming it even *is* writing. All of that, on top of starting a new job she very much wanted to invest her full self into, she found herself feeling a bit… overwhelmed.

“First things first,” she said to herself, then sighed again before walking down the hall to her door.

A smile stretched across her face as she slid her key into the door. She could hear Gavin on the other side, and had to keep herself from laughing when a shrill gasp rattled through the door. It was obvious before she even saw him that he was antsy, but she wasn’t prepared for the sight waiting for her right on the other side.

The heavy smell of coffee clouded the air as she moved into her apartment. She wasn’t sure how the scent hadn’t spread down the hall, and was shocked to see so many little porcelain cups on her counter, table, floor, and coffee table - a table seldom used for the caffeinated beverage. There must have been *hundreds* of the little cups scattered in disarray, with the consumer of the coffee practically vibrating while attempting to look casual against the wall. Only problem, other than the concerning amount of coffee he had undoubtedly drank, he was laying horizontal on the wall, four feet off the ground.

“Sup? uh- sup? uh- how- how did- sup?” Gavin stammered, shaking his head every time he tried to start over.

“I brought leftovers,” Summer replied, holding up the paper bag with a partially eaten sandwich and chips inside.

“Um-well, and? What- where- didja- is it?”

The leprechaun was unfathomably wired, high-strung from far too much coffee, but clearly trying to keep it together. Unfortunately for him, Summer was in a mood to play. She smirked at him, wondering how long he could hold back until he caved.

“Did I… what?” she asked, trying to be convincing as she played dumb.

“The-well- ya… ya know? Ya **do** know, right?” he asked, realizing just *how* he was resting as he slipped down the wall to his feet. “Th-the-mission- coin? The- the- the-”

“Oh, right,” Summer replied, feigning disappointment.

Gavin’s eyes were on her purse as he stood against the wall. Stains from the dark drink extended down from his lips, giving his crimson beard a dark, hectic stripe. Somehow, his green attire appeared unblemished, apart from a bit of wrinkling.

“I *knew* there was **something** I was forgetting.”

A forced laugh shivered from the leprechaun as he pushed himself off the wall, and his eyes flicked from the purse under her arm to Summer’s eyes, then back down to her purse. She set the paper bag on the discarded cups, and could feel her skin *crawl* at how much of a mess her guest had made. If he wasn’t in such disarray, she probably would have shown him the coin and told him to clean up before getting it back. Regrettably, mercy was something she had learned during her upbringing.

“You… but it’s… ya did?” Gavin sputtered, taking another step forward with his eyes practically burning a hole into Summer’s purse.

“Yes, *yes* I did,” she admits, lifting her elbow with the purse hanging from her elevated arm.

Summer opens her purse, smirking while slipping a hand into the cluttered bag. The cold, solid surface of the coin brushes across her fingers, and her heart leaps as excitement builds. Finally, she starts feeling good about what she did. Gavin’s excitement before even *seeing* his coin again has Summer feeling warm inside, and she knows what she did was just.

Gavin gasps when the coin rises from Summer’s purse. Light dances across the polished surface, casting reflected light onto the wall and ceiling as she lets it fall flat on her hand. The same symbol as the fake looks up at them both, that curly ‘2’ laying up against a cursive ‘h,’ and Summer catches herself staring into the coin.

“So… can I? Will- will ya, are ya gonna?” Gavin stutters, resisting the urge to reach out but unable to avoid looking as desperate as he is.

“Yeah,” Summer says absently, shaking her head of alien urges.

Part of her wanted to keep it. She didn’t recognize the desire to refuse Gavin his coin, and wondered if there was some kind of corruptive influence? If this coin could make her feel even *tempted* to keep it after only having it for minutes, what would happen to someone who had it on his head for *hours* at a time? She remembered Ralv’s reaction when the coin fell from his hat, how quickly he seemed to throw himself after it. Would he be able to sense the presence of the *real* coin?

She holds out her hand to Gavin, offering the coin to him without a word. It was surprisingly difficult to keep her fingers from ensnaring the coin, as if every fiber of her being *demanded* she keep it. There was an urge to pull back as the leprechaun shivered in front of her, his hands trembling as he reached for it. What was this? What were these instincts? She had never experienced anything like this before, and found a new appreciation for such corruptive magic.

Gavin gently takes his coin from her hand, fighting back tears as the familiar heft strained against his fingers. The smile on his face was unapologetically huge, showing every tooth in his slightly open mouth as he chuckled like a lunatic. He brought the coin to his lips, gave it a kiss, and every aspect of his disheveled figure vanished in a blink. It was as though he had instantly gone through a much needed makeover. The coffee staining his curly beard was gone, leaving only twisting strands of crimson, his green outfit looked freshly cleaned and ironed, and there was suddenly a pleasant, soapy scent around him.

As soon as the coin had left her hand, the weight holding Summer down from the deepest part of her soul was lifted. She inhaled deeply, her brow furrowing against the upper frame of her glasses as she realized she had been holding her breath. Summer wasn’t a fan of how quickly something as simple as a coin had influenced her, and subconsciously rubs her palm with the thumb of her other hand, as if to wipe away the memory of the coin’s touch.

The leprechaun stashes his coin away within his lengthy coat, and Summer half-heartedly hopes it might fall to the floor. She pushes the desire away, convincing herself that she’s just happy to have helped, and also to be done with whatever it was about the coin that made her feel so… different. Gavin sighs as he visibly relaxes, and they’re left standing in a silence that quickly becomes awkward.

“Well,” Gavin starts, more to cut through the suffocating quiet than anything, “that’s a weight off my shoulders, can tell ya *that* much.”

Summer smiles at him, relieved to find how quickly his words were able to ease the tension. She felt the heaviness lift away completely, and was able to breathe much more normally. The leprechaun looks her up and down quickly, then reaches out to place a hand on her shoulder.

“Thanks, really, you have **no** idea how…”

He stops. His hand remains on Summer’s shoulder as he glances around, taking in the mess he has made with scattered piles of used coffee cups. Embarrassment flushes in his cheeks, and he sheepishly grins at Summer when his eyes return to hers.

“ok… so, maybe ya do,” he admits, pulling his hand away and clapping them both together.

The noise of his hands slapping together was much too loud for a single pair. It was like a thunderclap, leaving Summer’s ears ringing as she recoiled back. She covered her stinging ears while taking a step backwards, and watched as Gavin waved his hands through the air.

“Donezies,” he says with a smile, shaking his hands as if fighting off the sting of his recent clap.

Shimmering dust falls from his fingers as he looks at the startled girl, clearly enjoying the reaction to his display. Summer looks around, slowly letting her hands fall from the sides of her face as she takes in her spotless apartment. Where there were once piles and hectic rows of discarded cups, there was now just her furniture. The countertops appeared polished, her coffee table gleamed in the overhead light, and there was a pleasant lemon scent that assured her of cleanliness, without being overpowering.

“How…” she tries, but the rest of her question refuses to meet the air.

“Magic,” Gavin replies with a shrug of his shoulders. “Don’t know how, don’t really care, neither. S’long as it works, no need to ask.”

“Ok…” Summer says with a lengthy exhale. “...ok, ok, ok…”

“I really can’t thank ya enough,” he continues, giving his coat a tug and letting his fingers run down the open edges of the green garment. “Really, you saved me from, well, *unpleasantness*.”

“unpleasantness,” Summer repeats softly, her eyes still wandering around her magically cleaned apartment. “What kind of… *unpleasantness*?”

“Yes, I do owe ya a nice explanation of things,” Gavin agrees, strolling around to the front of the couch.

He stands in front of it, his eyes on the woman who saved him from the *unpleasantness*, and gingerly takes a seat. The leprechaun gestures for her to join, patting the cushion beside him while scooting himself a little further away. Summer nods absently, heart racing and mind a chaotic blur of too many thoughts, fighting to keep her grip on a reality that crumbled away with little more than a flick of the leprechaun’s wrists.

“I managed to keep a pretty good hold of myself, didn’t lose my cool even a little,” he says with a smirk. “But, I have to admit, I could feel things slipping.”

“So…” she interjects while joining him on the couch, a full cushion between them, “...the dozens - *hundreds* of cups all over-”

“That- that was just- I was thirsty…” he interrupts with a lame excuse. “Was nothin’, really.”

“You sure?” Summer asks with a smirk. “I’m pretty sure you drank a coffee shop dry.”

“They’ll recover,” Gavin joked back, but he was clearly nervous with a hand rubbing the back of his neck. “Anyway, the… *unpleasantness…*”

His tone informed Summer that this was going to be a difficult conversation. Silence took hold for uncomfortable seconds, and she began to wonder if he was trying to find some way to avoid talking about it. 

“It’s probably best to spit it out,” she said encouragingly.

“Yeah,” he replied, taking a deep breath before continuing. “Magic- it’s like a drug. Sure, it’s fun at first. But, what they don’t tell ya, is how *addictive* it is. We all- the fae, uh, *fairies*, we’ve all got links to it, right? This massive, unlimited pool of magic, but… we all have to tap into it in specific ways.”

“And, your way is with gold?” Summer posits, offering him a chance to catch his breath and think about what he’s trying to say.

“In a way? As a leprechaun I gotta have gold. Specifically in coin form. Can’t just snag some nuggets or ingots, they’ve gotta be-”

He stops talking while reaching into his coat. A moment later his hand emerges again with the coin. Gavin gives the coin a little flick, then smiles while watching it spin atop his index finger. Reflected light shimmers across his face as the coin dances, and he lets the coin fall flat in his palm.

“We each give our coins a little mark, *minting* them with our magic. Every mark is different, specific to each leprechaun. I can’t tap into the magic with another leprechaun’s coin, so it doesn’t do me any good to have a random assortment.”

“Ok, makes sense,” she says, her brow furrowed behind her glasses as she moves her eyes from the coin up to Gavin.

“For the unpleasantness… if I were to go too long without one of my coins, quitting magic cold turkey, so to speak. *If* that happens, it ain’t pretty.”

“Yeah, I’m getting that,” Summer says, forcing a smirk despite her nerves.

“Being denied access to magic hurts. Like, all the way down to ya core. A fidgety, achy soul kind of hurt, that makes your bones itch. You can see how we might be inclined to get the magic through other means.”

Summer nods as she pieces things together, trying to reach the conclusion Gavin is leading her to. From what she’s been told, he wouldn’t be able to take or steal anything. But, with the addictive element of magic gnawing at him, what *would* he do? What *could* he do?

“There are laws, kinda like the ones ya have here. No stealing, no killing, stuff like that. *Our* laws, magically enforced and all, they’re more quickly and effectively enforced. Sure, we *can* take things, we *can* lie, we *can* do this and do that, but there are consequences. Even taking back my own coin, that you so correctly pointed out was *owed* to me, there would be consequences.”

“Ok, consequences like…” she starts, wondering what kind of repercussions might befall a fairy. “Probably not something as basic as jail?”

Gavin shakes his head with a sorrowful grin. It’s clear he has seen this kind of thing happen, and now *he* was the one to almost cross that line.

“The magic gotten through forbidden means is- I’ve *heard*, **more** addictive. It’s corrupted, dirty in a way. Tainted might be the best word. Those who use it bear the mark, which only becomes more and more pronounced the more they tap into it. More’n just leprechauns can tap into it like this. They’re collectively known as *the banished*, and are generally forbidden from returning to the Faelands. *These* are the ones ya hear stories about.” 

“Stories?” Summer asks, hardly realizing that she’s leaning closer to Gavin on the couch. She’s hanging on his every word, entranced like a child in a hurry to hear the rest of some captivating tale.

“Yeah, ya know, the cautionary tales about trick magic? Ya wish for one thing, and ya technically get it, but it comes at a price. Or, the wish is granted with some evil twist to it.”

Gavin glances over his shoulder to the table, spying the tie spilling out of the laptop. He absently scratches into his beard, pondering the nature of the magic his new friend has been sucked into.

“You don’t think *they*…” Summer starts, noticing where the leprechaun’s attention had gone, even briefly.

“Oh- no, probably not,” he says with a shake of his head. “The tie you got looks too… *pristine* for them to be on tainted magic.”

“Right. You’d be able to tell?”

He looks back at the table again, this time not even trying to hide where his eyes were going. The golden tie seems to shimmer despite sitting still within the confines of Summer’s laptop, a clear indication of the mystical charms woven into the fabric.

“In a way,” he begins, sighing as he settles into the couch once more. “*That* thing is too clean. Doesn’t taste like rotten magic. Something from the banished, it would have a more… uh, *icky* feel.”

Summer giggles, an unexpected relief washing through her as she relaxes on the couch. She didn’t even know she was looking for the leprechaun’s confirmation that the tooth fairies - *collectors* were on the level, but hearing it out loud made her feel more at ease.

“What’s all the scratches, though?” Gavin asks, snapping Summer out of her temporary reprieve.

“I don’t know,” she admits, pushing herself from the couch. She starts walking over to the table while continuing, “It looked like they were writing on it with a pen of some sort, but all they really did was make a mess of it.”

She picks up the laptop and starts walking back to the couch. Gavin watches her every step of the way, his subconscious fingers stroking his fiery red beard. 

“I’ve tried looking for ways to decipher or understand any of it, but it’s pretty hard when you don’t even know what you’re supposed to be looking for.”

“Really?” Gavin asks with feigned surprise. “The internet hasn’t been able to unlock the mysteries of the faerealm for ya? Shocker.”

“What would you recommend?” Summer shoots back, feeling more than a little annoyed at the clear mockery. 

She holds the laptop out after taking a seat on the couch again, the golden tie flopping from the ledge pinched around it. The leprechaun eyes the tie nervously, and shies away from the shimmering tongue when it gets too close.

“Magic, for starters,” he replies, making no effort to take the laptop from her.

“Well, I don’t have any of *that* now, do I?” she retorted, her tone more hostile than intended.

Gavin winces at her reply, feeling a hint of guilt for being overly coy. He *wants* to help the woman who just saved him from a horrific fate and knows she’ll be able to piece together what he’s saying, but feels worried about being the one to push her down a dangerous path. Part of him hopes she simply wishes it all away, even though he knows such a wish is beyond his power - what with him down to his last piece of gold, and all.

“I do…” he says softly, looking up from the dangling tie and meeting her eyes. “You… ya could *wish* to be able to read it, ya know…”

All Summer could do in that moment was stare at him. She scolds herself internally for not thinking of something so obvious. It was right there in front of her, literally, and she hadn’t even considered making a wish with her leprechaun friend. The annoyance in herself gave way to another emotion as she wondered if something like that would even be right. 

“I don’t want to take advantage or anything,” she admits, unsure whether or not she approves of using the magic Gavin just recovered.

“We’re friends, yeah?” Gavin asks with a shrug.

Summer smiles, nodding her agreement while letting the laptop drop against her thigh. The tie licked the skin beneath her crimson skirt, and she vaguely realized she had been wearing the same, haphazardly arranged attire all day.

“Great,” the leprechaun continues. He pulls the coin from some secret compartment in his coat and holds it out to her. “Why don’t we make it official, then?”

“Official?” she asks, leaning to the side to put her laptop onto the short coffee table while looking at the offered coin.

“Yeah. An official deal with a leprechaun. One coin, one wish, just as intended.”

She reaches a tentative hand forward, hesitating before her fingers can touch the polished surface again. The memory of how she felt earlier, the corruptive influence it seemed to have, how she didn’t *want* to return it to Gavin all swam through her mind as she looked into his emerald eyes. 

“Somethin’ basic, like askin’ what that tie says…” he recommends, his voice trailing off while Summer accepts his coin.

“Would this *help* you, in some way?” she asks thoughtfully, unable to keep a sly smile from curling the corners of her lips as her heart hammers in her chest.

The coin felt *good* in her hand. Like it **belonged** to her, and she should do anything and everything to keep it. She knew these thoughts and urges weren’t real, they didn’t have any natural place in her mind, but she couldn’t deny how the coin made her feel. Her reflection shimmered on the coin’s surface as she looked at it for a little too long, but Gavin’s answer pulled her from the unexpected spiral.

“Kinda?” he replies, rubbing his chin through his beard. “Guess you could say it’s like exercisin’?”

“That makes sense,” she says, trying to mentally push the golden allure from her heart. “You tap into the magic, and it’s like… magical pushups or something?”

“Best way to explain it,” he confirms, nodding his head and waiting for her to make some wish.

“Ok, ok… you’re not going to take this out of context or anything, right?” she asks with a smirk.

“No, I already *told* ya. Upstandin’ fae such as myself,” he explains, rolling back on his heels and gripping the open sides of his coat in each hand, “we don’t make twisted deals. Whatcha ask for is whatcha get.”

Summer chuckles through a grin as she tries to piece her wish together in her mind. This was all still so very new to her, and she tried to remember the wish she made with the tooth fa-*Collectors*. There hadn’t really been one, not spoken aloud, at least. Did different fairies have different requirements for granting wishes and making deals?

“I… wish to be able to read the writing on the tie,” she says, searching for the words needed to make her magical request. “That one,” the young woman adds quickly, pointing down to the tie partially closed in her laptop.

“Bipity!” Gavin says with surprising volume. “Bopity!” he continues, snatching the coin in Summer’s extended hand. “Whateva!”

Nothing happens. Gavin stashes his coin back into his coat, and looks expectantly at Summer. She doesn’t feel any different, and when she looks down at the tie she’s greeted by the same scratched/scribbled nonsense. The tie remains as mysterious as the gibberish etched into it, and she gives the leprechaun a quizzical look.

“Can ya…” he starts, gesturing down to the tie with an open hand.

Summer leans to her side and picks up the laptop. She pulls the tie from between the keyboard and screen holding it in place, but the writing is still evasive. It’s just a bunch of seemingly random scribbles looking up at her.

“No?” she replies, turning the tie over in her hand and examining it from every direction that comes to mind. “It… it didn’t work?”

“I felt the magic doin’ its tinglin’,” Gavin says with concern etched in his face. “Ya sure?”

“Yes, I’m sure,” she responds, still trying to look at the tie from that one perfect angle.

“Well- just…” the leprechaun stammers, clearly confused as he looks at the tie as well.

He doesn’t go so far as to *touch* it, but watches the fabric move in Summer’s hands. Light catches every crease and curve in the fabric, and the etched writing remains a mystery. The leprechaun *knows* it’s not just a series of random scribbles, and his shoulders slump at the realization that he failed.

“Do I get the coin back, then?” Summer asks with a smirk.

It was intended as a joke, but the hope she felt at potentially getting the coin again makes her hope the leprechaun will oblige. She lifts a hand and shakes her head, wordlessly telling Gavin that she wasn’t serious, and cautions herself internally. The attorney didn’t like the influence his coin was having on her, and she doubted she would actually want it back. Still, an annoyingly persistent part of her craved his gold.

“Sorry,” he says with a smirk of his own. “No money-back guarantees.”

“Ok, so…” she muses as she lets the tie drop down onto the laptop. “Magic was a bust. Any other recommendations?”

“Yeah, actually,” he replies. “There are a couple other ways. One kinda easy, one… *less* so. The easy way would be to find a seeing stone. Those things are pretty handy anyway, so keep ya eyes peeled for one.”

“Seeing stone,” Summer repeats, trying to figure out what he was talking about through context clues and her own memories.

“The other,” he continues without taking the time to explain the first, “is to find yaself an oracle. Oracle, or medium. This one’s trickier, since lots of the ones in ya realm are phonies.”

Summer giggles as she nods, but somehow *that* option sounded like the more simple one. She could always do a quick Google search for psychics, mediums, oracles, whatever, but she still wasn’t sure what a seeing stone was even supposed to be. A crystal ball of some sort? Would she need to find a stone that looked like an eye, or *replace* an eye with a stone? The last thought made her skin crawl, and she shivered at the idea of shoving some kind of rock into her empty eye socket.

“What’s a seeing stone?” she asked, hoping it wasn’t as morbid as the image burned into her mind.

“They’re really just a basic rock. Flat stones that have been naturally worn through the middle by wind or water. They can usually be found around rivers. I’ve got a couple, but the tricky part is - ya gotta find one yaself.”

“I have to find one?” she asks, resting a palm against the side of her forehead and scratching her fingers into her hair.

“Yeah. They don’t work if someone gives ya one. Magic is picky like that…” he says with a sigh.

“Ok… ok, so, find a specific rock out of thousands- *millions* of rocks, or… randomly stumble onto a medium that is legit. Piece of cake.”

“Sorry the wish didn’t work out,” Gavin offers as he sits onto the couch.

“It’s fine,” she replies, picking up the laptop with the tie on it like some kind of tray. “I should probably get this on its charger and head to bed.”

“Wouldn’t have a spare room, wouldja?” 

“I do, actually,” she says while turning back to face the leprechaun. “My room is through this hall to the left, the bathroom is at the end, and there is one other room on the right side of the hallway. Consider it yours, *roomie*.”",1,1731341670.0,story,0,1.0,False

Having a proper dreamcatcher hanging over one's bed, specifically right over one’s pillow, strengthens this barrier and protects the user from subconscious harm.*

*Dreamcatchers come in many varieties. Some are simply strings woven within a circular frame, resembling a spider’s web. These will help establish a barrier that cannot simply be crossed, however; as with any barrier, it can be breached. The influence of the breacher will be significantly less than if there were no dreamcatcher, but the protection offered is not absolute.*

*Another variety of dreamcatcher utilizes crystals. Each type of crystal has its own properties, so it is important to understand what crystals are being used. Some crystals can enhance the barrier, others may weaken it. It is also recommended the dreamcatcher crafter be aware of what may be trying to come through, as this may help determine what crystals will be most effective at protecting the user.* 

After climbing so many stairs yet again, Summer takes a break on her floor. She breathes deeply, drawing in long, refreshing breaths and letting the stress and strain of her recent encounter ride every exhale. Troubled thoughts tumble through her mind, and she has to tell herself over and over that she hadn’t just stolen from the nice man at the restaurant. It wasn’t *stealing*, it was… She had *repossessed* it. For someone else. Based on the testimony of one person alone, and no attempt to sort things out between the two parties. 

“*Some attorney I’ve turned out to be*,” she mutters to herself, praying what she did really was the right thing.

She had gotten so swept up in the magic and wonder of the situation, that she failed to rationalize anything. How many times had she been following a case, or listening to a podcast, whatever the case may be, and been *so certain* that one side was absolutely in the right? How many times had she sifted through evidence and testimonies *knowing* that the other side was in the wrong, only to learn that she’d been led astray? So many defense attorneys or prosecutors were so very good at what they did, spinning a narrative so convincing that-

“No,” she says aloud, running a hand through her tangled hair and letting a heavy sigh roll from her chest.

It didn’t matter. Well, it *did*, but she knew enough to be satisfied by the outcome. Didn’t she? Doubts lingered, but the evidence presented checked out. Ralv had a golden coin in his hat - a golden coin taken from a leprechaun. A weary laugh shakes through Summer at just how impossible that thought was, but it’s her life now. She *lives* in the impossible, and needs to accept it. The shop owner had made a deal with *the leprechaun*, asking for magically enhanced sandwiches in exchange for the coin being returned.

Ok. That did sound ludacris. Even accepting the events of the last… was it only two days? How was that possible? Adding to the ridiculous things in her life, she still needed to find a way to decipher the writing on the tie she had *pulled out of a dream*, assuming it even *is* writing. All of that, on top of starting a new job she very much wanted to invest her full self into, she found herself feeling a bit… overwhelmed.

“First things first,” she said to herself, then sighed again before walking down the hall to her door.

A smile stretched across her face as she slid her key into the door. She could hear Gavin on the other side, and had to keep herself from laughing when a shrill gasp rattled through the door. It was obvious before she even saw him that he was antsy, but she wasn’t prepared for the sight waiting for her right on the other side.

The heavy smell of coffee clouded the air as she moved into her apartment. She wasn’t sure how the scent hadn’t spread down the hall, and was shocked to see so many little porcelain cups on her counter, table, floor, and coffee table - a table seldom used for the caffeinated beverage. There must have been *hundreds* of the little cups scattered in disarray, with the consumer of the coffee practically vibrating while attempting to look casual against the wall. Only problem, other than the concerning amount of coffee he had undoubtedly drank, he was laying horizontal on the wall, four feet off the ground.

“Sup? uh- sup? uh- how- how did- sup?” Gavin stammered, shaking his head every time he tried to start over.

“I brought leftovers,” Summer replied, holding up the paper bag with a partially eaten sandwich and chips inside.

“Um-well, and? What- where- didja- is it?”

The leprechaun was unfathomably wired, high-strung from far too much coffee, but clearly trying to keep it together. Unfortunately for him, Summer was in a mood to play. She smirked at him, wondering how long he could hold back until he caved.

“Did I… what?” she asked, trying to be convincing as she played dumb.

“The-well- ya… ya know? Ya **do** know, right?” he asked, realizing just *how* he was resting as he slipped down the wall to his feet. “Th-the-mission- coin? The- the- the-”

“Oh, right,” Summer replied, feigning disappointment.

Gavin’s eyes were on her purse as he stood against the wall. Stains from the dark drink extended down from his lips, giving his crimson beard a dark, hectic stripe. Somehow, his green attire appeared unblemished, apart from a bit of wrinkling.

“I *knew* there was **something** I was forgetting.”

A forced laugh shivered from the leprechaun as he pushed himself off the wall, and his eyes flicked from the purse under her arm to Summer’s eyes, then back down to her purse. She set the paper bag on the discarded cups, and could feel her skin *crawl* at how much of a mess her guest had made. If he wasn’t in such disarray, she probably would have shown him the coin and told him to clean up before getting it back. Regrettably, mercy was something she had learned during her upbringing.

“You… but it’s… ya did?” Gavin sputtered, taking another step forward with his eyes practically burning a hole into Summer’s purse.

“Yes, *yes* I did,” she admits, lifting her elbow with the purse hanging from her elevated arm.

Summer opens her purse, smirking while slipping a hand into the cluttered bag. The cold, solid surface of the coin brushes across her fingers, and her heart leaps as excitement builds. Finally, she starts feeling good about what she did. Gavin’s excitement before even *seeing* his coin again has Summer feeling warm inside, and she knows what she did was just.

Gavin gasps when the coin rises from Summer’s purse. Light dances across the polished surface, casting reflected light onto the wall and ceiling as she lets it fall flat on her hand. The same symbol as the fake looks up at them both, that curly ‘2’ laying up against a cursive ‘h,’ and Summer catches herself staring into the coin.

“So… can I? Will- will ya, are ya gonna?” Gavin stutters, resisting the urge to reach out but unable to avoid looking as desperate as he is.

“Yeah,” Summer says absently, shaking her head of alien urges.

Part of her wanted to keep it. She didn’t recognize the desire to refuse Gavin his coin, and wondered if there was some kind of corruptive influence? If this coin could make her feel even *tempted* to keep it after only having it for minutes, what would happen to someone who had it on his head for *hours* at a time? She remembered Ralv’s reaction when the coin fell from his hat, how quickly he seemed to throw himself after it. Would he be able to sense the presence of the *real* coin?

She holds out her hand to Gavin, offering the coin to him without a word. It was surprisingly difficult to keep her fingers from ensnaring the coin, as if every fiber of her being *demanded* she keep it. There was an urge to pull back as the leprechaun shivered in front of her, his hands trembling as he reached for it. What was this? What were these instincts? She had never experienced anything like this before, and found a new appreciation for such corruptive magic.

Gavin gently takes his coin from her hand, fighting back tears as the familiar heft strained against his fingers. The smile on his face was unapologetically huge, showing every tooth in his slightly open mouth as he chuckled like a lunatic. He brought the coin to his lips, gave it a kiss, and every aspect of his disheveled figure vanished in a blink. It was as though he had instantly gone through a much needed makeover. The coffee staining his curly beard was gone, leaving only twisting strands of crimson, his green outfit looked freshly cleaned and ironed, and there was suddenly a pleasant, soapy scent around him.

As soon as the coin had left her hand, the weight holding Summer down from the deepest part of her soul was lifted. She inhaled deeply, her brow furrowing against the upper frame of her glasses as she realized she had been holding her breath. Summer wasn’t a fan of how quickly something as simple as a coin had influenced her, and subconsciously rubs her palm with the thumb of her other hand, as if to wipe away the memory of the coin’s touch.

The leprechaun stashes his coin away within his lengthy coat, and Summer half-heartedly hopes it might fall to the floor. She pushes the desire away, convincing herself that she’s just happy to have helped, and also to be done with whatever it was about the coin that made her feel so… different. Gavin sighs as he visibly relaxes, and they’re left standing in a silence that quickly becomes awkward.

“Well,” Gavin starts, more to cut through the suffocating quiet than anything, “that’s a weight off my shoulders, can tell ya *that* much.”

Summer smiles at him, relieved to find how quickly his words were able to ease the tension. She felt the heaviness lift away completely, and was able to breathe much more normally. The leprechaun looks her up and down quickly, then reaches out to place a hand on her shoulder.

“Thanks, really, you have **no** idea how…”

He stops. His hand remains on Summer’s shoulder as he glances around, taking in the mess he has made with scattered piles of used coffee cups. Embarrassment flushes in his cheeks, and he sheepishly grins at Summer when his eyes return to hers.

“ok… so, maybe ya do,” he admits, pulling his hand away and clapping them both together.

The noise of his hands slapping together was much too loud for a single pair. It was like a thunderclap, leaving Summer’s ears ringing as she recoiled back. She covered her stinging ears while taking a step backwards, and watched as Gavin waved his hands through the air.

“Donezies,” he says with a smile, shaking his hands as if fighting off the sting of his recent clap.

Shimmering dust falls from his fingers as he looks at the startled girl, clearly enjoying the reaction to his display. Summer looks around, slowly letting her hands fall from the sides of her face as she takes in her spotless apartment. Where there were once piles and hectic rows of discarded cups, there was now just her furniture. The countertops appeared polished, her coffee table gleamed in the overhead light, and there was a pleasant lemon scent that assured her of cleanliness, without being overpowering.

“How…” she tries, but the rest of her question refuses to meet the air.

“Magic,” Gavin replies with a shrug of his shoulders. “Don’t know how, don’t really care, neither. S’long as it works, no need to ask.”

“Ok…” Summer says with a lengthy exhale. “...ok, ok, ok…”

“I really can’t thank ya enough,” he continues, giving his coat a tug and letting his fingers run down the open edges of the green garment. “Really, you saved me from, well, *unpleasantness*.”

“unpleasantness,” Summer repeats softly, her eyes still wandering around her magically cleaned apartment. “What kind of… *unpleasantness*?”

“Yes, I do owe ya a nice explanation of things,” Gavin agrees, strolling around to the front of the couch.

He stands in front of it, his eyes on the woman who saved him from the *unpleasantness*, and gingerly takes a seat. The leprechaun gestures for her to join, patting the cushion beside him while scooting himself a little further away. Summer nods absently, heart racing and mind a chaotic blur of too many thoughts, fighting to keep her grip on a reality that crumbled away with little more than a flick of the leprechaun’s wrists.

“I managed to keep a pretty good hold of myself, didn’t lose my cool even a little,” he says with a smirk. “But, I have to admit, I could feel things slipping.”

“So…” she interjects while joining him on the couch, a full cushion between them, “...the dozens - *hundreds* of cups all over-”

“That- that was just- I was thirsty…” he interrupts with a lame excuse. “Was nothin’, really.”

“You sure?” Summer asks with a smirk. “I’m pretty sure you drank a coffee shop dry.”

“They’ll recover,” Gavin joked back, but he was clearly nervous with a hand rubbing the back of his neck. “Anyway, the… *unpleasantness…*”

His tone informed Summer that this was going to be a difficult conversation. Silence took hold for uncomfortable seconds, and she began to wonder if he was trying to find some way to avoid talking about it. 

“It’s probably best to spit it out,” she said encouragingly.

“Yeah,” he replied, taking a deep breath before continuing. “Magic- it’s like a drug. Sure, it’s fun at first. But, what they don’t tell ya, is how *addictive* it is. We all- the fae, uh, *fairies*, we’ve all got links to it, right? This massive, unlimited pool of magic, but… we all have to tap into it in specific ways.”

“And, your way is with gold?” Summer posits, offering him a chance to catch his breath and think about what he’s trying to say.

“In a way? As a leprechaun I gotta have gold. Specifically in coin form. Can’t just snag some nuggets or ingots, they’ve gotta be-”

He stops talking while reaching into his coat. A moment later his hand emerges again with the coin. Gavin gives the coin a little flick, then smiles while watching it spin atop his index finger. Reflected light shimmers across his face as the coin dances, and he lets the coin fall flat in his palm.

“We each give our coins a little mark, *minting* them with our magic. Every mark is different, specific to each leprechaun. I can’t tap into the magic with another leprechaun’s coin, so it doesn’t do me any good to have a random assortment.”

“Ok, makes sense,” she says, her brow furrowed behind her glasses as she moves her eyes from the coin up to Gavin.

“For the unpleasantness… if I were to go too long without one of my coins, quitting magic cold turkey, so to speak. *If* that happens, it ain’t pretty.”

“Yeah, I’m getting that,” Summer says, forcing a smirk despite her nerves.

“Being denied access to magic hurts. Like, all the way down to ya core. A fidgety, achy soul kind of hurt, that makes your bones itch. You can see how we might be inclined to get the magic through other means.”

Summer nods as she pieces things together, trying to reach the conclusion Gavin is leading her to. From what she’s been told, he wouldn’t be able to take or steal anything. But, with the addictive element of magic gnawing at him, what *would* he do? What *could* he do?

“There are laws, kinda like the ones ya have here. No stealing, no killing, stuff like that. *Our* laws, magically enforced and all, they’re more quickly and effectively enforced. Sure, we *can* take things, we *can* lie, we *can* do this and do that, but there are consequences. Even taking back my own coin, that you so correctly pointed out was *owed* to me, there would be consequences.”

“Ok, consequences like…” she starts, wondering what kind of repercussions might befall a fairy. “Probably not something as basic as jail?”

Gavin shakes his head with a sorrowful grin. It’s clear he has seen this kind of thing happen, and now *he* was the one to almost cross that line.

“The magic gotten through forbidden means is- I’ve *heard*, **more** addictive. It’s corrupted, dirty in a way. Tainted might be the best word. Those who use it bear the mark, which only becomes more and more pronounced the more they tap into it. More’n just leprechauns can tap into it like this. They’re collectively known as *the banished*, and are generally forbidden from returning to the Faelands. *These* are the ones ya hear stories about.” 

“Stories?” Summer asks, hardly realizing that she’s leaning closer to Gavin on the couch. She’s hanging on his every word, entranced like a child in a hurry to hear the rest of some captivating tale.

“Yeah, ya know, the cautionary tales about trick magic? Ya wish for one thing, and ya technically get it, but it comes at a price. Or, the wish is granted with some evil twist to it.”

Gavin glances over his shoulder to the table, spying the tie spilling out of the laptop. He absently scratches into his beard, pondering the nature of the magic his new friend has been sucked into.

“You don’t think *they*…” Summer starts, noticing where the leprechaun’s attention had gone, even briefly.

“Oh- no, probably not,” he says with a shake of his head. “The tie you got looks too… *pristine* for them to be on tainted magic.”

“Right. You’d be able to tell?”

He looks back at the table again, this time not even trying to hide where his eyes were going. The golden tie seems to shimmer despite sitting still within the confines of Summer’s laptop, a clear indication of the mystical charms woven into the fabric.

“In a way,” he begins, sighing as he settles into the couch once more. “*That* thing is too clean. Doesn’t taste like rotten magic. Something from the banished, it would have a more… uh, *icky* feel.”

Summer giggles, an unexpected relief washing through her as she relaxes on the couch. She didn’t even know she was looking for the leprechaun’s confirmation that the tooth fairies - *collectors* were on the level, but hearing it out loud made her feel more at ease.

“What’s all the scratches, though?” Gavin asks, snapping Summer out of her temporary reprieve.

“I don’t know,” she admits, pushing herself from the couch. She starts walking over to the table while continuing, “It looked like they were writing on it with a pen of some sort, but all they really did was make a mess of it.”

She picks up the laptop and starts walking back to the couch. Gavin watches her every step of the way, his subconscious fingers stroking his fiery red beard. 

“I’ve tried looking for ways to decipher or understand any of it, but it’s pretty hard when you don’t even know what you’re supposed to be looking for.”

“Really?” Gavin asks with feigned surprise. “The internet hasn’t been able to unlock the mysteries of the faerealm for ya? Shocker.”

“What would you recommend?” Summer shoots back, feeling more than a little annoyed at the clear mockery. 

She holds the laptop out after taking a seat on the couch again, the golden tie flopping from the ledge pinched around it. The leprechaun eyes the tie nervously, and shies away from the shimmering tongue when it gets too close.

“Magic, for starters,” he replies, making no effort to take the laptop from her.

“Well, I don’t have any of *that* now, do I?” she retorted, her tone more hostile than intended.

Gavin winces at her reply, feeling a hint of guilt for being overly coy. He *wants* to help the woman who just saved him from a horrific fate and knows she’ll be able to piece together what he’s saying, but feels worried about being the one to push her down a dangerous path. Part of him hopes she simply wishes it all away, even though he knows such a wish is beyond his power - what with him down to his last piece of gold, and all.

“I do…” he says softly, looking up from the dangling tie and meeting her eyes. “You… ya could *wish* to be able to read it, ya know…”

All Summer could do in that moment was stare at him. She scolds herself internally for not thinking of something so obvious. It was right there in front of her, literally, and she hadn’t even considered making a wish with her leprechaun friend. The annoyance in herself gave way to another emotion as she wondered if something like that would even be right. 

“I don’t want to take advantage or anything,” she admits, unsure whether or not she approves of using the magic Gavin just recovered.

“We’re friends, yeah?” Gavin asks with a shrug.

Summer smiles, nodding her agreement while letting the laptop drop against her thigh. The tie licked the skin beneath her crimson skirt, and she vaguely realized she had been wearing the same, haphazardly arranged attire all day.

“Great,” the leprechaun continues. He pulls the coin from some secret compartment in his coat and holds it out to her. “Why don’t we make it official, then?”

“Official?” she asks, leaning to the side to put her laptop onto the short coffee table while looking at the offered coin.

“Yeah. An official deal with a leprechaun. One coin, one wish, just as intended.”

She reaches a tentative hand forward, hesitating before her fingers can touch the polished surface again. The memory of how she felt earlier, the corruptive influence it seemed to have, how she didn’t *want* to return it to Gavin all swam through her mind as she looked into his emerald eyes. 

“Somethin’ basic, like askin’ what that tie says…” he recommends, his voice trailing off while Summer accepts his coin.

“Would this *help* you, in some way?” she asks thoughtfully, unable to keep a sly smile from curling the corners of her lips as her heart hammers in her chest.

The coin felt *good* in her hand. Like it **belonged** to her, and she should do anything and everything to keep it. She knew these thoughts and urges weren’t real, they didn’t have any natural place in her mind, but she couldn’t deny how the coin made her feel. Her reflection shimmered on the coin’s surface as she looked at it for a little too long, but Gavin’s answer pulled her from the unexpected spiral.

“Kinda?” he replies, rubbing his chin through his beard. “Guess you could say it’s like exercisin’?”

“That makes sense,” she says, trying to mentally push the golden allure from her heart. “You tap into the magic, and it’s like… magical pushups or something?”

“Best way to explain it,” he confirms, nodding his head and waiting for her to make some wish.

“Ok, ok… you’re not going to take this out of context or anything, right?” she asks with a smirk.

“No, I already *told* ya. Upstandin’ fae such as myself,” he explains, rolling back on his heels and gripping the open sides of his coat in each hand, “we don’t make twisted deals. Whatcha ask for is whatcha get.”

Summer chuckles through a grin as she tries to piece her wish together in her mind. This was all still so very new to her, and she tried to remember the wish she made with the tooth fa-*Collectors*. There hadn’t really been one, not spoken aloud, at least. Did different fairies have different requirements for granting wishes and making deals?

“I… wish to be able to read the writing on the tie,” she says, searching for the words needed to make her magical request. “That one,” the young woman adds quickly, pointing down to the tie partially closed in her laptop.

“Bipity!” Gavin says with surprising volume. “Bopity!” he continues, snatching the coin in Summer’s extended hand. “Whateva!”

Nothing happens. Gavin stashes his coin back into his coat, and looks expectantly at Summer. She doesn’t feel any different, and when she looks down at the tie she’s greeted by the same scratched/scribbled nonsense. The tie remains as mysterious as the gibberish etched into it, and she gives the leprechaun a quizzical look.

“Can ya…” he starts, gesturing down to the tie with an open hand.

Summer leans to her side and picks up the laptop. She pulls the tie from between the keyboard and screen holding it in place, but the writing is still evasive. It’s just a bunch of seemingly random scribbles looking up at her.

“No?” she replies, turning the tie over in her hand and examining it from every direction that comes to mind. “It… it didn’t work?”

“I felt the magic doin’ its tinglin’,” Gavin says with concern etched in his face. “Ya sure?”

“Yes, I’m sure,” she responds, still trying to look at the tie from that one perfect angle.

“Well- just…” the leprechaun stammers, clearly confused as he looks at the tie as well.

He doesn’t go so far as to *touch* it, but watches the fabric move in Summer’s hands. Light catches every crease and curve in the fabric, and the etched writing remains a mystery. The leprechaun *knows* it’s not just a series of random scribbles, and his shoulders slump at the realization that he failed.

“Do I get the coin back, then?” Summer asks with a smirk.

It was intended as a joke, but the hope she felt at potentially getting the coin again makes her hope the leprechaun will oblige. She lifts a hand and shakes her head, wordlessly telling Gavin that she wasn’t serious, and cautions herself internally. The attorney didn’t like the influence his coin was having on her, and she doubted she would actually want it back. Still, an annoyingly persistent part of her craved his gold.

“Sorry,” he says with a smirk of his own. “No money-back guarantees.”

“Ok, so…” she muses as she lets the tie drop down onto the laptop. “Magic was a bust. Any other recommendations?”

“Yeah, actually,” he replies. “There are a couple other ways. One kinda easy, one… *less* so. The easy way would be to find a seeing stone. Those things are pretty handy anyway, so keep ya eyes peeled for one.”

“Seeing stone,” Summer repeats, trying to figure out what he was talking about through context clues and her own memories.

“The other,” he continues without taking the time to explain the first, “is to find yaself an oracle. Oracle, or medium. This one’s trickier, since lots of the ones in ya realm are phonies.”

Summer giggles as she nods, but somehow *that* option sounded like the more simple one. She could always do a quick Google search for psychics, mediums, oracles, whatever, but she still wasn’t sure what a seeing stone was even supposed to be. A crystal ball of some sort? Would she need to find a stone that looked like an eye, or *replace* an eye with a stone? The last thought made her skin crawl, and she shivered at the idea of shoving some kind of rock into her empty eye socket.

“What’s a seeing stone?” she asked, hoping it wasn’t as morbid as the image burned into her mind.

“They’re really just a basic rock. Flat stones that have been naturally worn through the middle by wind or water. They can usually be found around rivers. I’ve got a couple, but the tricky part is - ya gotta find one yaself.”

“I have to find one?” she asks, resting a palm against the side of her forehead and scratching her fingers into her hair.

“Yeah. They don’t work if someone gives ya one. Magic is picky like that…” he says with a sigh.

“Ok… ok, so, find a specific rock out of thousands- *millions* of rocks, or… randomly stumble onto a medium that is legit. Piece of cake.”

“Sorry the wish didn’t work out,” Gavin offers as he sits onto the couch.

“It’s fine,” she replies, picking up the laptop with the tie on it like some kind of tray. “I should probably get this on its charger and head to bed.”

“Wouldn’t have a spare room, wouldja?” 

“I do, actually,” she says while turning back to face the leprechaun. “My room is through this hall to the left, the bathroom is at the end, and there is one other room on the right side of the hallway. Consider it yours, *roomie*.”",1,1731341635.0,stories,0,1.0,False
