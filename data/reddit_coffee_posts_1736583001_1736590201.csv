1hysvt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1hysvt4/im_so_tired/,I'm so tired ,"Bear with me, I'm rambling.

For background, I (39f) am not diagnosed with epilepsy, but under investigation to determine if I have epilepsy or non-epileptic seizures. 

Feb 2, 2024, I woke up for work and started getting ready. Was hit with intense waves of nausea, got extremely hot and sweaty, and palpitations. Weird feeling in my head and the overwhelming thought that I'd been poisoned. I decided to go downstairs to lay on the sofa as I thought if I was going vomit, it'd be easier to clean up on the hard floor. I made it to the bottom of the stairs and everything started looking funny and my hands seemed really far away. Couldn't get any words out to get my roommate's attention as he was in the kitchen and I was terrified he was going to be poisoned too (I couldn't shake that thought).

 I remember thinking I should sit on the floor before I fell down because I was so hot and the floor was cold. I remember going to the floor, then nothing else and I was sat on the sofa in the living room and trying to call my boyfriend because I needed help.

 I don't remember much about it, but eventually ended up in the hospital overnight. Had a CT scan. I was seen by 3 different neurology consultants, and the lead neuro diagnosed me with FND and migraines after a 15 minute conversation/exam. Told to take riboflavin, visit the neuro symptoms website and not go googling all my issues and try CBT.  One of the other consultants made a point of coming back to talk to me and my boyfriend and tell me that she disagreed with the diagnosis as she'd spoken with anyone who had interacted with me during my intake all the way to the EMTs who brought me in and to do my research, and though she was in disagreement, she had to defer to her senior colleagues differential.

I spent all the rest of February and March and the beginning of April 2024 unable to function. I couldn't talk without a stutter, I couldn't remember things, I was off balance and purchased a cane to be able to walk, couldn't hardly get out of bed most days and constantly had internal tremors, body pain, and always felt drunk or in a fog. Had an MRI in early March and was waiting for the results. 

April 6. I had had a good morning. Had walked to a coffee shop in town with my boyfriend and just having a good morning in general. He went home and I was laying in bed. My left leg started jerking and the sensation ran up my body and snapped my head to the right. Then it happened again. And again. Went downstairs and almost fell down them because I had started shaking all over.

 Long story short, I ended up in the hospital again for a week and had around 35 seizures during that time. I was told my MRI was clear, and I was having ""pseudoseizures"" because I had been told I had FND in February, I'd ""stop having them when I decided to stop having them"" and sent on my way. 

I had convulsive seizures almost daily until around August when they slowed down and started primarily occurring around my period and ovulation and under times of extreme stress. They're mostly focal unaware types now with an occasional bout of progressing to convulsive, I always have an aura beforehand and they cluster, but until recently never went beyond 4.5 minutes. I stopped stuttering constantly and now only do so during an aura or after a seizure. I don't remember my seizures and lose memories of things constantly.

My MRI wasn't clear, btw. I have tiny lesions in my right thalamus and deep white matter that are indicative of chronic small vessel ischemic disease, along with bulging discs in my t7/8 and sinusitis. My bloodwork is always off. I'm diabetic (type 2), I've developed inappropriate sinus tachycardia and other symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, I might have metabolic liver disease (formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), I have high cholesterol,I might have some kind of connective tissue disorder, and I probably have endometriosis &/or adenomyosis.  I was walking 6+ miles a day this time last year and had lost 90+lbs in a year trying to get healthy (from 292-208lbs, I'm 5'10""). I was discharged early from PT because they didn't know where to start with therapy. I was discharged early from CBT because I'm not anxious or depressed (although I have a history of anxiety and depression since a teen).

My current neurologist wasn't convinced when I seen him privately that I was having non-epilectic seizures. He was thinking TLE and focals. He watched videos my partner took and listened to all of my symptoms and suggested he put me on his NHS list for the epilepsy team to discuss. I talked to him two weeks ago and he now says that the one of the videos that he saw before looks like a panic attack. It's not a damn panic attack. I am NOT there. 

I've had endo surgery delayed to sort of the cardiac issues and ensure it's nothing major with my heart and was told by that gyno that she wasn't concerned about the seizures. Only to have the surgery rescheduled and then subsequently cancelled by her because of the seizures. 

I've had a rheumatology referral denied because I'm not hypermobile enough. 

I'm tired. I'm tired of seizures and doctors and consultants and pills and prescriptions. I'm tired of symptoms and comorbidities and stress. I'm tired of applying for PIP and government aid and occupational health and trying to convince my workplace to let me WFH for as long as possible because I can't walk for long enough without feeling like I'm dying. I'm tired of fatigue and feeling like a burden and forgetting everything all the fucking time. I'm tired of people not understanding my new limitations. I'm tired of explaining everything over and over and over.  I'm tired of having to fight constantly to be listened to and taken seriously. 

I feel awful every single day, yes some days are better than others but I physically feel fucking terrible in some way every day. 

The only person who has been by my side through everything is my boyfriend and I know he's terrified. 

I had back to back clusters of convulsive and focal unaware type seizures a couple of days ago for TWO HOURS. My boyfriend had the ambulance service out and they kept telling him that I wasn't having 'real' seizures and trying to get me to talk and get dressed and walk downstairs to get in the ambulance and go to the hospital. I became combative and he was told that that doesn't happen with epilepsy and because they took my vitals when I wasn't seizing and drooling and hypoventilating and was looking around during a focal (according to what my boyfriend witnessed), I was fine and let me wave my hand on a screen and said to follow up with my GP. 

I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING about this. I had peed myself and my boyfriend said at one point I was choking on my own saliva. I remember feeling like someone was grabbing me at some point and that people were looming over me and screaming at me. My head has been aching and two days later I still feel like I pulled all the muscles in my back and neck. I feel drunk and just...off. I couldn't get an appointment with my GP because it apparently didn't warrant an emergency slot and I didn't call in at 8am. 

I'm honestly just on the verge of losing hope that I'll get any help. I'll be living with whatever type of seizures I'm having for the rest of my life and will lose everything and everyone. I will be nothing but a depressed burden on everyone. I'm just so so tired.

Surgery and radiation eventually put me in remission but left me scarred and unable to have vaginal penetration. It took me time to accept my new body, but finally I’m ready to date again.

So I matched with ‘Jay’ (46M) on Tinder. We messaged for a couple of weeks, then had 2 coffee dates and finally a dinner that ended up with the two of us making out on a couch. As he started trying to enter me I gently guided him away and asked to let me give him a BJ instead. He reluctantly agreed, I finished him off, and then naturally he asked me why I didn’t want to have an intercourse. This is when I explained that cancer treatment had altered my body and that penetrative sex was not an option for me.

Jay got visibly upset. He told me I should’ve been explicit about my ‘condition’ from the beginning. He said he was not sure he could be in a relationship like that and that the fact I didn’t tell him right away was a major red flag.

1hysu5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchoolOfPlyLaunch/comments/1hysu5p/talent_on_standby/,Talent on Standby?,"Have you sent your CV to an executive talent agency? “We’re too busy to meet for coffee. Please fill out this form online, and we’ll get back to you if something fits.” You wait—and wait.  They never call. Meanwhile, your professional life feels frozen, your motivation slipping, and you watch a gap grow on your CV like a silent indictment of your worth.  
  
Traditional recruitment is broken. Executive search agencies and online job boards amass thousands of static résumés. They filter applicants through narrow criteria, old systems, old methods—education, job titles, keywords—without  knowing who you are or what you can do and what you are capable of. For those between roles, the emptiness becomes stifling. Days grow long, mental health suffers, and it seems as if all your experience—years of it, sometimes across multiple industries—means nothing. Once you fall out, it can be very hard to come back.  
  
**Talent on Standby**  
  
It’s not just your problem; it’s an economic and social one. Skilled, motivated people languish for lack of a better system. Doors don’t open, and time slips away. In that in-between phase, confidence plummets. The label “unemployed” hangs around your neck, obscuring the fact that you have ideas, drive, and expertise.   
  
Enter School of Ply (SOP)School of Ply was born out of this frustration. Instead of passively waiting for the job market to “discover” you, SOP lets us redefine our professional identity here and now: By always having something real to work on—collaborating on projects, tackling creative challenges, building out your portfolio in a way that goes beyond a static CV. Working as a team.  
  
**Proof of Work:** Not Just Words-Your involvement in SOP is proof of your capacity—verifiable outputs not just lines on a CV.  
  
**Mental Well-Being:** You sidestep the downward spiral of waiting and rejection. You’re part of a living, breathing community and making movement:

>**Unless we are in movement, doors do not open, -because they don't have to.**

**A Radical Perspective on “Gaps”**  
  
Instead of dreading these intervals as destructive “gaps,” we treat them as opportunities to explore bold ideas, learn new skills, and forge meaningful collaborations and build strong networks. This mindset flips the script: you’re not “unemployed,” ""redundant"" or stuck in a job that does not challenge you—you’re a Fellow at SOP, actively pursuing innovation and impact. We own SOP together - we ply´ ourselves.  
  
**Reclaiming Momentum**  
  
Doors open for those in motion. By constantly creating, you’re building a portfolio of verifiable work onchain that speaks louder than any CV. You’re also signaling to potential employers or collaborators that you’re resourceful, proactive, and unstoppable. Your LinkedIn status as Fellow, is real.  
  
**Why We Need You**  
  
The idea behind SOP isn’t just personal; it’s collective. If you’ve looked around your own network of friends and colleagues, you know there’s incredible talent sitting on the sidelines. Think of what happens that potential is activated, rather than left waiting for a recruiter’s nod. We believe in a future where people define their own professional narrative by staying engaged, imaginative, and collaborative—every single day.  
  
**Join the Movement**  
  
School of Ply is a new way of working, learning, and living. It’s about refusing to let gatekeepers decide our value. It’s about staying fresh, connected, and confident. If you’re done with waiting and want to reclaim your power, we welcome you to apply to join. Let’s turn “gaps” into opportunities for growth, invention, and real progress—both for ourselves and for a world that needs our collective talent.Because standing still keeps doors closed.

1hyssmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1hyssmx/passed_pmp_attt/,Passed PMP - AT/T/T,"**TLDR**: Passed the PMP while being a full-time dad. It's not about memorizing - it's about becoming a different person.

Like many of you, I thought getting PMP certified was just about cramming processes into my brain. Plot twist: it wasn't.

The real deal? It's about transforming into someone who can beast mode through 180 questions in 4 hours without losing their mind. And I did this while juggling the full dad package - morning bus stops, afternoon bus stops, bedtime stories, and everything in between.

**The Stats:**

* 35 hours of courses
* 177 practice questions
* 14 exams
* Countless cups of coffee
* 1 badly timed norovirus (**pro tip**: don't get sick 4 days before your exam)

By day, I was the guy camping out at Starbucks, probably looking like a sleep-deprived zombie. By night, I was drilling practice questions while my kids' bedtime playlist played in the background. Had positive affirmations on my mirror like some wannabe motivational guru - but hey, it worked.

The kicker? Got hit with norovirus right before the exam. But at that point, I wasn't just preparing for a test - I'd become someone different. Someone who could turn ""I will"" into ""I did.""

Here's the real truth: You don't pass the PMP. You become the kind of person who passes the PMP.

I'd like to find a more elevated experience than my typical stuff, but don't know much of anything about the different kinds of beer. I've tried quite a few in my day but mostly drink mass produced slop from the grocery store. Feel free to absolutely roast my unrefined palate.


Location: AL, USA


**Beers I have enjoyed:**

  - Corona. This is my go to, BYOB to the barbecue type beer. Drop in a lime, hint of sweet with a hint of citrus added to a beer that tastes like nothing.

  - Blue Moon Belgian White. This is an every once in a while, if I can find it on tap.

  - North Coast PranQster. This is probably the best beer i've ever had. It's delicious and way more complex than anything else i've ever drank.

  - New Castle Brown Ale. This one was hit and miss. I've had one six pack that tasted like heaven on earth and another that tasted like pond water.

  - Ghost Train Kaleidoscope Kettle Sour. I had a huge sour kick for about a year and drank this beer until I got sick of it.

  - Gulden Draak. A beer head friend of mine drinks this. The initial sweetness with an almost toffee flavor really hit the spot, but the bitter aftertaste knocked it down a few pegs. Would still drink again.



**Beers I have not enjoyed:**


  - Pretty much every IPA i've ever tried. Tastes like grass and poison. Like licking the yard after a good soaking of round-up.

  - Rogue Dead Guy. Tried a sip and thought it was good. Bought a six pack and couldn't even finish the first bottle. Gave away to a friend.

  - Guinness. I've been told we dont have the ""good stuff"" here in America. Tasted like stale coffee accidentally poured into the cup I keep my loose change in.

  - Dragons Milk. Purchased on a recommendation from a friend. Took one sip, gave the rest away. Carbonated soy sauce, yum.

  - Heineken. I would rather eat a lit cigarette than ever touch a bottle of this to my lips again.

  - Andy Gator. My dad drinks this. I almost needed the un-alive hotline after this one.



Budget: I would probably not pay more than 20$ for a six pack. Times are tough, and beer aint free.


TL;DR: Likes toffee, caramel, sweet, sour, wheaty, malty, fruity. Dislikes bitter, metallic, grassy, soy sauce. Light or heavy is fine, I like to drink in moderation and usually don't have to worry about feeling full or sick. Any ABV is fine. If you absolutely need a number i'd say 6% or above.

I'm so stressed, feel like I'm drowning and and barely getting up for air. 

Last May my family and I recently moved to a new area. We were hopeful and our friends encouraged us to come to this area for school and work. We moved for the main goal to go to school because it's very affordable compared to colleges up north. As soon as we came we realized it was not going to be easy. Jobs here seemed to be available but were not. It took my husband 4 months to get hired. At the time my baby was 5 months old so I was staying at home taking care of her and doing Instacart to be able to pay any bills I could. So my husband began school which I'm so proud of him, and the goal is to graduate and find a great job and relocate up north. I also want to get a degree that will help me find something that will pay me better but I would probably need to do it online since I have my baby and I can't afford to pay for daycare and we don't have any family. My husband's family lives in another country and I don't have any.
Fortunately, 2 months ago my mother-in-law came and is helping me out taking care of our baby.

Its January 9th
This is my daughter's first birthday. I'm working for Instacart to make an extra bit for my baby's birthday and to go get her a birthday cake. I got a phone call from my mother-in-law telling me to come home she didn't tell me why I felt something was wrong. Then 5 min later I get a call from my husband to pick him up from work first. (we have one car) so I rushed to get to his job and got there and he told me he had two things to tell me, he said I'll tell you the first now but the second I have to tell you when we get home. He said he just got fired. We just both in shock because he always got compliments for his hard work and they would make him work over time. They also fired five other coworkers because work is slow they said. 
When we arrived home he told me there had been an accident with his daughter she got burnt. 

I freaked out ran inside and when I saw my baby I was balling my eye out I was just scared for her. I instantly knew she was not herself because every time she saw me coming home she had the biggest smile he is such a happy baby. I grabbed her and ran to the emergency room. (My baby was in her stroller in the kitchen while my mother-in-law was preparing breakfast. She put her coffee on the table and there was a napkin under it, my baby saw it and pulled the napkin and the coffee spilled on her.) The doctor said she was fine, she had first and second-degree burns. It was red with a few blisters on her tummy. She's a strong girl but all this happened on her birthday and just feel terrible as a mom. But I know all of this was out of my control.

So I'm writing this because I can't sleep up at 4 am. I'm thinking about how I'm going to pay my bills they are already backed up because the job my husband makes only covered the rent and car but everything else was my responsibility. 

I already have the government benefits for food. But diapers are expensive and I'm trying to get my baby off of formula because it's so expensive I'm paying $33 just for 1 can of formula. I want to give up sometimes but I can't think like that because my family needs me. 

Now it's snowing and I just went outside this area is not used to the snow so there's no salt to put out on the road. And it's also icy. I wanted to go to work today to make as much as I can. It seems like I can't. 

I'll be searching for jobs. And do the best I can. It's just a big bump on the road but it will get better.

I don't care to hear that. I don't need to add to my anxiety about feeling worse than I do now. 

I wouldn't say I'm sick enough to warrant complaining but the constant, underlying, nausea that is just a constant since the day i found out I was pregnant over a month ago is started to slowly chip away at me. 

I'm not vomiting but it's like I'm hungry but the idea of eating anything makes me feel nauseous. Then when I finally get an appetite, I take a bite and then I don't feel well. All the seems to work is a 50 cent bowl of basic ramen or cold mangoes 
. People keep asking me if I have cravings and I don't know what I am supposed to be craving when literally everything under the sun makes me feel nauseous.

Pizza? 2 bites in .. ew
Forget about eating meat.. 🤢 
My prenatals.. well to take those I have to eat something otherwise I feel extremely sea sick.. and nothing looks appetizing except cold mangoes . I can't just eat cold mangoes and ramen everyday.. that's not balanced nutrition

Then on top of that.. I am so constipated. I feel like I have to poop and I have to strain myself to do it. This adds to my nausea and then I'm up every night at 2-3 AM just wide awake cause I have to pee, I suddenly feel the urge to poop, my mouth is dry and then the nausea starts...the fatigue but then there is a snow storm so I've been in bed for 2 days and now feel tired of being tired... like I want to go do something but the moment I get out of bed I'm hit with this cloud of nausea  

I feel bad complaining about it cause I don't have debilitating nausea.. it's just enough for me to feel sick unless I lay down facing the left and sleeping on my stomach is so cozy.. and I never usually sleep on my stomach. I just feel like I'm  one strong smell or disgusting meat dish away from vommittkng everywhere . 😭

1hyspkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hyspkh/how_to_pick_the_perfect_rug_size_for_your_room/,How to Pick the Perfect Rug Size for Your Room,"Choosing the right rug size for your room can make a significant difference in the overall look and feel of your space. Whether you're working with a small apartment or a spacious home, the right rug can anchor your furniture, define areas, and elevate your interior style. From large [carpets and rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) to smaller accent pieces, selecting the right size ensures harmony and balance in your home decor.

**Why Rug Size Matters**

A rug that's too small can make a room feel disjointed, while one that's too large can overwhelm the space. Striking the perfect balance depends on understanding the room’s layout, furniture placement, and the function of the area. Here's a room-by-room guide to help you select the perfect size rug.

# 1. Living Room: Define Your Space

The living room is often the centerpiece of your home, and the right rug size can tie everything together. Ideally, your rug should be large enough to fit under the front legs of your sofa and other seating. For a cohesive look, the rug should extend at least 6-8 inches beyond the furniture edges.

* **Tip:** If you're creating a cozy seating area, consider large [rugs for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) that can accommodate all the furniture legs.
* **Style Suggestion:** A [light grey carpet](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/etienne-rug-grey) works beautifully in modern or minimalist living rooms, adding sophistication and complementing neutral tones.

# 2. Dining Room: Functionality Meets Elegance

In a dining room, the rug should be large enough to fit under the table and chairs, even when the chairs are pulled out. A good rule of thumb is to add 24-30 inches to all sides of your dining table dimensions.

* **Tip:** Choose a low-pile rug or [white carpet](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) for a clean and elegant look, ensuring it's easy to maintain.
* **Bonus Idea:** Neutral-toned carpets and rugs can seamlessly blend with various table styles, from rustic wood to modern glass designs.

# 3. Bedroom: Soft Comfort Underfoot

In the bedroom, the rug should provide a soft landing spot when you step out of bed. Place a large rug under the bottom two-thirds of your bed, extending it on all sides. Alternatively, use runners on each side of the bed for a layered look.

* **Style Idea:** A light grey carpet under a white or pastel bedspread can create a serene and inviting atmosphere.
* **Small Space Tip:** For compact bedrooms, opt for smaller carpets and rugs to fit the dimensions without overcrowding the space.

# 4. Hallways and Entryways: Narrow but Impactful

Hallways and entryways often benefit from runners or small rugs. Ensure the rug leaves about 4-6 inches of space between its edges and the walls to frame the area beautifully.

* **Maintenance Tip:** A white carpet or light-colored rug may look stunning, but opt for durable materials that can handle high foot traffic in these areas.

# 5. Home Office: Define Your Workspace

Adding a rug to your home office can create a cozy and professional feel. Choose a rug that fits under your desk and chair, leaving space for movement. If your workspace is part of a larger room, use the rug to define the area.

* **Pro Tip:** A light grey carpet with subtle patterns can reduce visual noise and promote focus.

# Common Rug Sizes and How to Use Them

Understanding standard rug sizes can help you make informed decisions:

* **5' x 8':** Perfect for small living rooms, bedrooms, or under coffee tables.
* **8' x 10':** Ideal for larger living rooms, dining rooms, or beneath queen-size beds.
* **9' x 12':** Best for spacious rooms with a lot of furniture.

**Choosing the Right Material and Color**

* **Light Grey Carpet:** Versatile and modern, a light grey rug works well in living rooms and bedrooms, pairing beautifully with both warm and cool tones.
* **White Carpet:** Creates a bright, clean aesthetic but requires regular maintenance, making it ideal for low-traffic areas or homes without pets.
* **Carpets and Rugs:** Explore a range of textures and materials, such as wool, jute, or synthetic blends, to suit the room’s function and style.

**Final Thoughts**

Selecting the right rug size is about balancing proportions and creating a cohesive design. Whether you're looking for carpets and rugs for a living room or a light grey carpet for a modern touch, the perfect size can make all the difference. Don't shy away from experimenting with colors like a pristine white carpet or classic neutrals to match your unique style.

I'm so stressed, feel like I'm drowning and and barely getting up for air. 

Last May my family and I recently moved to a new area. We were hopeful and our friends encouraged us to come to this area for school and work. We moved for the main goal to go to school because it's very affordable compared to colleges up north. As soon as we came we realized it was not going to be easy. Jobs here seemed to be available but were not. It took my husband 4 months to get hired. At the time my baby was 5 months old so I was staying at home taking care of her and doing Instacart to be able to pay any bills I could. So my husband began school which I'm so proud of him, and the goal is to graduate and find a great job and relocate up north. I also want to get a degree that will help me find something that will pay me better but I would probably need to do it online since I have my baby and I can't afford to pay for daycare and we don't have any family. My husband's family lives in another country and I don't have any.
Fortunately, 2 months ago my mother-in-law came and is helping me out taking care of our baby.

Its January 9th
This is my daughter's first birthday. I'm working for Instacart to make an extra bit for my baby's birthday and to go get her a birthday cake. I got a phone call from my mother-in-law telling me to come home she didn't tell me why I felt something was wrong. Then 5 min later I get a call from my husband to pick him up from work first. (we have one car) so I rushed to get to his job and got there and he told me he had two things to tell me, he said I'll tell you the first now but the second I have to tell you when we get home. He said he just got fired. We just both in shock because he always got compliments for his hard work and they would make him work over time. They also fired five other coworkers because work is slow they said. 
When we arrived home he told me there had been an accident with his daughter she got burnt. 

I freaked out ran inside and when I saw my baby I was balling my eye out I was just scared for her. I instantly knew she was not herself because every time she saw me coming home she had the biggest smile he is such a happy baby. I grabbed her and ran to the emergency room. (My baby was in her stroller in the kitchen while my mother-in-law was preparing breakfast. She put her coffee on the table and there was a napkin under it, my baby saw it and pulled the napkin and the coffee spilled on her.) The doctor said she was fine, she had first and second-degree burns. It was red with a few blisters on her tummy. She's a strong girl but all this happened on her birthday and just feel terrible as a mom. But I know all of this was out of my control.

So I'm writing this because I can't sleep up at 4 am. I'm thinking about how I'm going to pay my bills they are already backed up because the job my husband makes only covered the rent and car but everything else was my responsibility. 

I already have the government benefits for food. But diapers are expensive and I'm trying to get my baby off of formula because it's so expensive I'm paying $33 just for 1 can of formula. I want to give up sometimes but I can't think like that because my family needs me. 

Now it's snowing and I just went outside this area is not used to the snow so there's no salt to put out on the road. And it's also icy. I wanted to go to work today to make as much as I can. It seems like I can't. 

I'll be searching for jobs. And do the best I can. It's just a big bump on the road but it will get better.

We met in 2019 through Tinder. He just got out of a relationship and I got dared by my best friend to make a tinder profile. So we both decided to give tinder a chance. Honestly neither of us was expecting anything. After some left and right swiping, we matched with each others. After some chit chat we decided to meet up at a city where we both studied in. 

First time meeting my husband was insane, he mentioned already that he was tall, bur seeing him with his 2 meters right in front of me (I am 1.64) was pretty surreal! I even had slight doubts if the length would be a dealbreaker, but thankfully it wasn’t. 

We went out for coffee and chitchat a lot, planning our follow up date to a Zoo! Ironically we both love turtles and nature, so the date idea was perfect. 

We wrapped our first date up, we went to the main station to both go home. And he gave me a small peck on the lips!

We kept talking to each other full with dreams, ideas and love.

Our date in the zoo was the best! The zoo was so pretty and it was so comfy and fun! 

We dated for some time and in 2022 we purchased our own home! We started to renovate this home together with family and friends! At the end of 2023, the time was finally there and we were able to move in! ( In the meantime I had to live with my husband at his in laws, as my work was in his city. But my god, never again. I do not recommend this.) 

We went on a holiday to France in 2024, where he went on his knee for me. The place and everything was beautiful (not over the top, we both do not like this!) and of course I had to say Yes! 

At the end of 2024, we got ‘married’ (we are in a pact, how we call it is marriage without all the full and BS around it) But I can finally call him my Husband! 

For 2026 or later, we might look into having kids. For now this isn’t on our planning yet!

# 1. Living Room: Comfort Meets Style

The living room is the heart of your home, where style and functionality must blend seamlessly. Choose sofas, armchairs, and coffee tables that align with your lifestyle and complement your home's aesthetic. Neutral tones can create a calm ambiance, while bold pieces act as focal points.

**Tips:**

* Opt for modular sofas if you entertain frequently.
* Add accent chairs or a statement coffee table from a trusted [home interior stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) to enhance the decor.

# 2. Dining Room: Create a Space for Memorable Meals

Your dining room should feel inviting yet practical. Choose a dining table and chairs that fit the space while leaving enough room for movement. Materials like wood or glass can match different styles, from rustic to contemporary.

**Pro Tip:** For a warm and natural look, consider incorporating rattan furniture in the UAE, which works beautifully in both casual and formal dining settings.

# 3. Bedroom: A Personal Sanctuary

The bedroom should be a cozy retreat. Start with a bed that anchors the space, and complement it with bedside tables, a wardrobe, and a dresser. Keep the design cohesive with soft, neutral tones or add personality with bold upholstery and decorative pieces.

**Expert Insight:** Explore a home decor furniture store for stylish storage solutions that keep clutter at bay while enhancing the room's design.

# 4. Home Office: Boost Productivity with Smart Choices

With more people working from home, a functional home office is essential. Invest in an ergonomic chair and a desk that fits the space without overwhelming it. Add bookshelves or cabinets for organized storage.

**Design Tip:** For smaller spaces, visit a home interior store to find multifunctional furniture like desks with built-in storage or wall-mounted shelving.

# 5. Outdoor Spaces: Transform with Garden Furniture

Outdoor spaces are an extension of your home and deserve the same level of attention. Comfortable and durable garden furniture can turn your patio, balcony, or garden into a relaxing haven.

**Style Advice:**

* Look for weather-resistant materials like teak, aluminum, or rattan furniture in the UAE for a tropical vibe.
* Visit a specialized [garden furniture store](https://beta.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) to explore a variety of outdoor seating, dining sets, and loungers.

**Pro Tip:** Incorporate colorful pieces or themed furniture from a home decor furniture store to make the space engaging for children.

# Essential Considerations When Choosing Furniture

1. **Room Size:** Always measure the available space before purchasing furniture to ensure it fits comfortably.
2. **Functionality:** Look for furniture that meets your practical needs without compromising on style.
3. **Material:** Choose durable materials that align with the room’s purpose—soft fabrics for bedrooms, sturdy wood or metal for living and dining areas, and weather-resistant materials for outdoor furniture.
4. **Style:** Maintain a consistent style throughout your home, whether it’s modern, rustic, or bohemian.

1hysemz,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1hysemz/trip_report_são_paulo_a_misunderstood_city/,Trip report: São Paulo - A misunderstood city?!,"**Context:** São Paulo was the last destination in a three-month trip around South America before flying back to the UK for Christmas at the tail end of 2024. I'm a 34-year-old male Product Designer from the UK and have been working remotely and on the move for the last four years.

*(Cities visited on this expedition:* [***Bogotá***,](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1gdbj25/a_summary_of_month_of_working_remotely_in_bogot%C3%A1/) *Medellín,* [***Lima***](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1gmqqwp/trip_report_and_strong_recommendation_lima/)*,* [***Santiago***](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1gz32hk/trip_report_santiago_chile_unfortunately_a_no/)*,* [***Buenos Aires***](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1h9qrtd/trip_report_another_buenos_aires_writeup/)*,* [***Rio***](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1hvmocb/trip_report_rio_what_a_city/)*)*

**Verdict:** I only spent a week there - but it's somewhere I'd strongly consider heading back to for a longer stint at some point over the next 12 months. If you love big cities (I do), there's more than enough for a great 1-month working stay.

\--

It felt like *everything* I had heard and read about São Paulo before arriving was outright negative, with the criticisms centred around a few key points:

* That it's dangerous
* That it's boring
* That its culture revolves solely around work
* That it's visually uninspiring

**São Paulo was radically different from what I had envisaged.** I had an impression that walking around the city would be gravely irresponsible - that danger lurked around every corner and you'd be confined to Ubers in order to get anywhere safely.

I don't know where that impression originated from, but it was (thankfully) completely wrong.

When compared to other cities on the continent, it had a much greater walkable area than somewhere like Bogotá. Looking further afield, compared to places with a culture of (well-warranted) security paranoia such as Cape Town or Johannesburg, it felt like an *enormous* improvement.

[I spent the first day getting a feel for some of the most popular neighbourhoods you may consider staying in: Vila Madalena, Pinheiros and Jardins Paulista. All these areas and the arterial roads connecting them had a good amount of footfall over the weekend. Frankly, the biggest issue you're likely to encounter is the steep gradients of the roads connecting many of the areas.](https://preview.redd.it/e7deyy5zxbce1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d68dd3052cd5d0c3779e39cb9a8fb6c9aa1b4e38)

I should stress that my experience isn't representative of the whole city. However, in the more modern and affluent areas, which you're likely to frequent as a visiting remote worker, I didn't feel any unease in the slightest. This was reflected by high footfall on the streets during the day and early evening, with people of all ages walking, running and cycling alone at weekends.

**Important context: critiques of the city are often levelled with its boisterous, beautiful, riveting neighbouring city of Rio in mind.** If you read my [previous post on Rio](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1hvmocb/trip_report_rio_what_a_city/), you'll know I was a big fan of the city, albeit perhaps not as a long-term destination for remote work.

When making a direct comparison to one of the world's most exuberant cities, São Paulo is going to fall flat every time for conventional tourism. And there's certainly an element of truth to these claims.

Yes, it is dramatically less visually inspiring. There are no white sand beaches set against tropical mountains. You won't see people practicing volleyball at 6:30 AM next to others still out from the night before. As South America's largest city and a global hub of commerce and finance, it naturally has a work focus.

But if you're here to work, then for me, these are net positives and contributed to me actually enjoying my time more, feeling more in the natural cadence and rhythm of the city.

# ✅ Positives 

**A real big-city feel.** The 24/7 bars and restaurants, imposing skyscrapers, wide roads and multicultural population all give it the feel of a serious global city, with Buenos Aires being the nearest comparable urban experience I found on the continent. Rio has touches of it in the Centro district, but it's segregated from the more leisure-oriented areas, whereas in São Paulo you find more of a typical city-like ambience with commercial and residential areas blending more naturally. In terms of demographics, it feels truly cosmopolitan with several sizeable foreign populations - most notably the largest Japanese diaspora outside of Japan.

**Great value**. While it's difficult to speak universally about value, if you're earning in USD/EUR/GBP, you'll struggle to find a global metropolis that matches São Paulo's value outside of Southeast Asia. Both accommodation and dining out offer dramatically better value than Europe and North America, without any noticeable drop in quality. However, like anywhere, bills can quickly mount up at higher-end establishments.

**A solid base to explore from.** With two airports serving both Brazil's and South America's largest city, you've got an excellent selection of connections to other cities in southern Brazil and internationally if you're planning to make it a base for an extended South American trip. For European travellers, flights to Guarulhos are among the cheapest to the continent via LATAM, TAP Air or BA.

**Accessible green spaces both within and outside the city's perimeter.** For a city often criticised for its density of buildings and concrete, it's greener than portrayed. Within an hour from the centre, you can reach the expansive [**Parque Estadual da Cantareira**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6GR6n1GENAt3ZqLz5), complementing numerous inner-city options. I enjoyed running along the [**Pinheiros River Cycle Path**](https://www.strava.com/activities/13120907438/overview?utm_medium=web_embed&utm_source=activity_embed&strava_deeplink_url=strava%3A%2F%2Factivities%2F13120907438&_branch_match_id=1227197644571631378&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3WOyw6CMBBFv6YseZUomhBjNKzcum7aMkgDpTgtEDd%2Bu0WIO5PZ3Dm5j8a5wR6jyDrkEw%2F5MISd6ttI3hS%2F85zapziRNKt51wkuWzZiVzSLh9AzSUt%2Fm1Ma7QWXTk3KKbBeJDRJ40O8z2julZkAJwUzoeXoNNNQqVETep1BMNACKpLuFmDNiBI82LJeKw3WHlYBDMvC75L195vyrz14I9SAqPoHE2hmC1hcGjQaPlWN9er%2FAAAA) & [**Parque Villa-Lobos**](https://www.strava.com/activities/13137699500/overview?utm_medium=web_embed&utm_source=activity_embed&strava_deeplink_url=strava%3A%2F%2Factivities%2F13137699500&_branch_match_id=1227197644571631378&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3WOyw6CMBBFv6Ys5VFFMSHGaFi5dd20ZZAGSnFaIG78dosQdyazuXNyH7VzvT2GoXXIR77hfb9pVdeE8qb4nR%2BofYoTSbYVb1vBZcMGbPN69hB6Jknhb3VKo73g0qlROQXWi5jGdJ9m2S6KvDIj4KhgIrQYnGYaSjVoQq8TCAZaQEmSdAbWDCjBgzXrtdBg6WElQD8v%2FC5Zfr8p%2F9qDN0IFiKp7MIFmsoD5pUaj4QOqBKc7%2FwAAAA%3D%3D), as well as walking in the evening through [**Parque Ibirapuera**](https://www.strava.com/activities/13124093716/overview?utm_medium=web_embed&utm_source=activity_embed&strava_deeplink_url=strava%3A%2F%2Factivities%2F13124093716&_branch_match_id=1227197644571631378&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3WOyw6CMBBFv6YsQSjBR2KM0bBy67ppyyANLcVpgbjx2y1C3JnM5s7JfTTe9%2B6QJM4jH3nM%2Bz7WqmsTeVP8znfUPcWJZHnNtRZctmxAfWxmD6FnkpXhVqe0JgguvRqVV%2BCCSGma5Zs93aZFUHYEHBVMhJaDN8xApQZD6HUCwcAIqEhWzMDZASUEsGa9FhotPawC6OeF3yXL7zflX3v0RqgBUXUPJtBODvB4adAa%2BACZXCJ6%2FwAAAA%3D%3D).

**An enviable selection of coworking spaces**. Undoubtedly the best city on the continent for WeWork members, with an unrivalled selection and quality of options spread across São Paulo. The number of quality independent operators far exceeds Rio and most other neighbouring cities I visited.

[Avenida Paulista serves as the central hub of modern São Paulo, stretching for nearly two kilometres and home to numerous retail and office outlets. Walking along it feels safe both during the day and into the early evening past sunset, with steady foot traffic and a visible police presence throughout.](https://preview.redd.it/wruzrdnyzbce1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d441f9bf2eae60594c9fc8c4e56d1ea5ef27f42c)

[A view looking east from the balcony of the WeWork in Vila Madalena. For a city often likened to the dystopian urban sprawl of Gotham, São Paulo is far from a grey concrete metropolis and features a number of remarkably leafy corridors.](https://preview.redd.it/mxpji4z10cce1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5423eadbd96b4e47fccdabb5be7956d62a4a567f)

# ❌ Negatives

**Not as 'Brazilian' as you may expect or hope for.** If you're only making one stop in Brazil, you might be underwhelmed by São Paulo in isolation, as it bears little resemblance to Rio's specific *Carioca* culture - what the world typically recognises as Brazilian. While I loved it as a place to work, if you're looking for a pure leisure destination, a couple of days may suffice before heading somewhere more compelling.

**An inconvenient metro system.** Compared to Rio where you can tap in with a contactless card, São Paulo's metro requires a specific travel card. Paper tickets are available, but they wouldn't accept my UK debit card, and I hadn't withdrawn any cash. While the metro is expansive and well-maintained, it's not particularly accessible for first-time visitors.

**Plenty of wet days.** Contrary to expectations, rain and clouds are just as much a part of life here as in the UK. If you're from the Northern Hemisphere and planning a winter escape, you may be disappointed with the weather during these months. From October to March, expect over 15 wet days per month, with January being the wettest at around 25 days. For those seeking long days of uninterrupted sunshine, consider looking elsewhere. During the drier, optimal months around September, expect early sunsets around 18:00. Mid-December brought with it both pockets of almost uncomfortable sunshine and heavy downpours, with the default appearing to be moderate cloud cover and mild temperatures around the clock.

**Studio flats are more prevalent than one-bedroom apartments.** For a month's stay, I'd generally prefer a one-bedroom to a studio. However, these were generally harder to find on Airbnb and usually commanded a premium. That said, the studios typically appeared larger than their European counterparts and usually feature proper beds rather than sofa beds.

# 🛏️ Accommodation & where to stay

Given its sheer scale and often unfavourable reputation for safety, working out where to stay in São Paulo can feel intimidating. However, what you'll find on arrival is a choice of well-connected, leafy neighbourhoods, all with an abundance of modern apartment buildings.

Compared to Rio, São Paulo offers a far better supply of well-located and high-spec Airbnbs, thanks to more modern building stock and being less affected by seasonal tourism pressures.

For around £800 per month, you should be able to find a quality modern apartment on Airbnb, with studio options being far more abundant than one-bedroom units, which command more of a premium.

I stayed in the [**Smart Vila condo complex**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QEFLBNMEG2xkiEWg8), which proved an excellent base and one I would happily return to. It featured one of the best on-site gyms I'd seen in South America, along with an on-site mini-mart, swimming pool and plentiful laundry machines, just a three-minute walk from the Vila Madalena metro station.

I won't claim to be an expert after just seven days and covering a small footprint of the city, but the following areas were repeatedly referenced in my research and are widely considered safe bets where you'll likely spend the bulk of your time:

✅ **Vila Madalena** 

So tranquil you'd never guess you're in a city of over 12 million people. Set among hills, the area blends residential streets with neighbourhood cafes and bars, plus two WeWorks. If you're seeking a safe, calm area with a touch of understated hipster charm, look no further. An ideal choice for anyone feeling apprehensive about visiting São Paulo. However, if you want to feel the city's energy, you might want to look elsewhere.

✅ **Pinheiros** 

Immediately south of Vila Madalena, Pinheiros is known for its artistic and bohemian character. On Google Maps, you'll see it covers a vast area. Compared to Vila Madalena, it has a busier and slightly grittier feel, though still very comfortable to explore on foot. Would happily consider an Airbnb here, particularly near Fradique Coutinho metro station with its abundance of coffee shops and restaurants. The streets immediately north of Oscar Freire metro station also had a great atmosphere and may feel better-suited for longer stays.

✅ **Jardins** 

The 'Jardins' area covers an extensive expanse immediately downhill from Avenida Paulista and below Av. Rebouças. Known as one of the most upscale areas in the city. I'd recommend staying immediately south of Consolação in Jardim Paulista, where you'll find a good mix of restaurants and retail. Further south towards Jardim Paulistano & Europa, it becomes more residential. While I'd happily stay anywhere in this area, I'd probably opt for the two mentioned above.

✅ **Itaim Bibi** 

Close to both Parque Ibirapuera & Parque do Povo, this upscale area has more of a slant towards high-end restaurants, hotels, boutique fitness studios and refined cocktail options. A great choice if you're after a more sophisticated stay and happy to spend more. Numerous WeWork sites within a five-minute walk. Could be ideal for a few nights in a hotel.

❌ **Historical Centre**

Like most South American cities, São Paulo's historical centre requires caution. With fewer modern amenities and heightened security concerns compared to other neighbourhoods, take care when visiting during daylight hours.

[The area surrounding Vila Madalena is a constantly undulating landscape of steep hills, with climbs and descents around every corner. If you are looking for anywhere flatter for running, head towards the riverside where the Ciclofaixa path is a reliable alternative.](https://preview.redd.it/cvuyjym40cce1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bafa848d0c7c8abd27fce4ca7fd1d5f9df51d304)

# 💻 Where to Work

Along with Tokyo and London, São Paulo stands as one of the best cities globally for WeWork access. There are 15 locations spread across the city's most desirable neighbourhoods, and the quality was the highest I found in South America.

Most locations featured outdoor terraces, were spacious and had dedicated areas for All Access members with some of the most professional atmospheres I encountered. I spent most of the week in the [**R. Purpurina, 400**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/izEB89DdZXvqyc9m9) site at Vila Madalena - it was the most tranquil WeWork I've ever visited.

There was no music, no overly chatty staff at the community bar, no 11 AM sound of table tennis rattling your eardrums. Most desks were occupied by individual independent workers, making it a professional and quiet space to get work done.

A small caveat: it was close to Christmas, so likely quieter than usual.

I spent a day at two other sites, though I wouldn't necessarily prioritise being near either:

[**Avenida Paulista**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QUP2iCTD8cLEK1yPA) \- Perfect location in what feels like the city centre. However, the All Access seating appears to be claimed by groups of office workers early in the morning, making it feel more like someone's private office than a quiet workspace.

[**R. Butantã, 194**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cpPNsj2jNbQzYoYv6) \- Large open-plan space for All Access members on the fifth floor. While it's a decent building with plenty of seats, the immediate neighbourhood isn't somewhere I'd choose to base myself long-term.

Aside from WeWork, numerous independent operators like [**Eureka**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/baiqvmHwdU9ws4r4A) and [**Central9**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7pb2qZFa3HgyHsoB7) are dotted across the city and open 24/7, meaning whichever neighbourhood you choose, you should have a decent selection at your disposal.

# ☕️ Food & Drink

[**Riviera Bar** ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8HN495rVYh4k9YuD9)

A stylish cocktail bar, open 24 hours a day, located at the top of Avenida Paulista. Really well-designed interior with quality drinks. Would make an ideal date spot. My colleague recommended booking a table in advance if intending to dine as there was a queue to enter.

[**Coffee Lab** ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CF95ubZHBiZahtYT8)

They have two sites, but I'd recommend the one in Vila Madalena. Some of the best coffee I sampled during my three months on the continent. They sell 400g airtight containers of their espresso blend at very competitive prices.

[**Casa Jardim** ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zD2rEgcc7iYiH624A)

Lunch buffets are highly popular among office workers in Brazil, and this was the best one I visited. Set in a beautiful house, there's an enormous range of fresh salads and grilled meats, with a plate costing around 35 reais. Definitely worth a visit if working in the area.

[Lunch buffets are popular options for office workers during the work week, typically featuring a wide array of local salads, grilled meats, rice dishes and, inevitably, beans.](https://preview.redd.it/hpzyibr70cce1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e4b2661bc439c4c7e3a7b08e24f2bcd2ebacebe)

[Like anywhere in Brazil, if you are looking for a quick, tasty and inexpensive meal, look out for one of the thousands of lanchonetes that can be found all across the city. Searching for 'Snack Bars' will give you good results on Google Maps. Expect to pay under £5 for a large meal of protein, rice and beans, with large bottles of ice-cold beer served for under £2.](https://preview.redd.it/mx6n328a0cce1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e30545470ed4ce264dc226cd69c5ab77f8e63bf)

# 📋 Tips

**Areas of the city can be super hilly.** If you are in any way physically impaired, or simply hate climbing steep hills, you may want to research in advance to avoid severe gradients. Any 10-minute walk around Vila Madalena will inevitably include some particularly taxing climbs and descents.

**For most transactions in Brazil, you'll be asked whether your card is Debit or Credit.** This can be confusing as while I always used a UK Monzo debit card, it would generally only work when selecting the Credit option. Try both options if your payment isn't going through.

**Tipping in Brazil is straightforward.** A 10% service charge is typically added to your bill automatically when dining in. Not carrying physical cash for tipping purposes didn't feel problematic.

**If travelling domestically, aim to depart from Congonhas, the domestic airport closer to the city centre.** The drive to GRU (the larger international airport) can be lengthy and is often susceptible to heavy traffic. An Uber to GRU in the middle of the day cost around 100 reais (£13) and took about an hour. Congonhas's central location makes it much more convenient for domestic travel.

**An eSIM from Saily offered reasonable value for money.** 15GB of data cost around £18 and was better value than the Airalo equivalent.",2,1736587851.0,digitalnomad,0,1.0,False

I've tried various brands and types.

This is just my experience I want to tell. It could be a warning for some, could be just a story for others.

I' found that certain CBD capsules give you a decent (albeit discreet) head and body buzz. As some brands are full spectrum - has all cannabinoids except THC (tho is still in small amounts) . This is UK btw

Marketers say ""CBD isn't psychoactive""....maybe not just cbd......but some types of caps with full spec...absolutely are low level psychoactive. I wouldn't drive on it for sure as I'm a bit impaired for sure, red, stoned feeling eyes at high dose.  

My absolute bastard addict in me, found two brands - I won't tell which - big name ones, legit - but they hit way better than others. And look at me then.... I'm sneaking double hits of strong CBD tablets to get a low level buzz every afternoon. Week in week out.

One of these brands is advertised by a famous ""ex"" addict as a way to balance him out....BS.... I'm sure he discovered the same thing. Haven't checked in a while to see if he's still sober as it's out my algorithm now, but for me it's a v slippery slow slope. honestly it's just a less damaging other dpenedency.... Maybe that's good I dunno ?

But I know I'm a real addict when I take it each and every day and I'm feinding....for CBD. Obviously it's not the actual CBD, it's the dopamine hit really....the love of the chase of the high.... Also it's almost certainly the chase of the chill/the distraction from my own sober thoughts.....But I do like the buzz too.... But it's pretty weak and I know it

Fast forward a few months and I'm in shape.... Well rested....eating well...cos I quit the other substances ...... BUT I'm also dependent on CBD tabs....ordering more and getting pick up at the post office instead of delivery so my wife doesn't know how much I'm using (LOL) ....addict behaviour alert!!!!! 

Then after some time, often a long time, it's a very easy step up to real weed here and there I get a toke from someone or an edible at a party.... Then I want some of my own cos the CBD doesn't cut it mow....so I call my friend and get some hash cos it doesn't smell as bad in the house so no one knows I have it. 

I put it in a hot tea/coffee for 10 mins before drinking to decarb it.....not the most efficient way of turning thca to THC, but it works...and more importantly no one knows.

then I might sneak an odd toke here and there in the garden.....oops, silly me! .....I realise that's gona get me busted cos of the smell and big high off the bat....so instead while everyone is out one day, I decarb a load of hash and cook up a ton of coconut hash oil...... I'll calculate the approx mg/gram.... I'm high off my mind on dopamine at this point cos Ive done this shit since I was 17....41 now..... then I start low dose .... Say 5mg THC a day, then ill have a sneaky 2.5 mg in my morning espresso....very soon I'm high all day, every day.

Pretty soon I'm bored of just being high, (whut?!) so I get some NABeers to add some nice flavour.... To trick me I'm drunk almost ...yknow high and beer taste.... ""Oh no, this isn't a problem dude, don't worry, you're totally fine"" (lol)..... then a few weeks later I have a sneaky Moretti bottle at the pub instead of NA beer....then soon i'm drunk and high all the time for 6 months.....all the weight is back on, my fitness is through the floor, till my health suffers, I get weird symptoms of some sort, enter a hypochondriac cycle somewhat and drink more to cover my shitty feeling..... and i start the cycle all over again. Massive anxiety, starting sobriety again, fears, hypochondria, starting exercise all over again, losing weight.... Build the confidence and then think....hmmm CBD sounds like a good way to sleep more!!!!!

Same shit with micrososing mushrooms. I did that for about a year. I grew three ozs and I took 0.15 -0.25 g almost every day to keep that low level buzz going in ""sobriety'. I saw zero health benefits that people talk about.... Absolute bs in my mind.... At least for me. 

I guess these things are a lesser of evils, I'm not killing myself with booze half the year .... but it's still addictive (for me) and it's a gateway to kill myself with booze the other half of the year 

I have a lot of shame publicly about stuff and would never go raging public addict....and I don't immediately go mad cos I want to keep up appearances.... 

But I'm a slow burning time bomb man. Always have been, always will be.

For me, medication fixed everything basically.

I’m from Germany and the golden rule here is no iodine at all, but I see studies and reports from Asia where some say it’s beneficial, others stay neutral.

My antibodies before meds were 55, antibodies now are low 30s, no goiters but the typical holey tissue.

I had this question forwarded to my endo, he is only in tuesdays and it might take a while beyond that until he answers me since im waiting for my full hormone test results.

I really like Korean food, I eat it all the time and wrapping the seaweed with rice and meat and veggies is super tasty, but I’m worried that it might not be good or allowed.

What’s your take on roasted seaweed snacks?

And if you are pro or neutral seaweed - how much? 

On the bibigo packages it usually doesn’t state how much iodine is in there, but for reference one serving is like 4g


Little info about my diet and lifestyle:

I exercise a lot, like 15k steps and after I get used to that I’ll do some Pilates plus the walking

I eat very balanced. I eat whole grains, but also white bread and rice (the bread is from a bakery and it’s very easy on my stomach)

I also eat dairy, about 200ml of milk, 100g yogurt sometimes more sometimes less 

Sometimes I eat silken tofu 
I eat processed meats for breakfast sometimes but it’s like ham so barely 

I eat a lot  of meat in general, all types. I eat a lot of eggs, like 3-4 a day at least.

I also eat a lot of fruit, all types.
Lot of vegetables again all types.
Nightshades too.
Not a coffee drinker but I do drink diet soda sometimes or black tea.
I do eat candy every day, like one bar of milka for example.

I’m doing very well with all this physically and mentally. 
My metabolism is good and working. 

I notice very small changes in my thyroid and body and I really don’t have issues with this.

","After a hectic day, it’s essential to find moments of peace and relaxation. Mindfulness exercises can help you let go of stress, center your thoughts, and reconnect with the present. Here are some easy practices to help you unwind:

# 1. Deep Breathing Exercise

* Sit or lie down in a quiet space.
* Inhale deeply through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, and exhale slowly through your mouth for 6 counts.
* Repeat for 5–10 minutes to calm your nervous system and reduce tension.

# 2. Body Scan Meditation

* Close your eyes and focus on your breathing.
* Starting at your head, mentally “scan” each part of your body, noticing sensations or tension.
* As you identify areas of tightness, imagine the tension melting away.

# 3. 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique

If your mind is racing, try this simple grounding exercise:

* Identify **5 things** you can see.
* Notice **4 things** you can touch.
* Acknowledge **3 things** you can hear.
* Recognize **2 things** you can smell.
* Focus on **1 thing** you can taste. This practice helps bring your attention to the present moment.

# 4. Gratitude Journaling

* Write down three things you’re grateful for today.
* Reflect on why these moments or experiences mattered to you.
* This exercise shifts your focus from stress to positivity and appreciation.

# 5. Progressive Muscle Relaxation

* Lie down in a comfortable position.
* Start by tensing your toes for 5 seconds, then release.
* Gradually move up your body, tensing and relaxing each muscle group.
* This practice eases physical and mental tension.

# 6. Mindful Tea or Coffee Ritual

* Prepare a cup of tea or coffee and savor the process.
* Focus on the aroma, warmth, and taste with each sip.
* Let this simple ritual become a meditative moment of calm.

# 7. Visualization Exercise

* Close your eyes and imagine a peaceful place, such as a beach, forest, or cozy cabin.
* Picture yourself there, paying attention to the sights, sounds, and sensations.
* Spend 5–10 minutes in this mental escape.

# 8. Evening Walk in Nature

* Take a stroll outside and focus on the rhythm of your steps and your breathing.
* Notice the colors of the sky, the rustle of leaves, or the sound of birds.
* Walking mindfully helps clear your mind and reconnect with your surroundings.

# 9. One-Minute Breathing Exercise

* For one minute, focus solely on your breath.
* Inhale deeply, exhale slowly, and count each breath.
* This quick exercise is perfect for transitioning from work mode to relaxation mode.

# 10. Mindful Stretching

* Perform gentle stretches, such as touching your toes or rolling your shoulders.
* Pay attention to how your body feels with each movement.
* Stretching helps release built-up tension and improves relaxation.

# Unwind Your Way

Incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine doesn’t have to be complicated. Start with just one or two exercises that resonate with you, and notice how they transform your evenings into peaceful, restorative moments.

1hyrs8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/uknews/comments/1hyrs8t/two_supermarkets_still_cheaper_than_aldi_and_lidl/,Two supermarkets still cheaper than Aldi and Lidl for basket of food essentials despite price hikes,"[https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/two-supermarkets-still-cheaper-aldi-30752778](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/two-supermarkets-still-cheaper-aldi-30752778)

Two supermarkets previously slated over 'shocking' food prices are working out cheaper than Aldi and Lidl for a basket of essentials for a second week.

[We reported last week how both Morrisons and Asda were cheaper than the budget retailers](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/two-supermarkets-now-cheaper-aldi-30702684.amp) for the shop of staple items, including bread, milk, butter, beans, tea bags, coffee, mince and chicken breasts.

And now, despite price rises at both places, they remain cheapest, with Morrisons' bill at £12.34 and Asda's at £12.51.

It comes despite Morrisons increasing the price of its cheapest Savers tea bags from 80p a pack to 90p and Asda putting its mince up slightly from £2.49 to £2.51.

They're not the only ones to put prices up this week either.

Sainsbury's and [Tesco](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/tesco) have both put up the price of their chicken breasts, with their respective £2.44 and £2.45 prices for 300g, now the most expensive of the lot. At Lidl and Aldi, the 300g pack costs £2.25, while at Morrisons, it's down even further thanks to its current More Card offer

They're both also the most expensive for a pack of mince, with Sainsbury's charging £2.70 and Tesco only slightly decreasing its price this week from £2.70 to £2.69.

With its overall bill of £13.23, Tesco is most expensive for a fifth consecutive week and charging more than 7% more than Morrisons, which has recently [expanded its Aldi and Lidl Price Match scheme to include more than 500 products](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/supermarket-cheaper-aldi-lidl-basket-30732358.amp).

Our price comparison has monitored the cost of the same eight basic items since March 2022 and it's mostly been either Aldi or Lidl coming in cheapest throughout that time.

Aldi has always argued that our comparison doesn't take into account the difference in quality, insisting that its own Diplomat Red Label tea bags and its coffee are 'higher quality' than the comparative products used and its tins of beans are heavier than some of the others.

When it comes to meat however, our comparison includes the cheapest packs of mince from each place and at Aldi and Lidl, along with Morrisons, it's a 25% fat pack, whereas the others sell 20% fat, which is seen as better quality.

An Aldi spokesperson said: ""Our promise to customers is that they will make significant savings every time they shop with Aldi, which is why we’ve been named Which? Cheapest Supermarket of the Year for three years running. Which? has also named Aldi the UK’s Cheapest Supermarket every month in 2024.”

[Asda](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/asda) also disagrees with our comparison and says that our small sample of products does not represent the fuller picture of prices and does not account for its deals. The supermarket says that, across the board, its Just Essentials range is the largest and cheapest available, alongside Aldi's.

Many of you will remember the Armenian Flamingo Crab fiasco of March 2023... but I'm just some little chap sitting in a dark room doing this primarily for free. If you paid me, I'd definitely up my game. (BUY A BLOODY BOOK!)

[A pleasant café](https://preview.redd.it/a6zimrnwsbce1.png?width=1315&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ef79d44cf27ff70b41fc865930be01cb459860b)

The paid-for publications are supposed to be far more revelatory and respectable.

Therefore, consider me somewhat surprised to see our local newspaper produce an article about café etiquette. Not just any café etiquette, but the specifics of 'reserving' a seat.

So... I'm going to stoop. Again.

If a paid-for newspaper is going to posit that this is newsworthy, then - by Geronimo's sacred pucker - I'm going to damn well pick it up and run with it, like I'd just stolen it (which I have) and am being chased by all of the nefarious little weevils that work there.

So let's consider this scenario...

You visit a fairly busy café, and want to purchase their famous lentil flavoured couscous. And a gluten-free turmeric muffin. And some organic free-range decaf elderberry coffee.

As you're ordering, you see a vacant table, and tell the server ""I'll be over there"", and off you go, waving your hemp haberdashery around like a tie-dyed, barefoot, wild-eyed child of the forest.

When you get there, some bespectacled old scabbard has plonked her snow-leopard-skin dog-bag - and dog - there, and is currently up at the counter ordering her panda-meat curry, with a side of kitten gibblets.

So my question is this... is it acceptable to 'reserve' a table like this before you have ordered, or should you order, and take your chances like everyone else?

Let's mix it up a bit... if I arrive at said café with my incredibly vivacious young wife, who has the mien of a goddess, and total editorial control, is it acceptable for her to go find a seat while I am ordering her rare steak, and my gruel? Or must she wait with me in the line?

The article in the newspaper suggested she must wait with me.

I tend to like guys my own age. Not 18 and not 50. (EDIT i live in Central Scotland, a few large towns in my area and city nearby).

I am on the main ""dating"" apps and it's truly terrible for a persons mental health. I am not perfect but it's bad out there.

Pretty much nobody talks on Tinder even if he matched 30 seconds ago? I have had a few decent chats over last year but they never want to meet? I had a fab chat over about a week with one guy over New Year. He always had an excuse, though. The only one that went all the way was in Summer and was basically him wanting sex.

Grindr ... I just can't meet anybody! Maybe I overthink things looking for red flags but half the profiles are blank and even if asked wont show faces. The main thing is nobody will tell me what they want, ""anything"", ""not too sure"". I'm down, but do you want to bottom or just jerk off? If we get through all that, it turns out they don't know when they are free. It just dies there. I thought we were all having sex with each other!?!

Hinge is hopeless. Some cute guys at first but now they all seem to be 100 miles away. Couldn't bring myself to use any other apps.

They hadn’t changed—still warm, still mesmerizing, still undoing me with a glance.

“I’m glad we can still talk like this,” you said, smiling.

I nodded, feigning ease. “Yeah, me too.”

But I wasn’t glad. I wasn’t fine. Every second in your presence felt like an unraveling. I told myself I’d moved on, that I was stronger now. Yet here I was, drowning in those irises like I had a thousand times before.

You looked away for a moment, watching the rain streak the window. I took the chance to breathe.

“Are you okay?” you asked, catching me off guard.

I wanted to lie, but the words slipped out before I could stop them. “I hate how I always fall for your beautiful eyes.”

Your brow furrowed, a flicker of something unreadable crossing your face. “You always said that. Even back then.”

“And back then, I always meant it,” I admitted, my voice quieter than the patter of the rain.

You didn’t respond, but your gaze lingered on me a little too long. For a moment, I wondered if I still had some small claim on your heart. But then the server came with the check, and the spell broke.

As you stood to leave, I stayed seated, clutching my coffee cup like it was the only thing tethering me to reality. You smiled one last time before walking out, leaving me with nothing but the echo of my confession and the weight of your beautiful eyes burned into my memory.

1hyrdr6,https://i.redd.it/lsaedi9epbce1.jpeg,What's a single question you think everyone should ask themselves daily? • [Click to Expand],"## A Daily Check-In for a More Intentional Life


Let’s dive into something simple yet profound—something that could potentially change the way you navigate your life. Imagine if every single day, you paused for a moment and asked yourself a single question. One that doesn’t just scratch the surface of your to-do list but dives deep into the core of who you are, your priorities, and your purpose.  

Now, you’re probably wondering, “What’s the question?” Well, we’ll get there. But first, let’s unpack why asking questions matters.  

### The Power of Questions  

Questions shape our thoughts. They force us to confront the parts of our lives we often ignore. Think about it: When was the last time you asked yourself something truly meaningful? Not “What’s for dinner?” or “Where are my keys?” but something that nudged at the edges of your comfort zone?  

The right question has the power to shift your perspective. It can pull you out of autopilot and make you pause long enough to consider what truly matters. For me, this realization hit hard a few years ago. I was going through the motions—work, eat, sleep, repeat—and I felt stuck. I couldn’t pinpoint why I was so restless until one day, someone asked me, “What’s one thing you did today that made you proud?”  

I didn’t have an answer.  

That question stayed with me, lingering like a stubborn melody. It wasn’t just a query; it was a wake-up call. I began to ask myself that same question every night. Slowly, I realized how much I was coasting through life without any real intention.  

### Choosing Your Daily Question  

So, what’s the one question you should ask yourself every day? Well, it depends on what you need most. For some, it might be, “What am I grateful for today?” Gratitude is a powerful antidote to negativity. Taking a moment to acknowledge the good—whether it’s a kind word from a friend or simply the fact that the sun came up again—can shift your focus away from what’s lacking.  

For others, the question could be, “Am I being true to myself?” This one is tricky because it requires brutal honesty. Are you living a life that aligns with your values, or are you just trying to meet someone else’s expectations?  

One of my friends, Sarah, swears by asking herself, “Did I act with kindness today?” She told me how this simple habit transformed her relationships. By focusing on kindness, she became more patient, more empathetic, and less reactive.  

The beauty of this exercise is its flexibility. You can tailor the question to suit your current priorities. Maybe you’re chasing a dream, and your daily question becomes, “What’s one small step I can take today to get closer to my goal?” Or maybe you’re in a season of healing, and your question is, “Did I take care of myself today?”  

### Why One Question Matters  

Now, you might wonder: Why limit it to just one question? Here’s the thing—life is already overwhelming. Between work, family, and endless notifications, the last thing you need is another complex routine. But one question? That’s doable.  

One question cuts through the noise. It’s simple, direct, and easy to remember. More importantly, it sets the tone for your day (or reflects on your day, depending on when you ask it). It’s like a compass, helping you navigate the chaos with a bit more clarity.  

Let’s say your question is, “What’s one thing I’m looking forward to today?” This shifts your mindset immediately. Instead of dreading your responsibilities, you’re scanning your day for moments of joy. Maybe it’s a coffee date with a friend, a favorite TV show, or even just the chance to crawl into bed at the end of it all. That small act of anticipation can brighten your mood and give you something to hold onto.  

### The Ripple Effect  

When you start asking yourself the right question every day, something magical happens: it changes how you show up in the world. You become more intentional, more self-aware, and—here’s the kicker—more human.  

I remember a time when I was caught up in a cycle of negativity. Work was stressful, my relationships felt strained, and I wasn’t taking care of myself. Then I stumbled upon a podcast where the host suggested asking, “What’s one thing I can control today?”  

At first, it felt silly. But over time, it helped me shift my focus from the things I couldn’t change—like my boss’s bad mood or traffic—to the things I could, like my attitude or how I spent my breaks. Slowly but surely, I felt less overwhelmed.  

This ripple effect doesn’t stop with you. When you’re more grounded, you naturally influence the people around you. Your patience grows, your conversations deepen, and your relationships improve.  

### Practical Tips for Making It a Habit  

Alright, so you’re sold on the idea of asking yourself a daily question. But how do you make it stick? Here are a few tips:  

1. **Pick a Time**  
   Decide when you’ll ask your question. Morning works great if you want to set the tone for your day. Evening is better for reflection. Choose what feels natural.  

2. **Write It Down**  
   Put your question somewhere you’ll see it. A sticky note on your bathroom mirror, a reminder on your phone, or even a screensaver.  

3. **Keep It Simple**  
   Don’t overthink it. The goal is to make this a quick, consistent habit, not a chore.  

4. **Pair It with Another Habit**  
   Tie your question to something you already do, like brushing your teeth or making your morning coffee. This makes it easier to remember.  

### Expanding the Conversation  

Asking one question is just the start. Over time, you might find yourself asking follow-ups. For example, if your question is, “What am I grateful for today?” you might also ask, “How can I show my gratitude?” If your question is, “Did I take care of myself today?” you might add, “What could I do differently tomorrow?”  

The point is to stay curious. Life isn’t about having all the answers; it’s about asking better questions.  

### Closing Thoughts  

So, what’s your question going to be? Whatever it is, make it one that challenges you, inspires you, or simply grounds you in the moment. Because here’s the truth: The quality of your life is shaped by the quality of your thoughts. And the right question? That’s where it all begins.  

Take a moment. Reflect. What’s the one question you need to ask yourself today?
