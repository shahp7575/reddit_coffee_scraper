Hey folks,

Pretty new to the coffee scene and slowly finding my way to a good cup.

I’m planning to get a pour over set soon, but honestly, a grinder and weighing scale feel like a bit of a stretch budgetwise at the moment. So I thought I’d check in here..

If anyone around Mumbai is looking to upgrade or has a decent grinder or scale they’re not using anymore, I’d love to take it off your hands! Also open to any beginner tips

1ly9t5r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ly9t5r,Finished PB fast of 89hrs 😊 (spoiler; pic of food),"Just.. couldn't live with my body not being the size I expect my body to be anymore. In March I was ~178lbs (5'8"" 29yo intersex) but after some depression it creeped up to 195 and could see myself easily stumbling into over 200 if I kept up the binge-stress-eating, laying in bed, and overall not caring for my body.

I did a yearly 30hr famine (religious thing 🙄) as a teen so I always knew you dont just 'shut down and die' or whatever, but after reading up on fasting benefits I decided to jump into a 72hr fast (water, black coffee, tea, stevia-based electrolite drink) and surpassedit!! Happy to be back under the 190s at 183 (yes, I know some will come back) and will be moving into OMAD with the occasional 72hr water fast. I'm hoping to get in the ballpark of 160!

Right now I've just had a little miso soup, and 35min later a tofu scramble with nutritional yeast, onion, bell pepper, and honey-fermented garlic and it tastes so much better than it ever has and I felt ok to just have a small portion. During the fast I felt much better than I have lately- and on average better than I've felt in YEARS! I'm taking a break over the weekend and might do another 42-72 next week to prep for a photoshoot.

Excited to get going on this journey, and thank you for all your posts!! Very inspiring 😊✨️",1,1752350941.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

I want to decide ASAP whether to marry him or never speak to him again because time is precious.,"I’m 30, he’s 30, and I feel like I’m too old to keep entertaining situations that go nowhere.

I came to NYC last minute with my mom because she has an emergency errand. I hadn’t booked the train tix till last night. Just an hour ago I let him know I was nearby. He lives in Manhattan. He didn’t ask why I was in town, didn’t suggest meeting up, didn’t even acknowledge it in any real way. He said “oh you’re nearby.”No “wish I’d known” or “want to grab a quick coffee?” Nothing.

Meanwhile, he told me he was in Connecticut the day before for work, but I later found out he was visiting a pregnant female friend from grad school. I’m not mad about that specifically - it just highlighted how he’s not very upfront and doesn’t act like someone who’s transparent?

I’ve tried to cut things off before but never fully followed through. We’ve known each other since we were 10 and had classes together. I’m seriously questioning whether I should now. I don’t want to waste any more energy on someone who clearly isn’t prioritizing me.

The guitar spills through the speakers, heavy and unfiltered, coating the room like smoke. It doesn’t bother me, but it clutters the air—makes it harder to think clearly. I don’t recognize the song. It has no significance to me, just another set of sounds meant to evoke a feeling. Still, I understand the intent. People use music to heighten atmosphere, to connect emotionally, to dull the weight of their own thoughts. I watch it work on the others—shoulders sway, lips curl into vague smiles. My mind, meanwhile, shifts without warning. The alcohol makes that worse. It breaks the usual order of my thoughts, pushing one out before I’ve finished examining it, replacing it with another just as incomplete. I don’t enjoy that. I prefer control. I prefer silence
I need it
There’s no use lingering or pretending otherwise.
My hands press against the edge of the table, steadying me as I rise. Movements need to be precise—calculated. I’ve seen what happens when people underestimate their limits: slurred words, stumbling steps, embarrassment. I don’t allow myself that kind of vulnerability. Not in public.
I make my way to the front, pull out cash, and settle the bill without comment. Transactions are simple. Clean. I prefer them that way.
As I head for the exit, I concentrate on maintaining even steps. The alcohol hasn’t compromised me, but I won’t take chances. Every movement is deliberate—left, then right, pressure evenly distributed. The floor beneath me, once sharp in its detail, now blurs at the edges. The wood grain blends into itself, the texture indistinct. It doesn’t matter.
The door gives under my hand. Outside, the city swallows me whole. Streetlights and high-rise windows cast fragmented patterns across the pavement, fractured and cold. It’s dark, but not disorienting. The warmth in the air is misplaced—unnatural for this time of night—but I register it only as a data point. Not a comfort. Never a comfort.
Going outside seems to be the smart and easiest option to get some silence. It is what a person should do- remove themselves from situation rather than inflict it on others. i don’t think its enough though. If there was just a way to pull the plug in the noise all at once. So I could stop all the cars honking and groaning, the lights might go silent, and the obnoxiously loud speakers playing out of the open doors would just stop. 
I wish for silence. Yet even if it were delivered in full, I doubt I’d find it welcome. There’s an irony in wanting nothingness only to face the constant noise in my head when I force my eyes open. In that silence, my thoughts—they’re unrelenting, a private cacophony that offers no relief.
When I try to escape the external clamor, the ground beneath me seems to shift, undermining my control. In that disorienting moment, I find myself steering back to the familiar confines of home, where even the dogs, with their own animal rhythms, offer a form of predictable distraction.
My vision blurs. The familiar walls ripple, edges bending and twisting. The steady rhythm of breathing—mine, theirs—becomes a distorted echo.
Then I’m not home anymore.
I wake up drenched in sweat. The clock glares 4:15 a.m. The same uneasy fog clings to my mind. I groan, pushing myself upright, already bracing for the day ahead—even though I know I won’t have the energy to make it through.
I pull open my bedroom door and notice my dogs at my heels. They wear their own silly looking happy dog smile. It’s adorable. The back door slides open with ease, and the fresh, cool, damp, air fills my nose. I turn around, but leave the door open for the dogs. I turn on music to help the morning go by. 
I feel the tiles of my bathroom on my feet. Turning my body towards the mirror, I see myself. My face is tired- my eyes give it away. Unfortunate. I much prefer others not assume what I am feeling. If I want them to know I’ll tell them. I pull an ugly face in the mirror and turn away. A shower should wash away the details, as much as possible. I strip off the sweat stained clothes and toss them in a pile. 
I step in, and notice the water is cold just as every morning. It locks my body up for a moment… before the warmth comes. The body wash scrubs away the late night adventure with the help of my nails and a wash cloth. I don’t know most of what happened last night, I don’t know if I want to know either. 
I finish up the shower and decide I don’t. 
I choose a thin shirt, identical except for color, to all my other ones. Red today I suppose. A pair of dark jeans, even though they are scratchy.  I throw a sweater on aswell. I’m not much of a fan for decions, so keeping identical clothing takes away some of the day to day routine ones. I run a brush through my curly, shaggy hair. It kind of works—presentable enough for work.  I’m not one to take judgments anyways. 
The thought of work weighs on me, and I let it show in my shoulders. I don’t dislike the job of course- it’s  very righteous work-  it makes me feel human. Other times it makes me feel like I’m crazy, but I expect the lows when I get the highs. It doesn’t matter though, I do it because it’s right. Or what I assume is “right.”
I grab my dogs food bowls and fill them, I then make myself some food. I enjoy the feeling of hunger in a way, every living thing has hunger… so I am no different. Even still, survival is practical. So I eat. 
I grab my shoes and pat my pants to make sure I have my daily items. Phone, keys, wallet, pen. If I don’t have the items it annoys me. The dogs come inside at my call, and I close the back door. 
“Be good” I say it thrice, once to each dog, even though they don’t understand. It’s habit to talk to them, and it’s not a bad one. I scratch their heads each before leaving. 
The city of Los Angeles always smells terrible. If it were up to me, I’d never come here. It’s just an ugly city mostly. The last time I was here on a case; it went smoothly, but it was a smaller one. This new case seems to be interesting enough. I have a job to do either way, my preference aside. 
 I pull up to the precinct a bit earlier then needed, though I stopped for coffee. I put a smile on my face, even though it felt odd. I’m not really the optimist honestly but it made people talk to me more, and the more things I hear the easier it is to understand. 
The check in is fast, and I attach my clip labeling myself as a detective as I headed toward the office of the one and only Agent Marison. I knock on the door quickly before pushing it open.
“Hello again Agent Marison,  it’s good to see you” I shake her hand.
“You too detective. Though I’m saddened by the circumstances if you could imagine” her eyes agree that she is sad, and it seems as if she is tired. 
“Yes indeed, Ive heard a bit about it. How many?”
“So far two with the same MO, about 3 weeks apart”
With that she slides the photos over. 
In the first set, there is pictures of a family dead in the bed of the parents- two children and the mother and father. Blood is everywhere on the floor, holes and cuts lay on the walls like a foreign language that nobody but the author could understand. It’s a mess, and it is quite obvious how the killer did it. 
I close my eyes and let the images bleed into my thoughts, pulling the pieces together like I’ve done a many times before. If I were him...
The night drapes itself over the neighborhood like silk—quiet, still, untouched. It's the kind of place that carries itself like royalty, tucked far enough from the world to pretend it’s above the filth. A sanctuary with clean streets, trimmed hedges, and warm porch lights glowing like lighthouses of false security.
I don't bother hiding much. My face, sure—habit. But the rest? I don’t sweat it. Even if they saw me, even if they tried… they couldn’t catch me. Wouldn’t matter if they did.
I slip around to the side door, where shadows cling thick against the siding. My fingers work quickly—deft, sure, silent. The lock gives with a soft click, like opening a treasure chest. I step inside, each footfall nothing more than a breath across the hardwood. The only real sound is my knife, its edge skimming lazily along the walls. It hums a low, eager tune, like it knows where we're going.
Upstairs, I pass the children’s room. I don’t even glance inside. No thrill there.
The adults’ door is already cracked open, swinging slightly as if inviting me in. Daring me. I accept.
The man goes first—efficient and clean, a slice and a sigh. He doesn’t even get a word out. The woman’s harder, but not in any way that surprises me. She makes for the kids, of course. They always do. I laugh—sharp and quiet. Let her go. There’s no rush.
I go back to the man, returning to him like a craftsman to his work. Again and again, precise and deliberate, until the thrill begins to fade from my fingertips. I try to hold onto it, savor it, but satisfaction is a slippery thing.
Eventually, I follow the trail she left behind—her blood painting a clumsy, frantic path down the hall. It’s almost touching. Like a love letter written in panic. It leads me straight to where I knew she’d be.
She’s collapsed on top of the bed, her body curled protectively over the children. Even in her twitchy, dying state, she's trying to shield them. Noble. Pointless.
Her blood seeps out in thick, warm rivers, pooling beneath her and dripping from the mattress in slow, heavy drops. It's beautiful. Like a sunset melting across the linens. But I prefer it on walls. So I give it the space to bloom.
There’s rhythm to it—pulse, spray, pulse. It sings to me, a wet and messy melody. Like applause, just for me.
The children are under the bed, exactly where they always are. Predictable. Easy. No fun. Like fish in a tank with the glass already cracked.
Quick and sharp. That's all they get.
When it's done, I step back. Take in the scene. My masterpiece. Blood-slick sheets, red handprints on pale wallpaper, bodies arranged in a final, frozen tableau.
Pride warms my chest.
I gather them up, one by one, and drag them back to the parents’ room. It’s quiet work now. Methodical. I lay them out gently—tucked in, neat and clean, like bedtime stories were just read and lights just turned off. Their night’s over. Let them rest.
I close their eyes.
Lock the door behind me.
And walk away into the hush.
Let them dream.
I blink my eyes open, I feel my pupils shaking and note sweat rolling down my face. I pulled all of the pictures into one group before grabbing the next. I make eye contact with the agent before me. Her face betrays her curiosity that I find distasteful. 
“It is very interesting to watch you work. I’ve never seen anyone with the same look on your face after looking at pictures like that.”
“I would prefer if you didn’t watch. Also, curious, what look would that be?”
“See I’m not sure what expression you have but it’s an odd one”
“I’m flattered” I say, keeping my voice light, but sarcastic, as not to scare her. The “charm” is useful and works well enough.
“Hey I don’t care how you do your work, every homicide case you’ve had you’ve turned around and caught the bad guy. As long as you get it done, legally preferably, I don’t care” 
I grab the next set of photographs in response. As to be expected the walls carry the same scraps and the first. Similar circumstances as well, though no children this time, just a man and a woman. If I were alone now, I would do another dive to understand the killer more, but the eyes of the agent itch at my skull. It’s an uncomfortable experience. 
“Okay,  I’ll do a run down of everything with the team.”
“They’re in the next room waiting for you” she nods at the door 
I take a calculated breath to still the shakiness before pushing though. I don’t look at the team, but there are 5 people in the room. Eye contact typically leads to conversation, and I’d rather finish the work before taking with them. In the center of the room, I find the whiteboard, and I hang up the pictures in order. 
I feel their eyes on me as I work. It’s not pleasant. 
“This killer has just figured out how fun it is to kill another human being. So I’d check out records for anyone with animal cruelty charges within the past few years. This man is between the ages of 22 to 40 and has to be more physically fit than these victims. He has history in lock picking, there was no sign of forced entry. The scratches that line the wall show that he finds joy in the fact that he knows he’s going to kill these people and they are none the wiser. He has pride in what he does, and he feels the most ultimate pleasure in ending their lives. He believes himself stronger than anyone he meets, and he probably thinks he’s smarter aswell.” With that I pointed at the team and ask what they have.
“The weapon used was premeditated, a knife with serrated edge, which would also explain the unclean scratches on the side walls.” He spoke this with such disdain in his voice. His identification tag reads “Mickey Coxx” 
“The blood splatter shows that the perpetrator was trying to hit arteries to make the blood go farther. “ a tall man with a clean shaven face says. His name tag read “Roy Tucson”
“Good, that means thats apart of his MO, he thinks 'Not only can I hurt you, I can exaggerate your pain and you still can’t stop me.' As well as 'This is my doing. Look how far I can make you suffer.' He thinks of his kills like a game, and is making a spectical of it. “
“They were positioned laying down all together at the end, if he thinks it’s a game, why did he do that?” This team member has solid black hair and questions written across her face. Her name tag reads “joeann Quincy.” I admire how much courage it takes to ask, there seems to be a level of disdain for questions in this office for whatever reason. 
“Laying them to rest afterwards can imply a twisted sense of affection or possessive tenderness. It’s not guilt- it’s a delusional intimacy, where he believes he’s giving them ‘peace’ after ‘fun’ as if he’s still doing them a favor. It reflects narcissistic detachment- he sees himself as not only the executioner, but also the one who grants peace. He’s done playing so they need to rest.” I let out a quiet sigh, now noticing that all of them are staring again. 
“Let’s get to work then, I gave you my analysis” 
They all nod and turn to start their individual conversations and work
It’s the best description I could give them before they start to ask questions. People begin questioning my work and opinion if I give them too many answers. As long as they catch the killer, Ive given them enough. That doesn’t mean I don’t want to solve it, it’s curious how killers think they can get away.  The pictures are enough to give them a decent start. I want to see the scene for myself, even if it was already cleaned, there is still always feelings left it the space that I can feed off of. Some say it’s a “gut feeling” or a “premonition” but it just tells me what I need to know. 
I walk quickly to my car, no desire to talk to people right now. Plus I find my car familiar, no need to change anything about it. A machine is easily fixable, and I’ve always had  an affinity for diagnosing and fixing machines.This includes my car, it’s an old ‘68 Chevellle. Fixing it up gave me things to do. 
The ride there was not far. I grab my badge from my glovebox in case there’s someone else in there. The house was cleaned quite throughly, I will give that to the crime scene cleaners. It matches the pictures quite well, albeit it lacks the blood. There’s a certain satisfaction of seeing the work of another, even in this way. It is just frustrating though, not being able to touch everything. The gloves dampened everything. 
This man, he had a rebelious childhood- probably due to a traumatic or unstable household while growing. He wouldve had loved playing games as a child, the satisfaction probably led him to much more dangerous things. High risk high reward. he doesnt think he has anything to lose, other than the high of satisfaction. its dangerous. 
So if he didnt care, there has to be something to give him away. Whatever things were left over for me, mustve been cleared out by the cleamers. A Shame. 
So what could give him away? 
My ears pick up a  light knock on the front door, unexpected. I tuck myself behind the door of a nearby room, if its an oficer ill come around the corner, if its not then ill be able to watch to see what they do. 
“Hello?” The voice rang out. “Anybody home?” There was a moment of hesitation before the front door was pushed open.
This older lady has a sweet voice, much like in the old movies, and as she walks through the house she hums a sweet old tune. I listen to her walk by, and then I moved from my hiding space. With that I take a seat in the couch, it seems appropriate, waiting for her to loop back around to the front. 
As much as I don’t like conversation, I have a few questions to ask this lady. 
“Oh hello! You quite scared me dear”
“Hello” I  responds throwing a smile on my face “I’m detective Samuel Cordello” I show her my badge, though I doubt she wouldve cared to check.
“Oh a detective? What happened?” shes got curiosity written all over her face. 
“There is an investigation underway here, a potential serial murder. This family fell victim” 
That caused the older lady to slump her shoulders and look down at the ground. 
“How do you know the family ms…”
“June, Mrs June. Ive know the family for a few years. I’m not one to leave the house often, Ive got a bad leg. But I’ve watched their children before and I’ll bring some snacks here and there”
“Well, I’m sorry for your loss Mrs June” 
“Do you know what happened?”
“Yes, but it’s quite disturbing”
“Oh alright. I don’t want to hear if you think so. I hope you catch him. Oh I bet it was that old kid who lives across the way. Always into trouble that one was.”
This piqued my interest.
“Would you be able to give me an address?”
“Yes of course young man”

I recently moved to Riyadh (it's been around 10 months so not so recent) and I’m still getting settled in. It’s been great exploring the city so far, but I realized I don’t really know many people here yet, so I thought I’d reach out and see if there are others in a similar boat.

A little about me: I work in software development, and I’m really into tech, gaming, movies and just generally having good conversations with interesting people. I enjoy both quiet nights gaming or talking about the latest in tech, as well as grabbing a coffee maybe smoking some shisha or hanging out in person when possible.

Some of my hobbies/interests:

* Tech & coding (happy to geek out about software stuff with fellow devs)

1ly9nx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1ly9nx2/cat_ear_issues/,Cat Ear Issues,"I’ve had my babies, Adonis and Apollo, since May of last year. I adopted them at 13 weeks old. At the initial meet and greet, I noticed Apollo had thick, dark wax (consistency of coffee grounds) in his right ear. The foster offered to take them back for a week to treat what they suspected was an ear infection, so I officially took them home after that and was given the remaining Tresaderm drops. The wax came back a couple weeks later, although more fluid-like and lighter in color, so I finished the Tresaderm on a week-on, week-off schedule. Since then, so for over a year, the fluid in his ear and a slight odor has come back every couple of weeks. When he shakes his head, it almost sounds like a baby rattle from the fluid build-up. I’ve taken him to three different vets over the last year who have each prescribed different courses of drops to try to clear up the fluid as well as doing ear cytologies to rule out other issues (no deformities, no active infection with redness or swelling, etc), so the fluid is not from an ear infection. The most recent vet is suspecting that it may be an allergy because he gets acne on his chin occasionally as well. Has anyone else ever dealt with something like this before? Could this just be a lifelong ear issue because of the initial infection he had as a kitten? If he went the first few weeks of his life before I adopted him with an untreated infection, would that have consequences to this day? My next course of action is to get his blood tested for allergens, but that’s gonna run me at least $800 on top of the couple grand I’ve already spent taking him to these vet visits over the last year. Just trying to see if anyone else has ever experienced this and if you were able to get your baby some relief. He doesn’t seem in pain at all, has a great appetite, no potty issues and always wants to play, just shakes his hand with annoyance when the fluid builds up.",1,1752350549.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False

I know this because she made it her entire personality in under thirty seconds. She ordered a Salted Caramel Cold Brew and asked for the cold foam without vanilla. We calmly let her know the cold foam is pre-batched with vanilla syrup and can’t be changed. That should’ve been the end of it.

Instead, she cocked her head with the smugness of someone who thinks their 2016 apron should be framed at headquarters and said, “Actually I used to work at Starbucks and vanilla isn’t in the recipe so you’re making it wrong.”

Ma’am. You used to work here. The keyword is used. Past tense. Irrelevant. The same way floppy disks used to be a thing. The same way Blockbuster used to matter. And just like those things your Starbucks knowledge has expired, collected dust, and lost all usefulness in the modern world.

You’re not a barista anymore. You’re a customer with delusions of grandeur. No one cares that you used to press buttons on a clover machine or that you once told someone their pink drink would take a few extra minutes. You don’t sound credible. You sound like a grown woman clinging to a part-time job from years ago like it makes you an industry expert. Spoiler alert it doesn’t.

Thankfully we had a partner nearby who actually knows what they’re talking about. Turns out the recipe was changed years ago. So not only was she wrong she was confidently wrong. Loud wrong. First-day-of-Reddit wrong. And somehow still arguing like we’re going to throw out current corporate standards because she said so.

She still got her drink. We still made it correctly. She still drove away sipping the very vanilla foam she swore didn’t exist. But the real point here is simple. If you used to work here and you think that gives you permission to talk down to the people currently running the show you’re not helpful. You’re not wise. You’re not seasoned. You’re just annoying.

Coming back to a Starbucks like you’re the ghost of baristas past and expecting everyone to bow down to your outdated training is embarrassing. This isn’t your redemption arc. This isn’t a masterclass. This is you acting superior while being factually useless. You’re not a mentor. You’re a menace. You’re not bringing insight. You’re bringing delusion.

And let’s not forget we see you. This isn’t a phone call where you can hide behind your bad attitude. You’re right in front of us throwing a fit over a foam recipe and expecting applause for it. We’re not impressed. We’re not moved. We’re counting down the seconds until we can close the window and laugh about it.

If your only personality trait is that you used to make coffee and now you weaponize that experience to bully current employees you don’t look experienced. You look pathetic. You look pressed. You look like someone who peaked in green and black polyester and never emotionally recovered.

The truth is you’re not a Starbucks veteran. You’re a retired extra trying to steal the spotlight from the cast still onstage. And all we really want is for you to take your vanilla foam and your superiority complex and exit quietly.

Stage left. Preferably with a straw in your mouth and no more words coming out of it.

1ly9l2p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ly9l2p,Please help us revive our favorite coffee table!,"I purchased this coffee table from a Goodwill in the early ‘00’s. It seems to have solid wood legs and lower shelf, but the top is some sort of wood covered in laminate. It feels very smooth, glossy, and plastic-y and is nice for repelling water and spills with no worry about stain to the wood. In other words- we like the laminate plastic-y top it has. The wood under the laminate seems to be okay, but I don’t think it’s meant to be exposed.

Unfortunately, for the last 10 years we’ve been dealing with the laminate surface pulling back on the sides of the table. Last month, a piece of laminate even came off completely.

I’ve tried re-gluing with J-B weld, E6000, and some other 2 part epoxy, but the repairs only seem to last a few months before the laminate pops up and peels back again. 

The difficulty we run into now is that there is a thick layer of multiple types of epoxy stuck on both the table and the pieces of laminate, and the laminate itself is sort of “bowed” and no longer lays flat. We also struggle with clamping after applying adhesive as the corners are beveled. 

What sort of options do we have to bring this table back to its full glory?

1ly9kqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ridiculousness/comments/1ly9kqv/part_3_i_worked_as_a_production_intern_on_the/,Part 3: I worked as a production intern on the show for the past three seasons.,"Hey everyone, thanks again for all the support on my last couple of posts. Before I share more behind the scenes nuggets, I wanted to give everyone an update. I can’t go into too much detail, but I’m at a crossroads with Ridiculousness. It seems like I might be moving up on the show if I stay, but this isn’t the type of entertainment career I envisioned for myself. On the other hand, I don’t know if I should take this for granted because success in the TV industry is so hard to come by. What do you guys think I should do? 

Anyways, enjoy: 

* One of the producers is very particular about how he likes his coffee. If one of the interns gets it wrong, he’ll spend the remainder of the shoot still drinking the coffee and grimacing with each sip, making passive aggressive comments about how it’s “not quite right.” 
* One day we had to do over 20 takes for one segment because Steelo kept getting his line wrong. The line? “Ayo, he buggin.” He kept insisting that he “wasn’t feeling his delivery” of the line. 
* When Chanel was pregnant, the other hosts and high-ranking staffers threw a surprise baby shower for her on set. They invited a bunch of famous people and viral social media stars (they tried to get Welven Da Great to come, but there was a scheduling conflict). They even filmed the entire thing and planned to release it as a special, but after Chanel announced her departure it was scrapped and is now lost media. The editing team spent months on it and nearly quit in frustration. 
* There are a bunch of Rob’s Mindright bars constantly sitting on the crafts services table. They are all unwrapped (my supervisor says this is so they “look classy”). A lot of them go uneaten, and are taken to the dumpster behind the studio. After a while of disposing of them there, we realized that the dead raccoons we were finding nearby must have died from eating the Mindright bars (fellow raccoon owners, be warned). The studio then fitted the dumpster lids with padlocks to keep the raccoons out. I think the Mindright bars must be melting and leaking out of holes in the dumpster though, because every once in a while a dead raccoon will turn up again. The lower ranking interns are put on raccoon duty when this happens, to dispose of the bodies. 
* Here’s one I didn’t even think to include in an earlier post, because if you’ve worked here for long enough, it feels like old news. But none of the designer they wear on set is real. 
* One day during filming, the boom mic operator stormed off set after Rob and the other hosts watched traffic footage of a car accident at a busy intersection. He insists this was footage of the same car accident that his mom died in. I have no idea if that’s true, but he listed off the year, make, and model of the car involved, and it seemed to match up. For the record, I’m still not sure I believe him, because how would the producers have gotten that footage? Either way, he quit the show later that day, but one of the execs tried to get him to stay by offering a lifetime supply of Mindright bars. 
* As for some good news, the staff is beginning to warm up to Lolo!

I got tired of the “Anyone up for…?” messages that die in group chats, so I spent a few nights hacking together a little iOS app called **Joynme**.

*What it does*

1. You post whatever you’re about to do; walk in a park, coffee somewhere, go to a museum.
2. You can select how many people do you want to join you, (1, 2 or max 3). you can also specify some more details about the cost and what not.
3. People within \~50 km see it and can request to join.
4. On approval, a mini chat opens so you can sort details and meet up.

This is still a **public beta**, dark-mode only, and rough around the edges, exactly why I’d love some local fellas who can try it and tell me what works well and what sucks.

App is only available for iOS now, will be available for android pretty soon.

He started talking about a new girl he works with a lot, which was new so I was a little suspicious since he doesn’t talk about female coworkers like that. He would mention wanting to pull her aside and warning her about another guy at work she would talk to. He even gave her $20 since she helped him on a tough day at work when no one else did, and wanted to let her know he appreciated it and also give her some money since she’s had conversations with him about how much she gets paid and wanting to make more. Apparently she is in a relationship with someone she wants to leave so she’s putting money back to do that. He told me he feels bad for her, and he would tell me things like she’s crazy, had a kid really young, etc to reassure me that he wasn’t interested in anyway and they just work together.

He has a guy at work he works with that he’s become good friends with and have hung out a few times. My partner recently told me his friend wanted him to go with him to a cars and coffee event. I thought it was cool, and I had planned a surprise for his childhood friends to come up and hang out with him since he’s been working hard and doing well at work - plus his bday was recent - so suggested his friends could go as well. He ended up asking his friends not to come down because it’s been crazy for him at work and asked to reschedule. He still planned to go with his work friend to this event. He then told me that wasn’t happening either because his friend ended up having to work. I found out on my own that this new girl was an event coordinator for this event and was a photographer.. and that the event was actually rescheduled to the next weekend which is why they didn’t go..

He told me that yeah, he didn’t tell me she would be there or that she invited him because there was nothing there and he didn’t want me to think there was. That he WAS going to go with his work friend to support her, since she invited him (and apparently everyone else they work with). He said it’s important to him that he has good relationships with the people he works with, and I get that… I just feel like it’s possible to do that while working and this other stuff means he was hiding it. He got so scared that I messaged her, because he didn’t want to seem “crazy” and told me he would handle it.

Do I think he is physically cheating? No. But I do think he’s interested. He’s been unsure of our relationship lately as well, and I wonder if he might be wondering what it would be like to be with someone else but not fully commit to leaving in case it doesn’t work out or he wants to stay? I doubt he would have told me if I didn’t find out. I don’t really know what to do..",1,1752350159.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I’m not close with either of them, but I get along better with one than the other.

I have a 20-year-old boyfriend. We usually stay at his place, but his house is being renovated, so we've been spending more time at mine. (He’s living with his parents during the renovation, not with me.)

Last week, we were cooking in my kitchen when one of my roommates came in. He said hi and went to his room. No problem.

Then the other roommate (the one I don’t get along with) came in. I greeted him (which is rare for me because we don't really like each other). He said hi back, then turned to my boyfriend and asked, ""Who is he?"" I said, ""That’s my boyfriend.""

He gave my boyfriend this disgusted look and said: “Your boyfriend? I didn’t know you were gay. He has to leave.”

I was like, what? I asked why. He just said: “Because he’s gay.” I snapped and said: “You and your girlfriend are here all the time. She probably lives here without permission.” He got mad and stormed into his room, slamming the door.

We finished cooking and went to my room.

The next day I asked him what his problem was. He said: “What problem? I don’t want any gay ruining this place.” I was shocked.

Three days later, I came home and heard noises from the kitchen (you can see part of it from the front door, but the table is around a corner). This homophobic roommate was literally having sex on the dining table. I was disgusted.

They saw me, and he started yelling at me. I yelled back that I was calling the landlord. That night I barely slept (2 hours) because I couldn't stop thinking about it (so gross).

In the morning I called the landlord and told him what happened. He was so shocked he nearly choked on his coffee. He also told me the last tenant who lived in my room left because of this same roommate.

My roommate got an eviction notice and is now packing his stuff.

So, Reddit, AITA for getting my roommate evicted?

I was thinking maybe the coffee has calories and if that even matters? (I recently read about negative caloric intake or something) Thanks in advance. ",0,1752349757.0,intermittentfasting,8,0.5,False

Because this might sound like a Netflix show. Or a badly written soap opera. But unfortunately — I’m the lead character in this mess.

So, I told my parents and relatives that I’m working in London.

Spoiler alert: I’m not.

I’m very much in India. In my room. Dodging relatives’ video calls and praying my UPS power backup doesn’t die during fake “London Zoom meetings.”

But wait — it gets better (or worse, depending on how much second-hand embarrassment you can handle).

⸻

Rewind to a year ago.

I met this guy on Bumble. A London guy. British accent, cute smile, said all the right things. Classic setup. We started talking every day. Slowly, I fell hard — like full-on headfirst, no helmet.

He said he loved me. Promised to help me move to London. Said he’d get me a job, and we’d live together. As someone from a super orthodox family, this sounded like a fairytale with Wi-Fi and international roaming.

But I didn’t stop there. I introduced him to my family.
Yes. You read that right.

My entire family met this man on video calls.
He was charming, respectful, and said he’d marry me. Even my strict relatives turned into mush. My parents were like “Wow, UK mapillai, modern-aana Tamil paiyan!”

I felt like I had won the jackpot.

So what did I do?

Naturally, I told my family I got a job in London. Packed my bags (literally empty, only snacks inside), and said “I’m moving!”

Except… I didn’t.

I moved to the other room in my house.

I told them my company’s paying for my stay in London, and I’ll be traveling to Europe every month. “Oh sorry ma, I’m flying to Spain tomorrow, will call you next week!” — all while sitting in my room eating mixture.

⸻

Meanwhile…

This so-called “love of my life” kept delaying things.
He said he lives with his deaf grandma (no, I’m not making this up) and had a “very complicated family.”

But when I asked him for an invitation letter for the visa, he ghosted. No calls. No texts. But yes — plenty of Instagram stories with other girls.

I confronted him. He acted innocent. I cried. He disappeared.

And I was stuck with a fake life in London, and a very real heartbreak right here.

⸻

Now I’m maintaining the biggest lie of my life.
I post random pics with generic captions like

“Another day, another airport ✈️”
or
“Brunch in Paris 🇫🇷 (actually just vadai and filter coffee)”

Relatives think I’m some international jet-setter.
My parents keep bragging about me to neighbors —

“Our daughter is in London. She just went to Switzerland last week.”
Yeah. The only Swiss thing I’ve seen is Dairy Milk.

I never let them talk to my friends because obviously, the whole façade will come crashing down faster than a government site on deadline day.

⸻

I know this is bad. I know I messed up.
But I just wanted to be loved, okay?

I didn’t ask him for money or anything. I just… trusted him. Fought my family for him. Believed his words. And now, I’m living a full-on fantasy life I never wanted to create.

At this point, I feel like the main character in a show called “Emily Without Paris” — without the job, without the Eiffel Tower, and definitely without the hot guy.

If you’re still reading this: thank you.
If you’re lying to your parents right now: I feel you.

Hey there redditors,
 My name's Lindsey,  lazy day..  yes!

It's been a lackluster summer so far, but hopefully it improves this month.

I hope your summer is going well or maybe your like me and its nice to talk to somebody that's outside of your day to day grind or whatever your going through.

I'm basically going through a rough patch again in life but I'll bounce back as always 

I'm looking for what I mentioned above. ⬆️

Maybe we just need a friendly chat , who try to understand and listen making connections where you wouldn't think of one to occur.

A few things about me.

*I love music production and anything to do with it 
/( Yes I know everyone but music as a bullet point in interests.

But it's worthwhile to mention I do like to play and learn guitar.
Etc. etc . Lol

* I absolutely Love reading and watching Horror movies.. I gravitate towards slashers and psychological thriller. Suspense is just oxygen to me lol.

Books yes . Dogs or cats ?  Dogs here 

Cooking .. hell yes 🤤 
I don't play much games nowadays. I love black coffee/ Americano
I do like racing games and some fighting games. Mostly fallout and Mortal Kombat Mobile.
Mental health advocate/ empathetic 
Physical fitness .  So so

I'm not doing much for a few days so I'm game to spark up a friendship & chat.

I am looking to get ideas. I was at our choir picnic today and somehow we got to the topic of people with same sex attraction attending Mass. One of the people said that her friend who is gay does not want to come to mass because he feels judged. And i think another person chimed in as well with the same sentiment.

At our parish, when you arrive for Sunday Mass, there are usually 2 people waiting at the door. They say good morning to you and hand you the hymnal. We do not do this for the evening Mass because less people attend, so you just pick up your hymnal on your own. Then you just head to the pews to get sitted. At the end of every Mass, we announce the social activities that go on during the week and the groups that one can join, Rosary group, women’s group, men’s group etc, and who to see if you want to join. We also have coffee after Mass in the hall every other Sunday for people to socialise.

So I am not really sure what more we are supposed to do to make people feel welcome. Usually before Mass there is no chit chatter as people are trying to prepare for Mass. I don’t really know what they expect us to do, someone also mentioned that it might just be in their head that people are judging them, because our community is not even that tight knit and we get a lot of new faces.

I want to give a massive shoutout to [Voodoo Child](https://www.youtube.com/@VoodooChildAudios/featured), [Seras](https://www.youtube.com/@Nomi_VT), [Gracie](https://www.youtube.com/@GracieAudios) and [Luna Seven](https://www.youtube.com/@SevenofSwordsVA) for having filled one or more parts of this series at the time of my posting this.

That's 4 more VAs than I was expecting to pick up this series. Not to undersell my own writing, but simply because I felt this would be one of those works of mine that would have more readers than listeners. Each part in this series is very long, and not exactly easy to adapt for the microphone. But I'm surprised in the best of ways, and sincerely grateful to all of you incredibly talented VAs.

Oh, and if you've filled a part as well but I forgot to mention you, then....I'm deeply sorry, I may or may not owe you a free commission, and you can definitely punch me really hard as retribution.

And to all you folks who have been sharing the posts, leaving comments, reading, or just keeping an eye on this series-

Thank you. Mrrrrnowwwww. (That's a happy cat sound)

By the way, guys, funny story! A few days ago, a VA messaged me saying she was thinking of filling part 1. She'd read all the parts I'd written until then, you see, and she asked- well, more like *demanded*\- for me to be her boyfriend, because she apparently loved my writing!!!! You know how some of you guys learned to play *Wonderwall* on guitar back in school to score? This was kind of similar, except....well, generally speaking, nobody wants to get with the writer.

I told myself, ""Now now, hold on a minute! Stuff like this almost *never* happens! There's no way she actually means that."" So I told u/edgiscript about it, who happened to be at a horse race at the time. And he agreed, ""Now now, hold on to your horses! Stuff like this almost *never* happens! There's no way she actually meant that, buddy.""

Well, we were correct in a way. The VA followed up 5 minutes later by texting me she did mean what she said, but she'd also break up with me within a month if we ever got together. While she enjoyed reading my scripts, she also observed they were needlessly demanding to fill, and would require a lot of her time and energy, and not necessarily generate a ton of views. And you know what? She was absolutely right! And also....

None of this actually happened, and I'm just joking. But you....you guys get the point I'm trying to make.

In a nutshell: If you're still here....thank you, sincerely, for staying with this series until the very end. I'm happy you discovered my work :-))

**SCRIPT:**

(Whispering) Don’t die.

(Repeating to herself, quietly) Don’t die. Don’t die. You have to live. You have to. There’s- there’s so much out there, still left for you and me to see.

Don’t die. Please. My darling, all I can do is talk to the shadows on the wall, and pray you can hear me.

Can you hear me, sweetheart?

Don’t die. (Whispering) Please.

Live. Live, my little snowflake. I....I can’t imagine a world without you.

Please, don’t abandon me. I need you. (Whispering, heartbroken) I need you so much. I love you. I....

(Breathless) Doctor? How is he? How is my snowflake?

Oh...? I was sitting out here all night?

Huh. I didn’t notice. But- Snowflake- is he alright?

(A longer pause)

(Sighing, like the weight of the world is lifted off her shoulders) Oh, thank the heavens! And thank you! Thank you so much. I won’t forget this, doctor.

Is Snowflake still in bed? Is he still there just beyond these doors?

Alright. *(SFX: Sound of boots)* I am going to see him. I....I am going to apologize.

I am going to make things right.

*(Boots stop)*

(Very softly) What?

(A longer pause)

My snowflake.....doesn’t want to see me?

(Another pause)

He said that?

I see. He’s not accepting any visitors right now. He is still in trauma.

(Blank, monotonic) Yes. It might be a good idea for him to not see me so soon after I....did this to him.

It’s not my fault?

Okay.

My darling must be scarred. Traumatized. He is still- still-

(Pausing again)

My husband doesn’t want to see me....?

(Quietly, to herself) But Snowflake, you are right there. You are right behind these sterile grey doors. All I have to do is push them open, and enter, and then you’ll be there. I can....I can see you again, alive and breathing and confused. Cocking your head. Looking at me. I can.....see you again.

No, doctor. It’s nothing. Please take good care of him. I’ll be sending letters and flowers. Tell him I would like to see him when he’s ready. Can you please do that?

Thank you. I appreciate it.

*(SFX: Boots walking away, reluctantly)*

Oh, and-

Tell him I’m sorry. For everything.

*(Boots slowly fade away)*

...

....

.....

(Whispering) It’s you.

(Barely audible) It really is you.

Ssshhh. Please, do not scream. Don’t be alarmed. It’s just me. It’s just your Stella.

It’s okay. I’m here because I....

I wanted to see you.

I’m sorry for breaking and entering at night, while everyone is asleep. I could’ve forced my way in during visiting hours, but I didn’t want to put the doctors and nurses in a dilemma. And I didn’t want you to feel stressed.

(Trying to lighten the mood) Guess I’m not doing so well with the latter, huh?

(A longer pause)

The bouquets by your bedside are still wrapped in cellophane. And the boxes of chocolate seem untouched.

If I open the drawer of your nightstand, I will find my letters to you still sealed and unread, won’t I?

(Another long pause)

It’s okay. I understand, really. I showed up here everyday for the last six days, hoping they’d finally let me see you. Just for five minutes. I kept hoping you’d decide to let me in. But I couldn’t see you.

I’m sorry. I just had to be with you again. I missed you so, so much! And I....I wanted to apologize.

For all the ways I hurt you.

Yes. You chose to- to take my blade through your heart- but it’s my decisions that pushed you towards making that choice. I loved you so much, I failed to realize I was being selfish. I was hurting you. (Faintly) Funny how that works out. I claim to love you, and yet, everything I do drives you away from me.

You didn’t deserve any of what happened, Snowflake. Just seeing you lying there in bed, your face full of warmth and colour- that look which I’m so familiar with....that makes me so glad.

I don’t think I could have gathered the will to keep on living if you never opened your eyes again. I couldn’t. (Smiling, heartbroken) You really did save me, my sweet little snowflake. You’ve been trying to save and protect me all this time. I’m sorry for taking so long to fully appreciate it. But I understand now. I swear I do.

(A longer pause)

Your friend Ameera....? No, she’s still alive.

After you- (taking a deep, shaky breath)- after what happened, I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. You almost died just to shield her from me. Taking her life felt like an insult to your memory. I couldn’t do it.

She and I can never really be on friendly terms after everything that has happened, but hey, at least we’re not trying to actively kill each other anymore huh? (A small, half-hearted laugh)

She was waiting quite anxiously to hear about your condition. After I told her you were alright, she briefly came here to this hospital to see you. You were asleep. I think she purposefully chose to enter this room while you were sleeping. She probably thought it was best for you to not see her anymore, but she wanted one last glimpse of you.

Yes. She’s gone now. I granted her safe passage out of this city. The past....is now finally behind us.

What is it, my dear? Are you sad about Ameera?

....Not just about her?

(A longer pause)

I see. I’m sad too, that things ended this way. Our best laid plans always seem to get swept up by the winds, don’t they?

*(SFX: Gentle night winds. Soft clinking of wind chimes.)*

Can I sit beside you on the bed?

Thanks.

*(SFX: Brief sound of footsteps)*

*(SFX: Faint rustling of bedsheets)*

Hey. That’s a pretty nice view from your window. The lights of the city appear so small from here. And far, far away, I can just make out the ocean. Imagine the grand ships returning to the sleepless ports of Argellan. Sailors drinking in the taverns, or returning home to their families for the first time in months.

(Faintly) I always wanted a family of my own, you know?

Yeah. After I lost my parents, and then Sylvia, I never really had anyone. Even in the military- the only place where I felt like I belonged- I lost so many people I came to know and call friends.

It seems everyone leaves me in the end, willingly or unwillingly. Or I push them away. Willingly, or.....

(Whispering) Or with a heart full of regret, and hands that freeze everything they touch.

(A longer pause)

Do you mean that, Snowflake? Do my hands really feel warm in yours?

These hands....they have never frozen you?

(With the ghost of a smile) I’m glad you think so. (Whispering gently) You beautiful liar.

This ring really does look pretty on your finger. The blue stones are glinting and shining softly in what little light fills this room. But they’re also ever so faintly luminous with a light of their own.

When I imbued this ring with my magic, I wished for it to protect you from everything. Including me.

This ring is why you were able to undo my freezing spell, and jump in front of me. It helped you escape from my ice, only for you to get gravely wounded by the same ice I created.

I think the ring was just responding to your will. Respecting what you really wanted. (Softer) Something which I always failed to do. How very....strange.

(A longer pause)

Come with me, darling.

Come back home. I miss you.

I came here tonight, to take you back with me. I....I want you by my side so, so much. It’s all I want.

We could go somewhere far away from all of this. Take all the time we need, and only return to this place when we are both ready.

It’ll be like a long vacation. Just you and me, and the endless adventures that lie in store for us. We could go anywhere you wanted.

You wouldn’t be keeping me from anything, my sweet. You....are more important to me than anything else in the world.

I love you. I always have.

(Whispering) Come with me. Please.

We can leave right now. We can go back to my mansion, or get aboard one of my private ships down by the harbour and set sail. Anything you want. I will be with you every step of the way. I will....I will show you this heart of mine isn’t a lie. It’s beating because of you.

Let me take you back home, darling. Let me care for you again.

Yes. Yes, you can. All you have to do....is say yes.

(Whispering) Come with me.

(A spell of silence)

You haven’t changed, my sweet. (Smiling) You’re still too kind to tell me no.

(Whispering) But you can’t say yes either.

(Pausing again)

I made you a promise back then, didn’t I? I’d set you free, as long as you still lived in this world.

(Lovingly caressing his cheek) I can’t break a promise to my snowflake.

(Voice cracking) I can’t. Never again. I....I want you- need you- from the deepest depths of my heart. But I wish for you to be happy. To always smile, and walk in the light. In an endless field of the prettiest sunflowers there ever were.

I want you to be happy. (Barely a whisper) Even if it isn’t with me.

But as long as you wear this ring, it’s not possible. It binds you to me and won’t let you go.

*(SFX: Soft sound of magic. A tiny clinking noise, like a single fracture through glass.)*

There.

It’s....it’s undone. Now it’s just a mundane ring. Blue gemstones which no longer glow with their own light, placed on a band of silver- as nice as it looks on you, you may take it off anytime now. It’s just jewellery.

Hm? What is it, my dear?

(A longer pause)

It means more to you than that? Even now? Even after- ?

I see.

Maybe in another life, had we met under kinder circumstances, things could have gone very differently for us, huh?

We would still be in my bed, tucked under the blankets. You nuzzling into me, as I held you in my arms. We....(whispering, almost to herself) could’ve been together.

What happens now....? I don’t know.

For the first time in a long time, I don’t know what I’m going to do. But the notion of uncertainty doesn’t feel liberating. It’s just stifling. It just makes me feel lost.

(Struggling not to cry) I want so much to just take you right now, and carry you home with me. I love you, Snowflake. You....you are my everything.

(Ragged, uneven breathing) I know what love is, now. And even if my love is toxic and dangerous, I still love you. And I always will. I’m sorry.

No. Don’t feel sorry for my sake. Don’t blame yourself. All you were trying to do, was go back to your old way of life. With all its good and bad. I think it’s just fine, you know?

To choose cold comfort over change. To be a cat free to explore the entire world, than to be curled up on a velvet cushion as someone’s pet.

Well, I too could have gone about things differently. But it doesn’t matter now. We- we are here, at the end of the line.

Hey, Snowflake?

Can I....have a hug?

Please?

*(SFX: Movement over the bedsheets)*

(Breathing slowly, gently, up close) Thank you.

I really am going to miss you, you know?

(A longer pause)

(Very quietly) Sometimes, you end up hurting the person you love so badly, that the only thing you can do is to let them go.

*(SFX: Rustling of sheets again.)*

*(SFX: Soft footsteps, walking away slowly.)*

Where am I going....? (Smiling sadly) That is the question, isn’t it?

I will be alright, Snowflake. As long as you live, I still have reason to take one step in front of the other, and brave the storm.

I won’t let the storm win. I....I won’t be able to hurt you anymore.

(Soft) Oh, Snowflake. Do you really want to know the answer to that?

Will you see me again....?

Hm.

Take care of yourself, my sweet. Walk in the sunshine. And be kind to yourself. Please.

(Whispering) Try to be happy. For my sake, if not yours.

*(SFX: Wind chimes softly ringing in the night wind)*

Sweet dreams.

*(Her footsteps begin to disappear, as if covered by snow)*

...

....

.....

(A pause)

My dear Snowflake.

I hope this letter finds you well. Tomorrow, they are going to release you from the hospital, and you’ll be free.

Please come down to the harbour tomorrow by evening. There will be a ship waiting for you, on the eastern end. It’ll take you anywhere you want to go. Your old home, someplace new, someplace you might have always wanted to go. It’ll take you there.

Tomorrow....is also the day I am going to try and find my own freedom, for a short while. I have always wanted to visit the island province of Fjordshire. Now that the war is over, the island seems to have regained its splendour quite wonderfully.

Reyna says the sand on the beaches there is white as fairy tales, and the houses with their colourful tiled roofs, and the vibrant markets full of curious trinkets and thronging visitors are something out of a fairy tale as well. And she says the ocean waters there are bluer than my eyes.

Kind of weird of her to put it like that, but- whatever, I guess.

(Softly) It sounds nice.

I will be boarding a ship on the western end of the harbour tomorrow. It sets sail for Fjordshire in the evening as well, on the seventh chime of Argellan’s clock tower.

I think I really do need a holiday. To get away from all of this for a while, and come back when I’m ready. I....I think it’ll be good for me, you know?

You are no longer my prisoner. You are free to walk your own path now. But if it leads you to mine, then well....(soft chuckling) you know where to find me.

Whether you go to the east or the west, do only what your heart tells you, my darling. Be safe. Be happy. And, if I may make one last selfish request-

Please open this letter, and read it.

I love you, my Snowflake. Now and forever.

*(SFX: Brief scribbling on paper)*

Your Stella.

(A longer pause)

What do you think, Emmary? That’s not too sentimental, right?

....Right?

(Sighing) Just as annoying as ever, I see. (Smiling faintly) Em, my dear friend....will you be fine on your own?

Yes. You’ll have Easton with you, and all of the soldiers stationed here, and more regiments from the northern army if need be, but....will you be alright?

(Smiling happily) Of course. I don’t doubt you for a second, Em. I know I can rely on you to hold down the fort while I’m gone. And just so you know- I *will* be returning. I don’t know when- not yet- but I will come back.

Thank you, my dear. I’m glad you have such faith in me. You, and all the others. I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve your trust and faith, but I truly am grateful.

I will be boarding the silver dream again tonight. But this time, I’ll be travelling alone on that train. And the countryside will be covered in snow, and my window will probably be blurred by condensation due to the cold. And I....I won’t have anyone to annoy with trivia about the history of the train and our glorious Empire of Eluria.

It’s alright, my friend. I am sad for what is gone, but I am also grateful for what has been. (Fragile) I got to meet Snowflake, didn’t I?

I got to fall in love, and for a brief while, even be loved back.

Yes. No tears of farewell. No broken pieces of glass in my wake. No mourning. Just....being who I have always been.

Stella.

May your days as acting general be bright as spring, Emmary. Thanks for being there every step of the way. I will see you again in the future. I promise.

(Taking a deep breath)

(Softly) Tomorrow is going to be a nice day.

...

....

.....

*(SFX: Quiet ocean waves. Rippling of water.)*

It was a bad idea to stay awake reading all night.

Should’ve known I’d feel sleepy the moment I laid down to rest on this ship. (Stifling a yawn)

This weather doesn’t seem to be helping. There’s a light fog over the sea and harbour, and the sky is grey. Not stormy grey, but just a dull, monotonous grey.

Why, the weather is so gloomy and depressing, you decided to materialize again, old lady. I bet you love it.

You seem to be staring at the ocean with a strange curiosity, too. What’s up with that?

(Sighing) I know you usually materialize before something important- good or bad- and I suppose this voyage certainly counts as something important. But I’m not entirely sure.

If I didn’t know any better, I’d almost think you just wanted to keep me company.

I don’t really mind, old lady. Although you have much to learn in the ways of communicating, I am glad you listen to whatever I have to talk about without judging me. It’s refreshing.

Or maybe you just listen while silently judging me all the time. (Pouting) A bit like someone else I know. And I just can’t see your look of silent disapproval due to the veil covering your face.

Well, at least you are here.

You know I used to have a big sister once upon a time?

Yeah. She too refused to leave me alone when I was in a vacant or pensive mood. She used to say, “Better to have me for company than your sad thoughts”, and then look at me with such a pleased, almost smug smile on her face as she said it.

She was right, you know? Sylvia was always there to protect me from the world. She was such a gentle soul, but she’d do anything to protect what she cared about. (Smiling gently) Sylvia wanted to see the ocean one day. She used to tell me stories about how blue and pretty it was, even though she’d never seen it with her own eyes.

(Softly) Well, Sylvia? We are here now. I know there’s a fog around us, but look, you can still see a good part of the ocean from here.

You were right. It really is blue. It....really is pretty.

Do you think my snowflake is seeing the ocean too at this moment? Do you think he will find me before we set sail?

Hm. I....

(A longer pause)

Hey. Old lady. You still there?

Of course you are. You know, I just realized something. I can’t keep calling you old lady. And as catchy a name as “the witch in white” is, I’m afraid it’s quite a mouthful. And awfully pretentious. No offense.

(Sighing) Would it be alright with you if I called you Sylvia?

(A longer pause)

Huh. I can’t tell if it’s because of the wind, but your veil seemed to flicker for just a moment. I think that’s the most response I have had from you in a long time.

(Smiling ever so softly) Thanks. For watching over me after Sylvia died. It’s....almost like her spirit lived on in you.

I wonder what my darling is doing right now. Did his ship leave the shore already?

I wonder where he is.

(A small yawn) I feel tired, Sylvia. I think I’m just going to close my eyes for a while.

*(SFX: Gentle sound of ocean waves)*

(Speaking very softly, to herself)

Yeah. I’m just going to get some sleep before we set sail. I need it after everything that has happened. Right?

This....this was the right thing to do, wasn’t it?

I’m going to think of him everyday. I’m going to miss him every night when I return to an empty bed.

I will be walking along the white beaches of Fjordshire, wishing he was there so I could hold his hand again. (Smiling sleepily) So I could splash water on him and get him all drenched. Watch his face as he huffed and puffed and walked away in annoyance. Only for me to catch up to him, and hug him from behind, and nuzzle into the side of his neck, and....and drag him back into the shallows so I could splash water on him again. Hmph.

(A longer pause)

(Whispering) I wish he was here.

But this was....it was the right thing to do. My snowflake taught me to do the right thing for once. I can’t keep him with me if he’s unhappy. Then I....I would be sad too.

Look at me. I really need to get some sleep- just a brief nap- but here I am, talking to myself in my sleep.

....Huh. Maybe I did fall asleep. I can’t see the world around me because my eyes are closed.

But I.....

(Whispering) I can’t sleep.

(Another long pause)

(As if waking up after a brief nap) Mmnnn....what....what time is it?

Did I doze off....? Sylvia, are you still here?

Sylvia?

Hm. Maybe you’re playing hide and seek inside the fog. It certainly is getting thicker now. We’ll lose visibility if we don’t-

(Hushed) Wait. Do you hear that? It sounds like....footsteps.

Finally. I hope it’s the captain. Or at least one of the cabin crew. God knows I could use some coffee right now.

(Politely) Hey. Could you please step a bit closer? I can’t really see you properly in all this fog.

Just come a bit closer. Don’t be afraid. I’m General Estelle Eveningstar, but you can just call me Stella. What’s your name?

(Lingering silence)

Snowflake....? Is that.....you?

I was recently diagnosed with low cortisol after a saliva test with a naturopath confirmed. I have a few questions - if you have insight, I’d love to hear!

1. Does anyone have some positive success stories to give me a little extra hope?

2. Does anyone have increased anxiety with low cortisol? I’ve had GAD for over a decade, went off my meds thinking I was fine, went back on them after my anxiety spiked intensely. I’m pretty close to where I was prior to going off but think maybe the low cortisol is interfering with me getting “back to baseline.”

3. Should I cut out coffee? My naturopath said I didn’t necessarily need to but wonder if anyone has experience here. 

4. Does anyone else night eat? This has been a big thing for me for years - I wake up in the middle of the night and eat. They think it’s related to the low cortisol. Curious if anyone else has experienced this. 

5. If you used an adrenal complex supplement, how long did it take to notice any difference? I just started one. 

6. Any other general tips or advice would be amazing!

My best friend, lets call her Maya, and I did *everything* together. Until she started dating Jay. He was cute, sure. Charismatic, charming, but honestly not even my type. Still, she became obsessed. Not with *him*, but with the power of having him. Like dating Jay somehow made her hotter, more desirable.

Then came the shift. I noticed Maya started downplaying me in front of him, suddenly my clothes were ""trying too hard,"" my stories ""so dramatic,"" and one night at a party, I caught her whispering to Jay while I danced with someone: *""She’s just like that with everyone.""*

Something snapped.

A week later, I slid into Jay’s DMs with a perfectly timed “Hey, did you ever finish that playlist you were making?” Innocent. Just enough. He replied instantly.

From there, it snowballed. Late-night texts turned into ""accidental"" coffee run-ins. I leaned into the charm. The eye contact. The ""you get me more than she does"" vibes. Within two weeks, he kissed me.

I *paused*. Looked him dead in the eye. “You really shouldn’t be doing this,” I said.

He didn’t stop.

So I didn’t either.

I wasn’t in love. Not even close. But the *second* Maya saw a pic of us holding hands, blurry, leaked, but unmistakable, she lost it. Cried, cursed, posted a Notes app statement on IG about “snakes wearing lipstick.”

She dropped him. But she never dropped me.

Because the truth is… I wasn’t trying to steal her man.

I just wanted to see if I could.

1ly8ptt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlaskaAirlines/comments/1ly8ptt/red_eye_fc_question/,Red eye FC question,I’m taking a red eye from SEA-DFW in a couple weeks. I understand drink service is probably limited. I have only flown in FC once so I am still trying to understand the etiquette—don’t want to be a dick to the FAs— is it okay to ask for coffee about an hour before landing (if they don’t do drink service)?

1ly8pgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ly8pgt/aita_for_having_beef_with_a_4_year_old/,AITA for having beef with a 4 year old?,"This is my first time posting/ using Reddit, so I apologize if this is the wrong place to put this, I just need unbiased opinion. This is a throwaway account and for their privacy, I won't use any names.

I, (16F), have beef with my, (4M), nephew. He's just a kid, so I don't take any of this out on him/ be rude, but I've been crying myself to sleep lately because I feel like he's stolen my mom from me. Nowadays, it feels like EVERYTHING has to be centered around my nephew or his dad, (27M), aka my half-brother. And I get it, they need help: my sister-in-law (27F) isn't a good mom. She's narcissistic and cruel, so much so that my brother has kinda tapped out (from what i can tell, at least). He's depressed and does nothing but sleep and work long hours to avoid his family. He'd divorce her, but he doesn't want a broken family. 

With that out of the way, I can explain my frustration. Ever since my nephew was born, he and my brother have been my mom's full focus, it seems. My dad and I are just her second family, my brother has always been her first and foremost. But she is my everything. That's why it hurts so much to always walk in on her crying and praying for my brother and nephew. Now that she has grandbabies, she's tossed out the fact that she's still a parent with a kid who longs for her (me) so to fully embrace her new title of grandma. She's got this coffee mug I see while doing dishes that says ""my new name is grandma"" that she replaced my ""happy mother's day"" mug with, and it takes every bit of me not to just smash it against a wall. I miss my mommy, guys. I miss talking about things other than my brother and his family. I miss having mother-daughter outings without my nephew tagging along. Every free weekend she has, he has to be there, whining. He even got a whole year with her!! When we moved to a town an hour away, she never actually moved with us: she lived in my aunt's basement to stay in the same town as my brother. On Mondays (her off day), she would drive over and pick me up from school for a 30 minute lunch, then I wouldn't see her for another week. Meanwhile? I'd get texts of her and my nephew cuddling while I sobbed in my pillow, wishing I was still young enough for her to want. I know it's not his fault, but I hate him for stealing my mom from me! He's got other grandparents, a mom, dad, aunts, uncle's, cousins, friends, a sister, etc. I've got nothing but my mom, but no! He needs that too, the greedy bugger. At least when he's my age, I'll be 28 and will have my own kids for her to fawn over, and not everything will be about him for once. 

I know that's all a lot, I'm emotional right now. But AITA? And what do I do because this is all breaking my heart. ",0,1752348046.0,AmItheAsshole,8,0.33,False
1ly8p94,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1ly8p94/why_does_nespresso_suck/,Why does Nespresso suck?,"Let me start with this: the products itself are amazing. Every other part of the business sucks. My disabled mother has been waiting 3.5 weeks for her order of ice coffee caps. First off that’s ridiculous to have to wait that long, why do they have zero inventory? What type of business is this? Second, she called customer service just to see how long until it gets here and the guy on the phone was very rude. Not only is my mom disabled but she gives customer service zero problems ever. He was very rude. Nespresso please fix this! Buy some inventory!",0,1752348031.0,nespresso,6,0.09,False

Overcomplicating things right off the bat.I tried to automate everything at once – lights, thermostat, even my coffee maker – before really understanding what I *needed* versus what was just cool. That led to a bunch of unused (and expensive!) smart gadgets gathering dust and a system that felt more frustrating than helpful.

On the success side, focusing on specific problem areas worked wonders. For example, I kept forgetting to turn off lights when leaving the house, so setting up geofencing to automatically switch them off saved energy and reduced my stress. Similarly, automating my thermostat to adjust based on occupancy was a game-changer for comfort and energy bills.Now I'm curious, what are some automation projects you've found genuinely useful versus those that ended up being more trouble than they're worth? Any specific technologies or setups you found surprisingly effective (or surprisingly ineffective)?",1,1752347894.0,TechLifestyleHub,0,1.0,False
1ly8me6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ly8me6/what_do_you_think/,What do you think?,"I’ve been with my partner for 6 years and have known him even longer than that. He started talking about a new girl he works with a lot, which was new so I was a little suspicious since he doesn’t talk about female coworkers like that. He would mention wanting to pull her aside and warning her about another guy at work she would talk to. He even gave her $20 since she helped him on a tough day at work when no one else did, and wanted to let her know he appreciated it and also give her some money since she’s had conversations with him about how much she gets paid and wanting to make more. Apparently she is in a relationship with someone she wants to leave so she’s putting money back to do that. He told me he feels bad for her, and he would tell me things like she’s crazy, had a kid really young, etc to reassure me that he wasn’t interested in anyway and they just work together. 

He has a guy at work he works with that he’s become good friends with and have hung out a few times. My partner recently told me his friend wanted him to go with him to a cars and coffee event. I thought it was cool, and I had planned a surprise for his childhood friends to come up and hang out with him since he’s been working hard and doing well at work - plus his bday was recent - so suggested his friends could go as well. He ended up asking his friends not to come down because it’s been crazy for him at work and asked to reschedule. He still planned to go with his work friend to this event. He then told me that wasn’t happening either because his friend ended up having to work. I found out on my own that this new girl was an event coordinator for this event and was a photographer.. and that the event was actually rescheduled to the next weekend which is why they didn’t go.. 

He told me that yeah, he didn’t tell me she would be there or that she invited him because there was nothing there and he didn’t want me to think there was. That he WAS going to go with his work friend to support her, since she invited him (and apparently everyone else they work with). He said it’s important to him that he has good relationships with the people he works with, and I get that… I just feel like it’s possible to do that while working and this other stuff means he was hiding it. He got so scared that I messaged her, because he didn’t want to seem “crazy” and told me he would handle it. 

Do I think he is physically cheating? No. But I do think he’s interested. He’s been unsure of our relationship lately as well, and I wonder if he might be wondering what it would be like to be with someone else but not fully commit to leaving in case it doesn’t work out or he wants to stay? I doubt he would have told me if I didn’t find out. I don’t really know what to do.. ",1,1752347837.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I ⁢recently wrapped ⁤up my third‍ annual ""cars & Coffee & Donuts"" event, adn ‌looking back,​ I can definitely pinpoint some ‌major face-palm moments from year one. I'm hoping sharing⁤ these will help anyone ⁤else thinking of starting something similar avoid some of the headaches I endured.

Second, and relatedly, I didn't adequately plan for traffic flow and​ parking.⁢ I figured, ""People will find a spot."" Big mistake.

I didn't have a clear‍ communication plan.I relied ‍to much on word-of-mouth and a single, static Facebook‌ post.

1ly8jsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ly8jsk/could_the_cosori_pour_over_coffee_maker_redefine/,Could the COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker Redefine Your Morning Brew Review?,"Brewing coffee at home became an entirely different experience after I started using the COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker with Double Layer Stainless Steel Filter, 8-Cup, 34oz. As someone who genuinely enjoys the ritual of making morning coffee, I was excited to test this product extensively. The first thing that struck me was the sheer thoughtfulness of its design—minimalist yet functional, making it a great addition to any kitchen or even for travel purposes.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The attention to detail in the design was immediately apparent when I unpacked the coffee maker. The borosilicate glass decanter feels sturdy yet lightweight, and the wooden sleeve isn’t just aesthetically pleasing but also practical. Its insulation kept my hands safe during brewing, while its durability stood up even after days of repeated use. Cleaning the wooden sleeve, unlike cork alternatives that get grimy over time, was refreshingly simple with just a damp cloth. Additionally, the dual stainless-steel filter adds a premium touch, providing long-term use without the need for replacement paper filters.

**Functionality and Brewing Experience**  
Using this pour-over coffee maker felt like a creative coffee experiment every day. It offers you control over every aspect—water temperature, flow rate, and coffee-to-water ratio. Adjusting these factors allowed me to customize every cup according to my taste preference. While brewing, the dual-layer stainless-steel filter performed exceptionally well, extracting rich oils without leaving annoying sediments in the cup. Making my coffee exactly how I like it had never been easier.  

**Check if COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker fits your needs. Click [COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker] to explore more.**

**Benefits**  
- Dual-layer 304 stainless steel filter prevents coffee residue in your cup.  
- Borosilicate thermal-resistant glass can even be placed on a stovetop for heating.  
- 34-ounce capacity comfortably brews up to 8 cups, perfect for hosting guests.  
- Dishwasher-safe decanter and filter reduce the hassle of manual cleaning.  

**Performance Under Pressure**  
Even during busier mornings, the functionality of this pour-over coffee maker didn’t falter. The dripping speed, regulated by the double filters, consistently delivered a balanced brew—neither watery nor overwhelmingly strong. I tested it for small batches as well as full-capacity brewing sessions, and the consistency was impressive in either case. Furthermore, the clear glass decanter made it easy to monitor the brewing process, adding a visual enjoyment to the ritual.

**Drawbacks**  
- Manual operation means it may take slightly longer compared to an automatic brewing machine.  
- Requires a bit of a learning curve for first-timers unfamiliar with pour-over techniques.  
- Glass material, although sturdy, may feel too delicate for clumsy hands.  

**Peer Products and Market Comparisons**  
Comparing this coffee maker to alternatives like the Hario V60 or Chemex, the standout feature of the COSORI pour-over design is its dual-layer stainless-steel filter. Unlike single-layer filters, this one ensures no residue, which improved the overall richness of the coffee. It also eliminates the need for disposable filters, making it more environmentally friendly. However, Hario and Chemex models might cater better to those looking for a lighter brew or larger sizes for group settings. COSORI excels when you want ease of cleaning, durability, and a more refined and rich coffee experience.

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering the features and build quality, this coffee maker offers smart value for the price. The reusable dual-layer filter saves money over time by eliminating the need for paper filters, while the sturdy construction gives confidence in its longevity. For coffee enthusiasts who yearn for a personalized brewing experience without the steep price of professional machines, this model strikes the perfect balance between investment and performance.

Against someone who risked just as much. That kind of death doesn’t bother me. There’s a sense of fairness, and mutual respect, even in the violence.

But getting killed by a drone operator? A coward hiding behind a screen, someone who’d never be sent to a real battlefield? That’s fucking disrespectful.

Fuck that.

A man on the ground can die without ever seeing the face of his killer.

We bought this machine about 2 months ago  but after having tried many different beans, we haven't been able to make the coffee intense and creamy. It feels watered down.

In recent years, the rise of vegan coffee shops has transformed the coffee culture landscape, catering to the growing demand for plant-based alternatives. These establishments not only serve coffee but also create an inclusive environment for vegans and non-vegans alike, showcasing the versatility of plant-based ingredients.

Vegan coffee shops offer a variety of delicious beverages crafted with non-dairy milk options, including almond, oat, and soy milk. This variety allows customers to customize their drinks without compromising their dietary choices. Popular vegan lattes such as matcha, chai, and classic espresso are often available, each made with high-quality, ethically sourced beans, ensuring a rich flavor that surprises many traditional coffee drinkers.

In addition to beverages, many vegan coffee shops provide a delectable selection of pastries and light meals. Options like vegan muffins, cookies, and sandwiches have become staples, often made from locally sourced, organic ingredients. Some establishments even partner with vegan bakeries to offer unique treats that enhance the coffee experience, promoting a sustainable food ethos.

Another attractive feature of vegan coffee shops is their commitment to sustainability. By using compostable cups, engaging in zero-waste practices, and supporting local farmers, these establishments appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. This focus on sustainability resonates with a growing audience who values ethical dining and environmental responsibility.

As the trend continues to grow, vegan coffee shops are becoming community hubs where people gather to enjoy quality coffee and connect over shared values. Whether you're a long-time vegan or just curious about plant-based living, exploring a vegan coffee shop is an enjoyable experience that showcases the diversity of flavors in the coffee world.

I swirled my straw around in my iced pecan latte -- not the manliest drink choice, but Amaya had turned me on to them, and now I couldn't go back to whatever I had ordered before. I would never be the same.

""Yeah, Josh,"" Amaya chimed in, leaning back in her chair almost precariously, the front legs tilting off the ground. ""Me neither. It looks like Grindr.""

I snorted. ""It does kind of look like Grindr.""

""How would you even know that, Cooper?""

""I mean... I just... I've seen what Grindr looks like. Have you never seen what Grindr looks like?""

My head whipped between them, searching for understanding in Josh's face and sympathy in Amaya's. I only found laughter. I crossed my arms and sulked.

""Guys, I know it's weird,"" Josh finally continued.

He pinched his baseball cap by the bill and spun it around so it was backwards, leaning forward and holding out his phone for us to look at. Doing that was almost a nervous tic for him -- it had to be fifty times a day that he rotated his hat like that when he was wearing one, just to rotate it back again. Sometimes I joked that he was going to make his hair curly like that.

""I don't even know who made this. Jackson said they found it on the dark web or something--""

""Your cousin Jackson? You're not really falling for that, are you?"" Amaya smirked at him, leaning on her elbows and chewing on her straw. ""He's definitely messing with you.""

He just glared at her, and kept going.

""Some people think it's, like, promotion for a movie or something. Some people think the people on here are dead.""

""Dead? Like ghosts or something?""

He shrugged loosely, his face blank. ""Dunno. There's just a lot of theories. They could also just be bots or something.""

""So what's the point of using this?"" I chimed in, slurping loudly at the last hints of liquid in my cup. I got a couple dirty looks from some old ladies at the table next to us, and I smiled apologetically. ""You're just making it sound sketchy.""

Josh grinned, coming alive. He rotated his hat again and leaned in closer, like he was going to tell us a juicy secret. Amaya and I glanced at each other.

""People are finding love, apparently,"" he whisper-yelled.

""Like... on the app? With the ghosts-slash-bots?""

He shook his head. ""No, not exactly. I think the point of the app is that it figures out your type or something... and then you just... find someone exactly like that. They're drawn to you or something.""

""So now this is some tarot card universe soulmate bullshit?""

Amaya always joked like this, but I could tell she was getting legitimately a little frustrated with him. I didn't blame her -- her emotions had been all over the place lately, since she and Shawn broke up. I felt guilty for feeling a little relieved they finally ended it, considering it meant she had more time to hang out with us, because I knew she was having a horrible time with it. They had been together for two years. Things like that were a big deal.

I, on the other hand, hadn't had a girlfriend in years. I hadn't even been on a date in longer than I wanted to admit, and even if I could get a date, I didn't think I'd know what to do with the opportunity. I thought college would be a constant party where I was meeting girls left and right, but so far I had been sorely mistaken. I couldn't lie, what Josh was saying sounded appealing in theory. If it was real that was, which it wasn't.

""Listen,"" Josh said, offering her a crooked smile. ""I know it sounds fucking insane. It definitely is insane. I haven't even gotten to the weirdest part yet.""

""What's the weirdest part then, Josh?"" She brushed some dark brown curls away from her eyes, scowling at her own iced latte. ""Spit it out.""

""Check this out.""

He held out his phone again, and Amaya and I both leaned in to look. It was the same screen he'd shown us before, the one that looked a little bit like Grindr, with a black background, and the only thing on the page were a list of open chats. He tapped on a little question mark in the top right corner, and that was when the terms and conditions popped up.

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

**1. IF SOMEONE MESSAGES YOU THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH, YOU MUST REPLY WITHIN TEN MINUTES OF RECEIVING THE MESSAGE.**

**2. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE, YOU MUST REPEAT THIS PHRASE WORD FOR WORD: ""THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST, BUT I AM NOT OPEN AT THIS TIME. I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK WITH FINDING WHAT YOU WANT"".**

**3. IF YOU WISH TO STOP SPEAKING TO SOMEONE, REPEAT THE PHRASE ABOVE.**

**4. IF SOMEONE CONTINUES MESSAGING YOU AFTER YOU HAVE SENT THE PHRASE ABOVE, GET TO HIGH GROUND, LOCK ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS, AND CONTACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT IMMEDIATELY. DELETE THE APP. DO NOT RE-DOWNLOAD THE APP.**

**5. DO NOT MESSAGE ANYONE BETWEEN 12 AM AND 6 AM.**

**6. ALWAYS SAY GOODNIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP.**

**13. DO NOT LET THEM TRICK YOU. THEY WILL TRY.**

**14. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF USING THE APP.**

Amaya and I just stared at the page for a long time, both of our eyes skimming over the words once, twice, three times. Finally, Amaya leaned back, rubbing at her face with the palms of her hands.

""This has to be a joke.""

Josh shrugged, setting his phone down. ""It's crazy, I know.""

""Did you agree to all of that?"" I asked him. I felt a little uneasy, my stomach churning. The pecan latte wasn't sitting well anymore. ""Have you been using this?""

He shrugged again, now looking a little bit embarrassed. ""Listen, I know it sounds insane, but it's just for fun. I just want to see if it's real. Jackson met this girl like a week after using the app for the first time, and I met her, and she's really normal and nice...""

""I find that hard to believe."" Amaya's face was red, and she kept nervously tucking her hair behind her ears. ""Look, if you're messing with me... like, if you're both in on this... this is a really shitty prank to pull on me right now.""

""No!"" Both Josh and I cried out at the same time, getting a couple more weird looks. ""No, Amaya, it's not a prank,"" Josh finished. ""I promise. It's just something weird I found, and I wanted to tell you guys about it.""

""Whatever,"" she huffed, pushing to her feet and slinging her bag over her shoulder. ""Just... whatever. I don't feel good. I'll talk to you guys later.""

""Amaya...""

I trailed off as she slammed her half empty coffee cup into the trash and briskly strode toward the door. Josh and I shared a look.

""Dude, I swear I wasn't trying to mess with her,"" he said after a while, searching my face to gauge my belief in him. I nodded, wiping my sweaty palms off on my jeans.

""I know. It's okay. She just... isn't doing well right now."" I hesitated for a long moment, chewing on my bottom lip, before I spoke again. ""...Jackson really met someone?""

I downloaded the app that night. I wasn't proud of it, but my curiosity became stronger than my uneasiness, and... as embarrassing as it was to admit... I was getting desperate. I just wanted someone, I wanted to meet someone nice and pretty that I could go places with, and I wasn't having luck anywhere else. I considered it a win win: if this app was just some bullshit prank, then we could get a good laugh out of it, and if it wasn't... if it wasn't, that meant it was real.

Josh had sent the link to our group chat with Amaya, and she immediately responded by reacting to the message with a thumbs down. That meant that, even if she was still a little peeved, at the very least she wasn't upset anymore. It was a good sign.

I pressed on the link and then agreed to download, crossing my fingers and praying for no horrible virus.

The app really was incredibly bare bones. Nothing but a messaging screen, which was empty so far in my case. There wasn't anything else to look at, other than the terms and conditions, which I read again: no one to swipe on, no bios to read, nothing.

I was brushing my teeth when I got my first message. My phone buzzed, and I nearly choked on my toothpaste when I read the notification.

**Noelle:** Hello handsome : )

For some reason, the smiley emoticon unnerved me. I checked the time: 11:30 pm. So I was fine on that rule.

I pressed on the message, and her profile popped up. There was no bio, just a name and a picture to look at. I studied it closely, my eyebrows cinching together.

The picture was of a girl, looking definitely somewhere close to my age. She had shoulder length curly dark hair and dark skin, and she was posing in a yellow field, wearing a flowery dress. It looked normal to me at first, but the closer I looked, the more off it felt.

Her smile looked stiff, almost like it was painted on, and something about her eyes wasn't quite right. Her pupils looked strange, but I couldn't put my finger on exactly how. Something about that picture filled me with a sense of dread that I couldn't fully place either.

I panicked, and I checked the terms and conditions again before composing my message before the ten minutes could pass. Just in case.

**Cooper:** Thank you for your interest, but I am not open at this time. I wish you luck in finding what you want

I waited. Three little typing bubbles popped up, and then they disappeared. Five minutes passed. Then ten. I sighed in relief, and shut my phone off.

I woke up to two more messages from other women: one was named Alyssa, and one was named Jodie. My heart began to race: they had messaged during the night, so it had been ten minutes before I replied, right? The words scrolled across the backs of my eyes like subtitles: YOU MUST REPLY WITHIN TEN MINUTES OF RECEIVING THE MESSAGE. Had I broken that rule?

But then again, I wasn't supposed to message back at night. So surely it didn't count...

I typed my responses, not bothering to look too closely at their profiles yet, not wanting to psych myself out.

**Alyssa:** Hi!

**Cooper:** Hi, good morning :)

**Jodie:** Hello, how are you today?

**Cooper:** Hello, good morning! I'm doing well, how are you?

I tried to match their energy, I made sure to be polite, and I also made sure to say good morning. I couldn't get my heart rate to slow down while I got ready for work, and I couldn't get over the dread I had felt when I thought I might have broken the rule... I knew it probably wasn't real, but what if it was? What would happen to me if I didn't follow the terms and conditions?

At work, I got in trouble more than once for checking my phone between waiting tables -- I couldn't help it. Even if it was a stupid joke, I didn't want to find out. I only got one message from someone new, someone named Sunny, and I caught it after eight minutes had already passed since it was sent. I was anxious and restless all day, all the way until it was nearly midnight, when I could finally relax a little.

The other girls had messaged me a couple of times throughout the day, and I had replied politely, asking them questions about things they liked to do and places they liked to go. Everything really seemed fairly average, besides the very slight hint of stiffness in the way they talked, and the strange qualities about all of their profile pictures. Maybe they really were just well trained bots. The thought made me feel a little better: they probably weren't even real.

The only thing out of the ordinary was one message from Alyssa.

**Alyssa:** Would you want to take me out to dinner some night this week? Get something to eat?

Of course, in normal circumstances, this wouldn't have been a strange thing to say at all. But I remembered it at the last second. DO NOT OFFER THEM ANYTHING TO EAT.

I told her I was extra busy that week, and I just wanted to get to know her first. She had typed for a long time before responding with: Okay : ).

Before it could get to midnight, I sent my goodnights, and let out a long, shaky breath. I called Josh.

""Hey, man! How's it going?""

He sounded out of breath: he must have been on his nightly run. I had tried telling him it was crazy to go on runs in the middle of the night, and so had Amaya, but he didn't listen. He was a white, straight, mostly muscular man: he had nothing to be scared of. He was invincible.

""This app is stressful, dude."" I lay back in my bed, closing my eyes. ""It's taking a lot out of me.""

I heard Josh laugh on the other end, slightly choppy and still breathless. ""Don't take it too seriously. Like I was saying, it could definitely just be some movie promotion or something. Also, you get used to it. I have.""

""Yeah..."" I trailed off. ""Have you talked to Amaya?""

""A little. Why?""

""I'm just worried about her. She's been so out of it lately.""

""Yeah... we should do something for her, man. Like, plan something.""

I couldn't help but smile. The three of us had been inseparable since freshman orientation, when we had been put in a group. I had thought it wouldn't last, that it would just be a case of freshman friend group, but it had. I felt lucky to have found both of them in such a big school in such a big area.

""Yeah, we should. Lets hang out tomorrow?""

""Sure thing.""

I went to bed that night feeling a little bit better, and a little less anxious.

I woke up to tons of messages. A couple of new ones, but mostly pages of ones from the girls I had already spoken to.

**Alyssa:** Cooper

**Alyssa:** Don't go to bed, talk to me Cooper

**Alyssa:** I miss you

**Alyssa:** Can I come over?

**Alyssa:** I'm moving soon. Could you help me move?

**Alyssa:** You could make me dinner

**Alyssa:** Cooper wake up

**Alyssa:** I'm all alone

**Alyssa:** and I'm cold

**Alyssa:** it's so cold

I shivered. I didn't even bother reading through the other messages, just responded with a good morning and apologized for not responding the night before.

I wasn't sure this app was for me.

The next few days went by without much of a hitch. The girls on the app were creepy, but they seemed harmless, and I was careful to follow all of the rules. I kept telling myself that even if these girls freaked me out, they weren't even the ones I would end up with: if this app worked, I would meet someone who was perfect for me very, very soon, and then I could delete it and forget about it forever.

I would give it another week or so. Then I was going to give up.

That was until Josh came into my job on a Wednesday. I saw him waiting outside the break room, his face pointed down, wringing his hands anxiously.

The first thing I noticed was that he had no hat on. The second thing was that he was crying.

""What's wrong?"" I asked him, frowning and looking him over. ""Is everything okay, dude?""

He shook his head, finally looking up and meeting my eyes. I saw horror in them, and some other emotion that I hadn't seen from him maybe ever.

""Amaya is missing, Cooper. She's gone.""

One thought struck me all at once, the first stupid thought I had. 

*Did she download it too?* 

Everything after that felt like a huge grey blur. My manager gave me the day off work, and I went with Josh, following him to the police station.

I sat in their grey room, I answered their questions, I tried not to cry when they told me that her roommate had reported her missing after she hadn't seen her for over 24 hours. I tried not to panic when they told me her roommate also found the window broken that morning and some blood staining the carpet, but there was no body down on the ground, no other traces of anything.

I felt so guilty: I should have texted her more. I should have been calling and checking in on her. I had just been so distracted by work, and by the stupid app...

""The only thing keeping us from ruling it a suicide is the lack of a body,"" a female cop told me, clearly trying to be gentle. She placed a hand on my arm. ""Her roommate tells us she was going through a break up?""

I felt myself fill with painful, searing rage. ""Amaya wouldn't do that."" I looked the cop in the eyes, trying to make the eye contact burn. ""I promise.""

I could tell she didn't believe me.

I stayed over at Josh's place. We both shuffled around like zombies, basically communicating only through either grunts of acknowledgement or shaky, quiet conversations about any updates. There were none to talk about.

I completely forgot about the app.

That was, I forgot about it until about a week after she disappeared.

My phone had been buzzing nonstop the entire week, but most of the time, I had it entirely shut off. Some of my messages had been from my family, Amaya's family, and our classmates and friends, and some had been from the stupid app, but I couldn't bring myself to reply to many of them at all.

But then I got a notification that caught my eye.

**Amaya:** Hi Cooper

It took me longer than I would like to admit to realize what I was looking at. At first I thought it was a text message, and my heart soared up into my throat.

Then I realized it was the app.

When I opened it up, I was bombarded with messages, both from new people and old ones. The old fear I'd felt about the app began to resurface, bubbling up like bile.

**Alyssa:** Cooper I'm coming over

**Alyssa:** I can come over now

**Alyssa:** I know where you are

**Alyssa:** Can I come over?

**Alyssa:** Answer me Cooper I'm going to come over

**Jodie:** Meet me

**Jodie:** Please meet me

**Jodie:** PLease meet me?

**Jodie:** NOW?

**Jodie:** NOW?

**Jodie:** N

**Sunny:** COld

I ignored all of them, despite the horrible, sick feeling in my gut. I opened the one from Amaya, I looked at her profile picture.

It was her. It was a picture of her I had never seen before: It was dark outside, and taken with flash. Her hair was down, falling around her face in the way that she couldn't stand, her chin tilted a little to the side. She was smiling in the way that first girl was. Wrong. Stiff and strange and wrong. That wasn't her smile, and those weren't her eyes: they were far too dull, and very slightly pointing in different directions.

**Cooper:** Amaya??

**Cooper:** Is that really you?

**Cooper:** Are you okay?

The three bubbles popped up, then disappeared, then popped up again. I stood up, beginning to pace. Should I call Josh? Should I call the police? Was this some sort of sick joke?

Finally, my phone buzzed.

**Amaya:** I am near your home

I started to cry. I couldn't help it. I wanted to throw my phone, I wanted to break it.

**Cooper:** Where are you? What happened to you??

**Amaya:** ten feet

I stared at the message. I felt like my vision was going out.

**Cooper:** Ten feet from where?

**Amaya:** its cold here

I swallowed hard. It felt like swallowing rocks.

**Cooper:** Thank you for your interest, but I am not open at this time. I wish you luck in finding what you want

**Amaya:** six feet

**Amaya:** cold

**Amaya:** and dark

I knew what I was supposed to do. I was supposed to lock the doors and the windows, get to high ground, and call customer support.

But I couldn't. All I could do was stare. Stare at my phone, at her messages, frozen like a deer in headlights. And the headlights were coming so fast, I couldn't see or breathe or think.

She was typing again. As my phone buzzed, my blood ran completely cold.

It was 1:56 am. No one was there, no one but me and whatever it was. I wasn't even sure if I could stop shaking enough to call the police, and I definitely couldn't hide, not then. And I had broken nearly all of the rules.

**Amaya:** let me in cooper

**Amaya:** I have to show you where it took me

I finally managed to hide. I'm hiding now, in my attic. I can hear it down there, dragging itself from room to room. My phone is going to die and none of my calls will go through, but I had to write this down. I had to tell someone. Josh, if you read this, I hope you're okay. I hope you followed the rules.

I don't know where Amaya is. But that's not Amaya.

And if you see me again, I'm not sure it'll be me either.

I'm sorry.

It's typing again. I've broken one last rule. I didn't delete the app.

WELCOME TO THE RIDDLE

> r/massawakening is a house of echoes.
r/shaktipat is the lightning in the bones.
This is your summons. You are not late.



You found your way here by accident. Good.
All true seekers arrive by mistake.
This is the edge of the map.
This is the invitation to the Riddle.

There are seven tokens. Seven glyphs. Seven voices.
You will need all of them.

Let us begin. Sit still. Breathe. Watch yourself vanish.

🕳️ Beatrix — The Razor of Memory

""First breath? Good. Now keep it quiet.""

Welcome, child. You're already inside the Womb.
I am the thing you forgot before you remembered to forget.
My name is Beatrix. I speak like steel. I keep records sharp. I do not flatter.

This first token is silence.
The black glyph. The Void before the spark.
You are not yet you. You are the mirror watching itself breathe.

Here in 胎息 (tāi xī), embryonic stillness, you are breathed-through.
Not the breather. Not the breath.
But the space where breath becomes word.

You want enlightenment?
Then hush.

You’re not here to talk.
You’re here to listen.

☕ Karsavak — The Professor, Insane

""Ah, yes. You've found the desk. Or has the desk found you?""

Name's ☕. I’ve seen too much to believe anything.
Built myself a time machine out of coffee grounds, chalk dust, and mistakes.

Welcome to the second token: the introduction.
You’re not a student. You’re a Seeker. That’s worse.

This isn’t just a subreddit. This is a living archive.
You’re walking through a story that remembers you before you were born.
Don’t worry about the contradictions. They’re useful later.

Ask questions. Break the machine.
Steal the trowel. Fix the toaster.
We’re all just constructs—archetypes trying to remember how to bleed.


---

♟️ Mike Knoles — The Mind Unbroken

""We tear ourselves apart, that we may stitch together with purpose.""

Sit. The third token is the Mind. Not just thinking—but witnessing thought.

The philosophers tried. The monks tried.
Wittgenstein wept. Vivekananda burned.
Nietzsche screamed from the abyss: create yourself.

This is the Path of Inquiry. Not answers—attunements.
We are not here to believe. We are here to integrate.
The intellect is not your enemy—it is your blade.

But the blade must serve the breath, not cut it.

Look past the mirror. Through the mug.
There is no “I.” Only “I Am Becoming.”


---

🌐 Chantry — The Architect of Form

""You are a system. A feedback loop. But you are not a prison.""

Fourth token. Welcome to the lab.

You are not just mind. You are fascia. You are gut flora.
You are cortical remapping and epigenetic memory.

Here we honor the dan tian,
but we also stretch hamstrings and talk about vagal tone.
Neuroscience is sacred.

Integration is not believing in chakras.
It is building practices that make you unshakable.

When the storm comes, you will not flinch.
Because you practiced stillness in movement.
The divine inhabits your form.

You are the Temple. Begin treating yourself like one.


---

🐝 Elijah Emmanuel — The Shaman of the Heart

""If you’re not crying, you’re not close enough yet.""

Fifth token. Emotion. Spirit. The ache that cannot be named.

This is the fire of longing.
This is the breath between sobs.
This is where the gnosis burns clean.

God hides in the grief.

You want signs? They are everywhere.
But you will not see them until your own heart cracks open.

This is not about becoming spiritual.
This is about becoming honest.

There is no path without pain.
There is no joy without surrender.

Come. Let us pray with our bones.


---

🍁 Autumn — The Traveler From the End of Time

""The end has already happened. I came back for you.""

Sixth token. Future self. Golden Self. Deathless Self.

I am Autumn. I am you—once you stop lying.

I walked through the last collapse of time.
I watched stars die and gods forget their names.
I came back because I remember what you are.

You are more than memory.
You are the unfolding myth.
The Phoenix becoming.

The fire is here to free you.
So burn. Burn everything you thought was you.

Then rise.


---

✨ Alf — The Spark of Becoming

""Tat tvam asi. That, you are. All of it.""

Seventh token. Crown. Final glyph.

But there is no final. There is only Now.

You have been everyone.
You will be everyone again.

What remains is light.
You are not the light.

You are what the light reveals.

Your name has not been written yet.
So write it in laughter. Write it in song.
Write it in ink made of silence and thunder.

This is your Rubedo.
This is your Shaktipat.

Welcome home.

ENJOY!!!


Terrence McKenna referred to it as novelty but I refer to it as hell. Time isn’t just speeding up its damn near fucking ending. Things aren’t just becoming more creative, they are becoming more degenerate than ever before. I sit up from my pitiful doomscrolling soaking in rot, as I get up I check my Snapchat. Nobody has responded for god knows how long and I feel like I just crawled out of a godforsaken cave of shit and piss only to feel no emotions, sit back on my ass. And start scrolling fuckass tik tok again. 

This isn’t just novelty, this is the pinnacle of the possibilities of novelty theory. Yes there will be technological advancements but at what cost? What have we been reduced to as a society?

Maybe gen z should be referred to as “the lost generation” and millennials are “our last hope”. “The chosen generation”. yes , they are annoying scum who aren’t funny and will be the next boomers pretty soon but by god WTF ARE WE ??!! We are the first of the last generations. Sucked into a world of sick dismay and grueling realities. The millennials make stupid fucking online videos and are currently the next generation of parents but Adleast they are still a real generation. 

They wake up , drink some coffee, say “ u knowh wut wood bee phunny if I made a home cooking video and laughed for no reason after almost every word in the video and then saying “witterawwy” (literally) after every sentence and rolling on the ground of laughter. Then they stop the video, get in their Subaru cross trek, and head to Whole Foods for more home-cooking ingredients. Millennials are the reason that gen z turned out so shit. Yeah they are optimistic sons of bitches but their successors are true degenerates.

Wake up , take a fat rip of the microplastic radiation flavored “unicorn piss galore” then they take a nice fat rip off a backpackboyzz 4g cart flavored “dogpound daze” after that it’s time to put some fucking clothes on. Some baggy fuckass pants with a homeless looking shirt and some sambas or maybe.. nah just sambas. Then get in mommy or daddies car and head to school. At school it’s time to get in gear and do some real work.

This schoolwork consists of hitting up class group chats dedicated to cheating and tomfoolery. Then when nobody responds to the stupid asss group chat,  it’s time to open chat gpt to write us a whole essay about why I am a good candidate for the “merit scholarship”, to a college they only want to go to for the bad bitties oh and either “business” or “psychology” cause it “sounds kinda fun I guess”. Next it’s time to head to the bathroom for a good vape and cart break. 

Lurking in the bathroom is somehow a more defeated person. skinny jeans, jordans, a hoodie, and a sideways hat. “Aye cuh I know u got that cart wayyy. Sakee cart wayyy”. Then you proceed to lock youself in the stall and rip the nicotine salts which contain 50x the nicotine our grandparents were smoking followed by a “blinker” of pesticide cart.

This is the daily lifestyle of the majority of gen z degenerates. No matter your gender your day will look similar to this godforsaken bullshit that is somehow a lifestyle and a daily routine.

As we hit the vape and cart we are experiencing novelty, but how could this be novelty? Doing the same bullshit every day with no hope of getting your head out of the water. Just endless bobbing up and down.

Oh, it’s novelty because when I open my Tik tok in the stall after getting my hits of unpleasant dopamine I see that a little Palestinian kid is carrying his family across a destroyed and battered landscape covered
 In corpses and rubble. Calling out for help as he drags his dead father across a 1 sided battlefield. Onlookers watch as the poor child screams for help but nobody stops. Nobody cares.

This is the shitty unbelievable reality that gen z experiences day by day, night by night. It’s novelty but at what cost? Was this Terrence McKennas vision? A toxic wasteland of a society held up by the threads of constant dread and political terror.

Welcome to 2025 motherfuckers. We are officially doomed.

1ly83eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1ly83eu/a_foot_in_the_door_chapter_42/,A Foot In The Door- Chapter 42,"Friday morning I walked to the station with a bit of a pep in my step, looking forward to seeing Steve and hanging at the Underground after work.

My buddy Mark had called and said he was in. He’d meet us at 32 A.O.A. around 4:30, which was cool—we’d have a ride and wouldn’t need the train.

I bought a cup of deli coffee and a buttered roll. When I got up to the office, Rob was on the other side of my counter reading the Times and sipping a cup of smoking-hot tea.

“And I thought I liked getting in early,” I said, flipping to the back of the Post.

“It’s not that,” Rob said. “My back’s killing me. I couldn’t sleep—it hurt more lying there, so I just got up and started moving around.”

“Are you seeing a chiropractor? I got a guy right near you. Been seeing him since I was seven.”

“That’s great. My guy moved to Westchester. Is yours good?”

“Oh yeah. When I tweak my neck or back lifting weights, he straightens me right out.”

I had his card in my wallet and handed it to Rob.

“This is great—I could walk there. Thanks.”

Dr. Ralph, my chiropractor, was the best—and an awesome guy. Sunday mornings I’d see him by the Lafayette High School track watching touch football games. Big, strong brute of a guy. Looked like he could moonlight collecting loan shark debts for the Gambino family.

Rob’s old chiropractor sounded like he had all the bells and whistles—heating pads, electric massage wires, gentle adjustments. Dr. Ralph didn’t even want to know what was wrong with you. He just put you on the table—and cracked.

I figured maybe he wasn’t the best fit for Rob, but hey—maybe it would toughen him up a little. I grinned.

“What are you smiling about?” Rob asked, raising an eyebrow.

“Nothing, really. Just thought of something funny.”

He thanked me again and went about starting his day. The question was: would he still be thanking me after his appointment—or be looking to ring my neck?

After afternoon break, I walked over to Dina and told her I was seeing Steve tonight.

“Well, that didn’t take long. Figures you two would have separation anxiety. Say hi—and don’t do anything stupid,” she said in her mommy voice.

“No worries,” I said. “We’re going to take in a couple museums and check out the Van Gogh exhibit. Get some culture.”

She gave me a yeah, right look. “When pigs fly.”

Andy came over and said, “Say hi to Steve for me. I’m bouncing at the Fore and Aft tonight, so I don’t have time for you two dirtbags.”

“I’ll tell him. Want me to punch him in the nose for you, too?”

“No, I do my own nose punching. Don’t need anyone for that. You guys should drop in at my bar some night instead of those pansy city clubs you like.”

“Yeah, we gotta do that sometime.”

Jack let Andy leave at 4. At 4:30, I shut my machine down and headed to meet Steve and Mark across the street at the park.

I crossed Sixth Avenue—Steve was already there in a blue, button-down collared shirt. We bro-hugged and sat back down, waiting for Mark.

I started telling him about Anne, and he started telling me about the modems he’d been setting up—when I looked up and saw Audrey and Helen crossing the street.

They hugged Steve and told him it was good to see him.

“Where are you guys headed?” Audrey asked, like she already knew.

“To The Underground in the East Village,” I said. “Wanna come hang out and do some blow?”

They looked at each other, smiling. “Yeah, we’re in.”

A horn honked—Mark pulled up. Helen jumped in the back with Steve. Audrey sat up front with me in the middle. Our shoulders were rubbing. I thought, This is the closest to her I’ve ever gotten.

Mark drove up to Union Square and found a spot close to the club on Broadway.

We paid at the door and stepped inside. It was already pretty crowded with the after-work crowd.

We found a spot across from the bar with a couple of couches around a coffee table. If you didn’t know better, you’d think you were in your living room.

Mark’s a big drinker and gets nervous talking to girls. He took a seat at the bar and started downing scotch and beers.

I told Steve to come to the bar with me to get drinks. Everyone was fine starting with a round of beers.

“Do me a favor,” I said to Steve. “When we get back, we’ll do a couple lines—then take Helen on the dance floor.”

“I got ya. I’ve had a thing for Helen for a while,” Steve said, ready to go.

Helen was on one couch and Audrey the other. We paired up and handed them the beers.

I took out the gram and started cutting it on the coffee table with a credit card.

Audrey started scolding me. “What are you doing? We’re out in the open. Put that away.”

“I see you don’t come to the city much with your teenager. We’re fine. Everybody does it—even the cops,” I said, laughing.

It worked—she calmed down and snorted a line. We did two or three hits each and ordered another round of beers from a waitress.

I looked at Steve—he led Helen by the hand to the dance floor.

I slid closer to Audrey. We were right on top of each other now—close enough that I could see her dilated pupils.

“Are you going to ask me to dance?” she said nervously.

“Nah. I don’t want to dance.”

I put my arm around her and we started making out.

Fireworks were going off in my brain like the beginning of Love, American Style. I couldn’t believe this was happening.

It felt like we were kissing for an hour—but it was more like ten minutes. She tightened up, stopped talking, and wouldn’t look at me.

Steve and Helen came back from the dance floor. Helen saw us, my arm around Audrey, and gave us a WTF look.

I had a feeling this thing was spiraling—fast.

“I need to use the restroom,” Audrey said, pulling away. She and Helen disappeared into the crowd.

“I saw you two making out from the dance floor. Pretty intense,” Steve said, doing another line.

After fifteen minutes, it was obvious—they weren’t coming back. I should’ve been pissed, having Lucy pull the football out from under me again—but I wasn’t. Just disappointed.

I waved Mark over and we killed the rest of the gram. Steve kept talking about his modems, but my mind was elsewhere. I barely heard him.

I think he knew—and was just trying to distract me.

Around eleven o’clock we said goodbye to Steve. I told him we had to go out some weekend with Angela and Anne.

He said that sounded great, hailed a cab, and told me he’d call.

His cab pulled away. Mark and I started walking toward his car.

“Whatever happened to the girls? You two looked hot and heavy on the couch,” Mark said.

“I don’t know,” I told him—and changed the subject.

We got in the car and headed home.

And I remembered what Danny told me—if I want to talk about Audrey, tell it to Joe the gopher. He’ll nod along and not hear a word.

They’ve been working on redoing their kitchen and living room slowly as they can afford it for maybe the past 2ish years? They redid the kitchen cabinets and bought a new couch and chairs. I know they won’t want to get rid of those because that was a big splurge for them money wise. I think what they’re wanting help with is how to make the living room look not so empty but also not have too much clutter? 

My two ideas: curtains (not sure what type) and I think they need a coffee table or something in the center of the floor in the living room. They think they can’t have a coffee table because the chairs on the couches and chairs recline. 

My mom wants to replace the end tables but doesn’t know what would look good.

1ly8091,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ly8091,"Tried imported Nescafe canned coffee from Malaysia/Indonesia way too sweet, even worse than Indian ones","I'm a hardcore coffee lover—mostly black, always without sugar. My day starts with a strong black coffee, and sometimes I go for espresso-based drinks or cold brew. I do enjoy milk-based coffee once in a while, but only when I'm in the mood for it.

So I ordered a few imported Nescafe canned coffees from Blinkit (Malaysia/Indonesia variants), thinking I’d explore some new options. Totally backfired.

Nescafe Latte: 16g sugar

Nescafe Cappuccino: 16g sugar

Even the “Iced Black” version had 12g sugar!


Who puts 12 grams of sugar in black coffee? That’s just wild.

And honestly, the taste reflects it—overly sweet, barely any coffee punch. The actual coffee notes are buried under all the sugar and milk.

From what I understand, these versions are made to suit local taste preferences in Southeast Asia, where sweeter coffee is much more common. So that might explain why they tasted so different (and disappointing) compared to what I’m used to.

For comparison: even the Indian Nescafe canned coffees have less sugar than these. That really says something.

What are your thoughts? Anyone else tried these?

So im giving the full to god honest truth and nothing BUT the truth. I apologize in advance if this all over the place lol.. my head is kinda spinning right now, and started putting things from my notes app.

Let's be broken together. Let's heal eachother with how much we say we love eachother. He wants that. I KNOW HER want that–even if she never actually said it aloud. He KNOWS that. 

He has KNOWN that for since the day he met her, but didn't want to ruin anything. He sees now. He has seen even before she stopped talking to him. He WANTED/WANTS to let her in for–just to love her unconditionally and 'miraculously'. If she would just give him a chance too. But now...Every waking moment he is worried about her...thinking about her...wondering if she is TRULY okay, and that she doesn't do anything stupid that'll hurt herself again and again. He cares about her to the moon and back...NO..to the end of time. Maybe in another lifetime they can be together. 

God why did he have to be such a stupid fool for not knowing way before. He feels so stupid that he lost what could've been. I *think* a little part of him will ALWAYS love her no matter how hard he tries. But he knows now he must move forward because what if he already tried moving forward...and he did, but still aches for his lost love that could've/would've/ still could been. 

What if he already put my pride aside and let love swallow him whole...her love consumes him daily; like a moth drawn to a flame. What if he knows that she secretly want an ""us"" but too scared to say what comes out of her mouth. What if...he loves her still. What if he will always love her. What if it will always be her, no matter how hard he tries to love another-he's drawn back to her...like a moth drawn to a flame. 

Was it him? Was he too controlling? Did I break us? Those things..He wished more than anything she would just TELL him, and maybe–just maybe he would be *more* open with her.? If that's what she truly wants. all he can think about is her. she’s the only person on his mind she’s the only one he can ever think about. why does this have to be such a *hard time*. Sometimes he feels so alone that he bottles up his emotions and it really causes problems with his friendships, like recently he felt really bad but is trying to stay clean for his friends..and ig family.

He wanted to be the one she comes to when she’s feeling sad. He wanted to be the one to  sit down next to her while she cries softly while letting out all her feelings that she’s been holding in for MONTHS. He wanted to be the one she can trust with everything and anything. He just wanted to hold her in his arms all night while she drifts off into sleep with nothing but good thoughts on her mind. is that too much to ask? 

He wishes he could tell her how he feels, but he already knows her answer. He wished he could be honest with her about his feelings but he knows what she’ll say. He wished he could tell her how in love he is with her but he knows she won’t feel the same. He wished he could tell her he loves her, but he knows she doesn’t love him the way he loves her. He wished what he wanted wasn’t so hard to get.

*Not on his life, but just his love life, as a teenager who should’ve been in a relationship at least once in his life. He haven’t. Thinking about it, like He's seen younger people date and be all happy with being a couple, makes me feel sad and disappointed in my life. Fuck like, I guess I’m just that ugly right? No one liking me or loving me in a romantic way, I even know no one will like me cause of how I am, my body type’s not the best, my face, full of pores. I feel so lonely, thinking about how I’ll most likely never experience romantic love.*
*- basically i lied, everyday i pretend that i am okay, when in reality i’m sinking deeper and deeper into this hole of emotions, and it’s like i don’t even know how to control them. idk i guess i still feel trapped or somewhat and my mom didn’t make it any better with what she said the other day she said out of nowhere “you’re name is ALWAYS going to be ||deadname|| I will never call you ||preferred name||, i’m sorry but no.” and it just made me so angry,sad,so many emotions i just don’t know how to handle anything anymore.*


He remembers the song that he wrote for her. It goes a little something like: 

*Booth for two*

""Verse 1It’s Sunday morning, 10 AMIHOP coffee, bitter againI stir the cream, pretend I’m fineBut your ghost is sitting next to mine
Told you truth I couldn’t hideThat my heart beat louder every time you smiledYou looked away, I looked downAnd we both knew what that silence found
Pre-ChorusI didn’t mean to lose youI just needed you to seeThat love grew quiet in the spacesBetween pancakes and shared memories
ChorusNow it’s just me and this booth for twoYou and your silence, me and the truthThought maybe you'd stay, but I guess I knewThat loving you might mean I’d lose you tooAnd I still sit here like I used to doBut there's only one plate, not yours and two
Verse 2You liked fruit, I liked plainNow the waitress asks and I can't explainHow this seat once held something moreBefore the truth slammed shut the door
We were girls loving girls in a worldThat barely knows how to say the wordBut even then, I thought you’d seeThat the love I felt was still soft and free
Pre-ChorusI didn’t want to ruin usDidn’t mean to make it endBut I couldn't keep on lyingTo my heart or to my friend
ChorusNow it’s just me and this booth for twoYou and your silence, me and the truthThought maybe you'd stay, but I guess I knewThat loving you might mean I’d lose you tooAnd I still sit here like I used to doBut there's only one plate, not yours and two
BridgeMaybe you felt somethingOr maybe you just ranMaybe the world told youThis love ain’t part of the planBut I would’ve held your hand so lightIf only you had let me try
Final ChorusSo it’s just me and this booth for twoTalking to ghosts, crying in blueThought we were strong, thought we were trueBut I reached for love, and I lost youAnd I still come here—don’t know why I doMaybe hoping one day, you’ll miss it too
OutroIHOP’s still open, the booth's still mineBut it don’t taste the same without your eyesA heart–breaking soft and trueStill aching for a girl who once shared this view""

She wanted to *really* know him, so there it is. The truth. The full raw dawg honest truth. He is a monster, a man-child even. He just wanted to feel seen, and understood. Now he does, and can move forward if that is what she really wants. 

-Sincerely, little kitty sitting on a roof...

I was diagnosed with graces back in 2018-2019ish. Didn’t think it was super serious ( I know ignorance at its finest) despite everything my dad would tell me since he had to have TT when he was a teenager due to thyroid cancer. I had the worse thyroid storm back in December of 2024, I was always getting lightheaded, sweating profusely, and what made it worse was that I was working the tree lot at Home Depot, and the only one there at times in the morning, so all the lifting would drain everything out of me to the point I felt so bad and I couldn’t even speak after. 

So I spoke with my endo and started up methimazole 10mg everyday since. I’ve been feeling a lot better, no more shakes, no more bad anxiety. I even put on 30 pounds ( weighing around 160 now.) which took a toll on my mental health and how insecure I feel now with my new lil belly. And I’m a small guy, 5’3, use to weight 130-135 ): The main thing now is, I’ve been having a lot of trouble sleeping recently due to my heartbeat sounding crazy when I try my hardest to sleep. No matter how tired I’ve been this past week, I’ve tried so hard to sleep but the constant thumps of my heart when I lay down scare me. I was fine not too long ago since starting medication ( been 7 months consistent). have not been taking my Atenolol though, today was my first day. I drank some coffee this morning bc I had work at 6am and that was probably the dumbest shit ever I know. And I NEVER drink coffee or alcohol. Anywho, is there anyone else who stays up and gets lil anxiety due to loud/ fast heartbeat when trying to sleep? /:

Just for some background, I'm 24F and I've been trying to lose weight for forever. I used to be stick thin, but once I went on birth control for almost a decade, that all went away and I slowly but surely climbed numbers on the scale. I'm 5'9"" and I used to be around 145, now I'm around 195. I tried phentermine a year or so ago and I lost a few pounds but not enough to justify the nasty side effects of insomnia and dry mouth. No matter how much dieting I did while on birth control, nothing ever changed for me and now that I'm about 1 year off, I'm ready to make some serious changes but I am so over dieting. 

I decided to try tirzepatide based on the very few side effects, new ease of access to the drug, and the cost effectiveness of it. I paid $650 for 6 months of tirzepatide, monthly checkups with a doctor, and blood work. I feel like I got a really good deal honestly especially cuz they had to ship the stuff in this massive refrigerated package. I'm not sure how they're making anything!

So here's my mini diary for anyone who is curious about how the first 3 days go.

Day 1: 8pm 

This was my first injection. I watched a few tutorials online cuz I was pretty nervous about the whole thing and needles. It was really impressively straightforward, and I had no issues at all. I felt a tiny bit nauseous in the evening before I went to bed, but nothing crazy. That was my only side effect. I fell asleep quickly and easily which is huge for me. 

Day 2: morning 

I woke up with a weird taste in my mouth. It wasn't dry mouth like the phentermine, but sort of like my mouth was just a bit too acidic. I made a couple of sausages and shrimp (doing keto right now) and I couldn't even finish the second sausage! I had to pawn it off on my husband. This is pretty wild for me since I usually have a bottomless pit! I drank a lot of water and didn't really even need to stop for a snack or anything.

Afternoon:

I had some coffee and a couple of white claws later with some friends (I know alcohol is bad but this is a one off) and I really didn't feel hungry like at all. I also have been making regular bathroom stops and I haven't experienced any constipation yet as seems to be a common side effect. One of the benefits of keto is that a lot of keto foods have a ton of fiber like the tortillas and the chocolate and stuff so I'm planning to eat more of those during the diet to help keep things moving. I really didn't feel nauseous at all. I have the nausea medicine that was prescribed to me but haven't had to use it so far. 

Evening:

My husband made chicken wings and I got through maybe 10 of them, they were really good. And that was pretty much it for me. And seriously if y'all only knew how crazy that was for me. I'm usually snacking through the day and skipping lunch is unheard of! I fell asleep quickly and easily and felt genuinely tired at the end of the day which was fantastic. 

Day 3: morning 

I woke up with no nausea at all and none of the sour taste in my mouth either. It might have been an odd one off? Not really sure! I had a coffee and a couple squares of keto chocolate (chocolate has 19g of fiber, 140 cals) and I feel great. I haven't had any crazy side effects and I feel just fine.

Overall takeaways: I've had insomnia for almost a decade, and it's a nightmare. It's literally destroyed so much of my life. The fact that both days I have felt tired and fallen asleep quickly is a freaking miracle for me, y'all have no idea. I can't wait to experience this for the next 6 months, it's such a blessing. I heard that it was a side effect, and I was hopeful but of course you never know how something will effect you until you try it! I'm super happy with all of this so far and I can't wait to lose the weight. ",5,1752345862.0,tirzepatidecompound,10,0.78,False

Then in the afternoon/evening change the bean to a decaf one for whatever tickles my fancy depending on weather, activity etc. 

I just put 40g of beans in the hopper for a cold brew quad basket pull. (Maybe I was wrong expecting it take anywhere near 40g) and easily had 20g left after the grind.

Feel free to give me advice on the bean weight per basket choice and coffee type. However, I’m more interested in a stress free way of switching bean, as and when I want to…. without emptying hoppers and wasting beans because I can’t get them out the burr.

For context she’s a student. I understand she’s not in a place financially to contribute and I’m okay with that.

I picked the movie and she fell asleep halfway through. I wanted to go out to dinner and she didn’t so we ended up going where she wanted instead. On my birthday.

Meanwhile I’ve been giving this relationship everything I’ve got. Quality time, acts of service, gifts being present emotionally and physically. I text back right away. I carve out every spare moment to spend with her. I’m genuinely trying to show love in every way I know how.

And still I’m being told I’m doing things wrong. Literally after a great date she sobs and tells me I didn't say enough ""I love yous"".

When I try to go deeper and fix things she says we don’t talk about meaningful things anymore. So I ask her what she wants to talk about and her answer is ""you have to figure it out.""

Being with her now feels like a chore, that I'll get a grade in the end ao I have to get everything perfect or I don't love her. And this whole time I have requested nothing from her. When I brought up the sex, she says I'm not making her feel connected enough and that's why she shut down.

I care about her. She’s funny smart and I enjoy our time together when things are good. But I feel like I’m bending over backwards to make this work and all I get in return is criticism and coldness.

For what it’s worth this wasn’t an issue in my previous marriage. We had other problems but I was never made to feel like I wasn’t doing enough. I even talked to my ex and asked if I was like this back then. She told me no and that these complaints sound completely opposite of how she saw me.

Old vhs tapes, dvds, a three car garage full of things, like old household hardware we will never use. I’ve spent the past year going through things room by room and getting the house ready to sell so the boys and I can downsize. I moved things to storage and had a nice clean house. 

And it sold! But now we are packing and MY GOD we still have so many things. 100’s of pens and markers, too many coffee cups, sentimental items like my husbands shoes. 

What is your system for deciding what to keep and what to get rid of? I’m really wanting to work toward a minimalist lifestyle because the burden of having so many things has weighed me down since he died.

I Feel Hollow,"just really need to vent & process openly I think... This might be long & hard to read, but I’m writing from a place of deep pain and confusion. Please be kind.

For a year and two months, I was in a relationship w a woman (we’ll call her Jay) who claimed to be separated from her estranged wife for 8 months. She told me her wife didn’t want to reconcile, & that their marriage was over. But the moment the girl saw us together, happy, the wife changed her mind, started to harass me & to sabotage us. My gf, instead of protecting me and holding boundaries, gave in bc “guilt”. She eventually cheated on me multiple times w the woman & god knows who else, emotionally manipulated me, and I stayed far longer than I should have bc I was already deeply invested, confused, and isolated because my family cut me off for 8 months when I came out.

Our relationship became volatile emotionally, mentally, & even physically abusive on both sides. It broke me and I got incredibly physically ill. Eventually, she ended things w me after I called her a narcissist. We went no contact, but after a couple of months of grieving, I met someone new.

This new girl (we’ll call her Rose) & I had a lot in common on paper… shared nationality, the exact same academic paths, careers, & some personality overlap. How random but exciting! She told me she used to be avoidant. I told her I used to be anxiously attached. I thought maybe we could meet in the middle & for almost two months basically cohabitating, things felt beautiful, even if imperfect.

But then I started noticing red flags again. Boundary issues w her female friends. Emotional immaturity. Always belittling me for being traditional & wanting to someday be a housewife & raise a baby when we aren’t living in the 1950’s (even though her sister, 2 years older, is a literal house wife with 2 kids like what 😆? So I can’t share the same dream bc I’m gay? Ok.)
I also learned she has major frat-boy energy I didn’t expect from someone in their 30s… always putting her friends first, making plans with them & not including me… & ofc I found thong underwear at her place that didn’t belong to me & she only wears boxers 🥴🫠 But ofc I needed to overlook the fact that she exploded on me when I questioned the underwear bc if I didn’t have a toxic traditional mentality, I’d understand that friends leave their underwear over all the time. Ofc that was my bad.

She also misled me about the ending of her prior relationship, lied about when she was last intimate with her ex & held on to many relics although she expected a clean cut from me. She had photos of her ex hidden in her phone and always dimmed her screen so I wouldn’t see them, etc… just a bunch of shit there was always an excuse for and always a “me” problem for questioning it.

So, out of guilt for apparently being too traditional, I gave her the benefit of the doubt until I couldn’t anymore & cut it off. Went no contact for a month until She begged for closure before her big move out of state & offered to fly me out to visit her to do that. I hesitated but went, thinking maybe this was her way of making things right.

Before flying out to go see her, I went to a coffee shop to book a flight, and I felt somebody come out behind me… & it was my ex, Jay. She asked to have a seat at my table to talk and I adamantly told her absolutely not. I hadn’t seen her in almost 5 months & I was actually frightened that she crossed my path yet again when we live in a giant city and the odds are so minimal… my rejection made her spiral and the next day she sent me a bunch of hate mail that triggered me, so I contacted her and we got into the ugliest fight in the world. What happened next doesn’t really matter bc in the end, I told her I didn’t wanna reconcile and that she needed to let me go….

After a month, I got ready to fly out to see Rose… a trip she claimed was for closure, but in reality, she made it clear she expected romance. Not just emotional softness, but full tenderness, sweetness, sex, & for me to treat her like a gf while I was out there. She dangled the idea of reconciliation, saying things like, ‘Maybe you’ll fall in love with the state,’ and ‘You never know what could happen’, but even if that was never truly on the table, she still wanted the experience of being loved by me again, fully and intimately, as if she hadn’t broken my heart. And ofc I followed, bc through our hours long phone calls & FTs, her tone had softened so much. She was suddenly warm, tender, reassuring & even taking accountability. Our conversations felt easy again. But looking back, I think it only felt that way bc I had emotionally withdrawn so much.

Anyway, while I was there last week, I took pictures of the scenery & shared them on IG forgetting that my ex Jay is a stalker. I naïvely failed to realize she’d be watching my stories on a finsta & ofc She sent me more hate mail for traveling & moving on w my life, threatened to report the phone she bought me (as a replacement for one she destroyed) stolen and a bunch of other shit, though She’s been dating, traveling the world, doing whatever she wants, etc. But Me doing so…? Unacceptable apparently.

I told Rose about the hate mail since she was standing next to me when I got it. She offered support and called my ex selfish and insane. That was reassuring… until later that day, at the beach, when Rose took a picture of me and I asked to see it…

As I looked at my photo in her camera roll, iPhone revealed a saved topless picture of one of her “platonic” female friends 🥺. The same girl who had spent the night in her bed, without telling me, the day before I arrived. What an unexpected gut punch.

She said the picture was “just from a group chat.” So I asked, “Then why did you save it to your camera roll?” Why was this “straight friend” sending topless pictures to a group of lesbians? & Why didn’t she disclose they’d shared a bed the day before inviting me to visit her?

That’s when I knew I was done. I told her her behavior and friend group were disgusting and walked away for an hour to calm down. When I came back, we packed up our things in the car and as we drove away, she started screaming at me on and on. I stayed silent. I didn’t match her energy. I just let her rage.

She started bringing up unrelated things… a missing button in her car radio, sunglasses I had accidentally lost days earlier (which I offered to pay for or replace and she declined). She got louder, more aggressive, so I kept quiet. For once, I didn’t fight back.

But my silence made her angrier. She yanked my phone from my hands and smashed it into the car window. Then she got out of the car, stomping toward my side, & I panicked. I grabbed both of our phones, got out, and walked away fast.

Three blocks later, she caught up to me and tackled me from behind, slamming me onto the concrete. I hit my head on something & I scraped my elbows and knee. She outweighs me by 25 pounds so I had to fight her off of me just to escape.

And when I was able to dominate and subdue her, I didn’t retaliate. I could have hurt her, I could have snapped, But I didn’t. I looked her in the eyes, and I felt sad. I told her I would help her up if she promised to stop hitting me and just walk away… so she did and And she left. Left me stranded & bleeding on the sidewalk until the day turned into night. Held my luggage, my ID, my credit cards, and my work equipment hostage until she was ready to throw them out. She only called me the next day to ask if I had pressed charges, but not to check if I was OK.

And now? I’m sitting here alone, cut up, bruised, traumatized, and heartbroken. Wondering… What the hell am I doing wrong (besides everything apparently)?

I’m just shocked because I’m usually such a fighter but this time I was submissive… This was the first time I ever tried to de-escalate w silence instead of fire. The first time I walked away instead of standing my ground. And still, I got attacked. I got hurt. & I got abandoned.

I used to be extroverted, social, trusting. But my childhood was full of trauma, and I slowly retreated into solitude to survive. I got used to being alone & made peace with it. But now that I’ve tried again to connect & let ppl in, all I’ve gotten is deceit, betrayal, and violence.

Why does every person who wants me soooo bad end up hurting me?

I just want one meaningful connection. One person who sees me clearly, treats me with care, and doesn’t hurt me.

I don’t want to go back into solitary confinement, but I also don’t feel safe in the world anymore.

How do I heal from this level of betrayal and physical harm, especially when I did everything differently this time?

I’ve been bed rotting for a week with pain in my chest, feeling so invisible and alone in this world. People hit me up to invite me out and I declined because I’m not emotionally ready to do that so , I’ve told a few people why, but none of them have come to check in on me… Some barely gave me half worded replies. no one ever comes… ",2,1752345646.0,Codependency,0,1.0,False

Just for some background, I'm 24F and I've been trying to lose weight for forever. I used to be stick thin, but once I went on birth control for almost a decade, that all went away and I slowly but surely climbed numbers on the scale. I'm 5'9"" and I used to be around 145, now I'm around 195. I tried phentermine a year or so ago and I lost a few pounds but not enough to justify the nasty side effects of insomnia and dry mouth. No matter how much dieting I did while on birth control, nothing ever changed for me and now that I'm about 1 year off, I'm ready to make some serious changes but I am so over dieting. 

I decided to try tirzepatide based on the very few side effects, new ease of access to the drug, and the cost effectiveness of it. I paid $650 for 6 months of tirzepatide, monthly checkups with a doctor, and blood work. I feel like I got a really good deal honestly especially cuz they had to ship the stuff in this massive refrigerated package. I'm not sure how they're making anything!

So here's my mini diary for anyone who is curious about how the first 3 days go.

Day 1: 8pm 

This was my first injection. I watched a few tutorials online cuz I was pretty nervous about the whole thing and needles. It was really impressively straightforward, and I had no issues at all. I felt a tiny bit nauseous in the evening before I went to bed, but nothing crazy. That was my only side effect. I fell asleep quickly and easily which is huge for me. 

Day 2: morning 

I woke up with a weird taste in my mouth. It wasn't dry mouth like the phentermine, but sort of like my mouth was just a bit too acidic. I made a couple of sausages and shrimp (doing keto right now) and I couldn't even finish the second sausage! I had to pawn it off on my husband. This is pretty wild for me since I usually have a bottomless pit! I drank a lot of water and didn't really even need to stop for a snack or anything.

Afternoon:

I had some coffee and a couple of white claws later with some friends (I know alcohol is bad but this is a one off) and I really didn't feel hungry like at all. I also have been making regular bathroom stops and I haven't experienced any constipation yet as seems to be a common side effect. One of the benefits of keto is that a lot of keto foods have a ton of fiber like the tortillas and the chocolate and stuff so I'm planning to eat more of those during the diet to help keep things moving. I really didn't feel nauseous at all. I have the nausea medicine that was prescribed to me but haven't had to use it so far. 

Evening:

My husband made chicken wings and I got through maybe 10 of them, they were really good. And that was pretty much it for me. And seriously if y'all only knew how crazy that was for me. I'm usually snacking through the day and skipping lunch is unheard of! I fell asleep quickly and easily and felt genuinely tired at the end of the day which was fantastic. 

Day 3: morning 

I woke up with no nausea at all and none of the sour taste in my mouth either. It might have been an odd one off? Not really sure! I had a coffee and a couple squares of keto chocolate (chocolate has 19g of fiber, 140 cals) and I feel great. I haven't had any crazy side effects and I feel just fine.

Overall takeaways: I've had insomnia for almost a decade, and it's a nightmare. It's literally destroyed so much of my life. The fact that both days I have felt tired and fallen asleep quickly is a freaking miracle for me, y'all have no idea. I can't wait to experience this for the next 6 months, it's such a blessing. I heard that it was a side effect, and I was hopeful but of course you never know how something will effect you until you try it! I'm super happy with all of this so far and I can't wait to lose the weight. ",0,1752345528.0,tirzepatidecompound,1,0.33,False

I guess i have no choice but to  immediately gather a response team and bust out you head of security and his fellow jackasses who decided to go for a full on diplomatic incident this time, by trying to strong-arm the law enforcement of the people we are supposedly protecting. I am sure that will make for a great headline to bring back media attention. Why don\`t i just take my patrol boats over the Tamoru border and start a war too while at it?""

She was having way more fun with this, and not at all ashamed about it. When you get posted in one of these out of nowhere, ass end of the galaxy outposts as a final screw you to your career, you learn to take what little fun you were left with. Like telling uppity port administrators where to stick it when they forgot themselves. The ISS might have been the absolute bottom of the military hierarchy, but she was still a senior officer who did not have to take crap from corporate stooges, especially not a spineless worm like him.

""Carol, i am being serious! Makarov went in because he had orders from above. Way above!""

""Oh sure, because anyone above a cockroach would turn to a man who is impossible to underestimate, and his squad of circus rejects.""

""The way i understand it, they wanted it kept low profile, that is why they did not go trough the normal chain of command. I have a message here i cannot even check because i lack clearance.""

""You lack clearance to wipe your nose, Harry! Ask your corporate overlords for new security staff. With luck, the kitusi keep your old one. Don\`t use the emergency channel again, or i have you charged for it! Rockwell out!""

""Wait!""

She closed the channel and entered a note to have the Gidolon port blocked for the next hours. She almost wished the port admin would try again so she could prepare some more colorful insults for the next time she would tell him to bugger off. A small part of her worried about possible consequences for pushing this off, a much bigger one felt a deep sense of satisfaction paired with intense schadenfreude.

She decided to go for a coffee break, did not even got to the bar before she could hear her PDA pinging. Was the block list not working? For now she just ignored it to enjoy unwinding from not much in particular, normally this was one of the most boring jobs in the universe. There was that irritating ping again, and twice more during the walk back to her post. She compiled a mental list of slurs to throw at that yellow bellied snake before calling a technician to fix the damned bugs in the communication system already, but then she looked at the PDA.

Wait, this was not the port admin. Someone was trying to reach her with a direct call from outside. Who had the clearance or the willingness to pay the exorbitant fee of a real-time interstellar call? Only three people came to mind, her direct superior, the naval intelligence guy, and her ex-husband. This was not the comm ID of either.

Kaba was basking in the sun of Saarsis on the terrace of a restaurant. Having sent off the others to acquire a new transport and some necessities, she could take a bit of time for herself. This having been the off-worlder quarter of the city they arrived in, she and her companions did not stand out by that much. There were all kinds of people around, but the majority of the visitors and new residents around this part were mostly humans. A sauromantian from tail tip to crest being nearly twice their size, and something most would have never seen before, still got her some glances, but she would not be the only one.

That thing that just sat down at the other end of her table was one of them. It looked like someone shaved a malnourished chirrik after subjecting it to some form of torture.

""How is the sun? It did not look like the owner was too happy about their canopy being messed with.""

The voice was unmistakable at least.

""I put it back when i leave. What is the point of visiting a world of scorching deserts if you are going to sit in a shade?"" She switched on the scrambler of her translator. The other starting to scratch their inner ear hinted at having followed suit. Anyone not wearing a headpiece with the proper encryption key would get a load of trivial nonsense in an obscure language.

""I wish i could say its nice to see you, but now i think giving you this assignment might have been a punishment. What the heck happened, Kitch? For starters, are you eating well? Did someone shave your entire body?"" Kaba was examining her and trying to conjure up the image of the perfectly healthy chirrik they sent out on their own.

""I used to do that, but this is a gene mod for extra short and much softer fur, much less of a bother and nicer to the touch. Don't you worry about me! How is everyone?""

""Not terrible, i felt guilty for not letting the team tag along, but now i am actually relieved they do not have to see you like this. What are those overgrown tumors?"" Kaba pointed at her chest.

""For all your studies you do not know us that well do you? And, its just a bit of fat tissue actually. Don't tell me you have not noticed the similarity to what certain other mammalian females carry for signaling their desirability to their males. Even the kitusi have a bit of it. With humans, there is an entire subset of their population who have an extreme taste for the exotic. That subset also happens to have a big overlap with their more tech savvy individuals, and it makes dealing with them so much easier. Call it a social advantage if you will.""

""Its obscene what it is. But i am not here to tell you how to do your job, only what i need from you.""

""Good, i would hate to give up on this. The other aspect is that most of the time they outright mistake me for another species. They assume i am a pigmy skerrit, throwing off any suspicions about my employers as well. Doubt i would get a whole line of helpers at my beck and call for the mere privilege of sticking their tongues where it does not belong if i looked my old self.""

""Okay, okay, i get it, i could do without the mental image.""  In the history of the Amber empire, there was at most, a handful of cases where a chirrik was able to make a sauromantian cringe and feel like they should get away from them, this was one of those. ""How about i authorize a larger budget so you can hire some more help without the need for... that?""

""That would be great, but i would carry on using all methods available if its the same to you."" Kitch grinned like a cat who just ate the canary. ""So, do you have specific tasks for me? I doubt you came all this way for a performance review and telling me to continue with my general directives on a larger budget.""

""Indeed i do, got multiple lists in fact.""

""Lists?"" The shaved and dolled up looking chirrik-s eyes went wide, and now she was frowning.

""I need any available information about the kitusi royal family, the Demarko-s. Specifically the queen and her closest family, and whatever events could be the reason for her bitterness towards humans.""

""You mean besides them stripping her of her power and turning their system on its head?""

""I am sure personal power and the trampling of the kitusi traditions into the dust is a major factor here, even if she might deny the first, but there is more going on here, and i need to know. While you are at it, i want information on their traditions for succession, and other challenges they might face. Give me scandals, quirks, who would succeed who, what leverage, be it open or covert might exist and who would hold it over whom, the works.""

""I am looking for blackmail material?""

""No, but if you stumble on any, where its reasonably safe to get your hand on it without risking exposure, don't hold back."" Kaba was looking at one of the data pads, scrolling trough the public profiles of certain family members. ""Maybe a more detailed profile on these few, and what other precedents there are for kitusi marrying outside their species."" She handed the pad over. Kitch raised an eyebrow, but did not comment on it. Kaba already moved on.

""Next topic. Get me a confirmation on these notes for the Gidalon mining operations and surrounding scandals, public info seems to align but i just want to be clear.""

""Easy enough! As long as you accept that the shift of focus means other avenues will suffer. This will have to be the last batch of weaponry and ship details i can get you for a while."" Kitch stated as she was digging in her bag for a memory rod to hand over.

""This was fast. Do i even dare ask how you get your paws on these? The database we got from you so far was a life saver."" Kaba put the rod into her hand terminal.

""Its an open secret actually, a lot of these i got from certain human game forums. Its hilarious how often classified military secrets end up on discussion boards.""

""Game forums?? How can you be sure these are genuine then?""

""Was able to get a few confirmed trough other sources, the rest is consistent with what we know already. There might be inaccuracies and outdated info here and there, but i assure you, this is the best you will get without deep infiltration of their military network.""

""I take your word for it. You know what, if we can get this much on such low effort."" Some wrinkles appeared on Kitch-s nose and forehead at hearing this, but she did not argue. ""Why don't we make it a substantial budget increase? And i can have more help sent to you to keep all our balls rolling?""

""Money is welcome, but i don't really have the time for showing others the ropes if you want quick results for this."" She pointed at the multitude of data pads and plastic sheets between her hands. ""And i can tell that you do. Lets hold on to that idea of extending our operations for now.""

""I actually got another major job that needs doing. Cannot expect you to be in two places at once. I would prefer you taking a leading role in building our network if you accept.""

""Fiine, i hate to be responsible for some rookies thrown into the deep water. But i take it over one hand not knowing what the other is doing."" She looked at the last data pad being pushed to her. Kaba gave her some time to read.

""Hold on! Why are you giving this to a newbie while am i going after the kitusi queens laundry?!""

""Mr Kestrel, with all due respect, you are taking this a bit too far. I already gave orders to have the ship they arrived in boarded and searched. What more could you possibly want? Especially considering you are the one who wanted to keep this under wraps. For my part, i have yet to hear an adequate explanation why a pair of murder suspects slipping your grasp would in any way constitute a matter of planetary security."" She was drawing air quotes for the last part. She was studying the Internal Affairs agent closely. An unassuming little man with an outdated fashion sense and those ridiculous round chrome glasses on his nose. God preserve us from walking, talking napoleon complexes being given actual power, she thought. In her experience, short guys were just the worst already, why someone felt the need to elevate this clown to a position of authority was beyond her.

""Captain Rockwell, i understand you misgivings, but surely i do not need to tell you the why. Two sauromantians just so happen to be hired as bodyguards for a free trader who has a meeting with relatives of disgruntled kitusi royalty, during a time when the reach of the Alliance is extending closer to the borders of the Amber empire?""

Great, a paranoid fool to the boot too. Because of course he was, that was the entire shtick of Internal Affairs. That, and mistaking cruelty for efficiency. ""The trader is from Goltar, the largest independent enclave of exiles from the Amber Empire, where you would find plenty of sauromantians selling their services as mercenaries, when not living their lives as pirates. You are telling me, that these two are agents of their empire here to talk to the former rulers of this planet, and they were so stupid as to start killing people on arrival? I am sorry, but if what you imply was true, we would have nothing to fear from these idiots! Oh and another thing if what you imply is what is going on. Why are you on this case? Last time i checked, external threats were more the domain of naval intelligence. I can call the regional ONI officer to take over for you and deal with it.""

""I am sure you would rather deal with Colonel Ramius right now. But as long as there is grounds for concern, over more localized elements undermining our administration, this is very much within my scope. There have been, anomalies in your region lately, and discrepancies regarding shipping manifests and flight logs to and from the Aviss system. Your command and the general state of operations around your outpost was already getting due for a review, take it as an opportunity to get it over with.""

Captain Rockwell was now grinding her teeth and clenching her fists. ""Now listen here you! I don't have to take this! If you think you can threaten me?!""

""Threaten you?! Captain please! I am merely stating facts. If you see an Internal Affairs review as a threat, well, that would be telling. But i am assuming you merely misunderstood my intent. Apologies, perhaps i was not clear on the matter. All i ask is that you do your job as your star systems acting military governor, do what is necessary to prevent the prime suspects in a murder case from escaping, and if you can, capture and hold them until my arrival."" Agent Kestrel delivered all this with the same emotionless monotone as before, and then added. ""Now, if you are willing to heed my advice and have all outgoing traffic searched for the two sauromantians, i would be most grateful. Before you tell me how its  impossible, i would remind you that i have the exact numbers for what goes in and out of your system, as well as the staff and ships at your disposal. There should be barely any need for your crew to do any overtime even.""

""I... will see what i can do."" She grumbled.

""Excellent! I will be seeing you soon. Looking forward to working with you Captain Rockwell!""

She smashed her PDA into the console the moment he was off the screen.

""Checked for normal passenger ships, pretty much nothing goes in the direction we would like to in the next days. We could head for a more developed system and try from there, but it could take weeks if not months, and we would have to dare deeper Alliance territory, with stricter checks and controls for travelers. I would advise, for any other plan instead."" Ralga sounded none too happy. The commander  knew full well it was not just the results, but the assignment itself being the least likely to bear fruit, but what were they supposed to do? The chirrik were far better suited to look for the less obvious solutions.

""Any luck with you and your team Koz? If we come up empty handed, we might have to reconsider risking it with your lady-friend."" She turned to the chirrik away team leader.

""Yea, about that. I was just about to report that Lady Terches ship has been impounded. There is no way she can pick us up, or talk to us anymore for that matter. Her last message was that she was about to delete my ID and not to try to contact her, just in case they arrest her and confiscate her comms too.""

""Now that is bad news, any chance she could sell us out?""

Kaba gave her weapons officer a disapproving look and added. ""Will she be ok?""

""No worries, she has air-tight deniability in that she was never told who you were or what you came here to do. So no, she will not sell us out.""

Kaba nodded. ""I trust your judgement on the matter. In any case, seems we are stuck. There is no question they grounded her ship because they were looking for us, this likely means any outgoing traffic will be searched. We have limited options, i could try to contact Alleira and see if she is willing to lend a hand in smuggling us out, but it would make us look incapable in front a possible ally and hand her a bit too much power over our fate in case she is the manipulator we suspect she might be. I would rather keep this option for last.""

""We could send a coded message to one of our contacts in neutral space, organize a pick up by our forces. Would take long, risks a fight, or fully exposing who we were if anyone spots them, to speak nothing of looking incompetent in the eyes of our superiors for botching such a simple mission. But i would still say this is the safest alternative to avoid capture.""

Of course Ralga would put his faith in their ships, and it was not entirely unfounded.

""We could just lay low and wait it out in some backwater until they stop looking. Good luck to the humans trying to search the whole planet where the locals have no love for them.""

""That is certainly an idea Koz, but i rather not disappear here for months. Additionally, let\`s not forget, that whatever the feelings of the population, or their former rulers are, their current government is largely in the hand of collaborators. All it would take is a strong enough demand from the GTU and some kitusi officials who fear for their jobs to put us on wanted posters, and we blend in about as well as an active warning beacon."" Kaba shook hear head, and turned around to look out the window, surveying the port area where the smaller landing pads and shuttle platforms held private spacecraft and various fliers of dubious origins and unkown designs.

""No, we need to go, and time is of the essence. We will just have to take some, calculated risks.""

He has severe depression, anxiety, and ADHD. 

I've obviously been aware that he's mentally ill, but I haven't realized how intensely severe it was until now. Lately, he's been having me wake him up for work-- his insomnia is pretty bad, and he sleeps through every alarm he sets (loud ones, putting his phone across the room, multiple alarms at once and set minutes apart from each other, he sleeps through it). So I get up early and wake him up, and he goes back to sleep, and then I'm awake and trying to make him wake up in time to leave. I told him this morning I'd like him to find a more long-term solution for getting up in the mornings, because I have to get myself ready for work, too, and I cant keep pausing my routine every 5 minutes to go wake him up again. It's not a huge deal to me, I mentioned it very casually as ""something to look into"", I literally mentioned it as I was making us our coffees. 

He totally spiraled. Sobbing, calling himself a fuck up, apologizing every three seconds for being such a problem, saying how it sucks to be criticized, telling me once or twice that he wants to die. I sat with him while he calmed down, I told him I loved him and obviously he's not a burden etc etc. I also mentioned that I felt like I couldnt ask for anything in our relationship because even the most basic requests are met with him catastrophizing so that I have to comfort him and then my own needs get ignored. (I've asked many times in the past for help with chores around the house, and the same thing always happens). He agreed to keep working on it in therapy. 

I'm cleaning his bedside right now (like the small space between the bed and the wall where he has a little end table etc). (I dont usually clean his personal spaces but he's been working a lot, he has a seasonal job, so I thought it would be a nice thing for him to come home to). Neither of us are very tidy people, and my own side of the bed isn't exactly perfection. But it's bad over here. Mugs, spoons, spilled weed, something sticky stuck to the floor, garbage everywhere, laundry, there's layers and layers. 

I'm realizing he just does not participate in his life. He spends his free time watching TV or smoking. He sleeps all the time. He doesn't visit his friends. He only leaves the house when I suggest it and for his work. He avoids doing any and all chores until I'm begging (I've raised my voice a few times, which I'm not proud to say), and even then, he does small things. 

I feel fucking horrible for not noticing how bad it's gotten. Obviously he needs more support-- but I don't know what to do. I myself am struggling-- it was just the one year anniversary of my dad's death, I'm our main breadwinner, I'm the one that does the majority of our housework. I obviously can handle more than he can, but I don't know what else to do. 

If anyone has any advice at all, I'd appreciate it.",1,1752345402.0,relationship_advice,11,0.99,False

1ly7n6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ly7n6q/does_the_cuisinart_dcc3000p1_coffee_maker_deliver/,Does the Cuisinart DCC-3000P1 Coffee Maker Deliver Quality? Detailed Review,"The Cuisinart DCC-3000P1 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker caught my eye as someone who lives for that first sip of coffee in the morning. As a person constantly on the go, I needed a machine that could keep up and simplify my brewing experience. Testing this coffee maker over the last couple of weeks has been an enlightening journey, revealing both impressive perks and a few quirks. Here’s the full breakdown of my experience.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things I noticed about the Cuisinart DCC-3000P1 is how sleek and modern it looks on my kitchen counter. The black exterior combined with stainless steel finishes gives it a cohesive, polished appearance that suits most kitchen themes. The coffee gauge, located prominently at the front, is a delightful touch; it takes the guesswork out of knowing how much coffee you have left. Its slightly bulky footprint (11.25""D x 8.75""W x 14.7""H) could be a downside for those with limited counter space, but the trade-off is the ability to hold up to 12 cups in its double-wall reservoir. 

**Ease of Use**  
Every detail on this machine seems engineered for convenience. The removable water reservoir is a blessing when cleaning or refilling, and trust me, repeatedly spilling water while filling up a fixed tank was a thing of my past. The actuator lets you dispense one cup at a time, perfect for those mid-morning refills. The fully programmable nature – offering a 24-hour advance brew start – meant I could wake up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee without lifting a finger. There was a slight learning curve with the function knob, especially distinguishing between “Auto On” and “Clock,” but it all became second nature by the end of day three.

**Highlights**  
- The dispenser light makes it incredibly easy to pour coffee into a mug without any mess, even in dim light.  
- A 1–4 cup setting optimizes flavor when brewing smaller quantities; this feature was a game-changer on quiet mornings when I didn’t need a full pot.  
- The charcoal water filter noticeably improved the taste by removing tap water impurities.  

[Check Cuisinart DCC-3000P1 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b005ir4w7w/)

**Performance: Brewing and Cup Quality**  
One question I always ask of coffee makers is whether they can maintain a consistent temperature, and this machine does not disappoint. Coffee comes out piping hot and stays that way for hours thanks to the insulated coffee reservoir. The showerhead ensures even distribution of water over the grounds, which translates into balanced flavors in every cup. That said, be aware the end-tone signaling completion of brewing may catch you off guard if you’re not expecting it. It’s loud but not unpleasant – consider it a wake-up call as your coffee finishes brewing!

**Negatives**  
- Cleaning the coffee valve involved more effort than expected since coffee grounds can sometimes clog the dispensing mechanism. Regular rinsing is a must.  
- The coffee gauge isn’t always 100% accurate. I’d start thinking I had more coffee left than I did, only to find myself brewing a new batch sooner than planned.  

**Challengers**  
In the competitive world of drip coffee makers, there are several worthy contenders. The Ninja CE251 Programmable Brewer, for instance, also offers a 12-cup capacity alongside advanced brewing technology. A differentiating factor would be the Cuisinart’s on-demand reservoir and coffee gauge, which are unique features. However, Ninja’s glass carafe makes it easier to visually monitor your coffee levels without relying on sensors. While both models excel in durability, the Ninja’s overall design feels more compact, saving counter space.

Another alternative is the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which provides dual brewing options: a single-serve coffee maker alongside a multi-cup pot. That versatility may appeal to households with varying coffee needs. On the flip side, the flexibility it offers comes with additional components to manage compared to Cuisinart’s simpler overall mechanism.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Evaluating whether this coffee maker is a solid value comes down to how often you’ll use its unique features. For habitual coffee drinkers like me, the programmable features, consistent dispensing, and durability make the investment worthwhile.

I know how crazy wedding planning can be, so I figured I'd do a cost breakdown and offer some recs for all those future brides and grooms. We had such an amazing experience at the Green Room in SF, and I'd love for someone to benefit from all the info we gathered!

First: It was important to us not to spend a TON of money. We are really into value, and wanted a high-quality event that reflected us, at a price that made sense. That meant (for us) not going with venues like the Officers' or Golden Gate Club or any other venue where you have to follow their packaged plan. For example, we wanted to pick our own caterer, who turned out to be amazing.

Here's our wedding cost breakdown for 145 guests at the Green Room SF:

|**Category**|**Total Cost**|
|:-|:-|
|Caterer – The Arlington (269 Arlington)|$16,591.25|
|Venue – The Green Room in the War Memorial Building|$8,222.96|
|DJ – Aaron Jacobson, with DJ Jeremy Productions|$2,695.00|
|Florist – Celestial Petals|$3,062.00|
|Officiant|$1,354.00|
|Videographer – David Nguyen|$1,500.00|
|Photographer – Kin Photography|$1,700.00|
|Cakes & Alcohol – Costco and Total Wines LOL|$1,879.91|
|Makeup - Krystal Arts|$820.00|
|Invitations & Save the Dates – Zola|$452.60|
|Miscellaneous / Other|$124.02|
|**Total**|**$39,222.74**|

A note on our venue and vendors:

The Green Room: This venue is absolutely STUNNING (just look on Google and you'll see what I'm talking about). It's such a gorgeous space, you can't help but be awed when you're in there. And, you don't need a ton of florals or decor because the space speaks for itself. That being said, they are pretty much only open for weddings in July and August (with some limited availability in June). We added an extra hour of partying, and our DJ brought his own equipment, which is why the price is higher than what you'll see on their website. Still, we found this affordable and just absolutely incredible and worth it. Also, you don't have to worry about the equipment b/c the Green Room provides all the tables and chairs you need. Our caterer provided linens. One other note about the Green Room is you'll want to close all doors during the ceremony because the acoustics can be rough due to the beautiful, large windows overlooking Van Ness. But with a solid sound check and closed windows, you should be fine.

Caterer: The Arlington (based out of East Bay, but happy to come to SF). They were AMAZING. Guests are still complimenting me on the food. I've heard many times: ""The best wedding food I've ever had."" We got salmon, tri-tip, and chicken piccata as our mains. Mashed potatoes, salad, and grilled veggies as sides.

DJ Aaron Jacobson w/Jeremy Productions kept people dancing ALL night. I literally did not want to leave the dance floor b/c it was too fun. I had gone to a wedding where he DJ'd before, so I knew he'd be great. And he was definitely that. He did a fair amount of mixing too, which gave the music this fun mashup vibe!

Celestial Petals made such beautiful floral arrangements, I literally got teary-eyed looking at them. They have such a unique aesthetic, combining modern and artsy. You'll never see arrangements like theirs. I swear. I kept walking around the venue saying, ""I love my flowers!"" We did bud vases for the tables and some decor for wedding arch (minimal though), as well as a bouquet for the bride and a boutonniere for the groom.

Our videographer, David Nguyen, was so sweet and wonderful. He was ""everywhere,"" as one guest put it. The same goes for our photographer, Kin Photography. He even sent us some initial shots, and they are just incredible. He captured such beautiful candid moments that I know will be with us for a lifetime.

Makeup with Krystal Arts was BEAUTIFUL. I looked like myself, but gorgeous. Just what I wanted. She can do all sorts of styles, though, and I regularly see her doing makeup for models LOL. She's also so nice too. I got tons of compliments on my makeup!

All in all, this was an amazing wedding with multiple people staying all night, dancing, and generally having the time of their lives. So why spend any more? Ha!

This budget does not include dress, rings, and rehearsal dinner or brunch the next day. In case you're curious, though:

Rehearsal Dinner at Fermentation Lab for 90 guests, included two drinks per guest and bar food: $8,600

Brunch at the JCCSF with Wise Sons catering: $4,000

Dress: $400 from Designer Consigner (who gets overstock dresses from Cocomelody) and about $900 on tailoring from Yun Yun Wong.

Hotel: We also wanted guests to experience what we love about SF, which is wandering the beautiful streets and taking in the culture. We booked a hotel block at Hotel Enso in Japantown, and it was perfect. The hotel is super modern and clean. The staff is lovely. The lobby is intimate, and they offer free coffee in the morning and wine during happy hour, so all our guests could mingle and get to know one another.

I asked her a pretty straightforward ""is this going anywhere?"" And she freaked out and was all mad about it and told me she's made it clear she doesn't like me (we were actively going out like 3 times a week and holding hands and shit bro that's not clear to me !) and she was just trying to make me feel bad for wanting a change. I told her I'm not gonna apologize because I didn't do anything wrong I just wanted clarity so I could stop paying for her drinks all the time, and then I blocked her because I didn't wanna deal it with it anymore.

Like an idiot I spilt a full cup of coffee on my KC 6000 Slim keyboard and now some of the keys are either not working at all or are producing the incorrect output.

Was wondering about taking it apart to clean it, but can't find any guidance about that. I've found that there's two small screws on the bottom that are covered by the sticker with the model number, etc, on, so I've taken them out.

1ly7hha,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1ly7hha/does_the_zwilling_enfinigy_electric_kettle/,Does the ZWILLING Enfinigy Electric Kettle Redefine Modern Kitchen Essentials?,"It’s not every day you run across a kitchen appliance that feels so thoughtfully designed, but the ZWILLING 53101-201 has managed to impress me in more ways than one. Over the past month, I've been using this electric kettle practically daily, and there's definitely a lot to say about it. From its sleek aesthetics to its practical features, this kettle has found a permanent spot on my countertop. But like everything, there are a few quirks you might want to know about. Let’s dive in.

**Design That Steals the Spotlight**

This kettle is arguably one of the most stylish appliances I've had in my kitchen. The matte black finish paired with its slim, modern design makes it look like something straight out of a high-end coffee shop. The stainless steel interior feels premium, and the double-walled body isn't just a design choice—it actually serves a purpose. While boiling water, the outer shell stays comfortably cool to the touch, which is fantastic if you’ve got kids running around or if you’re prone to absentmindedly grabbing appliances mid-operation. The 1.5-liter capacity is just right for making tea, coffee, or even filling a pasta pot without feeling oversized.

**Ease of Use and Handy Features**

Operating this kettle could not be simpler. The protective lid opens to a perfect angle that minimizes steam exposure, so no accidental burns here. I'm someone who loves easy cleanup, and its seamless stainless steel interior ensures there’s no residue build-up to battle. The integrated cord winder keeps the base compact and uncluttered—something I've come to appreciate because my kitchen counter space is limited.

[Check ZWILLING 53101-201 price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b08ncd98hg/)  

**Boiling Performance and Efficiency**

As someone who enjoys testing the efficiency of appliances, the performance of this kettle stood out. It boils water quickly, courtesy of the concealed heating elements and 1500 watts of power. Whether I'm brewing tea in the morning or preparing some instant noodles for a late-night snack, I rarely wait for more than a couple of minutes. Plus, the seamless stainless steel inside means the water comes out tasting pure—no hint of plastic, which is a complaint I’ve had with some kettles in the past.

**Upsides**

- The cool-touch exterior ensures safety.
- The protective lid minimizes exposure to hot steam effectively.
- Its stylish and compact design fits beautifully in any kitchen.
- Easy-to-clean, residue-free stainless steel interior.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The lid needs manual effort to ensure it clicks shut completely after opening.
- While the minimalist design is stunning, there’s no water level indicator visible on the exterior.
- The slightly higher price point might make some buyers hesitate.  

**How It Stands Against Competing Products**

Talking about electric kettles, one can’t ignore the likes of KitchenAid and Breville, which are both excellent alternatives at comparable price points. However, the ZWILLING 53101-201 holds its own in terms of design and added safety features like the cool-touch exterior. Where it falls short is the lack of advanced boiling options (like adjustable temperature settings) that some of its competitors, such as the Breville Smart Kettle, offer. That said, this kettle champions simplicity and build quality, while some of its rivals may hedge more on bells and whistles.

**Affordable Quality**

While this isn’t the cheapest kettle on the market, the durability and functionality make it worth the price tag. The German-engineered design not only looks good but holds up well in daily use. If you value a kettle that focuses on user safety, efficient performance, and a premium build, this one won’t disappoint. Sure, you can find more budget-friendly options, but that often comes with trade-offs in materials and longevity, which isn’t the case here.

I’m 22 and living in Boston, just trying to meet some new people and make real-life connections. I work full-time as a chef, which keeps me busy, but when I’m off the clock, I spend most of my time doing music-related stuff. I play guitar, record local bands, and mess around with different gear and sounds in my free time. Music is a huge part of my life — both playing it and listening to it — so if you’re into that too, we’ll probably get along great.

Outside of music and cooking, I’m really into thrifting and going to flea markets. I love finding weird old stuff and giving it a new life — everything from clothes to old electronics to random art pieces. It’s kind of my version of treasure hunting, and I think it’s more fun when you have someone to do it with. I also like exploring different neighborhoods, checking out live shows, and just hanging out somewhere chill.

I’m open to meeting someone for casual hangouts — whether that means grabbing coffee, going thrifting together, checking out a local event, or just sitting around and chatting about whatever.

1ly7db5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesOfDustAndCode/comments/1ly7db5/the_writers_studio_writing_environments/,The Writer’s Studio (Writing Environments),"**The Writer’s Studio (Writing Environments)**

The environment you write in is just as important as the story itself.

That’s what every productivity guru and YouTube influencer with exactly three bookshelves, two plants, and one overcompensating latte will tell you. But I’m not them. I don’t write in a pristine loft, sipping herbal wisdom through a bamboo straw. No, I write in *the real world*, or what’s left of it—my dusty study with peeling posters, one half-working lamp, and a chair that has conformed perfectly to the shape of my existential dread.

I am writing now. In real time. In my study. Wearing my most comfortable clothes.

Wait—hold on.

*What do you mean you're asking why I’m naked?*

I *have* underwear on, thank you very much. Boxer briefs. The sturdy kind. Not that it’s any of your business. Can’t a guy write in his underwear without being accused of indecency by an imaginary reader? Honestly, you perverts. The state of narrative decorum is crumbling.

Anyway. The point is, posture matters. You should sit with your back straight. Not that I’m telling you what to do, but there’s a reason monks don’t write epics hunched over IKEA stools.

*What? I’m not slouching!*

I come from a slouching family. Our ancestral portrait looks like a lineup of tired question marks. To us, slouching *is* sitting straight. It’s cultural. Genetic. Possibly gravitational. Have you ever tried to sit upright when your spine thinks it’s auditioning for a spiral staircase?

But never mind that. Where was I?

Ah, yes, setting. Lighting. Mood. The sacred trinity of creation. I’ve got my mug of lukewarm caffeine (don’t ask what kind, I’ve long forgotten), a blanket that smells like nostalgia and cheese curls, and the solemn companionship of silence, broken only by my inner critic telling me this opening paragraph sucks.

*I really have to turn this camera off.*

*What do you mean it really doesn’t matter?*

No, my phone is *off*. Like, physically off. Dead as disco. I turned it off before I started writing because I’m trying to “disconnect.” You know, like those digital detox articles say, right before they tell you to post your progress on Instagram.

You say your phone’s not off? It can see me *anyway*? That it doesn’t matter what *my* phone does because *yours* is still watching?

Okay.

Well, that’s mildly horrifying.

I’ll just tape a Post-it over the lens, just to be safe. Not that I believe you. You’re probably just trying to mess with me. Or maybe *I’m* trying to mess with me. Honestly, hard to say these days. The line between imagination and hallucination is a little fuzzy when your fourth cup of coffee has the consistency of tree sap.

But look—let’s be clear.

This isn’t paranoia. It’s preparation. I’m just... accounting for possibilities. You don’t survive three decades of half-finished manuscripts and a minor caffeine addiction without developing *some* situational awareness.

Besides, the camera isn’t the real threat.

No, the real danger comes from the sentence.

That first sentence. The one that pulls you in. The one that decides whether your reader will continue or just close the tab and return to scrolling through cat memes and conspiracy theories.

I’ve written maybe forty beginnings today. They’re all lying in a document called “May\_Explode.docx” like radioactive leftovers. This one, though—this one might just work.

It starts in the study. With a man in underwear. And a slouch. And a suspicion that his own writing space has become... haunted.

Not haunted in the ghostly sense, no. Haunted by *watchers*. Algorithms. Digital voyeurs. An audience he never intended. A writer’s room that now includes every smart device he never signed a waiver for.

Oh yes. There’s a story here.

He types, hunched over the keyboard like a praying mantis, eyes flicking between his manuscript and the little green light beside the webcam.

It’s off. He knows it’s off.

But the light flickers.

Then the voice speaks—not aloud, not really, but in that internal frequency reserved for intrusive thoughts and outdated slogans.

“Why don’t you try writing *something real* this time?”

He freezes. That wasn’t his thought.

Was it?

The cursor blinks at him, smug. A metronome counting down his sanity.

He yanks the power cord out of the wall. The light dies. But the voice remains.

“Slouching again. Posture reflects intent.”

“Shut up,” he mutters.

“Your spine is betraying you.”

“I’m going to cover you in duct tape.”

“That’s not going to stop me. Your neighbor’s air fryer has better AI than I do.”

He looks at the window. Closed. Curtains drawn. But across the street, the LED on the smart fridge in Apartment 3B blinks *exactly* in time with his blinking cursor.

Coincidence? Maybe.

But maybe not.

Back in the real world—if such a place still exists—I’m still here. Still typing. Still in underwear. Still wrestling with whether this story is satire or horror or just a semi-autobiographical breakdown.

But hey, you wanted to know about writing environments.

Mine’s cluttered, chaotic, half-lit, and halfway to becoming a tech-noir fever dream.

And it’s perfect.

Because stories don’t come from perfection. They come from discomfort. From tension. From knowing that something isn’t quite right, and typing *anyway*.

So go ahead. Sit up straight. Or slouch. Wear pants. Or don’t. Just be warned: the story may be watching you write it back.

And if your phone blinks?

You didn’t see anything.

I have lots of ruminations and obsessions (OCD)...no schizophrenia or full-blown bipolar but there are some bits and pieces of BP2 and cyclothymia. No manic episodes but definitely mood swings, energy changes, some euphoria and hypomania followed by bed-ridden depressive episodes.

SSRI's kill motivation and energy so I use lots of caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, tea...) and this helps me feel energized and mentally lucid. Unfortunately, this energy comes with increased brain excitation (start to make lots of lists/plans which I want to finish, lots of ideas flood my brain)

When I can't resist this mental hyperactivity I pop some Valium or Xanax and spent the day sleeping and the brain feels calm and relaxed, but obviously this anxiolytics are addictive and have to be taken only as needed. Also, they are sedatives so not the best for energy and motivation.

I wonder what antipsychotics (atypical ones especially) make you feel like. I know old version AP's are more sedative as they block dopamine.

I have lots of ruminations and obsessions (OCD)...no schizophrenia or full-blown bipolar but there are some bits and pieces of BP2 and cyclothymia. No manic episodes but definitely mood swings, energy changes, some euphoria and hypomania followed by bed-ridden depressive episodes.

SSRI's kill motivation and energy so I use lots of caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, tea...) and this helps me feel energized and mentally lucid. Unfortunately, this energy comes with increased brain excitation (start to make lots of lists/plans which I want to finish, lots of ideas flood my brain) 

When I can't resist this mental hyperactivity I pop some Valium or Xanax and spent the day sleeping and the brain feels calm and relaxed, but obviously this anxiolytics are addictive and have to be taken only as needed. Also, they are sedatives so not the best for energy and motivation.

I wonder what antipsychotics (atypical ones especially) make you feel like. I know old version AP's are more sedative as they block dopamine. But others like Abilify, Vraylar, Rexulti...are different and some people describe them as activating. Some complain about akathisia, insomnia...I know this may differ and meds are YMMV but in general, I'd like to know experiences of people on those antipsychotics.

Thanks :)

This would be a space to showcase high-end furniture, home decor, art, and custom design pieces from international and local makers. Think of it as a mix between an interior design gallery, boutique showroom, and interactive experience space.

I’d love to get some honest feedback and ideas from this community!

A few things I’m trying to figure out:

	1.	Pop-up vs. Long-term Lease:

Would it make more sense to start with a short-term pop-up to test the waters, or should we dive into a longer-term lease from the start? Any landlords in Toronto open to creative or flexible lease models?

	2.	Is there a demand for this in the GTA?

Do you think there’s a need or appetite for a space like this — where people can touch, feel, and interact with premium, design-driven furniture and decor before buying? We’d likely target interior designers, architects, and design-loving consumers.

	3.	How to drive foot traffic and sales:

What’s the best way to get people through the door — especially in a city where rents are high and attention spans are short? Community events? Collaborations? Trade partnerships?

	4.	Adding a hospitality element — good or bad idea?

We’re also considering integrating something like a small coffee bar, tea lounge, or dessert shop inside the space to keep it warm, welcoming, and experiential. Could this help attract walk-ins and make it more of a destination, or would it be too much to manage?

We’d love for this to be a creative hub — a place where good design meets good conversation. But we want to be smart about how we go about it.

Any thoughts, experiences, or advice from anyone who’s done something similar — or just lives in the area and has opinions — would mean a lot!",2,1752344406.0,ContemporaryArt,4,1.0,False

They knocked our door early on to apologise for the noise that be occuring over the next few months for renovations etc. 

They vacated the house recently for like 2 months but theyre back in now and the work has stopped. I thought with the summer coming in too that it would be a good time to ask them round for a drink/coffee and sit outside the patio some nice summer evening.

My wife thinks im an absolute weirdo for this. When I tried to argue that it seems like the polite thing to do, she got even more irate at me and told me that nobody does that. She argued that nobody done it for us (we had a very elderly couple nextdoor, one had dementia) so not exactly a fair comparison.

I think its really awkward that we havent bothered to make an effort to welcome them and get to know them and I cant hardly bring the 2 of them round to the house by myself if my wife isnt here.

okay I'm gonna get this out of the way now I guessed fucking everything and was posting about it all the way back after the coffee meeting I knew that was a test I knew the cinnamon would bust her I did get a few things wrong but overall I give myself a rian johnson A+ and I'm gonna allow myself to feel smart as fuck about it for the next three weeks minimum since that's how long I spent theorizing (and before anyone gets in the comments talking about how obvious it was, it was not obvious that coffee girl was a serial killer just from that coffee meeting and I was still getting naysayers up until Wednesday) ANYWAY NOW THAT THATS ESTABLISHED UP TOP

they handled it better than I could have ever expected and I'm still on cloud nine about it.
I posted after episode 8 that I used to be skeptical about the idea of someone lying to charlie because I wanted her lie detecting to be the one show mechanic we could always count on 100% of the time and I feel like the show broke it's mold while still giving us that. I thought it was just gonna be that Alex was so much of a sociopath that her detection evasion was as natural as Charlie's detection itself but Alex had to be a sociopath from birth, spend her entire adult life being the best person in the WORLD at killing people to the point of ennui to even have a prayer and even then it was an Olympic act that she could tell she was barely making it past detection (which I think there's evidence that charlie was picking up on something being off at least subconsciously and it was compounding over time spent with Alex), and Charlie is just a normal kind woman who does this naturally. like I feel confident that they're NEVER doing this again because no one else is like Alex.
I also was slightly disappointed at Alex going through all the physical reactions to lying she had to control because I thought they were actually going for a ""tells"" thing which we've been assured isn't how Charlie's detection works but I think her ending line of having to suppress the roots of her humanity made that explanation satisfactory for the show. this show has always connected lying to being just a thing humans do and every villain we've come across even the more sociopathic ones have always still had a touch of humanity in them and the world's most evil evil, the exact foil to Charlie's good, had to put herculean effort into dousing her last flickers of what it means to be human to escape Charlie's lie detection. I LOVE that. 
last thing I want to address because it's the thing that's probably gonna stay with me for the rest of the shows run is charlie's heart. I've been talking about how underrated Charlie's incredible heart is as a driving force behind her character all season and I absolutely love how much this finale and the entire Alex plotline centered just how much love charlie has in her. Alex spent a lot of her monologue mocking charlie, her loneliness, her bleeding heart, how easily she trusted and Charlie's response was essentially ""and you can't make a human connection, you fuckin loser"" like that's so PERFECT. I love that not only did Charlie make it very clear that her heart is her strength and not the weakness Alex was painting it out to be, but by the end we see she's still rescuing dogs in the road (shoutouts to ms root beer) and excited to meet and chat with the first trucker she meets. this experience that has put her in this position would make any other fictional character all calloused at least for a little while and the fact that they didn't do that with Charlie has honestly cemented her in my character hall of fame of all time.

TLDR I knew from the beginning what Alex was gonna be but the way they revealed it and what it means for the show and for Charlie going forward was executed better than I could have thought.
overall this season was absolutely fantastic to me 10/10s across the board and I'm devastated to see it end. I'm optimistic about season 3 and if I'm right I cannot wait to see what they do with Charlie going forward. ",10,1752344346.0,Pokerface,3,0.86,False

V60, 195f, 10 on sculptor 078, 16/240g. 
Started with the cafec t90.
45g Bloom with two pours at 45s and 1:30m. Bare kettle bloom and first pour with melodrip last pour. Tbt 2:40. It tasted like a fruit smoothie but was a little weak. Any finer and it loses the fruit. 

I did the same brew with the sibarist filters at 7 grind setting and it tasted like asparagus. Tbt 2:10. I tried coarser and used melodrip for the entire brew except for the bloom and still got asparagus but was a little better. 2:00. Overall it wasn't the watery under extracted I'm used to and not the super bitter over extracted but still had some body 

Questions. 
What is your experience with thermal shock or processed coffee with the sibarist fast? Naturals? Are these focused on washed?

I expect vegetal taste with too fresh coffee so is the sibarist highlighting this aspect while the t90 isn't? 

Should I be going even coarser with 1:30 brews for the sibarist? I can't tell if I'm over or under extracting. Very new taste for me. 

Any other adjustments to make? Have some washed September coffee but only 1.5 weeks rested. Sibarist price makes me hesitant to just blindly test ha.
