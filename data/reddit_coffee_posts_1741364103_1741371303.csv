First owner (purchased 11.8.24). Magnacut blade. The fit and finish on this knife is clean as expected, though it did arrive with the usual lock-stick (I have worked it out and can now open and close with one hand no problem). The blade is centered with solid lock up. Knife has never been carried, cut, disassembled, or sharpened. No blemishes that I can find. Comes in the Strider ""Tactical Baggie"" (tm). IFKYK.

First Owner. S45VN Blade. Very light carry and cut around the house. No disassembly or sharpening. Scales have an aggressive tumble so I can‚Äôt rule out a snail or two, but would find it unlikely given that the toughest thing it cut was a bag of coffee. Dead center, solid lock up. Comes in Medford hard case and box with COA, stickers, patch and warranty card.

1j5vhzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1j5vhzg/premature_worrying_ruining_potential_relationships/,Premature worrying ruining potential relationships,"I often notice that I start to worry a lot whenever I meet a new girl where there seems to be a mutual romantic interest. I met a girl just this weekend. We connected well and it seemed that it could turn into something more. But then, the worry started setting in. All of a sudden, my mind created all kinds of irrational thought patterns that I normally don't do. I started worrying about missing out and overanalyzing even the smallest of behaviors. Even as I'm writing this, I can feel the physical sensation of unease in the stomach (very common way for my body to experience worry).

So where does this worry come from? I did some reflection and found that my worry probably stems from past potential relationships that I missed out on due to a lack of commitment on my part. So whenever I meet someone that seems like it could turn into something, I start to worry and my mind goes:

>""how can i be flirty without being creepy?"" ""should I get a haircut or does it seem too ambiguous?"" ""what if she loses interest?"" ""should I invite her out for a coffee or is it cringe?"" ""I need to make a move or she's gonna go for someone else"" ""is sending a voice note creepy?""

As you can probably see, there's a lot of overthinking going on. And the frustrating part is that whenever I don't worry, I usually manage to commit pretty well. Like this weekend, I connected well with the girl, wanted to get to know her more so I asked for her snapchat. Simple. No worries. Or today, I got a haircut and just now sent her a message asking if she was up to take a coffee sometime. I wish I could have this ""fuck it"" approach more. But it's these short experiences of worry that sometimes makes me think irrationally and I fear it's gonna make me ruin a potential relationship. I wish to be free from it.

The worst part is that worry is a losing game. If everything goes my way (which is an unrealistic expectation), I have not gotten rid of the worry. If it doesn't go my way, it only amplifies the worry. Not sure how to deal with it.

Anyone that's went through similar experiences? What can I do about this?",2,1741370895.0,Healthygamergg,2,1.0,False

I asked her if it was okay for her to go for a coffee/ice cream together, and she told me that she was a bit afraid to go out alone with a person she met on the internet, even if she thought I was a good person. A couple of weeks go by and I see that her dance group holds classes open to everyone so I ask her if it's okay if I sign up for a trial lesson she says that it's fine if I'm interested in the lessons but if I go just to see her this scares her a bit I reassure her that it's just for the lesson, I'm going to do this trial lesson I like it and I'm having fun so I decide to sign up (during the lesson she came to ask me how I was getting on). From that day on, WhatsApp became much more distant, we continued to see each other and chat a bit during class but that's it. Last week her group performed in a club, I went too and we had a lot of fun together the next day during class I asked her ""Since you've finished with your exams and you're freer would you like to go out together"" and she replied that she doesn't have time. As soon as I got home I found two messages from her (she never texts first) in which she told me that she only now realized how little free time she has between university and the dance group and that she doesn't even talk regularly with her family/best friends I replied to her about an hour later that everything was ok and I understood her priorities she saw it and didn't reply the next day I sent her a message asking if everything was ok and she didn't even see it. In the past, she told me she had little time but anyway, we stayed almost every day to chat even 2/3 hours, and in person, she is always calm in talking to me so I don't understand this change, tomorrow we will see each other in class and I was thinking of asking her for explanations on these changes and if everything is ok.

Sonder is a word from the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows, and this is their definition:

*‚ÄúSonder*

*n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own‚Äîpopulated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness‚Äîan epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you‚Äôll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.‚Äù*

We are each of us alone in the cavern of our own skull. We can try to explain ourselves to each other in words, but in the end I‚Äôll never know how it feels to be you, and you‚Äôll never know how it feels to be me, no matter how much empathy we might have for each other. It‚Äôs a lonely feeling.

The other thing I‚Äôve been thinking about a lot lately is the tendency of people to treat others as NPCs in their own personal video game. It‚Äôs obviously not a new thing for humans to do, but with the rise of AI writing and AI art, I see more and more people online accusing each other of not being real in a whole new scary way. I‚Äôve seen the most arbitrary criteria levied against posts to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that they were made by AI. Of course AI generated stuff does exist, but I don‚Äôt think people are as good at spotting it as they think they are. I feel like the default position should be kindness, rather than flailing around to prove that everyone else is a robot except for you. So that‚Äôs why I decided to start this project.

Whenever I‚Äôm stuck in an art rut, I like to draw weird little faces. I have over 100 now, and I‚Äôve just been keeping them in an origami box and not doing anything with them. But I think maybe this could be a good way to begin to start to represent a tiny piece of the enormity of the idea that is sonder. I asked my friends to choose a face and think of one thing they would want to tell the world about themselves, and I started to make these tiny books that you see in the photographs, each one unique and representing the entirety of a life, the same way the AIDS quilt does. Since I already have so many drawings, I thought I‚Äôd start collecting words from people on the internet. So if you would like to participate, please either comment here, DM me, or comment on the Youtube video linked at the top of the post with the following:

* Your first name (it doesn‚Äôt have to be your real name, but you should pick a name that you feel represents you)
* What you would like me to write inside the card. The way I think of it is, if I had one chance to tell the world something about my existence, what would I say?
* If you like, you can choose a specific face ,or I can just pick one for you.

I also plan on making more short videos showing the making of the cards, so if you would like to tell me a longer story about yourself that I can read out loud in under three minutes, I would be happy to include it in a video.",1,1741370316.0,thebookofsonder,0,1.0,False

1j5v6li,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1j5v6li/started_getting_aura_migraines_again_after_not/,Started getting aura migraines again after not having them for over 10 years,"Recently started getting aura migraines again. I used to get them about once a month or once every other month between 12-18. I got one at 19 and then they magically went away. Fast forward to almost 31 and I‚Äôve gotten 3 within the past 2 weeks which has never happened to me before. Trying to figure out what the culprit is.

My first migraine happened right when I was about to start my period. It was at night but I can‚Äôt really think of what could have triggered it. 2nd migraine happened about a day or so after my period ended. That day had been extremely stressful so I chalked it up to that. I also didn‚Äôt eat that morning and had around 3 cups of coffee (whoops lol). Then my 3rd one yesterday happened and I tracked everything throughout the day:

3/6 - before migraine set
- 2 black coffees at work
- Cereal for breakfast (small)
- Mint Tea 
- Lunch - pork + salad/dressing 
- Ovulating 
- I bottled water
- Took biotin
- Not stressed today but staring a lot at screen for work
- Also on my phone
- Wore blue light glasses
- Have been smoking a hybrid joint pass few days on top of strong weed/THC past 3 weeks after trying to quit 

After - took excedrin, vitamin c, magnesium 
Cleared with minimal pain. Still felt sensitive after. 

I am a chronic weed smoker and tried to quit cold turkey a month ago but only lasted 2 weeks. Started smoking again and then started getting aura migraines again. I also struggle with eating in the morning and I constantly skip meals. I‚Äôve lost about 5 pounds the past few months due to stress/moving and work. 

Made an appointment with an optometrist and my primary care doctor to get everything checked out. But any suggestions on what could be the culprit? Also I picked up some iron, niacin and b12 on top of magnesium on vitamin c to see if that helps. If anyone has some remedies that helped stop aura migraines from coming on that would be helpful!

Having spent nearly 2 years meeting people on the apps and in the wild, I have made zero progress when it comes to relationships. 
So far I have had crushes, situationships, a FWB and several ONSs. None have led to anything serious, even though I have heard that casual relationships can gradually transform into romances or that you can develop feelings for someone you initially find too boring.
I‚Äôve tried it all ‚Äî giving nice guys a chance, dating out of my type, plucking the courage to approach the rare guys that I like in coffee shops and night clubs. The thing is, whenever there is a connection and it looks like my fancy is reciprocated, the guy ends up telling me he is not looking for anything serious ‚Äî and by serious I mean not necessarily a relationship or marriage, but at least dating for 2+ months. 
My 6-months-long situationship told me that he didn‚Äôt want to date at all due to past trauma. My FWB of 3 months said he started to prefer meeting new people instead. For some reason I only seem to get along this guys who are either too much in their heads with their own complexes and traumas or f*ckboys who toy with me until they get bored.
I can‚Äôt help but start feeling like I am not good enough to be someone‚Äôs girlfriend. Like, my situationship could have seen that I was different from the girl who had hurt him and could have given me a chance if I had been better looking, nicer to him, more popular etc. Or, my FWB has had girlfriends before and could have fallen for me  if I had been a better lover, easier on the go, had lower standards of treatment etc. (I was never in love with him, but could see myself potentially dating him as I felt 100% myself around him)
My therapist told me that there is nothing wrong with me and that I am just yet to meet my person, but every failed attempt just makes me question my worth even more. I have heard about the Taxi Cab theory, but I don‚Äôt really believe it. I mean, if some person thought I was good enough for him and could see a future with me, he would have feared losing me and would have chosen me instead of going for dozens potential ONSs or succumbing to his complexes? 
The most evident problem I see with myself is that I have standards and I usually confront my dates if I feel like I am being mistreated (date canceled just an hour prior, lies etc). Could I be too difficult? Am I really not good enough? Or should I just try more and wait? In all honesty, I am just losing hope. ",3,1741369796.0,dating,4,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs talk about Microsoft‚Äôs new **Phi-4-multimodal model** and why it‚Äôs basically the Swiss Army knife of AI right now.

### üî• The Big Highlights
- **Phi-4-multimodal**: Imagine an AI that can *see*, *hear*, AND *talk* like a human. Launched this March, it‚Äôs already solving real-world problems ‚Äì like helping you fix your broken coffee maker by analyzing a photo *and* your panicked voice note. Retailers are sweating (in a good way). [Deep dive here](https://www.schneider.im/microsoft-azure-ai-gpt-4-5-phi-4-stability-ai-o3-mini-gpt-4o-audio-and-realtime/).
- **GPT-4.5 flexes harder**: OpenAI‚Äôs newest model cut its *‚Äúhallucination‚Äù rate by 37.1%* (fewer made-up facts!) and boosted accuracy to **62.5%**. Your ChatGPT Pro subscription just got way more worth it. [Details](https://www.superpowerdaily.com/p/openai-launches-gpt-4-5-its-largest-model-to-date).
- **AI vs. Glaucoma**: New medical AI spots eye disease with **93.52% accuracy**. Meanwhile, generative AI could add **$4.4 TRILLION** to the global economy yearly. üí∏ *Mic drop.*

### üß† Why This Matters
- **Retail revolution**: Phi-4 isn‚Äôt just smart ‚Äì it‚Äôs **context-aware**. Show it a blurry product photo while ranting about defective buttons? It‚Äôll actually *help* instead of roasting your photography skills.
- **Benchmark wars**: Top AI models are now graded on obscure tests like *GPQA Diamond* (no, not a jewelry rating). Spoiler: Claude Sonnet 3.7 is killing it (probably composing poetry while acing tests). [Benchmark nerd talk](https://www.christopherspenn.com/2025/03/mind-readings-how-to-benchmark-and-evaluate-generative-ai-models-part-1-of-4/?pk_campaign=feed&pk_kwd=mind-readings-how-to-benchmark-and-evaluate-generative-ai-models-part-1-of-4).

My issues started this past fall, I noticed my stool was very oily but normal color. I didn‚Äôt have health insurance at the time so I changed my diet up and the symptoms seemed to get better, I was also have bad tummy pain sometimes but everything seemed to get better with diet change and fasting.  Fast forward to thanksgiving and I indulged in a lot of foods I don‚Äôt normally eat.. also pretty much the whole month of December.. had a lot of stomach aches but they would always go away so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. But that all changed when I had a bad stomach ache attack on January 2nd.. it is not gone back to normal since then and things have gotten worse.. I noticed pain after eating everything.. even a few bites or plain chicken and rice could cause pain in my stomach, right side or chest.. I‚Äôve cut out all coffee, caffeine, processed foods etc.. my diet is very bland.. I didn‚Äôt go in right away because I didn‚Äôt have insurance in january( I do now) if I ate too much in one sitting or too close together it could set off a flare I call it.. reduced all fat because I kept thinking gallbladder..laying in my right side with a castor oil pack and heat has helped it.. but it seems to have gotten worse week by week.. sometimes I had a bit of caffeine or a small amount of coffee or one day I tried rice cakes and things are not seeming to bounce back only getting worse.. my gut feels extremely sensitive to everything.. along with that is right side pain.. I also have yellow oily stools everyday.. after going in the morning my stomach and right side tense up bad.. it almost ruins my whole day from the pain and I have to eat and drink very little.. even water can upset it.. I‚Äôve lost so much weight in 2 months and my period( not pregnant) I finally got insurance saw a primary and she tested me for h pylori and it was negative.. then blood work.. my lipase normal but amylase was 120(slightly elevated) .. I don‚Äôt see a gi until the 18th. I ended up in the er a week ago.. they did a right side ultrasound which showed a few stones in gallbladder but it was overflowing or inflamed he said.. lipase normal.. bile ducts clear etc.. he told me it‚Äôs likely gastritis and put me on 40 mg protonix..I‚Äôm at a loss..my weight keeps getting lower and lower.. I also have to puree all my food because it seems to be easier on my gut.. but now it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm tolerating less and less.. the doctor gave me some hydrocodone but I‚Äôm  afraid to touch because how sensitive my gut is..I‚Äôm now thinking  possibly fat malabsorption maybe? Or maybe Epi? I also have N appointment for a hida scan soon

Pain is mainly epigasteic but there‚Äôs also always a very tender spot to the right.. pain can also travel to left sometimes.. can wrap around my back or break through to the center of my back

He seemed a good enough distance away for it to not be weird and was walking pretty slow already. So I let the door shut without holding it for him, and as he passed me to go in, he says ‚Äúthank youuu, really appreciate that. Would‚Äôve taken you two fucking second to hold the fucking door for me‚Äù in a real bitchy tone. I just kept walking and left, kinda shocked. As I‚Äôm back out on the main road literally 1-2 minutes later, i see his car driving up really close to mine, freaked me out, so i look over and it‚Äôs him and he is flipping me off lol. I flipped him off back because i feel that nobody is entitled to getting the door held open for them all the time. I usually do hold the door for people when it makes sense and 100% of the time for older people or anyone who might need assistance. 


For context: i was pulling into the parking lot at the same time as him and he was taking forever to park because he was backing in üòë so i already parked a few spaces away since he was taking up half the parking lot to back in. Only mentioning this because i noticed he was a slow individual- hence one reason i didn‚Äôt hold the door open if he was gonna be a while to get in. 
Additionally, while i was walking out of the shop, i had a drink in each of my hands as well as my phone and a bag with a croissant. So my hands are full and im opening the door to leave with my elbow. 

Anyway, i was a bit heated and shook since i never have these types of interactions with people but in a way felt bad because i should‚Äôve just held it open. I swear this was like the 1 time i didn‚Äôt , and i didn‚Äôt realize it was that important to everyone? AITAH?

The leadership of the SED and DDR has begun to receive disturbing reports. While the acquisition and importation of luxury goods has always been, tricky to say the least, for the DDR, the situation has begun to worsen for one of the most important luxury goods of all: coffee. No German household is complete without coffee on a regular basis. Yet, recently troubling harvests abroad, rising import costs, and a shaky supply of foreign currency, which must be prioritized for petroleum, mean that we will have a hard time getting sufficient quantities of coffee soon.¬†



Unfortunately, like with the earlier situation with Somalia, many countries are unwilling to trade large amounts of exports for the various wonderful industrial and military goods that we can offer them. How strange. But thankfully, there is someone who can help us! Our friend in Vietnam: just recently unified.¬†



Now that the capitalist roaders in Saigon have been defeated, the Central Highlands of Vietnam have been made available. These highlands are well suited to growing the Robusta coffee strain at high volumes. Additionally, Vietnam is much more likely to accept what we have to offer, given our past friendship and compatible economic and political systems.¬†

And all I did was politely request my morning chin scritches like I do every day.

Every morning, I exercise my right to lapbed time while the great oaf drinks her coffee (a mysterious drink also known as 'don't you dare knock that over, you miserable shit'). An important part of honouring the housekeeper with my presence is the tradition of chin scritches. Sometimes I like a good five-minute session, but sometimes her technique is lacking and I end the session early by deploying the *bitebitebite* \- a perfectly reasonable method of catmunication.

For some reason I cannot fathom, despite my vast intellect and knowledge of human behaviour, when I ~~demanded~~ politely requested my morning chin scritches the other day, she responded with 'There's no way I'm touching you, you horrible little cloaca. You're going to bite me the moment I do.' And then, to add insult to inadequacy, she removed herself from the bed entirely and went to sit on the couch. Such disrespect! 

She claims that I had resting bite face and I had just bitten her in the shin while she was using the human litter box. I mean, of course I did because how else will she learn, but that had nothing to do with my polite request for chin scritches. I was even purring to show her that I was ready for our morning ritual, and I was flicking my tail only because that's an important part of my morning calisthenics. 

I can't imagine a universe in which I could possibly be the cloaca. She was definitely being the cloaca for neglecting her duties as my ~~slave~~ personal assistant. The dog, as always, is a cloaca for existing, and this time, for leaving with her before I could *bapbapbap* his snoot to ensure compliance throughout the day (another integral part of my morning ritual).",23,1741368626.0,AmItheCloaca,8,1.0,False

1j5ud45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AWDTSGisToxic/comments/1j5ud45/very_toxic/,Very toxic.,"For instance:

So to start, I am in no form of committed relationship. I am not fully dating anyone, i have talked to a few individuals,  but nothing serious. A few dates here and there but nothing locked in or major.

I had hinge and in here is where I had spoken to a few people. Little did I know meeting someone off here would be absolutely horrendous and unnerving.

I had matched with a woman, older, of which was looking for ""Short Term Relationship, Open to long"". 
For starters, I am fully aware that we both have a dating app. I am aware that she likely has men contacting her and she could be talking to them.

That is not my business. If she is talking to some people's. Go ahead, we are not committed. We are not exclusive,  I have no hold on you to where you cannot go and talk to others. I don't believe it's common for a person to download a dating app and solely conversate with one person. 

As a man, if I go on a date and expect you to exclusive to me immediately,  then I'm sure social media would rip me a new ass out of backlash, but I digress. 

I began speaking to this woman online and the conversation was...ok. Nothing that really stood out or really captivated me but I couldn't really call it bad. After a couple days she wanted to switch to Snapchat to which I agreed. On there, the experience was about the same. It was lukewarm, maybe a hint of spice, but nothing special. 
She kept urging to meet but I was cautious as something just didn't feel right. Eventually I gave in and decides to go get coffee together one morning before she went to work. We met at a local coffee shop, where I bought us food and coffee, and we sat and spoke for about 20 minutes. The conversation was a little better in person but still something didn't feel right, like my gut didn't feel right. As we are heading out and get to the parking lot to tell our goodbyes, she stands there staring at face inching closer and closer and closer. She blatantly wanted a kiss, and sure enough we both leaned in for a quick one. I'm not a huge fan of that kind of pda, especially to a new date. So I only left it at one. It did feel nice but overall the date wasn't that special, as not even a week later it honestly faded out of my mind. In the days after, she asked first my number and i obliged. We talked a little but I just wasnt feeling it. The vibe wasn't there as it just seemed to fade out.

Then, in just over a week since the coffee date,  is when I was hit with the news: I had been posted in THAT group. 
'Are we dating the same Guy?'

I was mortified. As I had said, yes I had talked to more than one individual but nothing overtly serious. Nothing concrete, nothing set in stone. There was no one that i told was exclusive to only me, abd they could talk to whomever as well, as we weren't dating.

But this post absolutely sent me through an anxiety induced mess. I can understand if I was a boyfriend or a husband but i was posted after ONE COFFEE DATE?! 

I'm just sick, embarrassed, a knot in my stomach and feel publicly shamed. Most the comments, I'm told, were supportive with a few being neutral or even less being negative.

After a few hours the past was taken down but it was spread across FIVE GROUPS. Again, I'm told it was taken down but the damage is already there. It didn't take much detective work to figure out it was her, and confronted her about it. To which she was appalled and called me a ""women back stabber"" and we both blocked each other.

I NEVER said her and I were exclusive. She had every right to talk to whomever she wanted, she could go on 9 dates that day, I didn't care! We were fresh in talking, that was our FIRST and ONLY time meeting and yet you go and post me on a loaded page, to which I cannot defend my side of the story, like I'm a boyfriend or husband. 

This whole experience has left me mortified and embarrassed,  sick to my stomach. I do not have hinge nor will I use a dating app ever again as I feel this is finally the nail in the coffin for me as far as online dating goes. 

This makes me feel even more cautious about going into the dating field as it has left me disgusted. 

To whomever sees this, please be cautious the next time you go on a date. You genuinely have zero idea what someone may say or do, no matter the amount of time you've known them.",6,1741368502.0,AWDTSGisToxic,3,1.0,False

Warning: long story, but TL;DR below.

I used a dating website for bi women. My first date was with a woman who was always slow with responding to texts. I had to wait for days, sometimes weeks to receive her answer. So it was more like writing letters. But she was beautiful.  
We didn't hit it off on our first date and didn't continue for a second. It was frustrating because we had so much in common. But I wasn't discouraged yet.

Some time later I started e-mailing with some one. We had a first date after three or four weeks. It was amazing. But she had a busy life, she was always over-analyzing every feeling and every moment we had. It drove me nuts. After the fourth date our chemisty was almost gone and she admitted she wanted to fall in love with some one. I was looking for a friends with benefits dynamic.

A short time after this I found a lovely and sexy woman. She was married and had two small children and had a busy life. Her husband got jealous quite fast and wasn't so supportive as she expected. After two months we took a break. We had a deeper connection but no romantic feelings. 

October 2023 I started chatting with a beautiful woman. She was everything I was looking for. Our second date was hot and intense. A short while after this date she texted me that her husband cheated on her and that she needed time alone to work things out. Also, she was busy with her career (which was taking flight at the time).  
I gave her space and in the months that followed I asked her a few times how she was doing. She did want to meet up for coffee, but always cancelled at the last minute. Our conversations never went on for more than a few texts. I never saw her again and I gave up, I realized I had a big crush on her and it was hard to let her go. 

But alright, I reconnected with the married woman. She was divorcing her husband and bought an apartment. Things did get better for a while, but her new job had irregular working hours and she lived an hour away from me. Her children are too young and need a lot of care still.   
Everything in her life was unstable. Her new boyfriend wasn't supportive either.   
Our lives just don't match and her communication style (slow and erratic) was annoying me.

By the end of 2024 I got on Feeld.  
Wow, it looked like a candy store full of ENM women!  
My first date (just lunch) was with a lovely bi-curious woman. She wanted to hook up the next week.  
She cancelled because she had the flu. She wanted to reschedule but a few hours before our date she cancelled again, because she said she wasn't ready to date a woman. I understood and suggested we go out for lunch. But she never responded. Didn't block me either but that's about it.

I still like Feeld (and paid for a Majestic membership) but I get so many likes from couples who are looking for a third. I'm not interested in that. Occasionally I match with a woman, but most of the time they don't live near by (which is what I'm looking for), she's way too sexually orientated, it's a fake profile or she ghosts me after a few sentences.

The ghosting was the biggest issue on the first dating site I got on. They just stop responding. I don't know why. I have also made other contacts over time, but they came to nothing.

Every time my hart skips a beat when I see some one I'm interested in. I have nice photos, I clearly write what I am looking for, I'm not incredible picky with age or looks. I don't think I'm the complicated one.

**TL;DR** I‚Äôve been using different dating platforms for bi women, but finding a stable connection has been challenging. My first dates were with women who were slow to respond or emotionally unavailable, which was frustrating despite having much in common. A promising connection with a married woman eventually fell apart due to her unstable situation and poor communication. On Feeld, the options seemed exciting at first, but most matches are couples looking for a third or women who aren‚Äôt actually available. Despite being clear about what I‚Äôm looking for and keeping an open mind, I experience a lot of ghosting, and finding a real, compatible connection remains difficult.",1,1741368087.0,EthicalNonMonogamy,4,1.0,False

I've gone from +60k P&L to -50k in three short months, with margin trades in VOO, SPY, TSLA, S&P, Crypto. 

We've yet to see the true effects of the tariffs and other looming policies being spilled out each day by this administration, and whether or not you agree with the implications of these policies, the bearish volatility in the market is extremely concerning. 

I'm liquidating now and I suggest you do the same, until things settle, whenever that is. With that being said, this will set us up for great opportunity to re-enter the market for a correction- whenever that presents itself. I don't see any reason for this to happen anytime in the next 30 days, and I refuse to lose another $5k every morning before I even have my first cup of coffee. 

I'll take the 4.2% in high yield savings all day over this. 

The world economy is bracing for a storm, whether short or prolonged is yet to be seen, but if you're in a buying mindset right now I hope you're in a position for a long hold.

1j5tzzu,https://tedplansdiy.com/?hopId=a2a96742-dc81-464b-a99e-5987c86952e7&,The Unexpected Gift,"A few years ago, James found himself in a situation that many can relate to ‚Äì stuck in a routine that left him feeling disconnected from his passions. Working long hours at an office job, he barely had time to relax, let alone enjoy something creative. He missed the days when he was young and would spend hours building small projects with his father in the garage. There was something about creating something with his hands that brought him peace, even joy.

One Saturday morning, after a particularly draining week, he stumbled upon an old toolbox in his basement, forgotten beneath piles of unused things. A wave of nostalgia hit him, and he immediately thought, ‚ÄúI should get back into woodworking.‚Äù

But where to start? He had no formal training, just a love for working with wood. Looking for inspiration, he scrolled through some DIY blogs and stumbled upon a guide that seemed different from all the others. It wasn‚Äôt just a set of vague instructions‚Äîit was a step-by-step blueprint, guiding him through each project, no matter his skill level. This wasn‚Äôt just about making furniture; it was about rediscovering a part of himself that had been dormant for years.

Within a week, James built his first piece: a rustic bookshelf for his living room. The sense of accomplishment was unbelievable. What started as a simple way to pass time turned into a full-fledged hobby. Soon, he was crafting everything from a new coffee table to a custom garden bench, each piece better than the last. It wasn‚Äôt just the projects themselves that changed his life, but the quiet confidence that came with knowing he could create something beautiful with his own two hands.

James wasn‚Äôt alone. There were countless others like him‚Äîpeople who rediscovered the joy of woodworking, who started from scratch and built pieces that brought their homes to life. It wasn‚Äôt about perfection; it was about the process, the creativity, and the satisfaction of seeing something tangible emerge from raw materials.

And as James‚Äô skills improved, so did his connection to his family and friends. The handmade pieces became conversation starters, gifts, and cherished keepsakes. Little by little, the woodworking hobby turned into a life-altering passion. He didn‚Äôt just build furniture; he built memories, experiences, and a renewed sense of purpose.

James often finds himself thinking about how that one decision to start‚Äîone small step‚Äîchanged everything. He never thought that a simple project could do so much for his mind, body, and soul. But now, with a growing collection of handmade creations, James is living a life that is richer, more fulfilling, and more hands-on than ever.",0,1741367759.0,DIYUK,0,0.5,False

I (F28) have been married for past 4 years and have a son(M2). It was a love marriage and I stubbornly married despite my parents' disapproval. Initial days were quite good. We moved abroad after 2 years and we got pregnant there. But soon after my pregnancy things started changing. We started prioritising our parents and there was a continuous battle between us (my family and your family fights)

Things became toxic. The love between us started diminishing. He started developing hatred towards me. Everytime we came for vacation he would cancel the return ticket and stay and blackmail me of never going back. Last August we came to India to his place and after 10 days he left me and my kid at my parents place and said I needed counseling as I was making all fights big. We tried couple counselling but the moment the counsellor started asking us to spend time together and deprioritize other stuffs and asked him to make a few changes, he started defending and stopped the counselling. He did not even call me or came to see my son for about a month. After a great struggle we went back and he started giving me a weird treatment. He would not talk to me or even sit and have a coffee with me. He would wake up and leave for office and come home late. Even if he was home early we slept at different times he would sleep really late and would watch something on netflix.  We barely spoke. When I asked him to talk to me, he said I was overtaking everything and I had to come out of it. I felt like I was living with a roommate. He stopped helping me on the house chores too. 

We came back to India again this February and he demanded that we go to his place and he fought with me before his parents and they took his side and asked me to leave their house in the middle of the night and I came to my dad's place again... it has been a month since we spoke...  he stopped paying rent there and I was informed by the owner and I made a payment, he texted me saying that he is cancelling all the direct debit for utility bills.

Last month has been seriously devastating for me. I am afraid of how things are going to proceed. I don't want him either as I don't feel loved and all he showed was hatred towards me. But I am worried about my life and my son's life. My parents do support me.

Will I ever be able to lead a happy life?
What will happen to my future? Is single parenting hard?
Why does tragic things like this happen to people?
How will I raise my son alone?
I work abroad, but managing on single salary is not easy as I would be saving close to nothing. I can get a better financial state here in India. But I will have to face the stigma. What do I do? Should I go back with my 2 year old one alone and manage there?

So for context, I have autism, ADHD and emetophobia. I also understand that people have to make a living.

I've been going to this same diner since I moved to the area 7 years ago. It's always been great, I've never had issues with food or the service. 

 I was seated and ordered immediately as always. I've had this waitress before and she's always been great. Another waitress, her boyfriend, and my waitress's boyfriend were at the booth right in front of me. As soon as my waitress set down my food, she proceeded to tell the other waitress that she was up all last night getting sick out of both ends. I did overhear something about her drinking and smoking weed at the same time which has gotten me too. The other three at the booth looked like they had partied pretty good last night as well.

 I'm not going to fault someone for having a personal life and if she felt well enough to go to work I understand why she did. I'm fairly certain that it was her consumption of intoxicating things and not a stomach virus, but it still freaked me out because she's handling my plate and my coffee mug and norovirus is an oral fecal disease. 

I didn't say anything to her that I overheard her conversation but instead I composed myself as best I could and in my panicky state I told her that I misread my schedule and I'm going to be late for work. Asked for my food to go and the check. Paid and tipped like always to not draw attention. I'm basically just going to be dumping it all in the trash somewhere. I can't bring myself to eat it. 

I'm just a little frustrated. I know because I have visible piercings and tattoos that I look like I could also fit the type of someone that maybe doesn't make the best choices with over indulging. And like I said, I have when I was in my early twenties but I never ever said anything about that in front of customers. I kept that shit to myself and did the best I could to put myself together.

I am having obsessive thoughts about my current crush(es). I stalk their social media, go through their following lists, search for their name on Google and linked in. Wtf is wrong with me??

These obsessive thoughts are drastically reducing my productiveness and focus. And before you ask, no, I have been tested and I do not have OCD. 

I need a quick fix that can get me to the end of March. I have exams coming up and I cannot fail them.

PS: I know the best course of action is therapy, but atm I am living abroad and I do not have neither the time nor the money to see a professional. 

The current ""flare"" in obsessive thoughts is most likely linked to the coming exam session: I have been studying every day for the past 2 weeks. I am extremely bored, even if I study at the library and get regular coffee breaks to chat with people. ",0,1741366374.0,Advice,3,0.5,False

1j5t9jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cork/comments/1j5t9jn/need_to_settle_a_debate_about_dating_in_2025/,Need to settle a debate about dating in 2025,"It's a very short and simple question(s). Is it even worth using dating apps when you're looking for serious relationship, is it really THAT embarrassing to ask a guy/girl out or for their number/Instagram if you meet them at a club you're in (club as in running club etc not club as in night club)  or at a coffee shop 

I personally believe that dating apps are a waste of time for anyone who actually wants a serious relationship, not saying they haven't worked for some people I know people who definitely have met people on tinder, hinge etc but for the VAST majority of the userbase they are used for hook ups etc. my friend on my other hand swears by them and thinks he/she will find the LOTL on it. 

Now with that said I'm more in the camp of meeting someone on a night out or  in a club, sports that you may be apart of as if you don't drink that would be the next best idea because at least that way you are actually able to gauge what a person is like and not through a screen though text

And a question for the girls, would you prefer a guy to ask you on a date in that type of scenario (coming up to you in a coffee shop or if you know them through a club?) My friend says that it's to embarrassing for the guy / girl to ask in person because 9 times out of 10 then they will be made look like a fool but i personally believe it's one of those things they will think about for 5 minutes and forget because at the end of the day all  it was, was a  conversation that may or may not end in rejection, of course you might feel a bit disappointed but it wouldn't be life changing. 

TL;DR, in today's world is it better to meet someone on tinder with the goal of a serious relationship or is it better to meet them on a night out, at a club of some sorts? Girls which would you prefer, meet someone at a club and be asked on a date or meet that person on tinder and text them before deciding on meeting up. ",4,1741366255.0,cork,17,0.83,False

It's anaerobic 48h processed with flavor profile described by roaster being Blackberry, Sweet Porto Wine, Mango.  

I've been using coffee Chroniclers recipe for 20g of coffee with a great success. The final cup is greatly balanced when it comes to coffee bitterness and juicy acidity of fruits with little fermenty notes.   

Always after I finish my cup I open the switch to an empty cup to taste the last drops of coffee that I didn't extract. For those beans those drops were incredibly sweet and delicious. The question is how could I troubleshoot my recipe to make my final cup more similar to those last drops and maybe a little bit less juicy? For now I tried to close the switch earlier at 25 seconda to maybe make my final cup more influenced by the later parts of extraction and less on the early acidic parts, but the final cup was nowhere near close the explosion of sweetness of those last drops.

3. Water or acid coming from beneath my tongue 
4. Laying down used to help with the symptoms, walking or sitting made it difficult
5. There was never any burning feeling in throat or chest

1. Instead of occasionally, I feel the above mentioned symptoms pretty much every day 
2. The heavy feeling in throat is there. I cannot drink tea or coffee or even hot water as these things worsen the symptoms
3. Loud burping and belching if I don't lay down
4. Laying down still helps me improve the symptoms

I regretted opening up to her because, looking back, our friendship was always one-sided. She never initiated hanging out for years‚Äîuntil I had a miscarriage. I also started realizing she‚Äôs the kind of person who becomes BFFs with everyone at first, has a ton of surface-level friendships, and makes people think she‚Äôs super nice and awesome‚Ä¶ but there‚Äôs no depth. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the ‚Äúme too‚Äù thing‚Äîshe has something in common with everyone. And I also realize she‚Äôs the friend who makes all your hobbies her hobbies too for common interests.. so yeah.. A friend to all is a friend to none.

Anyway, flash forward:

I fall pregnant again, and I have an MMC at 9 weeks‚Äîone week before a group trip. This friend knows I‚Äôm still bleeding from the meds during the trip and is in charge of room assignments. She assigns me to a cabin with an outhouse and then, in front of 8 people, asks, ‚ÄúAre you okay with this?‚Äù Like‚Ä¶ what was I supposed to do? Announce to the group that I was literally clotting out of my body with a dilated cervix?!

I let it go because I was too emotionally drained. Later, I found out that an actual friend told her what she did to me. I have never received an apology.

After the trip, we grabbed coffee (which she initiated cuz guess what we‚Äôre now besties cuz we ‚Äúwant‚Äù babies üôÑ), and she was back on her baby fever talk. Then she actually said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll have a miscarriage because I‚Äôm young and healthy.‚Äù That was my breaking point. I mentally checked out of the friendship.

Then, surprise surprise, she gets pregnant exactly when she wants to. Her pregnancy is amazing, and she reminds everyone of that every step of the way. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm avoiding hangouts and distancing myself.

Baby comes. And guess what? None of her friends are there for her. After over a year of me pulling back, she suddenly asks me to hang out. Fine. I go. She tells me how difficult her pregnancy was (I‚Äôm like uhh? So why‚Äôd you lie for 9 months??) She also asks why I don‚Äôt talk to her anymore. I give her a brief overview‚Äîbecause my therapist told me not to relive my trauma for her benefit, especially when she‚Äôs already been told why I was upset by my actual friend. She asks if we can either be friends or just be civil in group settings. I agree.

She has not asked me to hang out since. But she hearts all my group chats and acts like we‚Äôre besties. It makes me sick. She is so fake. So, I stop putting effort into being civil‚ÄîI just remove myself from the situation entirely.

And now‚Ä¶ she invites me to her kid‚Äôs birthday party via FB.

WTF? Why would a grown woman and mom want someone who isn‚Äôt her friend at her kid‚Äôs birthday? Am I crazy for questioning why she wants to pass on a toxic friendship to her son??? I honestly think I was invited just so she could boost her numbers‚Äîbecause, at the end of the day, she cares more about status and popularity than actual friendships.

And the shame‚Ä¶","I still have contact with my parents. I started pulling away when I reached my 40s and as I have raised my own children it really brought to light the abuse they perpetrated. We don't have an honest and communicative relationship (shocker) and I am fearful of confrontation (emotionally not physically). 
Thus, I've never spoken to them about the problems. They live local to me and are at least surface interested in my children. I keep a facade of relationship but I'm sure they know there is disconnection. My husband is big on communication and encourages me to have a conversation with them. He is well aware of the problems and in fact, was the one who gently helped me see that I had experienced abuse. I don't feel that I can or that it would  change anything anyway, to tell them about how I feel.
I see my mom a few times a month--I take her grocery shopping. They occasionally come to my home for coffee or dinner. I talk about my children or a bit of current events/politics. I pretend and I am relieved when they go home. I do not speak to my dad outside of those times. He is frightening on the phone and doesn't like to text. In person he mostly keeps to himself. 
They don't ask about anything important to me or anything about how my life is and I don't offer. I don't ask them either and my mom mainly shares about the various health concerns of friends and family. They're in their 70s so there's a lot of that. 
I don't get the sense that they really love me. Not the way I love my children. They would say they do, would probably say they are sad or didn't understand why I am distant but they have *never once* asked me. If my children pulled away from me I would do everything I could to see what went wrong and what I could do to repair things. I couldn't just let them go. It would break me to not have a real relationship with them. I would miss them so terribly. My parents... they just seem to pretend not to notice. 
As I said, they're in their 70s and my dad has health issues so we don't have a lot of time ahead. I feel ashamed that I don't care that much myself. It's easier not to be around them but the shame over not truly altering to them and going to them to tell them what is wrong is pretty big. 
Any input? Open to advice, others' stories, commiserations. Thanks all. This was long and I feel new to this.

I genuinely considered myself to be the last person to be in this position, but alas here I am and am hoping that someone can share their wisdom with me. 

I'm currently an M2 at a US MD. I moved across the country away from family and friends to be at my top choice school, and while adjusting to school during M1 was brutal at times, I felt that I had finally found my niche, was doing research projects in my specialty of interest, and was making the most of my new life. 

M2 was going good until late December, when I started developing strange pains and pinches in my arms and legs, followed by headaches. I've never been sick for more than a week, so when these symptoms persisted even with regular sleep, exercise, and water, I decided it was time to get it checked out. After multiple blood tests and even an EMG, I was told that it was probably just related to ""stress and caffeine intake,"" even though my stress and the amount of coffee I drank never led to a problem like this in the past.

From January till now, the pains, pinches, and headaches have been occurring daily, and insomnia has been added to the mix too. Even though I can still drive, cook, shower, etc, I've been finding it difficult to study for more than 2-3 hours each day. Despite trying medications to minimize this and also staying away from coffee and tea, I'll still feel these symptoms, even during exams, and it's beyond distracting and disheartening.

All of this is to say that I've developed such a loss of appetite for medical school. I once looked forward to starting each day learning and spending time with my classmates, and now all I can think about is when will things end; the symptoms, the anxiety, the constant test-taking, and the grind of medicine that once seemed manageable but no longer does.

While I'm grateful for the friends and classmates I have at school, I find myself missing my support network at home more than ever, and have gone from being happy with my school choice to now deeply regretting not attending my state school close to home. And if things are hard now, I can't imagine how much harder they will be in third and fourth year.

I've started therapy to help with managing my mental health, and while it's been helpful, I still find myself questioning whether or not continuing down this path is right for me. I chose med school over PA or nursing because of how much I loved surgery (worked in an OR for years prior to med school), but now I can't imagine a future where I'm healthy and driven enough to pursue that.

I feel trapped; I want to be healthier, but despite everything I've done, not much has changed. I want to do good in school, but my physical and mental health are holding me back. I want to take a leave of absence, but if I move back across the country, I'll have to give up my apartment and I don't know if I want to go through the ordeal of moving cross-country for school again. And my biggest question: if I do take the leave and decide I don't want to continue med school, what then? I understand these are such massive questions, but would seriously appreciate any insight, advice, or hope during this uncertain time.",4,1741365276.0,medicalschool,1,0.83,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

# Define Your Goals

Before diving headfirst into the ocean of code, it's essential to know why you're taking the plunge. Are you:

* **Chasing a Career in IT**: Dreaming of that developer salary and unlimited coffee?
* **Solving Specific Problems**: Like automating your chores or building an app that reminds you to drink water (because hydration is key)?
* **Enhancing Cognitive Skills**: Hoping that coding will finally make you the human calculator you've always aspired to be?

Clarifying your goals will help you navigate the coding labyrinth more effectively.

# Choose Your First Programming Language

Selecting your first programming language is like choosing a starter Pok√©mon‚Äîit sets the tone for your journey:

* **Python**: The Bulbasaur of languages‚Äîreliable, versatile, and great for beginners.
* **JavaScript**: Charmander‚Äîfiery and essential for web development.
* **Java**: Squirtle‚Äîrobust and widely used in enterprise solutions.

Pick the one that aligns with your aspirations (and spirit animal).

# Set Up Your Development Environment

Time to turn your computer into a coding command center:

* **Install Necessary Software**: Compilers, interpreters, and that text editor everyone keeps talking about.
* **Choose a Text Editor or IDE**: Think of it as choosing between a Swiss Army knife or a lightsaber.
* **Learn Basic Command Line Operations**: Because real coders type commands like they're in ""The Matrix.""

# Learn the Fundamentals of Programming

Every coder's foundation is built on these core concepts:

* **Variables and Data Types**: Think of variables as boxes where you store your snacks (data).
* **Conditional Statements**: The ""choose your own adventure"" parts of coding.
* **Loops**: For when you want your computer to do the same thing over and over, like reminding you to stand up every hour.
* **Functions**: The reusable recipes in your coding cookbook.

Master these, and you'll be on your way to coding stardom (or at least less confused Googling).

# Practice with Small Projects

Start small before attempting to build the next Facebook:

* **Implement Simple Projects**: Like a calculator that only adds numbers (baby steps).
* **Participate in Coding Challenges**: The coding equivalent of Sudoku puzzles.
* **Study Others' Code**: Peek into someone else's brain and realize you're not alone in the struggle.

# Join Developer Communities

Remember, even lone wolves sometimes need a pack:

* **Forums and Groups**: Where you can ask questions and realize everyone else is just as lost.
* **Local Meetups and Hackathons**: Free pizza, swag, and networking‚Äîwhat's not to love?

Engaging with others can provide support, motivation, and the occasional meme to keep you going.

# Continue Learning and Improving

The tech world evolves faster than fashion trends:

* **Learn New Languages and Frameworks**: Because who doesn't love adding more to their plate?
* **Stay Updated with Trends**: So you can nod knowingly when someone mentions the latest JavaScript framework.
* **Contribute to Open Source Projects**: Give back to the community and earn some internet karma points.

Continuous learning ensures you remain relevant and ready to tackle new challenges (or at least understand the latest tech jokes).

Starting your coding journey might seem daunting, but remember: every expert was once a beginner who didn't know the difference between Java and JavaScript. Embrace the process, laugh at your mistakes, and code on!

**Why This Pick?**

The Kings are back at home tonight, friends ‚Äì and having won 4 of their last 5 games, I see them bagging a comfortable win over the Spurs this evening (who by the way, are still without Wemby‚Ä¶). San Antonio really seems to struggle on the road ‚Äì and having lost 5 of their last 7 outings, it really only makes sense to lay the cash on the home squad. To boot, Sacramento beat the Spurs by a whopping 27 points in their last meeting ‚Äì I have a feeling tonight‚Äôs encounter will yield a similar result. Give me the Kings to cover.

Around 6ish months ago, my husband got a promotion at work and offered to allow me to stay home and pursue some of my other interests I‚Äôd never been given the chance to. 

I absolutely want to go all out for our anniversary for him. He has given me/us the life of our dreams, and works his ass off for it. As we don‚Äôt have kids, I handle 100% of the house work currently and love making sure he comes home to nothing to do but relax. (Since this is reddit, that being said on weekends, he gets up before me, takes care of our animals and brings me coffee in bed) 
 
I make some money from the interests I‚Äôve been working on, but as it‚Äôs still in the works, it‚Äôs not a ton. Is there something, card, action, etc. that your non-working or only semi working wives get you for holidays and anniversaries that you really enjoy receiving? This is the first event we‚Äôre having where my budget is pretty tight, only because I don‚Äôt want to ask him for $ for a gift for him. It just feels kinda wrong to technically have him ‚Äúpay‚Äù for any of it. Yk? Not that he would gaf lol. 

I have always been a more sentimental gift giver type, but not in this exact situation and i want to switch it up from my usual things. Just wanted to see if there was any particularly unique ideas y‚Äôall‚Äôs wives had that you really appreciated.

*The Frank E. Merriweather Jr. Library on Jefferson Ave was bustling with activity Wednesday night as 9 candidates for Buffalo mayor attended a forum hosted by the East Side Collaborative Partnership and We Are Women Warriors.*

*The nearly 3-hour event began as a town hall where candidates for mayor heard East Side residents express their concerns about issues that were important to them.*¬†

*After that, a forum was held where the audience asked candidates specific policy questions.*¬†

*Several hundred members of the community turned out to hear from the following candidates:*

* *NYS Senator, and Democratic Party endorsed candidate, Sean Ryan*
* *GOP endorsed candidate James Gardner*
* *Acting Mayor Chris Scanlon*
* *Garnell Whitfield Jr.*¬†
* *Council member Rasheed N.C. Wyatt*
* *Michael Gainer*
* *Terry Robinson*
* *James Payne*¬†
* *Maggie Harter*

*At times, candidates struggled to follow the questioning from audience members, as many of the questions were directed at a specific person. Very little policy initiatives were shared with the audience by the candidates.*¬†

*Humboldt Parkway resident and candidate Terry Robinson had the clearest policy of the candidates, which was the removal of the Kensington Expressway.*¬†

*""Without a doubt it is the single most pressing financial and environmental issue facing this city,"" Robinson said.*¬†

*One of the questions from the audience was directed at Senator Sean Ryan, but eventually answered by the entire field of candidates, and pertained to the process in which the Erie County Democratic Committee endorsed his campaign.*¬†

*On February 20th, party chairman Jeremy Zellner announced that Senator Ryan would be getting the nomination, two full days before the committee planned to formally vote on an endorsement.*

*""I spent two and a half months knocking on committee members doors,"" Senator Ryan said in response to the question about the process. ""I've had more coffees I could think about. At the end of that process, the committee members voted to have me be the endorsed candidate. So, I'm proud of the work that I did to achieve that, and I'm really proud to be the standard bearer for the Democratic Party.""*

*The other candidates, however, used the opportunity to criticize the process.*¬†

*""I know one thing for sure about Jeremy, he's a liar,"" said educator and candidate James Payne. ""I remember what my grandmother said, when somebody brings you all of these promises and stuff like that, you need to watch the dog and bring that bone. I think it's corrupt.""*

*Buffalo Reuse founder, East Side advocate and candidate Michael Gainer emphasized that the committee needs drastic changes.*¬†

*""The point of the matter is the democratic process is corrupted, and what we need to do is take it back, and we take it back by at the committee level,"" Gainer said. ""In our neighborhoods and starting to take back power and change in these rules.""*

*Maggie Harter, who says she may be the first transexual mayoral candidate in Buffalo history, echoed the sentiment about the Democratic party process.*¬†

*""I'm a Working Families Party supporter, rank and file, that's my allegiance primarily, "" Harter said. ""I'm not allowed to register as a Working Families Party candidate because I need to compete in the Democratic party election, which basically decided for the election, so yeah, there's some problems.""*

*GOP endorsed candidate James Gardner used the opportunity to sway voters into switching parties.*¬†

*""If you don't like the way the Democratic Party does business, come on over,"" Gardner said. ""You want your voices to be heard? You want your concerns to be raised? Come on over.""*

*Gardner was promptly booed and jeered by the crowd.*¬†

*He did receive some positive mumblings amongst the crowd at a later point when he emphasized one of his marquee issues of the campaign was to address the vacant lot problem.*

*""When you have the amount of open space that we have here, and the amount of people who are subjected to living in bad apartments, to me, there's a perfect opportunity to get some of those people into homes of their own so that they can build true wealth,"" Gardner said.*¬†

*Gardner did not outline how that plan would work or any potential costs associated with it.*¬†

*Potholes were another big topic for those in attendance, as they were critical that Jefferson Avenue, in their eyes, hasn't received much attention from city hall.*¬†

*Council Member Wyatt referenced a recent caucus meeting wherein DPW Commissioner Nate Marton said that they haven't pulled the pin for approving excessive overtime for addressing potholes this season.*¬†

*""We have to do overtime,"" Wyatt said. ""I don't think anybody in here would be upset with overtime to fill those potholes, because you're it's almost like going into a river.*

*Acting Mayor Chris Scanlon rebuffed, saying that there's plenty of ways to manage DPW staff to get potholes addressed during normal operating hours.*¬†

*""When it comes to fixing them, it doesn't require overtime, and I can tell you that firsthand,"" Scanlon said. ""We got creative over the course of the past couple weeks, pulling laborers from other departments in addition to public works, and tripling our crews that have been out doing blitzes the last few weekends, addressing them, starting this week, we have private contractors coming and heed them.""*

*Scanlon also said that one of the problems at this point in the season, is that cold patch is only a temporary fix.*¬†

*""I find it very rich that the very people who have helped create these issues, have not taken accountability for it up here, I find that very rich,"" said former Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield Jr. ""The streets were bad before the winter.""*¬†

*Whitfield says that the DPW is under budget by more than $2M because the department hasn't filled vacancies.*¬†

*""And guess what they did with the money allocated for those, ask that question, that's the game,"" Whitfield said. ""I know the game because I played it, I know how this works, I know how it works, trust me.""*

*Senator Ryan used the pitch that the same people who have been in office with the Common Council, namely Scanlon and Wyatt, are part of the status quo that has kept the East Side in the rear view mirror.*¬†

*""Does anyone here think the East Side he's got a fair shake in the last 20 years?"" Ryan asked the crowd. ""Does anyone think the East Side got fair sidewalk money, \[or\]Street Money, \[or\] pothole money, \[or\]pool money, \[or\] playground money?""*

*The crowd emphatically chanted no to each of those questions,*

*""So we got to turn the page, we got to turn the page and get fresh leadership into City Hall,"" Ryan said. ""That's what this is about.""*

*Candidates are now in the process of getting petitions signed in order to appear on the June primary ballot. Those petitions have to be turned in at the beginning of April to the county Board of Elections.*¬†",0,1741364123.0,Buffalo,6,0.38,False
