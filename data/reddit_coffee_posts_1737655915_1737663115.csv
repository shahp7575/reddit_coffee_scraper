I’m early 30s and picked this habit up during the pandemic. I’d normally use disposable vapes. A standard geekbar would last me anywhere between 15 - 20 days. It originally started as hitting someone’s vape during drinking, then hitting it even when not drinking, then got my own, and finally started vaping during the day.

Working from home made vaping even easier.

I’m 21 days clean. First week was pretty terrible. I was irritable, had brain fog, wasn’t really feeling like myself. Sleep quality at night was also terrible. 

Now, sleep quality at night has shot up. Cravings are at a bare minimum. My cardio recovery improved as per my Apple Watch from from 25 to 32 in the last 3 weeks.

Things that are working for me:
1. Long walks to clear my mind
2. Lots of water
3. Coffee during the day
4. Some sweets here and there

Hoping to stay clean from now on. Nicotine is one hell-uva drug. ",1,1737662959.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False

As the title states, I believe I am being heavily influenced by instagram and am interested in starting my espresso journey (Probably with a Breville Bambino Plus). I currently use a Moka Pot each morning since I no longer own a coffee machine. I also have a percolator which I havent dialed in yet and mostly collects dust. 

While I enjoy a cup of coffee, I drink it more out of a necessity than a love for it (or maybe I do love it?). I do own a grinder and do seek out high quality beans. I am the only coffee drinker in my household. I drink it black and make it americano style after brewing in the moka. 

If I were to start an espresso journey I would be making espresso 70 percent of the time Americano Style, 20 Percent straight up and 10 percent latte. Now this sounds like I have already made my decision but I am wondering if in the long run Ill get sucked in and enjoy the espresso journey or realize I didnt need to go there and maybe could have made my coffee a different way based on how I consume it. I am very undecided on this matter and wanted to know this communities thoughts. 

Thanks!

1i8cmm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indianlaw/comments/1i8cmm4/your_rights_simplified_indian_law_for_a_common_man/,"Your Rights, Simplified: Indian Law for a Common Man","Let’s be honest—legal jargon has always left most people utterly baffled. To most Indians, the entire Indian legal system appears to be a maze, filled with complex terms and processes hardly comprehensible except to lawyers. That's where **Indian Law for a Common Man by Sree Krishna Seelam** steps in. The book is reminiscent of a friend helping you through mental roadblocks, offering a step-by-step tutorial on the basics of Indian law.

With this book, you can learn the core principles of Indian law in three hours flat! From constitutional interpretation to criminal, civil, property, and cyberspace law, readers are presented with all the essentials explained in lucid, conversational language.

But the journey doesn’t end there. It also discusses what you owe society—an essential balance to cultivate in a society that often adopts a ""look but don’t touch"" attitude when precedence clashes with personal interests.

One of the book's greatest strengths is its conversational tone. Sree Krishna Seelam unravels intricate topics of law in such a manner that it feels like a conversation with a friend over coffee. He simplifies fundamental rights into digestible concepts with clarity and precision.

It’s not just theoretical either. The author provides practical advice on how to navigate legal challenges, such as filing a case, settling disputes, and protecting oneself from cybercrime. Given his approach to such a complex subject—breaking it down into relatable, coffee chat-like discussions—it’s hard not to applaud this book.

For instance, Sree Krishna Seelam condenses complex legal concepts, like the Right to Equality and the Right to Freedom, into clear, easily absorbed ideas. Furthermore, the book imparts essential knowledge about applying the law, from initiating a suit or grievance to protecting oneself against cybercrime.

What makes this book truly stand out is its accessibility. It’s not just for students or legal enthusiasts; it’s for everyone. A homemaker, a professional, an activist, or anyone curious about their rights can benefit from it. If you’ve ever been intimidated by the legal system, this book will change that. It empowers you with knowledge and demonstrates that the law isn’t something to fear but a shield to protect you.

Finally, **Indian Law for a Common Man** is not just a book; it’s a source of empowerment and awareness. In a world where ignorance often leads to exploitation, this book provides knowledge and actionable information to help individuals protect themselves and others.

If you’ve ever thought, “I wish I understood my rights better,” this book is the perfect starting point. Its insights may be straightforward, but their impact will stay with you for a lifetime. Highly recommended! **Grab your copy here:** [**https://amzn.in/d/fa4ZgL2**](https://amzn.in/d/fa4ZgL2) **.**

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DWKf5RqU-s

**DISCLAIMER**

I am not a doctor.  Below is what worked for me.  Always partner with your doctor before doing something like this.

**PREMISE**

Everything here is centered around controlling/reducing insulin, and elimination of insulin resistance.  Insulin dysfunction is at the center of most ailments nowadays, including obesity, diabetes, heart conditions, Alzheimer’s and even cancer.  The body produces insulin in response to the presence of glucose in the blood, so that’s the primary mechanism we’ll use below to control insulin.  For more information on this search for podcasts/articles by Jason Fung and Robert Lustig.  Their interviews on Diary of a CEO are literally life changing.



This routine has three components: diet, fasting, and exercise.   Hands down fasting is most important, diet second, and exercise third.



**FASTING**

Fasting gives your body a break from processing macronutrients.  One the carb side, the reduction in glucose will give you long periods without insulin.  Insulin is a storage horomone used to store glucose into fat.  Your body cannot burn fat while insulin is high, so fasts allow your body to be able to pull energy from fat.



Additionally, fasting gives you a break from protein ingestion, which forces your body to recycle malformed cells/tissue internally, a process known as autophagy.



There are several types of fasts.  Many people refer to “intermittent fasting” with notation as 16:8, 18:6, 20:4.  The first number is how long you go without food, the second is your eating window.  Some people refer to these schemes as “time restricted eating” and will reserve the term “fasting” for extended fasts of 24 hours or more.



There’s also OMAD (one meal a day) which is basically a 23:1 fast.  And there’s ADF where you fast completely every other day, which looks a lot like 36:12.  And you can do one-off 24, 36, 48, or 72 hour fasts.



On a fast, you can consume water, carbonated water, black coffee, or green tea.  And that’s it.  For fasts longer than 24 hours you may feel cramping, heart palpitations, headaches, or faint.  This is a sign of low electrolytes.  You need to consume electrolytes during a long fast (every 12-18 hours).  I use LMNT brand.


You will feel hungry during these fasts, but hunger isn't pain.  You can often eliminate hunger by going for a walk, having some electrolytes, or having some carbonated water.  Or just wait a few hours and it'll fade.  


**My Scheme:** I did a modified ADF, fasting for 36 hours, 2-3 times a week.  Usually Friday, Sunday, and Wednesday, but sometimes that varied.  On non fasting days, I ate during a 12:12 window, usually from 7:30a to 7:30p.



I had to build up to this.  I started by doing a 16 hour fast just on Sundays, and 12:12 every other day.  Every Sunday, I added an hour to the fast until I was at a full 24 hours.  After 4 weeks of that, I jumped to my first 36 hour fast.  It was super hard.  The following week I did it again, and it was less hard, and continued to get easier.  After a couple months of a weekly 36 hour fast I started to add a second day (Wednesday), by first doing a 16 hour fast that day, then the next week doing an OMAD that day, then the next week making it a 36 hour fast.


In general I’ve found the easiest fasts are sleep-to-sleep fasts where I stop eating before bed, fast the entire next day, go to bed fasted, and eat again after waking up.  This matches a 36 hour and 60 hour pattern.  Anything where I stop eating early in the day, or I have to wait most of the day before breaking my fast… just doesn’t work for me.  That matches 24, 48, and 72 hours.



I break the fast easy, with either an avocado, kimchi, some kefir, or scrambled eggs.  You’ll want to be near a toilet for a few hours your first few times.


I’ve done two longer fasts at 60 hours, about 3 months apart, to kick me out of a plateau.  Those were crazy hard but it worked and I felt amazing for days after.  I’m going to reserve these to every 3-4 months.



**DIET**

I do a healthy keto diet.  I avoid sugar (including fruit), most starches (including bread, pasta, rice, and potatoes), seed oils (canola, safflower, sunflower, cottonseed, corn, peanut, soybean, “vegetable”), and ultra processed foods (all the chemicals).  I will eat some beans/lentils in moderation, infinite vegetables, and meat/egg/cheese.  You can put olive oil on things, but I don’t heat it up.  I cook with either tallow, ghee, coconut oil, or algae oil.



I don’t count calories ever.  I eat until I’m full.  I try not to snack too much and instead carbonate water helps me feel full if I want a snack.  My typical breakfast is steak and 4 eggs or a 6 egg omelette with cheese and bacon.  My typical lunch is a large salad with about a pound of salmon and no dressing, or pulled port on a pile of broccoli (no sugary sauces).  My usual dinner is a half a chicken (one breast, thigh, leg, and wing) with a bunch of sautéed veggies.  If I ever have a snack, its once in a day and it’s a small amount of jerky, some cheese, some peanuts/macadamia/pistachios, or celery with peanut butter (real stuff, no additives).



I will have a cheat meat every couple weeks or so: go out for pasta or have ice cream with my daughter.  This isn’t a cheat day, just a meal.  And I usually position it the day before a fast.



**EXERCISE**

Two types here: walking and weight training.



Walking, I do 4 miles 1-2 times a week with the dogs, usually on a weekend and almost always on a fasting day.  Additionally, go for a short 10 minute walk after dinner whenever you can.



I do weight training 3-4 times a week. I never weight lift on a fasting day, but I will always workout fasted (e.g. before the 7:30am meal on an eating day).  I do the typical thing here: leg day, back/bi day, chest/tri day.  My workouts are usually 60 minutes with about 15 of that reserved for warmups before and stretching after.  I found time for this by getting up at 5am, 90 minutes earlier than normal.  Only thing I could make work.


**MEDICAL TESTS**

In addition to losing the weight, I did hydro static testing.  Only 15 pounds was lean mass loss, and I even think that’s high since my baseline tests were after eating, and my follow ups were fasted.  The guy running the test says this ratio is slightly better than he usually sees for fat loss.  He sees 25% lean reduction where I’m only 20% (and again I think that’s inflated by at least 5 pounds because of how I ate before the first test).

My triglycerides are down 40%, my cholesterol dropped to 160 with my HDL increasing, cardiac inflammation markers down 50%, and kidney/liver/gallbladder function improved.  Liver fat isn’t an issue anymore (ALT went from 55 to 20) and my A1C went from 5.7 to 5.5 as of 4 months ago (retesting next week).


**MAINTENANCE**

Not sure what’s gonna work for me for maintenance, so what I’m planning is to drop to a single 36 hour fast per week (turning it into a 60 3-4 times a year), introduce berries and possibly sweet potatoes into my diet, and then change nothing else.


**NOTE ON ALCOHOL**

I mostly quit drinking.  I don’t think there’s a way really make it work.  Theoretically your body can process up to a drink a day without causing harm, but that will occupy your liver from doing other work for your body.  Since I’ve started a year ago I’ve drank maybe 8 times, and when I do I’ve maxed out at 2 drinks, but was mainly just one drink.  Non-alcoholic beer tastes good nowadays and seems pretty socially acceptable, so you can always nurse one of those on occasion (though they have carbs).",1,1737662817.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

What’s on the Other Side Followed Me Home. (Part 1),"The moving truck pulled away, leaving behind a faint haze of exhaust in the cool autumn air. Amara stood on the porch, her arms folded against the chill, watching it go. I caught her eye and nodded to the box in my arms. “Last one,” I said, forcing a grin.

She returned a tired smile. “*Finally*. I thought this day would never end.”

Our new house sat on a quiet cul-de-sac, its peeling white paint and sagging porch giving it the charm of a fixer-upper, though neither of us had the money or the skills to fix much of anything. But it was *ours*, and more importantly, it was far away from everything we’d left behind.

I dropped the box onto the floor of the living room, a space that smelled faintly of mildew and decades of stale cigarette smoke. Sunlight streamed through grimy windows, illuminating the uneven hardwood floors and an old radiator that gurgled every few minutes, as though testing its own existence. Amara followed me in, her gaze sweeping the room.

“Well,” she said, trying to sound optimistic, “it’s...got *character*.”

“It’s perfect,” I replied. “A little scrubbing, a little paint, and this place will feel like home.”

*Home*. The word felt foreign. For months, we’d been drifting, scraping together enough cash for security deposits and ignoring the calls from our parents. My parents had made it clear they’d cut me off the moment I moved in with Amara. Her family’s response had been harsher: threatening voicemails, harassing letters, even the occasional uninvited “visit” from their church members.

Now, standing here, hundreds of miles away from their disapproval, I felt a tentative sense of peace. The house was far from ideal, but it was *ours*. A clean slate.

Amara crossed the room and stood beside me, her arm brushing mine. “It’s strange,” she said. “When I first saw the photos online, I didn’t think much of it, but now... I don’t know. Something about this place feels peculiar. And not in a charming way.”

I glanced at her. “It’s just empty. Once we get our stuff unpacked, it’ll feel better. You’ll see.”

She nodded, though the furrow in her brow didn’t relax.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

The first few days passed in a blur of unpacking and cleaning. The house wasted little time revealing its quirks: a toilet that hissed when it flushed, a draft that seemed to come from nowhere, and faint creaks that traveled the halls at night. I wrote them off as typical old-house sounds, but Amara wasn’t convinced.

On our third night, we sat on the porch, watching the last hints of daylight fade into a bruised purple sky. The street was eerily quiet, the only movement coming from a lone cat that slunk across the yard.

“I don’t think anyone else lives on this street,” Amara said. “Have you seen a single car? A light on in any of the other houses?”

I hadn’t, but I shrugged. “It’s probably just an old neighborhood. Maybe everyone’s gone to bed early.”

“Maybe,” she said, but her voice was tight.

The following weekend, we met Walter and Elaine. They lived a few streets over and had stopped by with a plate of cookies and a practiced friendliness that only slightly masked their curiosity.

“We’ve been here thirty-five years,” Walter said, his gravelly voice carrying over the clink of coffee cups. “Seen plenty of folks come and go. But it’s been a while since anyone stuck around as long as you two have.”

I exchanged a glance with Amara. “What do you mean?”

Walter leaned back, swirling his coffee. “Well, the last owners left in a hurry. Before them, there was Roger. Lived here alone, kept to himself mostly. One day, just up and vanished. Car still in the driveway. No sign of foul play. Just... *gone*.”

“Walter,” Elaine interjected, giving him a sharp look. “Don’t scare them off. It’s a lovely house. I’m sure you’ll be happy here.”

Walter raised his hands in mock surrender. “Just telling the truth.”

Later that evening, after the neighbors left, Amara sat cross-legged on the living room floor, a troubled look on her face.

“Do you think it’s true?” she asked. “What Walter said?”

“I don’t know,” I replied honestly. “But people leave for all sorts of reasons. Maybe he just wanted to start over.”

“Like us,” she said softly.

“Exactly.” I reached for her hand. “This is our fresh start. Let’s not overthink it.”

She nodded, but I could tell Walter’s story had unsettled her. Truthfully, it had unsettled me too.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

The rain came down in soft sheets as we pulled into the neighbors' driveway the following Friday evening. Their house was a cozy split-level with warm light spilling from its windows, a stark contrast to the chill of the gray drizzle outside. Elaine greeted us at the door with her usual cheerful demeanor, though her smile seemed more subdued than before.

“Come in, come in!” she said, ushering us inside. “Walter’s already pouring the wine.”

The dining room was modest but inviting, the air filled with the scent of roast chicken and rosemary. Walter sat at the head of the table, a glass of cabernet in hand, his gruff features softened by the flicker of candlelight.

“Good to see you two,” he said with a nod as we sat down. “We were just talking about how rare it is to have new neighbors in these parts. Doesn’t happen often.”

Elaine gave him a pointed look but said nothing as she served the chicken. Conversation meandered through small talk—Walter’s retirement from the local post office, Elaine’s baking hobby, and our plans for the property. Despite the casual tone, I noticed Walter’s gaze linger on me a beat too long whenever the the subject of the house came up.

“So,” Walter said after a while, leaning back in his chair. “How’re you settling in? New home treating you well?”

I hesitated, glancing at Amara. “It’s been fine so far. A few quirks, but nothing major.”

He chuckled, the sound low and dry, feigning amusement. “Quirks, huh? That’s *one* way to put it.”

“Walter!” Elaine warned softly, her smile fixed but strained.

“What?” he said, raising his hands innocently. “They ought to know!”

“Know *what*?” Amara asked, her tone sharper than I’d ever heard it. I shot her a look, but Walter was already speaking.

“Look, it’s an old house,” he said. “Houses like that... they’ve got stories. *Histories*. Some good, some bad. Take Roger, for instance.”

“Walter, don’t—” Elaine started, but he waved her off.

“They should know,” he repeated. Turning to us, he added, “Roger was the guy who lived there before the couple you bought the place from. Kept to himself. Quiet. But then one day, *poof*. Gone. Car in the driveway, wallet on the counter. No note, no nothing.”

A chill ran down my spine. “Right. You mentioned that the other day. What happened to him?”

Walter shrugged, taking a long sip of wine. “Your guess is as good as mine. Cops couldn’t make sense of it either. They looked for weeks but came up with nothing. Like he just... stopped existing.”

Amara’s hand slipped into mine under the table, her grip tight.

“Walter’s exaggerating,” Elaine said quickly, her voice high and tense. “Roger was... well, he wasn’t exactly the most stable person. People like that sometimes just... *leave*. It’s a big world.”

I wanted to believe her, but the unease in her voice betrayed her attempt at reassurance.

On the way home, the rain had stopped, leaving the streets slick and gleaming under the streetlights. Amara was silent, staring out the window, her arms crossed tightly.

“You okay?” I asked.

She turned to me, her expression grim. “Do you think it’s true? What Walter said?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “But it doesn’t really matter, does it? I mean, people disappear for all kinds of reasons.”

“Do they?” she countered, her voice rising. “Because that doesn’t sound like someone who just wanted a change of scenery. He left *everything* behind, Sean. Who does that?”

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

The next day, curiosity got the better of me. While Amara was at work, I drove to the local library to do a little digging. The librarian, a kind woman in her sixties, directed me to the archive section, where I spent hours sifting through old newspapers and records.

What I found only deepened the mystery.

Five years ago, Roger's disappearance had made the front page of the local paper. The article described him as a reclusive man who worked as an accountant and rarely socialized. Neighbors reported hearing strange noises coming from his house in the weeks before he vanished—low thuds, murmurs, and the occasional distant scream.

One neighbor was quoted saying, “It was like the house was alive. Sometimes I’d hear it groan, like it was settling, but not quite.”

I closed the file, a knot tightening in my stomach.

That evening, I told Amara what I’d found. She listened intently, her face pale.

“We need to leave,” she said the moment I finished.

“Amara, come on,” I said, trying to keep my voice calm. “We can’t just up and leave. We’ve sunk everything into this place.”

“And what if we’re next?” she shot back, her eyes wide with fear. “What if whatever happened to him happens to *us*?”

I didn’t have an answer. Instead, I reached for her hand. “Look, let’s not jump to conclusions. If anything weird happens—*really* weird—we’ll figure it out. *Together*. I promise.”

She didn’t look convinced, but nodded anyway. “Okay. But if it gets worse, we’re leaving. No questions.”

“Deal,” I said, though I got the feeling I was making a promise I might not be able to keep.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

I was digging through the bedroom closet when I saw it for the first time. The light from the overhead bulb flickered weakly as I sorted through a pile of clothing, trying to find the dress shirt Amara swore was in there. I moved a hanger aside and froze.

There, at the back of the closet, was a small, pale blue door.

It was no taller than four feet, with peeling paint revealing dark, rotting wood beneath. The edges were uneven, as though it had been carved by an unsteady hand. It didn’t belong—not in a closet we’d been using for weeks. My eyes traced the lines of its warped frame, and a faint hum seemed to fill the air around me.

“Amara!” I shouted. My voice cracked, louder than I intended. “Baby, come here!”

I heard her footsteps before she appeared in the doorway. She had her hair tied back in a loose bun and a towel slung over her shoulder, mid-laundry. “What’s wrong?” she asked, then saw the look on my face. Her gaze followed mine to the back of the closet.

“What the hell is that?” she whispered, stepping closer.

“I don’t know,” I said. “It wasn’t here before.”

She crouched down, her hand brushing against the floor as she stared at it. “Sean, we’ve lived here for *weeks*. We’ve used this closet every day. How could we miss this?”

I shook my head, unable to answer. “It’s got to lead somewhere. Maybe to storage?” My voice sounded weak, even to me.

Amara stood, arms crossed tightly. “We should call someone. The realtor, maybe.”

I crouched down and reached for the small, rusted doorknob. It felt cold under my fingers. “Let’s just take a look first,” I said, though my stomach churned with unease.

“Sean—”

“Just one look,” I insisted. I turned the knob and pushed.

The door swung open silently, its hinges unnervingly smooth. Beyond it was a dimly lit room, no larger than a child’s bedroom. A single bulb hung from the ceiling, casting a sickly, yellowish glow. The walls were bare, unpainted gray concrete, and the air felt thick. The space was utterly empty.

“It’s just a storage room,” I muttered, though the words felt hollow.

Amara peered over my shoulder, her expression etched with concern. “It doesn’t make sense,” she said. “There’s no way this was here before. I *know* it wasn’t.”

Neither of us moved to step inside. The space felt *wrong*—too still, too suffocating. Finally, I pulled the door shut and stood, wiping my hands on my jeans.

“Maybe it’s some old crawlspace they never sealed off,” I said, trying to sound nonchalant. “We’ll figure it out.”

Amara didn’t answer. She just stared at the door, her jaw tight.

For the next week, we avoided the closet as much as possible. I’d open it occasionally to confirm that the door was still there, but each time, I felt my stomach clench. Amara stopped using the closet altogether, shoving her clothes into an overstuffed dresser instead.

One night, as I lay in bed, I felt her shift beside me. “I don’t like it,” she said softly. “It’s not normal, Sean.”

“It’s just a door,” I said, though I didn’t believe my own words. “We’ll seal it off if it bothers you that much.”

Her fingers found mine under the blanket, squeezing lightly. “I’m scared it’s not just a door.”

Two days later, I found out she was right.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

It was late afternoon, and Amara was at work. I’d taken a day off to catch up on repairs around the house, though I’d spent most of the morning avoiding anything remotely productive. By the time I got to the closet, I was in a mood to prove something—to the house, to myself, I wasn’t sure.

I opened the door, expecting the same empty room as before. But what greeted me was far from vacant.

The space was... *different*. The gray walls were gone, replaced by dark, wooden panels that gleamed faintly under the dim light of a single candle resting on a desk in the center of the room. Bookshelves lined the walls, crammed with old, leather-bound volumes whose spines gleamed gold and black. A staircase spiraled upward at the far end, its narrow steps disappearing into shadows.

I stepped back, slamming the door shut. It shouldn’t have been possible. I stood there for what felt like an eternity, staring at the now-closed door.

When Amara came home, I was still sitting on the edge of the bed, my hands clasped tightly in my lap.

“Sean?” she asked cautiously, dropping her bag by the door. “What’s wrong?”

I didn’t answer right away. Instead, I gestured toward the closet. “You have to see this.”

She didn’t argue. I think she already knew. Together, we walked to the closet, her hand gripping mine tightly. When I opened it, we both froze.

Both the door and the room were gone. There was no desk, no bookshelves, no staircase. Just a smooth beige wall where the pale blue door had been.

That night, the door appeared again—this time in the hallway, embedded in the wall as though it had *always* been there. Its faded blue paint and cracked edges seemed to mock us, daring us to look again.

I opened it without thinking. Amara protested, but her voice sounded muffled and distant. The room had changed yet again. This time, the door opened onto a narrow corridor that stretched far beyond what could logically fit within the house. My jaw dropped.

“Sean,” Amara whispered, her voice trembling. “Please stop.”

I closed the door, my hand shaking as I latched it shut. I couldn’t look at her, couldn’t face the fear in her eyes.

Swallowing hard, I backed away, and avoided the room for the rest of the night.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

It appeared again three days later, this time in the living room. The pale blue door stood against the far wall, framed by flickering shadows from the late afternoon sun streaming through the curtains. The sight of it made my stomach turn, though I wasn’t sure if it was fear or something worse—*curiosity*.

“Sean, *don’t*,” Amara said, her voice sharp as I approached it. She stood by the kitchen counter, arms crossed, tapping her foot nervously. “It’s just going to get worse.”

I turned to her, hand hovering over the doorknob. “What do you think it’s going to do? Hurt us? It’s just a door.”

Her jaw tightened. “That’s not all it is, and you know it.”

She was right, of course. I *did* know. But knowing wasn’t enough to stop me. Not anymore. Slowly, I gripped the knob, half expecting it to be hot to the touch. It wasn’t. Instead, it felt unnervingly cool, like touching tools left in the shade. With a deep breath, I turned it and pushed.

This time, the door opened into a sprawling study. This room was larger than the house itself, its walls lined with bookshelves that stretched infinitely into the darkness. The scent of old paper and something faintly metallic permeated the air. In the center, there was a single wooden desk, its surface cluttered with scattered pages. Atop it, a brass holder held a single unlit candle.

“This isn’t real,” Amara whispered from behind me, her voice trembling. “It *can’t* be real.”

I didn’t reply.

My feet moved before I could stop them, crossing the threshold and stepping into the room. The wooden floor creaked beneath me, the sound echoing unnaturally, as though the space was even larger than it appeared.

The books on the shelves were aged—some with cracked leather bindings, others bound in materials I didn’t recognize. Many of their spines were engraved with titles in languages I couldn’t read, though a few were familiar. I pulled one off the shelf, the name catching my eye: *The Return of the King.*

I opened it, flipping to the end. The text was familiar at first, describing Frodo and Sam’s journey through Mount Doom. But as I read on, the more I realized something was *off*. In this version, Frodo faltered at the last moment, and the Ring slipped from his grasp—straight into Sauron’s hand. Middle-earth plunged into darkness, the world crumbling under his reign.

I slammed the book shut and turned to Amara, who had hesitated at first but eventually followed me into the room, her curiosity finally outweighing her worry. She stood beside me, thumbing through another volume. “The ending,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “It’s *wrong*.”

She looked up, her brow furrowed. “What do you mean, Sean?”

I held up the book. “It’s like it’s been rewritten. *Twisted*. Look at this.” I handed it to her, watching as her face grew paler with each word.

“This is insane,” she said, shaking her head.

She dropped the book onto the desk as if it burned her, then grabbed another from the shelf: *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.* Her fingers flipped through the pages, and I saw her face twist with discomfort as she read. “Alice doesn’t go home,” she said finally. “She gets stuck in Wonderland. *Forever*. And it’s not whimsical anymore. It’s... *cruel*.”

We kept reading, unable to stop despite the growing dread. *To Kill a Mockingbird* ended with Atticus ostracized, Scout left alone in a town that succumbed entirely to hatred. In *The Great Gatsby*, Nick never leaves Long Island, instead becoming a hollow shell of himself as he inherits Gatsby’s empty ambitions. Each story was familiar yet warped, like reflections in broken glass.

“These aren’t just wrong,” Amara said, her voice trembling. “They’re... *worse*. Like they’re designed to take hope away.”

\* \* \* \* \* \*

We left the study with a handful of books, hoping to find answers. The local bookstore owner, Mrs. Wells, listened patiently as we explained. She examined the books with skeptical eyes, running her fingers over the bindings and flipping through the pages.

“They’re interesting,” she said slowly. “But these are just stories. Maybe some kind of bootleg copies or fan rewrites. I’ve seen people do that before.”

“These aren’t rewrites,” I insisted. “They’re... wrong. And they were in our house. Through a door that shouldn’t exist.”

Susan gave me a look—the look of someone deciding whether or not they were talking to a lunatic. “Well,” she said after a pause, handing the books back to me, “I’d keep them for the novelty, at least. They’re fascinating, if nothing else.”

We left the store feeling more isolated than ever. On the drive home, Amara stared out the window, her fingers gripping her seatbelt tightly.

“What if it’s trying to show us something?” she said suddenly.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“The door. The books. What if it’s not just random? What if it’s *leading* us somewhere?”

The idea chilled me. “Leading us *where*?”

She shrugged.

That night, the temperature in the house plummeted, making sleep difficult. Down the hall, in the living room, the books sat on the coffee table, untouched. I couldn’t bring myself to open them again, but I couldn’t stop thinking about them either.

When I finally managed to get some shut-eye, my dreams were plagued with visions of twisting staircases and endless bookshelves. In them, I wandered through the study alone, until at last I came to the end of the room, where a figure stood with its back to me, unmoving. When I reached out to touch its shoulder, it turned—and I saw my own face staring back at me, hollow-eyed and gaunt.

I woke with a start, shivering and gasping for air. Beside me, Amara lay undisturbed. I did my best to relax and regain my composure; soon enough, my eyes grew heavy, and I drifted off again into a restless slumber. Before I did, however, I peered at Amara once more, and wondered, briefly, if she was dreaming, too.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

The following evening, the door moved again. Amara found it this time, positioned in the hallway beside the coat rack. I heard her call my name, panic thinly veiled under her voice.

“Sean, it’s back.”

I stepped out of the kitchen, drying my hands on a dish towel. She stood a few feet away from the door, arms crossed and shoulders tense. I joined her, the faint chill of the hallway brushing against my skin as I stared at the now familiar, cracked blue wood.

“What do we do?” she asked.

I didn’t answer. Instead, I reached for the knob. The air around it felt colder than the rest of the house, and my fingers trembled slightly as I turned it.

This time, the door opened into something entirely different. A vast room stretched out before us, its domed ceiling curving high above our heads. At its center stood a massive antique telescope, its brass frame gleaming faintly in the dim light filtering through the windows.

The floor beneath our feet was made of cold stone, etched with strange symbols that seemed to shift and writhe if I stared at them too long. Around the room were desks piled with star charts and scattered notes, some of them covered in a language I couldn’t decipher.

“This...” Amara’s voice trailed off as she stepped through the door. “This doesn’t make any sense.”

The air seemed thicker inside, our every movement met with resistance. With great effort I approached the telescope, the faint hum of its mechanisms sending vibrations through the floor. When I looked through the lens, I gasped.

The sky it revealed was unlike anything I’d ever seen. Constellations of jagged, unfamiliar stars hung suspended in a black void, their light cold and pale. In the distance, something massive and black pulsed faintly, its surface devouring the light around it. Nearby, a shattered planet spun slowly, its glowing molten core exposed like a raw wound.

“Amara,” I whispered, stepping back. “You need to see this.”

She hesitated before approaching, her hand gripping my arm as she leaned down to peer through the lens. I watched her face shift from curiosity to shock. “This... this isn’t our sky,” she said, her voice barely audible. “Sean, what are we looking at?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted, stepping back toward one of the desks. The scattered notes were covered in intricate sketches of the same stars and planets we’d just seen. Some of the papers contained frantic, scrawled warnings: *“Do not look too long.”* *“The black star sees you.”*

I turned to Amara, who was pacing now, her hands pressed to her temples. “We shouldn’t be here,” she said, her voice cracking. “Whatever this place is, it’s not meant for us.”

I wanted to agree with her, but something about the telescope called to me. It wasn’t just curiosity—it was *compulsion*, an invisible thread drawing me toward the lens.

The longer we stayed, the stronger its influence became. The thrum of the telescope grew louder; below, the symbols on the floor glowed faintly, their shifting patterns more pronounced now. My skin crawled with the sensation of being watched.

And then, I saw it.

It wasn’t through the telescope, but in the corner of my vision—something vast and dark moving beyond the windows. I turned quickly, but there was nothing there. Just the faint glimmer of alien constellations.

“Did you see that?” I asked, my voice unsteady.

Amara shook her head, her arms wrapped tightly around herself. “See what?”

“I thought I saw something... outside.”

“There’s nothing out there,” she said, though her voice wavered. “Sean, we need to leave. *Now*.”

As we made our way back to the door, I felt an inexplicable heaviness settle over me, as though the room itself was reluctant to let us go. The air grew frigid, and the hum of the telescope seemed to follow us, vibrating through the walls and into my bones.

We stepped through the doorway and slammed it shut behind us. For a long moment, neither of us spoke. The hallway was silent, the pale blue door standing innocuously in its frame.

Amara turned to me, her face ashen. “We can’t keep doing this,” she said. “It’s not just a door, Sean. It’s... *dangerous*.”

I nodded, though the words felt hollow. The images from the telescope burned in my mind—the black star, the shattered planet, the movement beyond the windows. Whatever the door was, it wasn’t finished with us yet. And deep down, I wasn’t sure if I wanted it to be.

That night, insomnia set in. Unable to sleep, I sketched the constellations we’d seen, my hand moving almost of its own accord. Each star and planet came to life on the page, jagged lines and stark contrasts capturing the alien beauty of what we’d witnessed.

When Amara found me in the morning, the sketches covered the kitchen table. She stared at them for a long time, her expression unreadable.

“Sean,” she said finally, her voice soft but firm. “You’re not yourself.”

“I’m fine,” I lied.

“No,” she said, shaking her head. “You’re not. This... *thing*, this door, it’s changing you. And I won’t let it take you. Please, Sean, I can’t lose you. Not like this. Not now.”

Her words cut through me, but I had nothing to say. Instead, I gathered the sketches and stuffed them into a drawer, hiding them from view, but not from my mind.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The pale blue door appeared again two nights later.

It materialized in the bathroom, refusing to be ignored. After brushing my teeth, I turned to grab a towel, and there it was, its wood ever more warped, its paint cracking audibly, as if straining against the boundaries of reality itself. This time, in its most vile intrusion yet, it had embedded itself in the shower wall, where the tiles should have been.

“Amara,” I called, my voice tight. “It’s back.”

Her footsteps echoed in the hallway before she appeared in the doorway. Her eyes went straight to the door, and I saw her flinch. She knew what I was thinking before I’d spoken a word.

“Sean, don’t,” she whispered. “Please. Don’t open the door.”

I wanted to listen to her. I wanted to pull her out of the bathroom, lock the door behind us, and pretend it didn’t exist. But the door had other ideas. With each passing moment I felt it pulling at me ever more incessantly, tugging at the edge of my thoughts, urging me closer.

“We need to see what’s inside,” I said, though the words felt like they belonged to someone else. “If we keep running from it, it’ll never stop.”

“Please, Sean, no,” Amara said, shaking her head. “It’s not going to stop anyway. Opening it just makes it worse. Please, leave it alone.”

Her words hung in the air. For a moment, I considered what she’d said. But then my hand moved, almost of its own accord, reaching for the doorknob as it had so many times before. It felt cold, almost wet, under my fingers—and unsettlingly familiar.

“Sean, no!” Amara shouted, sobbing in protest. But it was too late.

The door swung open.

The hallway beyond was narrow and dimly lit, the walls lined with mirrors that stretched from floor to ceiling. Their surfaces gleamed faintly, reflecting the pale light from somewhere far ahead. The air smelled faintly of mildew, and the floor beneath our feet was cold and damp,

Amara grabbed my arm, her nails digging into my skin. “We shouldn’t be here,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Let’s just go back.”

I nodded, but my feet carried me forward anyway. The mirrors were pristine at first, reflecting us as we crept through the hallway. But as we moved deeper, the reflections began to shift.

In one mirror, my reflection lagged behind me, its movements delayed as though it were struggling to keep up. In another, Amara’s reflection glanced over its shoulder, its eyes wide with fear. I reached out to touch one of the mirrors, but Amara grabbed my wrist.

“Don’t!” she cried. “What if it... what if it traps you?”

“Relax,” I said, lowering my hand. “It’s just glass.” Even as the words left my mouth, I wasn’t sure I believed them.

We kept moving, the hallway growing colder with each step. The mirrors became more distorted, their surfaces warping and twisting as though alive. One showed me as a child, standing alone in a dark room I didn’t recognize. Another showed Amara, but her face was cadaverous, her eyes sunken and hollow.

“Sean,” she said suddenly, stopping in her tracks. “Look at this one. We’re not in it.”

I turned to see what she meant. The mirror beside her reflected only the hallway—no me, no Amara, just an empty stretch of stone and glass. A chill ran down my spine, and I pulled her closer.

“Let’s keep going,” I said. “We’re almost through.”

I didn’t believe that either.

At the far end of the hallway, a single mirror stood cracked and jagged. As we approached, I heard a faint, muffled voice coming from the other side.

I froze. “Do you hear that?”

Amara nodded. “It’s... it’s *you*.”

The voice grew louder as we got closer, and I realized she was right. It *was* my voice, though it was distorted, broken by static and echo. I stepped forward, staring into the broken glass.

My reflection stared back at me, its face twisted in anguish. It pressed its hands against the glass, its mouth moving in silent desperation. And then the sound came through, faint but unmistakable.

“Help me,” it said, its voice a choked whisper. “You’ve got to help me.”

“Sean,” Amara said, her voice trembling. “We need to leave.”

But I couldn’t move. My reflection’s eyes locked onto mine, and I felt a strange pull, like it was dragging me into the glass. I raised my hand, my fingers trembling as they hovered inches from the surface.

“Don’t!” Amara grabbed my arm, pulling me back. The moment she touched me, the mirror shifted. My reflection smiled, its mouth curling into a cruel grin. Behind it, the hallway began to buckle and collapse, the glass warping and splintering as darkness bled in from the edges.

“Run!” I shouted, grabbing her hand.

We sprinted back the way we came, the mirrors shattering around us. The sound was deafening, a cacophony of exploding glass and echoing laughter. The hallway grew darker with each step, the faint light from the door ahead sputtering like a dying flame.

The ground beneath us shifted, becoming slippery and uneven. Amara stumbled, and I caught her just as a shard of glass fell from above, shattering inches from her feet.

“Keep going!” I shouted, pulling her forward. The door was just ahead, its frame glowing faintly in the encroaching darkness.

We burst through it together, slamming it shut behind us. For a moment, we stood there, gasping for air, our hands still clasped tightly. The bathroom was silent, the pale blue door standing innocently in the shower wall as though nothing had happened.

Amara turned to me, her eyes filled with tears. “Sean,” she said, her voice breaking. “We can’t keep doing this. It’s going to [kill ](https://www.creepypastastories.com/authors/craig-groshek)[us.”](https://www.youtube.com/user/chillingtaleswi)",1,1737662729.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I went to my car around 5:30am this morning and both the driver side and passenger side windows were smashed. Doesn’t look like they tried to break in or the glass would have been more scattered. No other nearby cars looked affected. And the person would have had to punch one window and walk around to the other side to get the other. Gives me the impression it wasn’t just some aggro rando walking inbetween the cars and happened to punch one window on the way. 

Who did i piss off recently lol? I did get scolded by a woman walking her dogs this week for going 19 in a 25 mph zone on 1st street between falcon and Esperanza at like 730am. My bad! I am
sorry and I slowed down. People walking dogs in this neighborhood though, please be mindful of the leash length. Sometimes when driving you don’t see the dog because the leash is extended so long away from the owner and the dog is in the street, low to the ground and the owner is so far behind, it’s easy to not realize the dog is there crossing the street or poking out into the street on their own. Keep those babes on a closer hold peeps. Going off on a tangent. I digress. 

Anyway! 
If anyone on e 2nd between falcon and Esperanza have outdoor cameras facing the street, please let me know and I’ll buy you a coffee or drink! The situation could always be worse but this really threw off work my day and will set me back $500.",1,1737662719.0,u_Agitated-Welcome1372,0,1.0,False

Hi there! I’m Danny, a 30-year-old marketing professional who’s equal parts creative, curious, and driven. I’m here looking for someone special to share life’s little joys, big adventures, and everything in between. If you enjoy witty banter, meaningful conversations, and laughing until your cheeks hurt, we might just click.

What It’s Like Dating Me
	•	The Fun Factor: Whether it’s spontaneous day trips, movie marathons, or a hilariously intense board game night, I’ll keep life interesting.
	•	Master of Chill Plans: Cozy evenings with good food and even better company are my specialty.
	•	Storytime Pro: My life has been full of amusing, absurd, and downright ridiculous moments—I can’t wait to share them.
	•	Life’s Little Perks: Whether it’s discovering hidden gems, unexpected surprises, or just knowing the best restaurants, being with me means life feels a bit brighter.
	•	Your Steady Companion: I’m calm under pressure, dependable, and will always have your back (or your favorite snack).

A Bit About Me
I’m a blend of creativity and curiosity, with a knack for finding beauty in the ordinary. I’m happiest when I’m exploring a new city, diving into an engrossing book, or losing track of time in a great conversation.

Travel is a huge part of my life—I’ve visited Canada, the USA, Colombia, the Bahamas, and Mexico, and my wanderlust isn’t slowing down. Bonus: I speak Spanish, so we can plan trips to some incredible destinations!

When I’m not traveling, I’m immersing myself in art, music, and storytelling. Whether it’s swapping favorite songs, checking out an art gallery, or discussing life’s big questions over coffee, I’m all about connecting on a deeper level.

What I’m Looking For
I’m open to connecting with women from all walks of life—what matters most is that we bring out the best in each other. Here’s what I value:
	•	Laughter and Fun: A great sense of humor and a willingness to laugh at life’s quirks.
	•	Kind and Open-Minded: Someone who’s genuine, grounded, and ready to embrace new experiences.
	•	Emotionally Intelligent: Communication, empathy, and loyalty are the foundation of meaningful connections.
	•	A Little Playful: Life’s too short to take too seriously—let’s have some fun!

Why You Should Message Me
If you’re looking for someone who sees life as an adventure, values deep connections, and brings positivity to every moment, I might just be your guy. I’ll keep you laughing, surprise you with thoughtful gestures, and make even the mundane feel special.

Whether we’re discovering a new favorite spot, enjoying a lazy Sunday morning, or plotting a spontaneous getaway, I’m all in for making memories together.

Let’s Make Memories
I believe the best relationships are built on shared experiences, meaningful conversations, and a lot of laughter. Whether it’s exploring quirky art exhibits, hitting the road for a last-minute trip, or cozying up for a movie night, I’m looking for someone who’s as excited about the journey as I am.

Final Thoughts
Distance doesn’t scare me if we vibe—it’s all about building something meaningful. If you’re in your twenties or beyond, adventurous, grounded, and ready for something real, let’s chat. Tell me your favorite story, dream destination, or the last thing that made you laugh—I’d love to hear it.

Life’s too short for “what ifs”—let’s start something amazing.

1i8ce8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/molecularbiology/comments/1i8ce8k/struggling_to_find_work_open_to_suggestions/,Struggling to Find Work - Open to Suggestions,"Hey all! 

I graduated last year with a Master of Science in Pathobiology. Before that, I earned an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and conducted over two years of post-baccalaureate research at the NIH. In total, I have 5+ years of molecular research experience, along with lecture and lab teaching experience. Throughout my research career, I gained expertise in a variety of molecular techniques and specialized in flow cytometry.

About two months before I graduated, I began my job search. I applied to over 100 positions for which I was qualified and/or overqualified, along with a few “dream job” applications where I was slightly underqualified but still felt within a reasonable grasp. Out of those 100+ applications, I received about five interviews. For one of those opportunities, I advanced to the final stage of a two-month application process, only to be rejected after the final round of interviews.

From what I can tell, my CV is strong, and I’ve tried nearly everything I can think of. I’ve reached out to recruiters and principal investigators (PIs) directly, created customized cover letters for every position, and even offered to meet with prospective employers for coffee to discuss their research. Despite these efforts, I keep coming up short.

After about four months of job searching, I needed to work and ended up taking a position in an unrelated field—food service. I was quickly promoted to a corporate role, which has provided financial stability for the time being. However, I’m incredibly discouraged, as my passion lies in working within the biological sciences. While I’ve been able to apply some of my research background to my current position (e.g., assisting with the acquisition of FDA licensure for my company), I feel lost when it comes to re-entering the field. I want to either elevate or make a lateral salary transition, but I’ve now been out of the biomedical field for over a year, and I worry that the longer this continues, the harder it will be to merge back in.

**My questions for everyone out there are:**

1. Are others experiencing similar struggles finding employment in their field of research?
2. Are there pathways I might be missing to re-enter the field? Recently, I’ve been applying to Field Application Scientist positions through Thermo Fisher, but despite tailoring my CV and cover letters and reaching out to recruiters, I feel like I’m getting nowhere.
3. What methods have you used to make connections outside of academia that have helped open doors?

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I look forward to hearing your stories and advice. While I haven’t given up hope on finding a good career path, this year-long search is definitely starting to take a toll on me.",1,1737662282.0,molecularbiology,0,1.0,False

My heart pounds harder and I think faster too for a few seconds at a time. It happens randomly, well most of the time at least. I noticed today that it happens when I bend over or get up, or even take a deep breath sometimes, other times they're just random and happen while I'm not doing anything. I could go 2h without getting one and then get several ones in 2min. 

For context, I'm 19, I don't drink coffee nor alcohol. I don't feel particularly stressed out unless subconsciously so I'm not sure it's caused by stress. 

Some reasons I thought of that could cause them are my lack of exercise in the past month. From mid December to this Monday I was on winter break. December exams messed me up so bad I was basically rotting the entire break.
Classes started again this Monday and I do a 2h commute and walk a lot, plus my college has hills and weird paths and whatnot so I thought it might be the lifestyle change with no transition. I've also slept terribly this past week so probably that too. To top it all off, it's the week before my period so I wouldn't be surprised if this is what's causing them. 

I started taking magnesium and vitamin D today so I'm hoping they go away once these starts having longer term effects or once I get my period. 
But in the meantime they're so disturbing even though it says everywhere that it's not a source of concern if not accompanied by any other symptoms. I didn't worry much yesterday and this morning. But I've had them at least 40 times today from 6am to 9pm and it's kinda scaring me cuz I don't know how frequently people who experienced them had them.",2,1737662223.0,Heartpalpitations,0,1.0,False

Having lots of relationship history with intimacy. Personally I don't have ANY intimacy experience on purpose and I don't want someone with LOTS of experience/relationship history. Also if you broke up recently that's also a big no for me. No one is an aid band duh.

I'm 6.1 - 185cm muscular build, (not too shredded) wide shoulders, white skin, black hair, eyes and beard ( I don't like having a long beard so I keep it short or shave ) . You can see me from the link below.

I'm from Turkey and my ethnicity is Caucasian.

My personality type is INFP-A , I don't believe horoscopes or to any religion.

I'm a Concept/2D Artist. I draw character designs, potraits, any stuff I like.

I'm loyal, empathetic, protective, dependable and love to share every thought I have with my partner and also expect the same thing.

I love melancholy in general, I have couple of sad song playlists on Spotify.

My main hobbies are drawing, powerlifting and gaming. I also do some other stuff like playing electric guitar sometimes but who cares.

I like getting and giving attention in equal terms.

I'm also an open book, I don't hide anything.

Also, I do care about physical attraction, I'm adding my photos first so you don't have to send a message if you don't find me attractive enough. In the end everyone has a different taste.

Now I'm wondering if I will even meet someone that shares the same principles and values as me.","I know that I'm still young, and I truly believe that love is out there but honestly, with my experiences with it, I feel like I am not so sure anymore. I didn't really date anyone during school or college (during my diploma) as I was too busy grinding for good grades.  I wanted to pursue my passion of becoming a chef, so I focused on that. Ended up being successful both academically and career wise as I had the chance to work with multiple great chefs in multiple different establishments and now at one of the best restaurants in my city. However, I kind of realized I somewhat screwed up as I didn't have the chance to meet my partner during those times, and had to resort to using dating apps, which unfortunately were awful (bad dates, ghosting, people only wanting to hook up with me for my looks). I got incredibly lonely till I met my first ex unexpectedly, it was love at first sight and we loved each other, I gave her everything, took care of her and met all her needs, however she had her own grocery list of mental health issues and over two years, she tormented me mentally by constant abuse, blaming it on her depression and bipolar, I was calm and patient with her despite her constantly breaking up and coming back to me.  Her using TikTok or her psychology studies as reasoning to breakup with me, or saying she wants her 'freedom era' or 'situationship' or 'no label relationship'. I got anxious since we both met each other's parents, and my parents were initially happy with her as my partner. One day, she threw away and burnt all my things I gave her and posted it publicly, as well as cheated on me, then bragging about it to me, only for her the next same week to apologize and blame it on her mental health issues and 'emotions'. After that all i got was a 'sorry' and then I was blocked to oblivion. It was harsh but I accepted it for what it was.

That was, a year ago, I have since moved on and done a lot of things such as focusing on my passion, faith, career as well as disciplining myself to workout daily, in addition to taking care of my family and pets. I finally finished my two degrees and have received my first promotion at work. I was starting to see people and going on dates again, however I realized that most of these people only wanted situationships or hooking up, which still frustrates me. The actual times I do meet someone that wants a relationship, I get initially love bombed and then I get ghosted and blocked or saying they are afraid of 'commitment', and that they want all the benefits of a relationship without actually being in one. Honestly, its kind of disappointing and quite sad and I'm starting to wonder if It is too late to find the right person that still wants to date to marry in this era. I'm focusing on myself now, but sometimes I feel quite left out and lonely when I see all my friends, classmates and family members around my age in long term happy relationships, with most getting engaged soon, meanwhile I'm still trying to pick up the pieces and figuring out if I still have the chance for love in this lifetime. I just wanted someone that can accept me despite my flaws, for the person I am, a person I can take care off, that will be there for me, to cherish life during both our ups and downs. I miss being able to cook and make coffee for my partner too.

tl;dr , I felt like I focused too much on my career, passion and studies that I didn't had the time to find that someone, while I did met someone, that person whom I thought would love me, left me in broken pieces, While I have moved on and have a lot of self-growth now, focusing on myself as well as going out there and meeting new people, the modern dating landscape makes everything difficult for a hopeless romantic like me that just genuinely wants to date to marry now. Seeing my friends, family and former classmates getting engaged, makes me feel super lonely and failure at love, with me being the last single person in their circle doesn't help also when I'm constantly bombarded with questions of who,why, when, where and what?

\*\*\*

I didn’t like mornings so as a workaround I got up at noon. Today I got up at the crack of dawn, rawdogged a coffee, and took the subway to work. It was my first day, a November-adjacent, rainy, grim, absolute Monday.

I sat at my new desk, in my assigned Halloween costume, drying off, waiting for Kate. Rows of tile ceiling lights lit up the floor, which was filled with cubicles and seemed too quiet, almost deserted, even with the muted tapping of keyboards. It was as soulless as I imagined. I was craving a frosted muffin, Googling the closest Caffrey’s, when the person in the next cubicle launched a Teams meeting, without headphones, with the volume up. Sullen voices muttered greetings. Something called Reporter was down and the month-end close hadn’t run. The dev team screwed up the upgrade, someone kept repeating. The manual workaround couldn’t be applied. They needed a new one, fast. I could relate. 

Kate’s voice rang out from the next pod. Her words dissolved easily into laughter, the way mine did after some glasses of wine. I had never had a manager before, or a real job. Sitting for my mother’s artist friends didn’t count, according to Matt, although I was good at it. They liked my cheekbones, my slight goth look; I liked to let my mind wander. My mother liked that I didn’t make enough to leave her. She didn’t think much of my computer science degree or my Don’t Care Bear stash. But unlike the degree, the weed slowed me down and kept me in the basement, so she let it go. 

Now, according to Matt, I had settled. I didn’t see how. I’d never been anywhere. He said I wouldn’t last the week, that I couldn’t do normal. 

My cubicle was tiny and looked older than me and almost everything was beige. It couldn’t have been more drab, but I had to sit in it for only a few hours each day. How hard could that be. ",1,1737661475.0,justthepubtip,0,1.0,False

It’s knowing that every glance, every small interaction, carries so much weight because she doesn’t even realize how much she means to me.

But it’s not just about her—it’s about me, too. I’m the kind of person who overthinks everything, who replays conversations in my head and wonders if I said too much or not enough. I’m the friend who remembers your coffee order after hearing it once, who will hype you up on your worst day, and who loves harder than I probably should.

I feel everything deeply, and sometimes that’s exhausting, but it’s also what makes me, me. It’s why I fall for the little things that others might overlook. Like how her voice gets softer when she’s serious, or how she unconsciously fidgets when she’s thinking.

I think the most beautiful and terrifying part of all this is wondering : does she see me the way I see her? 
Have you ever had someone take up so much space in your heart without even knowing it?

Living room - right of pulp fiction, 2 smaller wall pieces. Maybe an iron star, horse shoe, small frame. It is renter friendly to use command strips on top of electrical boxes.

Rug, doesn’t have to be large and expensive but at least some color and texture under the coffee table.

Pictures behind couch- change out some of the frames. They’re all give the same print feeling and you can do a lot with just switching up different frame thickness and color. 
And either bring them down closer to the couch or add a behind the couch console table and put plants and a lamp on it 

Curtain right going into bedroom. Separates the space, adds height and texture.

Bedroom- there’s no headboard so a rectangular picture kinda lower, but not too low to the bed would look really nice. 

And a sconce on the smaller wall.

As soon as I start to recover from one illness, I get an onslaught of symptoms again. I don’t know how I’m getting sick because no one around me is sick. They’re all colds which aren’t too bad usually but each subsequent illness has felt worse and worse. I think it’s because my body doesn’t get a chance to fully recover from the last illness before I’m sick again. I work from home and outside of errands a couple times a week and sitting in a coffee shop away from others to read for an hour on Sat & Sun mornings, I don’t go anywhere. 

To add to it, I woke up this morning and the husband hadn’t started the dishwasher (his one daily chore), the kids (teenagers, so def old enough) left dirty dishes in their rooms, and the dishes they did put in the sink weren’t rinsed. The garbages were overflowing and my nose was running like a faucet. It took me a good 1.5-2hrs to clean up after my family before I could sit down on the couch, have breakfast (because the dishes I needed were dirty), and rest. I don’t understand why I’m the only one with an autoimmune disorder and yet, the only one cleaning up after myself.  

With being sick, I work and do my stuff around the house to contribute but haven’t had the energy to do the things I enjoy. So, the last 30 days have just felt like a drag. I finally found a wonderful job that is super supportive of my situation but it’s grant funded and ending, so I’m having to look for a job in the rest of my free time in a field that is being hit hard under the current US administration.

It's a little exhausting and so many of them stop the game for 8 or 10 or 12 seconds. Now that triple Strat is getting more play, it's even worse. Watching a Luna ult then a Lokuna ult followed by DISAPPEAR is great if you need a few minutes to make coffee but murders the pace of the game.

Having some anti-heal options would be lovely. The mechanic is already in the game but, unless I'm blanking, it's only on Dr. Strange and he can only cause the effect on himself. But, hey, at least it's an in-use mechanic.

Here are some terrible ideas on how it could be added to future characters:

**Blade:**

* Experimental Serum Rounds-Blade loads his pistol with a clip of anti-heal rounds. Enemies struck can not be healed for 3 seconds. Like a 12 or 15-second cooldown. Maybe a smidge more.

Green Goblin:

* Gas Bomb-Goblin throws a bomb leaving a cloud of gas for six seconds that heals allies inside and prevents enemies in the radius from healing.

**Ghost Rider:**

* Penance Stare (ultimate)-Give a hard look, causing any enemies caught in the stare to reflect on every time they've instalocked Spider-Man in comp and gone 1 and 12. Wide cone in front of GR. Does no damage but any enemies struck by the ult have all healing they receive converted into damage for six seconds. So an allied Sue nukes you if you stay in her field.

**Morbius:**

* These Hands: Morb activates those sucky things in his palms. For the next 8 seconds, his basic melee attack has Lifesteal and causes 1.5 seconds of anti-heal on an enemy. Anti-heal cannot stack but can be refreshed with each hit.",0,1737660385.0,marvelrivals,5,0.5,False

45 yr old Female non smoker, non drinker. 
Confirmed Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. 

Three years ago I started to get burning on my tongue followed by tongue lesions that would almost take the first layers off my tongue. 
When this first started, I had a vitamin D deficiency. 
I currently take 400,000 IU’s of prescribed  vitamin D each month just to maintain my vitamin D level at 30. 

Each month, my tongue goes through the same pattern of lesions and burning.  
I have eliminated foods, coffee, and been tested for celiac disease and lupus. 
I have tried a steroid rinse and a dental paste, neither have worked. I was described a magic mouthwash today. 

It has been diagnosed by four doctors as four different things, one being a geographical tongue. 
Both my husband and daughter have a geographical time and their symptoms can be 95% managed by watching what they eat. No walnuts, no tomatoes, nothing blackened. 
I’ve read about Covid tongue but I’m asymptomatic and have never tested positive for Covid.  

Does anyone have a geographical tongue that resembles mine or is it even a geographical tongue issue?!?

Writing Prompt","(Content Warning: Severed heads, bones crunching, mooks flying and...cannibalism? Did I read that right? But seriously guys, punches will not be pulled. You have been warned. The prompt will make sense by the end)

The sort of people that called the Downs their home knew better than to glance twice at the odd tableau that was a small mountain of a figure making her way down The Avenue in the dead of night; a canine monstrosity balanced atop her left shoulder, blood dripping off of its shattered jaw onto the front of her raincoat.

It was a miserable night to be out and about. The steady drizzle misting its way down past broken streetlights and grimy windows meant that most businesses foolhardy enough to operate out of this particularly godforsaken sliver of Revane had long since shuttered down for the night.

Some years ago, some starry-eyed politician had tried to breath new life into the Avenue in an attempt to combat the gang presence that had begun festering in the area.

Warehouses had been repurposed into food courts, a row of fountains had been built all the way down the main thoroughfare and business licenses had been handed out like candy at a fair. The poor man had even dug into his own coffers to commission an avenue of Grafted fruit trees that blossomed every morning, and grew heavy with fruit every night. Word was, he'd hoped that they'd act as a sort of secondary draw for his little shopping utopia; sipping coffee and dunking donuts underneath the Forever Trees, and all that.

When the day came to cut the ribbon on the Avenue, the man's dismembered corpse, as well as that of his poor assistant, were found scattered and spread out all the way up and down the street.

Every headline across the city ran with the same byline; a front page spread of an uncut ribbon, dangling in the morning sun. Beneath it, the politician's severed head, posed in a grotesque facsimile of a roguish wink atop an infamous gang sign. And beneath that, in large blood-streaked letters, the words, ""WELCOME SHOPPERS!""

There had been no coming back from that. The Downs added another notch to its belt, and the Shepherds kept their territory.

The figure paused momentarily, turning her considerable bulk to look past a small mound of refuse caught in the flickering glare of a storefront sign. Old graffiti glistened in the shape of a set of lupine incisors. The mark of the Shepherds.

Dumping her cargo next to a long disused fountain, she tested the stone work's integrity with her foot. Satisfied, she sat, scrunching her nose up a little at the mild hint of urine emanating from the fountain's stagnant pool.

Angling her rain coat's hood to keep away the worst of the drizzle, she rummaged inside her coat pocket for a few seconds, before eventually pulling out a small brown bag.

Something shifted to her right.

Emerging from the gloom of the fountain, on the side shadowed by one of the blinking streetlight above, a filthy figure, seemingly emboldened by the hint of food in the offing, held out his palms in timid supplication. Scars winked at her all along his emaciated palms and forearms where the man had taken on all sorts of crude Carvings. A Bloodletter, then. Probably surviving off of the trees.

The figure grinned, an expression that rightfully sowed the first hints of doubt somewhere in the clouded vacancies that were the beggar's eyes, and fully germinated when the giant of a woman pulled down the sides of the brown bag to reveal its contents: a severed hand, with a conspicuously mouth shaped chunk missing off of its side and a tattoo on its back that mirrored the tag that'd shed spied earlier.

Panic settled in, shaving the blunt edges off of the dullness in his eyes for a moment. He watched as she raised the bag to her mouth, revealing a double row of predatory teeth, and took a bite, her gaze never leaving his face.

She chewed, her foot resting on the humongous dog's haunches.

""You're not running.""

He shook his head.

""Not used to that."" She took another bite.

Her voice didn't sound like what you'd expect. The local monsters out here, those hired by the Shepherds and the other gangs to flex their muscle and push the locals around, never knew when to stop when it came to augments. Otis; for instance, down on Meat Row, had his voice carved to make you want to piss yourself every time he so much as growled.

This one didn't sound anything like that. Rather, she sounded like voice of an athlete he'd heard promoting some kind of protein shake a lifetime ago. Lively. Almost performative.

Still chewing, she waved the hand around. ""This fucker took something that belongs to me. Came here to get it back.""

The beggar blinked at her, resisting the urge to wipe away the sticky droplets of...fluid that got on his neck and face every time she gesticulated.

She spat out a finger bone.

""Know where I can find them?""

Fifteen minutes later, Bear found herself in a dark alley, her new friend standing passively to the side as the lookout positioned therein struggled and clawed against her forearm, his face completely engulfed in the palm of her hand. Tenacious bastard was taking too long to suffocate, so with a judicious twist of her wrist, she ended his struggles and let him crumple onto the ground.

Dead Eyes stared at her as she picked up her canine cargo once more, and sniffed the air. 

""That's the last of them. At least out here."" She sniffed the air some more. ""Bunch of them in there though.""

Situated at the tail end of the street, nesting in the gloom of a dozen broken streetlights, one of the refurbished warehouses pulsed with the light and sound of the sort of establishment where mistakes were made in abundance. A small crowd of individuals stood in a loose line outside its industrial sized double doors, negotiating with a pair of oversized bouncers, behind which a Carved dog-even large than the one she bore on her shoulder-stood vigil.

Bear looked down at her strange companion and grinned, her teeth glinting in the dark and stained with the evidence of her more recent meals.

""You weren't kidding. They aren't trying to hide at all.""

Dead Eyes shook his head. 

""You gonna stick around and watch?""

He shook his head again.

""Aw shucks, don't be like that. Tell you what, if you wait for me right here until I'm done, whatever drops they've got stashed in there, they're yours."" She stooped a little and patted the top of his head. ""Would you like that, my junkie friend?"" She cooed. ""Would you like to break whatever's left of your tired little mind?""

Dead eyes didn't respond. But when she stepped away, he stayed where he was, staring vacantly at nothing.

""Good boy.""

Bear stepped out of the alley way.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Bear felt the familiar burn as her Carvings kicked into action all along her spine and gullet. Making her way down the shadowed street, she could feel herself grow in size and bulk up as she converted her food stores into muscle and mass. 

It was the simplest and least subtle of her tricks, but that was OK. 

The dog reacted first, ears perking and rousing off its haunches as it caught her scent. One of the guard said something in a strange accent, before the both of them began to look around. 

Grabbing the dog on her shoulder by its neck to stabilize it, she laughed as both of her hearts kicked into high gear and adrenalin surged through her system. She begun to run.

Squinting through the drizzle, they caught her advance as she charged down the street. One of them barked something at the dog growling behind their back, and it rushed out to meet her. 

Bear picked up her pace, a phenomenon that the couch sized dog must not have been used to, as a hint of hesitancy bled into its pace. Still, it charged at it her, legs pumping and drool slobbering, before it judged the distance close enough and leapt at her, teeth bared. 

Bear felt her new tendons strain as her left foot bit into the asphalt, cratering a section of the road as she adjusted her trajectory just enough for the beast to sail just past her, but not before she twisted her head to the side and ripped out its throat with her teeth.

She didn't stop to watch where it landed as she swallowed and the Carvings in her throat got to work, flooding her with information: Three other dogs, one of them much much larger than the others, master's new cologne irritating her nose, yesterdays lunch, the taste of fear as it realized it was going to die, sleepy longing for its kennel as it reluctantly accompanied master out into the rain, the scent of a new batch of puppies...

Bear grinned at that last one. So these \*were\* the bastards that had stolen her newly adopted rescue from the pound...

The pair at the front of the warehouse wasted precious seconds panicking, as they tried to pull something out of their waistbands. 

""Nope."" Bear arrived, her momentum sending not a few unfortunate members of the crowd standing outside flying, and one screaming as she fell and bore the weight of Bear's passage on her shapely back. Bear swung her cargo like a baseball bat, wielding its neck like a hilt. The first one, the one who'd yelled something at the dog, ducked in time, throwing himself down onto the ground. The second one made a wet sound as he collided with the double doors.

Bear pivoted, turning her makeshift weapon in a large arc. Turning on the balls of her feet, she brought the creature down on the man's legs. The man howled. Bear laughed.

""Your dog hated your cologne, by the way.""   
  
She stomped and the howling stopped.  
  
The doors to the warehouse exploded outwards as a storm of teeth and claws charged out to meet her.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It took a while for the denizens schmoozing and gyrating inside the Shepherd's warehouse club to parse what the correct reaction was to a  gigantic dog sailing across the dance floor like a guided missile, bearing not a few tables and bodies in its wake.   
  
But when the even larger monstrosity that was the woman that followed in their wake, made her presence known by laughing uproariously as she strode into the club, another of the Shepherd's infamous monster dogs dangling on her barrel sized wrist as it attempted to worry it, a conclusion was arrived at.

Pandemonium broke.

Bear barely noticed the bodies streaming past her as she lifted the dog up to get a better look at it, all the while still gripping its long dead companion by its throat. 

This one looked to be more or less the same body type. Did these guys have a preference for mongrels?

She spied the Carvings on its chest and the back of its head. The workmanship was actually...not that bad. Someone in these guys' payroll knew what they were on about. 

Probably why they raided the pound, she thought as she casually snapped its neck and pulled it off her wrist. Almost passively, she redirected some of her stored mass into patching up the damage.

The club was emptying out quickly, and, as she looked up into the nosebleeds, she felt her hearts race as she caught a glimpse of a man with both hands on the railing. The rings on his hands looked as expensive as the bottle he held deceptively casually as he glared down at her. 

The darkness behind him shifted as a truly colossal dog eclipsed the VIP area's strobing lights and rumbled a challenge. On each of its incisors, Carvings glistened.

""Who in the ever loving fuck are you?"", the man called down. 

All around her, down on the dance floor, weapons bristled and knives shone. Music pulsed.

No more civilians left huh? Bear felt the heat from her spine and gullet spread in earnest.

""I'm a dog mom."" With a manic grin, she pointed whatever remained of her grisly makeshift weapon up into the balcony in a mock salute. ""And I'm here to get my girl back.""

1i8bjml,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1i8bjml/long_term_guest/,Long term guest,"There are 4 people in this timeliness of events. 
Me (OP, 33,f ish), Harry (34, M) Dick (33, M) Sally (28?, F).  Dick is Harry's best friend from HS. Dick and I were good friends in HS and I met Harry the year after I graduated. Dick and Sally are siblings.

Harry bought a house in a county neither of us are fond of and needed a roommate to help with bills and I'd just gotten out of a shitty situation with my landlords. Please note Harry and I have lived together on 2 other occasions. Once in our early 20s (when we were best friends), and once in 2020 (at another mutual friends house. I am not longer friends with that person. The reason is semi relevant). Sally also lives with us. She and I live on the top floor and share a bathroom. Harry stays in the basement. 

So Dick made some stupid life choices and his wife left him and took the kids. She's not being vindictive though and let the kids visit Dicks family for Christmas. So about 2 ish days before Christmas Dick comes to stay with us for a bit. It's great. Dick has a silver tongue. I mean he can laugh, talk, and charm his way in and out of most situations. He's a fun guy to be around. The day before Christmas he and Sally go to their family's home for the holiday. They are gone for about a week. Sally returns and Dick returns 2 days later...with his kids in tow. (This is new years eve I think. My cousin has come to visit) Strike 1. No one texted to let me know there were gonna be kids and my cousin and I had weed and liquor on the counter. 

That night Harry agrees to drop me and my cousin at a party and says he will pick us up. To just text him. I say are you sure? It will likely be after 2 am. He says yes. 
At 130 am I text him saying we were ready and he says he's too tired but that Dick will pay for our Uber home. Fine. 
The next day I went to the grocery store and got some stuff for breakfast for myself and my cousin. I forgot to get waffles for the kids but there's other food so they can eat that. 
A few days pass and the kids and Dick go back to his family home. 
He returns and is suppose to leave by the 6th. But ive seen his reluctance to go back home to the west coast. He doesn't have a home to return to so he will stay with some girl he was hooking up with. I tell him Harry would likely let him stay with us and that he could share my room/bed if he wants. (Yes Dick is hot and we've fooled around before but never hooked up. Not why I was offering tho) 


Anyway the 6th comes and I get home from work and guess who is still on the couch? Dick. He has also gone through the fridge with Harry and thrown stuff out. Strike 2. He doesn't live here and doesn't know what is mine, or Sally's. He threw out some of my stuff (and a container that I was keeping). I was irritated but whatever I guess. A few days later I get a text from Harry that Dick is gonna stay with us for a while and they will share a room. Fine. 
A day or so later I come home and almost immediately vomit. The entire kitchen looks different. Things have been rearranged. Strike 3. Im disoriented. Harry comes upstairs to the kitchen area and says hi. I beeline for my room where I have a rage induced panic attack and destroy a TV with a sword. A bit of an overreaction I know. But it was an awful feeling coming back to MY home, where I pay rent, looking so different.  They had moved my coffee maker, my kettle was missing just thrw me off. 


This happens 2 more times. After the first time Dick apologized. Says he has some adhd nervous energy and gets it out by cleaning. Im angry. 
HE DOESNT LIVE HERE. WHY IS HE REARANGING THINGS!??! why does Harry think this is okay???? And I know that Sally, Dick, and Harry are all alright with the changes but I'M not. And my opinion should count. 
another thing that happens is that Dick smokes hookah. Hookah makes me nauseous and gives me headache so I ask him not to smoke on the main floor. Go outside (like Sally and i do to smoke) or to the basement. He apologizes and agrees. 2 days later i come home and again smell hookah. I can't cook or utilize the main floor. I send a message to the landlord and tell him to tell his guest to stop smoking on the main floor because I (a paying tenant) can't utilize what I'm paying for. I also tell him to stop letting himself and his guest move my stuff in the common areas. Why would I tell the landlord this? Because Harry is the landlord. The more irritating part is that Harry and Dick are business partners (property management) and are using Harrys house to get business started. Harry responds to my message and agrees. There's an uneasy peace for a few days. 


Last week I got woken up at 1 am because Dick and Sally were laughing and talking LOUD as all hell. STRIKE 4!!!! I'm pissed. I got in my room for 30 ish minutes listening to the BS. And then go to the bathroom. What do I smell when I leave my room? FUCKING HOOKAH!!!! STRIKE 5!!! I go downstairs and say to Dick (Sally has gone to her room at this point) that if he doesn't want to hear my mouth about him smoking hookah on the main floor he needs to stfu at 1 am. He asks if they were loud and I glare and say as fuck dude. He apologizes. 
This dude (who i have a lot of love for. We are technically friends) has moved into my home, commandeered the living room, reorganized the kitchen (more than 1 time), smokes on the main floor even though he knows he's not supposed to and is now waking me up at night. I'm furious. I was late to work the next day because I have insomnia and couldn't go back to sleep til 4. I have to get up at 5 am to leave for work by 630. I woke up at 644. 
I text Dick and Sally and let them know I was upset about the disrespect. Dick apologized again and said that seeing his sister who he hasn't seen in awhile carried him away. BRO YOUVE BEEN WITH HER ALMOST EVEY DAY FOR A FUCKING MONTH. I also work 6 days week. I'm gone MINIMUM 7 HOURS A DAY. In all that time that I'm NOT HOME you can't Kiki with her???? From 630 pm(when I get home ish) to reasonable weeknight quiet time 10 pm, you can't laugh and talk to her then??? Sally doesn't apologize but deflects. Dick says we need a house meeting so EVERYONE'S needs can be met. HE. IS. A. GUEST.   He doesn't pay to live here. He just leeches off of Harry and Sally. He doesn't have a job. No car. Nothing. why should I do ANYTHING to accommodate him!?!? 

Harry, Dick, and Sally, have now been hanging out and doing stuff as a trio. Ive never been invited. Not that i want to. Im furious with all of them.

1i8bixj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1i8bixj/not_a_nazi_salute/,"""Not a nazi salute""","I, like many others here, have had to deal with Boomers being some of the worst people that can currently come to mind. They're standoffish, stubborn, rude, racist, sexist, nosy, bossy old relics from the early Jurassic who can't even use the computers they get scammed on all the time. But honestly, the worst thing they do is gaslight.

They've been doing this shit like breathing. It's just so ingrained in them that it's become pathological. If you're younger than them, having any complaints about the current era gets automatically smacked down, because boomers admitting to ANY points from a younger generation is paramount to losing a war. ""Life has always been hard"", ""you have it easy"", ""you're not a (insert high pay, extremely high chance of death job here), so you have no right to complain"", ""I used to do this while walking miles to and from the house in the snow, uphills both ways while raising and carrying a new born calf that I needed to bottle feed"", etc.

Now, we get Elon. Gen X, sure, but the Boomers adore him. It's disgusting. Just within the last few days, bro literally went and threw up what would be a nazi salute to the whole country. Nobody. Not a single person. At all. Nobody, could have done that motion, that salute, and made anywhere near a coherent argument that it wasn't what he did. But, that's where the Boomers come in. 

Almost every single Boomer I talk to has denied the fact that he did it. With photographs, videos, side by side comparisons with Hitler, white supremacist groups and other Nazis showing the exact same salute, and even Nick the fucking incel nazi Fuentes was geeking out about the fact that he did it. They still deny it.

My poor coffee lady had a medical condition within the last 2 years that has essentially taken hold of her life. She's elderly, her husband died waiting for VA help and has medical bills like crazy. She runs her own coffee stand on the side of where I work, so I liked to go and talk on lunch. She, as it turns out, is an enormous Trump supporter, who repeated every single thing that they were saying online to deny that Musk is a nazi. She started asking me 'what about' questions that were as easy as to say ""lock them both in jail"", and even went as far as to ask me:

""So if Trump supports a nazi, that makes him as bad as a Nazi?""

Me: ""yes.""

""Isn't that guilt by association?""

Me: ""if you're associating with Nazis, it doesn't matter who you are. You should be guilty for that""

She had nothing to respond to that with. I noticed that her whole thing was to get me to say that a Democrat was the solution, instead, I just stayed on point and called out exactly what I saw. The attempt to was to obfuscate the whole conversation by attempting to scatter to different topics. It was textbook Boomer online argumentation.

So I'm just sitting here with my McDonald's coffee today, just sorta wondering if she'll be okay. She already had to ask for a rent decrease from her also aging landlord, and has to have a lot of help from outside. This new presidency will be the end of her shop I think, and possibly her life. I don't hate her even though she literally voted for the nazi party, I pity the fact that she doesn't get that she voted for the party that told her they wouldn't care about her once they won.

What happened was that last year March, I quit smoking (35yrs of smoking) and I immediately started gaining weight and went from 220 to 250lbs. I'm 5'9"" so 220 was already considered overweight, but most people would never guess I was 220, more like 180.  But 250 is something I cannot live with, I am disgusted with myself the way I am, despite the fact that I was doing the 16:8, although my choices of food were absolutely terrible. 

I want to know if anyone familiar or doing 17:7 and how that worked out.   
So basically my first meal is at 1pm and my last is at 8pm and while I feel less bloated than before, I get extremely hungry by 11-12pm, because that's when I used to have my first meal of the day for decades. The problem is that I get so hungry by 1pm that everything considered food has to be hidden away or better - not have it home or I'll attempt to eat it.   


Anyway, so far I noticed I'm 246lbs right now from 251 last week, but I don't really trust small swings yet, I just hope that starving myself half of the day gets me somewhere. I gave up a lot of things, including bagels, morning coffee with milk and sugar. I drink the coffee black now, but I can't stand the taste of coffee all the sudden it's gross without sugar and milk so this morning I didn't even bother, but then I got really sleepy (and hungry) by mid day. 

Any recommendation what to eat? I'm getting a bit tired of eating whole grain bread with nothing and clementine and 20 million gallon of water. :( ",2,1737660035.0,intermittentfasting,1,1.0,False

I spoke to the pharmacist who reassured that the dose I took was still below the maximum amount, and explained that I might be feeling some mild high blood pressure symptoms and may have trouble falling asleep tonight.

So right now I have to consciously keep stopping myself from grinding my teeth, I’m in a very bad mood, and I can feel a headache brewing. 

If it has happened to you before, how did you manage your day? Do you have tips for a calming tea, a link to some relaxing video, or anything else? I tried to lie down and force myself to take a nap, but that obviously failed miserably and I couldn’t even keep my eyes closed.

Since starting thyroid I’ve been feeling the best I have in awhile but all the sudden my scalp is super itchy and dry all the time. There some scab parts too if I run my fingers through I can feel them, maybe it’s seb derm? My hair itself feels really dry and brittle and looks like it is getting thinner.

Anyway prior to starting thyroid this wasn’t an issue at all. Tracking my nutrient intake on chronometer there isn’t really anything sticking out. I thought it seemed like classical vitamin A deficiency but I eat liver and eggs and even started a retinyl palmitate supp but no improvements.

My digestion has been quite good lately so I’m not sure it’s caused by intestinal inflammation either. I eat lots of diary, fruits, potatoes, masa, gelatinous cuts of meat, eggs, rice, OJ, usually coffee and some well cooked greens as I crave them. I add about 40-60g of collagen to my coffee and smoothies each day. I eat oysters and liver every 7-10 days or so. Supplement wise I only take vitamin D and sometimes vitamin K if I’ve take aspirin that day. I’ve dropped the vit A after taking 50,000iu a day for a couple months and ruling out vitamin A as the culprit. 


Topically I’ve tried bloo, Nizoral and raw honey. Anybody have experience with this ? Or suggestions on what could cause it? 

Only theory I have right now is thiamine deficiency? But I’m not sure I fit symptoms of that just kindof landed in it from process of elimination. I’ve read thyroid can deplete thiamine? I get 200% or more of the RDA on thiamine according to Chronometer fwiw

He makes me laugh a lot, and we like the same things. He invited me to dinner two days later, on Friday, to go to a restaurant. He's very chivalrous, opens doors for me, arrives on time, pays the bill, and the conversation was so pleasant that we stayed together talking until 2 a.m. The next day, I decided to go to the movies and asked him to join me. He came to pick me up and paid for the tickets. He placed his hand on my thigh and asked for permission. He's really my type physically, and he makes me laugh a lot.
At the end of the movie, we kissed and stayed together until 3 a.m., talking and kissing. However, when he kisses me, I feel like he gets excited very quickly and often presses his body against mine.
I told him about a sexual assault I experienced in the past and explained that I'd like us to take our time because I get very stressed when things move too fast physically. He said he understood and thanked me for opening up to him.
The next day, he suggested we go out for coffee, and at the café, he kissed me three times. We talked a little less, and he told me that he had missed me a lot and would love to hug and kiss me.
Once we got into the car, he kissed me again and started doing what he had done before. He grabbed my butt, kissed me intensely, put his hands all over me, and I found it hard to set boundaries in the moment because I'm really attracted to him, but I have this deep feeling of fear in my body.
Sometimes he grabs the middle of my thigh, and I have to say ""no, I don't want to"" three times before he stops. Yesterday, I went to his place to watch a movie. We barely made it 10 minutes into the film before we started kissing, and once again, it all happened again.
He moved his body as if he was having sex with me but with clothes on, and afterward, I told him I was disappointed because l've brought this up three times, and I feel like he hasn't changed.
He apologized, said I was right, and promised to control himself, but he admitted he's struggling because I'm 100% his type, and he's been holding back sexually for a year to find the right person. He also told me that I'm partly responsible for the situation and that it's not just him.
I don't know what to do. I like him a lot, and he has many of the values I'm looking for in someone, but I don't like feeling like a sexual object under his control. Also, he wanted to invite me for coffee on Tuesday, but I told him I couldn’t because I had a lot to do at home and I was finishing work late. That evening, he called me to say that he had bought my favorite chocolate and that he would drop it off at my door along with a novel he recommended, and that I didn’t need to see him. But I still opened the door because I felt it would be impolite not to, and we ended up spending the evening together. I don’t know if it’s just me, but I feel like he doesn’t respect my boundaries. Keep in mind that all of this happened even though I met him for the first time last Wednesday.

The heard has been moving through different parts of my home. I've tried different traps in hopes of the ants bringing the stuff back to the nest to kill all the ants without success. My property management refuses to provide professional treatment, stating it's a ""tenant issue."" A lawyer advised me to have code enforcement come out since I am trying to go about this properly. By the time code enforcement comes out, the heard has disappeared because I moved my Keurig since they were going in it for the water and I was tired of deep cleaning it for 30 minutes a day to make coffee. There are still small groups of ants around though, which is apparently not significant enough for code enforcement who barely looked around. Didn't go through the whole house, didn't look outside, said it's not their job to look under the house to see if there is an infestation, they only cared if there was an active line of ants and some kind of property damage. I was told to reduce what attracts the ants into my home. Not really sure how to have a waterless home, but okay. Code enforcement blamed the dog food, but I haven't seen any ants in the dog food, I've also had my dog for 12 years grazing on his food without this much of an ant issue. They also blamed the trash, again, no ants in the trash. If they're really looking for food, why haven't they gone for the food yet?

I haven’t talked to her in a few weeks after a particular argument/fight between my brothers (I have two brothers total) & I, and her.

She texted me yesterday, basically apologizing and she mentioned that she & brother will be moving to a new apartment that is just down the street from where I live with my boyfriend (like 2 minutes away). The main reason for them moving there is because it’s closer to the university my brother attends, so it’s easier for him to commute without a car.

I really really do not want her living this close. My boyfriend & I love the small town we live in, and we love our home. We feel very safe & welcome in the small community, and we can see ourselves staying here long term. But I hate the thought of going to the grocery store or the coffee shop and seeing my mom there. It feels like an intrusion into my space & my life. I feel bad for feeling that way, as it’s ultimately because of my brother and his education for why they are moving there in particular. But there are so many other places they could have gone that are close to the school. The public transit system in the city is pretty reliable.

I just don’t know how to approach the situation. They have basically already signed the lease & everything, so the move is pretty much set in stone. So it’s too late to try and convince them to go somewhere else. And I definitely don’t want to move. Anyway - any advice is very much welcome & appreciated 🫶",7,1737659079.0,JUSTNOMIL,3,0.89,False

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Are you dreaming of a kitchen that combines charm with a touch of nostalgia? Vintage home decor is a winning choice to transform your kitchen into a cozy and inviting space. Whether you’re planning a full renovation or just want to add some vintage pieces, here are some tips and ideas to achieve that perfect retro look.

### Start with Color Schemes

One of the easiest ways to embrace a vintage kitchen vibe is by selecting the right color palette. Consider soft pastels or rich jewel tones, reminiscent of the 1950s and 1960s. Here are some popular options:

- Mint green paired with creamy whites
- Baby blue contrasted with sunny yellows
- Warm rust tones with neutral beige
- Classic black and white for a timeless appeal

A well-chosen color scheme sets the mood for your vintage home decor kitchen. Think of how light interacts with the colors, creating an atmosphere that feels both homey and stylish.

### Furniture and Fixtures

Vintage furniture can dramatically alter the overall decor. Look for items like:

- Farmhouse tables made of reclaimed wood
- Retro stools painted in vibrant colors
- Metallic light fixtures resembling those from the 1950s

You might also consider restoring an old cabinet or sideboard to serve as storage for your kitchen essentials. This not only adds character but also allows you to display vintage dishes or cookware.

### Accessorizing with Style

Accessorizing is where you can truly express your love for vintage decor. Consider these ideas:

- Display vintage cookbooks on open shelves for a charming library feel.
- Hang vintage aprons or tea towels on hooks for a nostalgic touch.

### Choose Retro Appliances

If you're ready for a bigger investment, consider choosing retro-style appliances. Brands now offer modern versions with the vintage flair you're seeking. Look for items like:

- Pastel-colored refrigerators

### Incorporate Vintage Flooring

Your flooring plays an important role in the vintage look. Look for options that exude charm:

- Patterened tiles, which were popular in the mid-20th century

### Mix and Match Styles

Don’t be afraid to mix different vintage styles! A classic farmhouse table pairs beautifully with 1960s-style chairs. Combining elements from various decades can create a unique and personalized space. Here are some combinations to consider:

- Industrial and country for a rustic chic vibe
- Art Deco accents within a more traditional setup
- Minimalist modern pieces contrasted with ornate vintage decor

Remember, the goal is to make the space feel inviting and reflect your personality.

By thoughtfully integrating these elements, you can create a stunning vintage home decor kitchen that reflects your style and warmth. With the right balance of colors, furniture, accessories, and appliances, your kitchen can become the heart of your home, full of character and charm.

##Prepare for our Next Developer Livestream


Heresy is right around the corner, so we wanted to give everyone an in-depth preview of what's to come when it launches on February 4. Our amazing developers are ready to tell you firsthand about the new activities, stories, and rewards they have been working on.



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltf8c09cd30402c27c/6791972979558dcf4d4d1717/Livestream_Tune-In.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/72sRCYP.jpeg)

Follow us on our [official Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/bungie) and tune in on January 28 at 10AM PT to discover what Heresy brings to the table.



Everyone watching the livestream on January 28 on the official Bungie Twitch channel for at least 15 minutes will get the Scorned Organ emblem as a Twitch Drop. It's the perfect sendoff for Revenant.


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt360064edbcf7e982/67919c8f58fb6d18518121f0/EN_Scorned_Organ.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eLJ8KkC.jpeg)



Don't forget about our other emblem available through Twitch at the moment. As part of Twitch's Drops Fest, you'll earn the Golden Hour emblem if you subscribe or gift a sub before January 31, 17:00 UTC.

##A New PvP and Trials of Osiris Experience


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltf9cadfa14edad6b8/679037f99d626e532611d501/saint.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hBXJjKX.jpeg)

This TWID would have been the biggest one yet if the PvP updates didn't end up having their own standalone article. In it, we covered many changes coming to the Crucible experience in general, and the Competitive and Trials of Osiris playlists in particular. We hope you are as excited about all the changes coming as we were telling you.



If you haven't read it yet, don’t miss it. [Here's the link!](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/heresy_crucible_updates)


##Content Delivery Plans for Heresy


Something we wanted to share today is that Heresy will have weekly content and story delivery.



We understand your concerns about our return to this approach, but we have learned a lot from the ‘all-in’ format in Revenant, so in Heresy we’re striking a balance between everything dropping on day one of an Act vs. meaningful reasons to log-in throughout the Episode. To that end we made the vast majority of activities content available on the first day of an Act, with said content evolving based on the weekly story. Additionally, each week will feature a Seasonal Challenge that rewards a new tier of seasonal Weapon. Check out the livestream next week for the first look at this Heretical Arsenal!



Without stepping into spoiler territory, we can also tell you that Heresy won't rely on a fixed length for each Act like the previous Episodes. For example, Act II will last three weeks instead of the standard five or six. Additionally, all reprised Weapons for the Episode will be available at launch, while all the second half of Episodic Weapons will be when Act II launches.



Our goal is to tell a satisfying and exciting story that both serves as an epilogue to the Light and Darkness Saga and that helps pave the way for what's to come when Codename: Frontiers launches later this year.


##Weapons and Armor Updates for Heresy


Now, the longest topic of this TWID: the weapons and armor preview with all the magnificent buffs and necessary nerfs, as well as interesting reworks, that are coming when Heresy launches. We are going to make a coffee pot and leave the room to the amazing Destiny 2 Sandbox Team. Be right back.


###Exotic Armor


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt1b38dbb3cad41a5b/67919f29e92e093e5ec659d1/Exotic_Armor.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/zxiaR63.jpeg)
####Hunter


**Sealed Ahamkara Grasps**



Sealed Ahamkara Grasps have struggled on Hunter due to the large array of alternate reload options that Hunters already had access to. We’ve reworked its behavior to have a bit more Exotic flair in terms of playstyle.



* Reworked with a weapon-swapping focus to differentiate it from other Hunter reload Exotics. Perk description now reads as follows:

   * Powered melee and finisher final blows grant Nightmare Fuel, increasing handling and airborne effectiveness. While active, freshly drawn weapons deal additional damage and grant Nightmare Fuel on final blows. Gaining Nightmare Fuel reloads all holstered weapons.

**Gwisin Vest**



With the recent roaming Super changes, we decided to give this Exotic a bit of tuning to let it shine in its role, as well as giving some utility outside of the Super.



* Now progresses its Super returns on Super hits as well as kills before becoming invisible.
* Improved the maximum possible Super energy gains per return while also increasing the amount of progress needed for maximum gains.
* Now also emits a cloud of weakening smoke when you exit invisibility while nearby an enemy.

   * Works both in neutral and while in Super.

**Renewal Grasps**



Now that Frost Armor has settled in the sandbox, we feel that Renewal Grasps can safely be more generous in granting it.



* Doubled the rate of Frost Armor gain while in the enhanced Duskfield grenade.

**Foetracer**



While Foetracer offers an excellent way to increase one’s damage, we’ve found that the benefit is too brief when compared to other alternatives. 



* Increased the bonus weapon damage duration from 10 seconds to 15 seconds.

**Radiant Dance Machines**



Radiant Dance Machines has been reworked to allow the multiple dodge charges that it grants to count as real dodges for the purposes of perks and aspects. The trigger mechanism for granting extra dodges requires more effort to compensate for that, but the overall change is a large increase in strength and utility. We have also added some flat benefits to Primary weapons that are a real gamechanger for players who prioritize gun feel and performance when mobile.



* Improves airborne effectiveness and hip fire mobility, range, and accuracy for Primary ammo weapons.
* Multi-kills with Primary ammo weapons refund dodge energy. When dodge energy is full, multi-kills grant extra charges. Powerful combatants and Guardians count as more than one kill.

**Relativism** - **Spirit of Galanor**



With the ability to regenerate a roamer more quickly than ever, it was quite easy to end up chaining roaming Supers back-to-back and effectively never need to rely on your weapons during activities. So, to combat this, we are reducing this capability a little on the armor side specifically for Silkstrike and Golden Gun.



* Reduced the maximum amount of energy refunded for Silkstrike and Golden Gun to 30% (down from 50%).

**Relativism** -**&nbsp;Spirit of the Foetracer**



Spirit of the Foetracer has inherited the changes made to Foetracer.


####Titan


**Citan's Ramparts**



Citan’s Ramparts was last adjusted to account for its problematic dominance in PVP, but that came at the cost of its value across the game. In the current sandbox, we’ve found that many of its downsides can be removed safely in PVE, even with the small buff that gives it in PVP, without introducing those toxic play patterns.



* Removed several downsides applied by Assault Barricade to bring it in line with base Towering Barricade behavior. Cumulatively, these changes result in a Towering barricade you can shoot through with no other downsides while Citan's is equipped (in PVE - see below).

   * Increased barricade health from 400 to 500.
   * No longer increases Barricade cooldown.
   * No longer decreases Barricade duration.
* Further increased damage dealt to Citan's barricades by Guardians from 125% to 160%.

   * This results in near-identical effective Barricade health in PVP (~2.5% less after these changes).

**Eternal Warrior**



We want Eternal Warrior to be an appealing option in both PvP and PvE for players interested in building into Fists of Havoc. We’re giving it increased Super duration on final blow – a nostalgic effect for longtime players that is thematically aligned with the Exotic.



* Final blows with Fists of Havoc now grant extended Super duration.

**Ursa Furiosa**



Our recent changes to Ursa Furiosa to integrate it with the Unbreakable aspect have yet to encourage significant use. So, we want to lean further into supporting Unbreakable by changing the energy returned by blocking with Unbreakable to be grenade energy.



* Blocking damage with Unbreakable now returns grenade energy instead of Super energy.

   * Grenade energy is returned at the end of Unbreakable and is scaled based on the amount of damage you blocked with it.

**Khepri’s Horn**



Khepri’s Horn is getting a glow-up: It will still causes your Barricade to emit waves of damaging Solar energy, but with this update they have been significantly enhanced.



* Now sends out three waves of flame instead of just one.

   * These waves no longer return towards the Barricade - they only travel outwards once.
   * Tracking on the waves has been enhanced.
   * Combatants damaged by these waves are enveloped in a Sunspot. Players are enveloped if they are defeated.
   * Now requires a Solar Super to be equipped to create the flame waves from the Barricade.

**An Insurmountable Skullfort**



As difficulty goes up, Skullfort can feel overly punishing when you fail to land the final blow it’s perk demands. To alleviate this issue, we are extending its effect to grant partial refunds from any melee attack to help rebuild that crucial momentum.



* Now grants energy to Arc melee abilities when hitting targets with any melee attack. Amount granted varies based on the melee used.

   * From most to least energy granted: Powered melees, non-Glaive unpowered melees while Knockout is active, and unpowered melees (including Glaives).

**Stoicism** -**&nbsp;Spirit of the Bear**



Spirit of the Bear has inherited the changes made to Ursa Furiosa.



**Stoicism** -**&nbsp;Spirit of the Horn**



Spirit of the Horn has inherited the changes made to Khepri’s Horn. On Thruster, Sprit of the Horn will now emit four waves in an X-pattern.


####Warlock


**Stormdancer’s Brace**



Much like Spirit of Galanor, we wanted to tune back how much returned energy was given for roaming Supers via Exotics. To compensate, we wanted to give Stormdancer’s Brace a little love in the potency granted to Stormtrance while you are in Super.



* Doubled the damage benefit per stack of Ascending amplitude (up to 20% per stack, from 10%).
* Now also reduces the cost of Ionic Blink during Super by 50%.
* Reduced the maximum amount of energy refunded to 30% (down from 50%).

**Geomag Stabilizers**



Part of the charm of Geomag Stabilizers was lost when sprinting to get Super was removed due to PvP issues. With the introduction of Bolt Charge to the Arc kit, there was an opportunity to bring this experience back without breaking PvP.



* Added a new perk: ""Sprinting while near max Bolt Charge will top it off.""

   * Starts at six stacks of Bolt Charge.
   * Reenabled VFX where boots spark while sprinting near max Bolt Charge.
* Increased Super energy gained from ionic traces to 7% from 2%.

**Secant Filaments (and Spirit of the Filaments)**



Ever since anti-Champion capabilities were expanded to work with elemental verbs inherently, Secant Filaments have felt like an Exotic lost to the flow of time. Giving it a satisfying loop felt like a nice way to give the perk some love for both the base Exotic and its Spirit counterpart.



* Now gives class ability energy per kill while Devour is active.

**Speaker’s Sight**



Speaker’s Sight paired with Ember of Benevolence allowed Warlocks to earn a massive amount of ability energy via the Healing Turret even if they and their fireteam were all at full health. Speaker’s Sight’s impact should be rooted in the actual healing of injured Guardians, so we are making a change to how the Healing Turret selects its targets.



* Healing Turret no longer targets allies at full health.

   * Allies need some damage done to their shields to be eligible targets.

**Verity’s Brow (and Spirit of Verity)**



The Death Throes buff is quite potent, but it is easy to let it run out and lose all your grenade benefit. We have updated this Exotic to bring it in line with how the similar Titan Exotic Wormgod Caress works: Stacks of Death Throes are now represented by a meter that decays backwards through each tier rather than falling off entirely when the duration elapses.



* Now uses a meter to track Death Throes

   * New durations per tier:

      * x1: 8 seconds
      * x2: 7 seconds
      * x3: 6 seconds
      * x4: 5 seconds
      * x5: 4 seconds
   * When one tier’s duration elapses, the buff will downgrade to the next lower tier rather than expiring entirely.
   * Bonus grenade recharge per tier:

      * x1: 0.5% per second
      * x2: 1% per second
      * x3: 1.5% per second
      * x4: 2% per second
      * x5: 2.5% per second
####Exotic Class Item Shared Perks


**Spirit of Verity**



Speaking of Verity, the above changes extend to the Exotic Class Item version as well. On top of this we are also giving some more of the base Exotic to the Spirit of version to help players build into grenades on Prismatic.



* Gained bonus grenade recharge rate, but provides 50% of the base Verity's Brow Exotic.
###Weapons

####Global


**Aim Assistance**



Destiny’s various aim systems are a foundational part of what makes Destiny’s guns feel like they do, but they do not come without some edge cases.



When using the controller input, we’ve taken a stab at trying to solve an issue where a quickly moving target crossing your vision could pull your aim off your previous target by introducing a time-based component.



We now weight aim assist against targets you’ve aimed at for a short time more strongly compared to brand-new targets when a new target is introduced by crossing your reticle.



We understand that this is a potentially wide-reaching change but have thus far been satisfied with the results in our playtests. Controller players, please let us know if you encounter any issues as a result of this change.



* Aiming at a target for a short time will prevent another target moving very quickly across your reticle from dragging your aim off it. Controller only.
####Weapon Archetypes & Subfamilies


**PvE Damage Tuning**



We’ve tuned up some low-performing weapon families in PvE to bring the competition a bit closer together when you are selecting weapons to use. These changes should help a number of archetypes that have been in need of some love for a while.



* Scout Rifles

   * +15% vs minors
   * +30% vs majors
* Auto Rifles

   * +10% vs minors and majors
* SMGs

   * +5% vs minors
   * Additionally, in 8.1.5.3 we increased base magazine size by 10-15% rounds based on the mag stat.
* Trace Rifles

   * +20% vs minors
* Linear Fusion Rifles

   * +10% vs all combatants

**Glaives**



Glaives have historically been a niche weapon type that has found it hard to break into mainstream usage. In this update, we are applying a sweeping buff to many of the Glaive’s baseline stats and behaviors to remove some of their unwieldiness and make them a more attractive and easy-to-use option.



With these changes, the intent is that Glaives become more agile and need to reload less often, are effective at longer ranges and more forgiving, and are more impactful when completing their full melee combo.



* Significantly increased Aim Assist, Aim Magnetism, and Damage Falloff Ranges across the board for all Glaives.
* Improved Glaive projectile hit registration.
* Increased the baseline effects at all stat values for:

   * Handling speeds, including shield ready speed and draw and stow speed.
   * Magazine size
   * Projectile speed
   * Reload speed
* Final hit of the melee combo deals double damage.

   * This hit also inflicts much more flinch on PvE combatants.

**Aggressive Frame Fusion Rifle(s)**



Only one Aggressive Frame Fusion Rifle exists within the game to date: Coriolis Force, issued back in Beyond Light. We’d like to give the subfamily a bit more love to try to sell its unique charged spread-shot gameplay with a complete rework.



The original fired its pellets all at once, so its recoil felt Shotgun-like. With the rework, we wanted to stay true to the Fusion Rifle performance of controlling your recoil over the burst, so we converted it to fire multiple bursts of pellets.



These shots suffer from damage falloff much less than conventional Fusions to compensate for their widespread angle and let the player fire into packs of PvE enemies and still score multiple kills.



Don’t worry, you won’t have to go get Coriolis Force on Europa if you want to try these changes out; new reworked Aggressive Frames with new perk pools are coming in this Episode.



* Aggressive Frame Fusion Rifles now fire three bursts of four pellets in increasingly wide spreads.
* Increased minimum damage when fully outside of damage falloff range from 45% to 65%.
* Increased range falloff start by 4m relative to normal Fusions.
* Increased range falloff end by 3m relative to other Fusions.
* Increased damage versus minors and majors by 15% relative to normal Fusions.

**Support-Frame Auto Rifles**



We’d like to support (*heh*) more Support Frame Auto Rifles in the future. Currently, their range stat is not especially desirable because of their unique projectile properties, so we took the opportunity to make range directly affect its healing performance by adjusting how far away the weapon can lock-on to and heal an ally.



No Hesitation remains close to its original behavior with this change with its base stats – this change primarily affects perks and mods applied to No Hesitation and opens more space for future Support Frames to differentiate themselves.



* Range now increases how far away you can heal another Guardian.

**Rocket-Assisted Frame Sidearms**



Rocket-Assisted Frame Sidearms shipped *particularly* potent while also being easy to use. We reduced the reserves for these in Revenant to bring their uptime a bit closer to other Special weapons, and with these changes we are moving these into a more defined niche; keeping them potent within that niche but being a bit less universally useful in all situations. With these changes they should remain a viable, ammo efficient option for clearing minor-, major-, and Champion-tiered targets with direct hits without also being great at killing everything nearby the primary target.



* Reduced PvE detonation damage by 45%.
* Increased PvE impact damage by 100%.
* Reduced Aim Assist falloff and maximum distance by 8m.
* Reduced magnetism falloff and maximum distance by 8m.
* Reduced damage by 30% vs boss, vehicle, and miniboss targets.

   * Buried Bloodline's body shot damage is unaffected, critical hit damage is buffed by 8%.
* The range stat was vestigial to the weapon subfamily, so we've removed it.

   * Range masterworks and enhanced intrinsics will be replaced with something more appropriate.
####Exotic Weapons


**Lorentz Driver**



Lorentz Driver was once a terror in the Crucible and has since caught a number of changes to its efficacy. Since then, it has struggled to compete in most activity types. We’ve made a few changes that will reward you for playing its bounty game successfully and keep it going into further encounters.



* Picking up a bounty tag now grants 1one ammo to the mag.
* Triggering Lagrangian Sight by picking up a bounty tag adds 6six ammo to the mag, the first time you trigger it.

   * Returns to adding one ammo per tag on extensions while the buff remains active.

**Delicate Tomb**



We’ve made a few adjustments to Delicate Tomb to help get it into its Tempest Cascade loop a bit more predictably and give it significantly more punch while buffed.



* Increased the chance to make an Ionic Trace from minor combatants from 4% to 10%.
* Increased the PvE damage bonus on the Tempest Cascade shot from 30% to 100%.
* Removed the timer from Tempest Cascade. Lasts until fired.

**D.A.R.C.I.**



D.A.R.C.I. has long struggled to compete with its Exotic brethren, so we are taking a stab at building a niche for it in a fireteam the way Gjallarhorn and Ergo Sum have found for their respective weapon types. This new catalyst should give you an edge up in encounters where Snipers may not previously have been viable.



* Added a new catalyst perk - Networked Targeting

   * Hits with Personal Assistant active grant you and nearby allies improved overall weapon performance and precision damage with non-Exotic Sniper Rifles.

      * Improves recoil, flinch, target acquisition, handling and precision damage.
      * Stacks up to 5x.
      * D.A.R.C.I also gets this buff itself.
   * D.A.R.C.I user also gets +15% damage after granting five stacks to a teammate.

**Edge of Action, Edge of Concurrence, Edge of Intent**



The class Exotic Glaives have felt a bit clunky since their addition to the game. We’ve made some changes here along with the global changes to Glaives that we help will smooth over the gameplay loops on each of these, as well as add additional neutral game value outside of the special shots.



* All Class Exotic Glaives

   * Special shot is no longer tied to Glaive energy.

      * Now triggered on six weapon hits to allow the special reload.

         * Increments off both shots and melee hits.
      * Edge of Concurrence

         * Effects of Jolting Feedback trait added to intrinsic perk.
      * Edge of Action

         * Effects of Destabilizing Rounds trait added to intrinsic perk.
      * Edge of Intent

         * Effects of Incandescent trait added to intrinsic perk.
         * Added Cure pulse to special shot impact.
         * Healing Turret no longer targets allies at full health.

            * Allies need some damage done to their shields to be eligible targets.

**Centrifuse**



Centrifuse’s perk that reloads the magazine while sprinting encourages pivoting and repositioning, but as it stands the magazine is just a tad restrictive and sometimes feels burdensome in PvE.



We’ve increased the magazine size to increase the potency of this perk and let you keep the weapon’s accumulated charge for longer before needing to reload.



* Increased mag size to 45.

**Dead Messenger, Hard Light, & Borealis**



We’re revisiting the Exotic perk “The Fundamentals” to modernize it a bit. Elemental keywords such as Restoration and Volatile have become a part of Destiny 2’s modern fundamentals. The stat bonus based on current element has been removed in favor of a damage bonus when you apply or receive an elemental keyword matching the current element. We’re also giving a small stat bump to Borealis since some high-skill PvP players have taken a liking to its current stat offerings.



* The Fundamentals:

   * New effect: Grants a 30% damage buff (10% in PvP) to this weapon for 10 seconds when you apply or receive an elemental keyword that matches the currently selected damage type of this weapon.
   * Removed Effect: No longer grants different stats based on current element.
* Borealis only: Increased Stability by 20 and Aim Assist by 10 to permanently grant it the Void element bonus that it will no longer have access to, since Borealis is a sleeper pick in PvP.

   * This bonus was selected over Arc, since there are more ways to gain Handling.

**Telesto**



Overall, Telesto is a solid weapon, but it lacks a solid high point in its power fantasy and does not interface with buildcrafting much. Additionally, the weapon has a unique dual identity as a weapon associated with the Awoken Harbingers in-universe and associated with a storied history of Telesto-specific bugs in our community. With that in mind, we gave it a buff that embraces both aspects and ties them together in a single, deeply self-referential package. How do you buff Telesto? Make it *more* Telesto.



* Telesto

   * Harbinger's Pulse:

      * Now only refills Telesto's ammo from reserves (instead of Telesto and your Kinetic slot weapon).
      * Now triggers with any Void final blow.
      * Final blow requirement increased from two to three, however Telesto final blows count double (in other words, will trigger from two Telesto final blows, one Telesto final blow + one other Void final blow, or three other Void final blows).
      * Multikill timer increased from 2 seconds to 4.5 seconds.
   * Catalyst

      * New perk: Harbinger Seethe
      * After three activations of Harbinger's Pulse, special reload the weapon to cause a rain of Telesto projectiles on your next direct hit.

**Vexcalibur**



With the buffs last season to Void Overshield’s effectiveness, it seemed like the weapon could use a few tweaks to take maximum advantage and emphasize the paladin-protector fantasy with its area overshield.



We’ve made it easier to generate guard energy in PvE when wading through enemies and quicker to apply overshield to your allies. As weapon made to hunt and kill the Vex, we figured this was also a good opportunity to reinforce this theme as well.



* Triggering 'Perpetual Loophole' (by scoring a melee kill while your overshield is active) now also fills your Glaive energy to full.
* Slightly increased Void Overshield trickle-on rate to nearby allies and yourself when guarding.
* Increased the potency of Vexcalibur’s (secret!) innate advantages against the Vex.

   * Vexcalibur's secret damage bonus when striking with its projectiles against a certain enemy faction has been increased from 10% to 25% to match Wish-Ender and Malfeasance.
   * Vexcalibur now briefly disorients non-boss Vex with its melee attack.

**Wardcliff Coil**



Wardcliff Coil is a classic weapon that is easy to use but lacks a niche in a lot of content. We want to double-down on the thematic chaos with a tie-in with the new Arc keyword Bolt Charge, which Wardcliff Coil will grant stacks of to all nearby allies when fired. This change should appeal to players who want to bring more firepower to their team without needing a game plan more complex than “stand near allies, look at enemies, pull trigger.”



* New intrinsic effect: Grants one stack of Bolt Charge to all nearby allies for every two rockets fired (four stacks per trigger pull).

**The Queenbreaker**



One of the most requested features for this weapon was to be able to special-reload to swap between the scopes while in game. We’ve added that functionality along with some other changes to make each scope’s firing mode feel unique.



* Players can special reload at any time to swap between scopes.
* Marksman Sights retains the previous behavior of firing a single shot that chains to nearby targets and blinds them.

   * The range of the chain has increased from 8 meters to 10 meters to make chaining easier.
* Combat Sights now alters the weapon to fire a three-round burst at a charge time of 533. Sustained damage on a target decreases the charge time of the weapon down to 300 charge time (with no loss to damage), useful for quickly dealing damage to bosses or other high health targets
* The scope that you select in the inspection screen will determine which scope is active by default when spawning into an activity.

**The Colony**



The previous changes to the Colony did some interesting things but it still ends up losing out to other grenade launchers due to its base gameplay and proximity detonation behavior. We’ve made a change to push this closer to other GLs in damage.



* Increased detonation damage by 40% -. This puts its damage per shot a little above Legendary Drum Grenade Launchers
* Increased number of bots spawned by 1one for all enemy tiers except players:

   * Player: 1
   * Minor: 1->2
   * Elite/Major: 2->3
   * Champion/Miniboss/Boss: 5->6

**Quicksilver Storm**



The previous changes to this weapon were a little too much, so we have rolled those back some.



* Reduced shots required to trigger a rocket by 17%.

**The Legend of Acrius**



Acrius has long been a viable but particularly niche pick. With the Shotgun changes doing well in the last release we wanted to give this a bit of love in that same theme.



* Reduced spread angle by 33%.
* Increased maximum projectile range from 12 to 18 meters.

**The Fourth Horseman**



Fourth Horseman has also been a particularly niche weapon. We’ve made some changes to help it excel at its mag dump weapon fantasy.



* Reduced the rate of fire slightly to give more control over wasting shots.
* Loads ammo from reserves to the magazine per kill.

**Lord of Wolves**



Lord of Wolves has had a storied history of terrorizing multiple parts of the game and has caught a number of nerfs because of it over the years. With the release and success of Choir of One, we have taken a similar approach to redesigning this iconic weapon.



* Increased range, reduced base damage.
* Removed accuracy penalties from standard fire mode.
* Release the Wolves now triggers on hip fire instead of special reload.

   * Fires full auto.
   * Greatly increased damage and rate of fire.
   * Reduced accuracy and range.
* Catalyst

   * Reload Speed and Stability boosts are now built in.
   * When Release the Wolves is active, dealing damage to targets scorches them.
   * When ADS, defeating targets spreads scorch to nearby combatants.

**Cloudstrike**



Since Bolt Charge is about creating a devastating lightning bolt, it seemed appropriate to interweave that with Cloudstrike’s gameplay loop.



For Bolt Charge, abilities are the only way discharge max stacks, unless you’re behind a Striker’s Storm’s Keep Barricade. These changes allow Cloudstrike to quickly build stacks, which can help bring back your melee abilities faster thanks to Bolt Charge, or cash in quickly with an extra Bolt Charge lightning attack when paired with Storm’s Keep.



* Added behavior to Stormbringer perk:

   * Rapid precision hits create a lightning storm at the point of impact and grants a stack of Bolt Charge.
* Added behavior to Mortal Polarity perk:

   * Precision final blows generate a lightning bolt at the target's location and grants a moderate amount of Bolt Charge.

**Thunderlord**



Since Cloudstrike was updated with Bolt Charge, it was only natural to turn our sights on the original lightning-creation menace. For Thunderlord, our goal was also to tie into what Thunderlord is already doing and reinforce its gameplay mechanic, which is generating lightning through sustained fire.



Similar to Cloudstrike, this means Thunderlord will be great at building stacks and melee ability energy but will also get an extra kick with a Bolt Charge lightning attack when paired with Storm’s Keep.



* Added behavior to Reign Havoc perk:

   * Final blows with this weapon generate lighting strikes from above. Lightning strikes grant a stack of Bolt Charge. Strong against Overload Champions.
####Weapon Perks


**Destabilizing Rounds**



Destabilizing Rounds has been a bit behind its elemental brethren since its initial release. We’ve given it a bit of love to narrow that gap and add some more value to each trigger.



* Now grants volatile rounds for 2s if any targets are hit by the volatile burst from the initial final blow.
* Reduced internal cooldown from 4s to 1.5s.

**Full Court**



With the release and popularity of Area Denial Grenade Launchers, we’ve gone back and added support for them on this perk.



* Now scales the detonation and burn damage of Area Denial Grenade Launchers.

**Ambitious Assassin**



Removed time requirements on the perk to make it more comparable to Envious Assassin, as this perk requires you to use ammo for the weapons this perk is on.



* Removed both multikill and reload timers.

**Flash Counter**



Flash counter had both a restrictive input timing and narrow activation condition that made it very difficult to consistently benefit from. Additionally, flash counter muddied our elemental rules by applying a weaken and slow off the Void element and Sstasis element.



We’ve opened the activation condition to trigger a blast in front of you while guarding against *any* damage, increased the damage of the blast, and made it disorient combatants.



* Reworked to read: ""Taking damage after guarding emits a disorienting blast.""

   * No longer requires a timed input or melee to trigger.
   * Deals moderate damage in a large cone in front of you, disorienting combatants.

##Prepare for our Next Developer Livestream


Heresy is right around the corner, so we wanted to give everyone an in-depth preview of what's to come when it launches on February 4. Our amazing developers are ready to tell you firsthand about the new activities, stories, and rewards they have been working on.



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltf8c09cd30402c27c/6791972979558dcf4d4d1717/Livestream_Tune-In.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/72sRCYP.jpeg)

Follow us on our [official Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/bungie) and tune in on January 28 at 10AM PT to discover what Heresy brings to the table.



Everyone watching the livestream on January 28 on the official Bungie Twitch channel for at least 15 minutes will get the Scorned Organ emblem as a Twitch Drop. It's the perfect sendoff for Revenant.


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt360064edbcf7e982/67919c8f58fb6d18518121f0/EN_Scorned_Organ.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eLJ8KkC.jpeg)



Don't forget about our other emblem available through Twitch at the moment. As part of Twitch's Drops Fest, you'll earn the Golden Hour emblem if you subscribe or gift a sub before January 31, 17:00 UTC.


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltb647f6ef39cf94dc/67919c8f6a4ee85918ad77c9/EN_Golden_Hour.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/IB2vwoN.jpeg)


##A New PvP and Trials of Osiris Experience


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltf9cadfa14edad6b8/679037f99d626e532611d501/saint.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hBXJjKX.jpeg)

This TWID would have been the biggest one yet if the PvP updates didn't end up having their own standalone article. In it, we covered many changes coming to the Crucible experience in general, and the Competitive and Trials of Osiris playlists in particular. We hope you are as excited about all the changes coming as we were telling you.



If you haven't read it yet, don’t miss it. [Here's the link!](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/heresy_crucible_updates)


##Content Delivery Plans for Heresy


Something we wanted to share today is that Heresy will have weekly content and story delivery.



We understand your concerns about our return to this approach, but we have learned a lot from the ‘all-in’ format in Revenant, so in Heresy we’re striking a balance between everything dropping on day one of an Act vs. meaningful reasons to log-in throughout the Episode. To that end we made the vast majority of activities content available on the first day of an Act, with said content evolving based on the weekly story. Additionally, each week will feature a Seasonal Challenge that rewards a new tier of seasonal Weapon. Check out the livestream next week for the first look at this Heretical Arsenal!



Without stepping into spoiler territory, we can also tell you that Heresy won't rely on a fixed length for each Act like the previous Episodes. For example, Act II will last three weeks instead of the standard five or six. Additionally, all reprised Weapons for the Episode will be available at launch, while all the second half of Episodic Weapons will be when Act II launches.



Our goal is to tell a satisfying and exciting story that both serves as an epilogue to the Light and Darkness Saga and that helps pave the way for what's to come when Codename: Frontiers launches later this year.


##Weapons and Armor Updates for Heresy


Now, the longest topic of this TWID: the weapons and armor preview with all the magnificent buffs and necessary nerfs, as well as interesting reworks, that are coming when Heresy launches. We are going to make a coffee pot and leave the room to the amazing Destiny 2 Sandbox Team. Be right back.


###Exotic Armor


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt1b38dbb3cad41a5b/67919f29e92e093e5ec659d1/Exotic_Armor.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/zxiaR63.jpeg)
####Hunter


**Sealed Ahamkara Grasps**



Sealed Ahamkara Grasps have struggled on Hunter due to the large array of alternate reload options that Hunters already had access to. We’ve reworked its behavior to have a bit more Exotic flair in terms of playstyle.



* Reworked with a weapon-swapping focus to differentiate it from other Hunter reload Exotics. Perk description now reads as follows:

   * Powered melee and finisher final blows grant Nightmare Fuel, increasing handling and airborne effectiveness. While active, freshly drawn weapons deal additional damage and grant Nightmare Fuel on final blows. Gaining Nightmare Fuel reloads all holstered weapons.

**Gwisin Vest**



With the recent roaming Super changes, we decided to give this Exotic a bit of tuning to let it shine in its role, as well as giving some utility outside of the Super.



* Now progresses its Super returns on Super hits as well as kills before becoming invisible.
* Improved the maximum possible Super energy gains per return while also increasing the amount of progress needed for maximum gains.
* Now also emits a cloud of weakening smoke when you exit invisibility while nearby an enemy.

   * Works both in neutral and while in Super.

**Renewal Grasps**



Now that Frost Armor has settled in the sandbox, we feel that Renewal Grasps can safely be more generous in granting it.



* Doubled the rate of Frost Armor gain while in the enhanced Duskfield grenade.

**Foetracer**



While Foetracer offers an excellent way to increase one’s damage, we’ve found that the benefit is too brief when compared to other alternatives. 



* Increased the bonus weapon damage duration from 10 seconds to 15 seconds.

**Radiant Dance Machines**



Radiant Dance Machines has been reworked to allow the multiple dodge charges that it grants to count as real dodges for the purposes of perks and aspects. The trigger mechanism for granting extra dodges requires more effort to compensate for that, but the overall change is a large increase in strength and utility. We have also added some flat benefits to Primary weapons that are a real gamechanger for players who prioritize gun feel and performance when mobile.



* Improves airborne effectiveness and hip fire mobility, range, and accuracy for Primary ammo weapons.
* Multi-kills with Primary ammo weapons refund dodge energy. When dodge energy is full, multi-kills grant extra charges. Powerful combatants and Guardians count as more than one kill.

**Relativism** - **Spirit of Galanor**



With the ability to regenerate a roamer more quickly than ever, it was quite easy to end up chaining roaming Supers back-to-back and effectively never need to rely on your weapons during activities. So, to combat this, we are reducing this capability a little on the armor side specifically for Silkstrike and Golden Gun.



* Reduced the maximum amount of energy refunded for Silkstrike and Golden Gun to 30% (down from 50%).

**Relativism** -**&nbsp;Spirit of the Foetracer**



Spirit of the Foetracer has inherited the changes made to Foetracer.


####Titan


**Citan's Ramparts**



Citan’s Ramparts was last adjusted to account for its problematic dominance in PVP, but that came at the cost of its value across the game. In the current sandbox, we’ve found that many of its downsides can be removed safely in PVE, even with the small buff that gives it in PVP, without introducing those toxic play patterns.



* Removed several downsides applied by Assault Barricade to bring it in line with base Towering Barricade behavior. Cumulatively, these changes result in a Towering barricade you can shoot through with no other downsides while Citan's is equipped (in PVE - see below).

   * Increased barricade health from 400 to 500.
   * No longer increases Barricade cooldown.
   * No longer decreases Barricade duration.
* Further increased damage dealt to Citan's barricades by Guardians from 125% to 160%.

   * This results in near-identical effective Barricade health in PVP (~2.5% less after these changes).

**Eternal Warrior**



We want Eternal Warrior to be an appealing option in both PvP and PvE for players interested in building into Fists of Havoc. We’re giving it increased Super duration on final blow – a nostalgic effect for longtime players that is thematically aligned with the Exotic.



* Final blows with Fists of Havoc now grant extended Super duration.

**Ursa Furiosa**



Our recent changes to Ursa Furiosa to integrate it with the Unbreakable aspect have yet to encourage significant use. So, we want to lean further into supporting Unbreakable by changing the energy returned by blocking with Unbreakable to be grenade energy.



* Blocking damage with Unbreakable now returns grenade energy instead of Super energy.

   * Grenade energy is returned at the end of Unbreakable and is scaled based on the amount of damage you blocked with it.

**Khepri’s Horn**



Khepri’s Horn is getting a glow-up: It will still causes your Barricade to emit waves of damaging Solar energy, but with this update they have been significantly enhanced.



* Now sends out three waves of flame instead of just one.

   * These waves no longer return towards the Barricade - they only travel outwards once.
   * Tracking on the waves has been enhanced.
   * Combatants damaged by these waves are enveloped in a Sunspot. Players are enveloped if they are defeated.
   * Now requires a Solar Super to be equipped to create the flame waves from the Barricade.

**An Insurmountable Skullfort**



As difficulty goes up, Skullfort can feel overly punishing when you fail to land the final blow it’s perk demands. To alleviate this issue, we are extending its effect to grant partial refunds from any melee attack to help rebuild that crucial momentum.



* Now grants energy to Arc melee abilities when hitting targets with any melee attack. Amount granted varies based on the melee used.

   * From most to least energy granted: Powered melees, non-Glaive unpowered melees while Knockout is active, and unpowered melees (including Glaives).

**Stoicism** -**&nbsp;Spirit of the Bear**



Spirit of the Bear has inherited the changes made to Ursa Furiosa.



**Stoicism** -**&nbsp;Spirit of the Horn**



Spirit of the Horn has inherited the changes made to Khepri’s Horn. On Thruster, Sprit of the Horn will now emit four waves in an X-pattern.


####Warlock


**Stormdancer’s Brace**



Much like Spirit of Galanor, we wanted to tune back how much returned energy was given for roaming Supers via Exotics. To compensate, we wanted to give Stormdancer’s Brace a little love in the potency granted to Stormtrance while you are in Super.



* Doubled the damage benefit per stack of Ascending amplitude (up to 20% per stack, from 10%).
* Now also reduces the cost of Ionic Blink during Super by 50%.
* Reduced the maximum amount of energy refunded to 30% (down from 50%).

**Geomag Stabilizers**



Part of the charm of Geomag Stabilizers was lost when sprinting to get Super was removed due to PvP issues. With the introduction of Bolt Charge to the Arc kit, there was an opportunity to bring this experience back without breaking PvP.



* Added a new perk: ""Sprinting while near max Bolt Charge will top it off.""

   * Starts at six stacks of Bolt Charge.
   * Reenabled VFX where boots spark while sprinting near max Bolt Charge.
* Increased Super energy gained from ionic traces to 7% from 2%.

**Secant Filaments (and Spirit of the Filaments)**



Ever since anti-Champion capabilities were expanded to work with elemental verbs inherently, Secant Filaments have felt like an Exotic lost to the flow of time. Giving it a satisfying loop felt like a nice way to give the perk some love for both the base Exotic and its Spirit counterpart.



* Now gives class ability energy per kill while Devour is active.

**Speaker’s Sight**



Speaker’s Sight paired with Ember of Benevolence allowed Warlocks to earn a massive amount of ability energy via the Healing Turret even if they and their fireteam were all at full health. Speaker’s Sight’s impact should be rooted in the actual healing of injured Guardians, so we are making a change to how the Healing Turret selects its targets.



* Healing Turret no longer targets allies at full health.

   * Allies need some damage done to their shields to be eligible targets.

**Verity’s Brow (and Spirit of Verity)**



The Death Throes buff is quite potent, but it is easy to let it run out and lose all your grenade benefit. We have updated this Exotic to bring it in line with how the similar Titan Exotic Wormgod Caress works: Stacks of Death Throes are now represented by a meter that decays backwards through each tier rather than falling off entirely when the duration elapses.



* Now uses a meter to track Death Throes

   * New durations per tier:

      * x1: 8 seconds
      * x2: 7 seconds
      * x3: 6 seconds
      * x4: 5 seconds
      * x5: 4 seconds
   * When one tier’s duration elapses, the buff will downgrade to the next lower tier rather than expiring entirely.
   * Bonus grenade recharge per tier:

      * x1: 0.5% per second
      * x2: 1% per second
      * x3: 1.5% per second
      * x4: 2% per second
      * x5: 2.5% per second
####Exotic Class Item Shared Perks


**Spirit of Verity**



Speaking of Verity, the above changes extend to the Exotic Class Item version as well. On top of this we are also giving some more of the base Exotic to the Spirit of version to help players build into grenades on Prismatic.



* Gained bonus grenade recharge rate, but provides 50% of the base Verity's Brow Exotic.

####Global


**Aim Assistance**



Destiny’s various aim systems are a foundational part of what makes Destiny’s guns feel like they do, but they do not come without some edge cases.



When using the controller input, we’ve taken a stab at trying to solve an issue where a quickly moving target crossing your vision could pull your aim off your previous target by introducing a time-based component.



We now weight aim assist against targets you’ve aimed at for a short time more strongly compared to brand-new targets when a new target is introduced by crossing your reticle.



We understand that this is a potentially wide-reaching change but have thus far been satisfied with the results in our playtests. Controller players, please let us know if you encounter any issues as a result of this change.



* Aiming at a target for a short time will prevent another target moving very quickly across your reticle from dragging your aim off it. Controller only.
####Weapon Archetypes & Subfamilies


**PvE Damage Tuning**



We’ve tuned up some low-performing weapon families in PvE to bring the competition a bit closer together when you are selecting weapons to use. These changes should help a number of archetypes that have been in need of some love for a while.



* Scout Rifles

   * +15% vs minors
   * +30% vs majors
* Auto Rifles

   * +10% vs minors and majors
* SMGs

   * +5% vs minors
   * Additionally, in 8.1.5.3 we increased base magazine size by 10-15% rounds based on the mag stat.
* Trace Rifles

   * +20% vs minors
* Linear Fusion Rifles

   * +10% vs all combatants

**Glaives**



Glaives have historically been a niche weapon type that has found it hard to break into mainstream usage. In this update, we are applying a sweeping buff to many of the Glaive’s baseline stats and behaviors to remove some of their unwieldiness and make them a more attractive and easy-to-use option.



With these changes, the intent is that Glaives become more agile and need to reload less often, are effective at longer ranges and more forgiving, and are more impactful when completing their full melee combo.



* Significantly increased Aim Assist, Aim Magnetism, and Damage Falloff Ranges across the board for all Glaives.
* Improved Glaive projectile hit registration.
* Increased the baseline effects at all stat values for:

   * Handling speeds, including shield ready speed and draw and stow speed.
   * Magazine size
   * Projectile speed
   * Reload speed
* Final hit of the melee combo deals double damage.

   * This hit also inflicts much more flinch on PvE combatants.

**Aggressive Frame Fusion Rifle(s)**



Only one Aggressive Frame Fusion Rifle exists within the game to date: Coriolis Force, issued back in Beyond Light. We’d like to give the subfamily a bit more love to try to sell its unique charged spread-shot gameplay with a complete rework.



The original fired its pellets all at once, so its recoil felt Shotgun-like. With the rework, we wanted to stay true to the Fusion Rifle performance of controlling your recoil over the burst, so we converted it to fire multiple bursts of pellets.



These shots suffer from damage falloff much less than conventional Fusions to compensate for their widespread angle and let the player fire into packs of PvE enemies and still score multiple kills.



Don’t worry, you won’t have to go get Coriolis Force on Europa if you want to try these changes out; new reworked Aggressive Frames with new perk pools are coming in this Episode.



* Aggressive Frame Fusion Rifles now fire three bursts of four pellets in increasingly wide spreads.
* Increased minimum damage when fully outside of damage falloff range from 45% to 65%.
* Increased range falloff start by 4m relative to normal Fusions.
* Increased range falloff end by 3m relative to other Fusions.
* Increased damage versus minors and majors by 15% relative to normal Fusions.

**Support-Frame Auto Rifles**



We’d like to support (*heh*) more Support Frame Auto Rifles in the future. Currently, their range stat is not especially desirable because of their unique projectile properties, so we took the opportunity to make range directly affect its healing performance by adjusting how far away the weapon can lock-on to and heal an ally.



No Hesitation remains close to its original behavior with this change with its base stats – this change primarily affects perks and mods applied to No Hesitation and opens more space for future Support Frames to differentiate themselves.



* Range now increases how far away you can heal another Guardian.

**Rocket-Assisted Frame Sidearms**



Rocket-Assisted Frame Sidearms shipped *particularly* potent while also being easy to use. We reduced the reserves for these in Revenant to bring their uptime a bit closer to other Special weapons, and with these changes we are moving these into a more defined niche; keeping them potent within that niche but being a bit less universally useful in all situations. With these changes they should remain a viable, ammo efficient option for clearing minor-, major-, and Champion-tiered targets with direct hits without also being great at killing everything nearby the primary target.



* Reduced PvE detonation damage by 45%.
* Increased PvE impact damage by 100%.
* Reduced Aim Assist falloff and maximum distance by 8m.
* Reduced magnetism falloff and maximum distance by 8m.
* Reduced damage by 30% vs boss, vehicle, and miniboss targets.

   * Buried Bloodline's body shot damage is unaffected, critical hit damage is buffed by 8%.
* The range stat was vestigial to the weapon subfamily, so we've removed it.

   * Range masterworks and enhanced intrinsics will be replaced with something more appropriate.
####Exotic Weapons


**Lorentz Driver**



Lorentz Driver was once a terror in the Crucible and has since caught a number of changes to its efficacy. Since then, it has struggled to compete in most activity types. We’ve made a few changes that will reward you for playing its bounty game successfully and keep it going into further encounters.



* Picking up a bounty tag now grants 1one ammo to the mag.
* Triggering Lagrangian Sight by picking up a bounty tag adds 6six ammo to the mag, the first time you trigger it.

   * Returns to adding one ammo per tag on extensions while the buff remains active.

**Delicate Tomb**



We’ve made a few adjustments to Delicate Tomb to help get it into its Tempest Cascade loop a bit more predictably and give it significantly more punch while buffed.



* Increased the chance to make an Ionic Trace from minor combatants from 4% to 10%.
* Increased the PvE damage bonus on the Tempest Cascade shot from 30% to 100%.
* Removed the timer from Tempest Cascade. Lasts until fired.

**D.A.R.C.I.**



D.A.R.C.I. has long struggled to compete with its Exotic brethren, so we are taking a stab at building a niche for it in a fireteam the way Gjallarhorn and Ergo Sum have found for their respective weapon types. This new catalyst should give you an edge up in encounters where Snipers may not previously have been viable.



* Added a new catalyst perk - Networked Targeting

   * Hits with Personal Assistant active grant you and nearby allies improved overall weapon performance and precision damage with non-Exotic Sniper Rifles.

      * Improves recoil, flinch, target acquisition, handling and precision damage.
      * Stacks up to 5x.
      * D.A.R.C.I also gets this buff itself.
   * D.A.R.C.I user also gets +15% damage after granting five stacks to a teammate.

**Edge of Action, Edge of Concurrence, Edge of Intent**



The class Exotic Glaives have felt a bit clunky since their addition to the game. We’ve made some changes here along with the global changes to Glaives that we help will smooth over the gameplay loops on each of these, as well as add additional neutral game value outside of the special shots.



* All Class Exotic Glaives

   * Special shot is no longer tied to Glaive energy.

      * Now triggered on six weapon hits to allow the special reload.

         * Increments off both shots and melee hits.
      * Edge of Concurrence

         * Effects of Jolting Feedback trait added to intrinsic perk.
      * Edge of Action

         * Effects of Destabilizing Rounds trait added to intrinsic perk.
      * Edge of Intent

         * Effects of Incandescent trait added to intrinsic perk.
         * Added Cure pulse to special shot impact.
         * Healing Turret no longer targets allies at full health.

            * Allies need some damage done to their shields to be eligible targets.

**Centrifuse**



Centrifuse’s perk that reloads the magazine while sprinting encourages pivoting and repositioning, but as it stands the magazine is just a tad restrictive and sometimes feels burdensome in PvE.



We’ve increased the magazine size to increase the potency of this perk and let you keep the weapon’s accumulated charge for longer before needing to reload.



* Increased mag size to 45.

**Dead Messenger, Hard Light, & Borealis**



We’re revisiting the Exotic perk “The Fundamentals” to modernize it a bit. Elemental keywords such as Restoration and Volatile have become a part of Destiny 2’s modern fundamentals. The stat bonus based on current element has been removed in favor of a damage bonus when you apply or receive an elemental keyword matching the current element. We’re also giving a small stat bump to Borealis since some high-skill PvP players have taken a liking to its current stat offerings.



* The Fundamentals:

   * New effect: Grants a 30% damage buff (10% in PvP) to this weapon for 10 seconds when you apply or receive an elemental keyword that matches the currently selected damage type of this weapon.
   * Removed Effect: No longer grants different stats based on current element.
* Borealis only: Increased Stability by 20 and Aim Assist by 10 to permanently grant it the Void element bonus that it will no longer have access to, since Borealis is a sleeper pick in PvP.

   * This bonus was selected over Arc, since there are more ways to gain Handling.

**Telesto**



Overall, Telesto is a solid weapon, but it lacks a solid high point in its power fantasy and does not interface with buildcrafting much. Additionally, the weapon has a unique dual identity as a weapon associated with the Awoken Harbingers in-universe and associated with a storied history of Telesto-specific bugs in our community. With that in mind, we gave it a buff that embraces both aspects and ties them together in a single, deeply self-referential package. How do you buff Telesto? Make it *more* Telesto.



* Telesto

   * Harbinger's Pulse:

      * Now only refills Telesto's ammo from reserves (instead of Telesto and your Kinetic slot weapon).
      * Now triggers with any Void final blow.
      * Final blow requirement increased from two to three, however Telesto final blows count double (in other words, will trigger from two Telesto final blows, one Telesto final blow + one other Void final blow, or three other Void final blows).
      * Multikill timer increased from 2 seconds to 4.5 seconds.
   * Catalyst

      * New perk: Harbinger Seethe
      * After three activations of Harbinger's Pulse, special reload the weapon to cause a rain of Telesto projectiles on your next direct hit.

**Vexcalibur**



With the buffs last season to Void Overshield’s effectiveness, it seemed like the weapon could use a few tweaks to take maximum advantage and emphasize the paladin-protector fantasy with its area overshield.



We’ve made it easier to generate guard energy in PvE when wading through enemies and quicker to apply overshield to your allies. As weapon made to hunt and kill the Vex, we figured this was also a good opportunity to reinforce this theme as well.



* Triggering 'Perpetual Loophole' (by scoring a melee kill while your overshield is active) now also fills your Glaive energy to full.
* Slightly increased Void Overshield trickle-on rate to nearby allies and yourself when guarding.
* Increased the potency of Vexcalibur’s (secret!) innate advantages against the Vex.

   * Vexcalibur's secret damage bonus when striking with its projectiles against a certain enemy faction has been increased from 10% to 25% to match Wish-Ender and Malfeasance.
   * Vexcalibur now briefly disorients non-boss Vex with its melee attack.

**Wardcliff Coil**



Wardcliff Coil is a classic weapon that is easy to use but lacks a niche in a lot of content. We want to double-down on the thematic chaos with a tie-in with the new Arc keyword Bolt Charge, which Wardcliff Coil will grant stacks of to all nearby allies when fired. This change should appeal to players who want to bring more firepower to their team without needing a game plan more complex than “stand near allies, look at enemies, pull trigger.”



* New intrinsic effect: Grants one stack of Bolt Charge to all nearby allies for every two rockets fired (four stacks per trigger pull).

**The Queenbreaker**



One of the most requested features for this weapon was to be able to special-reload to swap between the scopes while in game. We’ve added that functionality along with some other changes to make each scope’s firing mode feel unique.



* Players can special reload at any time to swap between scopes.
* Marksman Sights retains the previous behavior of firing a single shot that chains to nearby targets and blinds them.

   * The range of the chain has increased from 8 meters to 10 meters to make chaining easier.
* Combat Sights now alters the weapon to fire a three-round burst at a charge time of 533. Sustained damage on a target decreases the charge time of the weapon down to 300 charge time (with no loss to damage), useful for quickly dealing damage to bosses or other high health targets
* The scope that you select in the inspection screen will determine which scope is active by default when spawning into an activity.

**The Colony**



The previous changes to the Colony did some interesting things but it still ends up losing out to other grenade launchers due to its base gameplay and proximity detonation behavior. We’ve made a change to push this closer to other GLs in damage.



* Increased detonation damage by 40% -. This puts its damage per shot a little above Legendary Drum Grenade Launchers
* Increased number of bots spawned by 1one for all enemy tiers except players:

   * Player: 1
   * Minor: 1->2
   * Elite/Major: 2->3
   * Champion/Miniboss/Boss: 5->6

**Quicksilver Storm**



The previous changes to this weapon were a little too much, so we have rolled those back some.



* Reduced shots required to trigger a rocket by 17%.

**The Legend of Acrius**



Acrius has long been a viable but particularly niche pick. With the Shotgun changes doing well in the last release we wanted to give this a bit of love in that same theme.



* Reduced spread angle by 33%.
* Increased maximum projectile range from 12 to 18 meters.

**The Fourth Horseman**



Fourth Horseman has also been a particularly niche weapon. We’ve made some changes to help it excel at its mag dump weapon fantasy.



* Reduced the rate of fire slightly to give more control over wasting shots.
* Loads ammo from reserves to the magazine per kill.

**Lord of Wolves**



Lord of Wolves has had a storied history of terrorizing multiple parts of the game and has caught a number of nerfs because of it over the years. With the release and success of Choir of One, we have taken a similar approach to redesigning this iconic weapon.



* Increased range, reduced base damage.
* Removed accuracy penalties from standard fire mode.
* Release the Wolves now triggers on hip fire instead of special reload.

   * Fires full auto.
   * Greatly increased damage and rate of fire.
   * Reduced accuracy and range.
* Catalyst

   * Reload Speed and Stability boosts are now built in.
   * When Release the Wolves is active, dealing damage to targets scorches them.
   * When ADS, defeating targets spreads scorch to nearby combatants.

**Cloudstrike**



Since Bolt Charge is about creating a devastating lightning bolt, it seemed appropriate to interweave that with Cloudstrike’s gameplay loop.



For Bolt Charge, abilities are the only way discharge max stacks, unless you’re behind a Striker’s Storm’s Keep Barricade. These changes allow Cloudstrike to quickly build stacks, which can help bring back your melee abilities faster thanks to Bolt Charge, or cash in quickly with an extra Bolt Charge lightning attack when paired with Storm’s Keep.



* Added behavior to Stormbringer perk:

   * Rapid precision hits create a lightning storm at the point of impact and grants a stack of Bolt Charge.
* Added behavior to Mortal Polarity perk:

   * Precision final blows generate a lightning bolt at the target's location and grants a moderate amount of Bolt Charge.

**Thunderlord**



Since Cloudstrike was updated with Bolt Charge, it was only natural to turn our sights on the original lightning-creation menace. For Thunderlord, our goal was also to tie into what Thunderlord is already doing and reinforce its gameplay mechanic, which is generating lightning through sustained fire.



Similar to Cloudstrike, this means Thunderlord will be great at building stacks and melee ability energy but will also get an extra kick with a Bolt Charge lightning attack when paired with Storm’s Keep.



* Added behavior to Reign Havoc perk:

   * Final blows with this weapon generate lighting strikes from above. Lightning strikes grant a stack of Bolt Charge. Strong against Overload Champions.
####Weapon Perks


**Destabilizing Rounds**



Destabilizing Rounds has been a bit behind its elemental brethren since its initial release. We’ve given it a bit of love to narrow that gap and add some more value to each trigger.



* Now grants volatile rounds for 2s if any targets are hit by the volatile burst from the initial final blow.
* Reduced internal cooldown from 4s to 1.5s.

**Full Court**



With the release and popularity of Area Denial Grenade Launchers, we’ve gone back and added support for them on this perk.



* Now scales the detonation and burn damage of Area Denial Grenade Launchers.

**Ambitious Assassin**



Removed time requirements on the perk to make it more comparable to Envious Assassin, as this perk requires you to use ammo for the weapons this perk is on.



* Removed both multikill and reload timers.

**Flash Counter**



Flash counter had both a restrictive input timing and narrow activation condition that made it very difficult to consistently benefit from. Additionally, flash counter muddied our elemental rules by applying a weaken and slow off the Void element and Sstasis element.



We’ve opened the activation condition to trigger a blast in front of you while guarding against *any* damage, increased the damage of the blast, and made it disorient combatants.



* Reworked to read: ""Taking damage after guarding emits a disorienting blast.""

   * No longer requires a timed input or melee to trigger.
   * Deals moderate damage in a large cone in front of you, disorienting combatants.

So we have been together since fall 2015, he was 18 i was 24 or 5, don't get me wrong we've grown in so many ways together. We've gone through alot absalutly alot. From me having cancer to him loosing family and myself loosing family. To issues with my family and even me going homeless when we first met. We cheated on each other way back two times each and that was the end of it. 
All the wile supporting each other. We've grown financially significantly, and matured quiet a bit.
Or so I thaught. Wile spending the time together driving over 2500 miles and back we had many conversations. But the one that hit and was talked about was our excursions. Come to find out over the 9 or 10 yr span he didn't just cheat 2 times as I thaught. That number is closer to 28...and that number was not even a count but off the top.
See this hurts me because if he ever wanted to go to the bath house, or have threesums or just have sex with me I was always down. And he knew this.hell I even let him have sex with my older brother once.  And I would constantly ask to have sex or make love. And we would go weeks with nothing. 
I feel less than adequate, ugly, fat, not endowed enough. Not old enough. Too old. 
But I know I'm attractive, 6ft sandy blind, Bright ice turquoise Blue eyes,  175 lbs fit sorta look like if Alan Jackson and malcmore had a child. 7.5"" endowment. Vers. Smart well kept and clean. Not afraid to get dirty but clean up prettier than a new penny. 
I feel stupid, because ive done everything he's ever wanted, and I've given him everything, if he needed art supplies for his new gallery peices he got it. He wanted an Italian sports car he got it. 
New dogs, new home, moved 3 times across the country. I cook dinner from scratch every night, I make his coffee in the morning putting it into his cup and adding the creamer for him. If he wanted a couch from a magazine from the 1950s I bloody built it from scratch myself for him. You want a new fur coat boom which one do you want.
It hurts.. I work 46 hours a week, come home take care of the dogs, start dinner do a load of laundry and ask for sex beer and to go fishing twice a month.thats it.
I have no family anymore to go with. Rents are crazy here in az. Don't get me wrong I make 80k.
And I havnt been alone since 2015... he wouldn't be able to pay for anything and would most likely claim bankruptcy and loose it all.

I understand how the drink packages work. Trying to understand:

1. What if any NA drinks are included (free) and where on the ship. 

Like can I get iced tea or coffee in a dining room or at the buffet? Can my kids get milk or juice with breakfast?

Or are we stuck with just water if I don't buy a drink package?

2. Is the tap water safe to drink on board or do I need to bring bottles of water? Are there places other than a dining room or buffet to refill water bottles?

I message Rajeev and Sumit that I am not feeling well and am leaving for home. I reached home i think at 6. After some time I took the courage and broke the news to mummy and ritu. They were shocked but supportive. The children still smiled and all i could do was smile back. What is going to happen to them now ?

Today was school holiday of Shrinika so I got to take the Ather with me. I started office before 11. Continued with OPS Admin module testing. at 1 30 pm went for lunch. But didn't want to go back to office immediately. So went to Sikharchandi. Looked at teh view from top for 10 mins. Went back to office. 

After sometime gathered courage to talk to Sumit Dhal of DTR. He said they released me and Omprakash and Sujitha for budgeting reasons and didn't know Mindfire will lay me off. I made a request that daily office commute by bus is taking alot of time and even when i reach home I don't get enough time to study. So if I can work from home. He said he will talk to Rajeev Kumar of STR. 

Continued working. Then in evening Sumit confirmed I can work from home and work for 6 hrs so that I can give rest time to study. I Thanked him. After sometime it hit me that this could be my last day in office.

Suddenly a regret came over me that I am going to be out of corporate life soon. A guilt came that why I did not study for automation more sincerely. Now suddenly I found myself caring for the office space. I actually started to touch and feel the table, I looked around my office of what is where. I had the coffee from the machine even though i hate it. Had to add extra sugar. The 2nd time I actually threw it half way through. I went to bathroom more often than needed. These silly things that i had taken for granted in a corporate office space I felt like now I am going to miss them. 

On Jan 7 when Sumit asked me stop WFH and come to office I was aghast. Because of Shrinika's school the Ather had to remain at home while the bike is not working anymore. So I had to take Bus to office. Which was infrequent, crowded and so frustrating. There was no fixed time when a bus will arrive, so you just wait there. And there is no direct bus route from Infocity to Rasulgarh. So I have to change bus or take auto. I have rarely travelled by bus and even Auto fares are too expensive for me. The least hassle seems to be take the infocity bus that goes direct to railway station. Then cross the station to Puri Cuttack road and take a auto to ICICI bank square. While this allows least change of bus and auto but wastes a lot of time. It takes at least 1 hour 30 mins or even 2 hrs to reach home. I started hating going to office

Now I can work from home but today suddenly I felt a strange loneliness. I took sometime to go around the office, even went to top floor to see the view from there (it had already gotten dark so could see very little).

I think I am going delusional of being so attached to an office space that actually I was not fond of. I think it is the regret of missing out corporate life that is bugging me.",1,1737658364.0,u_rohits30041987,0,1.0,False

I thought it would be interesting to look into the differences between the organic cheddar squares (gosh what a mouthful lol) and regular cheez-it crackers. And wouldn’t you know it, one is highly processed junk and the other is highly processed ✨organic✨ junk.

But wait, the organic cheddar squares are less calories per serving!

Yes… by 10 calories. And I don’t know who’s weighing or counting out crackers. Besides, they’re healthy right? Which means I can eat half the box right??

And the Whole Foods Cheddar Squares are MORE EXPENSIVE while giving LESS product. Whole Food’s squares are listed on Amazon for $4.29 for 9.4 oz of product vs. a 12.4 oz box of Cheez-it’s being sold for $3.99 at Target. 

Sure, they are organic, but is buying organic cheddar squares going to make up for ice cream dates, lunch at the Cheesecake Factory, or daily whipped cream topped ice coffee filled with sweetened creamer?

People can buy and eat what they want, but it drives me up the wall that so many people don’t critically consume, whether it be through buying or eating food. 

If you want some cheez-its, just go buy some cheez-its. Or if you want organic cheddar squares, go ahead, but don’t think they are in any way healthy when it’s just greenwashed junk food. ",9,1737658124.0,alexandrarodriguez,4,1.0,False

this isn’t really a question, per se, more just me sharing my thoughts and feelings since I don’t have many gay friends who can relate. Also, I’m not here to judge anyone who enjoys hookup culture—these are just my personal experiences and how I’ve been feeling lately.

So, I lost my virginity last fall, and since then, I’ve been hooking up with guys through dating apps. The thing is, right from the start, I noticed that even when everything seems perfect, I always feel kind of… empty afterward. I can’t shake the feeling that there should be something *more* than just a one-night thing. And, honestly, it's really been bothering me.

I realize this might be more of a *me* thing—I've always been someone who connects with people quickly, maybe even too quickly, and I tend to open up a lot. It’s just how I am. I never really thought much about this until I realized how easily it can backfire, even when I try to build just friendships. I've been trying to control my feelings, but nothing I try really works.

A big part of what gets to me is that, after sex, guys often stop responding or disappear completely. I try not to take it personally because I know it’s just part of the hookup culture, but it still hits me hard every time. Even though I know it’s ""normal behavior"" I can’t help but feel like it reflects something wrong with me.

What really bothers me is that I actually enjoy the intimacy that comes before or after sex—simple things like grabbing a coffee, talking about life, or just walking in the park. For me, those moments feel meaningful. But once the “sex” part is over, it seems like the connection evaporates, and it feels like all the conversations we had didn’t matter. Which, in the end, probably didn’t.

I’ve come to terms with the fact that what I’m really looking for is something deeper, more stable, and intimate than just a casual hookup, but, especially where I live, it feels like that's nearly impossible to find.

Anyway I don't know where I'm going with this...but hey if anyone has found a way to balance the desire for physical connection with the need for something more meaningful don't be shy. Would love to hear your thoughts or advice. ",1,1737658018.0,askgaybros,3,1.0,False

We have both struggled with depression off and on for years, and for years we would take turns talking each other off the edge. When we were younger I didn’t mind this as I felt like I had somebody that was the same as me that I could relate to. 

Over the years our friendship became strained as I had found myself in an abusive relationship with a man, me and her stopped being friends at that point due to her not wanting to be around for the fallout of that relationship. No harm no foul, it hurt for a minute but I eventually understood her reasons. We had remained not talking for the entirety of that 3 year long relationship. 

After opening my eyes to things that I was going through I decided to break up with him. From that moment forward I started to work on myself. I started therapy, journaling, nature walks and found that my depression was starting to lift and I was much happier than I was before. It was in this time that not only did I find my wonderful current partner but she had also returned back into my life. 

It started all great, we would meet up for coffees and lunch and talk about the things that we had missed with each other. Slowly it turned into her only sending me depressing messages such as: “I don’t want to try anymore” “I hope I don’t wake up” things along those lines. In an effort to be as close as we used to I decided to resume my friend duties of talking her off the ledge. Now I don’t mind doing this every once and again. The problem here is it’s. Every. Single. Day. Multiple. Times. A. Day. and I’m starting to notice that after I’m done talking to her I feel depressed and drained of all energy. 

I haven’t expressed anything to her yet as I don’t want her to take it as me saying I want her out of my life again. But I was genuinely happy with the improvements I was making in my own mental health, I’m worried that this would greatly impact me if I allowed it to continue. So, would I be the asshole if I told her I no longer wanted to hear about her depression, and I don’t want to be her life-line anymore? ",1,1737657805.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

My husband does his absolute best to take me on outings and keep me company, and has suggested going on a date night/trip but I feel too much anxiety to leave my baby with anyone and know I wouldn't have fun. 

I don't really have any hobbies outside of baking and video games, taking care of my son is kind of an all consuming fog, and I'm wondering if this feeling ever ends? He's the best thing that's ever happened to me but I didn't realize how isolating motherhood would be. ",24,1737657621.0,NewParents,10,0.94,False

1i8aef3,https://i.redd.it/wxeavadefsee1.jpeg,"Started from no babbling and no eye contact, but look at us now at 2.5 year old (HF)","Our journey started at 14 months when I noticed our son didn’t babble, didn’t have eye contact, no pointing, no sharing, no joint attention. Looking back at old videos in his first year, he was doing lots of eye contact and babbling, but that changed. I took him to Speech Therapist who assessed that he was 6 months delayed in language and communication. We didn’t want official diagnosis yet so we started home ABA therapy at 15 months old, 10-20 hours a week. We wanted to do more hours but he would get tired and grumpy in the afternoon so essentially only had 2 hours in the mornings available while his brain was fresh. He used to spin objects, which is called inappropriate play, flap hands when excited, loved TV, he is a sensory seeker.

The eye contact starting emerging in the following 3-4 months, he said his first word “eight” (he loves numbers) at 18-20 months. By the age of two he had vocabulary about 30 words. Pointing arrived at 20 months. Pretty poor pointing, but improved a lot by now. We practiced pointing A LOT in therapy! Nothing arrived naturally for him, we had to fight for every ounce of progress. 

His receptive language has always been poor but learnt  through therapy to understand some requests.  We discovered when he was 2 that he could read lots of words, taught himself to read basically , maybe 30-40 words, he has mild hyperlexia, loves numbers, too. Since the age of 2, he could count to 10 and a bit above . 

Yesterday, at his age of 2.5y old,  we had a therapy session at which he got assessed as being at the level of the two year old. That means that his progress is steady, no regressions, and that’s a huge success. Therapist said that most likely, as long as progress continuous like this, that by the age of 4-5 he will not need speech therapy anymore because he will catch up with his peers. At that age he will likely need help with his social skills, like taking turns in conversation and not talking intensely about his own interest to others, learning body language, etc.

At this moment our son can put 2-3 words together like “green car”, “yellow banana”, “I want milk”,…. He is still struggling to join verbs with nouns, for example can’t say “come mummy”, but that is slowly coming. His receptive language is much better and most of the things we ask him to do ,as long as they are easy, like “put water on table” “bring your shoes”, he will do that.  We had to do lots of therapy to teach him “give”, “show me” “take” “put” “bring”, ... weeks of work for each word.  I have another post of the type of therapy we used to do, it is called Early Start Denver, I bought a book, which is essentially a manual for parents, and with our therapist steering us and helping us with monthly sessions, we did it all through play at home. 

He talks a lot now, but third of the time he talks to himself and we hear him repeating phrases from TV programs, like he is replaying the situations in his head. Has troubles falling asleep, but luckily then sleeps 10-11h straight. He eats about 20 different foods (I counted), still doesn’t want to use spoon (his hand is limp around it, he is just not interested), but will take food with fingers and sometimes with fork, I’m happy with that for now. He chews slowly , and won’t take another bite until he swallows the first one, so  feeding him is a 20 minutes task. Luckily, he loves chips, watermelon, kiwi, raisins, we have that consistently on the coffee table for him to reach. 

Motor gross and fine motor skills are good. Loves running around,  climbing. When I bring him to the playground, he will just start randomly running to a certain direction and you have to run after him. I called him “a dasher” lol 

He enjoys company of other kids. If they play the game he likes he will happily play around them in parallel , but if the game has no interest for him he sits in the corner and does his own thing, usually shapes, blocks. 

Eye contact has improved immensely, but we did lots of therapy with that, and are still doing it. He is good now at saying Yes or No, at making choices, at pointing, joint attention is miles better. 

I give him high dose fish oil few times a week, and daily dose of baby probiotic drops. Tried some vitamins but he wouldn’t take them. He eats plenty of fruit, various snacks, bolognese, little red kiddy sausages , drinks 3 bottles of milk a day (plenty of B12 vitamin and  protein), I try to expose him to sun daily for vitamin D, although New Zealand weather is often cloudy.

Our future work with him is functional language, for example asking “Can I watch TV?” Instead of getting stuck into “I want this” and “I want that” pattern, and  even bigger task is his creative play. Autistic kids are notoriously bad in creativity. He is not creative by nature, playdough doesn’t interest him, he is very analytical, likes putting shapes together and numbers and words .  I’m still to receive tasks for the creativity, so I don’t know yet how we are going to develop his creativity.  Can update that later below, in few days. 

Hope this all helps if your child has started from the similar point of development. ",19,1737657337.0,Autism_Parenting,1,1.0,False

1i8ae7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1i8ae7x/i_need_help_with_libido_long_description/,I need help with libido (long description),"Hello everyone, I'm writing because I need help. I'm a 25-year-old male.
As the title suggests, I have a libido issue that has persisted since I was 18. After a brief period of sudden anxiety without any apparent reason (which lasted about three weeks and resolved on its own without medication), I went from having a very high libido to virtually zero, with refractory periods lasting entire days.

Over the years, I've tried everything legal to boost libido, targeting dopamine, glutamate, and testosterone stimulation. Here’s a brief list of the most impactful substances I’ve tried, none of which yielded significant results:

Hormonal attempts:

Enclomiphene: Although my testosterone levels are naturally high (around 800 ng/dl), I tried this approach anyway.

Proviron/mesterolone: Tried to stimulate DHT with no results here either.


Dopaminergic attempts:

Bromantane/ALCAR/forskolin: These helped improve motivation, focus, and overall vitality but had no effect on libido.

Optimized methylation cycles and addressed various deficiencies, resulting in extreme energy but no change in libido.

Matcha tea or other COMT inhibitors: Increased dopamine/norepinephrine levels, with results similar to the above.

Bupropion: Caused severe side effects like panic attacks and anxiety after just one dose of the XL version. However, upon stopping it, I experienced a rebound in libido that lasted a few days.


Glutamate attempts:

Sarcosine: The first time I used it, I had a severe headache, but when it passed, I experienced increased libido for about two days. After that, the effect (and the headache) never returned, so I stopped using it.

D-aspartic acid: Led to a significant increase in libido but also caused heightened anxiety. I suspect this effect was more related to NMDA receptor agonism rather than testosterone stimulation.

Alcohol afterglow: High libido and low anxiety, but obviously not a long-term solution.

Nicotine pouches (microdosing): Increased agitation and focus. Interestingly, I never developed a dependency and now only use it sporadically when I need a stronger kick than coffee provides.


During DNA testing, where I discovered issues with folic acid absorption, I also found:

Variants linked to upregulated D2 dopamine receptor density, which I understand can lead to inhibitory states if excessive.

A variant in the DBH gene, which is responsible for converting dopamine into norepinephrine.


Combining these findings, I wonder if low conversion rates are causing excess dopamine, which, by binding more to D2 receptors, might create a continuous inhibitory state and thus lead to low libido. At the same time, why did bupropion cause excessive anxiety (even at 1/4 of a pill) but lead to a libido rebound after stopping? Why are glutamate agonists the only substances that have significantly increased my libido?

Now comes my request for help:
Are there any natural D2 receptor antagonists or nootropics (not antipsychotics) that I could try? Or are there any NMDA receptor agonists that might be more effective for libido?

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide—I’m really desperate.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Maybe it was the idealization, her euphoric demeanor in the beginning, the person she is, I don't know.

She came from a terrible past and suffers from other illnesses too like Bipolar Disorder and Depression. But it didn't matter to me. Maybe it was a savior complex when I tried to talk about her problems and how some of it shouldn't bother her (Like insecurity). I cheered her up at times where she felt insecure or depressed. I was happy with her even when she was feeling down and I always tried to make her smile by buying her favorite coffee's from Starbucks or random plushies / room decor. I pieced it together halfway through the relationship she could have BPD as she wasn't formally diagnosed with it. Around that time is when the arguments started, it being almost always my fault. Usually because of triggers but I was patient and learned to apologize and correct my behavior (Which to be fair, I made a mistake once and its treated like I hate her.)

I had to hold her from breaking up with me, she suggested it because ""All we do is argue"" which was far from the case. I thought that if I prove to her that I'm the man she fell in love with in the beginning she would stay and feel a little secure. But, she broke up with me near the end because she kept complaining and it was just pain for two days. I reached out to her trying to make amends and I discover she was ""Coerced"" by her ex to be with him again. I drove 40 minutes from my house to come rescue her and I could see the sadness in her eyes and body language. I told her she cannot do this to me again if she wants to be with me and she apologized and agreed.

A few days go by and she becomes cold in the relationship. Starts arguments over little things (Like sending her an instagram reel before texting her good morning). She tells me she wants to breakup and I give up and accept that she pushed me away for good. I come to pick up a hoodie from her home and when I see her sitting on the porch smoking a cigarette, she looked emotionless. She never looked at me. I told her ""I'm not good with goodbyes, but I wanna wish you the best for everything"". I don't remember what she said, and I don't want to.

I'm sad its over. I'm also glad its over. But I still love her which I hate. When I came into her life she was so happy and optimistic (In the beginning, obviously), and I knew that she didn't mean to hurt me and that her splitting wasn't in her control. Yes she should've gotten therapy for it, but she was never diagnosed and I wish I brought it up to her that she could have BPD, but she probably would have been defensive or argued with me about how mental illness doesn't define her. I reassured her as many times as I could and I even asked her if she was afraid to love me because she could lose me and I got her answer, and yet it consumed the relationship. All because of her fear of abandonment, or her fear of love.

Should I be thankful its over? It was someone I deeply cared about, even through the good and bad.",4,1737656863.0,BPDlovedones,2,1.0,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Never had stomach pain, constipation, or diarrhea. 

This month, due to the reflux, I had an endoscopy. The pathology showed my lactase enzyme level at 6.58 units (normal: >/=14.0). 

Because of the reflux, my GI doc has said I should start taking Lactaid beforehand when I plan to consume dairy, since the lactase deficiency means the dairy will sit in my stomach longer, where it will stimulate acid production, which is counterproductive for the high-pH gut environment I need to create at this time to heal from the reflux.

Once I heal, though, should I just sort of see how it goes without the Lactaid again? How many folks here have pathology showing low lactase but no symptoms?",0,1737656659.0,lactoseintolerant,0,0.5,False

I don’t get the time off that I need (the days my therapist is able to meet) even though I have the most seniority (in terms of how long I’ve been there) in the branch of the department I work in.

For my part, I was talking about an episode I had seen a long time ago and thought was from ""Seinfeld"". Everyone in the group liked what I told them and asked me to identify which episode the situation was from.  
From that point on, things started to get sticky. Because no matter what I did that night, I couldn't find a scene like the one I mentioned in Seinfeld. At this point I began to think that my memory was failing me and that this scene might be from another sitcom. The funny thing was that I realized that I could adapt that scene to any comedy show I watched. The more I thought about it, the more confused I got. I tried to get help from ChatGPT. It suggested it might be from Friends. (S07E11) No way. ChatGPT then went scorched earth with *Two and a Half Men*, *It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,* *Fraiser*, *How I Met Your Mother*.

Now if I'm lucky someone who comes across this post and has also seen this episode of this show will decide to wake me up from this nightmare. My own brother even says I might have made it all up.  
In this scene I remember, there are two male friends and one of them is dating a woman, but the other friend thinks that this woman is also interested in him. The guy who's dating the woman doesn't believe him. He says she's just being friendly. He keeps saying that there's nothing suspicious about her behavior. The man then tries to ignore all the woman's moves on him.  
In one scene, the woman spills coffee or something on the guy and he has to take off his clothes and they eventually end up dancing in their underwear and he keeps saying himself ""Nothing's wrong. Everything is normal. We're just having fun"". Finally the woman admits that she wants to try a threesome with them.",2,1737656563.0,tipofmytongue,2,1.0,False
1i8a1rg,https://i.redd.it/w4ad3g7xcsee1.jpeg,Advice on Joining Stitch for My Charity Daisy Blanket Project!,"Hi everyone!

I’ve been working on a queen-sized Charity Daisy blanket for the past year, and I’m finally getting close to the joining phase—exciting, but a little daunting! I’ve made 70 squares so far, and I’m almost ready to start joining them together. I’d love your advice on choosing a joining stitch that would look nice with my multi-colored squares.

I’m planning to add an 8th color for the joining and the border, and I’m leaning toward something like a deep rusty orange or a medium coffee-with-cream brown. Do you think either of those would work, or do you have other suggestions?

Also, here’s a little hiccup: I’ve made these squares over the past year in a variety of settings and mindsets (as one does), so they’re not all perfectly consistent. During blocking, I noticed some squares have a slight stitch-count variation—plus or minus 1 to 2 stitches on the outer border. Most are the same size, but a few aren’t.

I’d love suggestions for a joining stitch that might help disguise these inconsistencies while still looking great with the overall design.

Any tips or tricks are welcome, and I’m so grateful for your expertise! I’ve included an older progress photo as tax—hope you enjoy seeing how far this project has come.

Thanks in advance for your help & advice!",25,1737656502.0,CrochetHelp,6,0.96,False

The only communication or connection we have had the past couple years is texting. We text about news events, weather and politics. Anyway, I texted him the other day with a pic of some deer I saw on my  walk in the park. He texted back that there are quite a few in his neighborhood and many of the neighbors are getting fed up with them cause they go through their yards and make a mess. I texted him back saying I feel sorry for the wildlife since it seems all the natural areas in this city are being torn down to build yet another Walgreens/CVS, gas station, or Coffee Shop. After that I hadn't received any texts from him, nor a reply to a couple that I had sent. I finally texted him and asked if he is still alive. He texted back that he has been busy picking up deer poop. WTF? Is this something to get pissed off about? It's TOTALLY ridiculous! I know there are a lot of people that could care less about the wildlife, but my goodness, I didn't say anything that should have upset him, other than I feel sorry for the wildlife.",2,1737656454.0,family,2,1.0,False

Like the title says, I’m a Mexican male just turned 29 years, been living in Dubai for the last 5 months and I’m looking for a significant other to explore this wonderful city and it’s surroundings. 

I like deep talks, walks by the beach, dancing (though I have two left feet lol) going to the movies, trying new cuisines and learn about other cultures, coffee, taking pictures and animals (specially cats but I’m also a dog person) 

I’m looking for a serious, long term relationship (I’m straight).

She has passed away due to unknown reasons in 2020 and she is, and has always been my favorite person in the entire world. Her name was ""Gülseren"" which means ""blossoming rose/ blossoming as roses"" in Turkish. She loved instant coffee. Whenever i visited her, she would always make me some coffee and she somehow knew the best combination of coffee, sugar and milk and i still can't do it like her to this day. I loved her coffee so much that i didn't make myself any a week prior to the date i was supposed to be seeing her, thinking ""I just want to drink her coffee"" but she passed away a day before my flight. Even on her funeral, i was thinking about how we never got to have our little coffee chat on her small balcony. 

So here's my idea, I'll get something with a coffee cup and roses. It could be a rose pattern on the cup. It could be roses around or floating inside the cup. I haven't decided which one yet but the idea is there. 

I'm a 24 year old woman, by the way if it matters at all. ",4,1737656315.0,tattooadvice,6,1.0,False

☀️This Tiramisu Chia Pudding is my new breakfast obsession. With only 5 ingredients, it takes less than 5 minutes to prepare. It’s the perfect motivation to kickstart your morning!

✨Ingredients:
-1 cup high protein yogurt 
-2 tbsp chia seeds
-1/4 cup coffee / espresso
-1 tbsp maple syrup or honey
-cacao powder (for topping)

✨Instructions:
1️⃣In a bowl, mix together the yogurt, chia seeds, coffee, and maple syrup.
2️⃣Refrigerate for a few hours or overnight to allow the chia seeds to absorb the liquid and thicken the mixture.
3️⃣Once ready, sprinkle cacao powder on top before serving.
‼️You can adjust the sweetness or caffeine level to taste.

☕️☀️The most simple, easy breakfast meal prep idea, make a bigger batch and enjoy it for a few days. With this on the menu, getting out of bed in the morning has never been more rewarding.

1i89xzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/keurig/comments/1i89xzo/is_a_keurig_kmini_worth_the_investment/,Is a Keurig K-Mini worth the investment?,"I’m a single guy so when I brew coffee, I just need to brew one cup of coffee. So I have two options- small Mr. Coffee machine or pour over brewing cone.

My issue with the Mr. Coffee machine is that it requires cleaning of the carafe and filter holder… just for one small cup of coffee. Very annoying! And the pour over brewing cone, while I admit makes the best tasting coffee, is very tedious where you have to boil water first, pour over the cone and wait for it to slow drip. Very time consuming, tedious process.

So that’s why I’m tempted to buy a K-Mini machine. Just the thought of popping in a k-cup pod and having your coffee ready in a few minutes sounds so convenient and less time consuming. Many people claim they don’t like the taste of k-cup coffee, but I drink them at my job since we have a Keurig machine in the office and I have no issue with the way the coffee tastes.

So what are your thought? Do you think it’s worth the investment to get a Keurig K-Mini machine and give k-cups a try for the convenience?",1,1737656244.0,keurig,3,1.0,False

But my coworker and I seem to have gone to different ones in the courtyard. I showed her the first pic which I took, and she said no she went to the one down the stairs. So I assume she went to the blue arrow, and I went to the pink. I thought maybe the blue was just outdoor seating for the pink, but there was no door to go outside in the pink and blue seems to have its own (limited) indoor seating. Are they 2 different places?? 

Bottom left pic is where I went, I assume bottom right pic is where my coworker went. Both bottom pictures are taken from Google maps and are both under “Original Mosque Kitchen and Cafe” but they each have a menu and a till",9,1737656031.0,Edinburgh,7,0.85,False
