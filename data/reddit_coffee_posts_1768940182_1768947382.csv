Please also don't message unless you meet my criteria. I appreciate kind words and good lucks but it becomes frustrating after a while.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this, more inclined to go higher than lower)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?",1,1768947197.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1qif9jq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1qif9jq/how_im_avoidingsloppy_marketing/,"How I'm avoiding""sloppy"" marketing","Sloppy in this context refers to founders using AI slot to promote their companies.

(and I'm adding the examples below because the automods don't seem to like multiple links)

**1. Content**

Share your proprietary insight or data. Stop publishing what everyone can generate.

As a founder, share a weird bug you fixed last week or a conversation with a customer.

* Data Example: Peter Walker, Head of Insights @ Carta, has 159,221 followers on Linkedin from sharing financial data from Carta in simple infographics.
* Anecdote Example: Chris Pisarski, Co-founder @ Crustdata (YC F24) shares a sales lesson he learned at YC. Relevant to his target audience of tech founders.

**2. Free Tools**

Vibe code a free tool that's useful to your target audience (CLI utilities, calculators, configuration generators) instead of vibe coding content.

It gets word of mouth by providing value and is a great way to capture lead info like email/company info.

* Example: Ahrefs' free SEO mini-tools get users to input their data, analyze metrics, and trust their platform before considering the paid product.

**3. Use Negative Positioning**

Be specific about who you're NOT for.

It can be counter-intuitive, but being violently specific with your messaging helps it resonate and reduces churn. Filtering out bad-fit users early, who will discover dissatisfaction down the road.

* Example: Basecamp explicitly lists features they'll never build and customers they don't want. By saying ""not for big enterprise"" they became heroes for 10-person startups.

**4. Build in Private, not Public**

""Building in Public"" became performance art. With the traditional platforms getting flooded with slop, you have to build the rooms worth being invited into.

Create private Slack/Discord groups with high barriers to entry and create FOMO. Make your customers feel like insiders.

* Example: Figma grew through local designer communities that fostered learning / advocacy. Then entire companies started adopting Figma bottom-up.

**Bonus tip** (you should apply to all 4): Shift from expert to peer.

You earn trust by being real and in the weeds.

Now that everything is perfectly polished with AI, don't be afraid to share what didn't work, an occassional spelling mistake, or maybe even recommend a competitor to a non-ICP.

* Why this works: In 1966, researchers at the University of Texas discovered that highly competent job candidates were deemed more likeable and trustworthy when they ""spilled"" coffee on themselves before the fake interviews. Now called The Pratfall Effect.

then i kinda accidentally figured something out. i had to go work from this library near downtown because my internet was down for a day. got SO much done that day it was weird. so i tried it again the next week just to see and same thing happened.

now i rotate between three spots: the library twice a week, this quiet coffee shop on wednesdays (their wifi is actually decent), and home the other days. something about changing the environment just flips a switch in my brain. like my brain associates each place with focus now instead of being bored of the same desk.

the library is obviously free which is nice cause im trying to keep some money saved up for a trip later, and the coffee shop i usually just get one drink and camp out for like 4 hours lol.",7,1768946942.0,Productivitycafe,3,1.0,False

So my friends and I all play the same sport (it's how we met), and we also play on the same team. There's two teams, team 1 and team 2. We are all on team 2.      Team 1 has a few snobby people which make playing with them uncomfortable and even unbearable at times. 

\*\*\*We paid a good chunk of money to be able to play in the club\*\*\*

(The beginning of this might make you  think I'm being selfish and only thinking about myself, but let me cook lol)

We were supposed to practice today, but our coach ended up moving it to another day, which I cannot make due to class and other personal events I already had planned. So she said we had to either practice with team 1 today, or practice with our own team tomorrow. So obviously, I have to go with the other team to get some practice in. 

So I asked my friends, who I knew would be free during this time to come join me, and all I got was a bunch of no's pretty much. 

Due to our coaches changing schedule, I've ended up practicing alone with team 1 a few times, and it's honestly really difficult always being the odd one out because I make the group uneven, so I end up either sitting out for a drill, or having to do the drill alone, with everyone else watching. My friends know this, as we talk about it a lot. 

So, of course, I practice without anyone again today, and actually ended up sitting out for most of the practice because there wasn't anywhere I could step in, and nobody would let me sub in for them. With all this free time to think, I started to get a bit sad and upset not only at myself, but at my friends.  

I've done so much for all of them, especially off the court to the point where it feels like sacrificing an hour of your time in an uncomfortable environment should be a no- brain trade-off. 

  
I'll give some examples. 

I'm the only one with a car, so if anyone needs to go somewhere, it's through me. 

They want to get coffee or a smoothie, but are low on cash, I'll help them out. 

A concert ended at 11 pm, but it was in a sketchy area, so I went to go pick them up. 

I've never asked for anything in return. Am I asking for too much? It shouldn't be that hard to overcome some uncomfortablility. 

  
I just feel stupid for getting upset over it. ",1,1768946648.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1qif3q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1qif3q0/would_you_just_quit/,would you just quit ?,"hi ! so, i work at a corporate coffee shop with a horrible  work environment. my boss got on my ass every single last thing i did.

to list a few things:

\- not answer the headset right away when i was cashing out someone in the drive thru. also handling making several drinks and getting other miscellaneous food items.

\-  not putting one more scoop of ice in a drink and it looked too low.

\- not cashing people out fast enough to meet our 25 second timer. i was waiting on food and drinks to be made by other employees or managers holding up the line. but, i got blamed because the line wasn’t moving fast enough when it was wrapped around the building. or i counted the change too slow because i didn’t fully comprehend the amount of change fast enough.

\- i was too slow while making drinks, even though i was the only one that could because my coworker burned her hand and could not make coffee. her hand was injured.

i admit i’m not the most  perfect worker and i probably messed up a lot. but, i believe i always tried to improve or make things right to the best of my ability. i feel like i’m the one always being yelled at. none of my other coworkers get yelled at like i do. i’m always the one singled out for some reason. they’re always told in a calm tone what they did and how to improve on it. i literally just have voices raised at me all the time. go faster, be better, you’re always a second behind and you’re holding everyone and everything up. normally i just shrug it off and don’t react at all. i don’t say anything to my managers at all. i rarely even respond. but, my breaking point was two mornings ago.

we had just gotten jelly, which we’ve never had in the store before. i gave a customer jelly for free without charging them because i had no idea we had to charge for it. i thought we could give it out like ketchup. my boss didn’t make a coffee with milk in it, so i almost gave out a mini bottle of milk. just so the couple could get out of the drive thru and put milk in their coffee because my boss is always stressing about the timer. but, we ended up trading it for a new coffee with milk in it. i gave a chocolate milk out that a couple asked for that my coworker didn’t add to the order. i was just yelled at and they made me switch positions with someone. they sent the person on front counter on break. my other coworker got sent home because we were talking and there was nothing else to do. everything was stocked and cleaned, but my boss said find something to do. so i was thinking i could go home on those terms.

i just had enough of being yelled at i couldn’t take it anymore so i just asked to leave. my boss said i couldn’t leave because that’s technically “job abandonment.” but two other coworkers got to go home. she made me sign a job abandonment form and i left. i just didn’t care. i apologised to me coworkers later on.

but, now i’m deciding whether i should put my two weeks in or not. i talked to a manager and she said that i could put my two weeks in as a curtsey. if i do that, i can be listed as a rehire in the network of restaurants the owner has. if i don’t and leave on bad terms, i could be listed as a no rehire. i’m not sure what to do. but, i definitely don’t want to go back there because my boss will make it hell for me.",1,1768946639.0,WhatShouldIDo,2,1.0,False

Manager keeps coming up with new reasons to give me negative feedback. Exit now or fight it? Help negotiating severance!,"I am reposting this because I felt I needed to add more context.   
  
I am a ""Director-level"" employee at a tech startup (acquired by larger company) and I'm in a really difficult situation I've never been in before...Looking for advice on whether to fight a PIP that feels retaliatory or negotiate severance now.

**Background:**

* I put ""director-level"" in quotations because the role pays \~50% of a market salary for this level anywhere else in the country, let alone Boston
* I was hired 6 months ago for a leadership role to build out a partner program (community/influencer management). 
   * I originally applied for a completely different role, more in line with my background, and was asked to take on this role. I now believe it was because they couldn't fill this role, esp at the salary they offered
* My actual background: revenue operations/enablement, GTM strategy, strategic partnerships
* Was hired to ""build a team""; realized in my first week that 2 junior associates were hired the week before me; the only person with institutional knowledge (a manager who participated in my interview process and who I thought would be on my team) was fired in my second week
   * I was immediately handed off all of the managers accounts, and all of my leaders accounts, so was managing a massive portfolio of relationships while simultaneously being asked to build the team infrastructure, and lead 2 brand new associates who were just as new to the org as I was (their first job out of college)
* Manager role was supposed to be backfilled, but that hire was suddenly canceled in December with no explanation
* Consistent positive feedback through early December (30, 60, 90-day reviews all strong)
* Since I knew I was coming into a role I had no experience in, I have been vocal about not quite sure I'm hitting the mark, just not feeling like I am executing to the level I am used to since this isn't my typical domain; my leader always reassuring me I am doing great

**What happened:**

* Dec 4: I share with my leader I am feeling a bit ""burnt out"" and bummed to feel this way given it's only been 6 months, but that I am really looking forward to hiring the manager role for extra support for the team
   * My leader tells me ""you're doing great given the circumstances"" and also expressed excitement for the impending manager hire
* Dec 11: less than a week later, my leader announces team restructuring, and the manager hire I was counting on gets paused (despite a candidate in the final round after 6 months of searching) with no explanation
* Dec 12: I express frustration about the hiring pause and raise concerns about needing more support. I also ask about compensation increase given expanded scope now and with new restructuring plan to add 2 additional associates (based in another region) to my team
* Dec 15: Suddenly told I'm ""not meeting expectations"" for the first time ever - concerns about ""leadership,"" ""judgment,"" and ""strategic thinking""
   * I ask for examples of this, since it comes as a shock and examples shared are vague, subjective, some completely fabricated, some from 5-months ago, etc. all pointing to her looking for examples to dig up to add to this ""feedback"" rather than it being actual indicative of a pattern of poor performance
* Jan 12: Placed on 4-week ""informal PIP"" with behavioral/subjective goals

**The PIP details:**

* Goals are things like ""demonstrate better judgment"" and ""improve team perception of leadership""
* No clear metrics for success
* I ask how to know if I am tracking positively, my leader says ""we won't know if you're meeting expectations until the end of 4-weeks""
* Examples used against me: adding a thumbs-up emoji to a Slack message instead of replying to a thread with a written response; signing off an email to Susan ""Thanks Susan!"", instead of ""Thanks, \[my name\]""; she also gave me the feedback that my team doesn't view me as a leader and when I asked for clarity on how this was determined, she said she asked them randomly in a 1:1 at one point last year who on their team they view demonstrates leadership qualities and they didn't mention my name...I am their actual leader, so not sure it would make sense for them to mention my name given that set up, regardless not sure this deems appropriate context to provide someone with that kind of feedback.
* Every week there are ""new examples"" of me missing the mark, seemingly like she's gone out of her way to find more reasons to say I'm falling below expectations, again when this was never happening up until I pushed back
* My leader has made contradictory mistakes herself but faces no accountability (e.g. as recently as this week she sent internal legal language to an external partner and immediately had to follow up to retract the email; last year I had to ping her multiple times to respond to an email where a partner was asking to meet up for coffee. she finally set the meeting then didn't show up; she also fired off 100s of emails from a CRM automation that were addressed to the wrong person, to which she had to manually follow up to each one apologizing for the ""typo"".)

**HRs involvement:**

* I met with HR early on in the situation since the feedback came as such a shock. 
* Our head of HR sat in a couple calls with me and my leader but made no effort to contradict her or push back on the week feedback examples such as the ""hearsay"" bit about my team not viewing me as a leader
* The HR leader acknowledged the process should be ""collaborative"" but has made no commitments to intervene on subjective measurement, etc.
* The HR leader had advised me to write up a reflection doc on the feedback initially and when I provided this, my leader dismissed it as ""too detailed"" and has pushed me to ""just move forward"" 

**My concerns:**

1. The PIP feels designed to fail (subjective criteria, my leader controls the outcome, the goalposts keep moving)
2. I've documented everything. The timing is clearly retaliatory since I asked for feedback consistently in every 1:1 up until the point I pushed back on a decision and then suddenly received a mountain of feedback I'd never heard before. And the examples are subjective, weak, and not indicative of a pattern; not to mention the contradictory examples of my manager making similar ""mistakes"" and not being held accountable
3. Even if I somehow pass the PIP, I'd still be reporting to this leader which feels like it's generally just not working at this point
4. Every day I stay, it feels she's focused on building more ""evidence"" against me rather than actually helping to further development or set me up to better succeed
5. I just relocated to Boston a few months ago for this job

**My questions/where I am seeking support:**

* It feels like I may need to get out of this company either way. 
* I am not going to want to work for this leader long term at this point as trust has been broken and I don't feel like its something that's being set up to effectively ""come back from""

**So...**

* Do I negotiate severance ASAP? Or just wait it out to see how the PIP ends up?
* Am I crazy to think this is retaliation? I mark on my interview form that I have a disability, but I haven't otherwise brought it up directly so I know it might not fall into that clear cut legal bucket but the timing of trying to push me out after I expressed frustration seems retaliatory. No?
* If I negotiate exit, what leverage do I have? (Just relocated to Boston, suspicious timing, pointing out my leaders contradictory mistakes, etc.?)
   * I am also the only leader in the Boston office, and it's an office full of junior employees who consistently express anxiety over not having a leadership presence (rest of company is located in other geo)
   * Now with the GM gone, I feel it could go either way. They might be more inclined to help ensure I stay or his firing might be indicative that they just simply do not give an eff about anyone, in particular leaders since they've hired and fired 4 (soon to be 5 if you count me) in under a year...every other employee is a 1-2 year out of college grad. 

**Additional context:**

* I have been consulting with a lawyer who suggests the retaliatory piece is based on the timeline and documentation. I am sure I am missing some important context here but they do seem to think I have a case, particularly in that my leader is giving me feedback about minor, silly things like how I respond to an email when she has made much more significant mistakes
* I've documented everything (positive reviews, timeline, contradictory feedback examples, etc.)
* I'm leading a major work trip this week as ""the only leader"" while being told I'm ""missing the mark as a leader"" - example of feeling contradictory and that I'm being set up to fail
   * I asked my leader if this makes sense given her concerns with my performance and she said she ""has confidence I will lead an excellent trip,"" which again is contradictory to the feedback given that I am not performing at a leadership level...

1qiewn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1qiewn9/my_boyfriend_has_multiple_personalities/,My boyfriend has multiple personalities.,"Walking through the heavy glass doors of my apartment, only one thought occupied my mind.

*What personality would my boyfriend have this time?*

When we first met, he was the boy I fell in love with, all wide smiles that reached his eyes and drank me in completely, as if staring straight into my soul. 

The original Kaz had the spirit of a golden retriever stitched into a human body. 

He had jumped out at me in the library while I was searching for a book, towering over me, thick red hair poking out from beneath a baseball cap. Peeking behind a book, he offered me a grin. “Why did the fish cross the road?”

I already knew the answer to the joke. But I found myself smiling. 

Kaz was like this tiny flicker of sunshine illuminating my otherwise mundane day. 

“To get to the other *tide*,” I said, unable to resist a smirk. “Everyone knows that joke.” 

He grinned, raising a brow. “But I got your *attention*, didn't I? Guess I win.”

I stepped back, my chest fluttering. Butterflies. Fuck. An entire swarm of them bleeding through me, twisting my gut. 

I hadn't had this feeling since middle school. I thought I was asexual. I thought I didn't *want* a relationship. 

But this boy— this wide eyed, grinning boy was testing my boundaries. 

My cheeks felt like they were on fire, my hands clammy, my thoughts dancing. 

I found my voice, but I didn't trust it not to shake.  Love was war, and he'd fired the first shot. “I didn't know it was a *competition*,” I said, coolly. 

*Dodged*.

His grin widened. This boy knew what he was doing, perfectly hooding his arrow, the trajectory aimed directly at my heart. Charming, funny, with just a hint of teasing. “Do you wanna go grab a coffee?” 

Score. 

The arrow sliced straight through my right ventricle. No stopping it. 

I was too flustered to pull it out. “There's a coffee shop around the corner,” he continued his assault. This time moving closer, his breath in my ear. Another arrow, this time destroying my pulmonary valve. 

I was in big trouble. 

“How ‘bout it?” 

“Fine,” I said, shooting *him* back.” 

His smile was warm. “I'm Charlie,” he said. “But call me Kaz.” 

Bullseye.

One date, and I fell hard. 

He made me laugh so hard I snorted soda up my nose, and we were kicked out for being too loud. I realized far too early that I loved him. I was serious about him. 

I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. Then, after six months of dating, he… changed.

It was subtle at first. 

Sometimes, he forgot to brush his teeth.

He'd forget my name, insisting on calling me, “Girl.” 

One day, he turned up half dressed, his cheeks pale. 

I asked if he was okay, and he froze. 

His head snapped up, eyes narrowing. 

He’d been restless all evening, tapping his foot, drumming his fingers. 

“Why *wouldn’t* I be okay?” 

His voice was cold, sending ice trickling down my spine. I told him to forget it.

He punched the table, sudden and violent, lunging forward. That was the first time he scared me.

“Why wouldn’t I be okay, huh?” he demanded through clenched teeth. “Fucking tell me. Go on.”

He leaned in, lips curled. Then, just as quickly, he straightened.

“I’m fine.”

He drained his champagne in one gulp, spat it out, and politely excused himself.

The next day, he surprised me, running into me from behind.

“Attack hug!” Kaz laughed, wrapping his arms around me. 

I was still numb from the day before, but I figured it was stress.

A week later, he threw his backpack in my face.

“Don't fucking *talk* to me,” he hissed when I tried to cool him down. We were in class, and his sudden outburst caught eyes. 

I hugged him, and he jolted away from me like he’d been shocked. 

Eyes wide, lips parted. 

“Get *off* me,” he whispered, wrapping his arms around himself.

“Kaz.” I started forward, but he backed away, tears glittering in his eyes. 

“Get the fuck away from me!” He sobbed, falling onto his knees, eyes frenzied, like he was lost. Like he didn't know who I was. 

“Get away! Don't you dare touch me!” We were attracting attention. I heard the whispers. Felt dozens of eyes glued to me. “Abuse”, they whispered, judgmental glares sending prickles through me. 

Even my best friend was in someone else's ear, and I felt like I was hurting him. Just being close to him was sending him into hysterics. I backed away, but the whispers didn't stop. They were louder.  *“He's terrified of her.”*

So, with a numb heart, I left the classroom, breathless.

Later that night, he turned up at my door.

I waited for him; my heart pounding. 

*“What personality would my boyfriend have this time?”*

“Hey, babe,” he smiled warmly, kissing me on the cheek. “You okay?” 

I was done.

“You need a doctor,” I told him gently, my voice trembling. 

I couldn't bring myself to *touch* him.

Kaz inclined his head, lips curling into a smile. “Wait, why?” 

“Because you're not *you*,” I whispered. “The way… the way you're acting,” I held in a breath that was so sharp, splintering my lungs. “You need help, Charlie.” 

He rolled his eyes, but nodded, hugging me.

“I love you,” he whispered in my ear.

An hour later, he threw hot coffee in my face, screaming. 

Kaz’s brain scans were fine. 

He was completely mentally and physically healthy.

Which didn't make sense.

We slept together, as usual, his arms wrapped around me.

But in the middle of the night, he woke me up *screaming*. 

He kicked me, his kicking legs squirming, arms flailing.

“Kaz!” I shrieked. “Kaz, wake up!” 

His eyes flew open, wide and terrified.

His lips parted, stretching wider and wider. 

*“Please,”* Kaz whimpered, the whites of his eyes rolling back.

“Get *us* out of here!”",1,1768946221.0,shortscarystories,0,0.67,False
1qiewgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qiewgr/would_you_just_quit/,would you just quit ?,"hi ! so, i work at a corporate coffee shop with a horrible  work environment. my boss got on my ass every single last thing i did.

to list a few things:

\- not answer the headset right away when i was cashing out someone in the drive thru. also handling making several drinks and getting other miscellaneous food items.

\-  not putting one more scoop of ice in a drink and it looked too low.

\- not cashing people out fast enough to meet our 25 second timer. i was waiting on food and drinks to be made by other employees or managers holding up the line. but, i got blamed because the line wasn’t moving fast enough when it was wrapped around the building. or i counted the change too slow because i didn’t fully comprehend the amount of change fast enough.

\- i was too slow while making drinks, even though i was the only one that could because my coworker burned her hand and could not make coffee. her hand was injured.

i admit i’m not the most  perfect worker and i probably messed up a lot. but, i believe i always tried to improve or make things right to the best of my ability. i feel like i’m the one always being yelled at. none of my other coworkers get yelled at like i do. i’m always the one singled out for some reason. they’re always told in a calm tone what they did and how to improve on it. i literally just have voices raised at me all the time. go faster, be better, you’re always a second behind and you’re holding everyone and everything up. normally i just shrug it off and don’t react at all. i don’t say anything to my managers at all. i rarely even respond. but, my breaking point was two mornings ago.

we had just gotten jelly, which we’ve never had in the store before. i gave a customer jelly for free without charging them because i had no idea we had to charge for it. i thought we could give it out like ketchup. my boss didn’t make a coffee with milk in it, so i almost gave out a mini bottle of milk. just so the couple could get out of the drive thru and put milk in their coffee because my boss is always stressing about the timer. but, we ended up trading it for a new coffee with milk in it. i gave a chocolate milk out that a couple asked for that my coworker didn’t add to the order. i was just yelled at and they made me switch positions with someone. they sent the person on front counter on break. my other coworker got sent home because we were talking and there was nothing else to do. everything was stocked and cleaned, but my boss said find something to do. so i was thinking i could go home on those terms.

i just had enough of being yelled at i couldn’t take it anymore so i just asked to leave. my boss said i couldn’t leave because that’s technically “job abandonment.” but two other coworkers got to go home. she made me sign a job abandonment form and i left. i just didn’t care. i apologised to me coworkers later on.

but, now i’m deciding whether i should put my two weeks in or not. i talked to a manager and she said that i could put my two weeks in as a curtsey. if i do that, i can be listed as a rehire in the network of restaurants the owner has. if i don’t and leave on bad terms, i could be listed as a no rehire. i’m not sure what to do. but, i definitely don’t want to go back there because my boss will make it hell for me.",1,1768946211.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1qiev25,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Level_Work2004/comments/1qiev25/why_senior_care_facilities_keep_failing_at/,Why Senior Care Facilities Keep Failing at Activities (And What's Actually Fixing It),"I need to vent about something that's been bothering me since my mom moved into assisted living: the activities are terrible. And I mean consistently, depressingly terrible.

We're paying $6,500 a month for her care. The activity calendar looks impressive on paper—something scheduled almost every day. But when I visit? She's sitting alone in her room because she ""doesn't want to go to another movie"" or ""bingo is boring.""

Turns out this isn't just my mom's facility. It's a systemic problem across senior care, and the reasons why are actually pretty interesting (and frustrating).

**Why Programming Sucks at Most Facilities**

After talking to activity directors at several communities, here's what I've learned:

**They're impossibly overwhelmed.** One person is typically responsible for programming 60-100+ residents across independent living, assisted living, AND memory care. Different cognitive abilities, different physical capabilities, different interests—all supposed to be served by one overworked, underpaid staff member.

**Budgets are a joke.** Think $2-4 per resident per month for supplies. That's less than a coffee per person. So programming defaults to whatever's free or cheap: movies (Netflix subscription), bingo (can reuse cards), maybe a volunteer musician once a month.

**The training doesn't exist.** Most activity directors have hospitality or recreation backgrounds. They're not trained in dementia care, adaptive movement, or therapeutic programming. They're doing their best with zero specialized education.

**The one-size-fits-all problem.** How do you create activities that work for someone with advanced Alzheimer's AND someone who's cognitively sharp but physically limited AND someone who's fully active? You can't. So everything defaults to the lowest common denominator, which bores everyone.

**The Result? Nobody's Actually Engaged**

My mom's facility does ""chair exercises"" twice a week. I watched once. A staff member stands at the front saying ""reach up high... now reach down low"" while 12 residents sit there barely moving, staring into space. Zero engagement. Zero joy. Just killing time until lunch.

The memory care unit is worse. Residents sit in a circle while staff read the newspaper out loud. Nobody's following the stories. Several are asleep. This costs $8,000 a month.

**What's Actually Working (From What I've Seen)**

Here's where this gets interesting. I visited another facility recently that my aunt is considering, and the difference was shocking.

They had rhythm and percussion classes through something called InstruMix (instrumix.org). Instead of passive sitting, residents were shaking instruments, moving to music, actually smiling and interacting with each other.

The participation rate was wild—maybe 20+ residents actively engaged vs. the usual 6-8 half-asleep people at my mom's place.

I asked the director about it and learned some stuff that makes sense:

**It works across ability levels.** Someone with dementia can shake a tambourine. Someone fully cognitive can challenge themselves with complex rhythms. Same class, different participation levels, everyone actually engaged.

**Rhythm doesn't require verbal processing.** For residents with cognitive impairment, complex instructions are impossible to follow. But rhythm guides movement automatically—the beat tells you what to do. No confusion, no frustration.

**Music accesses preserved memories.** Even advanced Alzheimer's patients often retain musical memory. The activities director said they've had non-verbal residents suddenly start humming along or keeping rhythm.

**It's actually exercise disguised as fun.** Residents who refuse ""chair exercises"" will enthusiastically shake instruments and move to music because it doesn't feel like physical therapy.

**The Business Model Makes Sense**

Here's what surprised me: this isn't staff-led. They bring in certified instructors as independent contractors who specialize in this type of programming.

The facility pays per class (apparently $60-80 depending on location), which is way cheaper than hiring a full-time specialized staff member or bringing in music therapists at $150+ per session.

They schedule 2-3 classes per week, so residents get consistent programming without the facility dealing with payroll, benefits, or training costs.

**Why This Matters Beyond ""Nice Activities""**

The research on social isolation and inactivity in seniors is brutal:

* Isolation increases dementia risk by 50%
* Physical inactivity accelerates decline
* Depression and apathy are rampant in facilities with poor programming
* Family satisfaction (which affects reviews and referrals) directly correlates with activity quality

This isn't just ""keeping grandma busy."" It's genuinely impacting health outcomes and quality of life.

**The Bigger Picture**

What frustrates me is that solutions exist. The research is clear about what works—rhythm-based movement, music engagement, multi-sensory activities. Programs like InstruMix have figured out how to implement this practically and affordably.

But most facilities stick with the same ineffective programming because that's what they've always done, because they don't know alternatives exist, or because changing systems is hard.

Meanwhile residents sit isolated and depressed, families pay thousands monthly for mediocre care, and activity directors burn out trying to do impossible jobs with no resources.

If you're researching facilities for a loved one, ask about their programming. Actually visit during activities and see if residents are genuinely engaged or just killing time. Ask if they bring in specialized instructors or if it's all staff-led basic activities.

The difference between facilities with real programming and those just checking boxes is night and day.

My mom's moving to the facility with the InstruMix classes next month. She's actually excited about the rhythm sessions—first time she's been excited about anything since moving into senior living.

That shouldn't be remarkable, but apparently it is.

I think it's clear that right now running a business is incredibly difficult, in particular because of high rents and wages. Even with rising operational costs they could potentially stay open but people aren't giving them enough business to cover the costs. It feels as though we have lots of places opening up that overestimate our interest in them. My question is, what does your ideal Ballard look like, what is a new place that you would give business to?

We could get into a long discussion about the economics of brick and mortar stores, I don't really want to get too into the weeds right now and potentially start an idealogical debate. So maybe we steer clear of stuff which we as individuals can't change in the short term like tax policy, rising minimum wage, private equity ownership of property. One thing that could be relevant is the new legislation allowing corner stores in residential zoned areas, so you could call out that you want a cafe but specifically as a corner store and not just on market st. 

I want to focus on what we want in our neighborhood as consumers/clients/users/patrons, maybe it's not realistic for one reason or another but what would you want.

1qier9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1qier9u/information/,Information,"I am a newbie, I am only about two months in and I love working out and this subreddit because I learn a lot but also I feel as if I have so much to learn. 

Couple questions cause I’m curious; I saw a comment that unless you’re hitting your protein goals in a day (100g) then working out is useless, true?

Do you stretch before your workout? with two kids ones being a 4 month old I wake up around 5 to be able to dress, coffee, workout, shower before they wake up by 630, at first I did a walk on the treadmill to warm up but it seems I’ll always have to cut rest of my workout short when I do. I haven’t been lately and haven’t felt a difference, is this something I should do to help long term? 

Do you all areas in one day, i.e. arms, abs, glutes all in the same workout or do you rotate? 

Do you work out every day? I seem to shoot for 7 days but will routinely fall short a day whether from kids, grocery shopping at 6am or otherwise but if I go past one day of not working out and hit two days I really struggle to jump back on the track. 

Coffee, energy drink or pre workout?  

Music or podcast? ( this is for my own interest lol) 

Last question is for my girls - do you wash your hair everyday if you workout every day? I put my hair up of course but still it’s sweaty. I’ve always been a wash 2x a week girl now it’s 5/6x.",2,1768945882.0,workout,3,1.0,False

Uno reverse card as when Andre was getting ready, teddie was doing nothing. Chilling on the bed, eating an entire container of cookies made by Liam, cuddling with ringo, hiding in Andre’s hoodie that was becoming not all that big on her. “Cmon bear, ya gotta get ready” he’d been telling her all week, he tried pulling every string to get her out of it but it just didn’t work. She *had* to come, it was just orders, as atlas would say…



T: Do I have toooooooo? Like you know-

A: tried everything

T: fk mannnnnn—hey remember when I fell last week? My ankle is still hurting-

A: they’re going to tell you to strap an ice pack on it and keep walking.

T: What about, wife’s in the hospital? Dumb btch couldn’t control her stress again?

A: don’t call yourself that, thought, they’ll drag you from the ER and to the event. 

T: she’s dead?

A: they’ll bring your gravestone & body.

T: BULLSH!T THERES NO FKING WAY—fk man—you formal people suck-

A: unfortunately that’s just how it is, min dronning.



He gave her a simple cheek kiss,”we won’t be there long, look, we won’t be there any longer than we’re supposed to be. As soon as the reasoning we’re there is complete, we’re gone-“ “and you-“ “yes, I’ll get you ice cream” she giggled to his response. Earning him a full kiss from teddie, she ran both hands through his hair before leaning back and pulling him along with her. They had to get ready so he pulled away from the kiss, signaling to Teddie that yeah, it’s time to get ready, I guess. 



About a half hour later, Andre walked out into the living room to find Teddie, in a simplistic yet stunning red dress. *Red suits you well*, ran through his head. I mean red is a warm color, she had a warm color pallet, and red is warm like the nature she provides. It’s easy to just melt into the moment with her. Teddie was laying on the couch, cuddling with Ringo one last time before leaving. 

“You ready to go?” 

“No, my back hurts” she complained.

He softly chuckled and sat near her on the couch,”I can’t tell if you’re trying to get out of this or if it actually hurts.” 

She groaned in response,”like my back aching is new?” 

He pulled her close, leaning her back towards his chest and placing one of her bangs closest to him behind her ear to give her cheek a kiss. “4 hours tops. We leave as soon as we can, I promise.” 

“You can’t just go?” She pleaded with wide eyes.

“I really tried, love, I did” He sighed,”we don’t have to leave right now…we can chill here for a bit.” 

She lit up for a second,”how long?” 

“You’ve got 30 minutes”

30 minutes was long enough for cuddling and a nap, pulling her boys in close for a minute so she could enjoy their warmth. 

*That damn cat*. Andre didn’t fully *hate* ringo, but I mean the mf fked up his eye—as Thomas said, he looked like a James Bond character—not sure if that’s a compliment or what but regardless this is probably gonna be on his face forever. His dau-son-gummy. Teddie is right, harder to acknowledge gummy as a person than a baby. A person. And she wasn’t wrong when the thought came across as weird. 

He took off her glasses as soon as her felt teddie go still, only small movement of her breathing and allowing her to rest.

*Tonight’s gonna feel like forever…*when is an army event ever quick? When do they ever end? The mission tonight is just get in and get out. Thats all they intend on doing. 



Holding hands in the middle of the car’s console, driving through an, as she sang, winter wonderland. 

“In the meadow we could build a snowman, we pretend he’s a loved one too\~, he’ll say ‘are you married’, we’ll say,’yes man—tied the knot last time we were in town\~’”

Her voice like a bell, a harmony, a serenade. She should stop now so he isn’t distracted from driving, how did people drive to her music without getting fully enamored in her world. She could build a universe with a pen and her voice—*took a pencil to her temple, connected it to her brain—*fk man. There goes the musicals he’s been exposed to again. 

She sang the entire way there, and he could’ve driven back home, and back here, just to hear her all over again. But if anything she should rest. She should be resting, shouldn’t eve- 

“Mannnn who tipped them off?” She whined.

“It’s a high profile *army* event, min dronning, of course they want to catch what the rich people wear. And Teddie’s-“

“Made it pretty fkn public that my husband is the red leader, that I joined the army’s for my boyfriend—do I need a reminder?” 

“Ah I was gonna say, Teddie’s arriving pre-American-football-game-performance and everyone wanted to see her but that works too.”

“Do I…look noticeable?”

*Yes*. She did. So hard to hide the whole army’s know now and it’s a rumor in the public eye. Her coat wasn’t doing much favors for her, if anything I’d just fuel what everyone else was judging her for. But if there’s one thing Andre can’t fk up, it’s fking up a photo.

“When we walk out, flip it.” He smiled.

“Huh?”

“Flip. It.”

“The middle?? To the pap?”

He nodded.

“Do you know what they would say about me? How rude I am? How-“ 

she started overthinking that move so he had to stop her. 

“And who gives a fk? I sure don’t. No one really does. And what do you owe them? Nothing but a middle finger” he got out of the car to open her door and they ran from the car to the entrance, middles pointed in towards the people with all the flashing lights and cameras. The paparazzi catching blurry photos of the couple adorned in red, from his uniform to her dress and hair, they were matching to the T. 15 seconds of hell and overstimulation for teddie. 15 seconds of freezing temperature, for teddie, Andre couldn’t be less affected by the snowy terrain. They entered into pure warmth and a soirée filled with minimal color. You’re here to to represent your army, and your army only

“Look, you say the word and we’re gone” Andre promised.

“I’m ready to go”

“No” he chuckled,”ok not right now-“

That’s when two men approached him. They were higher ups, their outfits showing minimal color but their retired legacy pins showing one worked for the blue army and the other yellow. *If retirees are here, is atlas here too?just another ploy to talk again? I mean if he is here we’re avoiding him at all costs.* They said nothing of interest, just a congratulations for everything that happened at reevaluations. 

“You know, sometime in march there’s a training camp running for a few weeks, focusing on hand-to-hand. Last I checked you weren’t that great in that department right, Andre?” The one with the blue pin asked.

“…hm? Yes but-“

“March? Aww man” Teddie interrupted him,” march is by the time I’m due. It’d be a shame if he wasn’t around..” she could already sense they were gonna try and pressure him to sign up. All these people were salesmen anyway.

“Does he really need to be there?” Blue pin asked her?

*“Does he really need to be there?”* She shot back.

“Well, it was just an idea” the yellow pin ended the conversation.

Interlocking arms,”you’ve conned them” he playfully teased.

“You owe me\~” she threw back.



Andre looked around the room in hopes of not spotting his father, *so far in the clear,* tonight was already feeling…off to him. Too much of it felt familiar her just couldn’t put his fin-

“*Hamilton’s skill with a quill is undeniable—but what do we have in common???”* Oh god oh geez Liam please don-

*“we reliable with the LADIESSSSS!”* Well, his wife found his brother. They were like magnets—fk Marco Polo these two could quote musicals all day to find each other. First time teddie had a sort of energy in her tonight as she ran up to hug him. Before a waitress passed by and 

“*THERE ARE SO MANY TO DE-FLOW-AAAA—LADIESSSSS LOOKS PROXIMITY TO POWAAAAA”* and the waitress was visibly flustered by the compliment. These two created a scene like no other—this could quite possibly rival that one time they started singing at the dinner. 

“*LADIESSSSS—*oh they delighted and distracted him, Martha Washington named her feral tawm cat after him-“

“That’s true”

Please teach about American history more—he just had to roll with the theatre kid punches, watching Teddie and Liam reunite after 2 whole days of not singing in each other’s faces. 

Andre pulled out a chair at a nearby table

”oh with the formalities, you’re such a gentleman” she smiled while shaking her head. 

Andre and Liam sandwiched teddie in terms of sitting down. 

“So where’s cc?” She asked, which like, yeah where’s the arm candy you love to show off so much?

Liam leaned just a bit over the counter and playfully sung “*amorrrr\~?*”

Cc turned his head. In terms of staff and uniforms this man was allergic to any color that wasn’t black or white. Yet tonight the most color he wore was a red bow tie. He made his way over to the trio to make it an official group. 

“He looks so handsome, doesn’t he?” Liam loosened *his husband’s—*and he won’t let you forget that—bow tie. 

“Hi zooble” Teddie giggled

“Will you two ever drop that?” He joked

“When you stop being a grumpy bartender who likes to tear everyone to shreds.” Liam bit his lip—*he’s down bad-*

“Zooble would come up with silly nicknames for everyone they way cc does—wait you’re even wearing gangle!” Oh the way teddies brain just clicked everything’s a reference.

Cc looked down and saw the assimilation to the ribbon character and shot a lovingly lethal glare towards his husband, who gave him the biggest grin. If there’s one thing these two do way to often it’s set others up to walk straight into their inside jokes.



The greatest part about them? It’s not at anyone’s expense. No one hates themselves over these jokes. What’s the worst the word ‘zooble’ is gonna do to your perception of yourself. It was nothing near the likeness of ‘mutt’. All the theatre kids would call him is ‘Jax’ though Liam often referred to it more as ‘jaxie-boy’ in his best teddie impression. 

“So it this the bar scene—knew I shoulda worn my suit instead.” Teddie, don’t start with the regrets.

“Then you would’ve needed Andre to match with you.” 

“Would you had matched with me?” She leans in a little closer to ask him.

“Do you think that they would’ve let the *red leaders wife* wear pants?”

“I hate it here—why so old timey?”

“Just how it is” huh, interesting. He hated those words. It was like conforming to something you know is wrong. She told him that all the time, especially when it came to her health, always pissed him off because of the ‘*what if’* of it all. Women in general are dismissed, let it be the army’s or healthcare. 



“Let me get a whisky sour, im so tired of conversation” Thomas cut the room between Teddie and Andre. 

“Coming right up”

“Damn no please at least-“ Liam jumped right in, ruined his precious flirting as if he was still trying to bag cc-

“He’s a *bartender*, its his *job*, it’s what he’s being *paid for*”

They exchanged glances like the army’s about to find out who’s stronger, a wendigo or a monster.

“Please” he added begrudgingly. Being handed his drink he added a,”thanks bazooble” 

“Wow a TADC reference?????”

“From THOMAS!?”

“Evil Jax watching Tommy replace him in all the family photo alb-“

Both faces light up, they’ve got an idea, a horrible just god awful idea. They’re scheming again—OFFICER ITS THESE TWO-ITS THEM-

Andre rather be surprised by whatever these two come up with than watch them plot to burn the world down in real time. He catches up to Thomas and they stand beside the ballroom, watching the sea of yellow, red, green, blue, and black uniforms do whatever it is that they’re doing. 

“Need a drink?” Tom offered his glass.

“Don’t drink at all” Andre shook his head and passed on the glass. 

“I don’t blame you as long as *she’s* in the vicinity. But you shouldn’t let her and her actions dictate your entire life” 

“Oh here we go with the ‘*great moments with Thomas soapes*’”

“I’m serious…tonight feels…familiar”, It felt like his debut, his engagement party, the night—“might just have to give a drunken batshtfaced speech that’ll piss off asslass”

Both men chuckled, and Thomas threw one back.

“Ya know, I haven’t seen Max-“

“Made sure he couldn’t come, if you catch my drift”

“Oh Thomas, only you could avoid all your problems with smooshing-“

“*Smooshing*?”

*Ah crap I’m not reading on Reddit-*

“Teddies been learning how to censor herself-“

“If I put a UV light on the both of you the amount of traces id see with the both of you on eachother-“ he gagged.

His best friend was in love with his sister. As that silly bubble thingy would say *‘disgusting!’* Atleast he was down bad in a good way. He wouldn’t be the kinda man to beat her to a pulp for calling him sweet. Or the kind to cross boundaries because he couldn’t keep it in his pants. He looked at his sister the way his moms looked at eachother, the way Alice looked Steph. 

“If I ever, *ever*, talk about someone the way you talk about my sister. Put me down. As many bullets as you need til I go out. How much you two are obsessed with eachother is truly nauseating” he needed a bit more of alcohol to get through it. 

He looked over to see Andre genuinely lost in thought. Looking over to his blurred direction was teddie and Liam giggling, though he already knew his gaze was hyper fixated on the redhead. Gotta pull him out of it. 

“You know…between you and all your brothers, and I know you the best, you’re gonna be a horrible father.”

“What?” He snapped out of it, ragebait worked. 

“I’m sure my mama, my mom, Travis, Hunter, and Teddie a million times over has told you how great a dad you’re gonna be. I gotta pull the confidence down, can’t get ahead of yourself” 

“Oh Thomas, what would I do without you?”

“Life would go to sht”



Teddie and Liam continued with their own language in a whole nother universe, til:



“Akevitt” Norski accent cut through the conversation. “Ah well if it isn’t nice to see you Teddie”

“Hi Andy, still playing with buzz lightyear?” She smiled, silly one that Teddie.

“Ah I think I’ve got something better to play with” he leaned in closer, barely any space between them. Teddie tried to back away, just being saved by Andy’s drink being served.

She let out a sigh of relief as a thanks to the bartender. He took a swig before trying another pick up line, this was all in the hopes she’d end up falling before resorting. 

“You know…I could show you a real ball\~” he kissed her gloved hand. She turned back to mouth ‘why I wear gloves’ to the bartender and his husband.

“Like a basketball? Or a football—wait no don’t remind me of football I’ve been reminded enough of it-“ always off track, that mind of hers.

“Nah I could show you a better time than this\~ you know what you missed out on during the cotillion” 

She deadpanned him.

“*Andy never recovered, and Teddie went*  *q u i c k*” she got up and shifted seats to…well anywhere that wasn’t near Andrew.

“Isn’t it kinda fked up to quote *that* part of the song” Liam looked at her with a sort of fear—that was abt hammy mom like damn-

Andy ended up leaving, meeting someone else. 

“You don’t think he was trying to flirt? I mean it was bad, but-“ 

“Reddit says no one wants a woman with cross-code contamination”

Just then Ayla walked up, in a gorgeous green dress. Wasn’t any bright obnoxious green it was more a nature, matcha, muted tone, only ruined by the mandatory uniform coat.

“Well, Teddie, General Williams, isn’t it nice to see you two”

Liam offered nothing more than a side eye when seeing two drinks in her hand. *I’m sorry where’d you get that from, wasn’t from his husband? He. Dont. Want. It.* He only consumes his cuddlebear’s handcrafted drinks.

Ayla extends a drink to teddie,”thought you like hated me or smth-“ she quizzed the ex.

“Oh that reevaluations stuff, not our beef, me and Andrias’ problems. I don’t see why that has to get between us” 

They *clinked* their glasses before taking a sip. 

“Good Phil-philos-sloppy-uh philosopp-good thinking” Teddie stuttered.

“Well hope you enjoy your night” Ayla dismissed herself. 

“Excuse me? You drink from not my husband?”

“He only serves *alcohol*\-Andre won’t let me drink *coffee*, what makes you think he’ll allow me a swig of *a l c o h o l????*”

“Fai- the hell you doing back?”

Andrew returned with a plate of cake.

“Wowwwww, What’s with all the peace offerings?” Teddie asked, if she had a nickel for every consumable she’d been offered tonight, she’d have two nickels, which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice.

“Was gonna eat it but then remembered you’re-“

“Please don’t finish that sentence, thank you” she took the plate from his hands. Call her grubby.



Andy felt a bit disrespected by the woman. He walked away, not without throwing a glare in her direction one last time. 

“You trust it?”

“It’s food, when has food ever hurt anyone?”  

“Look bear, i don’t know, I wouldn’t trust it if I were you-“

“Ok if someone else brings me food, it’s a sign that it’s safe.”

They waited all of 5 seconds before Alice approached with a cupcake,”well don’t you look stunning?” 

“Thank you! Yourself included” 

Alice’s outfit wasn’t much, but the pins she wore sparkled very nice on her sleeve. Yellow looked good on her. 

“Got you the last one.” Alice advertised 

“A true lifesaver sis, thank you!” Teddie took the cuppycake from her sister’s hands and licked a bit of frosting off the top. Reminded her husband would steal it she looked over both shoulders, he’s still with Tommy…and now Travis I guess. 

“What are you discussing?” She made the fatal mistake of asking the theatre kids.

“The 10 duel commandments.” Teddie cut.

*“Number one!:”*

*“The challenge, demand satisfaction, if they apologize no need for further action”*

she regrets ever asking.



Travis joined the wall trying to scope out if Bodie had attended. Ever since Andre had told him about…*the situation…*a thought that had plagued his mind:

“Would you have done the same if you & teddie ended up in *that* situation?”

“Ohhhh it’s feeling familiar to you too? Are you-“ 

“Don’t say it” Andre elbowed Tom.

“*Do you get Déjà vu? Hm? Do you get Déjà vu? strawberry ice-*“ Thomas’ Teddie impression was short lived as Andre decided to answer his brother’s question.

“What situation?”

“The whole wedlock situation andrias…would you had gone through with it if it was teddie?”

Andre took a good inhale and let out a chuckle. He couldn’t be more tired of the idea, the constant overlap pissed him off and that was his own brain subjecting him to the torture of comparing the two women. 

“Well, teddie & I had some very clear boundaries. Boundaries we both *mutually* respected. We took *time* and *patience*. The *boundaries* she had set up would’ve prevented us from ending up in such a situation.”

“*What if* one of you slipped up?”

“I don’t think it would get there. She’s not like that. She’s not *forceful.* So the answer is to your question is no, because it’s not in the realm of possibility that it ever could’ve occurred. I did it *right*. I made sure I was *married* before ever moving along that base. Marriage shouldn’t be a necessity by force because it looks better. *And* a child generally shouldn’t be introduced into a relationship until the relationship is stable enough to sustain such change.”



Teddie excused herself to get away from the conversation happening in the main room. Too loud in there. The room was dimly lit so to add a bit more comfort to ease her mind she turned on the light up kinger figurine on her bag. Just made her feel a little easier even with such a weak light. 

“Alone?” Emerging from the shadows was Andrew. 

“I’m not in the mood” she groaned.

“I could make you in the mood” he flirted. Felt more like a threat.

“I’m a married woman, Andy when will you give it a rest?” Body felt heavy, eyes felt such too. 

“I could-“ he grabbed her arm, she immediately reacted pushing him and learning to suck it up and just put up with the room rather than Andrew.



Being subjected to such conversation he decided to return to Teddie and Liam after Alice made her exit. He lightly placed his hand on Teddie’s shoulder, and it felt like relief. 

“You holding up alright?” He asked her.

“Can we go outside?” She countered.

He helped her up and out of her chair, interlocked arms, and he escorted her towards the back of the event venue. 



“Oh you need a coat” he took off his uniform’s jacket to place it over her shoulders,”take mine.”

“You did that on purpose” she teased, pulling the coat in for a bit more warmth,”I’m not complaining…it was just…really hot in there.”

“Ah may have just been me, darling.”

He dusted off a bit of snow from a bench near a rose bush, giving his wife a place to rest. Shouldn’t be on her feet long. They took a seat, and Teddie rested her head on Andre’s shoulder, watching the ballroom as conversation and so much more happened inside. They *had* to be there?

“We’re gonna have to take gummy to these kinda things?” She believed she was thinking to herself.

“I mean, yeah, but not for a while from now…nothing to worry about as of *right now*” he reassured his wife.

“I hate these things—I feel bad knowing they’re gonna be subjected to such torture”

“I’ll give em as many passes as I can try but hey, it’s all a part of the game”

She let out a breath, cold air showed the cold puff coming from such a move. 

“I’m tired…”

“No more than 2 hours left, love, look I promise” he took her hand, giving it a kiss like it was sealing that promise. “You can set a timer, as soon as it goes off? We’re out.”

She followed suit and set a timer for 2 hours on her phone, Andre couldn’t help but admire the rosebushes that surrounded them. Such a pretty sight as the courtyard was covered in the blanket of white, the red roses being a beautiful pop of color. 

It was a silly idea but teddie got up, sat down on the ground, maneuvering just enough to where she’s not *touching* the snow. And made a mini snowman, using the pebbles for eyes. 

“And what are you doing?” He playfully asked her.

“Snowman.” She simplistically answered.

“What’s his name?”

“Snowman”

She motioned for his hand, asking him to help her get up. She plucked a little rose from the bush and gave it to the snowman. She’s been out long enough,”we can go back now”

“You sure?”

She simply hummed and they made their way back in. 



He didn’t want her to just be moping and waiting it out for the time being, so instead he offered to dance. He dusted off the knowledge of what she taught him about formally ballroom dancing at the cotillion to impress her. As if she wasn’t already impressed enough with the man she married. She fell hard for him, resting again on his shoulder as they took its slow. Swaying across the floor at a pace, though, wouldn’t be T-e-double d-i-e if she didn’t sing.

“*I’ve rejected all affections for years and years, I have it now and damnit it’s kinda weird, he tells me ‘I’m pretty’, dunno how to respond I tell him that ‘he’s pretty too’, can I say that?????? Don’t have a clue\~*” The slow dancing felt like a sigh of relief, a homestretch if you will. We’re almost out of here… maybe it’s the quite possible fact that everyone in here may want him dead. Hell reevaluations was proof enough, no one have a fk, but her…or maybe it was the uncertainty of his father being present. Christmas don’t go well for us, he’s probably pissed…or maybe it’s just because this mirrored the worst night of his life. Debut. Whatever the case was Andre could feel this sense of…unease. 

*Something’s wrong…*

*“I blink a suddenly I’ve got a valentine\~”*

Should unease come with her voice—yes—and no—*if it’s that one song about running then yes*—but she was singing about loving him. Maybe everything’s fine…

He allowed himself to ease up into the dance, with every harmony she created, it was sorta his comfort now…

*“You’ll be the last one, I ever kiss, the only guy that I’d, ever miss—oh sht maybe I should run, not even 21, I barely even know who I want to-“*

The sound of bullets broke through the glass windows that acted like walls. Bodies were dropping immediately. He immediately attempted to create some sort of human shield out of himself for teddie. Glass finally hitting the floor and we all were retaught the lesson: *Thomas Soapes, loves his job*. At the first gunshot, the man morphed into a whole nother creature. Ready to step into a line of protection—nah Tom did it for the love of the game, to watch as people fear him. Fending off some of the attackers befo—



***BANG*** 



*Well…are we dead? …the world went completely black…*



*“Big Bear? Sht, your arm!”* You could hear her struggle to lift him up.

*~~“Ted, Deal with it in a safer area, cmon-“~~* 



*More gunshots*



Andre woke up in a supply room of sorts, where they kept documents and other things like that. By his side was the explosives, Tn’T, worried about his current medical condition.

“Hon? You all good?” 

She was one of the 1/2 people in the world that didn’t have to be converted to care about his safety. 

“Need ya to get up” 

She was applying pressure to his arm, now adorned in bullets, with some towel. 

Andre’s biggest concern was whether or not she was hurt, even if he was a bit out of it, Teddie wouldn’t know if she was hurt. 



Checking her body for any injury created an opposing force to her care. She moved his hand a few times, wasn’t till he tried to get up, which was a struggle in and of itself, that she finally snapped.

“ fk Andrias! I’m fine! You *don’t* need to worry abt me all the *goddamn* time, you’re *actually* injured! So*let me, help you*.”

Andre’s learned better not to care abt himself, most times she was his priority, he can’t risk losing her. But then again, she has quite a stern tone.

 Dunno where she found that towel but, she took off the red ribbon tied around her wrist and tied the ribbon tight enough to hold and stop the bleeding. 

Though she was pissed, she loves him, and after knotting that bow, kissed the wound, then his hand. 

*They can’t stay mad at each other long.*

“Guys this is fking disgusting, please stop.” Thomas intervened, no longer the man eating monster and now js a guy forced to watch his best friend and sister debate abt fking again, essentially. 

Andre got up slowly this time, teddie sitting beside him as they devised a plan.

“No clue on who?” Andre asked, best they found out the *who* first, so they can get to the *why*.

“Nah, best guess? Smth about rich folks…or that sht at reevaluations-“

How he hoped it had nothing to do with that, that meant teddie would be a main target. I mean, *himself too*, but she’s at disadvantage—severely unfair.



Admist the deeper conversation on how to get out, Someone else has the idea to hide here too. The rattling of the door has no indication of an ally or enemy, the best they could do was prepare to fight. The door opened, Andre reached for his gun, Teddie had her blades drawn and prepared, and Thomas had shaped his hands into a death trap—essentially his fork and knife. The door opened to, silly ass Travis followed by Cody?

“Fk man we linebacked here! Does the Americans understand that joke?” Cody attempted to save their lives.

“Plenty” Tom responded to it like more of a threat

“Andre! You’re here!” Travis said with relief. Short lived by him realizing his injury, quite literally tied up with a bow, by his wife. Teddie may look innocent but *is she to be trusted*? Also of note was that even if it was slight, Andre was just a few inches in front of Teddie, ready to take more bullets for her if it meant she was safe. 

The group agreed to make it to the garage, making their way out of the documents room and far, far down into the garage where car were parked. 



Opening the door the air was quiet…

Should’ve been filled with chaos but it was quiet…

*Too quiet…* 

Making their way through, teddie noticed another piece of ribbon on the floor, thinner than the one on Andre. Which lead her to just blurt out of nowhere:

“*Here comes the general!”*

*“And his right hand man*!”



Could’ve gotten Liam killed, but then again, lyrics were like Marco Polo to the theatre kids. He perked up from his hiding spot and Teddie ran up to him, giving him a big hug. Could these two survive without eachother?????? Idk it was js a thought—

(Also cOmPlEtElY forgot this smol little detail earlier but Liam’s supposed to have a slight limp to his walk…so uh…yeh now it’s in ur brain and *i totally wrote that detail earlier you js weren’t reading hard enough /j*)

She helped the husbands out of their spot and quickly reve-

*Someone else came around the corner,* immediately starting firing at the sight of red uniforms. And all they could do was run, ofc Thomas damn near wiped out the dude but they were like ants, js fkn multiplying-

Liam was slow with his running, wasn’t his fault, he had a limp. Cc and Teddie slowed down to help, they were right there when it all happened. Killed Andre on the inside to be ahead of her, then hope kinda flickered as Thomas quit on trying to squash the ants and more so just get to safety, telling Teddie that he’d help Liam, as long as she got ahead. She ended up finding a room for them to hide in, gunshots still blaring as she held the door open to make sure everyone got inside. Blades ready just in case it was anyone that didn’t have good intentions. 



Someone yelled about getting to safety, Andre couldn’t distinct who though, tonight felt like that night, running was a struggle because he could almost look back and see his mothers last moments. On the ground. Struggling. Bloodsoaked…

Travis shot back, andre finally snapping out of it, joined him. Efforts short lived as someone came charging with a blade just behind Thomas, cc, and Liam. Though teddie was able to get one of her smaller blades in the man’s shoulder before the trio hit inside. 

*The man being in range of teddie was close enough for Andre,* when it comes to hand to hand fighters it feels more lethal. As long as one can get a hit on the other, you’re close enough in range to get a hit too. And that was too much for Andre, unfortunately he married someone skilled in hand to hand, hand to eye coordinations, even if she wore glasses she wasn’t someone you’d wanna fk with hand to hand. But she’s at clear disadvantage with a hitbox bigger than she normally was. 

Holding the door shut just as Thomas, liam, and cc flopped in. Teddie and Andre struggled to hold the door shut, so Thomas and Travis had to join them.

“Open up\~”

You could hear him cutting the wood of the door with his blade.

“I just want to play\~”

He was fking whispering like it was a smash session, like this was turning someone on. Again, piercing their only line of defense right now. 

“Or we could make this real easy and just hand over red.”

Which one?

“Hand. Over. Red.”

….pure silence as they all held their breath…Teddie squeezing Andre’s hand as a lifeline

“No?”

….

“Maybe next time.”

*Deep exhale* 

They gave it awhile before backing from the door, checking for injuries and recouping the plan. 

Something was off after backing away though. Andre noticed that every hole in that door had blood dripping from it. He looked over at Travis, maybe it was him? Trav had sustained no more than a mere nick of a bulled that wasn’t all that serious. Shitty aim.

Thomas? I mean not much to worry about but the man seemed fine. Almost fking invincible-

He looked over to the last one holding the door, she was quite diplomatic for doing so to, but she seemed fine, thought decked out in a fking red dress. 

He approached her praying it wasn’t her. Then he moved her hair slightly to the side to find a stab wound just millimeters away from her. God. Damn. Spine.

Sending chills down his. 



“Fk Ted-“

Teddie felt a flutter in her tummy, is now the time?

Immediately, panic ran through his body. His hands trembled, her blood on his hands…quite literally. 

Maybe it was poetic, like in movies when they have that symbolic moment telling you how it’s gonna end…Teddie was the stand in for his mom.

“Big bear? What’s going on?” She could feel the pressure of his hands on her neck.

*Teddie would end up like his mom.* 

But was he gonna let himself be taken in the name of safety? 

*He could already see it,* her lifeless body. Blood deeping the color of her red dress. Bringing it to more of a burgundy? Another one lost in a raid that would take more lives in the name of war. 

“Dre seriously, what’s the problem?”

*And could he forgive himself?*

She didn’t wanna be here, complained all week about it. Tried til the very last minute to get out of it and yet here she is, got injured for doing her job. 

*Her job.* 

*He seriously let this be his fking wife’s job?* 

*“*Andre*?”*

the memory of his mother and the current reality of his wife being within his presence were starting to blur.

*“Andre?”*

He could hear the both of them, voices blending together, though they couldn’t be or sound any more different.

Someone you’re supposed to be so in love with you allow them in a world, allow them to take a place where they could lose their life. 

Nah. 

*Where they could fking die?*

“Andre, what’s going on?” You can hear the panic rising in her voice.

How can you say you love this person if you’re not even protecting them?

He held as much as he could, bare hands, what he could think of in the midst of every other thought plaguing his brain. When Thomas finally noticed and stepped in, taking off his tie and holding the wound near her shoulder.

*Why didn’t he think of that?*

All the while teddie was absolutely clueless. He just had to care about someone who had pain delay? *YES!* Ofc he did she is absolutely fking perfect for him, to him. Only person with the possibility to change his mind, not to be pushy, not to be submissive. She had the checks to his balances. 

Teddie finally felt the effects, letting out a sharp inhale, and reaching for her lower back, just to feeling a warm substance oozing from where the pain was radiating. 

“Don’t panic” he tried to reassure her, he was doing the panicking for the both of them,”lower yourself slowly, there’s two more though.”

“The fu-“ she damn near squeaked in terror, Thomas tightened his tie with a double knot effectively stopping the bleeding coming from her shoulder. Lowering herself slowly to her knees, with both men meeting her speed. No rush here.

Liam undid his own tie as a donation to help to the cause, though it could help the neck wound they still need to get that lower back. 

*Too fking close to his child that’s for one.*



Taking off his own belt as it could wrap around her waist, the clinking unfortunately drawing attention. Like he wanted any at all. 

“Oh god, mutt keep it in your-“ 

“fk off Cody—god damnit!” Andre practically barked, pure anger was in his voice.

Teddie let out a hitched sigh, or chuckle, it wasn’t easy to distinguish. It caught his attention, sending him into more of a panic. Teddies hand resting on her side. Fk was it another injury?

”something wrong?” That was as calm as he could muster up. His mind racing at a million miles a minute. Her history? Cramps could mean stress—ofc this was fking stressful. Could it be sending her into early labor—he’d read about that not too long ago. Could it-

“No” she smiled,” no.”

“What’s going on?” He could fking vomit right now with all the stress he felt under. *Fucking nauseous as hell.* 

She gave him a look, yes reassuring but what the he—

*‘Gummy recognizes sounds’*

*‘Sounds?’*

*‘My singing, Liam’s laugh, your cussing-‘*

His cussing, embarrassing, a bit disappointed, but hey*, it was his.*

He let out a soft chuckle, *it was his*, and they’re ok. Pure bliss between the lovers as he tightened his belt around her lower back til the bleeding would stop and finally getting to that neck injury. 



Feeling better to an extent he allowed teddie to have a breather. They all could have a fking breather. Liam and cc cuddled up with each other, their whispering was ineligible but it was relieving whatever tension that arose. “I thought this was what we didn’t want?”

“It’s systemic, not parental, and it doesn’t follow us home.”

“They’ll be ok?”

*“They’ll be ok.”*

That was all you could hear from them. 

“So what was your plan again?” Liam picked back up the hallway conversation.

“To summarize:-” Andre was interrupted.

“We’re going to Chesapeake bay.” The one to do so was teddie, if anyone else did it he’d probably be pissed. All he could do was blush.

“*That* far?” 

The conversation drowned out, Travis being in his own head as he watched his brother. Had he ever seen him in such a…soft state? Teddie was in his arms and he held her like glass. He was *making sure*she rested. *Making sure* she got a break. Not an offer, *he made sure of it.* Why? How? It’s fking impossible to wrap his head around. The training idiot, the loud one, the stupid one, she probably has ulterior motives, she-



The clunk of boots passed by the door. 



The silence was deafening.

…

Everyone held their breath. 

….

*ring ring, ring ring*



Who the hell was that?



The panic visibly overtaking teddies face as she tried to stop it. Their time here should’ve been up. They should be going now. That was what the timer was for. But it was too late. Someone bashed the doors handle and it opened with ease.

Thomas once again took form, where it pained Lewis it was second nature for Thomas. He was ready to rip through these fkers while everyone made a break for it. 



Running away while someone tries to protect has to be the most helpless you could feel. Though he knew Tom would most likely be ok, he still felt an ounce of-

*Sht!*

Losing balance, Andre could hear a bone cracking underneath his foot. He’d tripped over another lifeless body’s arm on the ground. One in a red uniform. One of his own. He didn’t want to feel it but a sharp pain shot through his foot, and the footsteps approaching him got louder. 

Trying to reach for his gun in such a panic he wasn’t able to pull it out in time.

He’s fked.

Prepared for his last moments, going out the way his mother did. 

*Protecting his child.*

*His family.*

*The one he wouldn’t get to meet.*

*To see.*

Our chemistry is great. He’s funny, sweet, and patient. He cooks for me. I cook for him. We cuddle and watch movies at his place. We laugh and we share stories. Because of some physical issues I’ve had with bottoming, we haven't had full intercourse yet, but he has been supportive and willing to wait, even switching roles to make me comfortable. He would say nice things that I taste good and that he is looking forward to do it with me. Last time we met, he bottomed for me and I was surprised. 

However, I’m hitting a wall with trust. He is very discreet (post-marriage closeted) and refuses to be seen with any gay in public but I haven’t asked if he’s open to go for a simple coffee. He also admitted he’s still on the apps, though he says he wants to stop. He also said that I’m the only guy he’s bringing home but I don’t know if I can fully trust that. 

Lately, his texting has dropped off. The ""good morning/night"" messages are gone, and while some friends say he’s just ""settled"" into the relationship, I can't help but feel like he’s keeping his options open. I find it hard to be vulnerable, and I’m wondering if I’m overthinking a natural shift in communication or if his need for secrecy is a permanent barrier to the connection I want. Or maybe I don’t recognize that he actually likes me? ",2,1768945574.0,askgaybros,4,1.0,False

I have not seen this one.,"My wife is a residential interior designer, and she got this request through her website. It was an odd request - asking her to style a house that was purchased before they move in, with furniture that they had already ordered. It's really not what she does, but hey money is money and in this economy you take what you can get. She responded asking for more detail, and the response came back VERY scammy. See below (redacted for privacy): 

Hello \[willmona wife\],  


Glad to read from  you as discussed. I would have loved to call you but I'm hearing impaired so phone conversation will not be good and I guarantee you asked me anything here on Email or sent me a text message on my cell (US number) and will not hesitate to respond back to you without any delay.  


Here are the things you need to figure out. We are in the process of relocating to 3 bed, 2.5 bath, 2,040sqft, \[address redacted\], Brooklyn, NY 11229 | Single family home.  


We have ordered our furniture, new home appliances, some household items and we are in need of a professional to utilize the supplies to style & decorate our new home. That is furniture & electronic layout, artwork placement etc once the orders are delivered. Basically, we want the house arranged and moved in ready before our arrival on the day February 10th,2026.  


I work based on the development and counseling of the deaf people in the community! I am married and have two amazing boys. My husband is a Software Developer.  


To make your work easier and deliverable within the time frame, we have contracted an agency already, the agency will be responsible for hiring an electrician, audio installer and a handyman who can mount drapery hardware etc. They will also be providing movers that will assist in the placement of all furniture so that you can concentrate on the creative styling of the house.  


I don't have pictures of all the ordered items right now, but here's the list:(hope it helps)  
  
Belmont Twelve Light Chandelier - 2  


Curtain Panels  
Floor Pillow - 2  
Mattresses - 4  
Window treatments  
Rug for living room 8' by 10' in size - 1  
Collage wall hanging picture frame - 2  
Traverse Semi-Flush Ceiling Fans - Brushed Steel  
Maroneia TV Stand - 1  
3 Piece Coffee Table Set - 1  
Chair and Ottoman Set - 1  
5 Piece Dining Set - 1  
Diamond Upholstery Panel Bed - 4  
Duvet Set - 4  
2 Complete Bath Rug Set  
Cookware Sets  
Bath linens and mirrors  
  
You will be styling the whole house! The paintings will be done so you need not worry. All the items you will be working with will come at once, no multiple deliveries. The movers will assist in the lifting and placement of all furniture so that you can just concentrate on the creative - styling, you will just need to direct them appropriately.  
  
The expected delivery date is tentative for the week of February 5th,2026.  
  
Do you charge by hour or per project? Give us an estimate of cost and let us know if you accept certified checks for payment.    
  
Kindly, let us know how best to proceed.

1qiekgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HyperemesisGravidarum/comments/1qiekgk/i_need_advice/,I need advice,"So I have severe emetophobia (I've gone to the ER for panic attacks caused by nausea, but it's a bit better now) and I had mild HG in my first pregnancy. I'm not sure how bad it would have been had I not started managing it so early on. The only thing that allowed me to function was 8 mg zofran 3 times a day with magnesium once a day for the constipation. I was still terribly nauseous, but I could at least keep food down and somewhat function. B6+unisom did nothing. 

  
I just found out I'm pregnant again (almost 5 weeks), and I told my doctor that I want a prescription for zofran preemptively, just in case I have HG again. He said that they don't prescribe zofran this early anymore and prescribed Reglan because it ""works better and has less side effects."" Everything I've read says otherwise. I'm prone to panic attacks and even coffee is a strong enough stimulant to cause a panic attack that would require ativan (while not pregnant of course). I also know that Reglan increases stomach dumping, but my nausea was so much worse on an empty stomach. 

  
So, I'm terrified of the Reglan. At this point, I'm worried that the anxiety about taking it while already nauseous will just cause me to spiral the first time I try it. I'm starting with b6 and unisom as a preventative and hoping that the nausea is more bearable this time, but I just need a plan.

Can anyone tell me their experience with Reglan? Especially if you are prone to panic attacks or empty stomachs typically made nausea worse?

Should I just call the ob back, give my reasoning, and insist on zofran? My nausea last time started at 6 weeks so I just want to figure this out.

1qiek85,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1qiek85/how_to_fix_microbiome/,How to fix microbiome,"Recently, I realized that a lot of issues I've been having may be related to gut issues. The main ones being oral thrush, body odor, gas, and occasionally dry skin rashes. This has been occurring off and on for years but I never understood why. I thought I was allergic to soaps with strong smells or deodorant with aluminum, and every time I thought I had the thrush conquered, it would eventually come back. 

I've noticed at times when I'm always snacking or drinking coffee more than a few times a week, all the symptoms gradually come back. In my bloodwork, I saw that my leukocytes were lower than normal but my doctor never said anything about it, so, I'm chalking this up to gut health. Other than not snacking and drinking coffee as much, what can I do to help heal my gut? I was thinking of fasting but I realize some fasting methods may not be the best for someone with gut problems. 

As a woman, not smelling good is a complete no-no. Now that I think I know what's wrong, I want to learn how to fix or reverse it, if possible. Any suggestions are welcome.",1,1768945435.0,Microbiome,0,1.0,False

This morning I got a cinnamon dolce latte from Starbucks and it filled my car with the most pleasant, cozy aroma, which got me thinking about fragrances with cinnamon notes. Does anyone have recommendations for a warm gourmand cinnamon fragrance? Like cinnamon roasted nuts at a fair, or freshly baked gingersnaps. 

I don't love boozy scents. I currently have Inner Angel from Bath & Body Works in a body cream, which is supposed to be a dupe for Angel's Share by Kilian--I haven't tried that but I get the feeling it will be too boozy for me. I'm ok with milky/creamy notes or coffee notes but they're not my favorites.

1qieien,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1qieien/aita_for_letting_my_dad_report_a_hospital_staffer/,AITA for letting my dad report a hospital staffer for inappropriate behavior towards me?,"A few months back, I (19F) had a depressive episode that culminated in my being placed on a psych hold at the behavioral hospital. It was a pretty lonely experience as you can imagine, and as none of the other patients in my ward were lucid I ended up making friends with a friendly staff member who I'll call Nick (late 30s M). While I was in the hospital, he borrowed my journal and wrote ""beautiful, brilliant, captivating"" in it and pointed to me. 

A month or so later I was at a show with my partner and Nick saw me, so he picked me up into a hug and spun me around. He borrowed my phone and wrote his full name in my notes app, and told me to find him on social media. 

I did find and follow him on Instagram and he started to message me and check in on me. I didn't respond for a long time, and he became frustrated and started DMing me telling me to message him back after every time I posted. I explained that I only use Instagram on browser and gave him my number. I also told him that I'm now engaged and expecting a baby, which he didn't acknowledge at all. 

When I gave him my number, he started texting me asking to go out and catch up over coffee. He again called me ""brilliant, beautiful, and captivating"". I started to feel weird about the whole situation so I sent screenshots of the messages to my most trusted advisor, my dad. I was just looking for advice about whether I should go through with the coffee invite, but my dad got very concerned and said he sees a lot of this behavior in his line of work. He told me it looked like textbook grooming and asked for permission to report the situation to the hospital.

Initially I said no because I'm aware Nick would probably lose his job over this, and I don't feel comfortable doing that to somebody who is married with a young child. But my dad said he shouldn't be working with vulnerable young women at all if he's acting this way, and I trust his judgement so I gave him the okay. But now I'm wondering if I've made a big mistake. I know Nick could potentially be blacklisted from his line of work for such a giant HIPPA violation. I could even see this causing issues in his marriage. I'm worried about the young child's best interests and I feel like I might have just plunged a family into financial instability.

1qiedom,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1qiedom/i_will_not_promote_business_idea_is_this_a_viable/,I WILL NOT PROMOTE. Business Idea - Is this a viable offline marketing channel for larger brands?,"Hey everyone - I’m doing some early-stage market research on a new offline advertising concept and I’d love honest, critical feedback from people who work in marketing, brand, growth, or media buying.

**The idea:**

Instead of just billboards, posters, or bus ads, brands can sponsor **to-go coffee cups**.  
A company buys blocks of branded cups, and those cups get distributed for free to consumers in the area selected by the brand.

So if a brand wants to target commuters in Manchester, London, Leeds, etc., their branding and message/CTA appears on thousands of takeaway cups in those areas.

The thinking is that this channel is:  
• Offline and real-world (like billboards, OOH, transit ads)  
• Hyper-targeted by location  
• High frequency (people carry the cup around)  
• High goodwill (people associate it with something positive – coffee)

**I’m** ***not*** **selling anything here** – just genuinely trying to understand if this is:  
A) A serious marketing channel  
B) A gimmick  
C) Something brands would only test at a small scale

My questions:

👉 If you work with brands or in marketing:  
• Would this be something you’d consider testing?  
• What would make it feel legit vs gimmicky?  
• How would you measure success?  
• What kind of brand or campaign do you think this fits best?

👉 If you’ve bought offline ads before:  
• Would this sit alongside billboards / transit / posters – or not really?  
• What budget range would make sense for something like this to try?

I’m especially interested in hearing from:  
• Media buyers  
• Brand managers  
• Growth marketers  
• Anyone who’s run OOH / offline campaigns

Brutal honesty is welcome. If it’s bad, tell me why. If it’s interesting, tell me what would need to be true for it to actually work.

1qie70v,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qie70v/i_m28_went_through_a_real_life_black_mirror/,I ‘M/28’ went through a real life Black Mirror episode from a Grindr guy ‘M/31’,"So I’m a 28 year old gay male, kinda over the whole one night stand thing and I was hoping to go on some dates. A few months ago, I was on Hinge and Tinder and not getting any luck, so I gave up and swapped to the last known option… Grindr. Now I know, it’s definitely not the place to look if you’re not wanting a hookup, but I gave it a shot.

After scrolling through Grindr; most accounts were anonymous which I assume are all republicans, so I stay away. And the rest were, well pretty much nudes. Suddenly I get a message from someone out of my range of people to speak with, they’re still in my city but there were so many people around me it wasn’t enough range for me to message him directly without buying a subscription but if they message me first, I don’t have to pay anything.

Anyways, we get to talking. He read my bio which I purposely changed to saying, “looking for dates & such” and said he was immediately interested. Conversation went great, he seemed like a genuine person and it seemed like he was looking for exactly the same thing. After talking for about 3-4 days, he said we should meet up and get coffee or something, I said yes and we met up at a coffee shop near my place. First impression was great, he was really nice he matched his picture and the date went really well, he had 0 red flags. After we chatted at the coffee shop we went for a nice walk and then he walked me home after about an hour or so walk.

After the date we talked for a few more hours through text and Snapchat, he seemed very interested in getting to know me, and I did the same with him. We set up a second date on my next day off, but at his place since I have a roommate and didn’t want to make them feel uncomfortable bringing a random guy home.

A few days roll by and I headed over to his place, his place was immaculate, not a shred of dust to be seen. After just one look at his place I knew I should have brushed the cat fur off of my favourite sweater. We ordered pizza, poured a few glasses of wine and watched RuPaul’s drag race for a bit and then threw on hilariously Black Mirror. I haven’t seen much of Black Mirror personally, but I wasn’t opposed to watching it. He said Season 3 was his favourite so I just went with it.

I’m not going to describe what I watched but by the 3rd episode I was kinda done with it and I was a little tipsy from drinking so much wine. He insisted I keep watching but I warned him I might fall asleep on his couch. He said he has a TV in his room too so if I pass out watching it in his bed it’ll be fine and then we can cuddle. Nonetheless I passed out after 30 mins of the next episode.

The next morning was nice, he made me coffee and breakfast and then I went to work. While I’m at work I noticed I wasn’t able to access any of my social media accounts and most importantly, my bank account. Then I look at my service bar which is now showing SOS. I looked at my Apple ID and it was also signed out with the password changed. I was feeling all of the feelings, anxiety, stress. I couldn’t send a single text regardless if it was iMessage or a basic text at this point.

At this point I didn’t know what to do, I felt like my entire identity was stolen. I didn’t know if I should have called the FBI or what, my boss came over to me and asked what was going on, I told him what was happening. He recommended me to avoid the cops and just hire a PI to help get everything back. I told my boss I wasn’t sure if I even had any money left in my bank account after someone logged into my account. My boss offered to cover it until it was figured out as well as give me a temporary phone. I found one PI that suited the experience, he said on the phone that he’s helped numerous people get through similar situations like this. So I naturally agreed.

After meeting with the PI, he asked me for a list of my close friends and family and current/past relationships. So I gave him everyone I knew including the date I was with last night. He said to give him a few days and he’ll hopefully have figured out who has stolen everything from me.

About a week later, I get a knock at my door from the PI. He said he looked into all of my contacts and couldn’t find the person doing this to me, he also mentioned he wasn’t able to find the guy I was seeing. He couldn’t find anyone under the name I gave him. It didn’t make much sense to me but it also did because after trying to contact him with my temp phone, I got no response. So I gave the PI more information about this guy, like where he lives and what he looks like. He asked me to give him some time and hopefully he’ll find him.

Another week goes by, I didn’t hear back from the PI so I’m assuming he’s still working on it but I gave him a call just in case. Didn’t answer so I left a voicemail. The PI got back to me the next day saying the address I gave him was an Airbnb and Airbnb doesn’t give information about their users without a warrant. So that was unfortunately a bust. My next solution was to try and track him down on Grindr using a catfish account but it’s not guaranteed it’ll work. I asked the PI to help with this as well so it’ll double our chances of getting the same guy again.

About a month has gone by, and I haven’t found him on Grindr and neither has the PI. I felt like this has gone nowhere. And then all of a sudden my mother told me she got a weird text from my old phone number. It said insulting things towards her and my family which I won’t repeat. My sister also got a weird text from my phone number. So I told the PI that my phone number is still active and that they are actively using it. The PI said we can use that against him by tracking his IP if he’s using Internet. Sure enough I get a text from him saying “gotcha” and then sends me the troll face they used in one of the Black Mirror episodes we watched.

I let the PI know immediately that it was 100% the guy I went on a date with that’s fucking me over but still don’t have his proper identity. He didn’t use iMessage so his IP couldn’t be tracked and to this day he still has a number of accounts. I got my bank account and phone number back very easily by going to the bank and internet/cell provider and explaining my situation, but I feel like my whole identity was stolen.

1qie6wh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qie6wh,Am I Overreacting? I felt like my SIL was being rude so I told her,"Context:
We had to reschedule our family event to January 24th because Grandma was having surgery around the holidays. This was the same day as the Bills' game against the Broncos. 

Family dynamic: My boyfriend's parents are divorced. My boyfriend(27M) grew up with his mom and dad, while his half-siblings lived with their mom about an 1hr away. 
This event was with my boyfriend's mom's side of the family. Who the half-siblings are not blood-related to, but are always involved. 

My ""sister-in-law"" L (26ishF) and her husband K, (my boyfriend's brother 37ishM) had already told C (my boyfriend's mom) that they would only be staying for a short time. C was under the impression they would stay for the holiday game (grab bag) and maybe watch the football game until half-time. 

When L and K arrived with their child O (4M) the family started off with the usual welcome conversations. While still in the doorway someone asked them why they weren't staying for longer. K responded with ""Beascuse I dont want to watch the game with you people"" this was said loud enough that J's (my boyfriend) cousin B(23ishF) who was on the other side of the room heard it and said a remark back (I dont remember what she said, beascuse I was shocked by K's response, but she didnt look happy) at the time we all let it go and moved on. 

L, K, and O sat on the couch next to J and I(29F), since we are kind of the only ones they know. After a short time talking, getting food, etc L turns to J and I and asked ""Who's Jewish?"" J and I looked at eachother confused, (I thought she already knew, its been over 4 years, but they dont come around often) J began to explain, but before J could get his words out L interrupted by pointing at the star of David on the tree and said ""Do they even know what that means or did they just think it was a pretty star?"" With a laugh. I just looked at her with shock because wtf. J awkwardly tried to explain again but was interrupted again by L, B (J's cousin) happened to be walking by and said loudly ""Yes our grandma's side of the family is Jewish, but we don't condone what's happening right now, so we are not 'that kind of Jewish'"" and walked away. L awkwardly laughed and J continued ""Ya my grandma's parents are from Ukraine and Jewish"" The grandma who just had surgery and who was sitting nearby. Again let it go in the moment and moved on.

For the next few minutes while L, K and O ate on the couch the family dog was exhausted/overwhelmed with the amount of people inside. 

This was the first family event at the uncle's house (B's house as well) usually done at grandma's. So this is an unusual number of people is the smaller space. The dog is not aggressive. 

The dog was begging for food and would lean in to sniff. (Not bite, or take) but she was moving in close. L has a fear of dogs due to past events with her own family. She did not state this to the rest of the family. I knew from past conversations. 

 L would lean back far away from the dog holding her child protectively and would tell the dog to go away. B was trying her best to redirect the dog, but she was also hosting at the same time. K was sitting on the floor at the coffee table eating when the dog came back around. K had a more aggressive tone and told the dog to go away. I calmly stood up and was going to make my way around the coffee table to remove the dog myself. K shoved the dog aggressively, then stood up and stomped towards the dog. I stepped between K and the dog, I said nothing but gave a 'wtf is wrong with you' look to K and L. My blood was boiling so I walked away with the dog to calm down. They have done this with my dogs in the past as well. 

After a moment K comes around, walking around me in the kitchen chatting with others before offering me a taste of the whiskey he brought, I did, and I shared the wine with the homemade syrup J's Aunt had made. Fine moving on. 

I sat back down on the couch and the cat came out L, K, and O love cats so we talked about cats and other family pets. Somehow in the conversation L said somthing like I love cats more, and some dogs are alright, but I just feel like ""some dogs are soulless"" my heart just dropped, like you have the right to your opinion, but to say that around family members who all have dogs was just weird,  insensitive at the least, but again didnt say anything and just let it go in the moment. 

The main issue is mostly the ""I don't want to watch the game with you people"" that was the #1 thing I wanted to focus on because that upset several people, but that was missed in my messages and it feels like her reaction got pushed to defending her child's safety over the dog rather than the hurt things that were said. With that the response was ""I didn't say that"" then some expectations for my behavior in the future were thrown at me.

I didn't say anything in the moment because I didn't think it was appropriate at the family event, and I waited until I was calm and more level headed before I approached her about the issue. 

Am I overreacting? Im being told by the family that I need to have a face to face conversation, but I don't want to. She cut off the conversation before the real issues was even addressed. ",1,1768944609.0,AmIOverreacting,8,1.0,False

A familiar face and heart but a soul with a ware and tear than I remember. But man your eyes never changed. A brown that gets you craving coffee you know? I swear they looked like sitting on porch when I’m 60 with a cup of coffee in my hand and my old golden retriever by my side. 

Your voice had a little quiver to it that I didn’t notice in high school. It wasn’t obvious. But subtle enough to hear the layers of scars your confidence and smile tried to stand on and push down. I kinda liked that. Not in a sadistic or cruel way, but the way your chest puffed when your emotions poured past your lips more than you intended and you pulled your big girl pants up and shot me the “okay next topic” look. 

You were as sweet as ever and I was a nervous wreck. I heard you speak and I stumbled and babbled for hours with my jaw wide open any time you spoke. I adored you, instantly. Even when you get quiet, deep in thought. Staring at nothing I can see your brain working over time calculating every word and screaming at the skies silently. But I think that’s what made you interesting, the steady on the outside but quietly longed for your bruises and scars to fade. Doing your damndest to scrub them from parts of your memory that keep you up at night. The parts that make every meal unappetizing. Every outfit unfitting. Every compliment shallow no matter how genuine. And I think the best of it all, I didn’t feel the urge to fix you. But stand beside you to watch you grow and mend the parts of yourself you shunned from the world. I didn’t care for your scars. I only meant to trace my fingers against them and tell you I’m proud of you. I always found broken things fascinating.

1qie4z1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qie4z1,Tanvi atp stop coping,"Guys, you can hate me as much as you want from the heart, but listen before labeling me a potential papist.

1st image - Azooz saying why did you call your bf when everything went good and saying he slept on the couch, and the girl (maybe her friend) saying he (Azooz) raped her (maybe Tanvi told him), while Azooz seems confused about what went wrong. What's her (Tanvi's cuck bf) saying? Prolly messaging him.


2nd image - Check the timeline. It is clearly visible the chats were done 1:29–1:35.
She is making claims like ""usko ghar jaana hai"" kuch weird lag rha "" to her bf. Why? Didn't this happen at the time when he was supposed to rpe you? But it seems quite funny.
1st case: maybe it was an actual comfortable situation and she just exaggerated.
2nd case: maybe they consumed heavy weed.
And if you want to listen to what she said in VNs, she said (""yaar coffee mang rha"" hahah lame laugh ""chudegi kya?"")


3rd image - Timeline 12:41 (before rpe as she claims). Her cuck bf saying leave the place, but she is just chilling and replying to him like it's kinda impossible to leave. Then he said I'm coming, and she straight up says NO lol. Why?
And she is more into Azooz as she is saying I have to stay with him for more time.


4th image - Timeline 6-7 Jan. She sent him plenty of VNs but didn't even play a single one. (God knows why). And here Azooz is saying for this we need to ""have unprotected sex"", meaning both parties confirming sex is done and protected. And she is telling him that I got infection and all that stuff.

5th image - Timeline 12:13. Her cuck bf knows everything from midnight 12, but he is just waiting? And if she is messaging everyone from 12, when did they both have intercourse? Like she was riding him while chatting with her bf?
Her bf saying leave immediately, and she is giving lame-ass reasons that I'm even crying for leaving but he starts making angry on me.


6th image - Timeline 6-7 Jan. Azooz trying to confront her that her cuck bf said to him never try to meet her (bro he banged her already), but she forgot about teddy and jacket at his apartment, and Tanvi saying should I do porter and they agree on it.


7th image - Timeline 6-7 Jan. It seems like Tanvi's cuck bf is threatening Azooz for (no need when ""chidya chug gyi khet""), and he is saying does he need to worry? While Tanvi itself saying (""ki kal dekhti hu kaise karega""). Imagine how cuck he was , while liking his message. Bro,  wtf he raped you?


8th image - 6 Jan. Not even 24 hours complete, and she is messaging Azooz and saying (""baki dosto ko nhi batana""). Well why? Now the whole world knows. Even she herself transferred every single thing via WhatsApp and IG live reporting till 3 am. And what is lyk? And brah? Humor?
Yeah for your rpist?


9th image - 6 Jan. After some hours she is saying you have to meet her at this specific location by 1 pm for tests and no porter (save her money). Wanted her jacket while he breathes bad sense, denying to meet her (maybe because his name came out in medical test).


10th image - Timeline 1:30 to 2:15. She is giving live updates to her friends saying the same thing 3 times (like because consumption of heavy weed) and replying she is fine till 1:40? And why the hell  they both seem so normal or freaky? Like it's so casual talks?
Then her friend saying call her if anything goes wrong, but guess what? Nothing happened till 2:15.
(IS SHE LYING ALL THE TIME WHEN SHE SAID WE WERE BOTH ASLEEP (1 AM TO 2 AM) THEN HE TOUCHING HER INAPPROPRIATELY AND STARTS TO RPE HER????)
If she is casually talking to everyone, when did they have intercourse? And when did rpe happen????


11th image - Timeline 1:30–1:45. She is talking to her another friend and why the heck is it so freaky???? Emoji selection is just like a fun game to her but in the timeline of (1 am to 2 am).
Saying ""chodegi""? She and her friend making it too normal? But her friend also smells something is wrong and asking her (""high hai kya"") — is she drunk?


12th image - Proof of her own statement.
I mean she just chatted 12 am to 3 am continuously to each and every friend that is online. When did rpe happen when she says no? I didn't listen. Did you listen, viewers? Nope.


13th image - Lame-ass proof of saying she messaged her bf at 3 am (according to her). No timeline. Maybe 100% sure it was from morning when he came up to pick her up.

I buy Cafe Bustello because I enjoy the chocolatey notes and I like my coffee very strong (use espresso blend). The issue is Cafe Bustello comes in a vacuum sealed package but once you open it, there’s no sealing it.

I buy the smallest size and store it in a container but the container isn’t sealed. When I jump from the last cup of coffee from an older package of grounds to a newer bag I can taste a noticeable different in flavor. It’s just much more vibrant, much more noticeable to me than freshly grinding the beans.

I looked around for suggestions and even watched the James Hoffman video but everyone seems to say they suck and just to use the bag, which obviously I cannot do. The one James recommended is like $70 or $80 and that just seems silly considering my setup. I also really value easy routines which is why I just buy Cafe Bustello and don’t grind my beans fresh so not having to complicate things would be nice

1qie1nu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qie1nu/th_lilliths_lillies/,[TH] Lillith’s Lillies,"The city lights are exceptionally bright this evening.

The hard pavement grates against my spine as I squint at the colors twinkling around me. I almost got out of the way in time, as the black sedan veered off the road, onto the sidewalk, taking out street signs and vendor carts barreling towards me, but I wasn’t quite fast enough. Pain exploded through my body as I rolled over the hood and slammed into the sidewalk with a squelching thud. If only I had started that New Year’s resolution 4 months ago to start going to the gym I may have been able to dive out of the way, but probably not. Even if he missed me, I saw his face, and I’m certain this was intentional. 

My breathing slows as my life source leaks from the wounds peppering my body. Bleeding out on the pavement in front of my quant florist shop isn’t how I thought I would die, but the lights are beautiful and my favorite scent of lilys fills my nostrils. 

*One day before.* 

April 22nd. Just another Thursday. I have to finish that order of yellow roses for Mr. Thompson, finalize the inventory for the Pastor’s wedding, and make 8 corsages in various colors for the upcoming Cityview Highschool prom tomorrow night. 

I slowly sip my coffee and look out at the street below from the balcony of my flat, nestled above my cozy floral shop below. Admiring the fog rising off the pavement as the sun rises over the city. I start my mornings before most so only a handful of cars have driven by an otherwise busy street as I enjoy my vanilla macchiato and plan for my day. 

Heading to the door with the dregs of my coffee I step out, lock up, and walk down the stairs to my shop. Entering the door I’m filled with a giddy sense of joy, the joy that comes from being surrounded by my favorite colors and scents, the leafy green, the stark white, deep reds, vivid pinks purples and blues. I head to my workstation and start arranging Mr. Thompson’s 23 yellow roses into a bouquet for his wife. 

He’s swinging by around lunch to pick them up to celebrate his 23rd wedding anniversary. Mr. Thompson runs the bakery down the street and every April for the last 23 years he has ordered yellow roses. One for each year of marriage. I still just charge him for the single yellow rose, even though at this point he’s ordered hundreds, because I idolize love, and hope one day to find what he has. 

As I put the final touches on his bouquet and move towards my desk so I can finalize the invoice for the Pastors wedding to email to them for final sign off, the bell above my door twinkles. 

Stepping through the door into my shop is hands down the most attractive man I have ever seen. He looks like my “book boyfriends” brought to life, and I fully expect wings to sprout from his broad shoulders. He has to duck to enter the doorway and his frame barely fits through in his form fitted navy pinstriped suit. His ice blue eyes meet mine from across my shop and he swoops his jet black hair out of his face. As he saunters towards me I can’t help but appreciate his form, as his suit leaves very little to the imagination, his sculpted muscles - and other…things… - bulging through his well tailored suit. 

“Good morning” I stammer, “welcome to Lillith’s Lilys, how may I help you.” 

“Lillith’s Lilys, that’s an insteresting name” mutters the strange beautiful man. 

“Haha yes, I’m Lillith and my favorite flower is a lily” I giggle. “I’m an aspiring poet and love alliteration, but my first love is flowers.”

“Well, funnily enough Lillith, I’m here to order a dozen Lily’s, as white as fresh fallen snow.”

“Ok sir, can I have a name for the order?”

“Mr. Smith”

“Ok Mr. Smith, I’ll need you to fill out this form including your full name, address, and contact information” as I hand him a clipboard with the form attached and a pen.

“Oh, can we just skip all that, I would prefer to buy them now and pay in cash” tossing the clipboard back onto the counter. 

*Ok, strange, but I have a dozen white lillies already wrapped up. So, maybe? Still need the form though*. 

“Apologies sir, I still need this form filled out for my records.”

“Lillith, I’ll pay double, hell even triple to avoid all this, you hand me those white lillies I see behind you, pay, leave, and we forget this ever happened” he growls slamming $800 on my desk. This is way more than double, hell more than triple what I would normally charge. 

“Ok, sir that’s fine. Here you go Mr. Smith. And apologies for your loss.”

“What the fuck do you mean, my loss” he snarls, his eyes clouding as a shadow crosses over his face. 

Taken aback, I stammer “apologies sir, but white lillies are traditionally a death flower, for funerals. My condolences.”

Angrily snatching the flowers from my hand, Mr Smith storms towards the door. At the last minute he turns and whispers over his shoulder, “it was lovely to meet you Lillith, I’m sure we will see each other again, and who knows maybe I’ll have some white lillies for you.”

Shaken by his comments I lock the door behind him. Pacing around my shop pondering what the actual fuck just happened. Did I just sell flowers to a hit man? Does he have a calling card: what the fuck. I run to my laptop and quickly google murders in the area, stringing the search query with white lillies, and over a dozen unsolved murders pop up, all of them mentioning white lillies strewn across the body. The blood drains from my face as I hear a knock at the door, glancing up, I see Mr. Smith glaring at me, slicing his finger across his throat and mouthing “you’re next.”",1,1768944296.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

 I'm a guy 20 years old, in college right now. I had friends as a kid but I moved states when i was 14/15 and lost all my friends. Since then i have literally not had a single real friend. I do somehow have a girlfriend tho and I am blessed to have her. She is my best friend but I have no one else. And right now we're doing long distance because I'm at college so I don't see her anymore besides phone calls which we don't get to do often enough, and it's not the same as real connection. Im in my second semester at a 4 year college as a transfer.

Anyway I had an interaction earlier that made me realize how much I avoid people and how it really is my fault. Guy in my class was very nice and invited me to grab food in the dining hall between lecture and lab. I was like no thanks im full. I feel like i could tell he felt bad but i just left and was like ""cya later"", when i could've said yes and at least got a coffee and worked on our assignment together. I feel like he  wont ask me again. I didnt realize till after the fact that I should've just said yes. Because I always complain about feeling alone and stuff but when opportunities are there for me i turn them down and avoid people and I don't know why. Situations like this happen to me often. 

It's kinda weird because I havent had friends for a while and I've been perfectly fine and content, but lately I've been craving some kind of connection and friednship, but I just like find ir really hard to talk to epople. I used to think I don't need anyone but I think people with friends are probably happier and life is better for them. But at the same time I feel like I just don't have very much to say and I prefer to keep to myself honestly. Maybe it's the extremely social college I'm at right now that's just making me feel left out and different. 

Anyway, I think I should make friends as I haven't had any for years. I don't even know how to have a friend at this point or what friends do or talk about or anything. But how should I go about trying to make new friends? Thanks.

1qidyem,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qidyem,The best coffee in my freezer - in tribute to David Lynch’s 80th birthday,"Today, the screenwriter, director, writer and painter David Lynch would have turned 80 yo.

Nothing better than a *damn good cup of coffee* (to use his words) to honor the memory of this master, who as many probably knows was a coffee aficionado.

Fun fact: after his death last January, his family auctioned off some of his belongings and James Hoffmann ended up buying one of his automatic coffee makers! Hoffmann’s video here: [I Bought David Lynch’s Weird Coffee Maker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd1O-M_Vf2Q).

In his honor I decided to brew a cup of the best coffee I have in my freezer:

* **Variety**: Gesha
* **Process**: Natural
* **Country/Region**: Colombia (Valle del Cauca)
* **Farm**: CGLE Cerro Azul (Café Granja La Esperanza)
* **Producer**: Rigoberto Herrera
* **Altitude**: 1700-1900m

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Fellow coffee friends, this coffee is absolutely insane!

Vibrant, bright, stimulating… it’s hard to describe it without resorting to superlatives and emotional exaggeration.

The aromas are intense and leap out of the cup. You don’t have to make any effort at all to perceive the sensory notes, they’re a show on their own. What I get most strongly is rose liqueur, very well integrated with the freshness of blackberry. In the background there’s a fruity, tropical base that I can’t quite pin down (maybe what the bag identifies as mango?).

On the mouth, this coffee is a lively party. It feels like fireworks going off in your mouth (like those popping candy powders). What creates this sensation is an almost artificial flavor, the kind you get from floral syrups like Monin, combined with a very present acidity (bringing ginger and lemon vibes).

That acidity comes together with a very present sweetness and body, perfectly balanced and not overwhelming, reminiscent of the sweetness of blackberry jam or syrup. The result is a very juicy cup that leans toward liqueur-like, yet somehow preserves a lot of lightness (kind of inexplicable). The finish is long and leaves your mouth salivating for a long time. I swear, I finished 30min ago and I’m still salivating.

Coffees at this level make me understand what “layered” means… there are so many sensations, aromas, and flavors that you end up feeling electrified and stimulated. It makes you want to dance or crawl under the table or something weird like that hahaha (good way to honor our beloved weirdo).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In a bit, there’ll be a group meditation session in honor of this rare soul that was David Lynch - and I’ll be showing up well caffeinated!

Lynch was one of the main advocates of Transcendental Meditation, a simple meditation technique based on a mantra. I’ve been practicing it for a while because of his influence, and it was one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life. If anyone has tried meditating and couldn’t stick with it, I highly recommend this practice :)

At least picked a better book, shit bird (Part 1)","Where the fuck do I even start? First, fuck u/Penguinho for literally making me read this fuck-all book. I won't forget this. ^((/uj no but I squealed in delight when I saw your post because I love attention and stepping up to a challenge. Thank you for the dopamine boost).) 

(\*looks through notes\*)

(\*sighs\*)

Usually, because I'm SuCh A GoOd PeRsOn, I won't go after debut authors, indie authors, smaller books, etc. I think people should form their own opinions and at least give the book a chance rather than letting me shoot them down before the book even has a chance to take off. 

In this case, fuck you. This book is embarrassingly plagiarized and I'm not okay with that. There's a difference between narrowing your eyes and saying ""this is kind of ACOTAR-y"" or tropes that everyone uses, vs. an author who is straight up, beat for beat, copying a story. I mean...*this is the same exact fucking story*. Honestly, I'm angry on SenLinYu's behalf. *Alchemised* was ass and I'm tired of people telling me it's good, but this is straight up plagiarism. And if SLY wanted to sue for plagiarism, I would stand behind that. I would agree. Hell, they should. This is even marketed as something similar to *Alchemised* and *The Handmaid's Tale* ^((which...I'm sure HMT is a good book, but I am forever angry at this book for throwing open the door to some of the most limp-dick discourse and ham-fisted fiction that I've ever read).) 

This was originally going to be two posts, but it's bleeding over into three. Because even though the book is half the length of *Alchemised* and *Manacled*, I find that I have so much more to say about it because it's such a fuck-all book. I realized it's because this book is going to require small asides and lectures on American politics, geopolitics, and fascism to demonstrate why this reads like a panicked treatise written by a 15-year-old who just started paying attention to politics and they're seeing other people's memes on Facebook and they don't really *understand the thing* and that part of my review is helping you *understand the thing* in the most efficient way possible. In fact, I'm moving a lot of that exposition to an Appendix section because I don't want you to have to scroll through it to see the plot.

* **A VERY IMPORTANT THING BEFORE WE PROCEED: This post isn't meant to open the door to more people talking about America and how fascism is/would creep up on us as if you don't have to hear about this every fucking day. Anything political I'm talking about here pertains to the world that the book built and why I feel like it is stupid and wouldn't happen. I am** ***not*** **saying ""such a thing as fascism could never happen to us"" so get that out of your brain right now**. If any of you want to talk about the state of American politics right now outside of anything pertaining to this book, I'm taking a toaster bath and you won't get any other posts. And if you bring up Donald Fucking Trump, I'm dragging you in the bath with me. He is not a character in this book. 

(\*long-suffering sigh\*)

***Okay so here is our setting***

This is set in a dystopian United States that has fallen apart because fascism is bad and our dictatorial fascist president Richard Haynes, after being in office for six months, proposed a ""New American Order"" which was a blueprint for ""true Americans"", uniformity, very clearly a blatant white nationalist thing, etc. People just started going along with it, Americans of ""questionable descent"" were imprisoned (this isn't just minorities, mind you), women were completely removed from the workplace so that we could return to a traditional family structure.

*Pause:* This is stupid and wouldn't happen because women are 50% of the workforce and you couldn't rip away 50% of the workforce without serious economic implications. 2/3 of American households with kids rely on dual income. So how does our genius fascist plan to make sure these families don't lose everything because they can't afford it? (See Appendix A).

*Unpause:* Two years into his term, the bad president was found guilty of violating the Fourteenth Amendment and our FMC ""*rejoiced. Surely this mean people would finally see the ruthlessness inherent in his administration""*, but *""the next day, the judges were doused in gasoline and set on fire (*This made me spit out my coffee and cry laugh because that is fucking hilarious. )*...his dissenters went quiet. Fear seeped into our bloodstream, an icy poison.*..*No one saved us from the violence*"" of the subsequent and aggressive shift.

*Pause:* This is stupid and wouldn't happen because, if by ""judges"" our author means The Supreme Court (those 9 motherfuckers in robes who like to ruin our lives), then they wouldn't be in charge of finding the president ""guilty"" of violating the [14th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/). This duty falls to Congress (both the House of Representatives and the Senate. You know. The career path of the worst person you knew in high school debate club). And if the President is found ""guilty"" of violating the Constitution by the end of the excruciating process, nothing happens unless there is a vote to remove them from office/bar them from holding office again. Otherwise, it's something like a slap on the wrist or an impeachment that means dick all if nothing changes. Plus, the 14th Amendment addresses several crucial things, including birthright citizenship, due process, voting rights, and that pesky insurrection clause. So...which section did this president violate? Unfortunately, hateful rhetoric doesn't mean you've violated the Constitution. (See Appendix B). 

*Unpause:* There was a protest at Captiol Hill that ended with hundreds of citizens being gunned down by our super bad President's militia (the National Stability Force). All news sources were shut down except for one. Access to anything non-approved on the internet was forbidden (yeah because that's going to stop us bro I need porn and RCJ). People were fleeing across the borders, Canada tried to help but the president sent soldiers up there to stop it. Women have been declared property barely worthy of anything but being baby incubators. 

*Pause:* You're telling me that military action against civilians wouldn't cause violent backlash and riots? In America? I don't know if you're aware, but Americans don't require much to riot. (See Appendix C). And what happens when women have hit menopause and can't have kids? Retirement communities? What about infertile women? Do they force IVF? What if pregnancy is too much of a risk for the woman and child? Again, too many logistics are left to the imagination and I mean this in a bad way.

*Unpause*: As a result of this slow takeover by the new president, foreign shit just...fell apart? The United Nations, NATO, and WTO have dissolved as a result. 

*Pause:* Yeah okay sure. The only thing keeping the international community from washing their hands of us is worry over the stability of the dollar and maintaining trade relationships  This wouldn't even get *close* to happening because, unfortunately, America has its dick in everyone's business and unless our genius fascist president has genius ideas about maintaining trade...America and everyone else is fucked. But especially America in a way that wouldn't be good for our fascist president. Americans tend to like their things. And we don't make most of our things here. The author makes no mention of how any of this affected trade or economic stability internationally because, again, this is something that a 15-year-old wrote the second she saw her first ""fascism"" meme and has *no* concept of geopolitics and all she does is throw out a few sentences and we're supposed to say ""yeah makes sense"".

*Unpause*: The military *""marched into private homes on raids and civilians revolted. Guns were pried from cold, dead hands as the citizens clung to one of the founding tenets of our country"".*

*FUCKING PAUSE: DO I NEED TO REALLY EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU?! THERE ARE MORE GUNS THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAN PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY. NO WAY IN FUCKING HELL WOULD THIS HAPPEN.* (See Appendix D for a very unhinged rant)

*Unpause*: Right before the election that would have seen him removed, he declared martial law and completely took over the country.

*Pause:* So you're telling me that this fuckwad who likely ruined his own economy took over all 50 states with no intervention from state-level leadership, who also have every right to exercise their own authority against the president if he infringes on their state-level leadership? Are all 50 governors supporters? How did he pull that off? Does the author not realize how fucking huge America is?



(\*exhale\*) Okay. I think....I think I got most of what makes up the political setting here. You need to read this shit, though. It's absolutely fucking hilarious.

***THE PLOT***

Our FMC is ""Sophia"". She is a field medic (sound familiar?) who is called into the general's office (a guy who is like an uncle to her) and straight up volun-told by their Prime Delegate that a ""Hunter"" (the world's equivalent of a Death Eater. The fascist military baddies) is willing to go traitor and give them information in exchange for a ""woman"". No clemency in exchange. No promises of protection post-war. Nothing. Just a contact who can slip in and out of the base once a week without anyone noticing, and she has to be a woman. Of course they have a very obvious conversation (very obvious conversations are a running theme in this fucking book) where they explain exactly what is going on in case we didn't realize it (*he wants a plaything*, *even though we're supposed to be fighting for the rights of women.* Oh good. I didn't pick up on that possibility. Thanks for explaining that. Thanks for elaborating, for pages, why this would be upsetting and confusing.) We get several more pages explaining to us why this is important for her to do and that she's going to do it even though she's angry and humiliated (we later learn it's because it's easier to hide what he's doing if he can make it look like he is keeping a woman to hook up with in the event that they get caught together. Good logic. He could have told them this up front so that his contact doesn't go into the situation scared out of her mind, but it has to be part of the slow reveal that explains to us why he's Good, Actually^(TM) ).  


What baffles me about this is that this guy who is supposed to be her uncle figure basically does a very weak attempt to fight for her. But ultimately, she is sent. This confuses me because...are you telling me that the rebellion is short of women? She is always around the main base. She has friends who watch her. You can't grab a field soldier? Someone who is in and out frequently? Someone who actually understands discretion and field ops? 

Sophia has friends who care about her and she pushes them away because one of her good friends was captured and likely taken to a prostitute house. So she does that whole ""everyone close to me gets hurt so I'm pushing away my many friends"". This is stupid and selfish because she isn't the only one losing friends and people she loves. She hasn't given *everything* for this war. No more than everyone else has. She hasn't given every inch of her soul and taken several hits to her dignity and lost the respect of everyone around her because she is desperate to find solutions, even if they don't like those solutions. *Manacled* and even fucking *Alchemised* give us an FMC who is more resigned to her position for good reason and she's basically alone here. And while I want to validate that everyone's pain is worth caring about, I'm going to go ahead and that she's stupid and deeply selfish because consider this: maybe other people need friends and being a friend to them would be a nice thing to do. Ugh. Fucking idiot.

She meets up with Lucas Scott in an abandoned house a short walk away from their base who is a ""Blood Colonel"" (high up in the super bad military) and who leads several televised executions, so he already has a reputation as a murder face murder face murder face. We later find out that he does it ""humanely"" because they no longer use guns for public executions (too much ammo for too many traitors. Even though this is America and there are more rounds of ammo than trees, probably). So he uses a surgical scalpel for a quick stab to the throat that makes them pass out quickly from blood loss and die. Others use hammers and shit. What a guy, this one.

At their meeting, he's cold to her, makes it clear he isn't going to rape her or make her have sex with him. Oh good thank god because I, the reader, completely thought this was going to happen. He's feeding her information as revenge for his sister getting ""hurt and killed"" (sound familiar? Oh wait. But it was Draco/Kaine's mother who was the cause for their betrayal. So it's different enough). There's a quick moment when he has to save her by shooting a few of his comrades when she's doing field medic shit, then he wants to teach her how to fight (sound familiar?) to keep her alive and starts giving her things to help with her safety. Knives. Brass knuckles. Clothes. A bike. And of course everyone is like ""where are you getting this shit?"" and she's like ""idk ahhaha"" because she is the least discreet person alive and genuinely doesn't understand things like ""I want you to wear a dark hoodie when you travel around because it's easier to dissolve into the dark"" and she gets *very* offended when he says ""are you stupid? How do you not understand this basic thing?"" 

Our fellow Lucas gives them a tip about someone's daughter who has been promised to him. He tells them about the plan to transport her, this is the perfect time to snatch her. Because he is grossed out by a 16-year-old being his wife (I don't think this makes him a good person. I consider this the minimum for human decency. But cool of him to give them a chance to get her anyway). Earlier on there's a conversation where he says ""there's no way I'm getting out of this alive, idiot. Did you really think I would?"" And she has this moment when she can't wrap her head around doing something even if he would die in the process/not survive/likely be purposely killed by the Defiance. Because she's an idiot and doesn't understand the concept of someone who has nothing left to lose. He expected to be killed during the rescue of this girl, but he wasn't. Goody.

At this point it's been weeks and weeks since they started meeting up and fighting, ""bantering"" (she's a sarcastic asshole and he is less than impressed by it. Calls her ""stupid"" a lot and he is correct). And I know it's been weeks because at about four times in the 50% of this book that I've read, she tells us that more weeks pass. They chat more and get to know each other, some ""....chemistry?"" develops between them. She starts feeling a little more defensive of him but can't exactly say anything out loud.

Then one of my favorite conversations happens. By ""favorite"", I mean that I completely and utterly reject the entire fucking thing. This is one of those ""he's not actually a *bad guy*. He's just...*trapped"".* Lucas points out how Haynes rose to power by creating fear of the ""other"", but this is stupid because if his rise to power indicates anything, it's that he didn't ""other"" people as much as decide to say they're ""other"" and start arresting/removing them from the workforce. He didn't find a way to slowly poison the views of the American people. Or perhaps our author is terrible at explaining more details about how he did this because she dedicated literally a paragraph to explaining the start of his rhetoric. It's at this point that Lucas points out how many people are trapped from fear, and it indicates that he is also trapped in a regime he doesn't believe in.

*FUCKING PAUSE:* Here is why I reject this as a point in his favor. And I don't care if this makes me sound self-righteous. Because I am correct, and you'd do well to understand why I am. His status as someone incredibly high-ranking in the stabby military indicates one thing: *effort*. Unless his plan was always to infiltrate the highest levels (I don't know yet, but I highly doubt this), he was given promotions and power. How was he given this? Because they recognized his dedication to the cause/skills as a murder-face-murder-face-murder-face/someone who is good at organizing the stabby military people. If he never believed it, he could have done the right thing and *not* been in the military. Because it seems like all of the military is voluntary. He could have found a way to protect his sister. He could have, I don't know, *joined the rebellion*. Tried to run. Because let me tell you something: I would rather set myself on fire than participate in something like that willingly out of fear. And, again, he is only turning because it suddenly affected him. He would have gone on doing the same thing if his sister hadn't been killed. I reject this limp-dick justification because it doesn't make him secretly good. It makes him a fucking coward. 

At least Draco and Kaine still believed in their causes and only did this because ""I don't want you to win. I want the people who killed my mom to *lose*."" And before you think I am defending or justifying anything, pause and breathe for a moment and hear me out. In America, we recently had ""Martin Luther King, Jr."" day in celebration of one of our most impactful civil rights leaders. He wrote out something that affected me deeply and changed my perspective a when I read it a few years ago. In ""Letters from Birmingham Jail"", he declares that the biggest detriment to the rights of his people aren't the white supremacists or insane Christians. It is the ""white moderate"", who would rather waffle or say ""I don't agree with your methods of rebellion but I still support your cause"" but not *do* anything. And this is why I reject Lucas. Because, TO BE CLEAR, I fucking hate nazis and white supremacists. And I hate that I have to say this out loud. BUT, at least with nazi boys like Draco, you are looking them in the face and knowing exactly who they are and what they are about. It's the enemy you know. Not the waffly coward who won't stand for their principles unless they are being affected personally. And this is a huge difference between showing up to a protest with your little sign and being complicit in this type of world. Being complicit in the highest levels of the military. This is worse than that cop friend you have who became a cop to ""make change within"" and all you want to do is pat their head and wait until they realize that they're answering to someone who doesn't want to make changes from the inside but good for you anyway.

Hiding in your house from this is one thing. That makes me purse my lips and grudgingly kind of say ""yeah...I guess"". But our guy is *complicit* and *actively participating*. So no. I reject this. Fuck you, Lucas, and your limp-dick cowardice. Fuck you for participating at any point in this and continuing to participate rather than take any stand until you were personally affected. And fuck Sophia for thinking this is endearing and a Good Trait. It is not. And fuck the author for trying to pull the wool over our eyes and think this is an excuse for being complicit like this. 

*Unpause:* I can't believe how much I've already unpacked here, and I haven't even done the 50% that I've read. Yep. It appears this is going to be three posts. And I also haven't already unpacked all of the other ways that this type of a fascist takeover wouldn't work and our author has no fucking idea what she's talking about.

Fuck this fuck-all *I'm-15-and-I just-learned-what-fascism-is-and-also-just-read-the-Handmaid's-Tale*\-ass-book.

Below is the appendix where I give a lot more information on shit that is American-based but I understand how many of you don't want to read through all of that shit to get to the book. So. Read only if you want. But it won't really change how you experience this book.



**APPENDIX:**

**A:** Over 80% of nurses in the United States are women. Around 70% of teachers are women. The reason I'm bringing up these two fields is because these are women-dominated fields that require multiple years of education and training and even the biggest dumbass fascist alive wouldn't say ""no it's fine. Just rip nurses out of the workplace and get as many men trained as possible"" as if our workforce could sustain such a thing. Also consider that something like 2/3rd of American families with children have both parents working. Most in this situation cannot sustain a household and finances without dual income. How would our genius fascist make sure that families don't lose their homes, can feed their children, pay for basic expenses, etc.? Social programs and universal basic income? ^(lol jk America would burn itself to the ground before going socialist.) And if they're talking about removing and imprisoning Americans of ""questionable descent"", our author is going to have to be more specific. Because even Americans who I'd call ""white as fuck"" don't all look like your white nationalist poster child. How would they determine that? ""This fellow's Italian ancestry came out a little too strong so his descent is questionable""? ^(cuz boy can I relate to Italian ancestry coming out swinging.) So we're further dwindling down the workplace? Removing further productivity by removing anyone who looks ""questionable""? And no, this isn't just an immigration thing. Our author makes it clear that they don't have to be immigrants to fall into this category. It's just ""anyone who doesn't look like a true American"". Well that's vague an not actionable and if we're going to have successful fascism, we gotta be specific and actionable. Duh.

  
**B:** Usually if a governing official is accused of violating the Constitution, there are *several* rounds of voting that take it from the small committee to the final 51% needed to officially ""impeach"" them, assuming that's how it's used and that's what our author means? Being found ""guilty"" of it? Because violating the Constitution does dick all of you're just ""guilty"" of it but there is no vote to take action against it (it takes a 2/3rd senate vote to remove the President from office for violating the Constitution, for instance. This has never happened. Either they get impeached, which is the equivalent of a wrist slap, or they have resigned beforehand). Outside of removal from office or barring them from holding office again, charging a president with violating the constitution does nothing. ^(It is also an American institution to try to bust the president for violating the Constitution and it happens nonstop in every Presidency so, again...this holds no weight.)

*Quick education:* This is stupid because the [14th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/) addresses several very foundational things, including birthright citizenship, due process, voting rights, etc. There's also this pesky little section that also says any governing officials can't engage in insurrection or rebellion against the government. If everything we have learned so far is correct, the only thing I can really think maybe Haynes was violating due process rights by detaining people? Rights of citizens? Definitely not insurrection because, and I know this is hard to swallow...hateful rhetoric isn't insurrection and isn't grounds for any discipline under the 14th Amendment. If the issue is that he's violating due process rights, I'm additionally sorry to tell you that denying due process rights is an American institution. 

**C:** While America is not quite as effective at revolting as say...the French (""lower ze retirement age? 'ow about we burn Paris to ze fucking ground?!"" Mad respect, y'all). I *cannot, in any universe, see the American people rolling over this at all if there is a large massacre at the capitol.* A lot of our protests and riots tend to be largely demonstrative or performative (cute sign, though), but we've had our fair share of burning down cities in retaliation to government tyranny. Even if this president managed to quell riots across the fucking country, the damage would be unspeakable, the civilian and law enforcement casualties would be insane, the jails would overflow, resources would be all but spent, infrastructure would be dick-all. Not to mention the many, many, *many* insurance claims that would have to be processed at 50% the speed because we lost half of the workforce, remember? Again...no awareness of anything here. She wants to compare this to 1930s Germany, but...actually, don't get me started on that limp-dick comparison. It just further demonstrates how much she doesn't know about fascist takeovers.

**D:** This section might get kind of...graphic? I understand if you don't want to read about Americans and their guns. You can skip it. This is the end of the post. But...as an American living in a conservative state...I can drive five minutes down the road to the sporting goods store, get a quick background check, buy a handgun for $400, strap it to my thigh, and go to the grocery store for some potato chips *100% legally*. Gun still strapped to my thigh. Instead of daggers. Because I'm 150% FMC. Someone breaks into my house or threatens violence on my property? Chances are, the law will protect me if I light them up (see: Castle Doctrine). Because we value gun rights above human life. And even if this fictional president removes this law, I'm laying the foundation to help you understand how much the law protects my right to guns. The moment Americans got a whiff of their guns being taken away, they would invade every sporting goods store and sell them out of all guns, ammo, and accessories in under an hour. They'd light up a cop before giving up their guns. They'd barricade themselves in their homes and throw smoke grenades if anyone came near their guns. And it's not just conservatives who have guns. Leftists have guns. More liberals have guns than you'd think. And since we're neighborly, I can see people sharing guns with their neighbors or offering protection. 

In two sentences, our author explains how quickly guns were taken away. I cannot stress enough how much this wouldn't happen. At least not without series casualties, rioting in the streets, property damage, etc. And if we're being serious, heavy economic damage considering the fact that the industrial complex for civilian weaponry is...embarrassingly massive. The most conservative president alive could have support, but the second they come for guns...it's over. Again...total lack of understanding of, in the least, economic impact. Because consider this: fascism isn't just scary words and military enforcement. You also have to make sure *the economy doesn't fall apart, or people get very, very upset.*

From what I can tell, that exact naming basically maps to the Harvard Extension School ALM Biotechnology track. It’s not like GSAS, HMS, or SEAS has a master’s degree with that same label.

HES career services guidance states, “If Extension School is not included in the school name, ‘in Extension Studies’ needs to be included on the degree name,” but LinkedIn feels way looser than a resume.

Part of why I’m asking is that I’m genuinely trying to find a path that opens doors, including MBA opportunities. My academic background isn’t strong, so I’m looking for a legit credential that can create real opportunities. And I clearly get that this is an official Harvard University degree, with access to a Harvard ID, resources, commencement, etc.

My mom (58F) just left after a month-long visit from Brazil, and I'm struggling to process what this visit revealed about our relationship. My husband is furious about how she treated me and wants to set hard boundaries or cancel her next visit to see our baby entirely.

Quick background: She physically disciplined me as a child, and constantly minimizes it when I try to talk about it. She also did not protect me when her partner sexually harassed me as a teenager. I've spent years rationalizing this due to culture, her upbringing, and the idea that she ""did her best."" This visit forced me to stop rationalizing.

During her stay, she repeatedly:

• Criticized our house despite being warned in advance it wouldn't be utterly clean because I'm pregnant and exhausted and my husband has a lot going on at work

• Used possessive language about my daughter (“my baby”) and resisted correction

• Lied about small, observable things (saying she washed knives when she only wiped them, denying actions I directly witnessed and had proof on our Ring camera)

• Repeatedly violated basic food safety (tasting raw chicken seasoning, touching raw meat then cabinets without washing hands), and dismissed concerns as us being ""too much""

• Spilled coffee on our couch while playing with her mug and laughed when I pointed out her behavior

• Treated our home as hers, calling the guest room

""my bedroom,"" appliances ""my machine,"" and leaving over 80 Ibs of belongings behind saying she will take with her in her next visit

She never apologizes. There is no accountability. Only excuses, deflection, or portraying herself as the victim. She refuses to acknowledge the physical abuse or her partner's behavior, even when confronted calmly.

The current problem is that she plans to return in two months for two weeks around the birth to ""help."" I already don't trust her with boundaries or food safety, so I'm planning to cook and freeze over 80 meals in advance to avoid her cooking around a newborn. That doesn't feel like help.

Here’s where I need some help:

Am I overreacting? Is it acceptable to want distance even with a baby coming? How do you set boundaries with a parent like this without emotionally collapsing?

TL;DR: My mom's visit exposed chronic lying, boundary violations, and refusal to acknowledge past abuse. She plans to return when my baby is born. I'm pregnant, grieving the relationship I thought we had, and unsure how to protect myself, my child and my marriage without imploding.",2,1768944000.0,BabyBumps,4,0.63,False
1qidwos,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1qidwos/i_think_i_want_some_friends/,I think I want some friends :(.,"Not sure where to post this but just gotta get some advice and vent a bit. Not interested in online friends.

 I'm a guy 20 years old, in college right now. I had friends as a kid but I moved states when i was 14/15 and lost all my friends. Since then i have literally not had a single real friend. I do somehow have a girlfriend tho and I am blessed to have her. She is my best friend but I have no one else. And right now we're doing long distance because I'm at college so I don't see her anymore besides phone calls which we don't get to do often enough, and it's not the same as real connection. Im in my second semester at a 4 year college as a transfer.

Anyway I had an interaction earlier that made me realize how much I avoid people and how it really is my fault. Guy in my class was very nice and invited me to grab food in the dining hall between lecture and lab. I was like no thanks im full. I feel like i could tell he felt bad but i just left and was like ""cya later"", when i could've said yes and at least got a coffee and worked on our assignment together. I feel like he  wont ask me again. I didnt realize till after the fact that I should've just said yes. Because I always complain about feeling alone and stuff but when opportunities are there for me i turn them down and avoid people and I don't know why. Situations like this happen to me often. 

It's kinda weird because I havent had friends for a while and I've been perfectly fine and content, but lately I've been craving some kind of connection and friednship, but I just like find ir really hard to talk to epople. I used to think I don't need anyone but I think people with friends are probably happier and life is better for them. But at the same time I feel like I just don't have very much to say and I prefer to keep to myself honestly. Maybe it's the extremely social college I'm at right now that's just making me feel left out and different. 

Anyway, I think I should make friends as I haven't had any for years. I don't even know how to have a friend at this point or what friends do or talk about or anything. But how should I go about trying to make new friends? Thanks.

So I gotta tell you about my relationship with BetOnline. And I say ""relationship"" because that's what it is. It's dysfunctional as hell, it's cost me everything, and I keep going back because I'm an idiot with a gambling problem and the memory of a goldfish.

I'm a VIP Platinum Level 2 member. Now, for those of you who don't gamble online, let me explain what that actually means in real terms.

It means I've given these people FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS.

Half. A. Million. Dollars.

I know what you're thinking. ""That can't be right. Nobody's that stupid.""

Oh buddy, strap in. We're just getting started.

That's not ""whoops I got carried away on a Tuesday"" money. That's a HOUSE. That's a really nice house. That's my retirement. That's my kid's college fund AND his first car. That's ""I could've bought a Lamborghini and crashed it into a tree and I'd STILL have been better off financially"" money.

But instead of any of those things, what do I have? I have a little digital badge next to my username that says ""VIP Platinum Level 2,"" which is just corporate speak for ""Holy shit, this guy has a serious problem but let's keep this gravy train rolling.""

Part Two: The Slow Descent Into Madness

So I'm playing this game called Wheels and Reels XL. And if you've never played online slots, let me explain what it's like.

It's like trying to win your ex-girlfriend back. You keep putting in effort, you keep spending money, and every once in a while she smiles at you and you go ""SEE? SHE STILL LOVES ME!"" But she doesn't. She's just keeping you around because you keep buying her drinks.

That's what the bonus round is. It's the smile. It's the thing that makes you think ""okay, THIS is why I've been doing this.""

And I've been chasing this bonus round like it owes me money. Which, technically, after $500,000, it kinda does.

Earlier that day, I'm trying to play some of the newer games and they won't even load. They just sit there spinning like a drunk trying to remember where he parked. So I contact support and this guy Oliver—and Oliver's actually a good dude, this isn't about him—he basically tells me ""Yeah man, some of our new games are screwed up. Too graphics-heavy or something. Just stick to your regular games.""

And I'm like, ""Okay, that's weird that you're just admitting your shit's broken, but alright. I'll go back to Wheels and Reels XL. That's my game. That one's never had issues.""

Oh, past me. You sweet, naive, financially irresponsible idiot.

Part Three: The Moment Everything Goes To Shit

So I'm grinding away on Wheels and Reels XL. And when I say grinding, I mean I'm playing this thing like it's my JOB. Thousands of spins. Thousands of dollars. My thumb hurts from hitting the spin button. I'm pretty sure I've developed carpal tunnel from gambling, which feels like it should be impossible but here we are.

And then it happens.

THE BONUS HITS.

The screen lights up like the Fourth of July. There's music. There's animations. I'm pretty sure I heard angels singing, but that might've been the slot machine or a stroke, I'm not sure.

The bonus wheel appears on my screen. Right there. Clear as day. This is it. This is what I've been waiting for. This is what $500,000 of bad decisions has led to.

I'm about to spin the wheel and—

THE GAME CRASHES.

Just completely shits the bed. Dies. Freezes. The whole thing just goes ""nope"" and quits.

And I'm sitting there staring at my phone like it just told me my dog died.

Now here's the thing. I've had games crash before. It happens. You reload it, and because these games are supposedly fair and regulated and all that happy horseshit, it takes you RIGHT back to where you were. It's like a save point in a video game. ""Don't worry, buddy, we got you. Here's your bonus round.""

So I reload the game. And I spin ONCE, thinking it's gonna load me right back into that bonus sequence like it always does.

IT DOESN'T.

The bonus is just... gone. Vanished. Disappeared into the ether like my financial stability and my family's respect.

Part Four: Customer Service Roulette (And I Don't Mean The Game)

So I immediately contact support. Because that's what you're supposed to do, right? You report it right away. You don't wait. You don't screw around. You document everything because you're not an idiot.

(Narrator: He was, in fact, an idiot, but not about this.)

First agent? Ends the chat on me. Just straight up disconnects. Which is AMAZING because their CHAT SYSTEM works perfectly fine. It's just the GAMES THAT OWE ME MONEY that have technical difficulties.

Second time, I get Robin Henderson. And look, Robin's just doing her job. I'm not mad at Robin personally. But Robin becomes the face of this entire shitshow, so Robin, if you're reading this, I'm sorry but you're about to be a character in my villain origin story.

I explain the whole situation. I'm polite. I'm clear. I even apologize for using speech-to-text because my Southern accent makes me sound like a hillbilly having a medical emergency. I'm TRYING here.

But Robin keeps asking me for the ""hand ID."" That's the transaction number that proves the round happened.

And I'm like, ""Robin. ROBIN. The game CRASHED. That's the PROBLEM. There IS no hand ID because the round never COMPLETED.""

That's like a cop asking a robbery victim for the receipt from the robbery. ""Well sir, if you can't show me paperwork proving you were robbed, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do.""

Part Five: The Two Dollar Insult

So Robin goes away to ""review my account."" And she comes back with this absolute gem:

""I don't see any issues in our system, but as an EXCEPTION, I'll refund your $2 bet.""

Two. Fucking. Dollars.

Let me put this in perspective for you.

I have given this company $500,000. I've literally paid someone's SALARY at this company. I've probably funded their health insurance. I might've paid for the office Christmas party. Hell, I might've paid for Robin's CAR.

And the resolution to a crashed bonus round is two dollars.

That's not even a combo meal at McDonald's. That's not even a GOOD coffee. That's the change you find in your couch and think ""oh cool, free money"" before immediately forgetting about it.

I've spent half a million dollars with these people and we're having a legitimate corporate discussion about whether I deserve MORE than two dollars.

Part Six: The Negotiation (If You Can Call It That)

So I try to explain, calmly, that I'm not asking for the jackpot. I'm not asking them to guess what I would've won. I'm asking for the MINIMUM the bonus wheel pays out.

Based on a $2 bet, that's about $10.

Ten. Dollars.

Let me do the math for you because I've clearly demonstrated I'm not good at math, but I can handle this one:

$10 is 0.002% of what I've spent with them.

0.002%.

If you took $10 from them right now, they wouldn't even NOTICE. It wouldn't register. Their accountant would look at that and go ""huh, must be a rounding error.""

But for me? It's the PRINCIPLE. It's about whether this company gives a single shit about fairness when it comes to a customer who's given them enough money to BUY A HOUSE.

And Robin—sweet, corporate-scripted Robin—keeps saying ""I don't see any disconnection in our records.""

Right. Because if BetOnline's servers don't log it, it didn't happen. It's like the tree falling in the forest, except the tree is my money and the forest is a rigged slot machine.

Part Seven: The Troubleshooting Insult

And THEN—and this is my favorite part—Robin suggests I ""restart my device and check my internet connection.""

Let me be very clear about something:

MY INTERNET WAS FINE.

Netflix? Working perfectly. YouTube? Flawless. Instagram? Scrolling like butter. I could've livestreamed the whole thing in 4K if I wanted to.

Everything else on my phone worked PERFECTLY. It was YOUR GAME, on YOUR SERVERS, with YOUR admitted technical problems, that decided to take a shit at the EXACT moment it owed me money.

But sure, Robin. I'll restart my phone. Maybe that'll make the bonus round magically reappear like my self-respect.

Part Eight: The Philosophy Hour

Here's what kills me about this whole thing.

They ADMITTED earlier in the day that their games were having problems. Oliver straight up told me ""yeah, some games are broken, stick to your regular ones.""

So I DID. I went back to Wheels and Reels XL, my ""safe"" game, the one I've played a thousand times. And it STILL crashed at the EXACT WORST POSSIBLE MOMENT.

It's like if your mechanic said ""hey, your brakes are acting weird, maybe avoid the highway,"" so you stick to back roads, and then your brakes FAIL ANYWAY, and when you call him he's like ""I don't see any record of brake failure. Here's two dollars for the emotional distress.""

And then he suggests you check your tire pressure.

Part Nine: The Principle of the Thing

Look, I know how this sounds. ""Boohoo, the degenerate gambler with half a million dollars in losses is crying about ten bucks.""

And you're right. I have a gambling problem. I KNOW I have a gambling problem. You don't reach VIP Platinum Level 2 by making sound financial decisions. You don't spend $500,000 on online slot machines because you're smart with money.

If I was smart with money, I'd be on a beach somewhere drinking mai tais. Instead, I'm here writing a manifesto about a $10 bonus round.

But this isn't about the ten dollars anymore. This isn't even about ME.

This is about the fact that if they can do this to a guy who's given them HALF A MILLION DOLLARS, they can do it to ANYBODY.

Think about that.

I'm VIP Platinum Level 2. I'm in the top tier of their customer base. I've been playing with them for YEARS. I've lost more money than most people will make in a decade. I've been LOYAL—and by loyal I mean addicted, but corporate likes the word ""loyal"" better.

And when their system screws up and eats a bonus round, they can't even make it right for TEN DOLLARS.

So what chance do you have? If you're just a regular player who deposited $50 for fun, and this happens to you, what do you think they're gonna do?

I'll tell you what they're gonna do: They're gonna give you two dollars and tell you to restart your device.

Part Ten: The Things I Could've Bought Instead

You know what I could've bought with $500,000?

A house. A really nice house. Maybe two houses if I wasn't picky.

A Lamborghini. A few of them, actually.

My kid's entire college education at a GOOD school.

A small business that might've actually made money.

Literally anything else that wouldn't have disappeared into the digital void.

But no. I gave it to an online casino. And you know what? That's on me. I made those decisions. I clicked that button. I own that.

But when I FINALLY hit a bonus—the thing the ENTIRE GAME is designed around—and their system crashes and eats it, the LEAST they could do is make it right.

The absolute BARE MINIMUM they could do is say ""hey, our system screwed up, here's the minimum payout for that bonus round.""

Instead, they gave me two dollars and suggested I check my internet connection.

Part Eleven: The Final Conversation

So after going back and forth for what feels like an eternity, Robin finally asks:

""What specifically would you like us to do?""

And I'm thinking ""oh good, we're finally getting somewhere. They're ready to actually fix this.""

So I explain, AGAIN, that I want compensation equal to the minimum bonus value. About ten dollars. The price of lunch. A cheap lunch. A lunch you'd eat and think ""well, that was food.""

Robin asks what that amount would be.

I tell her: ten dollars.

And you know what Robin says?

""I am sorry we are not able to credit any possible win on the bonus round. I have already added the $2 to your account.""

Just... deposits two dollars like child support from a deadbeat dad and calls it a day.

Part Twelve: The Warning

So let me be very clear about why I'm writing this novel-length Reddit post instead of just moving on with my life like a normal person:

This is a warning.

If you're playing on BetOnline—or ANY online casino, really—you need to understand something:

When you hit that bonus round, you better pray to every god you can think of that their system doesn't hiccup. Because if it does, and that bonus disappears, you're shit out of luck.

Take screenshots. Record videos. Get it notarized. Hire a lawyer to watch you play. I don't know. But DO SOMETHING, because if their server doesn't feel like logging it, it didn't happen.

And if you're thinking ""well, they'll make it right, I'm a VIP member""—no. They won't.

I'm VIP PLATINUM LEVEL 2. I've given them $500,000. And they fought me over ten dollars.

TEN. DOLLARS.

If they'll do that to me, they'll do it to you without even blinking.

Part Thirteen: The Stuff That Actually Matters

Here's the thing that really bothers me about all this.

I've won before. I've had payouts. They've never had a problem paying me when I win legitimately. This isn't about them being a scam or refusing to pay winners or anything like that.

This is about what happens when their SYSTEM fails and YOU get screwed.

Because when everything works, great. The money goes in, the money (occasionally) comes out, everybody's happy.

But when their system glitches and eats a triggered bonus round—something that should be LOGGED and DOCUMENTED because this is supposed to be a REGULATED GAMBLING PLATFORM—they just shrug and go ""we don't see anything, here's two dollars, have you tried turning it off and on again?""

That's not okay.

That's not how you treat someone who's given you half a million dollars.

Hell, that's not how you treat someone who's given you FIVE dollars.

The Conclusion: What I Actually Want

So if anyone from BetOnline is reading this—and I hope you are—here's what I want:

I want the ten dollar minimum bonus credit that your game owed me before it crashed.

That's it.

I'm not asking for a jackpot. I'm not asking for thousands of dollars. I'm not even asking for an apology, although that would be nice.

I just want the minimum payout for a bonus round that YOUR SYSTEM crashed during.

I've given you $500,000. I've been loyal—or addicted, depending on your perspective. I've never cheated. I've never scammed. I've played by every single rule you've set.

And I'm asking for ten dollars.

If you can't honor that, then what the hell are we even doing here?

TL;DR: I'm VIP Platinum Level 2 on BetOnline, which means I've spent $500,000—yes, HALF A MILLION DOLLARS—on their site. I finally hit a bonus round on Wheels and Reels XL. The game crashed before it paid out. Their response: ""We don't see any record of this, here's your $2 bet back."" They won't honor a $10 minimum bonus payout even though they admitted earlier that day they were having technical problems with games. I've literally funded someone's salary at this company and they're fighting me over ten bucks. If they'll do this to a $500K VIP customer, they'll do it to anyone. This is your warning.

P.S. - BetOnline, I'm the guy who's kept your lights on. I've paid someone's mortgage at your company. I've been as loyal as a dog who keeps getting kicked but comes back anyway because he's too stupid to leave. Make this right. It's ten dollars. You've taken $500,000 from me. Ten. Dollars.",2,1768943989.0,OnlineBetting,2,1.0,False
1qidwbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qidwbo/my_28f_bf_25m_refuses_to_plan_dates/,My [28f] bf [25m] refuses to plan dates,"We have been dating for 2.5 years and a a big point of contention in our relationship is that I think my bf is not a thoughtful person. I think he is nice and a good person, but likely because of his upbringing he doesn’t show care in the way that I am used to or expect from a romantic relationship. I believe that understanding a person and seeing them for who they are and showing that you remember things about them (what they like to eat, types of music/shows/movies they like, what kinds of activities they enjoy) and showing that you know and remember is a big way to show that you care. My bf argues that he can’t remember those things because his brain is not wired like that, and he can only remember things if I explicitly tell him. In my mind these are things you can (and should?) observe about your partner, and a lack in doing so shows lack of care. 

In the 2.5 years we have been together we have discussed this a lot and I believe him when he says his way of showing care just isn’t the same as mine. On the flip side, I also think that when I show care to him by remembering details about him and manifesting them in actions (getting food he likes, suggesting activities he might be into), it is not received as a form of care/love. He insists that if I like a food or an activity I should explicitly tell him and he is more than happy to oblige.

My problem is that I feel like I am asking for things but I want to feel like he wants to do these things, even if it is just for my sake. I’d like him to walk past a bakery and remember the pastries I like, and bring some home because he thinks I might enjoy them. Without me asking. Or he should notice that there are some new arts/crafts or bookstores opening near us and suggest that we stop by because it’s something I might like. His view is that if I want those things I should just say it.

Another problem that manifests is my desire for dates. I would like my bf to plan dates for us to go on, like pick a restaurant and activity that both of us might enjoy and surprise me with it. He says he hates surprises and he would rather we just plan the date together. This is the part where I feel hurt because I feel like the exercise of him thinking about what we could do for a date is how he can show his thoughtfulness, but he refuses to do it because it hurts his brain. I have explicitly asked for paint and sip dates/coffee shop dates, but he wants me to specify the time and location for us to do it. I feel like this is all very not romantic, and my bf is not a romantic person.

He says that it hurts his brain to plan dates and he would much much more prefer for us to just plan everything together. He himself does not like surprises. But my view is that he can not like surprises but still plan surprises for me because I expressed that it makes me feel loved and cared for.

At the end of the day he is still a nice person. He had a very good and sheltered upbringing and his parents who I’ve met several times are very normal and nice as well. But maybe he just didn’t grow up learning that understanding and seeing others is way to show care and love. I know he loves his parents and siblings but when I ask him what their favorite ice cream flavors are he says he doesn’t know. And that just baffles me. He is generous, patient, good at listening, but not thoughtful. He does listen to what I say about all of the above but he just disagrees and can only “try to change”.  He generally never gets upset at me or expresses any anger; he is always happy and sometimes sad when I get upset or angry at him.

TLDR; I feel disappointed that my bf says he is not capable of being thoughtful because that just isn’t how his brain works. I believe he is a good person with good intentions and he does care but the fact that he can’t (or won’t) care in the ways I asked for makes me sad.",1,1768943974.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

Yesterday, I woke up early with a stabbing, numbing pain above my left brow bone. I decided to try to sleep it off and wake up when I normally do. When I woke up again, it was still there. I went to the bathroom, and when I got up it was a lot of pressure and pain on and above my left eye. I drank a lot of water and went back to sleep. After I woke up at 11, it was still there. I took Tylenol and just stayed in bed most of the day, suffering every time I got up, but as long as I didn't stand for long, the pain lessened but was still present. I lay for most of the day and was okay, but moving my head meant pressure on my eye or at the back of my head.  
This morning, I woke up with the terrible pain again. Seems to be worse in the morning. Got up for the bathroom, had terrible pain on and above my eye. It hurt really badly when I yawned too. I asked my anesthetist sister for help, and she told me to take naproxen, tylenol, and drink coffee. Afterwards, I felt much better. still felt a little pressure whenever I got up, but no pain, just discomfort. 3 hours later, my head pain started to return, so I drank more coffee. Less pain again!   
I don't drink coffee regularly, maybe once every couple of weeks, so it's not withdrawal-related.

I enjoy musing about the mysteries of the universe so maybe I have primed myself somehow, but something has happened and I don’t know if this is a glitch or a parallel universe or some sort of walk-in or what but I’m a little bit freaked out. I most everything about my life and my surroundings seem the same, but something in me has definitely shifted. Could it be an upgrade? I don’t know but over the last few days I’ve become really into cooking - have made meals organized my pantry and enlisted AI to do a nutritional assessment of my current diet and where to improve… while I don’t spontaneously know recipes I was able to look at everything I have and come up with multiple meals to make and then had to look up the  recipes … I have never been much of a cook, nor wanted to learn beyond basics and while I eat pretty well, I definitely eat for fuel. Very casually, automatically, not in a frenzy, I have organized my kitchen cabinets, fridge, pantry, even where the coffee maker sits.. and come up with things to make using a kitchen more feasible from someplace I didn’t even know existed in myself.  

Also, suddenly, I have very little interest in watching television at all, even new seasons of shows that I’ve traditionally watched. I get bored immediately, I can’t get into a sitcom. I don’t enjoy spy thrillers. I’m more drawn to watching kitchen shows about cooking  or researching things on line, largely around food chemistry and nutrition.

A while back, I shared our ""Devolio"" template here. Long story short: we tried to get it on the Framer Marketplace, got rejected for some layout/contrast issues, and decided to pivot hard.

Instead of just tweaking it, we overhauled the whole vibe. We moved away from the basic terminal look to a distinct **Retro Cyber Brutalism** aesthetic. We wanted something that felt raw, industrial, and ""OS-like"" but still usable for devs.

**What’s under the hood:**

* **The Vibe:** High-contrast, industrial, strictly developer-focused.
* **Console Drop Nav:** Built a custom mobile overlay with a heavy spring open / instant zip close. It feels mechanical.
* **Smoother Motion:** Cleaned up the animation curves and added ""Ghost"" layers so the closing transitions don't snap awkwardly.

1qidt4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_collegehub/comments/1qidt4d/budgeting_tips_for_students_heading_into_spring/,💸 Budgeting tips for students heading into spring (without feeling broke all semester),"Starting or coming back for spring usually brings a mix of motivation and money stress. Tuition hits, books cost more than expected, and suddenly every purchase feels louder. The goal of budgeting isn’t to be perfect or miserable — it’s to keep money from becoming the thing that derails your semester. A little clarity now goes a long way once classes get busy.

Here’s how students realistically plan their money for spring.

**🧠 Start with real numbers, not guesses**

Before you try to “budget,” look at what spring actually costs you. Tuition, fees, books, housing, food, transportation, subscriptions, and random expenses all count.

The biggest mistake is underestimating the small stuff — coffee runs, delivery, rides, campus snacks. Individually they feel harmless, but together they can quietly wreck a budget. Knowing the real picture upfront makes every other decision easier.

**💰 Be honest about what money is coming in**

Next, list your actual income. That might include financial aid refunds, a part-time job, work-study, family support, or savings.

Only count money you know you’ll receive. Don’t build your plan around “maybe” money. If extra cash shows up later, that’s a bonus — not something you’re already depending on.

**📊 Give your money simple categories**

Budgets don’t need to be complicated. Most students do fine with a few clear buckets: tuition, housing, food, transportation, books, and personal spending.

When every dollar has a job, you’re less likely to overspend early and panic later. This isn’t about restriction — it’s about awareness.

**🍔 Plan food before the semester gets chaotic**

Food is where budgets usually leak the fastest. Having even a loose plan helps a lot.

Some students save money by cooking a few staple meals each week. Others rely on meal plans, campus food spots, or keeping easy snacks around to avoid impulse spending between classes. The goal isn’t perfection — it’s fewer last-minute decisions that cost more than expected.

**📚 Cut textbook costs aggressively**

Buying every book new is almost never necessary. Look into rentals, digital versions, older editions, library copies, or classmates who already took the class.

It’s also okay to wait a few days after classes start. Professors often clarify which books are actually required versus “recommended,” and that alone can save you money.

**🚍 Don’t forget transportation costs**

Gas, parking, transit passes, ride shares — these add up fast. Estimate weekly transportation costs instead of guessing.

If you live close to campus, walking, biking, or using student transit perks can free up more money over the semester than you’d expect.

**🧾 Build in a small buffer**

Spring always comes with surprise expenses — lab fees, software, printing, club dues, or just life stuff.

Even a small cushion in your budget helps keep one unexpected cost from turning into full-blown stress. You don’t need a huge emergency fund — just enough breathing room.

**🔁 Do quick check-ins instead of ignoring it**

Budgets work best when you actually look at them. Once a week or every two weeks, check your spending and adjust if needed.

If something feels tight, tweak it. Budgeting isn’t about “failing” — it’s about staying flexible so money doesn’t control your semester.

>**TL;DR: Budgeting for spring works best when you start with real costs, know your actual income, keep categories simple, plan food and books ahead, account for transportation, and leave room for surprises. Small check-ins help you stay in control instead of stressed once classes get busy.**

>**Do you usually plan your budget before the semester starts or figure it out as you go? And what expense always seems to throw things off halfway through spring?**",1,1768943780.0,u_collegehub,0,1.0,False

# zuppa extra lunga

1. One Aeropress filter in the bottom, spritzed with water (to help it stick and hopefully aid with puck saturation)
2. 22 g of coffee, ground medium-coarse (\~670 µm, 2.0.0 on a Timemore C3 ESP Pro), tamped
3. Another Aeropress filter on top, spritzed with water and tamped again
4. 220 ml of less-than-boiling water (aiming for \~95 °C, but not measured)
5. Some coffee immediately starts dripping through.
6. Screw pump on, briefly tilt brewer to the side. Then tap, tap, tap the entire brewer on the counter, both done to aid puck infusion.
7. Slowly push water through until the stock carafe is almost full.
8. Set brewer aside and decant carafe.
9. Put brewer back on the stock carafe and add another 140 ml of hot water.
10. Screw pump back on and push everything through, through multiple hisses.

Then I tasted from both carafes separately:

The 1st (which yielded 188 g from the 220 g put in) had nicely balanced sweetness and acidity, but perhaps a touch too much of that “Aeropress intensity” that’s usually a bit too much for me.

The 2nd (which yielded 149 g from the 140 g put in; more because much of the water trapped in the puck came out when pushing through 2–3 hisses) was much more tea-like and quite pleasant in its own right, with perhaps just a touch of that “hollow” taste of under-extraction.

Mixed back together (at roughly equal parts), it’s the best hot brew I’ve gotten from an ORB.

I’d say that adding the second carafe of (weaker) coffee yielded a significantly better result than diluting with just water.

So I’ll think this will be my starting point from now on for 1:16.7-strength coffee from the ORB. 

The only modification I’ll make is to split the two brews into equal parts of around 180 ml, because brewing 220 ml for the first brew is just too iffy. (I’ll usually overshoot my target weights by a few grams, so I should end up with the desired 1:1.67 ratio, which would ideally mean adding 367 ml of water.)",7,1768943773.0,OXORapidBrewer,1,0.82,False

My mom (58F) just left after a month-long visit from Brazil, and I'm struggling to process what this visit revealed about our relationship. My husband is furious about how she treated me and wants to set hard boundaries or cancel her next visit to see our baby entirely.

Quick background: She physically disciplined me as a child, and constantly minimizes it when I try to talk about it. She also did not protect me when her partner sexually harassed me as a teenager. I've spent years rationalizing this due to culture, her upbringing, and the idea that she ""did her best."" This visit forced me to stop rationalizing.

During her stay, she repeatedly:

• Criticized our house despite being warned in advance it wouldn't be utterly clean because I'm pregnant and exhausted and my husband has a lot going on at work

• Used possessive language about my daughter (“my baby”) and resisted correction

• Lied about small, observable things (saying she washed knives when she only wiped them, denying actions I directly witnessed and had proof on our Ring camera)

• Repeatedly violated basic food safety (tasting raw chicken seasoning, touching raw meat then cabinets without washing hands), and dismissed concerns as us being ""too much""

• Spilled coffee on our couch while playing with her mug and laughed when I pointed out her behavior 

• Treated our home as hers, calling the guest room

""my bedroom,"" appliances ""my machine,"" and leaving over 80 Ibs of belongings behind saying she will take with her in her next visit 

She never apologizes. There is no accountability. Only excuses, deflection, or portraying herself as the victim. She refuses to acknowledge the physical abuse or her partner's behavior, even when confronted calmly.

The current problem is that she plans to return in two months for two weeks around the birth to ""help."" I already don't trust her with boundaries or food safety, so I'm planning to cook and freeze over 80 meals in advance to avoid her cooking around a newborn. That doesn't feel like help.

Here’s where I need some help:

Am I overreacting? Is it acceptable to want distance even with a baby coming? How do you set boundaries with a parent like this without emotionally collapsing?

TL;DR: My mom's visit exposed chronic lying, boundary violations, and refusal to acknowledge past abuse. She plans to return when my baby is born.

I was so scared and even pushed back my start date a few times because I couldn't get myself to go in.I wouldn't consider myself extremely depressed and wasn't sure if Spravato was right for me but decided I'd give it a go. 

Im on my third dose and I am blown away at how much it has helped. I feel like my anxiety has gone down tremendously, I've been able to look people in the eye again and have a real conversation without wanting to run away. I also have had motivation to do things again, simple things even like putting away laundry or cleaning my house. It's helped with my memory, I can think clearly now and remember things I used to struggle with. 

For anyone scared or feeling nervous about trying it, here are some tips that have helped me a ton:   
1. You do get a pretty strong high when you take it, but bring some bluetooth headphones and look up the ""Spravato and Chill"" playlist on Spotify. I haven't had any visual hallucinations while on it but the audible ones feel so good. I like to think about the things I love while on the trip along with the things I want to change. 2 hours in a chair gives you plenty of time to reflect on what you want out of it. 

2. I've completely given up alcohol and THC afters starting Spravato. I've also started cutting coffee down to once or twice a week instead of daily. Something about how Spravato makes me feel has me wanting to continue getting better versus when I was on Prozac or Lexapro. Make the lifestyle changes and let it work for you. 

3. DEFINITLEY bring a lollipop or something sweet to suck on lol the taste is so bad but does go away pretty quickly. 

4. I haven't had any nausea or side effects from it but im still early on. Like others have said, avoid eating 2-3 hours before your appointment. 

  
I just wanted to share this in case anyone else was curious or interested in trying it out. I stalked these forums for months before making the jump and loved all of the first hand info. ",9,1768943586.0,Spravato,8,1.0,False

The department I work at is construction related where there are about five women, majority are clerk or accounting positions. Anyway we had a lot of ppl retire and new ppl got hire. The issue is the new drama that arose. To keep things easy Tammi 60(F) has worked in the department for over 15 years. Kate 55(F) replaced a recent retire person but has experience in accounting in various other departments. Lucy 57(f) recently took a position of a promoted employee and she was an outside hire.

Drama was kinda normal but everyone dealt with each other “unique” personalities. 

Kate was hired then Lucy. Well Lucy came in and didn't want to be train at all. Now if this was a coffee job… maybe? But she had no previous experience with government work and there's a special computer program. Instead of the other clerks/ accountants putting their foot down they let her “figure it out”. Holding she would come and ask for help. She rarely did and when the other ladies try to give advice, it wasn't really welcomed. 

In Lucy eyes Tammi and Kate have been whispering about her and she have given multiply chances to the ladies and was even going to give them Christmas presents but returned them and told me in confidence. The reason?  Well one situation was over a computer monitor. A new hire was coming and Lucy wanted to take the two monitors to her desk and Kate claimed that the new person needs her monitor and if anything she would need a third. Lucy took offense bc she saw it as, Kate wasn't looking at for her and as a superior she should have known that we could order more. So that was the last straw for Kate. And for Tammi, she feels that she is holding back on information and avoiding her. Lucy said she is done w the high school drama. I've asked her many times to talk to them to clear things without giving away details that I was told in confident. And I did tell Lucy that I'm not in this drama that they need to talk. But she refuses. 

Kate and Tammi both are confused and surprised that anyone would get a job and refuse to get training especially when it's a program that is known to need people to train others on. They both claimed they try talking to her and teaching her but Lucy always comes off like a know it all or brushes them off. I always play devils advocate but even some things I can't defend and the same thing I say to Lucy I tell them. Talk to her. Kate and Tammi tried but they said it's like a brick wall. I even told them to have a conversation w the big boss but they didn't want to. Unfortunately Lucy has made mistakes with her work and even sent emails to people you shouldn't get involved making the whole department look crazy as if we don't talk to one another. 

I am trying to plan a bonding and Lucy refuses to go due to Tammi and Kate. 

Now I'm not saying Kate and Tammi are innocent but they were venting to one another regarding the situation and trying to figure out how to work around Lucy demand despite it being abnormal. 

I spoke to my mom and she told me this drama stuff happens. 

But would I be the a whole to snitch to my boss about the drama in hopes to clear all the drama and rumors and he said she said. Or am I out of line and should mind my business. Lol. I just hate the weird tension.  ",0,1768943432.0,AITAH,3,0.5,False

Amigos cafeístas, esse café é um absurdo!

Vibrante, brilhante, estimulante... É difícil descrevê-lo sem apelar para superlativos e exageros emocionados.

Os aromas são intensos e saltam da xícara. Você não precisa fazer esforço algum para perceber as notas sensoriais, que são um espetáculo. O que mais sinto é o licor de rosas, mas muito integrado com o frescor da amora. Em segundo plano, uma base frutada e tropical que não consigo identificar (talvez seja o que o pacote identifica como manga).

Na boca, esse café é uma festa! Parece que estão soltando fogos de artifício na sua boca (tipo aqueles pozinhos que explodem na boca). O que me traz essa sensação é um gosto quase artificial, do tipo que você sente em xarope de flores tipo Monin, somado à acidez que é muito presente (dando a sensação de gengibre e limão).

A acidez é acompanhada pelo dulçor e corpo muito presentes, na medida certa, sem sobrecarregar demais - lembrando o dulçor de geléia ou xarope de amora. O resultado é uma xícara muito suculenta, que tende a ser licorosa, mas preserva muito a leveza (meio inexplicável). A finalização é longa e deixa a boca salivando por muito tempo (juro, tem 30 minutos que terminei e ainda estou salivando e sentindo os cantos da boca).

São cafés desse nível que me fazem entender o significado de ""layered""... são tantas camadas, sensações, aromas e sabores, que você fica meio eletrizado e estimulado. Dá vontade de dançar ou de correr pra debaixo da mesa tipo a Ana Maria Braga. Pqp!

I met a woman in her mid-40s on Tinder. She’s poly and married, and she says her and her husband are completely on the same page. She told me she hasn’t been sexually active with her husband and that her last sexual encounter with anyone was back in 2021. She’s interested in a casual FWB situation with me.

I asked about STI testing. She sent me results showing:

HIV test from 2021 (negative)

Gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis tests from 2023 (all negative)

We met once, had coffee, kissed, and planned a date to have sex. Before that, I asked if she’d be willing to do a new STI panel just for peace of mind. She said she doesn’t think it’s necessary since she hasn’t been sexually active for years, and also mentioned testing can be expensive.

Logically, I know the risk is probably low, especially with condoms, but I can’t shake this uneasy feeling that I don’t fully trust the situation. I don’t know if this is just anxiety because I’m inexperienced, or if it’s my intuition telling me to slow down or bail.",8,1768943279.0,nonmonogamy,19,1.0,False

Do you notice a difference in increased effectiveness for depression if you don’t drink coffee?,"I came across a study the other day that said that skipping coffee (or any form of caffeine) on the day of your ketamine infusion results in better outcomes for those seeking the ketamine for depression. I’m thinking about trying it out this week for my infusion and skipping drinking coffee in the morning, which will probably be pretty difficult for me since I am not a morning person. 

I have been getting infusion for a long time now, so I am quite experienced with ketamine, and it has saved my life. Even the most difficult experiences have had benefits for my depression. I do drink coffee daily (only one cup, and only in the morning) and usually do so about 4-5 hours before my infusion. I don’t know how some of you are getting infusions at 8-9 AM…  personally, I tend to schedule mine around noon-2 pm. I’d feel way too chaotic if I went in for an infusion first thing in the morning when I’m rushing through my day. I didn’t realize that I could be jeopardizing the benefits for treating my depression by having caffeine in the morning. 

Has anyone noticed a difference in effectiveness of their infusions when they do/don’t have caffeine? My last few infusions have been really intense, so I’m not necessarily looking for my intensity, but I do wonder if I’ll feel less anxious if I skip it this time. 

Any experiences from those of you who tested infusions with/without caffeine would be appreciated. ",2,1768943255.0,TherapeuticKetamine,9,1.0,False
1qidke7,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1qidke7/hand_working_jobs_with_a_high_ceiling/,Hand working jobs with a high ceiling?,"My first job at 10 years old was landscaping. My grandfather paid me $5/hr to pull weeds, mow lawns, pressure wash shingles, rake, and burn brush. It was fine. It was good to be outside during the summers. My second job, one with a W-2, came when I was 14; I fixed bicycles. That job was great; I loved the work, I loved working with my hands. But the pay did top out at  about $25/hr, which I was making when I was 20. My next job was serving tables, and it was just fine. I love talking to people and I'm a happy worker when it comes to the technicalities of doing a job well; timing, setting things properly, informing people of the menu, making everything ""as it should be."" But the nature of serving tables is, by design, frustrating. Many small injustices pile up all at once-- I, as a server, am responsible for food coming out on time even when the kitchen is behind. I am responsible for setting tables correctly even when we run out of clean dinnerware. I lose money for not being personally appealing to very difficult guests. I lose money when I try to do virtuous things like spend extra time navigating obstacles with guests that have dietary restrictions, or problems with their drinks, etc. Nothing like being in the weeds and someone needs you to remake their drink a third time in a row because they didn't like it, and I have to smile and feign obsequiosity, lest I lose money on that table. I do well as a server, better than many of my peers, but the small injustices get to me, and the fact that they affect my wallet, makes the job tiresome. I have also done construction, which was fine, HVAC, which was not desireable (I will never sacrifice that much sleep and bodily health for money again), demolition/recycling, expediting, dish washing, making coffee, and jewelry making. Of everything I've done, fixing bicycles and making jewelry have been the most personally fulfilling and rewarding. My natural aptitudes are attention to detail, focus, effort, and quick learning *when the task is interesting*. Unfortunately, fixing bicycles and making jewelry have about the same ceiling of pay, which is too little to support me in the current economy. 

Academically, I finished highschool and never went to college. I faced and still find myself facing analysis paralysis when it comes to picking something to commit time and money to. The feedback that I most frequently receive from my superiors in the workplace are praise for my good people skills, my capability to do all things when I apply myself fully, and my capacity to learn. I would love to go to college at some point (I am 25 now), but I still haven't a clue what to pursue. 

The aspects of working on bicycles and making jewelry that made them so rewarding to me, I believe, included the fact that there was such a high ceiling for skill development (for jewelry, I would say the ceiling is limitless) and the fact that I could learn and apply *best practices* to all things I do. I love to make things ""correct."" Jewelry I find even more rewarding, because once one knows best practices for, say, setting a stone that will stay tight, or fabricating prongs so they will not snap, the ceiling raises-- now I can apply those learnings to novel types of settings, use the same principles to come up with my own designs and ways of doing things, and know that the pieces I make will be structurally sound and last a lifetime. I like being a master of my craft. I love being creative. I love interacting with people. I love applying myself to things that are interesting. What can I look into doing that fits the criteria of creativity, high skill ceilings, hand working, interacting with people, and following best practices, especially on projects that require precision and talent?",1,1768943254.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

1qidiki,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qidiki/aio_about_my_boyfriends_behaviour_on_my_birthday/,AIO about my boyfriend's behaviour on my birthday?,"Long-time lurker, first time poster, so this is a throw-away account.

After looking at some of the things posted on here, I feel like this issue is very minor in comparison, and maybe I'm too old to be caring about birthdays anymore, but I am upset nonetheless and I would like some advice and perspective if any kind strangers are willing to lend their time.

I am feeling disappointed and sad after my recent birthday, and I’m struggling to tell if I’m being unreasonable or if my feelings are valid.

For some background: My boyfriend and I (both 29 yo) have been together for two years. We have only recently started living together.

I know birthdays are kind of a “made up” day to be nice to someone, but in my family they were always treated as a special day where the person is really celebrated and made to feel loved. I don’t care about big parties or expensive gifts, but I *do* really value a little bit of thoughtfulness and effort from the people I’m closest to. It doesn't have to be much - acts of service like offering me a tea/coffee when I wake up, making breakfast or going out for food, a thoughtful card, planning a little surprise activity or adventure for us to do together. For me, a birthday is an excuse to go a little “above and beyond” what you’d normally do for someone on an average day — even if that just means planning something small but intentional.

I always try to do this for the people I love. For example, for my boyfriend’s birthday last year, we happened to be in Scotland. I planned a whole day around him: booked a really cute AirBnb weeks in advance, researched hikes we could go do, found a little cafe for lunch that could cater to his dietary requirements (difficult to find in rural Scotland), wrote him a thoughtful card, and gave him a small gift. I spent a fair bit of money as you could imagine, but I just wanted him to feel loved and cherished. I know it was “extra,” and I didn't need to spend so much, but I genuinely enjoyed doing it.

Fast forward to my birthday. A week or two beforehand, my boyfriend asked what I wanted to do. I said I didn’t have anything planned other than dinner with my family (which he was of course, invited to), and he said, “Okay, leave it with me.” I took that to mean he would plan something. I reiterated the day before that I’d really appreciate him planning some part of the day and taking the lead, as I was feeling pretty burnt out from planning recent travel and other events I had been in charge of organising, so it would be nice to have a day off. I would have been open to doing anything really,

When my birthday came, it became clear nothing had actually been planned. He didn't write me a card (in the past he has hand-made some really beautiful cards and wrote some very thoughtful messages), he had ordered a present but it hadn't arrived yet. He did make me pancakes though, so that was nice and I appreciated that. I figured the lack of card and late present are really quite minor things, so I tried to brush it off and enjoy the day anyway, but knowing he had not planned anything when he said he would did make me feel let down.

Since there was no plan for the day, I suggested we drive to the beach to do a coastal walk (about a 35 min drive), he agreed but seemed a little reluctant. During the drive and the walk he seemed very tired, quiet, and disengaged. I kept checking in to see if he was okay because it felt like he didn’t want to be there. I know everyone gets tired sometimes and that's fine, but on a birthday I guess I expected a bit more effort to push past it and try bring some positive energy (that's what I would do).

Later, when we got home, he was watching YouTube on his laptop. Since we were going out for dinner with my family, I tried to touch base with him about what time we should leave by. He didn’t pause the video at all, he didn't look at me, just gave me a nod when I said I wanted to go by a certain time. That made me feel dismissed. Even though I thought we’d agreed on a time to leave, but he fell asleep and wasn’t ready. I asked him how long he would need to get ready so I could wait for him, and then he got upset with me saying I was interrogating him.

The dinner with my family and was actually really nice. I felt cheered up being in my family's company as they made the effort to celebrate me, and my boyfriend seemed to be acting like his usual self – more talkative, engaging, having a good time. But when the two of us we got home and got ready to go to sleep, I got into bed and he took himself out to the couch and slept on the couch all night instead of coming to bed. I went to bed alone feeling quite sad and isolated, wondering if I’d done something wrong.

To be clear, there was no single thing that he ""did wrong"". It was more the overall pattern of inattention and apathy throughout the day that made me feel like my birthday wasn’t really important to him.

He is usually incredibly kind and thoughtful, which is why this hurts so much and why I’m questioning myself. He's at work today and I intend to speak to him about this later. But want to know if I'm being too sensitive.

So… am I being ridiculous for even caring about this at my age? Am I overreacting for feeling hurt and disappointed by my boyfriend's lack of enthusiasm on my birthday? And would it be a bad idea if I wrote him a letter about how I feel? I struggle with conflict at the best of times, and feel I can express myself the best when I have time to write things down, but I don't want a letter to seem passive aggressive.

Any advice and outside perspective would be appreciated.",2,1768943143.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

In fact there can be a significant impact. The oil cafestol in coffee can raise LDL by up to 15 points. 

From this paper:  “The diterpene cafestol represents the most potent cholesterol-elevating compound known in the human diet, being responsible for more than 80% of the effect of coffee on serum lipids, with a mechanism still not fully clarified.” (“On the Cholesterol Raising Effect of Coffee Diterpenes Cafestol and 16-O-Methylcafestol: Interaction with Farnesoid X Receptor”)

Gemini further explained: “The Mechanism: It acts as an agonist for the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) in the liver. This ""tricks"" the liver into downregulating the production of bile acids from cholesterol. Because the cholesterol isn't being broken down into bile, it stays in the bloodstream, raising LDL levels.”

1qidgvi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qidgvi,Out with the old...,"... and in with the new, Niche Zero that arrived just now.

Picture 3 is the old, in all its glory - a Kitchenaid Pro Line Burr Grinder in ""Pearl Metallic"", purchased from Amazon in 2009.  Cost me $149.99 at the time.

I honestly sorta love the thing.  It weighs 9.9 lbs (4.5 Kg) and is built like KitchenAid stand mixers used to be built 20 years ago. It doesn't really grind espresso out of the box, but you can recalibrate it in the usual way, by taking off the big front dial and putting it on different places until the finest setting is one click off burr chirp.

The KitchenAid is NOT a unimodal grinder by any means. It makes tons of fines, but that's part of the charm. I love the hearty mouth feel and chocolatey flavor of traditional espresso, and I almost always drink milk drinks (double-double iced latte with 2% milk in a 20 oz insulated tumbler is my usual morning ritual, year round).

It does have other downsides though. It struggles to grind fine enough, and I need to up my dose to make up for that. That big grind adjustment assembly wants to slip back coarser to where I just hang onto it the whole time, portafilter in the other hand (weighing my dose? Ha! I'm busy grinding as much coffee as will fit in the basket.) Oh, and retention. Probably measured in grams, not tenths of a gram.

So I knew what I had to do.

The espresso machine is a Breville BES840XL Infuser, purchased around 2015. Only ever replaced the group head gasket a couple of times, still going strong.

1qidfzl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qidfzl,"2026-2027 guide for couples planning Asheville area weddings (venues, budgets, NC weather, trends, & things to do for your wedding weekend)","We're Chestnut Ridge, a modern mountain wedding venue in Canton, about 15 miles west of Asheville. (These photos are from a recent wedding we hosted, beautifully captured by Sam Photo Co.) 🤍

We've hosted hundreds of weddings over the years, and we recently pulled together a comprehensive guide for couples planning Asheville area celebrations.

✨ A little about us:

We're a 150-acre estate with a covered chapel (you get the outdoor feel without weather stress), a vaulted reception hall, and a patio with bistro lights for cocktail hour. Everything is walkable, climate-controlled where it needs to be, and designed so the day flows naturally from ceremony to celebration.

✨ We offer three main packages:

* Venue + Event Management – for couples who've planned the details but want expert day-of execution
* Venue + Full Planning – complete design and vendor coordination from start to finish (most popular, especially for destination couples)
* Signature All-Inclusive – a curated, turnkey experience

Every package includes full-day access, our 3,500-piece décor boutique (tables, chairs, candles, vessels, all complimentary), BYOB bar service with professional bartenders, and in-house coordination or planning support.

✨ Why we created this guide:

After working with so many couples navigating the Asheville wedding scene, we noticed the same questions coming up: What should we actually look for in a venue? How's the weather in fall vs. spring? What's a realistic budget? Etc.

1qidfwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1qidfwk/anyone_else_quit_caffeine_what_effect_do_it_have/,Anyone else quit caffeine? What effect do it have on your migraines?,"I started getting severe migraines with aura in November of 2023. At first it was just occasional, but for most of 2025 it’s been every 2-3 days. I was on preventative Nurtec every other day, had imaging done on my neck and back, and went to 6 months of PT for the hypermobility in my neck. I quit alcohol, sugar, every food that can be a migraine trigger excluding coffee, cut out artificial fragrances, stopped staying up late or skipping meals….I mean I tried everything my doctor suggested. Nothing really helped. 

I have a family friend who is a holistic doctor and he told me I should quit caffeine. I refused for the longest time, but I started tapering down in the fall and finally fully quit in the new year. And the migraines…stopped. They were less frequent in the fall and have completely stopped in the winter. I am so happy to be rid of the migraines, but I love coffee so I’m upset that it seemed to work. I’m sitting here eating cheese without fear though, so….worth it I guess?

I was only drinking 200-300 mg of caffeine per day, and have done so for 17 years. I guess I may have just developed a caffeine sensitivity later in life? 

Wondering if anyone here has quit caffeine and if so, what effect it had on your migraines ",9,1768942984.0,migraine,15,0.85,False

A while back, I shared our ""Devolio"" template here. Long story short: we tried to get it on the Framer Marketplace, got rejected for some layout/contrast issues, and decided to pivot hard.

Instead of just tweaking it, we overhauled the whole vibe. We moved away from the basic terminal look to a distinct **Retro Cyber Brutalism** aesthetic. We wanted something that felt raw, industrial, and ""OS-like"" but still usable for devs.

**What’s under the hood:**

* **The Vibe:** High-contrast, industrial, strictly developer-focused.
* **Console Drop Nav:** Built a custom mobile overlay with a heavy spring open / instant zip close. It feels mechanical.
* **Smoother Motion:** Cleaned up the animation curves and added ""Ghost"" layers so the closing transitions don't snap awkwardly.

*First off hiii Morgan love your content and you of course! Congrats on getting married :)*



I (34f) matched with a guy (30m) we shall call him Steve (fake name).

Ok so this is a first for me but I was on bumble yknow swipping away and came across a cute guy. We have been talking since Nov 2025 just via texting to get to know each other. Also I was bedridden all December and Christmas was coming up so not a fun time for me.

Anyway I started chatting with this guy Steve as we had a lot in common from interests and nerdy stuff.  We also have been very VERY open about communication and mental health. 

However...only recently Jan 20th mid conversation via text we were discussing a show he was watching which had a shadowy creature in it. He goes 'Haha! Weird its a copy of what I can see sometimes.' 

Then he just continued the convo about the show. I brushed over it thinking '*ok he may not want to open that up just yet'* but it has rattled me a little. 

Steve has told me he has BPD and Anxiety. He is on medication and has a therapist. So he is safe from himself, not in any immediate danger or anything like that. So he does have help and aids for them.

I should also point out **we have not met up yet** but I was planning on meeting for a coffee sometime next weekend. But due to this '*seeing shadows*' thing I am honestly a little freaked out. I get it finding a potential partner is not all sunshine and rainbows. We all have baggage but I have not met this guy and he was just so chill about dropping that nugget of information mid sentence in a convo that did not address mental health.

I’ve been solo‑developing **Cantera Manage**r, a football academy management sim for Android, and it just hit **700 downloads in 20 days**. It’s not a huge number, but it feels amazing to see people playing something I built entirely on my own.

I wanted to share a bit about what I’ve learned so far, and get your thoughts on a pivot I’m considering.

When I launched, I went with the usual free‑to‑play + ads setup to cover costs. In theory it made sense, but in practice... it really doesn’t fit. The game is designed as a **quick, low‑pressure management sim,** something you can play during a coffee break, on a flight, or while waiting for the train. It’s supposed to feel like a small daily ritual, not a heavy, time‑consuming career mode. Even small ad interruptions break that flow completely.

Now I’m leaning toward removing ads entirely and exploring optional IAPs instead. The goal is to keep the project sustainable without compromising the player experience, but I’m still figuring out what kind of model would actually make sense for this kind of niche sim.

That’s where I’d love your input:

* How would you approach monetization for a small‑scale management sim like this?
* Have any of you experimented with “In APP Purchase” models?
* What’s worked for you when balancing sustainability and user experience?
* I’m also iterating on features: maybe deeper tactics, player/staff personalities, better season history tracking, still don't know the direction, but I want to be intentional about what to build next.

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1.72U

League: Minnesota Timberwolves vs Utah Jazz (8PM CST on NBA League Pass)

**Recap**: I cooled off the red hot Knights and might have fired up the Flyers. Two teams going opposite direction, Flyers were 0-6 (0-6 on the PL as well) on their last 6 games and VGK were 7-0 (5-2 on the PL) on their last 7 games and I might have reverse their trends because currently I am on a 4-POTD losing streak. I'm glad that I got Eichel to record a point and that was the only leg I needed on a hot key 7-legged lay. The other hot key lay was Eichel 1+ Point and VGK -1.5 (obviously didn't cover).

**Matchup:** If I lose this bet I will be doing fade myself POTDs. 

Today I'm going wit Anthony Edwards 40+ PR. This is a great matchup for AnTMaN. **Jazz has the worst defensive ratings and AnTMaN will be match up against one the worst NBA defensive rated player Keyonte George**. Don't get me wrong Keyonte is great player, he is an elite scorer, offensively he is great, but defenisvely he is one the weakest guards if not the weakest defensive guards in the league. AnTMaN should feast regardless because collectively the Jazz are the worst defense team. You look at his stats against this team and he's had a picnic. **AnTMaN has covered this line in his last 5 matchup vs the Jazz and 8 of his 9 matchup vs the Jazz.**

[He nearly covered in ALL his last 9 matchup vs the Jazz. Off by 1 reb\/pt on 3\/18\/24](https://preview.redd.it/6eqenex4fkeg1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c011bab02b7312f56ff4b32fee30ac25aeeaa27)

**He's recently return from foot injury and he went off the rails against the Spurs in his last game (55 Pts, 4 Rebs on 01/17/26)**. **There are blowout concerns just because how bad the Jazz are on defense**, but they are not a bad offensive team. They got players that can certainly dish out dimes and put up points, so I'll take my chances wit this player prop today.

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on AnTMaN 40+ PR. I'm also taking him for my King of the Court prop as well. I would take his threes too. Jazz gives up the most threes and AnTMaN shoots a lot of threes, I can see him hitting that line too. 

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

1qid4ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1qid4ex/want_to_be_the_most_interesting_person_in_the/,Want to Be the MOST Interesting Person in the Room? The Psychology That Actually Works,"Here's what nobody tells you: being interesting has nothing to do with how many countries you've visited or how impressive your job title sounds. I've spent years studying charisma, social dynamics, and human psychology through books, podcasts, and research, and here's the uncomfortable truth: most people are boring as hell because they're trying way too hard to be interesting.

The paradox? People who obsess over being interesting are often the least interesting. Meanwhile, the ones who genuinely fascinate others aren't even thinking about it. They've cracked a code that most people miss entirely.

Let me break down what actually works, backed by research and real insights from experts who've studied this subject for decades.

Step 1: Stop Performing, Start Being Curious

The biggest mistake? Treating conversations like a performance where you're the main act. Newsflash: nobody gives a shit about your monologue. Robert Greene talks about this in ""The Laws of Human Nature"" (bestselling book, over 4 million copies sold, this guy knows his shit). He explains that the most magnetic people are obsessively curious about others.

Here's the move: ask questions that actually dig deeper. Not the boring ""what do you do?"" crap. Try ""what's been taking up most of your headspace lately?"" or ""what's something you've changed your mind about recently?"" These questions make people think, and when someone feels intellectually stimulated around you, they remember you.

The psychology behind this is wild. When you make someone talk about themselves in meaningful ways, their brain releases dopamine. You literally become associated with feeling good. That's not manipulation, that's just understanding how humans work.

Step 2: Collect Weird Knowledge (On Purpose)

Interesting people have knowledge. They don't just know their field, they know random shit from everywhere. Read about mythology, then jump to neuroscience, then learn about 1920s architecture. This isn't about showing off, it's about building a mental library of ideas that connect in unexpected ways.

Check out ""Range"" by David Epstein (an award-winning science journalist). This book challenges everything you think about specialisation. Epstein shows that generalists who pull from multiple fields are actually more creative and interesting than narrow specialists. The best ideas come from cross-pollinating knowledge from different domains.

Practical tip: Use an app like Readwise to capture highlights from books, articles, and podcasts. Then actually review them. Your brain needs to see these ideas multiple times to make connections. I've been using it for a year, and the random knowledge combinations that pop up in conversations are insane.

For anyone serious about building that knowledge range efficiently, there's also BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia University grads and former Google engineers. It pulls from thousands of books, research papers, and expert interviews on psychology, communication, and social dynamics, then generates personalised audio learning plans based on exactly what you want to improve, like ""become more charismatic in conversations"" or ""develop more interesting opinions."" You control the depth, from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. The app has a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with mid-podcast to ask questions or get book recommendations. Plus, you can customise the voice. I use the sarcastic style because it keeps complex psychology digestible. Makes absorbing all this knowledge way more practical when you're commuting or at the gym.

Step 3: Have Actual Opinions (And Defend Them)

Nothing is more forgettable than someone who agrees with everything. Interesting people have spicy takes. Not to be contrarian assholes, but because they've actually thought deeply about things.

Listen to ""The Jordan Harbinger Show"" podcast; this guy interviews everyone from FBI negotiators to cult survivors to business legends. What makes it incredible? He doesn't just nod along. He pushes back, questions assumptions, and explores the uncomfortable angles. That's what makes conversations electric.

You need opinions on stuff that matters to you. Maybe you think morning routines are overrated bullshit. Maybe you believe cryptocurrency is a pyramid scheme. Whatever. Just have reasoned positions you can explain. People respect conviction, even when they disagree.

But here's the key: be willing to change your mind when presented with better information. That's not weakness, that's intelligence. And it's wildly attractive in conversations.

Step 4: Master the Art of Storytelling

Data shows people remember stories 22 times more than facts alone. If you can tell a good story, you're already in the top 10% of interesting people.

Read ""Storyworthy"" by Matthew Dicks (bestselling author, literally teaches storytelling workshops to thousands). This book will completely change how you talk about your experiences. The secret? Every story needs a transformation moment. Not just ""I went to Thailand,"" but ""I went to Thailand thinking I needed adventure, and came back realising I was running from something.""

Practice this: take boring everyday moments and find the internal shift. Got stuck in traffic? Cool. What realisation did you have while sitting there? That's your story. The external event is just the vehicle for the internal change.

Step 5: Develop Taste (In Literally Anything)

Interesting people have refined taste in something. Could be coffee, could be music, could be obscure films, doesn't matter. What matters is that you care deeply enough about something to develop informed opinions.

Try the app ""Likewise"" for discovering high-quality movies, books, and shows recommended by people with actual taste, not just algorithm garbage. When you have genuine enthusiasm for something and can explain why it's good beyond surface level, people lean in.

This isn't snobbery. It's about having standards and being able to articulate what makes something exceptional versus mediocre. That level of discernment is magnetic.

Step 6: Be Comfortable with Silence

This sounds backwards, but interesting people don't fill every silence with noise. They let conversations breathe. They're comfortable with pauses because they're not anxious about being perceived as boring.

Research from communication studies shows that strategic silence makes you appear more thoughtful and confident. It also gives the other person space to think deeper and share more vulnerable stuff.

Next conversation: try waiting an extra 2 seconds before responding. Watch how the quality of dialogue shifts. People start sharing the real thoughts, not just the rehearsed surface stuff.

Step 7: Live a Life Worth Talking About

Here's the hard truth: you can't fake being interesting if your life is boring. You need to actually do things. Take risks. Try weird hobbies. Fail at stuff publicly. Have adventures, even small ones.

This doesn't mean spending tons of money on travelling. It means being intentional about novelty. Take a different route to work. Try a restaurant that scares you a little. Go to that event alone where you know nobody.

Your brain needs new experiences to generate interesting thoughts. If you do the same shit every day, you'll have the same thoughts and same conversations as everyone else.

Check out ""The Courage to Be Disliked"" by Ichiro Kishimi (Japanese bestseller, based on Adlerian psychology, absolutely mind-bending). It argues that interesting people aren't trying to please everyone. They're living according to their own values, which naturally makes them stand out.

The bottom line? Being interesting isn't a personality trait you're born with. It's a skill set you build through curiosity, conviction, knowledge range, and actually living. Stop trying to impress people and start being genuinely fascinated by the world. That's the difference between someone people tolerate and someone people actively seek out.",1,1768942292.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False
1qid4en,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1qid4en/how_to_tell_if_an_introvert_actually_likes_you_13/,How to Tell if an Introvert Actually LIKES You: 13 Science-Backed Signs You're Probably Missing,"So I've been researching human connection patterns for a while now (books, psychology podcasts, behavioral studies, the whole deal), and one thing keeps coming up: introverts show affection completely differently than extroverts, but most dating advice ignores this entirely.

Here's the thing though. Society trains us to look for loud, obvious signals. Grand gestures. Constant texting. Public displays of affection. But introverts? They're operating on a different frequency. And if you're not tuned in, you'll miss some genuinely beautiful signals that someone's into you.

I started noticing this after reading ""Quiet"" by Susan Cain (NYT bestseller, literally changed how psychology views introversion). The book breaks down how introverts process emotions and relationships differently, not worse, just different. Made me rethink every ""mixed signal"" I'd ever received. Genuinely one of the most eye opening reads on human behavior.

Here's what actually matters when an introvert likes you:

**1. They initiate one on one time, specifically**

Introverts have limited social energy. If they're asking YOU to hang out, alone, that's massive. They're not randomly inviting their entire contact list to things. They're carefully choosing who gets their time.

Research from Dr. Laurie Helgoe (author of ""Introvert Power"") shows introverts form fewer but deeper connections. So when they reach out first? You're in that inner circle.

**2. They remember weirdly specific things you mentioned once**

You casually mentioned your favorite childhood snack three weeks ago? They remembered. That random story about your high school teacher? They bring it up later.

Introverts are observers. They're not dominating conversations, they're absorbing information. If they're storing details about YOUR life, they're interested. This isn't casual listening, it's active investment.

**3. They text you during their recharge time**

Introverts need alone time to function. It's not optional, it's biological. So if they're texting you when they're supposed to be recharging? That means something.

There's also this AI learning app called BeFreed that's been useful for understanding relationship dynamics deeper. It pulls from psychology research, relationship experts, and books like the ones mentioned here to create personalized audio content. You can literally ask it to explain introvert communication patterns or build a learning plan around ""understanding introverted partners better,"" and it generates podcasts tailored to your specific situation. The content depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to detailed 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Pretty solid for anyone trying to decode these subtle behavioral patterns.

**4. Their body language changes around you**

They might not be verbally expressive, but watch their non verbal cues. Do they face you completely during conversations? Maintain longer eye contact than usual? Lean in when you talk?

Dr. Elaine Aron's research on highly sensitive people (many introverts fall into this category) shows they're hyperaware of subtle environmental changes. They're reading YOUR body language constantly, and adjusting theirs in response.

**5. They share their inner world with you**

Introverts live largely in their heads. Their thoughts, ideas, creative projects, these are sacred spaces. If they're letting you in, showing you their writing, their art, their weird theories about random stuff, you're seeing something most people never get access to.

**6. They make exceptions to their routines for you**

Introverts are creatures of habit. Routines help them manage energy. So when they skip their usual Friday night alone to see you? When they go to that loud party because you asked? They're making a deliberate choice.

**7. They actually respond to your messages (consistently)**

Introverts are selective about communication. They're not replying to everyone. But if they're consistently responding to you, even when they're in hermit mode? That's intentional.

**8. They get quieter in group settings when you're around**

Counterintuitive right? But sometimes introverts get MORE reserved around people they like in groups. They're observing you, trying to figure you out, maybe feeling slightly nervous.

The book ""The Introvert Advantage"" by Marti Olsen Laney (psychotherapist, specializes in introversion) explains this perfectly. Introverts process emotions internally first. So that quietness? It's actually them processing their feelings about you.

**9. They share their comfort activities with you**

Reading. Gaming. Hiking alone. Whatever helps them recharge. If they're inviting you into these sacred rituals, they're essentially saying ""I don't need to recharge FROM you.""

This is huge. Most people drain introverts. You're apparently not draining.

**10. They open up slowly, then suddenly**

Introverts don't do surface level well. They'll seem reserved for weeks, then suddenly they're telling you about their childhood trauma or their biggest dreams. This isn't random, it's trust building.

**11. They make direct eye contact during deep conversations**

Not constantly, but during meaningful moments? Their eye contact is intense and sustained. They're fully present with you.

Research shows introverts prefer depth over breadth in conversations. If they're giving you that intense presence, they're invested.

**12. They defend your absence**

You're not there but they mention you positively. They stick up for you in conversations. This matters because introverts don't waste words on people they don't care about.

**13. They seem more energized after spending time with you**

Most social interaction depletes introverts. But the right person? Actually energizes them. If they're not immediately retreating to their cave after hanging out, if they seem lighter and more animated, that's the tell.

The bottom line is this: introverts show love through attention, not volume. They're not going to shout their feelings from rooftops. They're going to remember your coffee order. Make time when they have none. Choose you over solitude, which is basically their love language.

Stop looking for fireworks. Start noticing the quiet, consistent choices someone makes toward you. That's where the real feelings live.",2,1768942291.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False

I was talking to someone about this because I am never sure whether other people take 'coffee' literally, or whether they just understand it to mean hanging out, chatting, and having any kind of drink. I think for neurotypical people it's just code for sit down and talk, the actual coffee isnt important?

My parents' socket circuit was tripping frequently over the weekend, with everything unplugged the circuit held, but as things went back in, it began tripping again. 

There was one of those single gang to 4 gang sockets that turned out to have a loose connection, but even after this was rectified, the fault was persistent 

They have homecare, which covers electrics, so they called a British gas sparky out, and the end result was the suggestion of a board change. 

I will say, it's an old bungalow with old wiring, with the exception of the conservatory. the board is plastic and mostly on MCBs, so i know a board change is not a terrible idea. 

the property was previously my grandparents and since my parents have moved in, more tech and appliances has been added ie coffee machine, sonos system, a blind motor and media wall lighting, all from the ring.

the ring circuit in question does cover most of the house and even has a garage submain spured off it. the garage has a light, a freezer, and a garage door motor on it. 

given how loaded the ring is, how likely is it that a board change is going rectify this without atleast a partial rewire to reduce the load on the circuit and the addition of more circuits 

do British gas tend to push for more outside the homecare plan?

is it worth getting a second opinion?

I have CG 2365 and worked domestic/commercial for about 2 and half year, mostly install work, but now work in high voltage so i know a little bit, but my knowledge is still fairly limited - im intrigued more than anything and interested to hear poeples thoughts.

I (30 F, White-presenting Canadian) have been dating my boyfriend (29M, Chinese-Canadian) for about 3 months. We've been friends for over a year, and in August of 2025 we started going on dates and getting to know each other in a more intentional way. He's amazing, he's so patient and kind, he's absolutely brilliant, so sweet, and such a cutie (if you ask me). Like many other Chinese and Asian families, he still lives at home. I've grown up around a lot of Asian families, and worked at a Korean church for a season (I not that's not the same as Chinese culture, but I figure there are some meta-takeaways), so I can recognize that there are some cultural differences in how we were raised, difference in family values, etc.

We decided to meet the families early, in part because we got together before the holiday season and being in our careers and ""older"", we're both ready to settle down, and again we'd been friends for a year prior, so we're pretty serious about what our intentions are for this relationship. That said, he hasn't really brought any girl home before, and his parents haven't liked any of the girls he'd brought home before because they lied to them about things and such. My thought, was if I show that I'm honest and have integrity, and we do things differently than how he's navigated them in the past, maybe this would help to establish trust and get off on a good foot. This did not turn out the way I hoped it would.

Instead, this seemed to rub them the wrong way. They wouldn't ask anything about me/ us, and eventually my boyfriend asked why they never ask about me/ us, and they said they didn't realize it was serious. I can live with that. It seemed like things were going to get a bit better, but the one time I did get invited to a family function, I was so nervous, embarrassed myself and then just kind of stayed quiet. Worried that they might interpret my quietness as me snubbing them (my boyfriend made us leave without me having a chance to greet the mom or sister) after finally allowing me to come, I sent a message to the sister (25F), at my boyfriend's suggestion, to just say I'd enjoyed the food she made, sorry that I was awkward, I was just nervous, (she also has social anxiety, so my boyfriend that this would be something we'd connect and relate on) but I'm really looking forward to getting to know her, and I had made a little card for the mom to say I enjoyed the food she made, and wished I had a chance to tell her that at the party, apologize for the embarrassing moment (I misunderstood something and made things awkward), and just that I was looking forward to getting to know her as well. My boyfriend read over these things, and said they were good and such. Their reactions, however, were that I seem high maintenance, desperate, insecure and have low-self esteem. They also commented on how I look, and not in a positive, complimentary way.

I do want them to like me, I care about my boyfriend, and therefore the people he cares about. If we're really planning on building a future together, I think it makes sense that I would want a good relationship with his family. It'd been over 4+ years since my last relationship / 'meet the parents' (and I've never experienced parents/ families not liking me, which may add to this), and we had just come from another party with his church community that I was meeting and getting to know before heading to this other party, so I think I was just overwhelmed and having embarrassed myself, I was just feeling extra awkward, however despite that being the only time they've met me, they seem to have a lot of opinions that I think are unfair. Maybe there's some validity to a degree, I can get behind that. Maybe it was overkill to send those messages, I was just raised and have a job where there are very specific ways you navigate social graces, so I thought I was being polite. I think that can be chalked up to things being 'lost in translation'.

Anyway, that all said, don't like having people over (fair, it's their house, their prerogative), they don't really want to make plans to do things with my boyfriend and I, like grab coffee or a meal (fine, maybe they'd rather wait until we've been dating longer), but then they continue to comment that I'm a stranger, and they don't know me, but they aren't making an effort to, so it's kind of a circular issue. It's completely dependent on them. I'm beginning to make my peace that either this will take longer than anticipated, or they may never want to know/ accept/ like me. I don't think it's something to break up over at this point - my boyfriend is great, it's not his fault. You can't force people to like you, I just don't know what to do. My family has been so warm and welcoming, and trying to help integrate him, whereas my experience with his family has been so discouraging and difficult.

**Insight would be especially be helpful if there are perspectives on:**

* inter-racial/cultural relationships (in particular if there is a Chinese background, so I can better understand the thought process/ culture more)
* how to navigate when your partner's family doesn't like you
* any encouragement
* if you're a person who takes longer to warm up to people, what do you wish people understood about how you navigate relationships with others?
* how do I continue to foster a healthy relationship with my boyfriend, regardless of whether his family is on board or not?
* what, if any, next steps are in my capacity, as to how do I navigate things with the family? Right now, I'm just pulling back, and choosing not to put any effort in, hoping it will cool things off; In the beginning, I wanted to be intentional, but I can kind of understand how they might see intentionality as something forced, my thought had just been that it would show that I cared

Thanks for taking the time to read this all; this isn't even all of it, but it's kind of the crux of the issue. The rest of it just has to do with things I made for my boyfriend that he decided to share with them, and them not liking my cooking or thinking I'm doing to much by sending them food, but I wasn't, it was just for my boyfriend and he decided to share it. The only thing I gave them was a roasted pepper soup, because the dad had given me peppers he had grown, so I thought it would be a nice gesture (I gave my boyfriend a soup, and he took a second one for his family). Anyway, yeah. I think it comes down to different culture's social graces and what is considered 'polite' being misunderstood, but maybe I'm wrong here.

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend's family has a lot of opinions about me from one meeting, says it's because they don't know me, but aren't putting forth any effort to get to know me",7,1768941843.0,AMWFs,1,1.0,False

I often fold my laundry whilst watching Monk or Columbo and getting upset at how bad the killer's mistakes are or commend Columbo on a job well done before(Not Monk though... he's continuously aware of how good he is).

Looking for someone who values kindness over drama, who’s content with cozy nights in but down for a spontaneous walk or a low-key adventure. If you like thoughtful gestures, honest conversation, and someone who’ll actually remember the little things, we might click.

If you laugh at silly memes, enjoy a game now and then, and don’t mind that my idea of “wild” is ordering takeout and debating the numerous times Columbo and Monk commit fellonies then we might have ourselves a good ol' time.

Anyhoo, have a good week in the meantime.

It all started in my cramped garage, a place that smelled faintly of oil and desperation, with a single, sputtering heat press. My grand vision? Custom t-shirts. I was convinced people would pay good money for my slightly-off-center designs and questionable choice of font pairings. Spoiler alert: they didn't, at least not at first.

Those early days were brutal, honestly. I was burning the midnight oil, fueled by instant coffee and the nagging fear that I was making a colossal mistake. Every 'ding' of a new order notification was a jolt of pure adrenaline, but there were far more silent hours, staring at an empty inbox, wondering if I should just throw in the towel. I remember one particularly low point, surrounded by boxes of blank tees, feeling the weight of every penny I'd sunk into this venture. It was a proper gut punch.

But something inside me just wouldn't quit. I devoured every free marketing course, every YouTube tutorial on design, and even learned some basic coding to tweak my terrible website. Slowly, painstakingly, things started to shift. A few positive reviews, a local market stall that surprisingly went well, and suddenly, the 'dings' became more frequent. Each small win felt like a monumental victory, a little flicker of hope in the darkness.

Fast forward a few years, and that greasy garage has been replaced by a small, but proper, office. I've even got a couple of awesome people helping me out – no more solo heat-pressing marathons! It's still a hustle, don't get me wrong, and new challenges pop up daily, but the feeling of seeing something you poured your heart into actually thrive? Pure magic.

It's a far cry from those ramen noodle days, and I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. The resilience it built, the lessons learned – priceless.

I have to admit I’m shocked over the unabashed lying on the apps. Things have really changed since before covid it seems.

I (M42) went on a coffee date this afternoon, and it seems that the woman (34) I met had gained at least 40 pounds since she took the pictures she posted on her profile. She also lied about her age, as she looked much older than she posted. She also lied to me about being physically active and enjoying the outdoors and travel. Neither of which she has done in years. She seemed like a really nice person, and was very pleasant, but throughout the conversation I couldn’t get over the fact she wasn’t honest about any of this prior to meeting.

This isn’t the first time I’ve had this happen since joining Hinge. I’ve been on 4 first dates since I signed up, and each person has misrepresented themselves (usually lying about their age by 10 to 15 years compared to their photos).

It’s the people that tell you to make sacrifices and get rid of things that cost you money that way you can save.

It's like sure I could get rid of Hulu live, Spotify and morning coffee. But what will that save me? An extra $200 a MONTH. 30 days going without the small things that bring me happiness and at least make working feel worth it, all for $200?

Then they might argue “That’s extra $200 you didn’t have. And when it adds up that’s $2400 a year”

I’m sorry but yes I would take 200 more a month but in the grand scheme of things it’s not life changing. So to take away some things that bring me joy for a whole month just for a small amount of money doesn’t sound like a fair trade. I just feel it’s really tone deaf when people make those remarks.

It’s like I can’t really buy a house just by giving up these things. In fact I could give all this stuff up for decades and STILL not be able to afford a house.

It’s just tiring being told we’re lazy or not willing to make sacrifices when the reality is things are so much tougher now. Also, those people back then worked ONE job and made it. We have to work TWO or more just to STILL struggle. So how are we lazy or not willing to work?

The answer isn’t saving the very little money we already make. It’s PAYING us more. Especially considering how everything is rising in cost meanwhile wages stay the same.

Edit: For context I’m 29 years old.

If you’re blowing most of your paycheck on bullshit and ignoring responsibilities, that’s irresponsible. But if you’re paying your bills (even barely) and you want a few things that make your free time tolerable or give you some motivation each day, cutting them out for such a small amount of money makes no sense and isn’t as helpful as these people tend to think it will be.

If anyone is wondering here is the recipe I made. I have to admit the goal was to make it more paste-like, that didn't happen because it was my first try.

It is kinda watery and spreads a lot so they are foraging for it as well. So here is the recipe I made: 

# ingredients:

2 teaspoons agar

1 normal sized crushed algae wafers (hikari)

10-20 small sinking wafers containing spirulina,   krill & silkworm(hikari)

2x2 cm piece of nori sheet (random supermarket brand)

4 teaspoons artemia gel juice (dupla)

# preparation: 

put 200ML water to a boil ( I used a kettle)

ground all the dry ingredients ( I used a cheap coffee grinder)

once the water boils pour it in to a cup

add all ingredients 

for the next hour or so stir it every 5 minutes to avoid it all clumping on the bottom.

pour it somewhere flat to cool down further for storage ( I used a freezer bag) 

# feeding + response

Once cooled down I poured 3 teaspoons near the lily pipe exhaust. the otos on the other side of the exhaust started actively foraging rather quickly. 

One teaspoon I dropped down behind the lily pipe exhaust ( location of the video that is filmed) where a group of them usually gathers.

After lights out I checked once quickly with the flash of my phone from the top, they were still actively grazing the area.

Immediately when we first took her home, she was trouble. She was an escape artist and we couldnt leave her home alone because she would get out of her kennel and into everything from coffee beans to markers. When she couldn't get out of her kennel, she chewed at it to the point of bleeding, and we would come home to blood spatter all around the kennel. Her trainer gave up, saying that some dogs just can't be kennel trained. Fine. So we dedicated an entire room to her, with toys, a window to the street, and food and water bowls for while we are gone. We never leave her home alone for more than 5 hours (though many of her shenanigans start immediately after we leave), and if we run close to that time, we have a neighbor or friend let her out to use the restroom and play for a while.

She quickly learned how to open drawers and cabinets, so we added child locks. Next it was doors. She learned she could push up the lever style handle and open doors that way. So we switched all of the doorknobs to round ones. Then she learned how to grab and turn round handles. Now we've added an external lock to her room.

We talked to the vet about her issues, and have tried many different anxiety medications (trazodone, gabapentin, and one more that I cannot remember the name of). We got a second dog, thinking maybe if she wasn't alone while we were gone, that might help. The first time we left the puppy in her kennel in Nova's room while we left, Nova opened the door of the kennel the second she heard the garage door close. (We have a camera to crack in on her) We tried a sturdier kennel (ruffland). She ripped the door off of that one. Our other dog is a dachshund mix, and is a notorious house pooper, so we don't want her out. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, my dog is an evil mastermind who keeps outsmarting us at every turn. She gets two hours of walking daily (one hour in the morning and one at night), plus plenty of mental stimulation (training, puzzles, play, etc).

I still spend plenty of time in the lab for experiments and analysis, and I keep the same hours,  I just prefer using the office for reading/writing tasks.

1qichr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1qichr3/my_boyfriends_parents_treat_me_like_garbage/,My boyfriend’s parents treat me like garbage.,"My boyfriend (M21) and I (F23) have been together for nearly a year and a half. I’m going to give some context before I dive into it, but I’m just looking to vent and not feel so alone in this situation.

He comes from a very conservative, half jewish family. His mom is in her 50’s, and jewish. His dad is in his early 70’s, not jewish, but very conservative and from Alabama originally. They are very wealthy, I’d consider them socialites as they have a pretty well known social image in the city they live in. My boyfriend is a pilot still accumulating flight hours, and still lives with his parents, which is obviously not a problem in my opinion. His mom is the current (very successful) breadwinner, is a control freak, like in the overly protective boy mom sort of way. She has this idea of how her son’s life should go, and also lives her life in fear of lots of things going wrong. She’s a clean freak, but kind of a hypocrite at the same time. Like she can’t handle candles, flowers, or perfumes because she “can’t handle the fragrance”. Very much an almond mom too about food/health. All natural foods/products, nothing with chemicals that can cause cancer, etc. And into the whole “home remedy” meds vs actual medicine. His dad is just kind of there. He’s older, retired, not quite an alcoholic but drinks more than he needs to at his age too frequently. He also has insane hearing and memory loss, dozing off multiple times throughout the day. He has some very… interesting views on the world, even coming from myself as a moderate open minded independent, and is very judgmental towards anyone that isn’t a white male.

Now I also come from a moderately republican family, both my mom and dad are in their mid 60’s, catholic. I live on my own, with my best friend, hours from my parents. They have come a long way, they’re both open minded loving people, and love me more than anything, even with the context I’m about to give which may shock some. I happen to be a trans woman. I pass very well, I started my transition at 16, and I am kind of the definition of I transitioned simply to blend in and live my life as a female. 99% of people do not know unless they’re told as it is not a personality trait or something I wear on my shoulder. My boyfriend is very okay with this, as he falls somewhere in the realm of being bisexual, and knew from the start of us dating.

When I initially met his parents in March of 2025, I had asked that he tell them about me, for safety and comfort of everyone involved, and he did. We decided to introduce me as a friend first, as we were only 6 months into dating and I am the first person his parents have met knowing I am trans. They loved me. It felt amazing, his mom was open and suggested I stay the night when I visit, as I live an hour and a half from them, so my boyfriend and I could hangout for longer periods of time without either of us doing the drive so frequently, and his dad didn’t mind either. Between March and June of 2025 I’d spend 1-3 nights over at a time, every other week at most, I was taken out to dinners by them, we’d hangout one on one while my boyfriend was at flight school, his mom even offered to take me under her wing with real estate as I’m studying to get my license. I got very personal and told them my entire backstory about my personal journey and my transition in June, his mom also told me her deep life story. She came from a broken family, not so nice area, and how she got up and made this life for herself and her family. (After marrying very rich, chasing her now husband at a country club/golf course even though he didn’t want to date her initially.) Things were genuinely great. Either my boyfriend and I would sleep on the couch and the other in his room, but the more I’d stay over, the more we got close to cracking and telling them. We just wanted to do it correctly so it wasn’t this big betrayal or deceitful event. The last two times I stayed over in June, his parents came into his room to say goodnight, and I’d be in there still in the bed with him, and we’d kind of be cuddling or holding onto each other, and we didn’t try to hide anything. The last night I stayed over, I ended up falling asleep in his room, when his parents came in to say goodnight to us, I was knocked out in his arms asleep on him. I wokeup in his bed, he was already at his flight school, and I walked out to his parents on the couch (I was MORTIFIED) but they acted completely natural and normal, said goodmorning, made me coffee, nothing different. I left later that same day and this is where everythinggggg changed.

We thought we were in the clear because HOW do they not already know at this point. Under the stress of his flight school (ATP) and wanting to just be open and freely together in front of his family, he told them out of the blue without me there. It did not go well. To summarize, his perfect elitist mom was worried about how this would affect him, his image, what this meant for his future, his sexuality, people judging him, dating someone not jewish, this was so unexpected for her somehow, and I don’t live up to the image of their sons girlfriend. His dad is just a lowkey racist, close minded, piece of shit so he couldn’t wrap his head around his son dating a girl with a dick, and  he “could never call or consider (my name) his son’s girlfriend publicly.” I was immediately black balled from their lives.

Since this happened in late June, my boyfriend and I went through some hard moments but stuck it through in the end. He has fought and defended me relentlessly but to almost no avail. In September, I finally saw them again in person, I updated them on my current job training I’m headed to soon (flight attendant) and his mom was boasting about how she’s envious, she always wanted to be one at my age and regrets it everyday, etc. his dad was just kind of meh but they’re nice to my face. They know we are dating now, they know how long we have been, and even though it’s been awhile and their own son has cried to them and called them out on how gross and rude they’re being to someone they said they loved until they knew I was his girlfriend, they still exclude me from everything. My birthday, in September, nothing. Thanksgiving, nothing. Hanukah and Christmas, nothing. My boyfriend and I spent my birthday, Thanksgiving, and Christmas with my family as a result of this. They were surprisingly okay with him coming to my family for the week of the holidays, yet ignore me completely and made plans with my boyfriend for afterwards which I was not invited to.

This is very summarized, I never question myself as a result of my transition as I NEVER deal with rude or transphobic people myself so this is a first for me, and it hits really really hard for me. I’ve cried countless times to him over it. His mom always plans something when we are together and guilts him into attendance without me, holding the financial support and comfort they give him over his head. It’s genuinely gross to him, and so rude to me.

With it being cold, I figured I would put some work into it and see if it is worth keeping. Scrubbed the inside and top with a wire brush to get as much rust, then vacuumed it out. Started a fire in it and OMG the smoke that came off and out of it!  Once it had burned for about 2 hours I noticed the carbon build up where the smoke was pouring out and I remembered seasoning my cast pots and pans. Got the wire brush and a wet rag and went at it again. Once I felt it was as clean as I could get it I rubbed a layer of olive oil into it. Yea, not fun on a hot stove, but after a couple layers I have what you see in the last picture. It is burning hot, and not as much (hardly any) smoke as before.

Only thing that I've changed recently is I used 1 stick of TWW for 2.5 gallons, when before that I used 1 stick for 1 gallon and then had a gallon of distilled and id mix in kettle for every brew. I got tired of doing that so I just did 1 stick for the 2.5 gallons. Im not sure how that could have changed a lot, going from 1/2 concentration to 2/5, but I read water issues can cause this drying sensation


Anything else to check? I noticed it on multiple coffees, and on both grinders.

1qicaim,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1qicaim/self_sabotage_vs_listening_to_your_gut/,Self sabotage vs Listening to your gut,"I’m posting because I’m honestly exhausted and could really use outside perspective from people (esp women) who aren’t emotionally involved.

I’m engaged, wedding planned for about 10 months from now. I love my fiancé, he’s kind, emotionally attuned, gentle, and deeply supportive. He was there for me through some really rough patches over the last few years and handled them with so much patience and care. He understands my emotions well, shows up when things are hard, and has been a steady presence in my life. My family loves him, my friends like him, and on paper this is a really good relationship.

And yet… I can’t stop questioning whether I chose the RIGHT person.

Few years ago, I was dating two people casually at the same time (they both knew). I’ll call them D and L. L is my current fiancé. D was someone I had a very strong emotional connection with. He’s charismatic, extroverted, very high-energy, lots of friends, very much a “go-getter.” He came from a more comfortable background and had a lifestyle that felt exciting and expansive. He was also a citizen of the country I’m in, which mattered to me because I’m on a visa and immigration stress has been a constant in my life.

I ultimately chose L because I felt safer with him, was more physically attracted to him, and he felt like someone I could build a life with. Plus he was closer and with D, it would’ve been long distance, which I wasn’t down for. But D visited me often, really put in the effort to see me in person as much as possible, but I really did not want to do something long distance because I didn’t think it was sustainable 

L and I have been together almost four years now. We’ve lived together, planned a future, and gone through genuinely hard life stuff.

But I’ve always had this quiet “what if” in the back of my mind about D, mostly around lifestyle, energy, and a sense of joy and momentum in life.

Recently, D reached out with a casual New Year’s message. He now lives near me. We got coffee. Nothing inappropriate happened, but emotionally it completely threw me. Not because I’m secretly in love with him, but because it brought me back to a version of myself that felt more alive, ambitious, and excited about life when D and I had first met. I have no feelings for him but he just had so many qualities that my fiancé lacks. Like a more active life, he’s not passive, has really pursued his dreams in the past couple years, has an incredible friends circle, well established etc. 

At the same time, L has been struggling. He’s anxious about work, worried about layoffs, on a temporary assignment, dealing with visa uncertainty (like me, so I get it). He also really struggles with being active, exuberant, and socially engaged. I feel like I’m missing a certain joie de vivre in my life, and I know I’m responsible for that too. I’ve tried really hard to bring energy, plan things, build community, create momentum for both of us.

We’ve had many conversations about this. He has tried, genuinely, after multiple talks. But his baseline just isn’t the same as mine …and I can’t fault him for that either. It’s not a lack of effort so much as a difference in temperament and drive.

I was honest with him about the coffee and my doubts. It hurt him deeply. He cried for hours and talked about how lonely and stuck he feels, especially socially. That broke my heart. He’s not defensive or dismissive — he’s reflective and vulnerable. But will he really change these things that I really want in a partner? 

I keep circling the same thoughts. Am I settling for safety? Did I compromise too much of what makes me feel alive? Would life feel lighter or more joyful with someone like D Or am I romanticizing a past connection that was never tested by real life with me?

What scares me most is the idea of being alone and unmoored. Leaving L and then realizing D doesn’t even want me feels unbearable. At the same time, the idea of getting married and always wondering “what if” scares me too.

If L were a bad partner, this would be easy. But he’s not. He’s good. He loves me well. And that makes this decision feel impossible.

Have any of you encountered something like this as women? How do you tell the difference between fear and intuition? Have you ever left a good relationship because something felt missing and did you regret it? Or have you stayed, worked on it, and felt grateful you did?

Please be honest but kind. I’m really tired and trying to make sense of feelings that don’t line up neatly with logic.

1qica90,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qica90/a_fleeting_moment_of_degeneracy_part_5/,A Fleeting Moment of Degeneracy [Part 5],"Even now it makes me laugh, the comically unabashed transparency of their corruption. Around the time the Panama Papers came out, claims of senior managers seen wheelbarrowing cash out the backdoors of a private bank in Ta’ Xbiex surfaced. The kind of bank that only the truly wealthy used. They knew that the media were on their way to swarm the place and they had confidentiality to protect. 

It was a kind of open secret in Malta, or maybe it wasn’t a secret at all. But the people who ran the country, made and upheld the laws, were some of the biggest criminals among us all. Like Blackbeard and his crew burying their treasures out among the beaches of the Caribbean, they were all tax evaders and money-launderers. If there was no further proof that a change had to come, surely it was in black and white print for all to read. And yet nothing happened. They would call a snap election, and we would just keep electing them back in. 

At the head of the list of miscreants would surely be the Prime Minister and his family. But that was superfluous, they were all in on it. They were playing the Maltese edition of Monopoly and nobody else was invited to the table. But what were we supposed to do? Vote Nationalist? Forget it. 

By the end of summer, I decided I was done with my lawyer. I needed someone new. A person who I figured could make the problem go away. Someone in the know. Someone well loved and respected by those I hated the most. If anyone could fix this, they would. Someone known for changing the laws if it meant sorting out their client, that would end up being the case for me after all. It wasn’t so much of a gamble as it was a sale of the soul. 

It was also around this point I had taken up as much work as I could get. Gradually building consistent fourteen to sixteen hour days. Private lessons, consulting, showing apartments, writing marketing material, and spending the rest of my time enjoying the flow. Partying until the early hours of the morning and going into work a short time thereafter. Hungover, tired, and using only benzos and coffee to keep my nerves steady. It was a wild time.

Resolve seemed round the corner as it always does, that winter we decided to take a trip up to Rome. The whole thing came about over a bitter argument with the girl. God only knows what about. But of course her immediate response was to throw money at the problem and assume it would go away. As we drank red wine while looking out at the moon over the great dome of St. Paul from a friend’s apartment, the issue seemed quelled… for the time. 

Between the intense two days of sightseeing, sandwiched with aperitivi and dinners with old friends, we became exhausted rather than closer. We would bicker on the subway and always be in each other’s faces. Fussing obnoxiously in public places the way you could only get away with in Italy. Naturally, the days ended with intense love making, but the dichotomy of emotions from hour to hour led me to believe that things weren’t as they seemed. 

Ultimately though it was never about Rome, or our squabbling, or about seeing things eye to eye; it was inevitable. Her acid-powered weekly schedule of lawyers and property and estate, contrasted to my starch-collared, benzo driven days of erratically running back and forth across the islands in a way that simply wouldn’t do. Most of all, she was concerned that the small Asian women in my classes were getting a little too googley eyed for her tastes. That my virtue may remain true for not much longer.

 Waving to each other as we went in and out of the courthouse didn’t help either. That would be a major strain on even the most secure relationships.",2,1768940437.0,stories,1,1.0,False
