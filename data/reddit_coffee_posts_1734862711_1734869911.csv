I had a pattern of anger and a short temper toward my partner as I began to develop a fear of abandonment. I broke up with my ex during one of my low cycles. But deep down, I know she has been the greatest person I have ever known. I am beyond appreciative of her efforts, patience, and hard work, which I still speak about to this day.

It‚Äôs been almost 15 months, and not a single day has passed without her being on my mind. Initially, I had beautiful emotions about her. I was so grateful that I told myself, even if I never get married, those four years were the most beautiful of my life. She elevated my self-awareness with her support, love, and care. She was always there for me, even when I was hard to handle and stuck in my routines. She helped me with my work, encouraged me to work on my relationship with my mom, and pushed me to improve my career. She went grocery shopping with me, shared my interests even when they weren‚Äôt hers, took me to the hospital when I needed it, and took care of me. I have never felt peace anywhere else. She was my ride-or-die.

I often thought about how beautiful and platonic our connection was. Yet, I made many mistakes, and she was always understanding and forgiving. Her beauty, inside and out, led me to set strict rules in my mind to try and be a better partner. For a while, things went fine, but I have been regretting my actions since the day we broke up. Initially, I tried to tell myself, ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs meant to be, then let it be.‚Äù But as time passed, I started seeing how unstable my energy was in the relationship, compared to her constant, beautiful energy. She made me feel alive and full of life. That realization brought guilt. I felt I should have been better and began reflecting on my behavior. I told myself I needed to work on those issues because if I chose her, I couldn‚Äôt afford to hurt her. And I chose her.

When I thought deeply about it, I saw the patterns in my behavior but couldn‚Äôt pinpoint the main issue. I came to the realization that I needed to be honest with myself. So I tried to reconcile, but I approached it with uncertainty and fear of rejection, which came across as manipulative. I was in such a low place that I had no shame in trying to work on all the beautiful things I still held for her. She was a keeper. I crossed my boundaries and pushed for a second chance. When that didn‚Äôt work, I tried to just be her friend, hoping to prove myself and be there for her in a better way. I wanted to show even more gratitude for her, but she said no because of my actions and what she perceived as a lack of honesty.

I was shocked by how much my behavior aligned with BPD tendencies. What saddens me the most is that I never lied about major things, but I lied about my shame. I would hide phases where I consumed drugs or got blacked-out drunk because I feared judgment and felt ashamed. I never lied about women. I always spoke honestly about my encounters and never even thought about being with anyone else . I loved her too much. But I still broke her trust. I used Tinder during one of my low moments, matched with a random person, and told the girl I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything. After a few texts, the girl asked to meet for coffee. I went, but it lasted less than an hour. I felt ashamed and knew it was an unnecessary move. I came clean to my ex, but it jeopardized the trust between us. She didn‚Äôt take it well, and I was already hating myself and feeling unworthy, fearing she would leave. That fear caused me to push for the end with no contact.

Now, 15 months later, I‚Äôve started therapy and am working on building a complete picture of myself. Through therapy, I was asked if I had ever cheated. The truth is, I have very low sexual desires and never cheated or had the intention to cheat. My childhood trauma has made me fear becoming someone who cheats, and that‚Äôs why I still carry guilt for actions that felt like betrayal. I still want no one else, but I feel sad and frustrated because she was already helping me work through these issues. I wish I could tell her this truth now, but I can‚Äôt out of respect for her boundaries.

This process has taught me to work on myself and to be more honest, which is something I hadn‚Äôt fully practiced before. I‚Äôm building myself brick by brick, but I often feel the urge to speak my truth, and it hurts knowing I caused her pain. I truly care about her more than anyone else.

Any advice? I‚Äôm still trying to cope with these feelings and the thought of being selfish. I want to be there for her and work on a possible future, even do couples therapy, if that‚Äôs ever possible.

Long story short, I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (28M) for four years. He‚Äôs been prone to hiding things from me, and I‚Äôve caught him lying multiple times. For the past 2-3 years, I‚Äôve tried to break up with him, but he always comes back crying.

The biggest issue I have is his dishonesty. He says he hides things because of how I react, but I value truth above all else. Despite this, he continues lying because he‚Äôs afraid of losing me. Over the last few days, we‚Äôve been fighting more because I feel like enough is enough.

He talks about our future like it‚Äôs going to be amazing, but in reality, we can‚Äôt even live together, and he still hasn‚Äôt introduced me to his mother. He expects me to introduce him to my parents, have in mind we come from different religious backgrounds.

Now, here‚Äôs where things get tricky. I have a friend (21F) who has always been on his side during our relationship. She claims she loves us both and can‚Äôt pick sides, but it feels like she‚Äôs already chosen his. She calls him late at night to talk about her problems, meets him for coffee, and recently even went to his house and met his mother‚Äîsomething I still haven‚Äôt done after four years.

Yesterday, I woke up and saw an Instagram story of her wearing his hoodie. I sent him a screenshot, asking about it. He then told me that two or three months ago, they went out drinking with their friend group, and he never mentioned it to me. His excuses have been all over the place: first, he sent me a video of that night, claiming he didn‚Äôt tell me because I would ‚Äúoverreact.‚Äù Then, he said we didn‚Äôt even talk at thet time , which is a lie because we did. Finally, he said this happened in the summer when she wasn‚Äôt even in the country.

I showed him all the evidence that he‚Äôs lying, and now he‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs my fault he hides things. Afterward, he called my friend, and she rang me up, saying ‚Äúshame on me‚Äù for thinking anything was wrong.

They claim every time they see each other it's for the sake of our relationship 

Am I right to think something‚Äôs off? At most, I think they have a platonic relationship, but I still feel suspicious.

TL;DR: My boyfriend of 4 years has lied to me multiple times, and now I‚Äôve discovered he‚Äôs been hanging out with my close friend without telling me. I found out she‚Äôs been to his house, met his mother, and has worn his hoodie. They claim nothing is going on, but I‚Äôm starting to feel suspicious.

I do not have anything beyond a HS degree.

My current situation is that I have been in a Radiology Admin role for about the last 10 years or so. I worked my way up through the coffee shop at my local hospital and managed to land the role without a specific degree thanks to the connections I made. I now currently work remote from home doing the same type of job. I have been lucky that the job I have now would have normally asked for a degree but I had enough years in experience to bypass it. The pay is alright and I have a lot more free time but at this point I am wanting to see if I can achieve something better for myself.

My current role allows me to not interact with patients and I would like to keep it that way so while I thought about maybe becoming a CT tech or something I just don't think I could manage it in the long run. I had my fill with patients pretty early on. I am not limiting my options to medical only but am pretty much open to most things.

My primary concern is that at 37, if I work towards a degree in something I will be over 40 by the time I can start looking for a job in that field. I just have a hard time believing that I would be picked over someone a lot younger with more energy and more flexibility considering I have a family and mortgage to consider and worry about. Maybe I am just overthinking it and I know I have heard people say that you can always restart in your later years but I could use some help in what fields those opportunities may lie in.

I was in such a low place that I had no shame in trying to work on all the beautiful things I still held for her. She was a keeper. I crossed my boundaries and pushed for a second chance. When that didn‚Äôt work, I tried to just be her friend, hoping to prove myself and be there for her in a better way. I wanted to show even more gratitude for her, but she said no because of my actions and what she perceived as a lack of honesty.

I was shocked by how much my behavior aligned with BPD tendencies. What saddens me the most is that I never lied about major things, but I lied about my shame. I would hide phases where I consumed drugs or got blacked-out drunk because I feared judgment and felt ashamed. I never lied about women. I always spoke honestly about my encounters and never even thought about being with anyone else . I loved her too much. But I still broke her trust. I used Tinder during one of my low moments, matched with a random person, and told the girl I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything. After a few texts, the girl asked to meet for coffee. I went, but it lasted less than an hour. I felt ashamed and knew it was an unnecessary move. I came clean to my ex, but it jeopardized the trust between us. She didn‚Äôt take it well, and I was already hating myself and feeling unworthy, fearing she would leave. That fear caused me to push for the end with no contact.

Now, 15 months later, I‚Äôve started therapy and am working on building a complete picture of myself. Through therapy, I was asked if I had ever cheated. The truth is, I have very low sexual desires and never cheated or had the intention to cheat. My childhood trauma has made me fear becoming someone who cheats, and that‚Äôs why I still carry guilt for actions that felt like betrayal. I still want no one else, but I feel sad and frustrated because she was already helping me work through these issues. I wish I could tell her this truth now, but I can‚Äôt out of respect for her boundaries.

This process has taught me to work on myself and to be more honest, which is something I hadn‚Äôt fully practiced before. I‚Äôm building myself brick by brick, but I often feel the urge to speak my truth, and it hurts knowing I caused her pain. I truly care about her more than anyone else.

Any advice? I‚Äôm still trying to cope with these feelings and the thought of being selfish. I want to be there for her and work on a possible future, even do couples therapy, if that‚Äôs ever possible. After a while, or speak early For now, I‚Äôm just trying to rebuild and stay respectful of the boundaries",1,1734868681.0,letters,1,1.0,False

Before undergoing teeth whitening, it‚Äôs essential to have a consultation with your dentist. During this appointment, your dentist will evaluate your dental health and discuss your goals. This step is crucial in determining which method is best for you‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs in-office bleaching, take-home kits, or laser treatments. Understanding your options helps you feel empowered and informed.

### What Happens Before the Whitening Treatment

Several important steps occur before the actual whitening process begins:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Oral Examination:** Your dentist will check your teeth and gums for any issues that need to be addressed, such as cavities or gum disease.
- **Shade Assessment:** Your dentist will take note of the current shade of your teeth to track progress post-treatment.
- **Pre-Treatment Instructions:** Your dentist may provide specific guidelines, such as avoiding certain foods or beverages leading up to the appointment.

This pre-whitening stage is crucial. It ensures that your teeth are healthy enough for the procedure, boosting the chances of a successful outcome.

### The Whitening Procedure: What to Expect

On the day of your appointment, you'll likely go through the following steps:

3. **Timing:** The treatment typically lasts between 30 to 90 minutes, depending on the procedure.
4. **Rinse and Evaluation:** Once the treatment is complete, your dentist will rinse off the whitening agent and evaluate the results. You will see a noticeable difference immediately!

- **Avoid staining foods and drinks:** Be cautious with items like coffee, red wine, dark berries, and sauces.
- **Opt for lighter alternatives:** Consider using white sauces, lighter drinks, or fresh fruit for snacking instead of heavily pigmented options.
- **Stay hydrated:** Drinking water after consuming stain-inducing foods helps wash away residues that can cause discoloration.

### Practice Good Oral Hygiene

The foundation of maintaining a bright smile lies in excellent oral hygiene. Follow these simple routines:

- **Brush regularly:** Brush your teeth at least twice a day. Use a whitening toothpaste to help maintain your bright smile.
- **Floss daily:** Flossing removes plaque and food particles that can lead to stains in hard-to-reach areas.

- **Whitening pens:** A convenient option for quick touch-ups when you're on the go.

This from a variety of fresh beans, and using the single basket (12g) and double basket (18g).  
The useful range in the K6 will be from 42 clicks to 50 clicks from zero for these beans in the Picopresso.  
In the J-Ultra, the useful range is from ca 135 clicks to 150 clicks.  
This means, that even if you're not perfectly dialed in on a bean, you're usually still going to get something that tastes decent and will be creamy.



I've now had a Sage Dual Boiler (BDB / Breville Dual Boiler / Solis Triple Heat) for almost a week, and it seems much more finicky to make decent espresso. The results are all-or-nothing.  
Some beans will only work at ca 130 clicks (on J-Ultra), others at ca 102 clicks, and others at anything in between those values.  
If you're only a few clicks off, you'll either build no/weak pressure, or horribly tasting coffee/no espresso.

1hjwyob,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hjwyob/is_akka_superbiotics_worth_the_hype_for_liver_and/,Is Akka Superbiotics Worth the Hype for Liver and Gut Health?,"Hi everyone,

I recently came across something called **Akka Superbiotics**, and after using it for a while, I thought it might be helpful to share my honest experience. If you‚Äôve been struggling with things like low energy, unexplained weight gain, or stubborn belly fat, this post might be useful for you. I‚Äôll try to keep it balanced and break everything down in simple terms.

# What Is Akka Superbiotics?

Akka Superbiotics is a dietary supplement focused on improving liver health and gut function. At its core is a probiotic called **Akkermansia**, which, according to some research, plays a crucial role in metabolism and fat loss. The idea is that when your liver and gut are healthy, your body can naturally detoxify, burn fat more efficiently, and feel more energized.

I‚Äôve always been skeptical about supplements claiming to ‚Äúfix everything,‚Äù but I‚Äôve also dealt with fatigue, bloating, and frustratingly stubborn weight gain. So, I figured, why not give it a shot?

# Why Liver Health Matters (And How Akka Ties In)

Your liver does more than you might think‚Äîit‚Äôs responsible for clearing out toxins, breaking down fats, and regulating blood sugar. If your liver isn‚Äôt working well, no amount of dieting or exercising will give you long-term results. I learned this the hard way.

What intrigued me about Akka is its focus on **""Preserve Pasteurized Akkermansia""**, a specific preparation of Akkermansia that‚Äôs supposed to be easier on your gut and more effective. It‚Äôs paired with other ingredients like **Resveratrol** and **Quercetin**, which are known for their anti-inflammatory and fat-burning properties.

# My Experience Using Akka Superbiotics

When I started taking Akka, I didn‚Äôt expect miracles. I just wanted to see if it would help with some of my symptoms, like feeling constantly sluggish and dealing with bloating after meals.

**Week 1-2**:  
I didn‚Äôt notice much initially, but I did start feeling a slight improvement in my energy levels. I didn‚Äôt need that second cup of coffee to get through the day, which was a nice change.

**Week 3-4**:  
This is when I started seeing more noticeable changes. My bloating reduced significantly, and I felt lighter after meals. I also noticed I wasn‚Äôt craving sugary snacks as much, which was a huge win for me.

**Month 2**:  
The biggest change came in my overall mood and energy. I didn‚Äôt feel as weighed down or tired throughout the day, and my digestion was much smoother. I can‚Äôt say this was entirely due to Akka‚Äîlifestyle changes like eating fewer processed foods probably helped‚Äîbut it did feel like Akka gave me a solid boost.

# What I Liked

* **Noticeable Improvement in Digestion**: My bloating reduced, and I felt more regular, which is something I‚Äôve struggled with for years.
* **Energy Levels**: While it wasn‚Äôt like drinking an espresso, I definitely felt more steady energy throughout the day.
* **Reduced Sugar Cravings**: This was unexpected but very welcome. I didn‚Äôt feel as tempted to snack on junk food.

# What I Didn‚Äôt Like

* **The Price**: Akka is not the cheapest supplement out there. It‚Äôs worth it for some people, but if you‚Äôre on a tight budget, it might not be an easy choice.
* **Subtle Results**: Don‚Äôt expect overnight changes. It takes time to feel the effects, and it works best when paired with other healthy habits.

# Is Akka Superbiotics Right for You?

In my opinion, Akka Superbiotics is worth considering if you‚Äôve been dealing with issues like fatigue, bloating, or stubborn weight. However, it‚Äôs not a magic pill. It works best when combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise. Also, if you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs already taking good care of your gut and liver health, you might not notice drastic changes.

# Final Thoughts

For me, Akka Superbiotics wasn‚Äôt a life-changing miracle, but it did make a noticeable difference in how I feel day-to-day. My digestion is smoother, I have more energy, and I feel lighter overall. If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs been struggling with similar issues, it‚Äôs worth looking into. Just keep in mind that it‚Äôs not a replacement for a healthy lifestyle.

The roaster I bought the most was Wildkaffee it was the most consistent and had a huge selection of different origins and somehow special beans , including one of my favorites this year a Gesha coffee grown In Europe on the island of La Palma. 

We had a lot of great beans this year, it's incredible how many good roastes are in vienna, Austria and in reach via ordering online. 

The 7 coffees on the 2nd image were our ""favorites"" that stood out in some kind of way, this does not mean we didn't like the others!

J. HORNIG LAC KIVU Ruanda , tasted like raspberry , it was our first coffee of 2024

R√∂straum BLANCA NIEVES COSTA RICA (cofermented)- Cinnamon Sweets , incredible sweet cinnamon rolls 

R√∂steaum - Costa Rica white honey - grapes , and always good no matter the method this came out great every time.

Wildkaffee Brasil Aerobic - very juicy and sweet , Blood orange

John as Reindl - Muthigiini AB Kenya Gooseberry and toffee, winey with an incredible smooth mouthfeel

Sweet Beans - Ethiopia , fruity , winey, slight spices

Wildkaffee La Palma - yellow tropical fruits , slight tea floral notes, with the bonus that European coffee feels special.


In general I learned that naturals are the coffees that are the easiest to brew for me and that almost always taste good for me,  cofermented are fun but most of the time it's enough to taste 2 or 3 brews for the wow factor but as an everyday coffee they are too much. Last but not least washed the most tricky ones for me some where great , some tasted like nothing (probably because of my brewing style ). They are the hardest for me to get consistently but when done right they are incredible too. 

There are so many roasters on my list I'd like to try next year! 

Happy brewing everyone! ‚òï

Mushroom elixirs are a type of dietary supplement made from various types of mushrooms, such as reishi, chaga, cordyceps, lion's mane, and shiitake.

They are often sold in powder or liquid form and can be added to beverages such as coffee, tea, or smoothies.

Each mushroom typically has a unique set of health benefits. So combining mushrooms in an elixir can provide a wide range of benefits, such as boosting immunity, reducing inflammation, supporting brain function, and increasing energy.

Like  to the extend I tayght my younger brother how to write, even. I booked and took them to all medical appointments. I went to their parent/teacher meetings. I made sure they ate. When I got a job I took over all of their expenses. I went and met their friends, became their confidence. For my younger sister (24F), we went into the same field (nursing) and I pretty much had to hold her hand in helping her graduate.

I literally gave up my childhood and early twenties to for them. 

In my mother's eyes I was the Dajjal (the muslim version of anti christ, if you will). Every single thing I did was wrong. If I tried to instill some sort of life lesson to my younger siblings, I was overshadowing her a mother. She would go out of her way to discredit me. Like say the opposite of what I was telling them. For example, my younger brother (now 20) did very well in grade 10 for they bought him a ps4. He would play for like 13 hrs a day. Legitimately. Id tell to tone it down or make sure his chorses are done, hes still prioritizing school (he was a smart kid. So smart that he struggled to do his homework and it was beneath  him kind of smart, etc.) But NOPE. She told him to never to listen to me and do whatever he wanted. (Turns out in his first year of uni, he gamed so hard that he stopped going to class and was asked to leave in the first semester. My mother 100% blames me. I literally had nothing to do with him and his studies at this time. When asked why it was my fault she cannot answer. It just was.) Or with my younger sister, I wanted her to be more self-reliant. My mother wanted me to do everything for her but I always argued that that wasnt helpful. Id help her help herself but I wouldnt do it for her. For example going to staples to print out resumes (and make resumes even. Like why would I make a then 17 year old's resume?). Like my sister could go out, print them herself and hand out her own resume.  Or if there is a problem she should TRY to figure it out herself first and I'd help her otherwise. But my mother twisted my words/ meaning and painted me out to someone neglecting/ rejecting their siblings. And that I was this horrible selfish person who couldn't be trusted. 

Years went by. There are a handful of things that I still hold a grudge against my mother that I simply cannot let go of. 

1. I got married to one of her best friends son. The guy was a complete jerk. Like, i grew up pragmatic and this guy obnoxious and immature. I wanted out. Like he was emotionally and psychologically abusive. Typically my father- my walli- my protector- should have stood up for and my literally God given right to a divorce. But he was more worried about keeping face with the community. (Dont get me started on the stigma of muslim women divorcing. Apparently keeping a marriage going is solely on the woman [culturally]). My mother was worse, bc while my father failed me, she lied to me constantly. She kept telling me that she was on my side and how she would defend her daughter, and she was going to demand that divorce for me. If I ever questioned her, she would make up this HUGE dramatic notion how DARE I not trust my own mother. Turns out she was 100% lying, lol. She had no intention whatsoever. She was letting my father be the bad guy while she waiting for my tantrum to finish. Lol. I ended up speaking to a Muslim family mediator and let me tell yall, the guy was utterly appalled. Offered to try to straighten out my parents (but i decided not to. I still needed a place to stay lol)- the guy even reached back out months later to see how I was doing. I ended up representing myself and demanding a divorce myself and she gave me hell for it bc ""what kind of disgraceful woman tells someone they dont want to marry their son?!"". (Me, lol).

2. The final year I lived with her she treated me like a maid in a sense. Which I grew up so it wasnt too shocking. But it was Ramadan of 2020 and two of my siblings who moved out made a road trip from the other side of the country to visit. I worked the evening shift (230pm to 1130pm). The time we broke our fasts was around 10pm so i just thought id wait it out and just eat at home. But guess who didnt save any food for me when I got home! My mother, lol. There would literally be nothing left for me. Everyone else thought that food would be put aside bc thats literally what we have always done in the past. And since I got off at 1130 and with the ride home, it was pretty late and no one else was at the dinner table so they didnt realize until later (when my siblings found out made sure something was saved for me). But what was worse was that I would be in charge of the dishes afterwards of a meal that i didnt have. And bc we have a typical meal before sunrise  I was expected to make it for everyone. And since I was the one who typically did this since always, it wasnt so jarring. But my mother wanted fresh paratha. Which takes like 1.5 hrs just on that and 3 separate dishes for ""her guests"". Like a good 2.5 hours of cooking. My SIL who kept butting heads with my mother was told my brother to not do anything at my mothers house- should my mother take it the wrong way, she can speak to my brother instead. So SIL got so upset on my behalf and she decided she would do it with me. (My mother would scold me for not being able to do it myself). The kicker? We had a tennis table and everyone else was there playing while i was alone working. 

3. She gave all of the  credit of my hard work, tears, sweat and sacrifice with my younger siblings and gave them to my eldest sister. It baffles me, even now. My mother tells everyone that when she was working so many jobs it was my eldest sister who looked after everyone and raised them. This legitimately makes my blood boil. My eldest sister peaced out when she was in 9th grade. Like she was given a list of chores and make the younger siblings do it? She would. (My eldest sister loves to use that trend about eldest daughter in an aisan household trend and Im like- they arent talking about you. You stopped caring AGES ago. Like she never helped, never knew what was happening and push came to shove she would say her contribution was ""supervising"" us. We (the other siblings) made a pack that we would never ask her for a favour bc she literally gets so upset lol. Like a ride our drs appointment- with the promise that we'd bus back was a no go. If she could pick me up after i went grocery shopping so I wouldn't have to take 4 heavy bags on the bus was also a no. But my eldest sister was 100% down to give rides to her friends lol.  The type of sister to say ""you should do this for me, bc im your sister"". But when asked in return would say ""so what? Why should I help you?""). My mother would even give my things to my sister if it was newer/better quality. My eldest sister has gotten better now.

4. Zero respect for how I want to practice my religion. For example the hijab. We have disagreements about it. Like we wear when we're outside with around men who arent family. But my mother has issue with me wearing it at mixed parties/get together. Like make it make sense. What difference does it make to me? Like it seems like a joke to put it on daily but take it off for parties. Like either you wear it properly or dont. I get that everyone has their own journey/opinion. But I chose to wear my regardless of event. But my mother has a bad habit of taking photos in women only events and posting them publically. When confronted, shed say that SHE doesnt believe that its that important.

Anyways. My younger sister grew up exactly how you think she would have. She literally cannot do anything for herself. She always needs someone to save the day. Self reflection isnt a very weak point for her. You cannot even talk plainly to her or else she'll cry. Shes very entitled with support.

So that leads us here to now. 

My younger sister is getting married  in Feb 2025. She wants a stupidly big dolki/engagement party. But the thing is she doesn't actually have friends so shes reliant on my mother inviting her friends+ their families. 

But there are so many issues- expenses, labour to actually get stuff done, buffer between my sister and my mother, general  daily tasks as well etc,

Like, my sister wants to go pick out a dress, I take to a boutique and we spend a total of SEVEN hours only for my sister to say that our mother needs to be here and pick out the dress- but the heck am I here for? Why did I spend 7 bloody hours looking at dresses? 

Idk whats been getting to my sister but shes been being rude/ micro aggressive towards me. For example: after spending 7 hours she stays at my house. I offer to drop her off home. She says that our parents will scold her for coming home late. I said ill get some coffee and go in with her (whenever im there my mother scolds me regardless of anything else) so theyll be too busy to scold her. We get into a conversation where she says so busy at home and our parents dont acknowledge it. (But busy with what? The house isnt clean, youre not working, youre not studying- like what are you actually doing?) I made the comment of getting a job (she hasn't  worked since 2019) and work thatll take her our of the house so ofc our parents will accept  that as being busy. Plus she makes her own money and gets out of the house. She got upset at me for saying that. So she takes my cup of coffee out of the tray and places it in the cup holder and leaves (slams my car doors shut, too) when we get to our parents house. 

My sister wants a lavish wedding in a sense- what she sees on TV about western weddings. Like please  they have ONE event. We have a million. Its different . Also the bride does a lot of the stuff herself. 

But again. My sister cannot make it happen. And she needs someone else to buffer with my mother. Adfer years of living with her I know how to talk to her and brush she comments off. My younger sister despite living with my mother for years has no idea. My younger  sister decided that she wanted to learn our 

My mother is stressed bc the expenses are pilling up and the house is so dirty it has roaches. (To make ends meet my mother got renters for the rooms my older siblings and I used to take. The roaches came with them).

So now my mother wants me to visit her house to ""see her pain"". But like? Nah? I had stopped visiting her about a year after I moved out. I used to visit whenever i had a few days off but every time i came home, Id cook, clean and shop for the house before returning back to mine. I stopped doing that when she kept verbally harassing me (i think im using it right). Just insults upon insults if anything  went wrong- sister talked back, clearly my fault even from a different city. Her house is her house and her problem are not mine. 

Over the years she kept trying to get me to come over and clean up etc etc. Or give some money bc I am financially help off. But ive checked out. 

I could give my sister the wedding that she wants but I dont see why I should? Idk if this makes me terrible but im sick this. 

I feel like im not even a person to either of them. Like to my mother, she sees her childern as mini people she owns. We dont really matter at all to her. It doesnt matter that 4/6 are married (i got remarried) or that 3/4 married have childern.

My sister needs support but she has this outlook of- ""I needed help, so ofc you helped me. Who else was going to?""

I get that I am partially to blame as I have tried my best to come through for my family but I'm sick of it.  I think I truly resent my younger sister for how she treats me. I gave up so much for her and shes like  okay? What do you want me to do about it?. Idk what I want from her, but if I have to ask, i dont want it.

Now whenever they call, i miss it on purpose. When they text I spend hours inbetween responding. Before they even ask, im already rolling my eyes. 

Its like they cant do anything right in my eyes.

So basically, im just a 29 year old who hates everyone. Lol  idk. Im always annoyed and angry.",1,1734867187.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

Hoping to post a bit more on this board in 2025, so why not start now already with some of my favourite moments from 2024 :) Some of you might know me as I am a SONY Europe Alpha Ambassador for many years already! If you have any questions, feel free to ask!



[Sony A7RV - Sony 14mm GM](https://preview.redd.it/mem3oidkvd8e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0934948f2f56d077a81f2f74c791560b7594889)

Hands down my most spectacular moment of this year. I never thought this would ever be possible. On the 10th of May, I managed to capture (and see) overhead aurora in The Netherlands, above the classical dutch Windmills.

[Sony A7RV - Sony 16-35 GM II - Vertical panorama of 2 shots.](https://preview.redd.it/tei433yqvd8e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20641448696738d0aac2a3396985a8601a02dbf3)

I spend time in Disko Bay, Greenland every year where I guide groups to show massive icebergs with our little red sail boats. It really never gets boring with the spectacular midnight sun nights and amazing icebergs.

[Sony A1 II - Sony 16-35 GM II - Focus Stacked](https://preview.redd.it/kaakcpqzvd8e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ea7e38c813a655d97759842594a22c5eb12a557)

A tricky autumn shot with porcelain mushrooms. My favourite mushroom shot of the year. These are the kind of shots I live for as a photographer. Getting super low to the ground (even too low for the tripod) and seeing beauty like this unfold!

[Sony A7RV - Sony 100-400 GM](https://preview.redd.it/tqctwuu8wd8e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47f10beb30e0838fede2824fcaf711fc91b2a0a9)

Grand landscapes in Antarctica. Needles to say, it's a dream to visit Antarctica. This was my second time. I often like the rather 'simple' shots of the spectacular landscapes with the 'dark' weather conditions with just some patches of light.

[Sony A7RV - Sony 14mm GM](https://preview.redd.it/atgyso7gwd8e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83dc6b626041036cbdad2a1b06974973adf501fc)

I always wanted to photograph this waterfall in Iceland with great winter conditions, and earlier this year I managed to do so. This moment was special for me because I had to drive to this waterfall from the very east of Iceland. 6+ hours in snowstorms and icy roads. The forecast looked promising and where I stayed the weather was bad for several days. I took the decision and was rewarded around 2 AM at night with this beautiful show.

[Sony A7RV - Sony 90mm Macro](https://preview.redd.it/ca266b2uwd8e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=523dfcff00a35ae232024e81afac5044f14ae582)

People that know me know I love tulips. I am always looking for new angles and this is one that I had not done before: A tulip field in a dew drop. What made this extra special is that it was actually photographed in China, where I was on assignment to take photos of tulips instead of my homecountry!

[DJI Mini 3 Pro - Panorama](https://preview.redd.it/c1atksz1xd8e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6335321469721dd11ef6f739824a6fdcaae06ec9)

Ok, not a SonyAlpha shot but I still wanted to put this one in the list. An incoming huge shelf cloud nearing a little village that looks like a star from above. This shot was in my head for a while already, and when the weather cooperated I was finally able to take it.

[Sony A7RV - Sony 24-70 GM II](https://preview.redd.it/lu4zw1t9xd8e1.jpg?width=1917&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a12963c0748b4f5fc58d0cdb65b3d01e74fd23a8)

During this shot I was guiding a tour in Camargue, France. The weather was unusually 'bad' the whole week, but I did manage to get some 'unique' shots. This was one of the ones I took at the nearby salt flats. It was raining, but the dark sky in contrast with the unusual colours of the salt flats made for an interesting photo.

[Sony A7RV - Laowa 10mm](https://preview.redd.it/3h9hoykkxd8e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75adaa989817178000247b506481a05e2fe6d553)

I have been to this mountain many times, but never saw these crazy frozen structures. U used them as a foreground in this photo. It just proves that you can visit a location many times but conditions can always be different. And during this time, I had the 10mm full frame lens with me by Laowa, which was perfect to capture the grand landscape here.



[Sony A7RV - Sony 24-70 GM II - Focus Stack](https://preview.redd.it/xmxgkw6sxd8e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cefc955650570caaa4042e8e95098da42dbf30b8)

I can simply never get enough of my local landscapes. This was one of my favourite windmill shots of this year. I always aim to be on location well before sunrise. I think this was about 45 minutes before, with the beautiful twilight colours in the sky.

To add to this, the biggest project of the year was definitely my new coffee table book 'The Beauty of The Netherlands' in which I show 10 years of my portfolio from The Netherlands in a big size coffee table book. The book is almost sold out within only 2 months and I never expected it to be so successful world wide!

Anyway, happy to answer any of your questions. Thanks for looking!

1hjwpg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hjwpg5/first_solo_coffee_cupping_session_need_advice/,First Solo Coffee Cupping Session ‚Äì Need Advice!,"I‚Äôm planning my first solo coffee cupping session tomorrow and could use some advice. I‚Äôve attended a cupping session before, but with 10 cups in front of me, I got super overwhelmed and couldn‚Äôt properly analyze each cup.

Here‚Äôs my plan:

	‚Ä¢	I have three different coffee beans to try.

	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôll brew each coffee in its own mug.

	‚Ä¢	To keep it blind, I was thinking of writing numbers under each cup, shuffling them without looking, and then tasting. Does this sound like a good approach?

For those of you who‚Äôve done cupping on your own:

	1.	How do you rate or explore the taste?

	2.	Do you use tools like the flavor wheel (I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called)? Would you recommend it?

1hjwp4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/1hjwp4x/which_girls_dont_take_their_theme_too_seriously/,which girls don't take their theme too seriously themselves or are not taken seriously by others?,"1) Remilia as the representator of vampires being the embodiment of charisma. Certainly not leadership-wise. (Testify):

- PMISS has it Sakuya tells vampires around at times (might imply only Flandre or AKyuu's mistaken but that's been written).

- Patchouli is more of a friend's favors than a servant case and has her own servant koakuma/ Sakuya's serving coffee to her and Remilia alike.

- Flandre and Remilia never canonically met, it has been explained in CDS that flan was never locked in and you can't lock her inside even if you wanted to, she just had free pasta and toys for centuries which was...By extreme shut-in vampiric standards enough for her to almost never step outside.

*)Side note on flan, even the sages don't ask for Remilia's permission when they slip her out of the basement via a backdoor or a gap each time they need sth destroyed.

- Fairy maids aren't really...serving...At all. They're only as good as making their own meals and wash their clothes and are kept there as arestocratic decoration.Otherwise, Sakuya's cleaning after them and they're leaving and re-entering their posts all the time.

-Even Meiling has a manga-buddy relationship with Remilia (hisentensoku).


2)Cirno/(Clownpiece). See, fairies only live for pranks, there's nothing surprising in 80% of cirno and piece lives revolves around freezing your ass or burning your ass. However these two should have more going on for obvious reasons. 

- They both claimed to be the strongest fairy. They...met, said that to each other and just disbelieved each other and it ended there. No contests, no nothing. (And I'm stuck with 50-50 polls about these two all the time).

- Fairies in general, after hecatia and junko's brilliant idea of using fairies if all things to invade the lunar capital and okina's messing up the seasons via...fairies. Yeah fairies became a big deal afterwards. They, are literally the only thing the gods have competed for in the series with hecatia coming personally to claim surface fairies. So yeah in this case, it's the gods who're taking fairies more seriously than fairies do for themselves.

(Side note, fairies aren't supposed to be a serious  topic in touhou, I'm aware of that).


3) And...Yukari's set redlines. I don't see a single barrier or border or a deal than hasn't been infiltrated thus far. 

- Forget suika, an oni who's casually walking in the surface where in yuugi's case oni are t allowed on the surface nor does surface youkai are allowed downstairs. Kasen, another sage isn't being a great model for why oni shouldn't be a surface phenomenon. 

- The non-hostility contract signed with the SDM is either only implying Remilia or it's ""Non guided hostility"".As mentioned, the sages can't keep their hands off FLandre's demolishing skills so they end up asking for it before Flandre gets bored and start looking to destroy things herself.

- The border with the netherworld is a door in the sky which everyone flies over all the time with random phantoms inhabiting abandoned warehouses in the outskirts of the village, the great barrier dosebt stop gods from entering and leaving Gensokyo all the time, Gensokyo's only jurisdiction. The yama, they don't listen to sages, the sages don't listen to the yama, and then there's kanako...Yeah.


4) I don't need to expand on why magicians aren't taking Marisa seriously do I?


5) Myouren temple's supposed to represent Buddhism...

- Safe for it being a youkai temple which LE, Aya explained how youkai nature contradicts with the principles of Buddhism to the point of denying youkai's very existence. 

- Safe for Byakuren being sealed in Hokkai in the first place for not being a model Buddhist nun after fearing death with her little brother dying of old age in front of her so she used demonic magic for eternal youth. 

- Safe for almost a millenia of astetic seclusion in Hokkai apparently not being enough for byakuren to reach enlightenment. 


*) Well on the hand, that did made Byakuren as the model witch which did what Marisa still doesn't show the resolve to do. So there's Byakuren being the great grand magician at least.(But Buddhism isn't leading her nowhere).


6) HErmits and celestials. Miko is a saint for knowing how to play politics right to the point of gaining faith herself whereas her mentor Seiga who taught her taoism in the first place is a weeked necromancer. Right...

- Aside...The only celestial who graced Gensokyo with her presense was also the celestial who fell for eating all of their elixir after mistaking it for dessert who also happened to be the one who made it to heaven in the first place via VIP family status. And then you wonder why heaven started to attract oni like kasen.

There are new people to crypto in our Telegram  (and Subreddit) and new holders to Kendu.

There has been a lot of talk about Miazaki and token unlocks and ""suggestions and opinions"" as to what should and shouldn't be done. The reality is, that's completely up to Miazaki. It would be extremely stupid of him to exclusively use tokens for anything other than Kendu's benefit for a decent amount of time, literally his incentive as a large holder and project lead is to deliver, otherwise he is just shooting himself in the foot. 

People with this line of thinking also spread the wrong message to new members of the community who will be waiting for X, Y, and Z action and event instead of becoming and delivering X, Y, and Z themselves. 

Chads and whatever Miazaki delivers will be official products, but we also have Kendu Energy, Coffee, merch, kush, jewellery, and in the future hundreds of other official products and services created by the community under the Kendu umbrella.

There are early Kendu whales with similar amounts of supply who will undoubtedly be using it to benefit and grow Kendu in their own ways, directions, and localities too.

There should be no reliance or expectations on any one person. The only person you should have blind trust and faith in is yourself, because you can only guarantee the results that you deliver personally.

If we relied exclusively on Miazaki or any one person, Kendu wouldn't succeed or exist at all. It would be at zero.

Success at the scale we want it requires full activation from everyone doing everything they can under the Kendu umbrella and spreading like a fungus in every direction all of the time.

In the long run, Chads will just be a tiny piece of the Kendu collage. Shib isn't successful because of their onchain products. It's the reverse, their onchain products are successful because of Shib. And like Kendu, Shib is far beyond one person.

But self destructive behavior every 6 months more or less. Can I be misdiagnosed? Shall I go for a 2nd opinion? I need advice.","I have been diagnosed with BPD, and I was in a long-term relationship, which was my only one. I had a pattern of anger and a short temper toward my partner as I began to develop a fear of abandonment. I broke up with my ex during one of my low cycles. But deep down, I know she has been the greatest person I have ever known. I am beyond appreciative of her efforts, patience, and hard work, which I still speak about to this day.



It‚Äôs been almost 15 months, and not a single day has passed without her being on my mind. Initially, I had beautiful emotions about her. I was so grateful that I told myself, even if I never get married, those four years were the most beautiful of my life. She elevated my self-awareness with her support, love, and care. She was always there for me, even when I was hard to handle and stuck in my routines. She helped me with my work, encouraged me to work on my relationship with my mom, and pushed me to improve my career. She went grocery shopping with me, shared my interests even when they weren‚Äôt hers, took me to the hospital when I needed it, and took care of me. I have never felt peace anywhere else. She was my ride-or-die.



I often thought about how beautiful and platonic our connection was. Yet, I made many mistakes, and she was always understanding and forgiving. Her beauty, inside and out, led me to set strict rules in my mind to try and be a better partner. For a while, things went fine, but I have been regretting my actions since the day we broke up. Initially, I tried to tell myself, ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs meant to be, then let it be.‚Äù But as time passed, I started seeing how unstable my energy was in the relationship, compared to her constant, beautiful energy. She made me feel alive and full of life. That realization brought guilt. I felt I should have been better and began reflecting on my behavior. I told myself I needed to work on those issues because if I chose her, I couldn‚Äôt afford to hurt her. And I chose her.



When I thought deeply about it, I saw the patterns in my behavior but couldn‚Äôt pinpoint the main issue. I came to the realization that I needed to be honest with myself. So I tried to reconcile, but I approached it with uncertainty and fear of rejection, which came across as manipulative. I was in such a low place that I had no shame in trying to work on all the beautiful things I still held for her. She was a keeper. I crossed my boundaries and pushed for a second chance. When that didn‚Äôt work, I tried to just be her friend, hoping to prove myself and be there for her in a better way. I wanted to show even more gratitude for her, but she said no because of my actions and what she perceived as a lack of honesty.



I was shocked by how much my behavior aligned with BPD tendencies. What saddens me the most is that I never lied about major things, but I lied about my shame. I would hide phases where I consumed drugs or got blacked-out drunk because I feared judgment and felt ashamed. I never lied about women. I always spoke honestly about my encounters and never even thought about being with anyone else‚ÄîI loved her too much. But I still broke her trust. I used Tinder during one of my low moments, matched with a random person, and told the girl I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything. After a few texts, the girl asked to meet for coffee. I went, but it lasted less than an hour. I felt ashamed and knew it was an unnecessary move. I came clean to my ex, but it jeopardized the trust between us. She didn‚Äôt take it well, and I was already hating myself and feeling unworthy, fearing she would leave. That fear caused me to push for the end with no contact.



Now, 15 months later, I‚Äôve started therapy and am working on building a complete picture of myself. Through therapy, I was asked if I had ever cheated. The truth is, I have very low sexual desires and never cheated or had the intention to cheat. My childhood trauma has made me fear becoming someone who cheats, and that‚Äôs why I still carry guilt for actions that felt like betrayal. I still want no one else, but I feel sad and frustrated because she was already helping me work through these issues. I wish I could tell her this truth now, but I can‚Äôt out of respect for her boundaries.



This process has taught me to work on myself and to be more honest, which is something I hadn‚Äôt fully practiced before. I‚Äôm building myself brick by brick, but I often feel the urge to speak my truth, and it hurts knowing I caused her pain. I truly care about her more than anyone else.



Any advice? I‚Äôm still trying to cope with these feelings and the thought of being selfish. I want to be there for her and work on a possible future, even do couples therapy, if that‚Äôs ever possible. After a while, or speak early For now, I‚Äôm just trying to rebuild and stay respectful of the boundaries.",0,1734866174.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

1hjwkm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1hjwkm5/how_to_cope_with_loneliness/,How to cope with loneliness,"Hello everyone! Good morning, afternoon or night, wherever you are. My name is Inma and I'm a first-year PhD student from Spain, and I wanted to post about loneliness starting your PhD with the purpose of receiving advice on how to cope with it :)

  
I started to feel lonely in this academic path the moment my master's degree finished. All of my friends went back to their towns/villages all over Spain to pursue their English teaching paths. The thing is, I am the only one that is chasing her PhD, and although we are all still in contact with each other‚Äìwe meet for dinners, we still have our group chat, we read books together‚Äì, I feel like I do not have a palce to properly chat about my research.

I am researching about Young Adult Literature, specifically YA fiction and YA fantasy fiction. The field is... small, reduced, *petite* let's say. And when it comes to my university, I am the only one researching about that. The thing is, I do not care about it, because the main research path is literature *per se.* However, loneliness hit me the other day. We had sort of a welcome day/afternoon at my University for new PhD students: me. I had no friends going, of course, but I knew that some people I had talked with once or twice will be there. People who belong to my department. I entered the room, said hello to two or three people and sat down for the conferences. Once they were done, they invited us to have a coffee break, the perfect opportunity to talk to each other. If it weren't for the fact that I tried to integrate with a couple of conversations and failed. Everyone was talking about their researches, some teachers came to that day with their students or the other way round, some students came with their teachers. All in research projects or groups, things I wish I could be on. To sum this all up, I was left alone in a corner of the room, sipping my coffee for half an hour, staring at everyone in small groups yapping and laughing because they work together, they know each other, they share things in common.

That moment felt as if the Devil himself had come up from Hell, passed his arm around my shoulder and whispered: ""Told ya'"". If I have to be honest, at some point I felt some tears coming up to my eyes and I had to grab my phone and just scroll on Twitter for a minute or two. I had felt lonely before, but this was like the confirmation of it: Yes, girl! You are f\*cking lonely!

I just wish I could find people interested in my research to talk about it. I wish I could have someone to yap about PhD in general. I tried looking for people but we do not connect, we do not fit. I do not have a research group nor a project, I am investing my savings in my research. I unfortunately do not have any funding for this first year and I have had a hard time looking for grants and contracts.

Guess I am open to receiving any critics, advices, friendship?, or even a pat on the back. I know it is only my first year, but I do not want to be like this for four or five more years.

If you have reached the end of this post, thank you so much for reading. For listening to me.

- Quick customer service when nearby areas were having network issues, etc. 
- Only 5 minutes to set up an account via their app straight from your phone! So no need to visit a branch and take time out of your busy day
- Ability to create multiple ‚Äòsavers‚Äô accounts to visualise your money better, and a respectable interest rate on up to five of these (calculated daily and distributed monthly) 

At the moment there‚Äôs a promo if you sign up using an existing customer‚Äôs referral link - **we both get $20!** For practically no work at all! That‚Äôs a free small meal (or cheeky beer) right there. 

There‚Äôs no fees to hold or create an account, so you don‚Äôt have to fully co-opt their system or switch to it as your main bank. You can just make the account, make yourself some money and be done with it!

Hello r/iosapps community! üëã

I needed a simple app to manually track and manage my spending, including credit card payments, bank transfers, and cash expenses. Manually recording expenses helps me stay aware of my spending habits and manage them effectively. This led me to launch the Money Keeper app in July, and I first introduced it here on r/iosapps in September üôè

Thanks to the incredible feedback from many of you, I‚Äôve been working on updates based on your suggestions. Recently, I added a much-requested feature: the ability to set the calendar start day based on your payday üìÜ. Your continued support and feedback mean the world to me! üëç

\---

# üí° What is Money Keeper?

\- An app that lets you view your income and expenses at a glance on a monthly basis.

\- Manage regular expenses and recurring (fixed) expenses separately.

\- Set the calendar by payday.

\- Supports Mac, iPad and iPhone apps with fast synchronization ‚ö°Ô∏è

\- Monthly Summary: Visualizes your expenses.

\- Ability to create and customize expense and income categories.

\- Simplicity that allows you to focus solely on managing expenses.

\- Free with limited features. Supports a reasonably priced one-time membership for full features.

\- No ads, no data collection.



\---

The app is still in its early stages, and there‚Äôs plenty of room for improvement. However, I‚Äôm committed to developing it with the help of users like you, to make it a useful tool for those looking to manage their expenses manually. üëç

I‚Äôm carefully recording all the feedback I receive and using it to gradually add new features. If you give it a try and have any suggestions, feel free to leave a comment üí¨.

A huge thank-you to everyone who‚Äôs started using Money Keeper to manage your spending. I hope you stay healthy üí™ and have a wonderful holiday season üéÑ‚ú®.

1.1 Allow people to upload an audio preview of the sound obtainable with that NAM Profile

1.2 Once done, add a filter to the search ‚ÄúAudio preview available‚Äù

 

2. Add the possibility to tip people

 

3.1 Create 2 kind of users: standard, pros. At first it could be just a tag but gradually differentiate them. The be called a Pro, you just need to prove you are one (several ways to do it). I prefer Pro to a generic ""Business"" so to differentiate someone who does work in the field.

3.2 Paying users will have a better looking page. Both standard and Pros can do it.

3.3 Add a filter to the search, to differentiate Standard and Pro

 

 4. Improve the search filters. Now when you enter a category like ‚ÄúPedals‚Äù you can only sort out items with ‚ÄúOldest / Newest‚Äù which is not useful at all. Add most voted at least.

5. Overall improve the rating system so the best can really shine out. The number of downloads and stars it not that helpful.

**Looking Back on 2024 in Kdramaland**

We invite all of you to look back upon 2024 with us at the many things that took place in kdramaland and Korea and share your thoughts and reflections on this past year. To get us started, we have curated a list of events and news from this past year. The following list of events and news has been curated with consideration of how the events/news affected kdramaland and our community. While we welcome input from the community in the comments, we do ask that community members do not make the curation of this list into a political or ideological issue. If there are any events or news that you feel should be remembered, please feel free to share in the comments!

**In 2024**

THE WORLD welcomed a new year amidst political turmoil in various parts around the globe and changing dynamics were anticipated as this year was one of [important elections](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3293126) around the world. And with the turn of the year, it seemed that the COVID era was now truly part of the past as more things have returned to normalcy, like the [summer Olympics in Paris](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240727000351315) where Korea eventually won [13 gold medals](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240812000300315) and increased attendance of [performing art events](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240430005900315).

In Korea, amongst the country‚Äôs new year resolutions seems to be one to reduce public alcohol consumption as drinking alcohol in most places designated as alcohol-free zones will be [subject to fines](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3296344). Will this be the beginning of the end of kdrama scenes of drowning one‚Äôs sorrows by the river or at the park? Meanwhile *maekju‚Äôs* (beer) best friend fried chicken was voted the [most popular K-food overseas](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3296959). And ramyeon, specifically the Bulduk brand, made news headlines for being [too spicy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3418548). K-food is not the only thing receiving lots of interest and love overseas for data released later in the year showed that K-pop industry's overseas sales surpassed 1 trillion won (US$722.28 million) in 2023, marking the first time the revenue figure has [exceeded 1 trillion won](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240724003300315).

Nature also featured heavily in 2024 headlines starting with a [85 cm tsunami](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3293839) at the beginning of the year, marking the first time South Korea has experienced a tsunami on its coasts since July of 1993. Then there was the flock of about [200 mandarin ducks](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3304533), a symbol of love and fidelity in Asia, spotted in Seoul. As the Han River froze later this year, it was an interesting chance to reminisce on how it used to be the [heart of winter sports](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3321412), especially as the [Winter Youth Olympics](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240119009451315) was held in Gangwon this year. And then in summer, Korea [experienced its hottest June ever](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3422165) and kept breaking records for the number of [tropical nights](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240901001400315).

Weather was not the only hot thing in Korea as the K-content industry remained a hot topic of interest and growth. This year saw Naver's Webtoon Entertainment make its hot debut on Wall Street with its [IPO on Nasdaq](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240628001151320) while tvN‚Äôs broadcast ratings record was broken by ‚ÄúQueen of Tears‚Äù, which recorded [24.85% for its final episode](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240429008000315). Also heating up is the war against illegal content distribution as the [government teams up with Interpol](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-08-19/culture/gamesWebtoons/Govt-teams-up-with-Interpol-for-major-operation-against-Kcontent-pirates/2115456) for operations against K-content pirates. And while there are victories like [this one](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3325031) and [this one](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-08-27/culture/gamesWebtoons/Agitoon-largest-illegal-webtoon-sharing-site-shut-down-in-government-operation/2121398), the war is still ongoing as the mod team knows too well! Another war being fought in the content industry is one against rising costs and consumer dissatisfaction as [‚Äústreamflation‚Äù](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3372486) has resulted in an exodus of subscribers.

Those needing a break from drama viewing can consider turning to reading as Koreans celebrated [Han Kang](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20241010011800315) becoming the first Korean winner of the Nobel Prize in literature. Her most recent works have addressed the historical traumas and wounds of modern Korean history, which is a topic also addressed by the historical film ""12.12: The Day"" that swept the grand prize, best film, and best actor in the film category at the [60th Baeksang Arts Awards](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240507008300315). Another trauma and wound in spotlight this year especially is that of the [Sewol ferry sinking](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3370775), which happened on April 16, 2014, making this year the tenth anniversary of the tragedy. May history teach all of us important lessons so that we can do better in the future.

As time passes, parting is inevitable and this year Korea said goodbye to giant panda [Fu Bao](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240403002051315) as she returned to China and the country‚Äôs last Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft, operated by Asiana Airlines, as it completed its [final flight](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-03-25/business/industry/Koreas-last-Queen-of-the-Skies-Boeing-747-makes-final-flight/2010222). A law was passed [banning consumption of dog meat](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240109004352315), paving the way for ending a practice that has fallen out of favor in recent decades. Korea also said hello to new things like [seatless subway trains](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240109003100315), a new [Haechi](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3319416), and a slightly increased new [minimum wage](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3293829). In sports, Major League Baseball came to [South Korea for the first time](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240321011600315) and the [Pikki Pikki dance](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3478291) went viral. Korea welcomed back a rare and culturally significant ‚Äú[sarira](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240206004700315),‚Äù bead-shaped bodily relics of spiritual masters, from a Boston museum after 15 years of negotiations. This year also saw the return of K-pop legend Cho Yong-pil with his [20th studio album](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20241022000800315), marking the 74-year-old artist's first studio album in 11 years. If his name is unfamiliar to you, that does not mean [his music](https://youtu.be/orRn4WzWr88?si=GXIaYUR78N4tp2vg) is necessarily unfamiliar to you as his songs have made numerous ‚Äòcameos‚Äô in kdramas over the years. Meanwhile, have a peek at his latest title song‚Äôs [MV](https://youtu.be/bo_dfa1p950?si=hw3r3kso85qzcUZp) and see which beloved actors you spot!

Speaking of achievements, this year Jamsil Station on Seoul's Subway Line No. 2 has replaced Gangnam Station of the same line as the capital's [busiest station](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240523002600315) while Korean trot star Lim Young-woong's concert film became [highest-grossing concert film](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3828462) of all time. On the business side, Hyundai Motor Group appointed its [first non-Korean CEO](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10010957), and Navar Papago, the Korean online portal operator's artificial intelligence-powered translation service, [topped 20 million users](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2024/12/419_376242.html). Many also rejoiced when, in a [landmark ruling](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3436930), South Korea‚Äôs Supreme Court ruled in favor of a same-sex couple, who sought to receive the same spousal coverage as heterosexual couples from the National Health Insurance Service. And Korea truly cemented its reputation as a country in love with coffee when the [number of coffee shops](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2024/12/419_377739.html) surpassed 100,000 ‚Äî which is nearly double the combined number of the four major convenience store chains in the country. So we know statistically, Seoul has *way more* than one coffee shop unlike how it may seem at times in the kdramas we watched.

To talk further of how kdramas and real life issues in Korea collide, as the country celebrated its [decreased smoking rate](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3295902), the issue of [portrayal of smoking in OTT dramas](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3318652) have lighted up. Another issue the country struggles with and is often portrayed in kdramas is that of school violence. This year, the government announced that [all 10 national universities of education](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3387184) have disqualified high school students with a history of violence from applying, therefore barring their paths to becoming teachers ‚Äî an action that is part of government‚Äôs increasingly stronger response against bullying. Also in the spotlight in news headlines and kdramas are the issues of [‚Äúsafe breakups‚Äù](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240519000200315) and deepfake technology, especially [deepfake sex crimes](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-09-01/national/socialAffairs/Govt-public-and-parents-on-alert-as-deepfake-sex-crimes-rise/2122649) which is on the rise. In both instances, women are mainly the victims and the phenomenon have highlighted some deep-rooted social issues in Korea. Meanwhile, despite kdramas portraying hypothetical reunifications of Korea, in reality, skepticism toward unification with North Korea is rising in South Korea and support of reunification has fallen to an [all-time low of 36.9%](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3486476). And finally to give a shout out to all the chaebols in our kdramas, the [real life drama](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240602001000320) of the ""most expensive divorce suit"" in South Korea's history between SK Chairman Chey Tae-won and his estranged wife is making our kdramas seem like child‚Äôs play.

What absolutely is not child‚Äôs play are the events of December 3, 2024 when South Korean President declared emergency martial law (full translation of declaration [here](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10012293)). Though he declared its end [just six hours later](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10012331), the chaos it caused and its reverberations are still felt today. For those that want a timeline, [here is one](https://www.koreaherald.com/timeline)^(Last accessed 2024DEC21). And this [breakdown of the issue](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10017160) by is an informative read.

Unlike past years‚Äô posts, this year‚Äôs post is ending on a rather somber note. At this point in time, we would like to remind our community that as much as we love kdramas, we have to also remember and recognize South Korea as a country and its people as fellow human beings. While our moderation approach means that our subreddit‚Äôs conversations are focused on the kdramas and not the politics of South Korea, that does not mean we, as a community and as individuals, should prioritize our need to watch kdramas above being empathetic to the current realities in South Korea. A small way to demonstrate that empathy for fellow beings is to not complain about broadcast delays during times like these. Broadcast delays are only a mere nuisance that can and will be rectified, it is nothing compared to the political turmoil experienced in South Korea earlier this month. In short, the world does not revolve around our need for kdramas.

So as we bid farewell to 2024 and welcome 2025, let us all appreciate that we have the privilege of watching kdramas and show more empathy and appreciation for the people and the country that have given all of us so much entertainment and joy.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Let's be honest, folks, four walls and a roof do not a home make. It's the laughter, the love, the shared moments that transform a mere building into a sanctuary. And, let's face it, few creatures contribute to that cozy, loving atmosphere quite like a dog. They're not just pets; they're family, confidants, furry therapists, and four-legged comedians all rolled into one. From their wet noses nudging your hand to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of their tail against the floor, dogs enrich our lives in ways we can hardly articulate. This article delves deep into that special bond, exploring why ""a house is not a home without a dog."" We'll cover everything from the emotional benefits to the practical advantages, touching on topics like companionship, security, and even the surprising ways dogs boost our physical health. So, grab a cup of coffee, settle in with your furry pal, and let's dive into the wonderful world of dog ownership.

### Companionship: The Heart of the Matter

Having a bad day? Your dog doesn't care. They're just thrilled to see you. That unconditional love and unwavering support are invaluable, providing a constant source of comfort and joy. They‚Äôre always there for a cuddle on the couch, a game of fetch in the park, or simply a listening ear (or a tilted head) when you need to vent about your day. Think about it: who else greets you with such unbridled enthusiasm, every single time you walk through the door? It‚Äôs this constant companionship that truly elevates a house to a home. A dog provides a sense of belonging, a feeling that you're never truly alone, even when the world outside feels chaotic and overwhelming. This is especially vital for those living alone, for whom a dog can be a lifeline against loneliness and isolation.

- **Unconditional Love:** A dog‚Äôs love is pure and unwavering, regardless of your flaws or mistakes.
- **Constant Companionship:** They‚Äôre always there, ready for a cuddle or a play session.
- **Emotional Support:** Dogs offer a sense of comfort and security, especially during tough times.

### Security: More Than Just a Bark

Sure, a dog's bark can deter burglars, but their contribution to security goes far beyond that. They provide a sense of safety and peace of mind, knowing that there's a loyal guardian watching over you and your loved ones. Even the smallest dog can make a big difference, alerting you to unusual noises or visitors. This heightened sense of security allows you to relax and truly feel at home, knowing that your furry friend has your back. It‚Äôs not just about physical protection; it‚Äôs about that inherent feeling of safety and comfort that comes with knowing you're not alone.

1. **Deterrent to Intruders:** A barking dog can scare off potential burglars.
2. **Early Warning System:** They can alert you to unusual sounds or activity.
3. **Increased Peace of Mind:** Knowing your dog is there provides a sense of security and comfort.

### Health Benefits: A Walk in the Park and So Much More

Believe it or not, owning a dog can actually improve your physical health! From encouraging regular exercise (those daily walks add up!) to lowering blood pressure and reducing stress, the health benefits of dog ownership are well-documented. Playing with your dog releases endorphins, those feel-good chemicals that boost your mood and reduce anxiety. And let‚Äôs not forget the social aspect; walking your dog provides opportunities to connect with other dog owners, building a sense of community and reducing feelings of isolation. Who knew that furry friend could be so good for you?

- **Increased Physical Activity:** Daily walks and playtime keep you active and healthy.
- **Reduced Stress and Anxiety:** Interacting with a dog can lower blood pressure and release endorphins.
- **Enhanced Social Interaction:** Dog parks and walks provide opportunities to meet new people.

A House Is Not a Home Without a Dog: The Emotional Connection
-------------------------------------------------------------

The bond we forge with our dogs runs deep. They become an integral part of our lives, woven into the fabric of our daily routines and cherished memories. They're there for the big moments, the small victories, and everything in between. They celebrate with us, grieve with us, and offer a non-judgmental ear (or paw) when we need it most. It's this profound emotional connection that truly sets the dog-human relationship apart. They're not just pets; they're family.

### Routine and Responsibility: The Gift of Structure

Having a dog instills a sense of routine and responsibility. From feeding and walking to grooming and training, caring for a dog provides a framework for your day, offering a sense of purpose and accomplishment. This can be especially beneficial for people struggling with depression or anxiety, as it provides a reason to get out of bed and engage with the world. It's amazing how the simple act of caring for another living being can bring so much meaning and joy to our own lives.

### A House Is Not a Home Without a Dog: The Joy of Play

Let's not forget the sheer joy and laughter that dogs bring into our lives! Their playful antics, silly expressions, and boundless enthusiasm are infectious, reminding us to embrace the simple pleasures and find the humor in everyday life. Whether it's a game of fetch in the park, a tug-of-war with a favorite toy, or simply watching them chase their tail in dizzying circles, dogs remind us to not take ourselves too seriously. They bring a lightness and levity to our homes, turning ordinary moments into cherished memories.

Furry Friends Forever: Celebrating the Dog-Human Bond
-----------------------------------------------------

From their unwavering loyalty to their infectious enthusiasm, dogs enrich our lives in countless ways. They offer companionship, security, and a profound emotional connection that transforms a mere house into a true home. They teach us about unconditional love, responsibility, and the importance of living in the moment. So, the next time you look at your furry friend, remember that they‚Äôre not just a pet; they‚Äôre family, a vital piece of the puzzle that makes your house a home. They are the embodiment of joy, loyalty, and unconditional love, reminding us daily of the simple pleasures in life. And honestly, what more could you ask for? Isn't it remarkable how much love and joy one furry creature can bring into our lives?

### Puppy Love and Beyond: A Lifetime of Memories

The journey of dog ownership is filled with moments of pure joy, from the clumsy puppy stage to the wise old age of a senior dog. Each stage brings its own unique set of challenges and rewards, creating a tapestry of memories that will last a lifetime. From the first time your puppy learns to sit to the comforting weight of their head resting on your lap in their twilight years, every moment with a dog is precious. It‚Äôs a journey of shared experiences, unconditional love, and unwavering companionship. And isn‚Äôt that what makes a house a home?

Conclusion
----------

In the end, it's not about the square footage or the fancy furniture; it‚Äôs about the love, laughter, and companionship that fills the space. And no one brings those elements into a home quite like a dog. They‚Äôre more than just pets; they're family, confidants, and furry therapists, reminding us daily of the simple joys in life. So, while a house may provide shelter, it‚Äôs the unconditional love and unwavering loyalty of a dog that truly transforms it into a home. They bring a warmth, a vibrancy, and a sense of belonging that is simply irreplaceable. So, if your house feels a little empty, maybe it‚Äôs time to consider adding a four-legged friend to the family.

1hjwdso,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreshBreathChampion/comments/1hjwdso/celiac_disease_and_bad_breath_understanding_the/,Celiac Disease and Bad Breath: Understanding the Connection and Solutions,"""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten consumption, can manifest in a myriad of ways, some more obvious than others. While digestive issues are the hallmark of this condition, many individuals experience seemingly unrelated symptoms, leaving them scratching their heads and searching for answers. One such perplexing symptom is bad breath, a social hurdle that can significantly impact self-esteem and quality of life. Let's delve into the intricate relationship between celiac disease and bad breath, exploring the underlying mechanisms, potential contributing factors, and ultimately, how to manage this often-overlooked aspect of the disease. This deep dive will equip you with the knowledge to navigate this sensitive issue and regain your confidence.

Celiac Disease Bad Breath: Unmasking the Connection
---------------------------------------------------

We often associate bad breath, or halitosis, with poor oral hygiene or specific foods. However, sometimes the root cause lies much deeper. In the case of celiac disease, gluten ingestion can wreak havoc on the digestive system, leading to a cascade of events that can ultimately contribute to bad breath. Imagine a domino effect, where one toppled domino triggers the next. Gluten, for someone with celiac disease, is that first domino, setting off a chain reaction impacting gut health and, surprisingly, oral health.

### The Gut-Mouth Connection: A Two-Way Street

The connection between gut health and oral health is well-established. Think of your gut as the control center for much of your body's functionality, influencing everything from immunity to, yes, even your breath. When the gut is inflamed and irritated, as it is in celiac disease, this inflammation can manifest in various ways, including oral issues like bad breath. But why?

1. **Malabsorption and Nutrient Deficiencies:** Celiac disease damages the small intestine's lining, preventing proper nutrient absorption. This malabsorption can lead to deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals, impacting overall health and potentially contributing to bad breath. Think of it like trying to build a house with faulty bricks ‚Äì the foundation is weak, and the structure suffers.
2. **Bacterial Overgrowth:** When the gut's delicate ecosystem is disrupted, it can create an environment conducive to the overgrowth of harmful bacteria. These bacteria can produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), notorious for their unpleasant odor. It's like a garden overrun with weeds ‚Äì the balance is thrown off, and the results aren't pretty.
3. **Dry Mouth:** While not directly caused by celiac disease, malabsorption can indirectly contribute to dry mouth, a common cause of bad breath. A lack of saliva reduces the mouth's ability to wash away food particles and bacteria, creating a breeding ground for odor-causing microbes.

### Beyond the Gut: Other Contributing Factors

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

While the gut plays a primary role in celiac disease-related bad breath, other factors can also contribute:

- **Sinus Issues:** Inflammation triggered by celiac disease can sometimes extend to the sinuses, leading to post-nasal drip, which can cause bad breath. It's like a leaky faucet ‚Äì the constant drip, drip, drip can become a source of unpleasant odors.
- **Medications:** Some medications prescribed for celiac disease or related conditions can have dry mouth as a side effect, exacerbating bad breath.
- **Dietary Choices:** Even on a gluten-free diet, certain foods can contribute to bad breath. Garlic, onions, and coffee are common culprits, and limiting their intake can be beneficial.

Celiac Disease Bad Breath: Tackling the Issue Head-On
-----------------------------------------------------

So, how can individuals with celiac disease address this often-embarrassing symptom? Thankfully, several strategies can help.

### 1. The Cornerstone: Strict Gluten-Free Diet

The most crucial step in managing celiac disease-related bad breath, and indeed all celiac disease symptoms, is adhering to a strict gluten-free diet. Removing gluten allows the gut to heal, addressing the root cause of the problem. It's like fixing the leaky pipe ‚Äì once the source of the leak is repaired, the surrounding problems begin to resolve.

### 2. Supporting Gut Health: Probiotics and Prebiotics

Probiotics and prebiotics are like superheroes for your gut. They help restore the balance of good bacteria, promoting a healthy gut microbiome and potentially reducing bad breath. Probiotics introduce beneficial bacteria, while prebiotics provide the ""food"" these bacteria need to thrive. It's like tending a garden ‚Äì nurturing the good plants helps crowd out the unwanted weeds.

### 3. Hydration is Key: Staying Well-Hydrated

Drinking plenty of water helps combat dry mouth, reducing the likelihood of bad breath. Water acts like a rinse cycle for your mouth, washing away debris and bacteria. Think of it like a car wash ‚Äì regularly rinsing keeps things clean and fresh.

### 4. Oral Hygiene: A Daily Ritual

Maintaining good oral hygiene is essential. Brushing twice daily, flossing regularly, and using a tongue scraper can significantly reduce odor-causing bacteria in the mouth. It's like sweeping and mopping your floors ‚Äì consistent cleaning keeps things tidy and smelling fresh.

### 5. Seeking Professional Help: When to See a Doctor

If bad breath persists despite these efforts, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional. They can rule out other underlying conditions and offer personalized advice. It's like calling in a specialist ‚Äì sometimes you need expert help to diagnose and address a persistent problem.

Celiac Disease Bad Breath: Reclaiming Your Confidence
-----------------------------------------------------

Dealing with celiac disease can feel like navigating a minefield, with unexpected symptoms popping up at every turn. Bad breath, though often overlooked, can significantly impact self-esteem. By understanding the connection between celiac disease and bad breath, and by implementing the strategies outlined above, individuals can regain control and confidently navigate social situations without fear of embarrassment. Remember, managing celiac disease is a journey, not a destination. With the right tools and knowledge, you can tackle even the most challenging symptoms and live a full and vibrant life. Don't hesitate to seek support from healthcare professionals and online communities ‚Äì you're not alone on this path.

Conclusion
----------

Celiac disease bad breath may seem like a minor issue compared to other symptoms, but its impact on an individual's quality of life should not be underestimated. By addressing the root cause ‚Äì gluten ingestion ‚Äì and incorporating supportive strategies such as probiotics, hydration, and good oral hygiene, you can effectively manage this often-embarrassing symptom. Remember, maintaining open communication with your doctor is key to navigating the complexities of celiac disease and ensuring your overall well-being. You deserve to feel confident and comfortable in your own skin, and managing bad breath is one step towards achieving that goal.",1,1734865253.0,FreshBreathChampion,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone,

I'm an 18-year-old preparing for class 12 exams in March. Over the past two years, my sedentary lifestyle while studying for the JEE (enegenring exam) has caused my weight to jump from 80-85 kg to 125 kg. My routine was unhealthy: studying 12 hours a day, no sleep pattern, regular coffee at night, and no physical activity.

Currently, I'm on the OMAD diet, consuming 2000 calories daily (tracked via MyFitnessPal), taking 120-130 grams of protein(from eggs and whey and other sources too), doing 7.5K steps, and 15-20 minutes of mild running/jogging daily(which burns around 450-500 calories per day).I know a calorie deficit without strength training can lead to muscle loss, but I can only join a gym after mid March.

My BMR is 2161, and I'm 125 kg at 165 cm tall. A screenshot of my TDEE is 3020. Is this a good approach to weight loss? Any tips or advice would be appreciated.",1,1734865226.0,loseit,1,0.67,False

Hi everyone,

I'm an 18-year-old preparing for board exams in March. Over the past two years, my sedentary lifestyle while studying for the JEE has caused my weight to jump from 80-85 kg to 125 kg.

No big drama, just little incidents that add upp.","I apologised for formating, i am on mobile and writing : not native english speaker and have dyslexia/ dysortgraphia. I am trying my best. 

I am LC / NC with my older sister for a couple of year ) .  It might be long read . Do not bother  if too much for you. I tend to have runnon sentence especially if emotionnal. 
It actually is the 2 christmas we won‚Äôt spend together. As i said : no huge fight, no big drama.  
For context, The situation breaks my heart because we were really close in our teens/ twenties. We had a ¬´¬† you and me against the world¬†¬ª relationship for a long time. My sister was super generous with me for so long and i am super gratefull for it .  

I‚Äôll add: our parents are/ were both emmotionnally immature. Our dad in avoidant way and our mum in a dependant way. We were both parentified. My sister, as the eldest, took care of me and was asked to be responsible too young. I was more made to be my mum‚Äôs emotionnal support pet and had to regulate her √©motions. In a way i was a favourite: i received more attention and compliment. But it had it‚Äôs really bad side: my mom beat me more, if i tried to be myself or did my own thing and was unavailable to my mom demands it lead to emotionnal outburst. 
It culminated when i left for college. My mum pursued me in her car , almost running me over because she was so inraged that i chose my own path over the one she had designated for me.  Among the first incident , my sister was jealous of what she saw as advantages even thought from around 10 yearq old i would ask our mom to stop it  when i could. Over the last years, My sister told me to get over the violence, ¬´¬†it was‚Äônt that bad, I( sis) had it worst¬†¬ª

When Sis became a mom , she chose a close friend as godmother and implicated some friend in the care but always refused my help. 
I work in healthcare. During my study and work i have handled infant , i am by no mean dangerous to them. I have taken care of friends kid and infant and nothing bad ever happend. I had to beg to be included in family outings to spend time with her kid. I offered many time to babysit at her place  but she refused and prefered friends or nannies. Which hurts. She always denied it and never gave a reason. The only time i was allowed to care for  kid was when i was going trought a separation and i had temporarlly moved into a friends under construction flat while trying to find a better space. I was terrified the whole time that day her 3 year old was there because of all the dangerous material and tools everywhere in the flat. At some point , i just gave up trying to have a aunt/ nibling relationship. 

An other ordeal is christhmas gifting. She has a step family ( 2 adults steps kids 20 and 23 + fil and mil ) we , mum and i, see them max twice a year and  have no relationship to them except polite chit chat at familly gathering. I am okay to get gifts to her kid, her husband, and our cousins. She demands that my mum and I get a gifts to each of them. 
Her husband is well off and the family is used to pricey gift. The first year, i bought  christmas rose for the ladies and choclate for the gents. It was  snubbed by her adult step kid  that abandonned them when they left and she was unhappy i did not more get gift to nibling. In ou culture they are other event were you get gifts to kids before ( like sint niklaas and befana) and i did not get any . I was unable too . I am not poor but i am prudent with money , i am single and the seperation left me able to buy my own place but i can‚Äôt afford luxuries in order to do so. My mum is retired she keeps a small activity in the side to be able to afford outing and gifts for my nibling, my sis and i. She has health issues. She i not poor but i would prefer she keeps her money to be comfortable.. I can do gift for my closely related family an friend. I do not wich to spend a huge chunk of my gifts budget for stranger. I do not want gift from them. I begged for 3 years to please exchange gifts between ourselves and do christmas lunch without gift exchange . My mum asked the same, she would rather spoil her only grand kid. The last christmas i spend with sis and her family , she called me triumphantly  , 3 days before christmas, that i was allowed not have gift for her extended familly. I told her i had bought everything already. She got mad and yelled on the phone. I was having coffee with a friend. Most coffee shop heard it, it was not on speaker phone, i was mortified. On christmas day, i offerd all my gifts, and received from sister and. Mum. The other gave none saying that they were told no need for it. I guess they do all their gift shopping 2 days before? What was i supposed to do with nice gift i had bought specifically for them, not wanted to be snubbed again for generic affordable gifts. Get gift cards from shop i do not usually go too? Because i would not get money back and naively thoutgh that 3 days before meant the great gift exchange would not be cancelled on such short notice. And wishing to avoid any further drama if i came empty handed. 

A previous incident, she asked  me to be her  witness to her wedding. I was tasked with organising her bachelorrette. It was nightmarish. It was at the end of lockdown. Her friends came with crazy ideas that Sister disliked. She was not in the group chat and refused to say she did not want to do theyre ideas to them. She would only tell me. I told her about ideas because i knew her taste. Outside covid we would have done calm thing activities: spa day with brunch or fancy tea but impossible. Also their ideas  could have got  me in big trouble at work as i work in an hospital.  I try to compromise. I offered to get the food and drink  and to chaffeur her and part of the friends and wait in the car . She refused . And she also refused to tell her friends that she did not want to do what they offered to do. I was the one that was the messenger. I told them: it is not her taste. the day is about her. let‚Äôs organise something she will enjoy. In the end: i was demeaned by friends in the group chat ( no swear words, more like uncompromising killjoy).  I organised, i gave food and beverages but did not stay. I have a temper. Sis knows it. I did not want risk a drunken outburst at them or further humiliarions to me. Sister was unhappy that i left. 

On her wedding days,  ( wich respected covid safety recommendations of the time, 30 or 50 people outdoors with some kind of permit if i remenber well). Her 3 friends ignored me and my sister prefered to be with them.  I spent time with the godmother of nibling and cousins. I Did a nice speech that she , husband and most guest appreciated . Her step kid insulted her, she has bad relation with them ) . To add info: it was 3 persons. 2 left the group chat wanting nothing to do with it and and those and one or 2 other friend prefered getting some alone quality time with her than be part of it. 


After that, i progressivly got low contact. It was not intentionnal at first. I was simply too exhausted to spend time with her and her entourage. The idea of seing them made me anxious so i cancelled and avoided. 

We tried to talk about it a couple of time. It is always a dead end. She says she acts respectfully and according to her priorities. It escalated over time: her husband is irate because he considers me a direspectfull brat. She claims i demandes her friends apologies to me . I do not give a fig  about them. I would have loved for to aknowledged that she asked for too much. 

One last thing, she told me in a calm and happy it tone, that the great aspect of me being childless is that when idie her kid will get all my money, the kid i have no relation too. 

When writing all that i feel justified in preserving myself from this but i would live to have neutral perspective. Some friends told me to try to mend things and to try and understand her view point . Other are ready to be there to see that my money go to charitiies

1hjw9qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepkids/comments/1hjw9qp/stepmom_has_destroyed_me/,Stepmom has destroyed me. ,"Am a 20F stepkid. Sorry for the long post in advance.

My mom died from ovarian cancer when I was 14 and at the time we were pretty spoiled because my dad mostly left my mom to parent us while he was working. Her death changed me to be a better person and to start looking out for my siblings more. 

Only a year after her death my dad dated and married my stepmother. We initially were very happy for him, but then his sister (my aunt) came in and started telling us all to start standing up for ourselves against him and tell him not to marry her. She had posed a lot of red flags. I was glad my aunt noticed, but she started to instigate a lot of fights between us kids and our dad. Our stepmother caught wind and blew up on us was well by bawling in front of us. We were 10-15 years old only at the time.

Around this time when my stepmother moved in she began to show her true colours. She chased two of our helpers out because they chipped her porcelain plates and she demanded my dad to make them pay back $10 even though they were working min wage. She is a hoarder. My dad also forced us to call her Mom even though we weren't close to her and it had only been less than  a year after her death. A big part of this was that he wanted to woo my stepmother and make her feel welcome. 


The helpers were supposed to assist my aging grandmother who couldn‚Äôt go up the stairs to clean. My stepmother made the promise to start looking after the house and help out my grandmother. None of that happened. Instead, I took on the job because I could see my grandmother tiring herself out helping to care for her son‚Äôs family. For context I was basically waking up early when my grandmother wasn‚Äôt around to prepare breakfast for my disabled elder sibling, do all the chores so my siblings could study in peace, and even took on cooking meals because my stepmother would never get dinner or lunch done on time. She was asleep in her room and would only come down at 4pm. I was studying for my diploma at the time and luckily my dad could provide financially so I didn‚Äôt have to work. I still was emotionally exhausted from having to care for my disabled elder sibling and look out for my two younger siblings emotional needs. Still I did my best to honour my parents and grandmother by cooking for them, and giving my grandmother my time and love and respect.

For some reason my stepmother who kept seeing me do the work she never did got insecure and started projecting onto me and my siblings. She would scream at scold me for doing the chores ‚Äúwrong‚Äù: eg I pushed the sofa out to clean, and she would scold me the way I pushed it as it would damage the sofa. The worst outburst I dealt with from her was earlier this year when I washed the floor mats she had bought before the entire family was due to leave for a family gathering. It was filthy and not washed for two weeks (again, she said she would get to it but never did) and when she came down she absolutely lost her crap. She accidentally dropped two plates and smashed them into the sink. I instructed my siblings to leave and went up to hide as my parents began to fight with the windows completely open. She barged into my room later, flung open all the windows and sat down on my chair began to cry about how we didn‚Äôt get along and why couldn‚Äôt we. I was terrified and was pretending to sleep. My sibling later told me she thought my stepmother had killed me because I was so silent on my bed. When I apologised to her later in the car to the gathering she told me ‚Äúmaybe you didn‚Äôt see my instructions‚Äù. Again, no apology for the show she put on in front of my younger siblings who were probably terrified.

My neighbours hear these fights because we have the windows open when my parents are down. And I‚Äôm not surprised they don‚Äôt like me either. Just today my neighbour walked past me and was giving gift bags out for Christmas. She didn‚Äôt approach me and averted her eyes. I found the gift bag hung onto the doorknob instead while I was in the house doing chores. I normally wouldnt suspect anything but what threw me off was that she could‚Äôve given it to me from the moment she saw me. She‚Äôs friends with my stepmother and witnessed me argue with my stepmom before. I suppose she was ignoring me, and I‚Äôd be lying if it didn‚Äôt hurt. 

The incident with the floor mats was the moment I put my foot down and gathered the courage to tell my dad off. I realised that he enabled much of my stepmom‚Äôs awful behaviour and attitude, not only to my grandmother and his children, but to himself. He doesn‚Äôt take it seriously when she talks to him disrespectfully and demands things like a child. And while he and my stepmother enjoy themselves and take long outings, I‚Äôm left to carry the household at home. Even on family trips, I have no break as I watch out and care for my elder disabled sibling. I realised that in many arguments, my dad always sided with my stepmom or just kept quiet while she attacked us. In many ways, it is his fault as much as hers. 

My dad and stepmom also shamed me very subtly in front of other relatives. It‚Äôs so subtle and the intention is masked by my mistake so it seems like they‚Äôre chiding me as their duty as parents. But many of the mistakes I made were due to outright forgetfulness because my brain is so focused on the stress, social anxiety, the mental anguish caused by them, the dull grief I carry after my mom‚Äôs death. 

I have AvPD and I‚Äôm struggling to maintain any form of friendships. My only close friend has controlling parents too and I can‚Äôt take her out often. I‚Äôm having anxiety attacks adjusting to my new group of friends and a new class in my university. There are times where I have no energy to talk to my friends and withdraw from them. I used to be more social and it becomes awkward when they see me quieter and screwing up socially. I also stopped talking about my issues after a friend I confided in basically said my stepmom had reasons for the way she acted - she had basically began to project her own relationship with her boyfriend onto my situation. She said that it was normal for stepmothers to dislike their MIL, and hinted on multiple occasions that I was overreacting to the way my stepmother treats me. Even though I understood her being well-meaning, I stopped confiding in her because it‚Äôs just not the same for many who grew up with toxic stepparents. It hurt to hear that from a friend.

A lot of my social anxiety stems from my guilt and shame of being quite controlling and lashing out when I was younger due to the whiplash of having to take on adult duties after my mother‚Äôs death while studying. I can‚Äôt talk to people properly and this worsens people‚Äôs view of me more. And when you've sacrificed as much as you can for your family, being micromanaged by someone you hardly know, laughed at and disrespected by the very parents you choose to love, and humiliating yourself in front of others (my mental health is deteriorating my social relationships). I feel discarded.

My dad now wants to rekindle the relationship between him and his children. Now he's a lot more mellow but he still has not been able to stand up for us. I have stopped talking to my stepmom and have distanced myself from him except for certain things likedoing his laundry, making him coffee i.e. the little ways I can still express my love. But the damage has been done. I dont foresee any kind of normal relationship between him and us. I've lost my mother, and now my father. I have undiagnosed OCD, social anxiety - I feel like I've failed as an older sibling. I want to be able to move my siblings out but with my mental health conditions it's sabotaging me. 

Maybe more than anything now, I‚Äôm looking for advice on anything really. I‚Äôm worried career wise I won‚Äôt be able to properly network and be seen as weird. I want to earn enough to help me and my siblings to leave but it's an impossible dream. My self esteem is low knowing I‚Äôve left a bad impression on so many people already trying to defend myself and my siblings. 

I‚Äôm heartened to see the love and support on this sub for each other. For the people dealing with toxic stepparents, please don‚Äôt give up. Much love and support to you all. It's not easy, take very day one step at a time. Take care of yourselves for your sake. ",2,1734864725.0,stepkids,0,1.0,False

1hjw6ii,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hjw6ii,How best to cut down and join table legs?,"We have a surplus ‚Äúdining‚Äù table in the barn, that we would like to cut down to a coffee table. As with a lot of old farmhouse tables, it‚Äôs too short to actually use as a dining table, but it is the perfect length and width for our sitting room as a coffee table. 

The legs aren‚Äôt removable. The turned part of the legs is currently 49.7cm tall, and the table is 72.5cm high. 

I would need to reduce the height by 23.5cm  to get to 49cm height, which seems to be about right for a coffee table.

The simplest option would be to simply cut 23.5cm from the bottom of the legs. But aesthetically, I think this is the worst option. 

So I would rather cut 20-23.5cm out of the leg somewhere and join the bottom back on, cutting some off the foot if necessary to get the height right. 

So my 2 questions are‚Ä¶

1. If this were your table and you were approaching this, what would you cut out to achieve the most balanced and appealing finish. I‚Äôm thinking cut the leg flush at the top, and then remove the top 23.5cm, which would be about half way down the tapered section.
2. Assuming I‚Äôm not just going to cut the required amount from the bottom of the legs, I‚Äôm going to have to join the bottom part of the leg to the top. What is the best way of doing this? Being a coffee table, you would have to assume feet being propped against it, so it will need to withstand racking. 

I have little experience working with furniture. I have a lot of hand tools, although having read most of the recent posts on shortening table/chair legs, I ordered a fine tooth pull saw. Amazon have lost the parcel though, so until I reorder, that won‚Äôt be an option.

He also takes Prozac. His mood seems better with the Enlyte but he also keeps saying he's very tired/sleepy all day at school and started drinking 2 cups of coffee a day just to get through the day. Now that we're on X-mas break, and I see that he's sleeping an insane amount. Slept 12 hours Frid night and then another 3 hours the next day. The doctor said she hasn't seen sleepiness as a side effect and I see that it's not listed as and major one for Enlyte. But I feel like he can't be the only one so I'm wondering if anyone else had had this experience. Thanks so much.",1,1734863610.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

**Essential App List -**  

1. MagicPin - It shows different events around the place you are and sometimes gives discounts on the food once you collect the coins when you use there app.
2. Zomato - Easy too use home delivery foods (now partnered with blinkit as well) dont use it regulary as they charge too much even if they say they are giving discount.
3. Swiggy - Just same like Zomato but in orange but also provide stationary and bigbasket like thing
4. Zepto - just a small copy of bigbasket but superfast
5. M indicator -  its a app that helps you track Mumbai locals so that you can always catch that train you missed

I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that quite a few content creators that are based in the US consistently use single use plastic cups and disposable tableware when they‚Äôre making and consuming food at home. Is there a reason for this? I grew up and still live in South East Asia/Australia and I‚Äôve never seen or used disposable tableware or cutlery at home unless it‚Äôs at a big family gathering. 

Is it just a habit? Or is it that buying single use items and discarding them saves money? Or a perception that it saves money? Obviously it boggles my mind from an environmental perspective, but what is the logic behind it for those who do use disposables at home? 

Always been curious!

1hjvxur,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1hjvxur/new_small_bike_for_crushing_hiking_commuting/,New small bike for crushing / hiking / commuting,"Omg.. Cruising of course. Sorry, lol. 

So... I'm not a motorcyclist, rather someone who enjoys the occasional ride. However, in the last weeks, since it's winter and I actually missed riding, I was super excited to go when temperatures were reasonable and had blast even on short ride. 
This might be a good hobby after all :)
I am now considering upgrading from my cb125r since motorway travel is a bit annoying at times.
What I expect from the new bike is:
- a more comfy seat
- a little more power (not a priority)
- relaxed riding position
- ideally better brakes
- more storage options than the tiny top case I have
- be reasonably light and small, I am 5'7 / 170cm
- hassle free

A good trip for me is going somewhere an hour or two away, go hiking / reading / drinking coffee for a couple of hours and going back - the dad adventure. And going to work, which is 20 min. I like the scenery rather than the speed. Very occasionally I go multi day to the Swiss alps. I'm a dork on a bike with a hiviz airbag vest :) 

I considered so far:
- a scooter like the vespa 300 gts for practicality.
- a royal enfield hunter 350 for the incredible coolness
- a bmw 310 gs because it's a bit dorky and will look good with a big case.

Any more ideas?

1hjvw8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hjvw8y/aitah_for_dating_my_friends_ex_boyfriend_after/,AITAH for dating my friends ex boyfriend after they broke up a little over a year ago?,"Recently I (23 F) started dating a guy (24 M) after reconnecting after high school, at a mutual friends party. He dated me best friend (we'll call her E) during our senior year in high school for a few months but they broke up when she started to get verbally and mentally abusive. I never took her side during their relationship even with girl code (I know what it's like to be abused during a relation ship and I didn't want him going through that). So after they broke up me and her got closer and I even took her to get her drivers license in my truck.



She wanted to treat me to sushi a few days later to say ""thank you."" She said that she would drive us to the restaurant as it's over an hour to drive to said location from where I live. So, I planned to drive to her house, which is about a half way point between my house and hers. As I got to her house, and i was about to grab my crap and hop out, she came running out and jumped in my truck. I asked her what she was doing and said that she couldn't drive us to the restaurant anymore. I said whatever because I had just got paid and had to go to Walmart anyways. So we started driving as she drops that we need to pick up her boyfriend before we keep going. I told her no and she got extremely mad at me. I told her he can drive himself or he's not going, which she finally stopped whining and stuck her head into her phone.



We made it to the restaurant and she got out and slammed my door which I told her not to do and she rolled her eyes. I normally don't take shit like this but I knew she was having problems at home so I let it slide. Turns out her boyfriend got dropped off by his mother before she went to work. We went in and sat down, and they both completely ignored me. They were rude to the waitress and I was beyond pissed at this point. What sealed the deal was when she asked if i could cover the bill for them, even though she was supposed to treat me for letting her take her driving test in my truck. I told her off and gave the waitress a $50 bill for the shit she had to go through with my friend and her boyfriend. She thanked me and I walked out, leaving both of them in the restaurant.



I stayed in my truck for about 15 more minutes before the two of them walked out holding hands and pissed looks on their faces. I was tempted to just lock the doors and leave but I wasn't going to leave them there as they both wouldn't be able to get a ride for a few more hours. Lone behold I drove both of them home, but they sat in the back seats together, making out, and probably doing more but I wasn't going to look and find out. I dropped the boyfriend off first at his place before heading back to her place. Mind you, we haven't spoken since we left the restaurant. So, we get to her house she gets out and I pull out.



A few days later she calls me crying that her new boyfriend broke up with her because he couldn't deal with her past. I get what she means tho, the past is the past but I also understood what he meant too. She has slept with 30 plus people, male and female, and personally I wouldn't want to date or be in a relationship with someone who as that many bodies. She also apologized for what happened the day we went to the restaurant, and I was reluctant to forgive her but I did. Soon we went out to eat like me normally did but sooner or later she stopped contacting me unless she ""needed"" something from me: going somewhere, seeing her ""new, new boyfriend"", to drop her off somewhere, etc. I get that she can't drive everywhere she wants too but she won't give me gas money, and expect me to drop everything I'm doing for her. She started smoking and drinking all the time and going to parties, while trying to get me to pick her up to go to them because her parents don't know that's what she's doing. She refuses to get a job as ""She's still young and doesn't want to hold herself down.""



Now its been about one month since she's last contacted me, and I've tried to text and call her to make sure she's okay, but I get left on read so I've also stopped contacting her. About two weeks ago i went to my friend (lets call her Cece.) I went to Cece's party for her sister who just graduated college. I was close to both of them so of course I was going to go. (Lets call the guy I'm dating H) H showed up about 2 hours after the party originally started as the party was going to last all night. I of course greeted him and we started catching up as we hadn't seen each other in months. We used to be close friends as he was in my class in high school, plus his dad works with my mom. Later in the night we both decide to leave, as he needed to get some things for his mom, while I left because I didn't want to be there with no one i really knew. At this point there were only 3 people I knew while the rest was Cece's family.



We drove off and about ten minutes after I got home, I get a text from H. We start talking and we try and plan something for us and some of our friends to do. Well, when me and him don't have any mutual friends besides Cece, we decided to just go to the beach together. One thing leads to another and he ends up telling me that he's liked me for a while but never asked me out so he wouldn't hurt the friend ship between me and E. Which then got me down the rabbit hole of everything that happened, and I let my true feeling out about the situation. I told him ""If she gets mad that I'm dating her ex from over a year ago, that seems like a her problem. And if she can't support my decisions then she's not a true friend. She never takes my advice so why the hell should I take hers."" Which he completely understood. I ended up telling him about how I've also liked him for a while so we went on a date the next day. He is the sweetest man I've ever met. He never lets me pay, gets me hanging plants as regular flowers die too fast, and can actually make me feel safe when I'm with him. Something I've never had in a previous relationship. After our date yesterday E texts me. Asking why she got a picture of me and H together at a coffee shop. She keeps texting me through out today, asking why we are together, and threatening random things that would honestly only hurt her, not me and H.



I left her on read as I don't have the heart to tell her that we are dating but at the same time, she treated me like shit, and if she can't be happy for me then I don't need the friendship. Me and H are finally going on that beach trip tomorrow, and he wants to take me out to a really fancy restaurant after. My parents love him already and he has a great job. We have a lot of the same ideals and morals and we get along amazingly. My mind is spinning while I'm asking myself if I am the AH or if what I'm doing is perfectly fine.
