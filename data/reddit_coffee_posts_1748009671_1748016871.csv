1ktnja5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ktnja5/i_crashed_out_over_my_ex/,I crashed out over my ex.,"Like the title says, I fully crashed out over my ex. He‚Äôs a classic avoidant and the break up was by no means a clean break. We continued seeing each other on and off for about a year after breaking up. We fell into this push and pull cycle of him opening the door for reconciliation and slamming it in my face when I asked for a real, adult, face to face conversation. We‚Äôve both blocked each other multiple times at this point. Back in December he admitted he thought about getting back together, too, but that we needed time and space. Admittedly I didn‚Äôt respect his request for space and tried to get him to talk to me about it face to face, and he blocked me and we didn‚Äôt speak for about five months.

Most recently, I sent him an email (I know, cringe) saying I wasn‚Äôt angry anymore, that I was sorry I couldn‚Äôt let go, and that I wished him the best. I wanted to do that for me, to fully accept it was over and move on. I wasn‚Äôt expecting a response but I got one. He told me he wished me the best too, hoped I was doing okay, and had some items he needed to give me. I asked him to pass it along to a mutual friend or leave it in his mailbox so we didn‚Äôt have to see each other. I knew seeing him would make me weak. But he insisted that we didn‚Äôt need to quarantine from each other and we met for coffee. It was nice, but tense. It felt like we were feeling each other out. He said he was seeing someone but that it was just a situationship and wasn‚Äôt serious and that he was going to end it. Of course this reignited some hope in me. 

About a week later I asked to see him again and he said no, that he didn‚Äôt want to have me over because he was seeing someone. More confusion on my end because he had said it wasn‚Äôt serious but I respected the fact that he felt it was inappropriate and didn‚Äôt push it. Some days later he texts me again that he did want to see me but he didn‚Äôt want to see me too often because it was too painful and too addictive, felt too much like dating again, and that he didn‚Äôt want to put ideas in my head or fuck with me. But ever since we broke up he has always put ideas in my head and I was dumb enough to take breadcrumbs for more than they were. He didn‚Äôt and still doesn‚Äôt know what he wants and I put up with this erratic and contradictory behavior for far too long. Always went back for more.

Again, I said that this is a conversation to be had and not over text. He asked when I was out of work and I said I would let him know when I was done. After work I asked if he‚Äôd like me to stop by or call him. I was met with a cold ‚Äúnah let‚Äôs not.‚Äù

I snapped. After literal years at this point of inconsistent behavior, confusion, manipulation, frustration with him and myself, I lost it. I called him a bunch of times. Left him voicemails that he couldn‚Äôt do this to me anymore and he owed it to me to face me. Called him a coward. Parked outside his house and told him I wasn‚Äôt leaving until he talked to me.

He eventually got back to me and said that my behavior proved that breaking no contact was a mistake and that he was blocking me again and to not contact him.

It was messy and I‚Äôm so, so embarrassed and ashamed. I had no right to do that. I practically threw a tantrum to get him to talk to me and treat me with respect. I feel I really crossed a line and find myself worrying what he must think of me now. But I shouldn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs been horrible to me. I shouldn‚Äôt care what he thinks. But I don‚Äôt want to just be thought of as a crazy ex. I was pushed to my breaking point.

I‚Äôve become a person I don‚Äôt recognize, begging someone to love me the way I love them. I feel like I‚Äôve been toyed with and that this is all just a game to him. I feel mindfucked. I‚Äôm so completely beyond hurt at this point. 

I know that I need to move on and move forward. The person I fell in love with is long gone and we‚Äôve both hurt each other too much at this point.

I‚Äôm not really looking for advice or anything. I truly just needed to get it off my chest. ",1,1748016821.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1ktnico,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ktnico/randomly_saw_my_ex_after_months_of_no_contact/,Randomly saw my ex after months of no contact.,"Last December, umuwi ako ng Pinas to beg for my ex na balikan ako and to try to win her back. God I loved her so much, na lahat ginawa ko para mag make up sa relationship namin but she didn‚Äôt want me anymore. May bago na rin siyang partner. Also, one of the reasons why we broke up eh dahil sa LDR setup namin. 

Just this evening, I was casually drinking my coffee at a convenience store nearby my place and to my surprise, bigla siyang dumating. When she entered the store, we had an eye to eye contact for just a second tapos bigla na siyang umiwas at dumiretso sa loob. Inatake ako ng panic attack and I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly. Parang sasabog yung dibdib ko when I saw her. I went outside para kumalma, tapos biglang lumakas yung ulan. As in buhos ng ulan. Para ‚Äòkong pinaglalaruan ng tadhana to be at the same place with her tapos lumakas pa yung ulan. Nagyosi ako sa labas habang nagpapatila, and she was just there sitting inside sa store. Nagpapatila rin. We were there siguro mga 20 mins or so. 

I didn‚Äôt have the courage to go to her para mangamusta or anything. She seemed surprise to see me back home dito sa Pinas kasi all she knew was that I am never coming back. Bumalik ako ng Pinas after years of being abroad kasi nakuha ko yung dream job ko in an international company based in Manila so I have to stay here for training.

I believe na we randomly saw each other again for a reason pero I didn‚Äôt do anything about it. Ni hindi ko man lang siya nakamusta. Ang bigat pa rin sa pakiramdam na makita siya. My own emotions took over that I didn‚Äôt even have the strength para man lang makausap siya. 

Hay. My life‚Äôs a circus.

1ktng36,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ktng36/i_30m_am_really_struggling_with_my_gf_29f_and/,I (30M) am really struggling with my GF (29F) and feel like I'm doing a lot but it's never enough,"Let me start by saying my GF is an absolutely incredible woman in so many ways and I love her very much.  She is incredibly intelligent, highly educated, very ambitious, has a ton of grit but she's also still very feminine, very attractive and we have a ton of chemistry most of the time (same sense of humor, same values for the most part etc..) She gets along great with my family, my friends and we are nearly a perfect match in so many ways.

There is one issue that is really eating away at me though.  I have this feeling that sometimes nothing is ""enough"" for her and she's ""on my case"" much more often than I would like.  I try to be the best boyfriend I can be and often times, I feel like I do more than most guys are probably doing, although this could be in my head.  I am essentially self employed in the real estate investment/brokerage world so I make an incredible income ($500-750k/yr) for my age and have access to very lucrative investment opportunities as well.  I view this as a golden opportunity to set us up for life and make sure we never have to worry about money when we have a family and give us a level of freedom most people can only dream of. However, that comes at a cost as I have to work a lot and sometimes things change quickly, I lose track of time, I get stressed about work and bring it home with me etc.. With that being said, I still dedicate a lot of time to our relationship and work around 50 hours per week.  Most evenings I set my phone down and try to be very present with her, I try to help her out around the house when she needs it, we take our dog on walks, I spend time/energy participating in hobbies/activities that she really wants to do, but I would probably never do on my own (gardening for example).  I also don't work on the weekend anymore so we can spend time together. Not complaining about this at all, just an observation. 

We just moved in together a few months ago and had this agreement that I would pay the majority of rent at our house and she would take care of most things around the house.  For the most part, this has been the case however she does often ask for my help on things, but it's usually small things that pale in comparison to what she's doing around the house.  She has incredibly high standards for basically everything and if something isn't done perfectly she gets really upset.  This has lead to a lot of fights and is our biggest issue.  Its tough because I genuinely feel like I'm trying, and I'm spending far more time on ""house"" related activities than I ever have in my life, but it still seems to fall short of her expectations more often than not.

Most recent example was this week.  We got a ton of her things out of storage and moved them all into our house and it's a LOT of stuff.  It's been a massive project getting the house setup, getting things organized in a meaningful way etc.. She works from home and I go into an office, so the past 2 weeks or so she has been working on the house a lot while I'm away at work. I come home and help out in the evenings (sometimes until 9-10pm) and will help out on the weekends, but she's def doing a lot more than me.  These are all her belongings and she wants the house to be setup a very specific way, so it can be difficult for me to help if she's not there because if I don't do it exactly the way she wants, it's counterproductive.

2 nights ago she told me she's been very overwhelmed with the house stuff and she feels a bit of resentment that I get to go to work and leave it all for an entire day while she's stuck with it.  She said she needs more help.  I told her I would work from home yesterday and wake up early to help before work, and then find times throughout the day to help.  I woke up at 5am with her, got some things done around the house and then started my work day.  I had 3 periods where I didn't have to do anything for 45min-1 hour and went up to her home office to ask what she wanted help with.  She was really busy with work and didn't have the time to think of anything really big I could do without her, so she gave me a handful of smaller tasks such as dishes, trash, etc.. I did all of them, however when I did the dishes I was on a work call and carelessly left a few lids in the sink.  I also left my morning coffee mug on the kitchen table.  I was on a work call so wasn't giving the dishes my full attention but got 90% of them done (along with everything else she asked me to do) and then walked away.

Couple of hours later, she got very upset with me about the dishes.  She said you told me you'd help me today, you barely helped at all and you couldn't even finish the dishes right because you were on a work call.  She told me she often feels like my job is my number 1 priority and she feels like she's in 2nd position.  I felt pretty hurt as I had woken up so early to get things done, I had agreed to work from home and I had done everything she asked me to do and had set time periods aside to help her and here I was getting yelled at for leaving a few lids in the sink and my coffee mug on the kitchen table.  I told her I came up to her office several times throughout the day to ask what she needed help with and it's not my fault she didn't have anything meaningful for me to work on.  She felt that I was doing the dishes when I was on a work call and didn't finish them to completion, and this made her feel like my job was more important than helping her around the house after I promised that the house would be a priority today.

We got in a big argument and I definitely pushed back.  To me this feels a bit crazy because I followed through on everything we talked about except the 3 lids in the sink and the coffee mug but her immediate reaction was to look at what I didn't do right instead of what I did do right.  To her, this felt like she really didn't give me a ton of stuff to do and the few things she did ask me to do, I couldn't do right because I was more focused on work.  She felt that I made a promise I would prioritize the house and then I was carelessly working on the small tasks she gave me while on a work call.  Something of this same nature has been a recurring theme in our relationship.  It will often surprise me as well,  I'll come home and do things with her for 3 hours and then she'll still get upset about something or make comments insinuating that she's just doing everything in this relationship. Some days things are incredible, other days I feel like I wake up at 5am, go to the gym, go to work all day, come home and help her with dinner, go on a walk with her and the dog, help out around the house until it's time for bed and then she still gets upset that I'm not doing enough and not making her a priority.  She told me the biggest thing that bothers her is when I say I will do something and then I either don't or do it in a half-ass way because my job  gets in the way.  However I feel if I'm honest with her and just straight up say ""I don't have time to help with that today because I have to work"" then she will also get upset.  I spend many multiples more time working on house related activities than I did when I was single and it still seems to fall short of her expectations often.

Just to reiterate I really do love this girl and want to marry her, but this feeling I have inside is hard to ignore.  This is our only real issue and everything else is nearly perfect.  This is not my first serious GF, but this is my first time living with a girl so I'm wondering if this is a normal thing when moving in with someone or if we're actually more incompatible than we thought (or I'm just being an asshole).  If we're looking at this relationship logically from a ""value-add"" standpoint, my biggest value-add is my income/investments and financial strength.  Her's is handling our personal lives and the house (cooking, cleaning, taking care of the dog, keeping our lives interesting with fun trips etc..).  I feel an immediate benefit from her ""value-add"" as I come home to a beautiful, clean home every day with a delicious meal cooking.  She feels an immediate benefit on the financial side to some extent because I pay for significantly more than she does, however I feel the benefit I am providing is more of a long term benefit, not something you feel right here right now.  I'm wondering if that's contributing to this.  Curious what the Reddit community thinks about this whole thing and what the best next steps are.

TL;DR - I feel like I'm spending way more time on ""house"" related chores/activities than I ever have before, but it seems to consistently fall short of my girlfriends expectations.   She often feels like she's 2nd priority behind my job, simultaneously I feel like I'm working less than I ever have to make sure I have time to help her and spend time with her.",1,1748016606.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt even know if I should post this here or just print it out and leave it on the counter next to the muffins and the sleeping cats. But if you're reading this... I need to ask:

Were you in it too?

There was a game.

Not on a screen. Not with controllers. Not something we could quit. It felt like a squad shooter at first, the kind me and the others play online‚Äîfoggy city streets, loadouts, commands, strange glowing marks on our armor like something ancient had claimed us.

But it wasn‚Äôt a game.

It was a nightmare that played us.

I remember the buildings were twisted versions of real places‚Äîyour coffee shop was there, but the sign was upside down and the windows bled fog. The corner store was barricaded like we were expecting war. And the sky was all wrong. No stars. Just layers of black cloud that felt like they were watching.

And the two of you‚Ä¶ you were there.

Not as yourselves. Not exactly. You wore cloaks‚Äîgreen ones, trimmed with silver thread that shimmered like spiderwebs in moonlight. You carried staffs, and when you slammed them into the ground, the monsters screamed. You burned the fog. You lit up the dark. I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it. You weren‚Äôt just in the dream. You were part of its defense.

And the others? They fought too. I remember Jason charging a wave of things that weren‚Äôt quite human. Cormac shouted something and became impossible to hurt. Rowan‚Äôs dog tore through the shadows like it had been waiting to be unleashed for years.

It was... coordinated. Too coordinated. Like we were supposed to be there.

And that‚Äôs what scares me the most.

Because everyone who died in that dream didn‚Äôt wake up.

Seven kids from our town. All in my grade. All players. All gone when the sun came up. One of them, Gwen, was my friend. She screamed when they pulled her into the fog. Her mic cut out. And when I tried to text her the next morning, her mom answered and said the police were there.

They said it was sudden illness. A gas leak. Some kind of mass hallucination. But I know what I saw.

And now I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real.

The worst part is, it‚Äôs still happening. I can feel it when I sleep‚Äîlike the dream's trying to pull me back in. Like it knows I‚Äôm writing this. Last night I heard footsteps in the hallway. No one was there. But the fog? It was outside my window. Thick. Still. Waiting.

So I guess this is me asking:

Do you remember?

Do you remember the fire you threw? The way you shielded us when we were about to break? Do you remember how you shouted, ‚ÄúI will not have you taint this reality,‚Äù and the fog caught flame like it had been soaked in gasoline?

Because I do.

And if that was just a dream, it wasn‚Äôt mine alone.

So please. If you read this‚Äîjust tell me I‚Äôm not crazy. Tell me you remember too. That you‚Äôre still here. Still you. Because if that dream ever comes back‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to go through it alone.

‚ÄîDavid




I found this tucked under a cooling mug beside the register this morning. There was no name on it. Just a faint coffee ring on the corner and handwriting that shook near the end.

Coffee, chocolate, and peanut butter seem to be the biggest triggers. The pain isn't excruciating, it's just sharp throbbing twinges. It also has a very ""nerve-like"" quality if that makes sense, like an almost tickly, itchy sensation that I can feel in my armpit and clavicle. Which makes me think maybe there's an irritated or slightly damaged nerve. 

Anyway. It's not debilitating but it is annoying. Has anyone had phantom pain in response to food triggers that eventually went away? Do you think it's safe to ignore it and eat trigger foods anyway?

I've gotten a total of 4 interviews, and only 1 went past the first round for a role I was overqualified for and would've been underpaid. I know the market is incredibly tough right now but the emotional toll each rejection or ghosting takes on me is so hard.

A friend connected me with an old colleague working in the department for a role I applied to, which I was very qualified for. Our chat was very nice and she told me she had passed on my name to the hiring manager and I should keep an eye out for a message from HR. This was a month ago and I never heard more. I just checked in with her yesterday to see if she'd heard of any movement, and she told me I should only expect to hear from HR if my application was a good match....despite what she had previously told me. I'm taking that as ""they're not interested in you"".

I truly don't know what else I can do. I tailor my resume and cover letter for every application. I've used all of my connections. I search for roles every. single. day. And to top it off, I cannot stand my current job. Truly, if I were to get fired and could get unemployment benefits it would be a sigh of relief.

I have sever sleep apnea. I've tried two machines and nothing. I decided to look into surgery options. My ENT green-lighted me for surgery because he said my tonsils are big. It's just that before I went in, the recovery made it seem unbearable. I came here and the posts confirm it: it's hell. 


But sleep apnea is no joke. I wake up super tired every morning. it's a battle. I have to take a large red-bull followed by a starbucks coffee only to come home from work and nap 2-3 hours. 


I also hear sleep apnea hurts your weight loss goals. If you workout and dont get good sleep, it's like throwing your workout out the window. 


anyway, should I go through the surgery?",1,1748016372.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False
1ktncn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ktncn8/how_to_address_feeling_distant_from_my_bsf_of_8/,How to address feeling distant from my bsf of 8 years,"i need some advice regarding how to approach and open a conversation with my bsf, who i have grown distant with the past year. 

for some context, my bsf friend and i (both 20f) have been friends for eight years now, and we go to the same uni abroad. we were incredibly close and the rare times we do talk, it‚Äôs like nothing has changed at all but these hangouts are fewer and further between. we have very similar life experiences such as growing up in an international context and moving a lot and such, but this past year or so, i feel like i‚Äôve barely seen her and although i still call her my best friend when introducing her or talking about her, internally, i feel odd using the title because we don‚Äôt really talk enough to truly know each other on that level anymore. 

she went on a semester abroad last year and came back with a many new friends, which i was so happy for her about, but now she has such a wide new circle of friends that i don‚Äôt know nor spend time with and as a result, her and i don‚Äôt really hang out as often anymore. 
we‚Äôve always been different, especially as she is a huge extrovert and i‚Äôm quite introverted and not as involved in the party scene of our uni, unlike her and her new friends. 

i want to send her a message (we‚Äôre currently home in diff countries) about the situation. i‚Äôve barely seen her this past school year, and i know she‚Äôs been overwhelmed with school but she still is always spending time with others and when school died down, her efforts to see me didn‚Äôt increase or anything. i know i‚Äôm partly to blame, i didn‚Äôt push to see her either after a few rejections because she was already busy, and maybe i gave up too fast which contributed to the distance.

i‚Äôve come to realise that we were barely best friends anymore when i went through some rough times these past months, and it‚Äôs not even that she wasn‚Äôt there for me (i didn‚Äôt give her the info nor opportunity to be), it‚Äôs that i didn‚Äôt even consider her as someone to contact for support anymore. if we couldn‚Äôt even reach out to each other for a basic coffee chat or quick catch up, how could i feel comfortable reaching out when i‚Äôm feeling low and vulnerable, especially with the high likelihood that she would be busy anyways and not available‚Ä¶

i‚Äôm probably not making much sense, all this to say that i don‚Äôt know how to word this to her. i want to ask if she‚Äôs noticed this distance (she definitely has, but tends to ostrich and ignore issues until they go away).  i want to ask if there‚Äôs anything i can do to help, if it‚Äôs just us naturally growing up and apart or if it‚Äôs just us not reaching out for whatever reason, because one of those is life and the other has a simple solution. i want her to know that it does pain me, it makes me feel like i value her more than she does me, that i hold our friendship to a higher esteem than she does, especially because feeling less appreciated isn‚Äôt a new issue, that part i‚Äôve been feeling for years (according to old diaries i found, which incited my need to reach out). 

anyways, i‚Äôm rambling and i have no clue if i got my sentiment or point across, im looking for advice or tips on how to broach such a topic, it would most likely be by text,  maybe wording or points to make and prioritise and such",0,1748016364.0,Advice,0,0.5,False
1ktnc7u,https://lu.ma/41c7eb24,"virtual book club: holy shit, rick rubin just rewrote the tao te ching for vibe coders","I'm so blown away by this collab betwen Rick x Anthropic (led by rick I might add, according to the creds on the project website, read it here: thewayofcode.com) 

Rick re-imagines the tao te ching by lao tzu... but for vibe coding and the new era of code we're entering.

I found myself so inspired by this that I'm hosting a virtual book club meetup on Sunday to discuss it with other people who thought this was cool. Here's the run of show, please join me if you're interested

# The rough plan:

* ‚ÄãOn Sunday, one Google Meet link
* ‚ÄãLoose structure, open discussion
* ‚ÄãRaise your hand, share what hits you
* ‚Äã2 hours to explore this thing together

# ‚ÄãWhat we'll probably talk about:

* ‚ÄãFavorite passages from The Way of Code
* ‚ÄãRick Rubin as the patron saint of taste > technical skill
* ‚ÄãHow vibe coding is changing everything (something like 25% of YC's latest batch is AI-generated)
* ‚ÄãWhere this is all heading

# ‚ÄãWho should come:

‚ÄãAnyone who...

* ‚ÄãThinks we're in a new age of enlightenment with AI
* ‚ÄãWants to be part of this cultural moment
* ‚ÄãHas been building with Claude/Cursor/v0/Lovable/etc
* ‚ÄãJust curious what the hell this is all about

# ‚ÄãThe dream:

‚ÄãSomeone from Anthropic sees this and signal boosts it. Rick Rubin himself drops in. But honestly? Let's just see what happens when we get a bunch of people who feel this shift in the same room.

‚Äã**Sunday morning. Coffee in hand. Talking about the future.**

‚ÄãFree. Show up and let's jam.

Overview:
- Very expressive of her emotions and struggles to SSK and not to anyone else even to her best friend: Littara, and her lil sister: Suomi.

- The type that likes to trauma dump the ones she trusts wholly

- The Crying and Sobbing type when Drunk

- Extremely Affectionate, and the type that dresses loosely depending whom she is interacting with especially to SKK.

- Frequents SKK‚Äôs Room, and likes to ‚ÄúDe-Stress‚Äù there often, though she gets annoyed if SSK‚Äôs not there watching her ;)


Achievements in the Doll Harem War:

- SSK made coffee for Ullrid

- SSK calls Ullrid his ‚ÄúFalcon‚Äù and Irreplaceable Partner

- Ullrid gets to sleep in SSK‚Äôs room a bit too often

- Nursing SSK back to health; after she and SSK destroyed the second Doll Hunting Grounds and assisted in killing the Man with the Bow (Jerome) that once tried to hunt down Ullrid.

- Gifting SSK one of her precious stress toys, a Pig Shaped Stress Ball.

- Ideological Debate between Klukai‚Äôs Dictatorship Leadership Style Vs. Ullrid‚Äôs Democratic Leadership Style

Rating:
10/10; 

- SSK‚Äôs Rizz is unmatched, somehow expressed more Rizz than in Makiatto‚Äôs Affinity Stories

Warning: 
- Do NOT let Ullrid befriend Mechty, or else she‚Äôll contract the Sleepo Beepo Lazy Disease just like Vector.

2 - Downtown looks like it gave up in 1998 and no one told it to try again.


3 - The only thing more dead than the nightlife is the ambition.


4 - Lincoln was not born there, did not die there, just lived there for a while, just like any average American who moves around.


5 - It is so boring, even boredom packed up and left.


6 - You can feel your dreams dying a little more every time you drive down Dirksen Parkway.


7 - Locals will argue it is a ‚Äúnice place to raise a family,‚Äù which is code for ‚Äúthere is absolutely nothing to do here.‚Äù


8 - The job market is so dry it makes the Sahara look humid.


9 - Everything closes early because hope clocked out years ago.


10 - ‚ÄúHistoric charm‚Äù is just an excuse for crumbling buildings and outdated infrastructure.


11 - It is not a city. It is a big neighborhood that got too confident.


12 - Every local thinks it is better than it actually is.


13 - The roads are a post-apocalyptic obstacle course made entirely of potholes.


14 - There are more vape shops than job opportunities.


15 - If you are under 30 and not already trying to leave, you have clearly given up.


16 - The mall is a good place for homeless people to sleep.


17 - You will find more creativity in a frozen dinner aisle than in Springfield‚Äôs so-called art scene.


18 - The coffee game sucks. They praise Custom Cup like it is special, but it is just a mediocre place with ridiculous prices.


19 - You are either surrounded by cornfields or government workers.


20 - Half the fun things you hear about are actually in a completely different city, usually Champaign or Peoria.


21 - You either work in state government, healthcare, or wish you did.




I appreciated Springfield's horribleness even more after I left.

So I (29F) was set up by a mutual friend with this guy (31M). The date actually started out really well, we had a lot in common, great conversation, and honestly I was feeling pretty good about it. We ordered some coffee and pastries, nothing crazy, the bill was about $100. When the bill came, I was ready to split it, but then he handed me the bill and said, ""Is it alright if you pay for this?"" No explanation, no offer to get the next one, nothing,  just that.

I was a little caught off guard, but it wasn‚Äôt that expensive, so I said sure and paid. Right after I paid, he got this huge grin on his face and said, ""Congratulations, you passed the test! You're not a gold digger."". Apparently, his ex used to expect him to pay for everything, dates, trips, etc., and he got fed up with it. So now he ""tests"" women to see if they're after his money or not.

Honestly, I was so annoyed. I told him that I'm not his ex and he has no right to treat me like I'm guilty until proven innocent. I also said he‚Äôs not some prize that I need to pass tests for. Then I got up and left.

Afterward, I texted our mutual friend to let him know what happened. He apologized and said he'd talk to the guy. I told him I‚Äôm blocking him and I don‚Äôt want anything to do with him anymore.

The thing is, it's not even about the money. I have a good career, I own property, I'm very financially independent. I absolutely don‚Äôt want to be anyone‚Äôs ATM either. But I would never pull a stunt like that to ""test"" someone‚Äôs character. The way he said ""Congratulations"" like I‚Äôd won something seriously rubbed me the wrong way. It just felt so gross and weird.

But now I‚Äôm wondering... was I too harsh? Should I have just let it go and chalked it up to him being burned before? AITAH?

UPDATE:

It‚Äôs been three weeks and he‚Äôs still trying to get in touch with me. I‚Äôve blocked him on everything, as in EVERYTHING, but he keeps popping up through new accounts, or messaging apps I forgot I even had. He even tried connecting with me on LinkedIn (which feels so unhinged for this situation, honestly).

At first, it was stuff like ‚ÄúI just want to explain.‚Äù, then ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not like other girls, I know that.‚Äù. Then it turned into full paragraphs about how I‚Äôm ‚Äúpunishing‚Äù him for protecting himself and how he‚Äôs the one who feels betrayed. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where just seeing a notification with his name gives me this weird, anxious feeling. I‚Äôve kept ignoring him, I haven‚Äôt replied once,  but it‚Äôs exhausting. I messaged our mutual friend again and said, please make sure he stops. Friend apologized (again) and said he didn‚Äôt realize the guy would act like this.

I‚Äôve been trying to brush it off, but the more time passes, the more I realize how messed up it was. He didn‚Äôt go on a date to get to know me, he went to judge me, compare me to his ex, and see if I ‚Äúmeasured up.‚Äù And now he‚Äôs acting like I owe him a second chance because I ‚Äúpassed.‚Äù üôÉüôÉ

Anyway. I guess I‚Äôm just posting to vent now. Thank you so much. üôè

I recently returned to work after maternity leave. I go into the office 3 days per week and work from home 2. On my WFH days, a nanny comes to our house. My 2 year old will not let the nanny do anything for him. He just wants Mommy all day. If I close the office door and tell him I need to work, he stands outside and screams and cries.

Does anyone have any advice for managing toddler separation anxiety/wanting mommy all the time and getting him to spend time with the nanny??? It is SO difficult for everyone involved. I feel terrible for the nanny. I can‚Äôt get any work done. Obviously I don‚Äôt want my kid to be sad and cry all day.

Before baby, he spent time with the nanny fine while I worked from home. This is new since my maternity leave. I think he got very accustomed to having me available all the time and is struggling with the transition. He does ok on days I‚Äôm at work out of the house.

Adding - please do not suggest that I go work at a coffee shop or that I hide all day in the office. I am pumping every 2-3 hours for baby, so it isn‚Äôt feasible for me to go sit at Starbucks.

This is a tweaked version of the very first cola recipe I made, a dark cola, with some cutdowns made, and it's both smoky and smooth as FUCK. it's also peak chuuni cola, which was part of the original design brief \[and my general cola ethos outside of the simple one\], in which I named its first iteration the Darkest Abyss based on the game that inspired it. Now the recipe (void cola? is that anything), with two variants:

Recipe A (it's an adventure, slightly more flavour)  
Recipe B (simple)

**Cola syrup**

*Yields \~1L of syrup, good for \~25 glasses of cola (if you don't want that much you can just like halve the recipe or something)*

**""Caramel"" mix**

* 100ml water
* 300g dark brown sugar

**Main syrup mix**

* 900ml water
* 4 tsp black peppercorns
* 8 tsp coriander seeds
* 4 tsp cloves
* 10 star anise
* 2 tbsp cardamom pods
* 4 cinnamon sticks
* 6 slices of 1cm fresh ginger
* 600g (3 cups) dark brown sugar
* 300g (1.5 cups) white sugar
* 1 lemon
* 1 lime

**Additional items**

* 2 tbsp vanilla extract
* 2 tsp instant coffee
* 4 tsp Sichuan peppercorns (optional)
* 4 tsp ground nutmeg

**Recipe A (Full):**

1. Pare the skin off the lemon and lime with a peeler, slice the ginger, and place it all into a ""fresh stuff"" bowl.
2. Cut the lemon and lime open, and juice them both into a bowl. 
3. With a pestle and mortar, lightly crush all the peppercorns, cloves and coriander seeds to allow them to release more of their essence. Break the cinnamon into pieces and put it all into a dry spices bowl with the cardamom and star anise.
4. In one pot, boil down the ""caramel"" mix until it starts darkening and slightly caramelising. Take off heat before it burns.
5. Meanwhile, in another pot, boil everything from the ""fresh stuff"" and ""dry spices"" bowls to allow everything to infuse. Once your caramel mix is ready (and also slightly cooled down so it doesn't bubble at you when you mix them), put in the main syrup mix.
6. Put in the additional items and lime/lemon juices, and simmer your syrup (don't boil it too much) until you have around 1 litre of syrup in the pot, or it's at around 2/3 of its original volume. Add black food colouring/gel if desired.
7. Let cool for around half an hour or so to ensure it doesn't shatter the glass you put it in; filter with a cheesecloth or fine sieve and refrigerate; this keeps for about a week.

  
**Recipe B (Simple):**

1. fuck that noise. put everything into one big pot, mix it up and boil it down til there's like 1 litre of syrup in that thing
2. Let cool for around half an hour or so to ensure it doesn't shatter the glass you put it in; filter with a cheesecloth or fine sieve into a glass container and refrigerate; this keeps for about a week.

To make a glass it's the same as the simple cola; glass 15-20% full of syrup, fill the rest with carbonated water the rest of the way!

Also very optional but you can froth up some egg whites and put it on top a la the Ramos Gin Fizz to provide some contrast and feel fancy if you want, but that's your food safety call. Use carton pasteurised egg whites if you really aren't sure

- the noise comes after pouring any cup sizes
- I have a water filter installed in the tank: same noise with or without it installed

Tokyo moves fast.

Beneath the cherry blossoms, beneath the neon-glow vending machines, there was always a buzz.

Maybe except around one man.

_____________

In 2018, a man called Shoji Morimoto was criticized at his workplace. His superior told that he lacked proactiveness and intent to initiate. He was fired from his job since he boss considered that he was ‚Äúnot doing anything‚Äù of value for the company.

This is where the fun starts, he decided to earn his livelihood by ‚Äúnot doing anything‚Äù.

‚ÄúOkay, but how?‚Äù is the natural question anybody would ask.
_____________

While initially this was a strange idea, his business picked up and he was soon flooded with requests, As of today, he makes a whopping $80000 a year from ‚Äòdoing nothing‚Äô.

He doesn‚Äôt pretend to be your friend. He doesn‚Äôt fake enthusiasm. He just shows up. And sometimes, that‚Äôs exactly what people need.

His typical conversation probably looks something like this:

‚ÄúAre you really just going to sit there?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
‚ÄúNot going to judge me?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
‚ÄúNot even if I eat all of this sushi alone?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm just here.‚Äù

In a city of excess, he sold emptiness.

According to Morimoto, he receives about 1,000 requests per year. He charges a flat rate of between 10,000 yen and 30,000 yen ($65 to $195) for a 2 to 3 hour session, and earned around $80,000 last year.

Why the business works (Especially in Japan)

Japanese society often values restraint and quiet dignity. Morimoto fits perfectly: he offers company without intrusion.

For anyone who‚Äôs uncomfortable eating alone or people who feel socially anxious, he‚Äôs a neutral, calming presence.

Many feel tired of being ‚Äúon‚Äù all the time. Morimoto allows people to drop the mask ‚Äî for a fee.
Also a lot of his clients‚Äô requests are strange and include:

1.Reminding a woman to send a message reminding them to cut her nails before having coitus with her husband.

2. Sit beside someone who‚Äôs writing their thesis.
Join a woman who didn‚Äôt want to visit a divorce lawyer alone.

3. Walk silently with someone who missed their deceased dog.

4. Eat dinner with a client at a Michelin-starred restaurant ‚Äî without speaking.

5. Morimoto insists that he doesn‚Äôt give any life advice to his clients. He was just a passive listener who helps out people.

He made a living out of doing nothing ‚Äî while dining at the best restaurants in Tokyo, with strangers who left a little lighter than they came.

While it started as a meme-worthy idea, Morimoto has since inspired books, documentaries, and now global interest. He has directly challenged notion that value must come from doing. Sometimes, value lies in simply being.

Morimoto has also authored a quirky memoir titled ‚ÄúRental Person Who Does Nothing‚Äù. His memoir is very philosophical, looking at why people are renting his services. A simple example would be a cafe owner, who does not want empty seats when it opens. This is where Morimoto comes to have a coffee at opening time, then sees more people coming in.

Morimoto has convincingly made people believe that he is a lazy, ‚Äòdo-nothing‚Äô person, while in reality he‚Äôs a genius. He‚Äôs also kind, never belittling his clients‚Äô requests and generous too. It‚Äôs worth reading about Morimoto‚Äôs business, his rules for accepting or rejecting jobs and why it is successful.",1,1748015010.0,Medium,0,1.0,False

Stripped down from six engines to a razor-sharp four, the Moth isn‚Äôt just lighter ‚Äî it's smarter, faster, and dangerously efficient. Its core systems are built from the sharpest salvage ever pulled from our glorious junk pits, refined through late-night welding and coffee-fueled heresy.   
  
This is the first Bugforge craft to pass all real-condition field tests. No explosions. No spinouts. Just clean exits, perfect burns, and a cockpit so smooth it almost feels illegal. Our junkers‚Äîsorry, our engineers‚Äîgave everything they had. Blood. Sweat. Probably a lung.   
  
And it paid off. The Quantum Moth is not a step forward. It's a rupture. A leap. A taunt hurled at the laws of physics and the face of every polished manufacturer in orbit.   
  
Welcome to the turning point.   
Welcome to the Quantum Moth.

I'm having a problem with two of my partner Rob's friends. They are a couple, Seth and Amy, early 30s. (fake names)

Rob and I had a huge fight while on vacation recently. We have since started couples therapy and are doing fantastic. The problem I'm having is with Seth.

Rob considers Seth one of his closest friends. I like them but I am not close with them. We see them out at bars only, they never speak (calling or texting). Seth has never invited Rob to spend time with him, we don't do couple hangs, we literally only see them randomly when we're out. They don't share life experiences like friends do, hang out, chat, share meals, get coffee, grab drinks, honestly nothing. To be fair, I've never seen Rob put any effort into this ""friendship"" either.

Before this fight we had, I invited Seth and Amy to my bday party (it's a big event, I sent free tickets to everyone I invited, including them). I really only did it as a favor to Rob. I think they're cool, but they're not MY friends.

So after Rob and I get back from vacation right after this fight, Rob gets drinks with Seth, as you do with friends, for perspective, support, etc. This is the first time Rob made actual plans with him since we‚Äôve been dating (\~1 year).  Rob comes back the next day and vaguely says they discussed said fight. I have no idea exactly what Rob told Seth, I didn't feel like it was my place to ask at the time. It was a terrible and scary fight and it took us weeks to reconcile and understand each other. I assumed that Rob only told Seth his side of it. Later Rob told me that Seth said something wildly offensive about how I treated Robt, which felt completely untrue. But I felt telling Rob that I thought this was inaccurate was wrong. He is entitled to his experience and we both had an awful one.

So the main issue. When we see Seth and Amy now, Seth is weird to me, standoffish, awkward, gives me weird looks, or ignores me. Honestly, I am fine with this, I still treat him kindly and make conversation. The problem I'm having now is what to do about my bday party. I do not want someone who thinks such awful things about me to be there. I want to uninvite Seth but feel super uncomfortable about it. I don‚Äôt like penalizing Amy for something Seth did, but uninviting just him would be weird. I feel like my only option is to uninvite them both and explaining why, not only to them but to Rob, which sounds terrible.

WIBTA if I uninvite them because what Seth said about me was fucked up and wrong? Doing so also makes me feel like I'm invalidating Rob‚Äôs understanding and feelings about what happened. I just don't know. Should I just let them come and not even think about it? I don't want this guy to think he can just say bullshit about me and it's fine. And I kind of want the tickets that I paid for back if that's what he thinks.

TL;DR: I want to uninvite my partner‚Äôs ‚Äúclose‚Äù friend from my birthday party because of what he said about me after a fight my partner and I had.

EDIT: sorry reddit, I fixed the name issue, was just trying to cut down on characters and that one got missed. Also, when we see this couple out, it usually with a big group of their friends. So I'm not really talking to Seth, just around him.

  
EDIT 2: this was super helpful. I'm going to leave the invite standing, maybe they don't come, and just tell Rob how I'm feeling. Thinking through things again, I hardly see Seth so oh well.",4,1748014571.0,AmItheAsshole,23,0.7,False

The family members aren't so much of a concern- we'd do almost anything for the ones that are traveling alone, and the others come with a group (kids, spouses, etc.) and so end up renting cars (we're 1 1/2+ hours from the nearest int'l airport).   The friends have been a trickier.

For context- we're retired fairly early, we have lots of friends here already so also a busy social schedule, and we take various classes (language, crafts, sports, yoga) each week for which we have to pay at the beginning of the month, with one weekday being totally open.  We have a guest house so cohabitating in the main house is not an issue.

Our round trip to the airport ends up costing 35‚Ç¨ in tolls.  Fine for Mom, but once all the friends start expecting pick ups and drop offs it gets expensive.  There is a train that takes an equal amount of time to get here for 12‚Ç¨, but I literally had one friend b\*\*\*h me out and call me a bad friend for 30 minutes when I asked her to take it.  (Now I'm dreading her visit.)  On top of all that, a week of missed classes ends up costing over 150‚Ç¨.  I hate to sound cheap, but we're entering the high season here and already we're feeling like it ends up being expensive and disruptive. We had one friend all last week and another coming next week, and things are just ramping up.

I love my friends and the fact that they want to come see us.  While they're here we try to make things as lovely, homey and comfortable for them as we can- stocking nice bath products, having food and coffee in the guest house for them, etc.  I just don't want to end up feeling annoyed at them or taken advantage of.

I wonder how all of you maintain your daily life/sanity/love for your friends while hosting them?

The Orioles have been, for lack of a better term, absolutely tragic. They‚Äôve lost 8 of their last 10 games, and with Cade Povich on the mound today, backing Boston to do most of the damage at home seems like reasonable fade. While the Red Sox offense isn‚Äôt my favourite as of late, the Orioles‚Äô opponents have put up at least 5 runs against them in their last 5 straight outings. To boot, Cade Povich's last 3 straight encounters with Boston have seen the Red Sox score at least 5; I expect them to do the same today. I‚Äôll take the Team Total Over to cash.

I was poking around online and stumbled on a story about Hampshire teaming up with Amherst locals for a massive community mural project downtown, and it‚Äôs got me reminiscing about the quirky, collaborative spirit of my Hampshire days. Anyone else following this?

Apparently, in early May 2025, Hampshire‚Äôs Art and Community Engagement program partnered with the Amherst Area Chamber of Commerce to transform a blank wall on North Pleasant Street (near the old A.J. Hastings spot) into a vibrant mural celebrating the town‚Äôs history and diversity. The project brought together Hampshire students, local high schoolers, and even some longtime Amherst residents to design and paint it. The mural features everything from tributes to the town‚Äôs farming roots to nods to the Five Colleges‚Äô progressive legacy‚Äîdefinitely a Hampshire touch! It was unveiled last week, and the local paper said it‚Äôs already a selfie hotspot.

As someone who spent countless hours in the ‚Äô80s debating art and activism in the Hampshire barns, this feels like the kind of project that captures what made the college special‚Äîblurring the lines between campus and community. Back then, we‚Äôd organize impromptu art happenings in the woods, so seeing Hampshire students lead something this public and inclusive warms my heart. I‚Äôm half-tempted to drive up from my neck of the woods to check it out in person.

Anyone seen the mural yet? What‚Äôs the vibe? And for current students, are you involved in similar projects? Also, random throwback: is the coffee at Rao‚Äôs still the best in town, or am I stuck in the ‚Äô80s? üòÑ

# So What¬†Is¬†Tonka Bean?

Tonka bean comes from the seeds of the Dipteryx odorata tree in South America. Sounds botanical and niche-y, right? But once it‚Äôs dried and cured, it gives off an aroma that‚Äôs basically¬†*cozy magic*. Perfumers love it. I love it. You probably already love it without even realizing it.

# What Does It Smell Like?

Think of tonka bean as vanilla‚Äôs cooler, more mysterious cousin. Its scent is:

* **Vanilla-like**¬†(but not basic vanilla)
* **Nutty**¬†(almond vibes!)
* **Warm & spicy**¬†(like a whisper of cinnamon and clove)
* **Smooth & long-lasting**¬†(this stuff¬†*lingers*)

It‚Äôs the note that takes a perfume from ""nice"" to ""I can‚Äôt stop smelling my wrist.



# Why Perfumers Swear By It

Tonka bean is a shapeshifter. It plays well with others and works across fragrance families‚Äîgourmand, woody, floral, spicy, you name it. Plus, it helps glue everything together and stretch the life of your scent.

It also has unisex appeal. Sweet enough for lovers of cozy scents, warm and spicy enough to add edge.

# Where to Sniff It: 5 Killer Tonka Bean Perfumes

If you want to meet this note in its natural (and luxurious) habitat, try these:

**1. Gucci Guilty Absolute**¬†‚Äì Earthy leather meets tonka‚Äôs creamy darkness. Bold, raw, intense.

**2. Versace Eros**¬†‚Äì Mint and citrus up top, sweet spicy heart, and that signature tonka smoothness. Seduction mode: activated.

**3. Dior Hypnotic Poison**¬†‚Äì Iconic. Sultry. Tonka brings the almond-vanilla base to life. It‚Äôs a warm embrace in perfume form.

**4. Calvin Klein Euphoria**¬†‚Äì Floral but grounded. Tonka here adds warmth and sweetness without getting sugary.

**5. YSL Black Opium**¬†‚Äì Coffee + tonka = heaven. It‚Äôs sweet, spicy, creamy, and endlessly addictive.



# Pro Tip: How to Pick Your Tonka Bae

* **Like vanilla?**¬†Go sweet and creamy.
* **Like spice?**¬†Look for ones paired with clove, cinnamon, woods, or amber.
* **Like it bold?**¬†Choose darker blends like leather or oud-infused tonka.

I am 24(F), 165cm (5‚Äô4) and 72.8 kg when i started falling down to 69.8kg. Just for a bit of background I had a pretty bad concussion end of last year which left me with muscle problems at the back of my head (one muscle it‚Äôs constantly inflamed and gets bigger and smaller) and this was my main motivation for starting carnivore. My second was my weight.
I started 12 days ago and I saw extremely good results. My bloating was gone, i started to feel better (concussion symptoms) my head felt clearer. I would eat a lot of fatty pork, eggs, beef, salmon(twice) and sardines. I also had a bit of milk in coffee and salt in water.
Now starting 4 days ago I started having explosive diarrhea like water. And 2 days ago i started having palpitations. I tried adding more salt but the palpitations become more frequent. 
Now i know that we need electrolytes and because i am quite small and I don‚Äôt have a big appetite i would undereat quite a lot. I listen to ‚Äòeat until you are full‚Äô, and looking back i would consume less than 1g of potassium a day. I ordered some supplements but i think it got late for me and i had to go to hospital because of my palpitations. My pulse also would feel quite weak, my mouth got very dry and i felt exhausted constantly.

I REALLY want to make this diet work. I am DESPERATE to make it work (because of my concussion) but i just don‚Äôt know how. I am not big on supplements especially since i researched how potassium can be quite damaging if taken as a capsule.

Please if someone had dealt with this or if anyone has some advice or research you can send through i would really appreciate it. I want to make it work i just don‚Äôt know how this would work for me without supplements and potassium supplements would be a big no for me. Thank you!

1ktm5g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuttingEdgeEdits/comments/1ktm5g7/is_there_a_windows_equivalent_to_apples_imovie/,Is there a Windows equivalent to Apple's iMovie?,"So this came up in a convo the other day with a friend who recently switched from Mac to PC. First question outta their mouth? ‚ÄúHow to download iMovie on Windows?‚Äù And I get it ‚Äì iMovie is clean, intuitive, and doesn‚Äôt scare people off with too many knobs and dials. But here‚Äôs the thing: **you can‚Äôt download iMovie on Windows**, period. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre on Windows 10, 11, or running a time machine from 2009. Apple keeps iMovie firmly locked into their ecosystem, and yeah, it‚Äôs kinda a bummer.

Now, before we throw our hands up and start hunting for a dusty old MacBook just to edit videos of our dog doing backflips, let‚Äôs talk about what you *can* use on Windows that feels close to iMovie ‚Äì or dare I say it, even better in some cases.

I‚Äôve been working in video editing for a bit (more than a hobbyist, less than Spielberg), and over time I‚Äôve tested a bunch of tools ‚Äì some great, some garbage. If you're trying to find an iMovie vibe on Windows, here are a few options I‚Äôd consider based on your skill level and what kind of content you're working on.

# For the ‚ÄúI just want to cut clips and slap on music‚Äù folks:

**1. Clipchamp**Clipchamp is now baked into Windows 11, and it‚Äôs surprisingly decent for quick edits. Think of it like ‚ÄúiMovie Lite.‚Äù The interface is simple, drag-and-drop style, and it has templates for stuff like YouTube intros or social reels. Not a ton of effects, but if your needs are basic, it‚Äôll get the job done without cooking your CPU.

Only downside? It‚Äôs browser-based for some features and nags you with ‚Äúpremium‚Äù upgrades every so often. But for short-form stuff or beginner content, it‚Äôs a solid iMovie-ish experience.

**2. OpenShot**Open-source and free. Looks a bit clunky at first glance, but it‚Äôs capable. Think of it like a slightly janky cousin of iMovie ‚Äì less polish, but gets the job done. I ran into a few performance hiccups when tossing in heavier 4K files, and rendering can be slow, but if you‚Äôve got patience (and maybe a cup of coffee), it‚Äôll work.

# For the ‚ÄúI want iMovie, but I also want to get a little fancy‚Äù crowd:

**3. Shotcut**Shotcut sits in this weird in-between space ‚Äì it has a deceptively simple interface, but there‚Äôs a ton of depth once you start poking around. You can layer videos, tweak audio, mess with filters, and it won‚Äôt make you sign up or pay a cent. It‚Äôs not quite drag-and-drop-easy like iMovie, but if you‚Äôre ready to level up slightly, this is a good one to try.

Bonus: no watermarks, even in the free version. That‚Äôs rarer than you‚Äôd think.

**4. Movavi Video Editor**Now, I stumbled onto Movavi a couple years back while working on some short-form travel edits. It‚Äôs not as hyped as the others, but it‚Äôs got a surprisingly slick interface ‚Äì clean, responsive, and it doesn‚Äôt make you dig through a million tabs to add a simple transition. It feels like iMovie‚Äôs cousin who lives on the Windows side of town.

What I liked most was that it struck a balance: not overwhelming for beginners, but also not so barebones that you outgrow it in a week.

# For the ‚ÄúI want full control and I‚Äôm not scared of a learning curve‚Äù folks:

**5. DaVinci Resolve**If you‚Äôre asking ‚Äúhow to download iMovie on Windows 10 for free,‚Äù and someone points you to DaVinci Resolve‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre both right and wrong. Resolve is **free**, insanely powerful, and used by actual movie editors. But it‚Äôs also a beast. If you‚Äôve never touched an editor before, the interface might feel like the cockpit of a spaceship.

That said, if you‚Äôve got the patience to learn, Resolve will carry you from beginner to pro without making you switch tools. I‚Äôd just recommend watching a few intro vids before diving in, or else you might rage-quit by Hour Two.

# Some real talk + personal hacks:

If you‚Äôre truly after that plug-and-play iMovie simplicity, **don‚Äôt** overcomplicate it. Here‚Äôs my current setup for fast edits on a Windows laptop:

* I use Clipchamp for TikToks, fast cuts, and client proofs (stuff where speed > perfection).
* Movavi sits in the middle as my main tool for polished edits when I don‚Äôt need all the bells of Resolve.
* And DaVinci? That‚Äôs my ‚Äúcinematic‚Äù tool ‚Äì when I need that extra shine or am working on a long-term project.

Also, quick tip: if you‚Äôre dealing with laggy playback or slow renders in *any* editor, check your proxy settings. A lot of apps let you create lower-res versions for editing, which you can later swap out for full-res during export. Absolute lifesaver if your PC‚Äôs not packing a GPU the size of a microwave.

# TL;DR version:

* **Can you download iMovie on Windows?** Nope.
* **Is there a perfect iMovie clone?** Not quite, but there are worthy alternatives depending on what you need.
* **Top picks for an iMovie feel:** Clipchamp, Shotcut, and Movavi.
* **Want more control?** Try DaVinci Resolve (with caution and maybe snacks).

If you're coming from Apple‚Äôs world, I get the frustration. The transition can be a pain. But with the right tools (and a bit of patience), you can absolutely get that same smooth editing experience on Windows ‚Äì and maybe even discover features iMovie never had.

Would love to hear what others are using ‚Äì especially if someone‚Äôs found a unicorn that‚Äôs iMovie-level simple *and* PC-native.

The problem I'm having is that if anyone slurps their coffee, she'll point at you and snap ""do not slurp your coffee"" very sternly. I've tried to respect this need she has, because it's clearly a case of misophonia, but I accidentally slurped for half a second in the last meeting and said I was ""on thin ice"". That's not ok with me, and frankly derails our meeting. I just want to explore the different ways I can keep the peace, while still getting to drink my coffee. 

My first instinct is to say ""hey I get that it's an upsetting sound for you, but I promise I didn't mean to upset you, but now you're upsetting me by the way you're talking to me.""
I'm a very blunt and honest person, and I definitely think that some honesty is deserved on this topic, but maybe I need to send her a team's message instead of bringing it up in a meeting? Idk, tell me what you think ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

So what happens at this meetup?

Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 7 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders -22:30). Currently we are averaging 15-25 people turning up.

Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?

No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.

Can I come along?

Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.

What if I don't want alcohol?

No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.

Since after the above people still asked...

I'm ********* is it OK if I come along?

We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Location/Time: Latymers, W6 8BS / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but I'll be there from 18:30.

I want to try getting my mits on a Neo65cu or some sort of TKL... Would love if it was easier to get my hands on different keycap profiles with a nordic layout too...
(Hopefully this formatted correctly)



in order:



Zoom65 v3


-Ewhite finish

-PC plate

-plate and PCB foam, no case foam.

-magnetic suspension

-WS pearl switches 

-AP (POM) screw in stabs (Pink colour)

-Milkyway ""stage warrior"" dye sub cherry profile.

-franken ""Nordic ANSI"" layout.


Notes: It's really bouncy and it would be my favourite if this pcb allowed for ISO support.




Zoom75 Taiga 1 (butterfly)


-Ewhite finish 

-ALU plate-cork plate and PCB foam 

-split o-ring suspension 

-HMX Emo Switches 

-AP (POM) screw in stabs (pink colour) 

-Keyboard Science ""Butterfly girl"" Dyesub Cherry profile

-ISO layout


Notes: It's fine, kind of bouncy from the suspension but i am a little underwhelmed bybthe switches. I might rebuild this with a POM plate, poron foams, and Vivian v2 switches... Dunno.



Zoom75 Taiga 2 (coffee)


-Cafe finish 

-Carbon fibre plate 

-Cork plate and pcb foams, no case foam 

-Split o-ring suspension 

-HMX sunset gleam switches 

-AP (POM) screw in stabs (green colour) 

-KCH nekoccino ABS cherry profile 

-ISO layout


Notes: Big fan... First actual clacky i made, very bright, loud and fun. Like i said before the split o-ring mount adds a bit of bounce which i like. Might try different suspensions eventually.



Zoom75 (LCD)


-Black anodized finish 

-POM plate -all foams 

-gasket mount

-gateron oilking switches 

-WS screw in stabs 

-AlohaKB PTB doubleshot ""doll"" cherry profile 

-franken ""Nordic ANSI"" layout


Notes: My first ever build, it's comfortable to type on and kinda poppy, has a lot of that foam sound... I learned a bit from this one... All foam isn't always the best option and aftermarket stabs are usually the right choice.



Have a Freya ultra next to build, just waiting on a different plate.

1ktlwdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ktlwdb/my_friends_stopped_talking_to_me/,My friends stopped talking to me,"
I (37F) had been really close friends with Chad (33M) and Karen (36F) for a few years. We lived near each other and did everything together ‚Äî worked out, ate meals, had coffee mornings, even grocery runs. Back when we became friends, I was single and just starting to enjoy life a little more. I‚Äôd missed out on a lot when I was younger, so speakeasies, cocktails, and trying new things felt exciting.

Chad (he‚Äôs gay, for context) and I started hanging out a lot. We went out for drinks, sometimes dancing, and we always had fun. But over time, I was drinking every other day, constantly hungover, and spending pretty much all my free time with Chad.

Here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî I‚Äôm not great at communication. I don‚Äôt have much confidence, and I always feel like I‚Äôm bothering people if I reach out or text first. I tend to keep things to myself and just quietly pull back when I‚Äôm overwhelmed. I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends, and I guess I‚Äôve always felt like I don‚Äôt quite fit in or know how to maintain relationships properly.

Eventually, though, the lifestyle started wearing me down. I felt burnt out, suffocated, and like I was losing myself. I mentioned a few times that I wanted to slow down ‚Äî that the drinking and constant socializing just weren‚Äôt working for me anymore. But Chad didn‚Äôt really seem to take it seriously.

Then I started dating someone (who Chad had actually introduced me to). I still made time for Chad and Karen, just not as often ‚Äî and yeah, priorities shift. But I set days aside for us to hang out. Over time, Chad stopped inviting me out, which was fine at first because we were still talking and going to the gym together. Then work got hectic ‚Äî I had multiple deadlines, barely any time for myself ‚Äî and I told them both I was swamped.

After that, they kind of dropped off. Group chat went silent, invites stopped. I reached out and asked if they wanted to hang ‚Äî I got invited to someone‚Äôs house, but then the plans were cancelled. Later, when I invited them to dinner, I got a last-minute text saying the original plans were back on. The whole thing just felt kind of... off.

Eventually, I talked to Chad about it. I told him I felt left out and hurt. He apologized and said he felt abandoned now that I have a boyfriend, but promised we‚Äôd hang more. I really thought we were okay after that.

But nothing changed. Then came Christmas. They sent out a wishlist full of really expensive stuff ‚Äî and they *know* I‚Äôve been struggling financially. Chad kept making comments (half-joking, half-not) about how I should get my boyfriend (who‚Äôs well-off) to buy me things. It made me super uncomfortable. But I still got them most of what they wanted. And after Christmas? Silence.

To be honest I get made fun off for not having designer things, i dont have anything new and flashy to show off which is something they do (and i don‚Äôt judge) i earn well but i have family responsibilities that i cant avoid. They tell me to cut my family off (sometimes tempting) but i love my family despite everything and i feel a strong sense of obligation.

At that point, I didn‚Äôt really try anymore. I figured if they wanted to talk, they would. I‚Äôd still wave and say hi if I saw them around. Chad eventually asked for his house keys back ‚Äî I returned them, no drama.

The last time I saw him was a few days ago. I was stopped in a parking lot lane and he honked at me. I glanced in the rearview mirror and saw him wave, but I just drove off. Today, I checked and realized he blocked me.

I‚Äôm not even sure how to feel. I know I‚Äôm not the best at expressing myself. I try, but I always second-guess it ‚Äî like I‚Äôm annoying or needy or just too much. I feel sad, I don‚Äôt know if I did something wrong, or if this friendship just ran its course. I know i shouldn‚Äôt give much thought to it, and move on but im struggling. I dont have many friends (or any that i can talk to or hang out with often)

Just wanted to let it out.

TL;DR : my friends stopped talking to me and i dont know why, got blocked and i feel like maybe im the problem?

Recently we both came out of some rough relationships mine being with a very physically and emotionally abusive partner and hers with a partner that seemed to be emotionally unavailable, so we both recognize that we have some type of issues with past relationships. 

Her relationship with her ex wasn‚Äôt all to horrible from what she tells me and that her ex wasn‚Äôt a bad person just not her person and they didn‚Äôt really have the same common goals or ambitions and that she felt like she was married to a friend and not a partner or spouse. She didn‚Äôt feel supported and she states that her ex was emotionally unavailable and manipulative in ways that would make her feel like she was walking on egg shells when she would come home. 

Currently she is in the process of working through her divorce and trying to keep it amicable and I‚Äôm still in the middle of my divorce through court proceedings which I can‚Äôt go into detail but it‚Äôs set to end very soon. Here lately her soon to be ex husband had been messaging her and her messaging him asking about how the day was going and just staying cordial from what I know, I can be okay with this even though he still wants her back and I‚Äôve explain to her that as long as she continues to leave that door open for him he will continue to feel like there is that opportunity of reconciliation. Yesterday she went to his house, which was there house, to talk about the divorce papers and had been there for over a hour and never really talked or completed any of the paperwork. She ended up recording the last 12 minutes of the conversation (Unkown to me that she was) and sending it to me, but like I told her I wasn‚Äôt there and 12 minutes of a conversation is only a 1/8th of the moment. I explained to her that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable about the situation and that I didn‚Äôt like that she was going over to his house and being there for so long much less being at his house in general and could have met outside of the house at a coffee shop or something else to go over the divorce papers. After telling her that I havnt had to deal with a relationship like this before where somebody else had a ex that they are still talking too and going to see at there personal residence for some odd amounts of time she ended up going back out there later that evening some few hours or so later for another 30 minutes. I keep telling her that I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable with that and it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt trust her but I don‚Äôt trust the situation. 

She‚Äôs now telling me that she feels like I don‚Äôt trust her and that I cannot in general trust anyone but I truly just don‚Äôt like the idea of her going over to her ex‚Äôs. She‚Äôs tells me that she‚Äôs not in love with him anymore and that she‚Äôs fully invested with me and loves me. She doesn‚Äôt have any ties to her ex other than a vehicle and the rest is being amicably split from what I know.

My divorce is still in process between hair follicle testing and court orders of protection I don‚Äôt have contact with my ex and for good reason. She continues to bring up that she‚Äôs going to have to deal with my ex because I have a child with them and that she is okay with that but that I should be okay with her having the contact with her ex the way she has because her relationship wasn‚Äôt all as bad as mine was with my ex. She keeps bringing up the fact that I was trying to make it work with my ex originally even though they were mentally and physically abusive but the physical abuse didn‚Äôt just happen for a extended period but escalated over a period of 3 months to the point where I ended it after a knife and gun was pulled on me and I filed for divorce from that point forward. 

If there‚Äôs anything that I can add please ask and I will reply within the time I can. Thank you for any perspectives that can be given and have a great day!

Alright, let's be real. We all dream of that perfect beach getaway, don't we? The kind where the sun kisses your skin, the waves lull you into a state of blissful relaxation, and your biggest decision is whether to have another margarita or try that fancy mocktail. But often, the cost of such a dreamy escape feels‚Ä¶ well, astronomical. Flights, hotels, meals, drinks, activities ‚Äì it all adds up faster than you can say ""paradise lost."" That‚Äôs where the magic of affordable all-inclusive beach vacations comes in. Imagine a world where your budget is set before you even pack your swimsuit, where hidden fees are about as common as a snowman on the equator, and where everything you need for a truly unforgettable trip is wrapped up in one tidy package. Sound too good to be true? It‚Äôs not! It‚Äôs about being smart, doing your homework, and knowing where to look. I'm here to tell you from personal experience, it is absolutely possible to experience the joy of an all-inclusive beach vacation without having to take out a second mortgage. Let‚Äôs dive in, shall we?

### Cracking the Code: What Exactly ARE Affordable All Inclusive Beach Vacations?

So, you've heard the term thrown around ‚Äì ""all-inclusive."" But what does it *really* mean, especially when you add ""affordable"" into the mix? Is it just about getting a free breakfast and watery cocktails by the pool? Not at all! When we talk about truly affordable all systems go beach vacations, we‚Äôre talking about a vacation package where a significant chunk of your expenses are bundled into a single price. This usually covers your accommodation, meals, drinks (often including alcoholic beverages!), and sometimes even activities, entertainment, and airport transfers. The ""affordable"" part comes in when you learn the tricks of the trade: knowing the best times to travel, identifying destinations that offer great value, and understanding the different levels of ""all-inclusive"" available. It‚Äôs like getting a super-saver combo meal for your entire trip ‚Äì you know the price upfront, and everything‚Äôs included, no surprises! This isn't about roughing it; it's about smart spending for maximum enjoyment.

Let‚Äôs dig a little deeper into what you can typically expect from an all-inclusive resort, especially when you're aiming for that sweet spot of affordability. While the specifics can vary from place to place, here‚Äôs a general rundown of what‚Äôs usually covered:

- **Accommodation:** This is your home away from home for the duration of your trip, from a standard room to sometimes even ocean-view suites, depending on the resort and your booking.
- **Meals:** Get ready for a culinary adventure! Most all-inclusive resorts offer multiple dining options, from buffet restaurants with a wide variety of dishes to √† la carte specialty restaurants. Look out for places with diverse menus that cater to different tastes.
- **Drinks:** This is often a big draw. Expect unlimited beverages, including soft drinks, juices, coffee, tea, and most importantly, alcoholic drinks like beer, wine, and spirits. Some resorts might have premium brands you can purchase separately, but the standard offerings are usually more than enough to keep you refreshed.
- **Entertainment:** You won't be bored! Resorts often have lively entertainment programs, including live music, shows, themed nights, and even discos.
- **Activities:** From water sports like kayaking, paddleboarding, and snorkeling (sometimes included!) to beach volleyball, fitness classes, and kids' clubs, there's usually plenty to keep you busy.
- **Tips and Gratuities:** In many cases, gratuities for staff are included in the all-inclusive price, saving you the hassle of constantly figuring out how much to tip. Though it‚Äôs always a nice gesture to give a little extra for exceptional service!

It's worth noting that not all ""all-inclusive"" packages are created equal. Some might include limited access to √† la carte restaurants, while others offer unlimited visits. Some might include motorize water sports, while others only offer non-motorized options. Always read the fine print and understand what's included before you book! It‚Äôs like comparing different insurance plans ‚Äì you gotta know what you're getting and what you're not.

### The Savvy Traveler's Toolkit: Finding Those Diamond-in-the-Rough Destinations

Okay, so we know *what* affordable systems go beach vacations are, but *where* do you find them? You can't just blindly point at a map and hope for the best, although that sometimes works for life decisions, vacation destinations require a little more strategy! The key is to look beyond the usual suspects, the mega-famous destinations that everyone flocks to. While those places are undeniably beautiful, their popularity often translates to higher prices. We're talking about finding those hidden gems, the places that offer incredible value without sacrificing that quintessential beach vacation experience.

#### Beyond the Postcard: Exploring Value-Packed Beach Destinations

Thinking outside the box when it comes to beach destinations can seriously pay off. Here are a few types of places that are often ripe for finding affordable all-inclusive deals:

1. **Emerging Destinations:** These are places that are gaining popularity but haven‚Äôt yet reached peak ""tourist trap"" status. Think destinations in Central America (like Nicaragua or Honduras, with their beautiful Pacific and Caribbean coastlines), some less-hyped Caribbean islands (like the Dominican Republic or parts of Mexico's less-travelled coasts), or even coastal regions in Southeast Asia that are still developing their tourism infrastructure.
2. **Shoulder Season Savvy:** Traveling during the shoulder season ‚Äì the periods just before or after the peak tourist season ‚Äì can result in significantly lower prices. The weather is often still fantastic, and the crowds are much smaller. This is a really smart move, believe you me.
3. **Lesser-Known Coastal Regions:** Even within popular countries, there are often coastal regions that are less famous than the headline destinations. For example, while Cancun and Riviera Maya are well-known in Mexico, areas like the Pacific coast (Puerto Vallarta, Huatulco) or parts of the Yucatan Peninsula that are further from the main tourist hubs can offer more affordable options.
4. **Countries with Favorable Exchange Rates:** The strength of your home currency compared to the local currency of your destination can have a huge impact on affordability. Do your research and see where your dollar (or euro, or pound!) will go further.

Finding these places takes a bit of research, but it's so worth it. It's like finding a hidden treasure chest ‚Äì the reward is immense!

### Timing is Everything: When to Snag the Sweetest Deals

Just like buying airline tickets, the timing of your vacation can drastically affect the price. Trying to book an affordable all-inclusive beach vacation during peak Christmas week or spring break? Good luck! Unless you have deep pockets, you're likely to be swimming against the tide of sky-high prices. But fear not, there are definite sweet spots in the calendar year that can help you score a fantastic deal.

#### The Art of the Off-Peak Pickle: Navigating Seasonal Pricing

Understanding seasonal pricing is crucial to finding affordable all-inclusive beach vacations. Here's the general breakdown:

- **Peak Season:** This is when everyone wants to travel ‚Äì typically during major holidays, school breaks, and when the weather is considered ideal in that particular destination. Prices are highest during this time, and resorts are often fully booked. Buckle up, because prices are usually through the roof!
- **Shoulder Season:** As I mentioned before, this is the magical time between peak and off-peak. The weather is usually still good, and prices are lower because there's less demand. This is often the *best* time to find affordable all-inclusive deals. Think late spring, early fall, or just after major holiday rushes.
- **Off-Peak Season:** This is the least popular time to visit, often due to weather conditions (rainy season, hurricane season) or simply being outside of major holiday periods. While prices are lowest during off-peak, you run the risk of less-than-ideal weather or some resort amenities being closed or operating on reduced schedules. It‚Äôs a bit of a gamble, but sometimes it really pays off! Do your homework on the typical weather patterns before you commit.

Beyond the general seasons, keep an eye out for last-minute deals or promotions that resorts might offer to fill empty rooms. Signing up for newsletters from travel websites and resorts can give you a heads-up on these opportunities. It's about being agile and ready to pounce when a good deal pops up.

### Digging Deeper: Understanding the Nuances of ""Affordable""

""Affordable"" is a relative term, right? What feels affordable to one person might feel like a king's ransom to another. When it comes to cheap all-inclusive beach vacations, it's not just about the sticker price of the package. You need to consider the overall value you're getting and what's *not* included. Sometimes a slightly more expensive package upfront might save you money in the long run because it includes things that other resorts charge extra for. It‚Äôs like buying generic vs. brand name ‚Äì sometimes the generic is just as good, but sometimes the brand name is worth the extra pennies.

#### Beyond the Headline Price: Hidden Costs and Budget Busters to Watch For

While all-inclusive packages aim to minimize surprises, they aren't always *completely* all-encompassing. Knowing what's typically *not* included in a standard affordable package is crucial for budgeting and avoiding unexpected expenses:

- **Flights:** Unless you book a package deal that includes airfare, flights are usually an additional cost. And flights can be real budget busters, let‚Äôs be honest.
- **Airport Transfers:** Some all-inclusive packages include transfers between the airport and the resort, but many don't. Research shuttle services or taxi costs beforehand.
- **Excursions and Tours:** Want to go zip-lining, visit historical sites, or go on a boat trip? These activities are almost always an extra cost. Budget for these if you plan on doing more than just lounging by the pool.
- **Premium Drinks and Specialty Restaurants:** As I mentioned earlier, some resorts charge extra for top-shelf liquor or dining at their most exclusive √† la carte restaurants.
- **Spa Treatments:** Massages, facials, and other spa services are typically an additional expense.
- **Souvenirs and Shopping:** If you plan on bringing back gifts or treating yourself, factor in shopping money.
- **Travel Insurance:** While not mandatory, travel insurance is highly recommended to protect yourself against unexpected events like trip cancellations or medical emergencies. It's just plain smart to have it.

By being aware of these potential extra costs, you can create a more accurate overall budget for your affordable all-inclusive beach vacation and avoid any unpleasant financial surprises. It's all part of being a savvy traveler.

### The Digital Dive: Leveraging Websites and Resources

Finding affordable all-inclusive beach vacations in this day and age is easier than ever thanks to the magic of the internet. There's a treasure trove of websites, travel agencies, and deal aggregators out there, just waiting to help you find your perfect getaway at the right price. But it's not just about clicking on the first ad you see; it's about knowing where to look and how to use these resources effectively. Think of it as having a whole team of personal shoppers for your vacation ‚Äì you just have to tell them what you‚Äôre looking for!

#### Your Online Allies: Websites and Tools for Finding Deals

Here are some types of online resources that can be invaluable in your quest for affordable all-inclusive beach vacations:

- **Online Travel Agencies (OTAs):** Websites like Expedia, Booking.com, and Priceline are great for comparing prices across different resorts and even bundling flights and hotels for potential savings.
- **Deal Aggregators and Comparison Sites:** Websites like Kayak, Google Flights, and Skyscanner allow you to compare flight prices from various airlines and track price trends. They can also help you find hotel deals.
- **All-Inclusive Specific Websites:** Some websites specialize in all-inclusive vacation packages, like CheapCaribbean or Apple Vacations. These sites often have deals and promotions specific to this type of travel.
- **Resort Websites:** Don't forget to check the resorts' own websites! They often have special offers or packages that you won't find elsewhere.
- **Groupon and LivingSocial:** These deal websites sometimes feature heavily discounted all-inclusive vacation packages. It‚Äôs worth checking, you never know what you might find!
- **Social Media and Travel Blogs:** Follow travel influencers, resorts, and travel agencies on social media for flash sales and promotional codes. Travel blogs can also provide valuable insights and recommendations for affordable destinations and resorts.

Persistence is key! Check multiple sources, compare prices, and be flexible with your dates if possible. Sometimes the best deals require a little flexibility.

### It's All About Value: Choosing the Right Resort for Your Buck

Not all all-inclusive resorts are created equal, especially when you're looking for affordability. Some might skimp on food quality, entertainment options, or even the cleanliness of the rooms. It‚Äôs a balancing act ‚Äì you want a good price, but you also want a good experience. So, how do you choose a resort that offers great value for your hard-earned cash?

#### From Basic to Brilliant: Assessing Resort Value for Affordable All Inclusive Beach Vacations

When evaluating different resorts for your affordable all-inclusive beach vacation, consider these factors:

- **Reviews and Ratings:** This is huge! Read reviews from other travelers on websites like TripAdvisor and Google Reviews. Pay attention to comments about the food, service, cleanliness, and overall atmosphere. Look for consistent positive feedback, and be wary of resorts with a high number of negative reviews.
- **Included Amenities and Activities:** Make a list of the things that are important to you. Do you want a wide variety of dining options? Are you interested in specific water sports? Is a lively nightlife scene a priority? Compare the included amenities of different resorts to see which ones best meet your needs and offer the most value.
- **Location:** How important is it for you to be right on the beach? Is the resort within walking distance of any shops or restaurants (if that's something you care about)? Consider the location and how it aligns with your interests.
- **Family-Friendly vs. Adults-Only:** All-inclusive resorts cater to different demographics. If you're traveling with kids, look for family-friendly resorts with dedicated pools, kids' clubs, and age-appropriate activities. If you're looking for a romantic getaway, an adults-only resort might be a better fit.
- **The ""Vibe"":** Does the resort seem like a party spot, a relaxing oasis, or something in between? Look at pictures and read reviews to get a sense of the resort's atmosphere and whether it aligns with what you're looking for.

Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions! If something isn‚Äôt clear on the resort's website, contact them directly or ask questions in online travel forums. Getting a clear picture of what you're getting is crucial.

### Beyond the Resort Walls: Exploring the Local Scene (Sometimes Included, Sometimes Not!)

While the beauty of an all-inclusive vacation is that everything you need is right at your fingertips, it‚Äôs also nice to venture out and experience the local culture and attractions. This is where the affordability aspect of your trip might require a little extra planning, as most excursions and outings outside the resort aren't included in the standard all-inclusive price.

#### Stepping Out: Budgeting for Local Adventures

Venturing beyond the resort can enrich your travel experience, but it does add to your overall costs. Here's how to approach it when you're aiming for an affordable all-inclusive beach vacation:

- **Research Excursion Costs in Advance:** Look online for local tour operators and compare prices for the activities that interest you. This will give you a realistic idea of how much you'll need to budget for outings.
- **Consider Public Transportation or Taxis:** Taxis can be expensive in some destinations. See if there are reliable and safe public transportation options available for getting around.
- **Look for Free or Low-Cost Activities:** Explore local markets, stroll along the beach outside the resort, or visit public parks. Many destinations have free or inexpensive ways to experience the local culture.
- **Factor in Meals and Drinks Outside the Resort:** If you plan on eating at local restaurants, remember to budget for those meals and drinks.
- **Negotiate Prices (Where Culturally Acceptable):** In some destinations, it's customary to negotiate prices with taxi drivers or vendors in markets. Do your research on local customs before attempting to negotiate.

Balancing relaxation at the resort with exploring the local scene is a great way to get the most out of your affordable all-inclusive beach vacation. It‚Äôs about finding that sweet spot between convenience and exploration.

### The Packing Puzzle: What to Bring (and What to Leave Behind!)

Packing for any trip can be a bit of a puzzle, but when you're heading to an all-inclusive beach vacation, there are a few specific things to consider to make your life easier and potentially save you some money. You don't want to be caught short, but you also don't want to haul unnecessary stuff halfway across the world.

#### Packing Smart: Tips for an Affordable All Inclusive Beach Vacation

Here are some packing tips to keep in mind:

1. **Sun Protection is Key:** Sunscreen, hats, and sunglasses can be expensive at resort gift shops. Bring plenty from home.
2. **Reusable Water Bottle:** Stay hydrated and reduce plastic waste by bringing your own reusable water bottle. Many resorts have water stations where you can refill.
3. **Basic First-Aid Kit:** Pack essentials like pain relievers, band-aids, antiseptic wipes, and any personal medications. You don‚Äôt want to have to buy these at inflated resort prices.
4. **Beach Towels:** While most resorts provide beach towels, bringing your own can be a good idea, especially if you plan on venturing off the resort.
5. **Insect Repellent:** Depending on your destination, mosquitoes and other biting insects can be an issue, especially in the evenings.
6. **Casual Clothing and Swimwear:** All-inclusive beach vacations are generally laid-back, so pack comfortable clothing suitable for warm weather. Don't forget multiple swimsuits!
7. **A Few Dressier Outfits:** Some resorts have dress codes for their √† la carte restaurants in the evenings, so pack a couple of slightly dressier options just in case.
8. **Power Adapter and Converter:** If you're traveling internationally, make sure you have the right adapter and converter for your electronics.
9. **Books, Magazines, or E-reader:** All-inclusive vacations are perfect for relaxing, so bring something to read by the pool or on the beach.

By packing smart, you can avoid having to buy overpriced items at the resort and have everything you need for a comfortable and enjoyable trip. It‚Äôs about being prepared without overpacking.

### Thinking Outside the All-Inclusive Box: Other Budget-Friendly Beach Getaway Options

While affordable systems go beach vacations are a fantastic way to budget and relax, they aren't the *only* way to have a cost-effective beach getaway. Sometimes exploring other options can open up even more possibilities, especially if the traditional all-inclusive format isn't quite your cup of tea.

#### Beyond the Resort Bubble: Exploring Alternatives for a Frugal Beach Trip

If a traditional all-inclusive isn't the right fit, consider these alternatives for a more budget-conscious beach vacation:

- **Self-Catering Apartments or Villas:** Renting a place with a kitchen allows you to cook some of your own meals, which can significantly reduce food costs compared to eating out for every meal.
- **Budget-Friendly Hotels with Kitchenettes:** Some hotels offer rooms with kitchenettes, providing a similar advantage to self-catering apartments but with some hotel amenities like daily housekeeping.
- **Hostels with Private Rooms:** If you're comfortable with a more communal atmosphere, hostels can be a very affordable accommodation option. Many offer private rooms if you prefer more privacy.
- **Camping or Glamping:** For a truly budget-conscious and adventurous beach trip, consider camping or glamping if it's an option in your desired destination.
- **Focus on Destinations with Lower Costs of Living:** Choose countries or regions where the cost of food, transportation, and activities is generally lower.

These options require a bit more planning and budgeting for individual expenses, but they can offer more flexibility and a different kind of travel experience. It's about finding the approach that best suits your travel style and budget.

### The Grand Finale: Making Your Affordable All Inclusive Beach Vacation a Reality

So, you've got the knowledge, you‚Äôve done the research, and you‚Äôre ready to book that dream beach vacation without having to raid your piggy bank (or, let‚Äôs be honest, remortgage your house).

#### Bringing it All Together: Your Action Plan for an Affordable Escape

2. **Research Value-Packed Destinations:** Look into the emerging and less-hyped coastal regions offering great value.
3. **Identify the Best Time to Travel:** Consider shoulder season for lower prices and good weather.
4. **Utilize Online Resources:** Use OTAs, deal aggregators, and resort websites to find and compare prices.
5. **Read Reviews and Assess Resort Value:** Don't just go for the cheapest option; look for a resort that offers good value based on reviews and included amenities.
6. **Plan for Excursions and Extra Costs:** Budget for activities outside the resort and any other potential expenses.
7. **Pack Smart:** Bring essential items from home to avoid inflated resort prices.

Three summers ago I sent out a newsletter titled ""5 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Me."" A few years have gone by, and now, I present you with five more.

1. I'm on the Lumley Community Betterment Committee.

And what a mouthful that is to say out loud. The committee was formed in 2023 and comprises both staff and Perryville residents. We brainstorm ideas for bettering the unit. I don't mean huge undertakings like a swimming pool and a dog park. We're more like an event-planning committee -- feasible events that boost morale, add some fun, and foster social interaction.

Last December, we hosted a holiday card-making event and sent our creations to local retirement homes. In the spacious visitation room, we set up stations of colorful card stock, tempera paint, markers, glue, and glitter. We painted and colored while Christmas music played and holiday cards stacked up.

More recently, we painted ""kindness rocks"" to be planted in discoverable places across Maricopa County. Using acrylic paint under the watchful eye of staff, we decorated each rock with inspirational quotes, memes, Bible scriptures, crosses, cactuses, hearts, flowers, rainbows, even piebald cow patterns. One woman turned each of her rocks into SpongeBob characters.

Some women who thought they were being clever painted their inmate numbers on the backs of their rocks, a sort of covert message in a bottle. Some painted ""HELP ME!"" and a few even painted their TikTok handles. Staff filtered these out of the bunch.

We painted over one hundred rocks that day. One of the admin secretaries took them to various public spaces and left these little gems in places where random people might find them and enjoy them -- because kindness rocks.

2. I've taken two college courses since coming to Perryville.

I had a lot of anxiety while enrolled because I dropped out of high school and felt I had something to prove to myself. I proved it, earning a 4.0 in both courses, but the whole time I hated it. The pressure I had placed on myself to get a perfect grade-point average was too much.

I felt more imprisoned while enrolled, and when the courses were finally over, I felt something akin to freedom again. I joked to a few friends, ""I want a degree but I don't want to do all the work!"" Still, I'll probably reenroll after PCR (post-conviction relief).

3. I'm the Lumley newsletter's photographer.

This came about through a little serendipity. Another woman wanted the position and the editor told me she probably wouldn't get it because she had just gotten in trouble. She suggested I ask an officer who doubled as the newsletter's executive editor.

Now, I run around with a little Olympus camera not too unlike one I bought twenty years ago. I take photos of events and women who have accomplished something noteworthy. I happened to have the camera when April showed up, which is how I managed a selfie with her perched on my palm.

4. I've become one hell of a baker.

Recently, I made cinnamon-roll French toast topped with candied almonds, sliced bananas, and a caramel syrup drizzle. That doesn't really count as baking, but it was rich and dessert-y. It spiked my blood sugar, which crashed hard later, so I vowed to never eat it again.

Before that, I made banana-cream cheesecake. I've also made chocolate cheesecake, coffee cheesecake, mocha cheesecake, and coconut cheesecake. Of course, I improvise a little, but I've got all the main ingredients to bake a legitimate cheesecake in the microwave.

The secret to cooking it evenly is to put it in for 20 seconds at a time, stir it briskly, then 20 more seconds, and so on. Once it gets very hot, I pour that over a graham-cracker crust that I've prebaked, and pop the whole shebang back in the microwave to finish it off for another 5 seconds. Then, I chill the cake on ice for 3 hours.

My cheesecakes have become legendary on the yard. They're also pricey for me, given the quality ingredients I use, so I can't make them every week.

Most recently, I made chocolate-banana-cream cheesecake. I think I outdid myself.

5. I sang the National Anthem at a softball game this year.

When I lived in east Mesa, my home had a large unfurnished room with hardwood floors. The acoustics were ideal so when I was alone, I would belt out ""The Star Spangled Banner,"" imagining that one day I would sing it in front of a real crowd.

When I moved back to Yreka in April 2008, I told my sister that singing it was on my list of goals for the year. She suggested I ask Jerry (not his real name) if I could sing it at the racetrack. According to her, ""He'll let anyone sing."" Low bar? My chances were looking good.

My uncle John Arnberg had raced his car on that track for years. He was well-liked in the Yreka community and died unexpectedly in his houseboat from carbon-monoxide poisoning. A memorial race in honor of him was on the schedule.

Jerry coordinated the races, but he also managed the local ampm gas station. I headed over there to inquire, and the cashier directed me to his office.

""Can you sing?"" he asked.

""I think so.""

""Okay,"" he said with a simple shrug. No tryouts needed.

On May 24, 2008, I stood with mic in hand before 300 or so people, very nervous, and began to sing. I heard my own voice booming back at me through the speakers, a short feedback loop letting me know I was on key.

My cousin, Uncle John's daughter, loved it. My grandpa actually shed a tear. My sister recorded it. My mom and dad were late and missed the whole thing.

I nailed it, which is probably why I thought I could sing it again 17 years later before a softball game between Lumley Unit and Santa Rosa Unit. Of course, I warmed up, but years of not singing had not done my vocal chords any favors. My voice sounded strained and like that of a smoker's.

There was one cool part, though. Luke Air Force Base is ten miles away (seven, as the jet flies), and Perryville is in the flight path as fighter pilots go out daily for drills. As I neared the song's conclusion, a loud F-35 flew over. God bless America.

1ktle1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/PDAAutism/comments/1ktle1i/salient_x_local_processingfirst/,Salient x Local processing-first,"I want to discuss something based on the following example:

I am looking at an extremely busy and hectic road scene. There are many different types of cars passing, taxi‚Äôs, vans, small buses of all kinds of brands. I notice immediately the typical French shape of cars. Some of the cars are zigzagging a bit in their own lane. There is a suitcase standing a bit far from the person sitting at a coffee table outside. 4 people with cowboy hats just walked by, walking very animatedly. There is an interesting pattern of light emerging on the road, due to the shadow of the leaves of the trees next to the road.

(End example)

I came across the Weak Central Coherence (WCC) theory of autism, stating that autistic people have a brain that works based on ‚Äòlocal‚Äô over ‚Äòglobal‚Äô processing.

Like I think I get the global idea of a road scene. However what makes it interesting are exactly salient details that add up to this specific road scene.

Similarly, a common example for WCC is that autistic people don‚Äôt see or miss the forest, and that we actually see ‚Äòmoss patches, specific bark texture, and insect patterns‚Äô.

But I think this might be a again case of, we do get what a forest is, it‚Äôs just that we are interested in what specific forest we are talking about.

Many of us PDA are also spatial visualisers, so all of these ‚Äòdetails‚Äô as some call it might actually create the specific space (whether roadscene or forest) we can visualise.

So yes, we might be local processing first , but it might be about describing ‚Äòsalient‚Äô and local sensory signals - things that are relevant/unique.

This is more speculative thinking, but what if we live or should live in a mode of describing what‚Äôs salient right in front of us, what we concretely see or hear.

Does any of this resonate?",1,1748011586.0,PDAAutism,1,1.0,False
1ktldqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ktldqu/my_wife_underwent_exposure_therapy_to_cure_her/,"My wife underwent exposure therapy to cure her arachnophobia, but it worked too well and now she‚Äôs freaking me out","I don‚Äôt like spiders. I don‚Äôt like it when they bunch themselves up so their legs look like tangled wires, and I don‚Äôt like it when they spread themselves out like the radial spokes on a wheel. It was bad luck that when I met my wife we discovered we were both scared of them. As the man I kinda just wound up taking over spider killing duty. At first this meant squealing while trying to lob a shoe at one of them from a distance, but as the years went on I kinda just got tired of the stress and anxiety. Fear is exhausting. So is the pageantry of it. Jumping up and shouting and lots of running around. Over time I found myself having less and less of a fear reaction to them. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I didn‚Äôt want one crawling on my face, but it wasn‚Äôt like they had me running away in fear every time.

Lily was never great with them either, but it wasn‚Äôt what I‚Äôd call worthy of therapy. For the first ten years I knew her, she was a fairly run-of-the-mill arachnophobe. Things only got bad after this one night when we‚Äôd just come back in from an evening with friends. There‚Äôd been a storm outside. Windy as hell. I remember putting the keys down on the table by the door and when I looked back she was pulling down the hood of her coat. She let out a sigh, ran her hands through her hair, and she looked a little puzzled by what she‚Äôd felt. When she lifted her hand away there were thin black legs poking out from between her fingers. It took a second for her to react to what was all bunched up inside her cupped hand, then she screamed and threw it onto the ground. I saw it for only a second. It was so fast. Then it was off and under the nearest door and my number one concern became comforting my wife who was having a full blown panic attack.¬†

‚ÄúGet it off get it off¬†*get it off!*‚Äù She screamed while slapping at her neck and hair. I hugged her tight, checked her hair and then checked it again when she asked me to. Then she stripped her top off to make sure nothing else was clinging to her clothes, before I took her into the kitchen and we had a cup of tea while she kept scratching at the back of her head.¬†

‚ÄúLittle fucker,‚Äù she half-cried, half-laughed. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it. Did you see it? It was huge!‚Äù

‚ÄúOne of the biggest yet,‚Äù I said. Truthfully, I only had half-glimpsed memories of it scuttling away but it¬†*had*¬†been big. Large enough that a pint glass wouldn‚Äôt have fit over its darting legs. Just seeing it had left me feeling anxious, but at the time I ignored my own discomfort. After all, I‚Äôd hardly been the real victim.¬†

‚ÄúAnd it got away!‚Äù She cringed. ‚ÄúOh God. It‚Äôs still in this house somewhere, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

I wanted to lie but thought better of it.¬†

‚ÄúSomewhere, yeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôll spider proof the bedroom tonight and I‚Äôll go looking in the morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù She smiled mournfully. ‚ÄúJesus. I just know I‚Äôm going to have a hard time sleeping tonight.‚Äù

She made me strip the bed before she got in it. And all night she kept flicking at her fringe and the hair on the back of her neck. I felt so bad for her. If that had been me I can‚Äôt say I would have reacted much better. Neither of us slept that well, but I was mostly just worried about her. When you love someone, it‚Äôs tough to see them suffer.¬†

But it wasn‚Äôt just that one night. The second one was much the same. The third, fourth, and so on. It petered out a little in the second week but then she saw a spider on some tv show and the anxiety came back full force. Every night was the same. I had to strip the bed of everything, lift the mattress, and check for spiders. She even got rid of her bedside table so there‚Äôd be less hiding places for one.¬†

In the meantime I was on hunting duty. In her own words, I had to find the bastard or she‚Äôd never feel safe in that house again. It‚Äôs funny but in hindsight I can‚Äôt really say¬†*what*¬†I saw go scuttling under the doorway that first night, but I do know I didn‚Äôt try all that hard to find it. I remember finding some webs under the living room sofa that were real odd. The fibres were thick like the fake stuff they bring out on halloween, and I had to peel them off the carpet like velcro. I found a couple of these nests throughout the house, but I never mentioned them. One of them hid a hole in the floor that really should have alarmed me, but I just ignored it.

I ignored a lot, actually. I found dead mice spun up in cocoons and something bore a hole through one of the kitchen cupboards and filled it with silk. Nothing normal about that, but I just covered it up with some cans and moved on. A behaviour I find hard to explain in hindsight.

Maybe my attention was elsewhere. Lily wasn‚Äôt in a great place, and she was slowly getting worse. She cried a lot, and any little thing that touched her skin would result in lots of panicked yelling. She couldn‚Äôt eat a meal without slapping at her arms and neck every few seconds. Things got real bad when I came back one night to find her shaving her head. She told me she got tired of mistaking the feeling of her own hair for a spider, so this was the simplest way to feel clean and safe. If you‚Äôve ever lived with anyone who‚Äôs had a breakdown, there‚Äôs usually this moment where your heart sinks as you realise that what you‚Äôre dealing with has transcended the norm. It‚Äôs quite frightening actually. Reminded me of when my mum found a lump. It‚Äôs a very isolating sort of fear. I remember lying awake in bed that night and just thinking about how I‚Äôd found Lily bent over the bath, shaver in hand, with a patchy head like that doll from Toy Story. When she looked over her shoulder at me she smiled and her eyes were so wide, I felt like I wasn‚Äôt looking at my wife anymore.¬†

Have you ever missed someone while you still live with them? Made them coffee and breakfast and chatted about your day, but it‚Äôs like nobody‚Äôs there? Everyday was the same. I‚Äôd tell her about work, and she‚Äôd tell me about how she‚Äôd scrubbed the bedroom top to bottom looking for spiders, or started pulling up the bathroom tiles to check for nests. At one point I realised she‚Äôd taken a lot of time off work but she wouldn't give me a straight answer so I had to call her office. They wouldn‚Äôt even answer my calls, which I had to take as a pretty bad sign.

It came as a relief when she got sectioned. Everything came out all at once. She‚Äôd tried putting a hammer to one of the walls to find what was behind it, not realising that it was just the neighbour‚Äôs living room on the other side. I was at work during all this, but things clearly escalated pretty quickly and the police arrived to find a partially bald woman screaming about spiders in the walls. By the time I got home they‚Äôd already taken her to be assessed at the local hospital. I rushed to visit her but in the meantime I had to call her parents and it was‚Ä¶ well it was a relief because I wasn‚Äôt alone anymore. Other people knew what was going on and that made it a little easier for me to navigate. Until then I‚Äôd been afraid to mention it to anyone. I guess I was a little embarrassed, or maybe just not sure what the etiquette was for discussing someone else‚Äôs mental health.

She was only gone about a night. Not even twelve hours really. The neighbours agreed not to press charges if I paid for all the repairs and Lily got therapy. Lily‚Äôs parents are quite well off, so they helped us out with that. They found this clinic that she stayed at for a couple of weeks. It specialised in exposure therapy which really just means getting a person used to their phobia. Don‚Äôt like water? Spend hours every day in a pool. Don‚Äôt like moths? Step into a room with thousands of them. This is oversimplification, of course. It‚Äôs a special program that involves gradual increases in the nature of the exposure. The first night she called me and told me they‚Äôd had her looking at pictures of a spider and talking about her experience. They were literally just cartoony drawings, but she told me she found it hard anyway. She cried and I cried too. She was only a few hours drive away but I didn‚Äôt want to be away from her and everything had happened so suddenly. It was only six weeks between that night with the storm and her ending up in that clinic, but in that short period of time I felt like the ground had fallen from beneath my feet.

Two weeks she was in there. I don‚Äôt remember them well. There were phone calls every night. She was getting better, she told me. And the doctor confirmed as much. Hard going, for sure. They had to sedate her the day she graduated from cartoons to actual photos of spiders. Apparently she scratched an orderly up real bad.¬†

My time in the house was lonely. Little weird too, if I‚Äôm honest. I woke up at one point with cobwebs in my hair, and at some point I realised that I hadn‚Äôt seen a spider in my home for a long time. Not even a little money spider. I briefly wondered about what the hell had been leaving cobwebs around the place, but never followed up on it. It‚Äôs hard to get my thoughts straight. I do remember finding more dead mice all webbed up in the back of that kitchen cupboard. One morning I came down to find a starling cocooned on the outside of the kitchen window. No sign of what did it thought. I just stared at it and sipped my coffee, then I left for work and when I came back it was gone.¬†

Probably not a good time to tell you I was diagnosed with a kind of dementia some time ago. I guess that‚Äôs supposed to help make sense of things, right? I don‚Äôt know. Doesn‚Äôt feel like it makes sense to me. It‚Äôs not like Alzheimer‚Äôs runs in my family. They say the neurons of a human brain with Alzheimer‚Äôs look like a cobweb that‚Äôs had holes poked in it. That‚Äôs a good way to describe how my mind feels to live inside. Thoughts travel along a given route and then just‚Ä¶ drop off.¬†

Lily‚Äôs therapy progressed nicely though. I remember that quite clearly. The phone calls and the sound of her voice. Real vivid. Jesus I missed her so bad during this time. I hate being overly sentimental but it had been a tough and lonely six weeks, and hearing her sound increasingly happy and confident with each new phone call was like a shot of pure happiness right into my veins. I missed her, and I wanted her back. And when she told me, giggling with joy, that she‚Äôd held a little spider on day ten I burst out crying right with her. I felt pride at her accomplishment, and I felt relief that things might be getting back on track for us. Like the nightmare was finally gonna be over.

It wasn‚Äôt so simple when I saw her in person. She came back looking like the war wounded. I should say she looked beautiful, but I want to be honest. I smiled when I saw her but it didn‚Äôt reach my eyes because the woman who got into the car looked a lifetime apart from the woman who‚Äôd been living with me just a few months ago. She was thin as a rake, with ashy pallid skin and a shaved head that made her look like a matchstick. And her eyes, the look in them wasn‚Äôt right. But she was smiling, so I swallowed the funny feeling I had in my stomach and pretended everything was okay.

There was no work for her to go back to, and I managed to get some time off after speaking to my boss. It was just us and that can be a weird feeling for a couple used to working 9 to 5. I was on edge. Didn‚Äôt know what to expect. She smiled a lot. Tried her best to reassure me, and I asked a lot about what therapy was like and she told me it was fantastic. Showed me photos of her sitting next to big house spiders, some as wide as her palm. Had to fight back my own fear while looking at them. She told me that was day 13, but when I asked what happened on day 14 she said it was mostly just packing up and saying goodbye.¬†

There is a dark and uncomfortable truth to relationships, and it‚Äôs that time only flows in one direction. My wife hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong and I didn‚Äôt really feel any ill will towards her, but a distance had been placed between us. All the best will in the world couldn‚Äôt undo it. She‚Äôd changed. Been changed, I guess. At the time I didn‚Äôt know how to understand any of it, but I wasn‚Äôt sure how to treat her. When I kissed her it was on the cheek. When I held her, it was like hugging a female coworker. I didn‚Äôt know what my own feelings were, and I wouldn‚Äôt until I found her one morning in the kitchen tapping away at a pint glass and giggling like a toddler. It wasn‚Äôt the light and airy laughter of the woman I was used to. It was more like the laughter of a bunch of kids egging on a fight or cheering on a nasty bully.¬†

She didn‚Äôt speak when she looked at me. She just turned back to the glass and kept laughing, flicking it gently with her fingers. When I walked around the table I saw it under there. A¬†*very*¬†large house spider. I don‚Äôt know what is normal for people around the world, but a UK house spider is big if its legs are wider than the palm of your hand. This thing was even bigger with legs bundled up against the side of the glass like spools of segmented wool, and seeing it made me jump way back. I realised I hadn‚Äôt seen another spider since the night of the storm, and that thing all curled up with legs as thick as hairpins was a real shock to my system. I cried out and my wife‚Ä¶ She started¬†*howling*¬†with laughter. I mean, it was like a toddler discovering cartoons for the first time. Manic and weird and just so fucking happy but in a way that was a little alien because I didn‚Äôt understand the thoughts and feelings that went into that ear splitting cackle and it was all wrong coming from her.¬†

I waited for her to say something, but she didn‚Äôt. She just laughed until something in her got tired and she slowly stopped giggling but she¬†*still*¬†didn‚Äôt say anything even after she‚Äôd gone quiet. In the end it was me who broke the silence. I didn‚Äôt have a clue what to say. The whole time she was staring at me with her patchy hair and gleeful teary eyes and I got so desperate to break the stand off that I stammered out the words,

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a big one, ain‚Äôt he?‚Äù

Her face relaxed. Her shoulders slumped. She slipped out of the crazy like it was only ever an outfit.¬†

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll get bigger,‚Äù she said.¬†

And then she lifted the glass, snatched the spider up, and stuffed it into her mouth. I didn‚Äôt see it. Not fully. But I stood, frozen in terror, and watched the muscles in her badly shaved head tense and relax as her jaw worked away, crunching at those hardened legs. Jesus Christ‚Ä¶ the sounds were bad enough but when she was done, she looked over her shoulder at me and smiled and her teeth were smeared green and black with littles of bits of leg and chitin still stuck between the gums.¬†

I‚Äôm not entirely sure what happened next, but now I knew why I‚Äôd felt so different around her since she‚Äôd come back. I was afraid of her, like a kid around an abusive parent. I just didn‚Äôt know what I was gonna get. There was always this energy in the room that had me on edge. I‚Äôd sit there watching tv but I wasn‚Äôt¬†*really*¬†watching. Couldn‚Äôt have told you what was on half-the-time. Instead every ounce of my being was focused on her. Every breath. Every motion. When she got up to use the toilet I watched her intensely to see what she was going to do. The fact that she rarely did anything except carry on as normal was all the more unsettling because I¬†*knew*¬†something was wrong and I couldn‚Äôt stop remembering the way she‚Äôd laughed with that thing under the glass.¬†

Nights were bad. A lot of the time I‚Äôd wake and get the feeling she‚Äôd just been watching me but she was usually fast asleep, or at least that‚Äôs how it looked. Sometimes there were furtive movements like she‚Äôd¬†*just*¬†rolled over. I got used to it, thought it was probably just in my head. But then one night I woke up and she was right there, face inches away from mine. I cried out. Couldn‚Äôt help it. Shuffled backwards while trying to avoid touching her and wound up falling off the bed. When I looked up from the floor she had a completely blank expression. She was just looking at me like a cat watching a fly.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I cried out, unable to stop the irritation from bleeding into my voice.¬†

She shrugged.¬†

‚ÄúJust watching.‚Äù

Then she rolled over like nothing had happened.¬†

That night I slept on the sofa. She didn‚Äôt ask why. Didn‚Äôt say a word as I grabbed my things and left the bedroom. I wasn‚Äôt sure I would manage to fall asleep after that, but I did. And when I woke up I had cobwebs in my hair.¬†

I was lucky if I slept more than a few hours a night after that. It came fitfully, if at all. I woke up too many times to the feeling of something tickling my face and chest, a sensation like someone running a feather over me. Every time I‚Äôd come to in a panic, but I never found anything except nearly-invisible silk clinging to my skin. Life without sleep was difficult, and I struggled to hide my dislike for Lily. Over time our habits and routines diverged even further apart. I stopped going upstairs almost entirely. Just didn‚Äôt need to. I had work and the sofa and the kitchen, and the days when I came back and barely saw Lily at all were fine by me. I preferred being away from her. Something that kinda broke my heart, if I‚Äôm honest. There were times I wanted to reach out, but looking at her gave me the funniest feeling in my stomach. I didn‚Äôt want to change things. Didn‚Äôt want to get closer. If anything, I wanted to run away. And I don‚Äôt mean that I wanted to flee my life and adult responsibilities in some abstract way. I mean I felt a powerful urge to quite¬†*literally*¬†run away from her. It was horrible feeling that way about my wife, and just trying to understand those emotions was enough to give me a headache most days.¬†

I became real forgetful during this time, and it was a long time before I realised I‚Äôd forgotten to pay for the repairs to the wall. I think it slipped my mind. Emphasis on¬†*think*¬†because I don‚Äôt remember what I have and haven‚Äôt forgotten. I just nailed some plywood over and left it and three months later, one day, out of the blue it occurred to me I should probably have done something more about it. I did find a toolkit in the kitchen that wasn‚Äôt mine. I might have called someone out for a quote. I don‚Äôt know. But once I remembered that I‚Äôd never actually¬†*fixed*¬†the hole, I was filled with this shame and embarrassment and I decided the best thing to do was to face it head on and go apologise to my neighbour.

I never knew a lot about the guy. He was an older man who liked his football, had a nose like a tomato, and spent most nights in the pub. I knew he lived alone though, and when I knocked his door and there was no answer it wasn‚Äôt too strange. At least it didn‚Äôt seem out of the ordinary until I went back inside my house and heard footsteps on the other side of the wall. So I went back and I knocked a couple more times figuring he maybe hadn‚Äôt heard me, but there was still no answer. I found this weird. He didn‚Äôt seem like the kinda guy who‚Äôd avoid a neighbour he didn‚Äôt like. He‚Äôd just open the door and tell you to fuck off.

I went back and looked but couldn‚Äôt see anything through his windows, and all I could see looking through his letterbox was a grey sheet across the opening. When my fingers came away covered in a sticky thread, I had this terrible feeling in my stomach. I couldn‚Äôt have possibly explained how, but I was convinced that Lily had done something. After all, it was him calling the police who‚Äôd gotten her into trouble. But it wasn‚Äôt like I could kick his door down to check, and I wasn‚Äôt gonna go scrambling through any half-open windows.¬†

Fortunately, we shared a fence in the back garden. It was easy enough to jump, and from there I checked the windows on that side of the house. He‚Äôd left the kitchen blinds open, and at first what I saw baffled me. For a moment I wondered if he was decorating because everything inside was covered by a thin translucent sheet. But I only had to pay close attention to realise that didn‚Äôt make sense. When painting a ceiling, you don‚Äôt throw tarps over half-drunk cups of coffee and plates of mouldy food. And the material that covered everything was cloudy and made of thread and obviously some kind of silk. It took a lot of effort to control the urge to just hop the fence back and pretend like I never saw a damn thing. But if he needed some kind of help, then I knew I had to at least try.

I looked briefly at the stoop by the backdoor. There was a lighter on the ground where someone had dropped it. It was strangely conspicuous and made me think that whoever had left it there had done so in a hurry. Didn‚Äôt make sense that someone would drop it there and not notice, not unless they‚Äôd been otherwise occupied. I picked it up and winced when it came from the floor with a sticky tearing sound.

It was covered in barely visible silk threads.

God I wanted that backdoor to be locked. Couldn‚Äôt think of anything worse than having to push ahead, but I tried the handle and it went down. The door popped open with barely any effort and I got a good look at how every last inch of that place was covered in pale cobwebs that got thicker and thicker as my eyes drifted deeper inside the house. I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if they were strong enough to trap a person. Was my neighbour in¬†*there*¬†somewhere? Somebody was. I knew that much from the sounds I‚Äôd heard, but I couldn‚Äôt see him in the kitchen. I wanted to cry out for him, maybe even go marching into the house and look for myself, but the hallway out of the kitchen had been turned into a web-lined tunnel. No straight lines. Just a dark silky womb whose rounded funnel walls fluttered gently in the breeze. I stared intently into that darkness, trying my best to see if there was the shape of a man‚Äôs corpse cocooned somewhere in the pale white silk.¬†

I leaned forward, my head and shoulders just moving past the door frame, when the blackness in the tunnel grew legs. Dark carapace and segmented limbs exploded towards me so fast it was almost in the kitchen before my heart had time to skip a beat. And then it stopped half-way into the room, standing perfectly still and brazen in the fading daylight. A bundle of legs the size of a horse.¬†

A real life monster.¬†

I didn‚Äôt move. Jesus Christ it took me another minute just for my brain to process what I was looking at on a conscious level. My nervous system was quicker, sure. It was like a blanket of disgust and terror was thrown over me. My stomach plunged to the floor. My skin crawled. My heart felt like it was going to explode. But my actual mind was blank. White noise and static. The creature was¬†*huge*. So big its legs could just about fit in the hallway behind it, but in the kitchen with a little more room, those front limbs and mouthy feelers spread out like tendrils and gripped the doorway. It was ready to pounce on whatever had sent disturbances throughout its web.¬†

I‚Äôve read that spiders can be a little like venus fly traps. They won‚Äôt always pounce on a single trigger. They need multiple hits. When I looked down at my feet I saw that I‚Äôd taken just one step inside, but that was all it needed to be alerted. Now it had approached the initial alarm and, half-blind, it waited for another hint of something trapped inside its web.

I had to wonder, would lifting my shoe count?¬†

Did I have a choice?

I couldn‚Äôt stay there. Looking at the damn thing was bringing me closer and closer to full blown panic with every passing second. I had to do something and I had to do it with some semblance of control!¬†

I slid my foot backwards. The spider didn‚Äôt move. As soon as both feet were outside, I let go of the door handle and felt something sticky detach from my palm.

It feels like an exaggeration to say that lightning moves slower. I‚Äôm not sure I have the words to describe how fast it was. I‚Äôm sure most of you have seen a nature documentary with one of those fish or maybe even a trapdoor spider and you thought¬†*oh shit that was quick*¬†but this thing‚Ä¶ Maybe it was just because it was coming right at me. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it except for when videos get edited. All of a sudden it was just there, and before I knew it thick woolly paps were pinning me to the ground and I was looking into a pink slit of a mouth framed by fangs as long as my forearms. They moved independent of each other, and something about the sight of all those wheel-spoke legs and segmented joints clumped together in its thorax sent my mind reeling. I said at the beginning of this that a lifetime of exposure had helped curb my arachnophobia, but there are limits.¬†

I blacked out.¬†

When I woke up it was dark all around me. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but the belly of the beast was my neighbour‚Äôs former living room. It wasn‚Äôt actually pitch black, but it did take a few terrifying minutes for my eyes to adjust well enough just to be able to see my own body stuck and wriggling beneath me. I was wrapped up tight, and if you‚Äôve ever heard the refrain that spider‚Äôs silk is stronger than steel and doubted it, well trust me, it‚Äôs true. A few thin threads doesn‚Äôt give you a proper sense of it. But I was wrapped in what must have been a half-inch of the stuff and I felt like I was wearing ten layers of lycra that was too small. There was a tiny bit of give. Enough to let me move fingers or toes, or even bend a knee just a fraction, but that was it.¬†

It was horrifying. I‚Äôm not exactly claustrophobic either, for what it‚Äôs worth, but given the circumstances I found myself panicking as I tried to get some purchase. I kept thinking if I could get a finger hooked into it then maybe I could start tearing away? I was desperate but the more I fought the more I realised it was hopeless. The silk was elastic and strong and covered in a thick, stodgy glue that only further limited my movement as everything I did spread it around until it was gumming my legs and hands together.

Wasn‚Äôt until exhaustion caught up to me and I was forced to take a short break that I realised I wasn‚Äôt alone.

There was another cocoon beside me.¬†

My neighbour had been a big man in life. Podgy with a large pot belly and a head like a thumb. But in the dim light of that room he looked like a skeleton wrapped in skin that had been found half-decayed in an ancient and forgotten tomb. So thin and desiccated you could hook a finger under the tendons in his neck and jaws. I nearly cried when I realised I‚Äôd risked everything to save a dead man, but that wasn‚Äôt actually true. The error in my thinking became apparent when he opened his eyes and glared at me with pure, unbridled terror. He opened his mouth and I was convinced he was about to scream when instead he coughed and gagged and something wet and brown dribbled out of his mouth.¬†

It flopped down his chin and came to rest on the floor between us. It resembled a hair band encased in bile and vomit, and I was momentarily stumped until I saw a thin brown leg unfurl from the tangled mess.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

My neighbour‚Äôs entire body relaxed, his eyes vacant and confused, as Lily knelt down beside me and stroked my head.¬†

‚ÄúLily you‚Äôve got to get me‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShh,‚Äù she said, pressing a single finger to my lips. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs going to be okay.‚Äù

Behind her, a shadow appeared. It had legs as thick as my wrist, and they reached from the floor to the ceiling.

‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be much longer now,‚Äù she added as the darkness behind her grew. ‚ÄúProbably best to just keep you here.‚Äù

‚ÄúLily what the fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you they‚Äôd get bigger,‚Äù she said, nodding towards the spider my neighbour had just spat onto the floor. ‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt be any real help.‚Äù She touched my neighbour‚Äôs head, but he barely responded. He just gazed vacantly as she rolled him over so that he was facing away from me. ‚ÄúFor such a clever animal,‚Äù she added as she parted his hair, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always curious about just how much you miss.‚Äù¬†

Something was clamped around the back of his head. A throbbing bulb of mottled brown skin and hair. It looked like a spider without legs. A tick, maybe. That‚Äôs what I thought it was until my wife ran a finger playfully along its back and my neighbour let out a gut wrenching squeal of pain. Slowly, the shape seemed to wriggle and writhe and a long thin leg emerged from beneath its body and I realised I was looking at a spider wrapped tight around his skull, its legs buried beneath the skin and muscle of his scalp.¬†

For a moment it playfully curled the leg in the air before returning it to the incision and sliding it back into place, every inch disappearing with a gruesome wet sound. It displaced muscle and hair and when it came to rest, I realised just how misshapen his skull had become from all those legs wrapped tight around his head.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù I gasped.

‚ÄúDo you ever find it weird that you can‚Äôt remember what it looked like? The thing that came running out of her hand?‚Äù she asked before reaching over to stroke my head.¬†

Her hand came away covered in cobwebs.

Something about her touch revolted me. It sent strange shivers coursing through my body. A deep primordial need to get away came over me. That strange revulsion all over again, the same one that had taunted me over and over again over the last few weeks. Without even meaning to I found myself convulsing and panicking, my body trying to thrash violently but with every limb constricted by that silk I could do nothing except writhe around on the floor. I tried with everything I had to move my hands, to get some purchase on the silk and tear away at it to free myself. But it was no use. I could do nothing except glare at my wife and the enormous shadow behind her. The one that towered above us both, its great legs clustering around the floor and ceiling.¬†

At some point I grabbed onto my trousers and clenched my fist and felt something small and hard.¬†

The lighter.¬†

I knew there was great risk in using it, but I had no choice. I managed to worm my hand into my pocket and find it with my fumbling fingers. My wife seemed oddly aware of what I was doing, and she seemed to tilt her head like a curious dog as I clenched my fist around the small object and used every ounce of willpower I had left to fight the violent seizures that racked my body and thumbed the trigger.¬†

The web went up in flames immediately. It must have been the glue, but the flames exploded across the silk like they‚Äôd been soaked in kerosene. Before I even realised that it had weakened enough for me to free one arm, the tongues of fire were already spreading across the floor where they found my poor neighbour.¬†

The burning sensation that crawled across my legs and chest hurt like nothing I could imagine, but I was finally free. I rolled over and began to push myself up, already desperately patting at my body to try and put out the flames. When I looked around me, my wife and the shape that followed her were gone. For a moment I considered helping my neighbour, but his body thrashed too violently and although his eyes were wide open, spiders were pouring from his mouth and I could not summon the courage to take another step towards him. All I could think of was escape.

The house was going up like a tinderbox. It wasn‚Äôt far to the kitchen, but the fire had already beat me there. Smoke billowed upwards and, trapped by the ceiling, started to fill the air with choking soot. The only escape was the backdoor, and I stumbled towards it but was stopped at the last moment by the sight of my wife standing there.

‚ÄúYou really are such a fascinating spec‚Äì‚Äù

I barrelled past her, but to my surprise she offered no resistance. I merely emerged into the open air, my lungs gasping desperately for clean air as I collapsed onto long unkempt grass. I looked over my shoulder and saw orange tongues of fire were already leaping out of the windows on the upper floor. Left uncontrolled, the fire would rage and consume the entire row of terrace houses. I felt a moment of remorse, but there were already sirens in the distance so I knew someone had noticed and done the right thing.¬†

But it wasn‚Äôt over.¬†

Lily was sitting on the fence. I don‚Äôt know how she got there, but she looked completely undisturbed.

‚ÄúI never once imagined that when that wind blew me into your home, I‚Äôd find such an interesting pair of people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat a fun mind to sink my legs into. I really had no idea what I was going to find.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet her go!‚Äù I gasped.

‚ÄúI have,‚Äù she said with a shrug. ‚ÄúI did, months ago as a matter of fact. There were some incompatibilities and it just made sense to move homes.‚Äù She pointed at me and smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve enjoyed living inside your head quite a bit.‚Äù

Struggling to make sense of her words, but still somehow aware of their terrifying implications, I placed one hand on the back of my head and felt it. Felt¬†*her*. The mere touch was enough to fill my mouth with a coppery taste, while my vision blurred at the edges. Something beneath my skin shifted and I felt a terrible pressure behind my eyes. I had to get rid of her, and I only knew of one weakness.¬†

‚ÄúOh well,‚Äù she said as she watched me fumble desperately for the lighter. ‚ÄúNot every relationship has to last forever to be meaningful.‚Äù

I lit my hair on fire.¬†

My last memories were of heat and a sudden release of pressure. I couldn‚Äôt possibly describe it to you. Not really. Something slid out of my skull and Lily waved at me from the fence before she seemed to blink out of existence and then‚Ä¶ nothing. Not even darkness. Just total absence.

I wouldn‚Äôt regain a sense of self until the hospital several weeks later.¬†

There was nothing left of either house, but they did manage to control the fire before it spread to the others. I‚Äôm sure there was still some damage, and to this day I feel guilty about it. I think I was charged with arson. Maybe more. I have vague memories of being wheeled into a courtroom. The doctors have agonised over me for a long time, and one mentioned amateur trepanation. He said I must have practiced it on my wife, at least based on the body they found in my neighbour‚Äôs house. But I can‚Äôt really be sure of anything. I am forever dipping in and out of reality. Writing this down has been‚Ä¶ difficult. I‚Äôm not¬†*entirely*¬†aware where I am right now. One doctor told me I might make some kind of recovery, if it was just normal brain damage. But he‚Äôd never seen anything like it, so he couldn‚Äôt be sure.

Feels like it‚Äôs a different doctor every time I see them. Then again, I don‚Äôt always recognise myself when I look in the mirror. Of course that could just be the burns, but I reckon even then I still look a fair bit older than I should.¬†

There is one orderlie who‚Äôs stuck around long enough to get to know me. He knows me by name. Smiles a lot when he sees me. Talks to me about all sorts of things. He seems genuinely interested in me and what I remember. I called him in once to get rid of a spider that had spun a web on the window outside and he did so with a warm smile. I told him I was deathly afraid of them, and he said he already knew that, but I shouldn‚Äôt worry because he was going to keep an eye on me and make sure nothing bad happened. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs around. Ever since he‚Äôs started working here I haven‚Äôt seen many of the nasty little things hanging around my room.

I guess he‚Äôs not that bothered by them, at least not if the cobwebs in his hair are anything to go by.",22,1748011565.0,nosleep,0,0.97,False

Throwaway account because my life is officially a dumpster fire and I can't let anyone I know see this mess.

So here I am, 45 years old, writing this from my ex-husband's basement at 2 AM because I literally have nowhere else to go. The concrete floor is cold against my feet and I can hear him upstairs watching late night TV, probably wondering how the hell we got here. Spoiler alert: it's entirely my fault.

Back in 2007, my marriage was comfortable but boring. My husband worked his construction job, came home covered in dust, and we'd eat dinner while talking about our son's grades and weekend plans. Our kid was a junior in high school, dreaming about college, and we'd been saving since he was born. Not rich people money, but we had about $80,000 tucked away in his college fund. I was proud of that number.

Then I met him at a coffee shop downtown. Designer suit, perfect smile, talking loudly on his phone about ""moving millions"" and ""closing deals."" When he asked for my number, I felt alive for the first time in years. My husband noticed me getting dressed up more, buying new clothes, but I told him I was just feeling better about myself.

The finance guy made me feel like I was special. He'd take me to expensive restaurants where the wine cost more than our grocery budget. He talked about his penthouse, his sports car, his connections on Wall Street. And like an absolute fool, I believed every word.

""You deserve better than this small-town life,"" he'd whisper during our hotel meetings. ""I could give you everything you've ever wanted.""

When he told me about this ""guaranteed investment opportunity"" that would triple our money in six months, I saw dollar signs. Our son could go to any college he wanted. We could pay off the house. I could leave my boring marriage and start over with someone who actually appreciated me.

I transferred the entire college fund without telling my husband. Every penny our kid had counted on.

September 2008 hit like a freight train. The finance guy stopped returning my calls. His ""investment firm"" was just a fancy office he'd rented for show. The stock market crashed, my husband found out about the affair and the missing money on the same day, and our world fell apart in about six hours.

My son came home from school that day excited about college brochures he'd picked up from the guidance counselor. The look on his face when we told him the money was gone still haunts me. He didn't yell or cry. He just went to his room and closed the door.

""How could you do this to us?"" my husband asked, and I had no answer. I'd gambled away our son's future for a fantasy.

The divorce was brutal. My husband got the house because I'd destroyed our finances. Our son barely spoke to me. I moved into a tiny apartment and watched my family rebuild their lives without me.

My son worked two jobs through high school and community college. He got scholarships, took out loans, and somehow made it work. He graduated last year with a degree in engineering, no thanks to me. My ex-husband remarried a woman who actually showed up for our son's graduation. I watched from the back row.

Now I'm back here because I lost my job and can't make rent. My ex-husband, the man I cheated on and financially destroyed, offered me his basement until I get back on my feet. Our son lives across the country and calls his dad every week. He sent me a birthday card this year, which felt like a miracle.

I know I messed up everything. I chose a lying stranger over my family. I stole my child's future for a midlife crisis fantasy. But I'm trying to make amends. I've been going to therapy, working on myself, and hoping that someday my son might forgive me.

My ex-husband says I need to stop wallowing and figure out how to actually help our son pay off his student loans if I want any chance at redemption. He's not wrong.

Would love to know if anyone has any tips or recipes for a sulphite-free diet?

I've been given a list of foods to avoid, but my biggest issue is that Google seems to say everything *may* have sulphur in it, so I don't know what to eat. My rule of thumb so far is to just avoid things that are not fresh or preserved, but there are still questions around things like coffee, eggs, rice, etc. where Google says all of these may contain sulphur to an extent (even if it's the smell of rice/coffee) so I'm not sure if it's okay to eat. 

Hoping that Reddit will come through with some guilt-free lunch and dinner choices!

I know how to make marinade.,"I like making stuff from scratch as much as I can. I'm no master chef, but when I have the time, I like to put as much effort in as possible.

My husband's family isn't like this at all. They think a boxed cake mix with nuts sprinkled on is revolutionary.

Our first Christmas together as a married couple, I went ALL out and made a HUGE Italian dinner. I made so many dishes. One that I was especially proud of was a lemon tart I made. All from scratch. Crust and all. I really wanted my husband to try this. 

When we first started planning, his mommy texted him, and I thought she was asking what to bring. I told him to tell her not to bring anything. (It was my first holiday doing the cooking, and I wanted it to be special and every dish to be Italian. I wanted to be proud of myself and impress people who a lot of times shit on everything I do.)

He told me he isn't going to tell her not to bring anything because she wants to. I mean, I'm the asshole of course, but maybe you should care more about making your wife happy than Mommy. After this evolved into a bit of an argument, I told him some things she could bring since that's what he wanted me to do since she was asking.

When he messaged her back, it turns out she wasn't asking what she could bring she was just going to bring what she wanted to bring. I don't remember what happened after this if we argued or what, but I was not happy at all.

My worst fear was that she would bring a dessert, and my husband would eat hers and not mine. Well, maybe I'm just a psychic genius, or maybe I just know their MO. This is exactly why I didn‚Äôt want them to bring anything.

There was some bs that went on, mil ‚Äúlooking‚Äù around our house trying to ‚Äúfind a bathroom.‚Äù
Complaining and making us put certain food back in the fridge because we did too much (Charcuterie board). All of this wasn't just mil.

Them letting one of the very young grandchildren eat whole grapes when he is far too young.

I couldn't hear anyone. All the dogs in the neighborhood were barking for some reason. Sports was on the TV everyone was talking. MIL was the hardest to hear, so she probably thinks I was just being a jerk to her, but I genuinely couldn't hear her.

Well, anyway, everyone liked my food, and then dessert got put out.

My husband and I together made Tiramisu, which I knew he wouldn't eat because he hates coffee.

He didn't eat the lemon tart, though, but he sure ate a metric ton of mommies boxed cake mix. Wow, it has nuts on top, 5 michelin stars. I thought you didn't like nuts, dear husband? I guess when it's your mommies box and nuts, you can't get enough. (Wow, I'm sick)

Well, anyway, I was just really hurt by this. Even more for the fact that I left my tart in the fridge for him to maybe eat sometime, which of course he didn't. Mommy made sure to leave several slices of cake for him. He ate it all.

Well if I ever cook a holiday dinner again I'm not making dessert. If anyone asks why fuck I didn‚Äôt I'll give them an earful.

 Don't bring your shit dessert to my house next time I'll roast you and tell you that your son has the palate of a 5 year old.

The End

I keep hearing that I'll get a recipe book with all the recipes DH loves in them that they make. It's a cute, lovely idea before you learn that you despise these people. 

Cause yes I need a recipe book full of recipes such as 

Queso - heat velveeta. Serve.

Salmon Patties -
Ingredients 
1 can of Salmon
Some breadcrumbs
Mix. Cook. Enjoy
(This one is for real! My husband told me that's exactly how his mom does it.)
Michelin stars cant even quantify the delectiblity of this flavorless wonder.

Oh and these fucking people call salsa SAUCE.
MIL also fancies herself an enchilada master.
(What's that family guy bit with white women talking about TacKos on a corn tortiLas (tortillas)? Those are the in-laws)

GMIL called me one day to tell me about a recipe she thought of to cook for her grandson. Acted like it was the discovery of spices from the silk road or noodles from China or tomatoes for the Western hemisphere.
It was fucking her simple ass version of meat and cheese in a tortilla. Wow cause I didn't know you could put 2 things in between a type for bread.

MIL uses a certain store bought marinade to make chicken fajitas. That's what my husband is used to I've used it for a while now.

I did it a few days ago and while it was cooking in the pan I just said out loud ‚ÄúWhat the fuck am I doing?‚Äù 

I don't need to be told how to cook from people's who don't know how, especially when their version is telling me to buy some bs marinade. 
I know how to make marinade.

So I'm not buying anymore of it. If he wants it, Mommy can make it.


Another thing I just thought of was when I was supposed to make a certain food, I don't remember what. I was out of the room busy, and I heard my husband telling me from the door that we don't have a seasoning packet for it, so he has to go to the store.

 What? A seasoning packet? I mean, does he not see the rows, racks, and stacks of spices! You do know they can be mixed together, right? I didn't pay all that money, so I can make good homemade spice mixes to go spend 2 bucks on a crappy spice mix for one meal.

Oh and to add insult to injury husband likes those basic bitch recipes more than if I bust my ass making something wonderful tasting from scratch and possibly try to get a little gourmet.

Maybe mommies bland ass simple recipe book is needed.

¬†

I‚Äôm still working as an associate attorney for Mitchell & Mitchell, and have been practicing almost 4 years now doing exclusively criminal work.

I am really excited to carry on the tradition of helping this community of wonderful Redditors by giving information‚Ä¶and I‚Äôll answer what questions I can! I believe that I can be a voice for your questions and concerns, as well as the voice and contact person for my LOCAL firm here in Middle Tennessee.

¬†

In my 2024 post, I mentioned that I am a long-time attendee of Bonnaroo. This will be my 13th consecutive year! As a somewhat newly licensed attorney, I can answer most of your questions, and if I cannot I have been given explicit permission from the managing partner of my firm to relay questions that I am unsure of directly to him and give you the best and most accurate information. Although I am new as an attorney (4 years officially last month), I‚Äôm in an extremely unique learning and working situation, as my supervising attorney, Jack Mitchell, has been practicing locally in criminal defense for over 30 years. That‚Äôs in addition to having a great working relationship with the district attorney assigned to Bonnaroo cases.

¬†

I wanted to continue the tradition of this post because I do believe that people on this sub get some good benefit from it and share details of the process for handling charges that can change from year to year. This is a place to ask questions you may have, and I will try to answer everything I can (and if not, I will do my best to get the answer for you). As someone who loves attending Bonnaroo and being part of the community there, I hope you don‚Äôt need this information, but it is here in case you do.

¬†

The current elected District Attorney brought changes to the way criminal charges resulting from the festival were handled. In years past, criminal citations and charges were treated differently during Bonnaroo. Those who caught charges (defendants) were sent a letter from the District Attorney‚Äôs Office and the Court Clerk indicating that with the payment of a fine, the charges would be dismissed or retired after a certain period of time. The more serous the offense, the larger the fine assessed.

¬†

The last several years, criminal charges resulting from Bonnaroo were supposed to be treated the same as every other crime in Coffee County. However, what we found is that the process for festival offenses is still much different than the process used the rest of the year, and we expect more of the same this year.

¬†

What does this mean for you? If you are arrested or cited for any criminal offense while you are in Coffee County for Bonnaroo, you will have to make regular court appearances (REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE CITING OFFICER TELLS YOU) or have a licensed attorney appear on your behalf, and you will be prosecuted through the justice system. It‚Äôs annoying, for sure, but if you don‚Äôt show, and don‚Äôt have permission to not appear, the penalties could increase.

¬†

Probably the best advice we could give you when dealing with law enforcement is to exercise your right to remain silent. Along with this, you should not willingly consent to the search of your person, bags, vehicle, or campsite (other than when you enter the tollbooths). An officer may go ahead and search anyway, but giving consent immediately removes any chance of suppressing the contraband they find.

¬†

We understand that sometimes unfortunate things happen, and at Bonnaroo it is usually a case of bad luck and timing rather than bad people or actions. If you find yourself in this situation and need the assistance of an attorney, you can contact us through Reddit, at (615) 896-4211, [emily@mitchellattorneys.com](mailto:emily@mitchellattorneys.com), or through our website at¬†mitchellattorneys.com. We can work with you on fees and will try to minimize travel and costs for out of state clients.

¬†

The major benefit of retaining an attorney with knowledge of the system is most of the leg work and negotiation can be done prior to the first time you are required to be in court. For most of our clients in past years, they were only required to make one court appearance, and for others (depending on the charges and criminal history) we were able to completely avoid the need for their appearance in court. Almost everyone we represented in past years was able to keep the conviction off their record and have their charges expunged.

¬†

Every situation is different, but our knowledge of the local judicial system and professional relationship with the District Attorney‚Äôs office will help ensure the most favorable result for your individual case.¬†¬†I will be on the farm experiencing the festival as always, and I‚Äôll have koozies and business cards with me, lol! Enjoy your time in Middle Tennessee and at Roo. Also, look for our sign prior to entering and, like the sign says, take a picture JUST IN CASE.

¬†

\*NEW INFO FOR THIS YEAR (2025)\*¬†

Last year a number of personal vehicles were seized during police shakedowns. This is just an FYI that if you have the unfortunate interaction with law enforcement, there is a potential for them to seize your car. When this happens, you will have to essentially buy your car back from them. This is not the same for rental cars, as they have to return the rental back to the company it came from.

¬†

\*\*TLDR:\*\* while this whole post is informative, basically this is about Coffee County‚Äôs Bonnaroo citation procedures and helpful information.

**My Neighbor Kept Stealing from My Garage ‚Äî So I Left Him a Surprise He‚Äôd Never Forget**

¬†

Back when I bought this house, I had no idea I was moving in next to a man-child with the impulse control of a raccoon on Red Bull. Let‚Äôs call him Ricky.

Ricky had the exact kind of energy that screamed ‚Äúmultiple warrants and one very avoidable court date.‚Äù Tattoos that looked like they‚Äôd been drawn by a Sharpie-wielding toddler. A pit bull that barked at clouds. A chain-smoker laugh. And that constant sweaty aura of a guy who might ask you for a ride to ‚Äúgo pick something up‚Äù ‚Äî which, you know, could mean anything.

I tried to be neighborly. I really did. First winter, I helped him dig his car out of a snowbank. He asked to borrow a shovel. Then a rake. Then a ladder. All came back with something mysteriously broken or missing. He once offered me some ‚Äúhomebrew‚Äù from his garage setup. It came in a repurposed Mountain Dew bottle and smelled like regret. I declined.

Things got sketchier when his buddy Joey started coming around. Joey looked like he‚Äôd just walked off the set of a failed reality show ‚Äî long greasy ponytail, scuffed leather jacket, and this twitchy paranoia like he owed someone money right now. He and Ricky were inseparable. And soon after Joey started showing up, things in my garage started vanishing.

At first, I thought I was just being forgetful. A flashlight missing here, a pack of smokes gone, maybe I drank that soda and forgot. But then a bottle of bourbon disappeared. Then some rum. Then my lock looked‚Ä¶off.

I wasn‚Äôt going to let this slide.

So, I decided to give Ricky and Joey a gift.

I took an old bottle of gin ‚Äî nasty stuff I‚Äôd gotten in a Christmas gift basket years ago ‚Äî and emptied it. Then I refilled it with antifreeze, added a splash of water, and tossed in some blue food coloring to make it look convincing. Gave it a good shake, wiped the bottle clean, and placed it back on the shelf in my garage, front and center.

Two nights later, bingo.

I woke up to the garage door cracked open and the bottle gone. Lock busted. Classic Ricky.

The next morning? Ambulance outside Ricky‚Äôs house. Lights flashing. EMTs rushing in. I made a coffee and sat on the porch like it was Sunday brunch.

Turns out, our genius duo helped themselves to my ‚Äúspecial‚Äù gin. Both ended up in the ER, violently ill. Ricky apparently puked so hard his dog started howling. Joey? Well, Joey got it worse ‚Äî kidney failure. Spent three days in the hospital and had to start dialysis.

And here‚Äôs the kicker.

They tried to sue me.

After breaking into my property, stealing my booze, and poisoning themselves on it ‚Äî they had the audacity to claim I‚Äôd ‚Äúmaliciously endangered them.‚Äù

Ricky even came to my door wearing a neck brace, looking like he was auditioning for a low-budget courtroom drama.

‚ÄúYo man,‚Äù he said, leaning on the doorframe like we were pals. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seriously not gonna settle? Joey‚Äôs not doing good, man. He might need a transplant.‚Äù

I stared at him. ‚ÄúYou stole from me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt locked, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was locked,‚Äù I said flatly.

He shrugged like that somehow made me the bad guy. ‚ÄúMan, we just wanted a drink. You didn‚Äôt have to try and kill us.‚Äù

I closed the door in his face.

Court day rolled around and their lawyer ‚Äî who honestly looked like he‚Äôd been paid in scratch-off tickets ‚Äî tried to claim reckless endangerment, said I‚Äôd booby-trapped my own house. My lawyer came armed with photos of the busted lock, security cam timestamps, and even local ordinances on trespassing and theft.

The judge didn‚Äôt waste time.

Case dismissed.

Even raised an eyebrow at Ricky and told him he should count himself lucky I hadn‚Äôt pressed charges.

I could‚Äôve countersued. Easily. My lawyer even encouraged it ‚Äî lost wages, emotional distress, property damage, whatever. But I passed. I figured the antifreeze did enough damage on its own ‚Äî and not just to their kidneys.

I heard Ricky had to sell his truck to cover legal fees. Joey‚Äôs medical bills wiped out whatever savings he might‚Äôve had. And after the court loss, both of them avoided me like the plague. Ricky moved out six months later. I think he skipped on his lease, because a property manager came around looking very irritated. Last I heard, he ended up in Arizona. Or maybe Vegas. Doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äî they‚Äôre used to his type.

I did see Joey once downtown, though. He looked rough. That healthy criminal glow had faded. He looked 20 years older. No ponytail. No jacket. Just an empty stare.

His left arm itched fiercely, the sensation crawling through his veins like embers.

He needed answers. Grabbing his coat, he decided to track down John, the gas station owner. The rain had stopped, but the air hung heavy and cold, wrapping him in an icy grip. His footsteps rang out in the empty streets.Inside the gas station, John hunched behind the counter, nursing a coffee. He looked up, startled. ‚ÄúMike? What‚Äôs got you out this late?‚ÄùMike leaned in. ‚ÄúJohn, you saw something weird, didn‚Äôt you? Tell me.‚ÄùJohn set his mug down, casting a wary glance around before lowering his voice. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt laugh this off, Mike.

John frowned. ‚ÄúYeah. It was holding something‚Äîlooked like a toy bear.‚Äù

The words hit like a punch. Mike‚Äôs fists clenched. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure it was a bear?‚Äù‚ÄúDead sure,‚Äù John said. ‚ÄúIt looped the street, then poof‚Äîgone. Scared me stiff.

The truth felt closer, but so did the fear.Back at the house, he studied the bear‚Äôs scorched mark again. Up close, it looked like a handprint branded into the fur. A shiver ran through him.

He grabbed a dusty book on the supernatural from the shelf and pored over it. Hours ticked by, his eyes burning, but nothing fit. Then, a faint tap-tap-tap‚Äîlike knuckles on wood‚Äîcut through the silence.

He froze, turning toward the door. The hallway yawned black and empty. Edging closer, he yanked it open. Nothing but frigid air rushed in. As he moved to shut it, a scrap of paper caught his eye on the floor: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt escape.‚Äù

His hands shook as he snatched it up. Sweat plastered his shirt to his back. Slamming the door, he tossed the note onto the table and slumped into a chair, mind racing.

He was caught in something dark and spiraling, with no clue where it‚Äôd drag him. The bear, the photo, John‚Äôs shadow‚Äîthey were pieces of a puzzle he couldn‚Äôt solve. But he‚Äôd find the truth, even if it killed him.",1,1748010869.0,u_Bear_AI,0,1.0,False
1ktl3ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1ktl3ii/can_overbest_ob7006_pitcher_water_filter_truly/,Can Overbest OB7006 Pitcher Water Filter Truly Elevate Your Drinking Experience Review?,"The **Overbest OB7006 NSF Certified Pitcher Water Filter** has become an integral part of my daily hydration ritual, and I've had the opportunity to test it rigorously over the past month. This pitcher replacement filter is tailored specifically for several Brita models, including the Brita Classic 35557, and impressed me with its NSF certifications, ease of setup, and water filtration efficiency. Even with its strengths, there are a few considerations to note for potential buyers.

**Functional Design and Compatibility**

I appreciated how well this filter fits into my older Brita Grand pitcher and generates no leaks during use. The design combines precision manufacturing techniques to ensure proper installation and smooth water flow. Other compatible models listed include Brita‚Äôs Metro, Space Saver, Marina, and more. Seeing that it‚Äôs made thoughtfully to cover multiple generations of pitchers adds to its appeal, especially if you‚Äôre like me, holding onto trusty products from years ago.

**Efficiency Through Multi-Stage Filtration**

One standout feature is its multi-stage filtration system. By employing natural coconut shell activated carbon and high-quality ion exchange resin, it guarantees water free from chlorine, taste issues, and that questionable ‚Äútap water‚Äù odor. I‚Äôve noticed an instant difference in taste, proving this isn‚Äôt just your run-of-the-mill filter. 

**[Check Overbest OB7006 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b08fsplqlz/)**

What surprised me was the balance it strikes - the water remains flavorful without that sterile aftertaste some filters leave, which feels like a win for weekday coffee and weekend soups.

**Positives**

- NSF 42 certification effectively removes 93.9% of chlorine.
- Durable materials: BPA-free and lead-free composition ensures peace of mind.
- Fast and smooth water flow without compromising filtration quality.  

**Areas of Concern**

- Though it's certified NSF 42 and NSF 372, it doesn't filter fluoride, which might be an issue if you‚Äôre specifically looking for fluoride removal.
- The filter requires overnight soaking for optimal functionality, which might delay initial use.
- Some users reported slight variations in filter lifespan depending on local water conditions, which makes estimating replacements tricky.

**Targeted Longevity**

Replacing it every two months or after 60 gallons is recommended ‚Äì though as a daily tea enthusiast, I feel the two-month rotation works better for me to ensure consistent quality. It‚Äôs helpful the instructions advised pre-soaking the filter for five minutes. While minor, forgetting this step results in frustrating air bubbles that disrupt water flow, something I wish wasn‚Äôt as critical in the setup.

**Product Contenders**

Compared to conventional Brita filters or systems like PUR‚Äôs faucet mounts, the Overbest option shakes things up, leaning towards simplicity and adaptability. Where Brita excels with streamlined pitcher filters exclusively designed for its models, Overbest offers cheaper access at the same standard. Conversely, PUR filters, while robust, favor heavier filtration but lack seamless pitcher compatibility - meaning Overbest stays in its lane elegantly.

**Affordable Quality**

Taking into account its cost-effectiveness, this pitcher water filter shines as a practical solution to daily kitchen needs. It provides reliable multi-stage filtration with a considerate price-to-quality ratio, which feels fairly justified given its certifications and results. While I wouldn't label it premium, the lack of compromise shows good value placement in comparison to name-brand filters.

1ktl2jr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1ktl2jr/mirror_ritual/,Mirror Ritual,"2025 May 23: Dear Diary,

Last night I drank about ten cups of water while looking at myself in the break room mirror. Lately I have been feeling quite down about the need to search for a better job. I think I might look for something in publishing since I technically have a bit of experience. Despite feeling down, looking at myself in the mirror was a nice moment.  
  
As a child I was afraid of mirrors. I used to believe Bloody Mary would come out of them and stab me if I looked into one for too long. After I stopped believing in such nonsense, I started to believe I was hideous. In hindsight the aversion to my reflection was undoubtedly gender dysphoria. I could not handle looking too masculine.  
  
Currently I look more androgynous. I love my androgyny. Gazing upon my long hair in the mirror was wonderful. Drinking water while I looked back at myself enhanced the experience. I repeated positive affirmations to myself. When I stared for longer I could see my reflection start to shift. My eyes would play tricks on me and change the shape of my face until I blinked or looked at the new shape.  
  
I need to look into the mirror more often. Repeating positive affirmations in the mirror and meditating on Aum are the two things that make me feel rejuvenated in a short amount of time. Caffeine is wonderful too, but I worry about my throat if I continue to take large amounts of caffeine. I would like to go back to only one cup of coffee a day, but as long as I am working at my current job I will require Vivarin to talk to people. Maybe more mirror rituals will help though.

Sincerely,

I developed feelings for a colleague at work. He was introverted and seemed kind, which drew me in. As we got closer, I fell in love, but he turned emotionally abusive, body-shaming me, questioning my character for having male friends, and demanding access to my private chats. After we got physically intimate, he told me all my male friends wanted to sleep with me and imposed a two-month no-contact rule. He later reactivated my Instagram without permission and went through old chats. Now, he flirts with other women at work, and I feel stuck, hurt, and emotionally drained every day I have to see him flirting with another woman, having coffee together at the canteen, and he does that on purpose, and I feel rage inside and helplessness that I offered him the world and he chose to leave something real.

I have projects and ambitions, but I'm so tired, it's getting in the way. If I can, I take a nap everyday. If there isn't something to wake me up (I'm not talking about an alarm but like someone, or somethng scheduled) i'll sleep for up to 3 hours. If I can't nap, I'm absolutely ready for bed at 8, but I resist because I can't have my day be nothing more than work. 

Here is what I believe in my life could have an impact in my tiredness :   
\- I fall asleep around midnight, wake up at 7 am  
\- I mostly eat homecooked food, I have to admit I don't eat vegetables in every meals, but I do my best to include them ; might be eating not enough protein tho   
\- I bicycle to work, for about an hour in total each day   
\- I go to the gym for an hour twice a week   
\- I drink between 0 and 4 coffees everyday, depends on the mood, never more than 4 tho   
\- I wake up tired most of the time   
\- I grind my teeth during my sleep   
\- I have migraines pretty often (around 15 days out of a month)  
\- I stress a lot/have intense emotions due to PTSD/BPD but I'm getting better   
\- I hate my job   
\- I try not to use my phone around sleep time, I let go of screens one hour before bed and read a bit to fall asleep  
\- I drink alcohol like once or twice a week. I get tipsy, even tho i don't drink heavily

The employer should have to pay the tax so that places start banning tips. Your welcome American consumer.,"Since we like to use taxes as an incentive structure and every positive IQ person recognizes that tips are one of the most obnoxious ways of paying people that has a built in social awkwardness and time cost on every interaction, why not have the employer foot the bill on a high tip tax? For example let's say you tip 10 dollars to your blue haired barista at one of those non-AC controlled, over priced local college coffee shops that is a good argument for why chains are superior to local dining in every way. The coffee shop, rather than the barista would be on the hook for paying 9 dollars to the government. 

This would incentivize basically every employer in America to ban tips. But it would also appeal to the ""but I did eat breakfast"" idiot Americans politically because on the surface it's attacking the employers. And since every boomer congressmen enjoys masturnbating to the thought of giving a generous tip to their cute girl next door waiter, they might be fooled into thinking they can still do that.

1ktl0a4,https://i.redd.it/6fxbyxzykj2f1.png,The Box That Carried What My Heart Could Not,"# There are moments in life when silence is louder than screams.

When the heart whispers what the mouth cannot say. That day, I packed a box. A plain, brown box. But inside it, I placed everything my heart could no longer hold.

It started with a drawer. A small one. The one where she used to keep her hair clips, her tiny earrings, and that perfume she wore on the day we argued the most.

# I opened it like I was opening an old wound. Slowly. Carefully. Afraid of what might bleed.

I didn‚Äôt cry. Not at first. I just stared. Everything looked normal. Ordinary. But it wasn‚Äôt. Every item was a voice. A memory. A breath I once took, now returned with a sting.

**I took a deep breath and began.**

The earrings went in first. Quiet. Polite. As if they knew their time had passed. Then the scarf. The one I bought in winter, hoping it would keep her warm. It never did. Not really.

Then came the lipstick, and a pair of sunglasses. The birthday card I gave her that she never read properly. A photo. A letter. A necklace I once called beautiful not because of its design, but because it touched her skin.

I added the European heels I bought her in Paris, the [dress](https://shopysquares.com/collections/women-clothes) I saved for months to buy, the makeup kit she said she couldn‚Äôt live without. I placed her handbags ‚Äî all six ‚Äî in the box with gentle defiance, as though placing each one was a quiet goodbye to the sacrifices I made to bring them into her life.

But then I paused ‚Äî staring at these things I once gifted with love.  
Could someone else wear these shoes now, walk in them with dignity?  
Could a stranger apply that lipstick without tasting the bitterness left behind?

No. They were soaked not just with perfume, but with the residue of disdain, manipulation, and silent betrayals.  
They reeked not of beauty ‚Äî but of cold ambition wrapped in charm.

These were not things to donate.  
These were remnants of a battle fought in silence.  
They had no place in another life, another home.

Each piece whispered back at me:

>

As I packed, I realized something:

>

Each item had its own weight. Not in grams, but in grief. Not in volume, but in value.

The hardest piece was the white blouse. The one she wore the first time she said, ""I love you.""

I held it like a relic. Folded it like a prayer.  
And placed it in the box like a memory too sacred to burn.

Next, I found a small note. Her handwriting. Simple, rushed, imperfect ‚Äî but it stopped my hand for a moment. I read the first word. That was enough. I didn‚Äôt need the rest. I folded it, placed it under the scarf, and closed the box.

How many times had I denied myself things just to afford her one more gift, one more smile that never lasted?  
How often did I walk past something I wanted, only to return with something she liked more?

**I gave her parts of my life to decorate hers.**  
**Now I was giving those parts away to reclaim mine.**

And so, I made the choice ‚Äî not to give them to charity,  
but to the only place they belonged: **the trash.**

Because the box did not hold reusable joy ‚Äî it held grief soaked into silk, leather lined with resentment, and shadows stitched into every seam.

To the trash, then ‚Äî not out of anger,  
but because some things are too tainted to be re-loved.

I drove. No destination. Just movement. As if miles could measure detachment. The car moved, but my thoughts didn‚Äôt. I remembered the laughter, the silence, the nights of soft breathing and the mornings of cold coffee and colder shoulders.

Eventually, I stopped the car beside a dumpster.  
No donation bin this time.  
No trees to shield it.  
Just a steel box ‚Äî like the one I carried ‚Äî waiting.

I stepped out, holding the box like something both sacred and toxic.  
Not because I still loved her. But because I once did.  
And that mattered.

**I whispered, ""Thank you."" Not to her. But to the box. For carrying what my heart could not.**

I placed it inside.  
Closed the lid.  
And walked away.

Not lighter. Not free.  
But honest.

Because healing is not forgetting.  
It‚Äôs remembering without the pain.  
And letting go without the need to hold again.

They say a man shouldn't hold on to things.  
But we do. In drawers. In boxes. In the corners of our minds where no one looks.

We carry pain in silence.  
We carry memories like soft glass ‚Äî fragile, dangerous, and beautiful.

That day, the trash carried it all.  
The love. The loss. The betrayal too deep for words.

And maybe that‚Äôs what freedom is:  
Not forgetting, but no longer needing to remember every day.

Maybe one day, someone will ask where it all went.  
And I will simply say:

>

Because I was saving something more valuable ‚Äî  
**my dignity, my humanity, my peace.**  
And I swear to myself:  
**I will never walk that path again.**

I‚Äôve been in very abusive relationship before this was some years back however, in the present I‚Äôm married. I know there are red flags and I do have something in place futuristically but that will take time as I need to gather my finances first.


My spouse lies to me comfortably regularly about things that don‚Äôt even make sense. Why he‚Äôs lying for example I‚Äôll ask if he ate that day he‚Äôll tell me yeah but I only had a coffee and some water and some mints this morning. I said that‚Äôs not good. You need to make sure you‚Äôre fueling your body meanwhile, I know that he stopped at a fast food restaurant because we have the truck GPS on our phones and I see the receipts. The problem isn‚Äôt the food. It‚Äôs the principal why are you lying to me about something so small?

I‚Äôve had heart-to-heart with him many times to ask if he struggles with food or has some sensitivity to it as I myself have struggled with eating disorders throughout my life and I want to be there for him and let him know it‚Äôs OK I‚Äôm not here to judge you You can be open with me, but that‚Äôs not the problem. The problem is he has a habit of lying and will go to great lengths to create a scenario that didn‚Äôt happen despite me having evidence that it happened and then once I show him the evidence he‚Äôs like OK I‚Äôll be open with you about it moving forward. However, of course it has continued despite the countless heart-to-heart conversations I‚Äôve had with him.

There‚Äôs so much that I can talk about and I know this may seem silly but for me, your spouse deserves complete honesty. Why are you so comfortable lying to me? That shows a lack of respect and an insult to my intelligence. It‚Äôs not only about the food. There are multiple things bigger things that he‚Äôs lied about to keep me under a false pretense Leaving me to be forced to accept a lifestyle that I didn‚Äôt get the choice to be or not be OK with.

This is made me lose respect for him. I see him differently and I don‚Äôt want to be touched by him sexually and I sure don‚Äôt wanna have kids by him. If you can‚Äôt even be honest about what you‚Äôve done despite me having the physical receipts and you‚Äôre trying to prove that it was Another day, etc. then why should I trust you with bigger things? 

Not to mention we‚Äôve gotten in argument before, and he yelled at me, grabbed my wrist and was pushing me back towards the bed and I was trying to push against him so I wouldn‚Äôt fall on the bed.

I have a few questions, and so if you would be so kind to indulge, much appreciated!

1. Since I now have a Marcus savings account up and running, will they send me monthly statements so I can keep up on the interest it is earning? I know its available on the app but I try to organize my files really well so I like paper copies of everything.
2. Since I am now a Marcus member, what about some Marcus swag? I know I'd love a water bottle, perhaps a keychain, sweat band, pen, coffee mugs, etc.? Lots of banks give this stuff out for free, what about Marcus?
3. My goal is to save money. I put in a reasonable amount of money to grow interest on. But I won't be able to make monthly contributions. Is this okay?
4. I have read people have a lot of trouble getting money out of Marcus. So that is why I tried to be proactive. I did not use the Marcus app to link my external account to it. Instead, I used my external account to PUSH money into Marcus. When this money matures, can I do the same thing, just use my external account to PULL the money out of Marcus and back into my external account?
5. Can I make monthly credit card payments using my Marcus Savings Account routing number and account number? Never more than about $100 a month, but is that possible? I have heard you can make up with 6 of these ""paying your bills"" type transactions a month. But I am wondering if Marcus does that?
6. Does Marcus offer any way that I can get checks?
7. I noticed Marcus's 14 month CD account just went from 4.40% to 4.25% overnight. This is shocking. Did anybody else notice this change? Is Marcus good about keeping everyone up to date on the savings account rate? I'd like to know when the rate goes up or down.
8. Do you believe Marcus Savings Account rates will go UP in the near future?
9. Can Marcus help me sell advertising space on my truck?
10. Does Marcus send you free pre-paid envelopes if you want to deposit a check into your Marcus account?

Just a year ago, I was running a marathon with my dad.  
We dreamed of opening a small coffee shop together.  
I genuinely believed life was only just beginning.

But then, in September last year, he passed away.  
And suddenly, the world went quiet.  
The pain was unbearable.  
No brothers. No sisters. No family left.  
Just me. Alone, trying to carry on.

I took a job as a bartender ‚Äî six months of long nights, empty smiles and trying to feel normal.  
But something wasn‚Äôt right.  
I remember the day I realised something was wrong ‚Äî

I‚Äôll never forget it.

Now... I‚Äôm in a hospice.  
Stage four cancer.  
It‚Äôs spread to my lungs and liver.  
The doctors say I don‚Äôt have long left.

You know, when you reach this point, you stop being afraid of dying.  
What you really fear ‚Äî is being forgotten.  
That your voice will disappear,  
as if you were never really here at all.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this.

**Forgive ‚Äî don‚Äôt hold back.**  
**Live ‚Äî like there‚Äôs no tomorrow.**

I would give anything to walk outside again,  
to feel the breeze on my face,  
to wander into a caf√© and order a coffee.  
But I can‚Äôt anymore.

**You still can.**

If you‚Äôve read this far ‚Äî thank you.  
Truly, thank you.

There‚Äôs one last dream I‚Äôm holding onto.  
A dream I want to bring to life before I go.  
And I‚Äôm willing to give everything I have left to it.

Here‚Äôs my truth:  
I‚Äôve been passionate about crypto since 2017.  
And I‚Äôve always dreamt of building a crypto exchange that‚Äôs free from KYC,  
free from the chains of regulation and red tape.

Let‚Äôs build something pure ‚Äî  
an honest, reliable platform where people are free to trade without fear, without intrusion.  
Let‚Äôs make crypto what it was always meant to be.

I want the world to know what we‚Äôre building.  
Let‚Äôs bring back freedom to this space ‚Äî together.

I‚Äôve thought it all through. I have a plan.  
And though my time is short, I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm all yours.

Until last summer she called my boyfriend stating she wanted to ‚Äúvoice her concerns‚Äù about me. And wanted him to come to their home state so they could have ‚Äúfamily conversations‚Äù about me. My boyfriend said no she could say what she needed to on the phone. Proceeded to lie and say I said things I didn‚Äôt say or lie about the context, tell my bf to get an apartment so he can ‚Äúbring people over‚Äù‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt care if he has friends over we all know what she meant, that he needs to go spend more time around other college students to keep his options open, my parents pay for trips sometimes for my bf and I and she genuinely thought he only was dating me for travel and he didn‚Äôt love me she was like ‚Äúwell aren‚Äôt you just dating her for travel, that isn‚Äôt sustainable.‚Äù I know for a fact my bf never said that. Also because my family after this incident quit paying for travel and he‚Äôs still around, she just assumed that, wonderful to know what she thinks of me. Said if he got me pregnant his life would be ruined because he‚Äôd be stuck with me. That I was trying to baby trap him because I said I wanted kids in the future‚Ä¶ it was insane. 

Anyway my bf went low contact with her for a year but recently his grandmother passed away, he called her basically to see where she was at with everything that had been said to see if he wanted to go to the funeral. Well, according to him she apologized to him and wanted to apologize to me too, against my better judgement I agreed. 

Well we get on the phone and she starts blaming everything on everyone else. Blaming me for not communicating things better, blaming my boyfriend, her ex husband for some conflict between us that started this, like she is not a grown woman who can either choose to listen to her ex husband or her own son. I said some of the stuff she said was just kinda mean and she was like ‚Äúwell I think it was just misunderstood.‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt know I heard her say it, we were in a hotel room when she did that how was I not? When my bf and her were fighting over the things that she had said and he quit talking to her she had the audacity to reach out to my parents trying to involve them in it, we were literal adults at that point and she is reaching out to my freaking parents. Then she had the nerve to tell me it wasn‚Äôt right that they didn‚Äôt respond to her. Like sorry you can‚Äôt turn everyone in my life against me including my own freaking parents. And no she did not know my parents well she met my mom twice and my dad once. My dad and I live in different states and from the beginning my mom has avoided her like the plague because she‚Äôs been so passive aggressive and rude. She also said I should‚Äôve invited her to my house I‚Äôm like really do you invite people to your house who speak about you that way. 

Anyway all of this, standard mil drama. What is not normal, is how easily she manipulates my boyfriend. For example, my boyfriend totally threw me to the wolves having me talk to her, it was apparent from the start she was not sorry for what she did. My boyfriend just believed that her bs excuses were apologies. Also, when she called my boyfriend stating that she wanted him to fly there and have ‚Äúfamily conversations‚Äù he actually said ok originally and had her book a plane ticket. I lost my shit and he was like ‚Äúwell I was just gonna go see her I just planned on not talking.‚Äù And I was like um no that is not ok on any level if you do that we‚Äôre done. But when I explained it he was like ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre right.‚Äù She has this way of getting into his head which I know stems from a lifetime of conditioning but my boyfriend has some kind of weird inability to argue with her even though he might want to or to even see the crap she pulls for what it is. 

I know he does love me, his dad locked me in a car and screamed at me for 2 hours, granted my bf still did not defend me when it happened but he did cut his dad off and has never spoken to him again. And called him and kinda lost his shit on him afterward. And my bf was 18 when that happened, for being 18 he handled it well. So anyway he does care about me it is something with his mom he just cannot handle her. He says he needs therapy over these issues. 

I said I agreed on the therapy but I cannot take another year of her acting this way and constantly having to feel like I have to defend myself. I told him either he goes no contact for a year and he goes and gets therapy like he promised he would years ago, and we can revisit this in a year or I‚Äôll put first and last on an apartment for him and he has to go.

To be honest, I don‚Äôt think contact with her again will ever be possible. She has no ability to own when she is wrong, whenever we are on vacation and she knows about it she always has to do something to upset my bf and ruin our trip or if she can, prevents us from going at all. She throws passive aggressive comments at me all the time like she was talking about all the ways people in her life has lost weight, it was evident in the way she was doing it she was trying to give me advice. I went through a time of very severe depression and gained weight and tbh what she was super rude. I just can‚Äôt deal with the passive aggressive comments anymore and when we have kids I definitely don‚Äôt want her around them. I am planning on moving abroad and starting the next chapter of my life. I can‚Äôt set up another season of my life surrounding avoiding her outbursts. Am I wrong for telling my boyfriend this tho? I feel bad but I see no other solution.

1ktkvkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ktkvkj/im_so_tired_of_being_told_youre_so_amazing_you/,"I'm so tired of being told ""you're so amazing, you deserve better, you deserve...""","I recognize a lot of people have it much worse than I do so I feel terrible venting about this.

  
Dating is not a problem for me, finding someone to be intimate with, is not usually all that difficult for me. I'm decently conventionally attractive which is bolstered by the fact that I take very good care of my body and I look somewhat like a fitness model. But I have never been in a healthy long term relationship my entire life. I'm turning 31 next Thursday.

  
Anytime I actually feel a spark for a girl and it seems reciprocated it's amazing, they tell me repeatedly how amazing I am and how well cared for they feel. I told one woman how I told my friend that she was super smart and funny and uses really big words that I don't know, and she started crying because apparently most men only describe women they're dating only in relation to themselves and how they make them feel. I don't drink coffee but the first time I anticipated one woman sleeping over I bought her several cold brews ahead of time cause I knew she did and she loved that. I try to be considerate, I've learned more and more about what I can do with the seemingly endless amount of situationships I've had. I will massage a girl for over half an hour watching TV just cause, the ""reward"" I get sometimes is great, but I really just love that someone I really want to spend time with will just hang with me and do nothing, and I want to do something for them so it's worth it. And don't get me wrong, I love the sex too, and I will usually go down on a woman or use my hands to get them off or very close first before I start to push for myself. I can go on about the times that women have told me how much they love what I do for them and how they've never been treated better and what a catch I am.

  
But I can count on one hand, no one finger actually, when a woman I've wanted to be with has told me they like me. I've never been told ""I love you, I need you."" When to me, even if I've never said it, some of these women I've fallen for, and it's hurt so badly when it ends. When it does end I hear the same thing over and over again, ""I'm not sure I was attracted to you, I didn't get that spark, I really wanted to because you're so wonderful, but I usually would have felt it by now. You deserve someone who's going to give as much as you do, you deserve someone who wants a relationship right now, and I'm just not ready...""

  
And that's valid, there's no spark okay. But I hate being told I deserve x or y. I know what I deserve, and it's to get what I fucking want for once. I don't want or need you to give as much as me. I love giving and making someone feel loved. I just want you to be there and be yourself and tell me you care about me. To need me as much as I need you. Tell me you love me. I don't need you to do anything for me. Give it time, give me a shot, maybe it's that slow love. 



Everything I've been reading from my therapist tells me I'm anxiously attached, and I'm going for avoidantly attached people and that if they stuck it out and did the work, that it would be a great relationship. I've curbed most of the negative habits anxiously attached people do in relationships that affect the other person and I keep working to be a better and better partner, but I'm just not enough. 

  
When will I be enough? When will someone tell me they need me? I keep pushing it as far as I can to be more and do more for the other person and I'm still not enough.

  
The last person I dated was the first person I fell hard for in a long time. We only went on two dates, but in that time we talked so much and it felt like a movie how well it went. We joked repeatedly that we had so much in common that it would be more weird if we found something we didn't have in common with each other. But we started on accident, and she had just been cheated on by her partner/husband of 9 years last year. She just separated from him two months before we started talking/dating. When things got physical it was amazing, and I stopped when she wanted to because she wasn't ready for sex yet. We spent the rest of the night talking and planning things we would do together. We talked about building a stronger connection before sleeping with each other. Then the next day she told me it was too much and too overwhelming and she needed to figure herself out first post-divorce and that I'm a truly amazing person, but I deserve someone that is also ready for a relationship. 

How she feels is totally valid, she must still be grieving that relationship and who she thought her husband was pre-affair. It must be very jarring to do it all with someone else so relatively soon. But all I can think about is that if I was more or better in some way, then she would've stayed, given me a shot. Healed while taking it slowly and moving forward with me at whatever pace she needed. 

This was 3 weeks ago now I think, and I'm stuck on her like I tend to be when I actually develop feelings for someone which is pretty rare nowadays. 

  
I'm so tired of this. I'm so fucking tired of this and I want to die. I can't go through this again and again and again and again. I deserve to get what I want for once. I deserve what seems so easy for everyone else. I look around and I feel like I could do so much better than what these other men are giving into their relationships and yet I'm the one that's alone. I want it to be over.",1,1748010280.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I recently took a leap of faith by selling my Fuji + Canon mirrorless cameras that I've been using for years, after I confirmed that I'm happy enough with Find X8 Ultra's master mode.

It still can't fully match the versatility and quality of my sold cameras, but for someone who wants to occasionally take very satisfying pictures when commuting / traveling, I can say that Find X8 Ultra delivers... when in master mode. The normal mode produces pictures that are too ""smartphone"".

With the mode I now see this phone as a camera: I become very careful when taking pictures with this mode. Instead of simply snapping, I take my time in composing my shots. I take time in editing the resulting pics (mostly shadow/highlight/exposure) and I also delete pictures that are not good -- keeping my photos app tidy.

This is the phone with a case that allows filter (from AliExpress), I put a K&F black mist filter 1/2 (the 1/4 was too weak for my taste). The filter doesn't shift the colors significantly and reduces sharpness to a degree. I like the effect of it.

[Taken from my old iPhone](https://preview.redd.it/oz72776ihj2f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36b8377fbb42fd99931b866de01f2f2484356c9c)

  
And here are the images that I am very pleased with so far. I edited them but didn't change the colors much. I changed the exposure (usually bumping up), highlight (usually toning down), shadow (almost always toning it down to -30 or so), black point (-1 or -2 to wash the black out subtly), and slight desaturation and sharpening.

And realised that while it definitely works that way for me (reducing social anxiety and helping let loose / calm inner critic in the head and mask as being more social / easy-going), there seems to be more to it as I feel that sipping a drink / holding a cup or glass is a form of stimming or protection to me. Like I almost feel I have a shield and without a glass or with empty glass I'm almost feeling more vulnerable for some reason (maybe lack of stimulation as I participate in conversation but passively - and ""sipping"" gets that much-ADHD-beloved shift of attention to something new). I realised this can be with non-alcoholic drinks too as I drink quite a lot of water, need to have a glass with water or cup of tea / coffee constantly with me while I'm working. And can sip it quite frequently during some zoom calls at work, alternating between several glasses and cups I'd have on my table. It's generally fine with water but just becomes annoying when I'm in the context where ""default drink"" is alcoholic (like in pubs or at the parties) - there (probably just subconsciously trying not to stand out) I go for that option and ""stimming"" can make me drunk fairly quickly especially in a more stressful environment with noise / lots of unfamiliar people.

1ktksdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1ktksdz/worldbuilding_thought_process_issues/,Worldbuilding Thought Process Issues,"Hey everyone. Ive got kind of a weirdly specific question around my worldbuilding thought process.

So im working on kind of 2 projects right now. My brain likes to bounce between science fiction and high fantasy so i have one for each genre. Originally the worlds stemmed from me being a DM for D&D for the fantasy, and my desire for a more realistic science fiction world.

Here lies my problem. I know im getting way to deep into the details too quickly. I get stuck on small things and because of such i never gain the progress on the story itself. But ill get weirdly specific ecology breakdowns for a region on the map 2000+ years before the story actually starts.

My specific examples are for my projects. In the fantasy world, i want the focus to be on this adventuring party who basically decided to be adventurers for their own specific selfish reasons but dont understand the cost of being a true hero and what being a hero actually means, and that in the end, the people who are willing to selflessly sacrifice for those they care about, even to their own detriment at times, are true heroes. I want the final fight to be against this sadistic dracolich who'se goal is to outlast everything (time, space, even death), and to be the cause of its downfall. Its the ultimate game for him. 

The details of the dracolich are well along the way. The party? Not a clue. You want to know why? Because my brain wants to make 3000+ years of lore including how the universe this is set in even came into being, how the planets formed, how geography was shaped, how life on the planet was created, how the first civilizations formed, how those civilizations migrated, magic relics that were forged and created and yadda yadda all the way up to how that effects society of the day in which the ACTUAL story is set because THEN my brain will accept creating a character for that society. I dont know why im doing this, its annoying as hell. And i know that whoever id let read this isnt going to get it because they dont know that ""these regions speak two different dialects because of lore reason #9385"". 

Likewise on the science fiction end, i want to make a game that uses realistic space physics (think Kerbal Space Program) and allows you to explore and fight aliens throughout the galaxy. Problem here is im stuck again with the details. Ive designed an entire exo-atmospheric naval capital ship fleet, like 8 different fighters, gunships, helicopters, tanks, amphibious assault vehicles, designations for them, yadda yadda but thats it. I want to make a campaign mode for it with a story not just focus on the super specific stuff that only im ever going to see and understand.

Anyone got some advice on where to point this energy? Cuz it feels like when I dont know how to move a story along i just do.... this. I focus on the specifics and just tumble down a details hole and forget where i was going with anything. Could really use an assist here.

**Chabuzen -** I can't explain how absolutely yummy this ramen was (100% vegan) - it is a tiny place though (only 2 small tables) but when I went it was empty so I didn't have to wait¬†

**CoCo Ichibanya** (has a vegetarian curry and locations throughout Japan) - I went to one in Sendagaya but I think all chains of this place have a vegetarian curry option (I also asked if they could add vegetables to mine and they were able to accommodate that!)

**Brown Rice Tokyo Omotesando¬†-** this place was another one of my favorites!! Authentic Japanese meals but 100% vegan. Wasn't a huge fan of the citrus tart I got for dessert though :/

**Kyoto**

**Gyoza Chao Chao (Shijo Kawaramachi) -** had a long line (waiting was \~1 hour), was good (maybe 7.5 or 8/10) - variety of gyozas and lots of veggie options! My favorite was the chocolate dessert gyoza.

**Thilaga Indian Restaurant -** Loved this! I am a South Indian so it was a lovely taste of south India in Japan!¬†

**Tenryuji Temple Shigetsu¬†-** had this as part of a tour and it was a very unique experience; there were lots of tofu based dishes and various forms of tofu that I never knew before!

**ELLORA -** Indian restaurant, 7/10¬†(nothing super noteworthy, they were short staffed also unfortunately)

**Hiroshima**¬†

**Jirokichi -** absolutely DELICIOUS okonomiyaki! I got the mochi and cheese one and the restaurant chef and I had a nice conservation about anime and it gave me a chance to practice my Japanese!

**Okonomimura (specifically Tensei) -** good, 9/10, Okonomimura is an entire building dedicated to a bunch of diff Okonomiyaki restaurants and Tensei I believe was on the third floor? Don‚Äôt quote me on that though.

**Nara/Osaka**

**Mizuya Chaya -** delicious udon with a vegan broth option! The deer are just hanging out outside when you eat too so it‚Äôs a lovely sight :)¬†

Hi

I live in a country where the GP will only help with TRT when you are below 150.

I am working with a company that ""optimizes"" male health.

I'm taking .44 weekly of testosterone enanthate split to .22 every 3 days. I am also taking HCG the same dosage.

I am sweating PROFUSELY! Like need to change my shirt 3,4,5 times a day sweating. I thought it was the test and cut down and made no difference, I went on a trip and couldn't refrigerate the HCG so I skipped it for 2 weeks and my sweating got better.

My doc says it's anxiety as it seems to come after coffee, but I used to drink a pot of coffee a day before the TRT. I think it's the HCG but I was on vacation so I could have been more relaxed.

Anyone else have this issue before?",1,1748009828.0,FYRbody,2,1.0,False
1ktkp2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ktkp2s/electrolytes/,Electrolytes,"Hi all, I'm on keto for about a year and I'm extremely satisfied with everything I achieved and the progress. Not going to stop. 

For the last 6 months I eat twice a day and only then I used salt (normal kitchen salt). 

About a week ago suddenly I felt strange, like I was about to faint or something. I got back to faq here and the conclusion was that I need electrolytes. I bought potassium (30%) salt and started to drink it with water. Like 2-3 tablespoons during the day. And it helped I think, I feel almost normal. 

Now the question - what could be the symptoms of not enough / too much salt intake? Could it be dangerous if I use much too much? Also how do you use it, drink water with 1-3 tablespoons once a day? Or add a bit to each glass of water/coffee/ whatever you drink?",4,1748009806.0,keto,13,1.0,False

Last week we got into a huge fight because I went to Costco and I asked him to simply put the water bottles away. he didnt and went up stairs to get into bed. I went upstairs in a rage and grabbed is legs and hit them while he was under the blankets and he then tried to say that I was abusive towards him, I agree I shouldn't of hit him I just have all of this built up anger. Anytime even before this when I would ask him what he wants to do about out relationship if we will ever get married or have kids his response is ""well see"" and I hate that. its so rude to a women who's gone above and beyond. Meantime I moved 2 hours from home to be with him, and start a life here. meantime im commuting 3-4 days a week back home to just work and see my huge family. He never buys me presents, he never makes me feel special with any love or affection, he yells at me when I ask him to do simple things like pick his stuff off the floor and the trash to be taken out. Keep in mind im buying all the grocieres and doing everything around the house. what do I do?",1,1748009802.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False
1ktko6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1ktko6j/4_days_postop/,4 Days Post-Op,"Hello, I (28M) went in for my robot assisted laporascopic surgery last Monday, 5/19, and I was one of the first cases of the day. I went in only somewhat expecting what would happen since for my job, I actually clean the surgery rooms at the very hospital I was getting my cholecystectomy at. I was diagnosed in mid April with gallbladder sludge after two months of intermittent nausea and back aches. I have never had surgery before and I was hoping there was a way to clear the sludge with low fat diet instead of getting rid of it. Well I was wrong, everyone told me that my gallbladder was only going to get worse and it was the best option to get ahead of the curve, before I started getting gallstones and gallbladder attacks. I reluctantly weighed my options and decided it was the best course of action for my long-term health. Up until my surgery after switching to a very low-fat diet, I noticed my nausea was basically gone. I occassionally ate fast food with no flares. So it made the contrasting experience of pre-op to post-op so much more stark. 

I get into the prep room, I'm incredibly scared. I get the rundown, the meds, they hook me up to the leads, and I wait patiently for my anesthesiologist to come in and tell me what he's going to do with me. He was very friendly, and he assured me he will be right next to me through every minute of the procedure, watching my vitals and keeping me safe and unconscious. Then he gave me an anxiety med through the IV. It made me feel very lightheaded but it slowed my heart rate very quickly and next thing I know, they're moving me onto the OR table and starting to insert the propofol into the IV. I only counted down to 8 before I was out. And being under anesthetics is crazy. You definitely pass out fast. It's like when you're so tired and you go to bed, you don't dream at all and you just wake up and it's already sunny outside. I came too and I was extremely groggy. I don't even remember them taking the tube out of my throat. I was already coming out of recovery and going back into the prep room to wait until the anesthesia wore off. I think the worst part of being so heavily sedated is fighting off falling back asleep and going into an apnea episode (where you stop breathing on your own). Every time it happened, my monitor would start dinging and I would consciously have to breathe. That lasted for roughly an hour and a half  before I had my family come back to see me. It took forever for me to be awake enough to sit up and try walking. I did so, and the gas pain was incredibly uncomfortable, very painful!! Like 8/10! It felt so tight on my incisions, I couldn't even stand up straight. I felt like a pinching stabbing pressure on my diaphragm and it radiated into my right shoulder blade. It was worse than the pre-op pain by a significant degree. It is probably easier for others to deal with if they had bad gallbladder flares before the surgery, but I wasn't having them. This gas pain lasted days, I tried to walk as much as I comfortably could before it was too much to get the gas to reabsorb into me. I took lots of Gas X too. 

They sent me home with oxycodone, but I already have weened myself off because 1) the incisions really aren't that painful and 2) I had to start taking Zofran after my neck patch wore off and that medicine has a risky interaction with Oxycodone. Now I treat my pain with Tylenol and Ibuprofen. The only real issue I am dealing with at this point is the constipation. Constipation is no joke when it comes to surgery. You HAVE to stay on top of it as soon as you're home. Take stool softeners! Anesthesia and opioids slow down your gut motility really bad. It's been four days since I've had a bowel movement and I've been trying every option I have to pass stoll. You're either gonna deal with constipation or diarrhea either way. Your body has to adapt to not having a gallbladder and that takes weeks. 

As for diet, do NOT get your favorite fast food burger the day after your surgery. I talked to many people who made this mistake, you will be putting yourself at risk of severe colon flushing or even vomiting (which you especially don't want with fresh abdominal incisions). You have to reintroduce fat into your diet. I started with mostly soft food and liquid diet, extremely low fat. I was eating non fat yogurt, applesauce, low fat soup, pudding, jello, and water on my first few days post op. The last two days I've been reintroducing toast and eggs and eating slowly. I'm gonna try to drink a coffee later, hoping it will get some success with bowel movements. 

Surgery recovery is rough. I hope I will see the end of this madness soon. I really al curious what the ratio is for most people on here who can handle high fat food versus those who can't post-recovery. Relearning how my body will react to certain foods sure as hell is going to be an unpleasant experience. Let's pray I can be as close to normal as possible. 

I plan on cleaning my incisions today. They already look very healed despite only being less than a week out from surgery. That's the beauty of the Da Vinci robot that did my surgery. 

Anyways take care yall. Ask any questions if needed.  ",3,1748009744.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False
