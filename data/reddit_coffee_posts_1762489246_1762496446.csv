1oqmws6,https://www.reddit.com/r/agi/comments/1oqmws6/why_ai_memory_is_so_hard_to_build/,Why AI memory is so hard to build?,"I’ve spent the past eight months deep in the trenches of AI memory systems. What started as a straightforward engineering challenge-”just make the AI remember things”-has revealed itself to be one of the most philosophically complex problems in artificial intelligence. Every solution I’ve tried has exposed new layers of difficulty, and every breakthrough has been followed by the realization of how much further there is to go.

The promise sounds simple: build a system where AI can remember facts, conversations, and context across sessions, then recall them intelligently when needed.

**The Illusion of Perfect Memory**

Early on, I operated under a naive assumption: perfect memory would mean storing everything and retrieving it instantly. If humans struggle with imperfect recall, surely giving AI total recall would be an upgrade, right?

Wrong. I quickly discovered that even defining what to remember is extraordinarily difficult. Should the system remember every word of every conversation? Every intermediate thought? Every fact mentioned in passing? The volume becomes unmanageable, and more importantly, most of it doesn’t matter.

Human memory is selective precisely because it’s useful. We remember what’s emotionally significant, what’s repeated, what connects to existing knowledge. We forget the trivial. AI doesn’t have these natural filters. It doesn’t know what matters. This means building memory for AI isn’t about creating perfect recall-it’s about building judgment systems that can distinguish signal from noise.

And here’s the first hard lesson: most current AI systems either overfit (memorizing training data too specifically) or underfit (forgetting context too quickly). Finding the middle ground-adaptive memory that generalizes appropriately and retains what’s meaningful-has proven far more elusive than I anticipated.

**How Today’s AI Memory Actually Works**

Before I could build something better, I needed to understand what already exists. And here’s the uncomfortable truth I discovered: most of what’s marketed as “AI memory” isn’t really memory at all. It’s sophisticated note-taking with semantic search.

Walk into any AI company today, and you’ll find roughly the same architecture. First, they capture information from conversations or documents. Then they chunk it-breaking content into smaller pieces, usually 500-2000 tokens. Next comes embedding: converting those chunks into vector representations that capture semantic meaning. These embeddings get stored in a vector database like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Chroma. When a new query arrives, the system embeds the query and searches for similar vectors. Finally, it augments the LLM’s context by injecting the retrieved chunks.

This is Retrieval-Augmented Generation-RAG-and it’s the backbone of nearly every “memory” system in production today. It works reasonably well for straightforward retrieval: “What did I say about project X?” But it’s not memory in any meaningful sense. It’s search.

The more sophisticated systems use what’s called Graph RAG. Instead of just storing text chunks, these systems extract entities and relationships, building a graph structure: “Adam WORKS\_AT Company Y,” “Company Y PRODUCES cars,” “Meeting SCHEDULED\_WITH Company Y.” Graph RAG can answer more complex queries and follow relationships. It’s better at entity resolution and can traverse connections.

But here’s what I learned through months of experimentation: it’s still not memory. It’s a more structured form of search. The fundamental limitation remains unchanged-these systems don’t understand what they’re storing. They can’t distinguish what’s important from what’s trivial. They can’t update their understanding when facts change. They can’t connect new information to existing knowledge in genuinely novel ways.

This realization sent me back to fundamentals. If the current solutions weren’t enough, what was I missing?

**Storage Is Not Memory**

My first instinct had been similar to these existing solutions: treat memory as a database problem. Store information in SQL for structured data, use NoSQL for flexibility, or leverage vector databases for semantic search. Pick the right tool and move forward.

But I kept hitting walls. A user would ask a perfectly reasonable question, and the system would fail to retrieve relevant information-not because the information wasn’t stored, but because the storage format made that particular query impossible. I learned, slowly and painfully, that storage and retrieval are inseparable. How you store data fundamentally constrains how you can recall it later.

Structured databases require predefined schemas-but conversations are unstructured and unpredictable. Vector embeddings capture semantic similarity-but lose precise factual accuracy. Graph databases preserve relationships-but struggle with fuzzy, natural language queries. Every storage method makes implicit decisions about what kinds of questions you can answer.

Use SQL, and you’re locked into the queries your schema supports. Use vector search, and you’re at the mercy of embedding quality and semantic drift. This trade-off sits at the core of every AI memory system: we want comprehensive storage with intelligent retrieval, but every technical choice limits us. There is no universal solution. Each approach opens some doors while closing others.

This led me deeper into one particular rabbit hole: vector search and embeddings.

**Vector Search and the Embedding Problem**

Vector search had seemed like the breakthrough when I first encountered it. The idea is elegant: convert everything to embeddings, store them in a vector database, and retrieve semantically similar content when needed. Flexible, fast, scalable-what’s not to love?

The reality proved messier. I discovered that different embedding models capture fundamentally different aspects of meaning. Some excel at semantic similarity, others at factual relationships, still others at emotional tone. Choose the wrong model, and your system retrieves irrelevant information. Mix models across different parts of your system, and your embeddings become incomparable-like trying to combine measurements in inches and centimeters without converting.

But the deeper problem is temporal. Embeddings are frozen representations. They capture how a model understood language at a specific point in time. When the base model updates or when the context of language use shifts, old embeddings drift out of alignment. You end up with a memory system that’s remembering through an outdated lens-like trying to recall your childhood through your adult vocabulary. It sort of works, but something essential is lost in translation.

**This became painfully clear when I started testing queries.**

The Query Problem: Infinite Questions, Finite Retrieval

Here’s a challenge that has humbled me repeatedly: what I call the query problem.

Take a simple stored fact: “Meeting at 12:00 with customer X, who produces cars.”

Now consider all the ways someone might query this information:

“Do I have a meeting today?”

“Who am I meeting at noon?”

“What time is my meeting with the car manufacturer?”

“Are there any meetings between 10 and 13:00?”

“Do I ever meet anyone from customer X?”

“Am I meeting any automotive companies this week?”

Every one of these questions refers to the same underlying fact, but approaches it from a completely different angle: time-based, entity-based, categorical, existential. And this isn’t even an exhaustive list-there are dozens more ways to query this single fact.

Humans handle this effortlessly. We just remember. We don’t consciously translate natural language into database queries-we retrieve based on meaning and context, instantly recognizing that all these questions point to the same stored memory.

For AI, this is an enormous challenge. The number of possible ways to query any given fact is effectively infinite. The mechanisms we have for retrieval-keyword matching, semantic similarity, structured queries-are all finite and limited. A robust memory system must somehow recognize that these infinitely varied questions all point to the same stored information. And yet, with current technology, each query formulation might retrieve completely different results, or fail entirely.

This gap-between infinite query variations and finite retrieval mechanisms-is where AI memory keeps breaking down. And it gets worse when you add another layer of complexity: entities.

**The Entity Problem: Who Is Adam?**

One of the subtlest but most frustrating challenges has been entity resolution. When someone says “I met Adam yesterday,” the system needs to know which Adam. Is this the same Adam mentioned three weeks ago? Is this a new Adam? Are “Adam,” “Adam Smith,” and “Mr. Smith” the same person?

Humans resolve this effortlessly through context and accumulated experience. We remember faces, voices, previous conversations. We don’t confuse two people with the same name because we intuitively track continuity across time and space.

AI has no such intuition. Without explicit identifiers, entities fragment across memories. You end up with disconnected pieces: “Adam likes coffee,” “Adam from accounting,” “That Adam guy”-all potentially referring to the same person, but with no way to know for sure. The system treats them as separate entities, and suddenly your memory is full of phantom people.

Worse, entities evolve. “Adam moved to London.” “Adam changed jobs.” “Adam got promoted.” A true memory system must recognize that these updates refer to the same entity over time, that they represent a trajectory rather than disconnected facts. Without entity continuity, you don’t have memory-you have a pile of disconnected observations.

This problem extends beyond people to companies, projects, locations-any entity that persists across time and appears in different forms. Solving entity resolution at scale, in unstructured conversational data, remains an open problem. And it points to something deeper: AI doesn’t track continuity because it doesn’t experience time the way we do.

**Interpretation and World Models**

The deeper I got into this problem, the more I realized that memory isn’t just about facts-it’s about interpretation. And interpretation requires a world model that AI simply doesn’t have.

Consider how humans handle queries that depend on subjective understanding. “When did I last meet someone I really liked?” This isn’t a factual query-it’s an emotional one. To answer it, you need to retrieve memories and evaluate them through an emotional lens. Which meetings felt positive? Which people did you connect with? Human memory effortlessly tags experiences with emotional context, and we can retrieve based on those tags.

Or try this: “Who are my prospects?” If you’ve never explicitly defined what a “prospect” is, most AI systems will fail. But humans operate with implicit world models. We know that a prospect is probably someone who asked for pricing, expressed interest in our product, or fits a certain profile. We don’t need formal definitions-we infer meaning from context and experience.

AI lacks both capabilities. When it stores “meeting at 2pm with John,” there’s no sense of whether that meeting was significant, routine, pleasant, or frustrating. There’s no emotional weight, no connection to goals or relationships. It’s just data. And when you ask “Who are my prospects?”, the system has no working definition of what “prospect” means unless you’ve explicitly told it.

This is the world model problem. Two people can attend the same meeting and remember it completely differently. One recalls it as productive; another as tense. The factual event-”meeting occurred”-is identical, but the meaning diverges based on perspective, mood, and context. Human memory is subjective, colored by emotion and purpose, and grounded in a rich model of how the world works.

AI has no such model. It has no “self” to anchor interpretation to. We remember what matters to us-what aligns with our goals, what resonates emotionally, what fits our mental models of the world. AI has no “us.” It has no intrinsic interests, no persistent goals, no implicit understanding of concepts like “prospect” or “liked.”

This isn’t just a retrieval problem-it’s a comprehension problem. Even if we could perfectly retrieve every stored fact, the system wouldn’t understand what we’re actually asking for. “Show me important meetings” requires knowing what “important” means in your context. “Who should I follow up with?” requires understanding social dynamics and business relationships. “What projects am I falling behind on?” requires a model of priorities, deadlines, and progress.

Without a world model, even perfect information storage isn’t really memory-it’s just a searchable archive. And a searchable archive can only answer questions it was explicitly designed to handle.

This realization forced me to confront the fundamental architecture of the systems I was trying to build.

**Training as Memory**

Another approach I explored early on was treating training itself as memory. When the AI needs to remember something new, fine-tune it on that data. Simple, right?

Catastrophic forgetting destroyed this idea within weeks. When you train a neural network on new information, it tends to overwrite existing knowledge. To preserve old knowledge, you’d need to continually retrain on all previous data-which becomes computationally impossible as memory accumulates. The cost scales exponentially.

Models aren’t modular. Their knowledge is distributed across billions of parameters in ways we barely understand. You can’t simply merge two fine-tuned models and expect them to remember both datasets. Model A + Model B ≠ Model A+B. The mathematics doesn’t work that way. Neural networks are holistic systems where everything affects everything else.

Fine-tuning works for adjusting general behavior or style, but it’s fundamentally unsuited for incremental, lifelong memory. It’s like rewriting your entire brain every time you learn a new fact. The architecture just doesn’t support it.

So if we can’t train memory in, and storage alone isn’t enough, what constraints are we left with?

**The Context Window**

Large language models have a fundamental constraint that shapes everything: the context window. This is the model’s “working memory”-the amount of text it can actively process at once.

When you add long-term memory to an LLM, you’re really deciding what information should enter that limited context window. This becomes a constant optimization problem: include too much, and the model fails to answer question or loses focus. Include too little, and it lacks crucial information.

I’ve spent months experimenting with context management strategies-priority scoring, relevance ranking, time-based decay. Every approach involves trade-offs. Aggressive filtering risks losing important context. Inclusive filtering overloads the model and dilutes its attention.

And here’s a technical wrinkle I didn’t anticipate: context caching. Many LLM providers cache context prefixes to speed up repeated queries. But when you’re dynamically constructing context with memory retrieval, those caches constantly break. Every query pulls different memories, reconstructing different context, invalidating caches and performance goes down and cost goes up.

I’ve realized that AI memory isn’t just about storage-it’s fundamentally about attention management. The bottleneck isn’t what the system can store; it’s what it can focus on. And there’s no perfect solution, only endless trade-offs between completeness and performance, between breadth and depth.

**What We Can Build Today**

The dream of true AI memory-systems that remember like humans do, that understand context and evolution and importance-remains out of reach.

But that doesn’t mean we should give up. It means we need to be honest about what we can actually build with today’s tools.

We need to leverage what we know works: structured storage for facts that need precise retrieval (SQL, document databases), vector search for semantic similarity and fuzzy matching, knowledge graphs for relationship traversal and entity connections, and hybrid approaches that combine multiple storage and retrieval strategies.

The best memory systems don’t try to solve the unsolvable. They focus on specific, well-defined use cases. They use the right tool for each kind of information. They set clear expectations about what they can and cannot remember.

The techniques that matter most in practice are tactical, not theoretical: entity resolution pipelines that actively identify and link entities across conversations; temporal tagging that marks when information was learned and when it’s relevant; explicit priority systems where users or systems mark what’s important and what should be forgotten; contradiction detection that flags conflicting information rather than silently storing both; and retrieval diversity that uses multiple search strategies in parallel-keyword matching, semantic search, graph traversal.

These aren’t solutions to the memory problem. They’re tactical approaches to specific retrieval challenges. But they’re what we have. And when implemented carefully, they can create systems that feel like memory, even if they fall short of the ideal.",1,1762496151.0,agi,0,1.0,False

It's survived thousands of shots in our family restaurant and hundreds more after my parents retired during home use. The machine was an absolute beast and made great espresso, the steaming wand frothed milk well enough for a cappuccino, and the pods were readily available up until recent years. 

For Christmas I'd like to treat my wife and I to a new machine but I'm having difficulty picking one. I initially thought I'd just track down a used Point machine but sourcing pods has been getting more difficult, especially the decaf ones (for my family and guests that ask for it, please don't ban me). I feel like it's only a matter of time before they're completely discontinued

My dad has the Lavazza Classy Plus machine and it seems to be treating him well enough. The espresso tastes good and the 8oz coffee setting tastes pretty damn good too. All using the same pods which is great. However, the machine seems messy, the spent pods are practically swimming in excess coffee. It also doesn't seem very durable. Anyone have experience on how many years they get out of one?

We have a Nespresso Verturo at work which makes decent espresso however it doesn't seem to get as hot as other machines. Not really a deal breaker just an observation. I spent some time on the website and it looks like you need separate pods for espresso and coffee. Has anyone just pushed the 8oz button with an espresso pod? I might need to try that out tomorrow at work. I do like that their pods are more sustainable with a recycling bag to send back spent pods to be recycled. I hadn't seen the cleanup of the pods so not sure if it's as messy as the Lavazza Classy

I’m a young guy (20s). Fit. Active. I’m in the gym 5 days a week. I do MMA. Have great friends. Surrounded by family. Lots of hobbies. I’m thankful for the blessings in my life. The last few months I’ve been dealing with anxiety. It’s been a stressful year indeed. Lost my grandma. Mom went through cancer (but beat it!). Got in a car accident. Broke up with my fiancé. But still did it with a smile on my face. The anxiety started creeping up on me slowly. 

I was so scared I got my heart checked multiple times. Had 3 EKG’s. Blood work. Chest X-Ray (was dealing with an MMA related injury). Made two trips to the ER. Met with my doctor. Everything came back normal. A few weeks back I had a terrible anxiety attack. I’m a caffeine addict. That day, I must’ve had about 4 servings of caffeine. I’m also a Zyn user. And I must’ve taken way too many that day. It was a full blown anxiety attack. I was laying on my floor curled up in a ball. Heart racing. This ball of anxiety in my stomach. I was EXHAUSTED after that. Since then, the anxiety has been off and on. It creeps up a little but nothing crazy. I’ve cut back on the caffeine and have limited the Zyns (trying to quit for good). Today, I had another anxiety attack. Came home from work. Showered. Ate dinner. It started creeping back up on me. I was laying on the couch watching football and decided to Google my symptoms which must have made it worse because…well my anxiety was through the roof. Heart racing, that pit in my stomach. I couldn’t explain it. 

I’m not sure why I’m here exactly. To vent. For support perhaps. I think ever since that day where I had a full blown attack from the caffeine, my mind has been hyper fixated on that. It’s constantly on my mind. Today, I had two cups of coffee. I’m not sure how big of a role coffee plays on anxiety. The combination of caffeine and nicotine definitely messes with me. 

That’s all I had to say really. I’m a little scared. But it’s nice knowing there’s others out there like me. I’m not too sure where this anxiety came from. I was never an anxious person. But here we are :) ",1,1762496087.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

I think the expectations for what we need to be doing around the shop are steadily becoming more and more for the high volume of customers compared to the staff. Plus weird things like not being allowed to write down orders, make latte art, or hold the airpots by their handles (yes I am so serious).

For example, the cafe I work at not only sells regular coffee and espresso but also sandwiches and soups that are made to order. That's not too bad. Typically, when we run out of ingredients or soup, we are sold out for the day, just like our pastries. Well, the staff just got a stern talking to about how we always need to keep soups stocked, thawing and using twice the amount of soup in a day that we normally do. However, one, we throw away soup quite often and two, we serve bread with every serving of soup. However, we only get around 3 loaves a bread a day delivered so if we double the soup, WE ARENT GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH BREAD. 

The other thing is needing to constantly rebrew the coffee. We keep 3 types of drip coffee and when it gets to 160, we need to start instantly rebrewing as well as the backup pot. So we have 6 pots of coffee. We spend more time rebrewing coffee now than regular side tasks. The coffee reaches 160 normally within an hour of brewing so its just constant grinding of beans, emptying containers and rebrewing all day. We cant even hold the coffee containers while holding something else (example, emptying 2 containers at once) because we are supposed to hold it with two hands YES THAT WAS IN THE MESSAGE SENT TO STAFF. 

Now Ima need someone to explain this logic to me because I dont think its makes sense. If we brew 6 pots at one time right......what is the point of the backup. THEY WILL ALL BE THE SAME TEMP. It makes more sense to just rebrew when cold or empty. We do not sell enough drip coffee to justify 6 giant containers at once taking up what little counter space we already have.

I think this standard is a bit ridiculous especially since we are short staffed constantly. The cafe is SMALL with a tiny tiny prep area and we will have 6 people on a good day, manning a drive through, sandwiches, and front counter and will constantly bump into each other running back and forth. We arent allowed to use the front sink for drainage so now we have to do everything in the back sink, creating even more of a bottleneck. Normally the shift will have 4 people to do all the above tasks plus

* prep our cold brew
* make teas
* make smoothies
* make yogurts
* make syrups (we order some but make the others)
* make sauces (we make all sauces like chocolate in-house)
* general cleaning and restock

All for $8 an hour plus tips. We can all see how much the cafe makes in a month (around 90k) yet staff are still paid peanuts. NO ONE besides the manager has full time hours. You will get max 25 hours. The turnover is extremely high as most people dont stay for a month because its so overwhelming. ",1,1762495950.0,barista,0,1.0,False

## Why a Washable Rug is Your RV's Best Friend

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=RV%20washable%20area%20rugs)

Think of a washable rug as the ultimate multitool for your RV's interior. It's not just a piece of fabric; it's a problem-solver.

*   **Effortless Cleaning:** Spills are inevitable. A pet accident, a tipped-over drink, or just the general grime of the outdoors? No problem. Most of these rugs can be tossed in a standard washing machine, coming out looking brand new.
*   **Allergy & Dust Control:** RVs are small, enclosed spaces. A rug traps dust, pollen, and dander that would otherwise be circulating in the air. Being able to wash it regularly means you're literally cleaning the air you breathe.
*   **Space-Saving Design:** Unlike thick, heavy rugs, most RV-friendly washable rugs are lightweight and low-profile. They won't interfere with slide-outs or create a major tripping hazard.
*   **Instant Style Upgrade:** Your RV is your home. A well-chosen rug can define your living space, add a pop of color, and provide a soft, comfortable surface for your feet.
*   **Protects Your Flooring:** Whether you have linoleum, vinyl, or laminate in your rig, a rug takes the daily wear and tear, protecting your original flooring from scratches and scuffs.

## Key Features to Look for in an RV Washable Area Rug

Ready to start shopping? Don't just grab the first ""washable"" rug you see. Here’s a checklist of features to consider for the best fit for your mobile lifestyle.

### ### Material Matters

The material dictates how the rug feels, how it cleans, and how long it lasts.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=RV%20washable%20area%20rugs)

*   **Cotton:** The classic choice. It's soft, highly absorbent, and gets softer with each wash. It's a great, breathable option for most climates.
*   **Chenille:** Often used in ""shag"" style rugs. It’s incredibly soft and cozy but can be a magnet for pet hair. Check if it's truly machine washable or just spot-cleanable.
*   **Microfiber:** A synthetic champion. It's extremely durable, stain-resistant, and dries quickly. It's a fantastic, low-maintenance choice for high-traffic areas.

### ### The Non-Slip Backing is Non-Negotiable

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=RV%20washable%20area%20rugs)

Your RV is constantly in motion. A rug that slides around is more than just annoying—it's a serious safety hazard. Look for rugs with a high-quality rubber or latex backing. This will keep the rug firmly in place on vinyl, wood, or laminate flooring, preventing slips and trips.

### ### Size & Thickness

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=RV%20washable%20area%20rugs)

This is critical for RV living.

*   **Thickness:** Go for a low-pile or flatweave rug. Anything too thick can stop your slide-out from operating correctly or create an uneven surface that's easy to trip on.
*   **Size:** Measure your space carefully! Consider where you want the rug to go. A common strategy is a runner in the galley/kitchen area and a smaller, rectangular rug in the main living zone. Ensure it fits comfortably within the walkway.

### ### Machine Washable vs. Spot Cleanable

"" Washable"" can be a vague term. Always, *always* check the care label *before* you buy.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=RV%20washable%20area%20rugs)

*   **Machine Washable:** This is the gold standard for RV owners. Look for instructions that say you can use a standard home washing machine (usually on a gentle cycle with cold water).
*   **Spot Cleanable:** These rugs can handle small spills, but you can't just toss them in the wash. This is less ideal for the general mess of RV life.

## Pro Tips for Caring for Your RV Rug

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=RV%20washable%20area%20rugs)

A little TLC goes a long way to keep your rug looking fresh for years to come.

1.  **Shake It Out:** Get into the habit of taking your rug outside every few days for a good shake. This dislodges loose dirt and debris before it gets ground in.
2.  **Spot Treat Immediately:** For fresh spills, blot with a clean cloth and a bit of mild soap and water. The sooner you treat it, the less likely it is to set.
3.  **Wash with Care:** When it's time for a deep clean, use cold water and a mild detergent. Avoid bleach, as it can break down the fibers and colors.
4.  **Air Dry is Best:** Most washable rugs should be air-dried. The high heat of a machine dryer can shrink the rug or damage the non-slip backing. Hang it over a shower rod, a clothesline, or lay it flat outside.

## Styling Your RV with a Washable Rug

Functionality is key, but let's not forget style! A rug is the easiest way to personalize your space.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=RV%20washable%20area%20rugs)

*   **Define Your Zones:** Use a rug to create distinct ""rooms"" in your RV's open floor plan. A rug under your dinette or in front of your sofa instantly creates a designated living area.
*   **Choose Your Vibe:** Are you a boho-chic adventurer? Go for a geometric or southwestern pattern. A minimalist? A solid neutral or a simple stripe works wonders. Your rug sets the tone for your entire interior.
*   **Add Layers:** For extra coziness, consider layering a smaller, decorative accent rug on top of a larger, neutral flatweave rug. This adds depth and texture.

## Hit the Road with Confidence

 At **ADNTRO**, you can learn **how you metabolize alcohol and caffeine**.

* The chemical substance in alcohol that affects our body is ethanol. Excessive ethanol consumption can lead to intoxication and diseases.
* Ethanol acts on the central nervous system, and its effect may depend on the amount consumed, the context, and the individual characteristics of the consumer.
* Caffeine is a psychoactive substance that has the ability to trick your brain into feeling more awake and focused.
* Caffeine works by blocking adenosine, which communicates to your brain that it is time to relax.
* With adenosine out of play, caffeine allows other brain chemicals to take over, providing energy and mental clarity.

In the neon sprawl of Night City, Isa Torres has built her life on a lie. Once a punk from the streets of Heywood, she hacked her way into Biotechnica’s research division with a forged degree and a spotless record. For six years she’s kept her head down, quietly researching neural implants for the city’s elite. Then one experiment goes too far, uncovering a secret that the city’s most powerful players would kill to protect. Now Isa must choose between the lie that saved her life and the truth that could end it.

# Chapter 6 - The Space Between

Isa let the door hiss shut behind her and dropped her keys into the tray without looking. The lights came on automatically, flooding the apartment in soft, neutral white. No music, no monitor hum. Just quiet.

She stood there for a moment, fingers still on the edge of the counter. The relief from earlier had worn off. Now there was just the apartment, the silence, the badge on the table.

She moved without thinking. Blazer off, fridge open. Nothing but ration packs, a half-drunk electrolyte bulb, and some expired synth-protein. She closed it again. Kicked off her heels. Started toward the shower, then stopped halfway.

She sat on the edge of the couch instead.

The badge gleamed under the lamp. Corporate silver. She'd worked years for that—lied her way through credentials, forged transcripts, clawed out of Heywood into something legitimate.

Except it wasn't legitimate, was it?

Marek's voice echoed in her head. *Strategic memory management.* Not healthcare. Surveillance. Tracking what executives knew. Timestamping their thoughts. Turning minds into evidence.

She'd thought Biotechnica was the exit. The way out of running packages for the Valentinos, of looking over her shoulder, of being owned. But sitting here now, it felt the same. Different suit. Same trap.

Her terminal sat on the coffee table. She pulled it into her lap and opened the Biotechnica dashboard. Patient files blinked up. Her cursor drifted toward Mrs. Santos's name.

The old woman's story had changed. Not drifted—*changed*. She'd remembered her grandson's birthday one way during one visit, then described it differently the next time, like it hadn't happened yet. And both logs were clean. Both timestamps matched.

She closed the file before she could spiral. One tab over, her encrypted contacts glowed. Arthur was online. 

She hesitated, then typed: *You up?*

Instant reply: *Is this a therapy call or a catch-up call? I charge extra for therapy.*

She smiled and hit connect.

Arthur’s face appeared onscreen, lit by the soft blue of half a dozen mismatched monitors. He looked exactly the same: hoodie, scruffy jaw, hair slightly longer than last time. A white-and-orange cat padded across the desk behind him, paused to sniff something, then disappeared.

He wasn't a flashy runner. Never had been. Arthur was the kind of quiet genius who could break through a triple-encrypted shard while making tea, then disappear without a trace. He’d helped Isa forge her NCU degree, fabricate every digital trail she needed, and scrub the metadata so clean even Biotechnica’s audit AI hadn’t flagged a thing.

He was a chairjock, tucked away in a converted utility basement somewhere on the eastern edge of the Glen—underground in every sense. After a few high-profile gigs in his early twenties, Arthur had gone quiet, slipping off the radar to avoid the wrong kind of attention. Now he kept things low-key: freelance security audits, patch jobs for people he trusted, no flashy raids or corps breathing down his neck.

It didn’t make sense—not on paper. But somehow, this half-feral tech monk with a cat in his wires and dust in his tea filters was still the person she trusted most.

His eyes scanned her face. ""So,"" he said, leaning back. ""Biotechnica’s star researcher. You callin’ because you miss me, or because the implant turned someone into a pineapple?""

""It’s Friday,"" she said. ""Don’t make me regret this.""

He held up both hands. ""No regrets. Just curiosity. You look like someone who spent the last six months sprinting and just realized she’s not being chased anymore.""

Isa leaned back. ""That obvious?""

""Only to someone who knows what your real face looks like.""

She didn’t answer. Not right away. He didn’t press.

Instead, he leaned back with a slight grin—the kind that meant he was about to bring up something embarrassing.

""You remember that karaoke bar in Santo Domingo?""

Isa groaned. ""Don’t.""

""I’m just saying, that was the last time I saw you actually have fun.""

""You dragged me onstage.""

""You say 'dragged' like you didn’t take the mic and belt out that Lizzy Wizzy cover like your life depended on it.""

""I was drunk.""

""You were incredible. And drunk. But mostly incredible.""

She laughed. The memory surfaced: the cramped room, the stuttering neon, Arthur crooning into a cracked microphone with zero shame. He'd made her do a duet. It was ridiculous. One of the last times she remembered letting herself be stupid on purpose.

She shook her head. ""We were disasters.""

""Speak for yourself. I was thriving.""

The tension thinned. Her shoulders dropped. And for the first time all week, she wasn’t thinking about timelines or metrics.

""I don’t know what to do with myself when it’s quiet,"" she admitted.

Arthur tilted his head. ""Then don’t do anything. That’s the point.""

""You make it sound easy.""

""It’s not,"" he said. ""Took me years to figure out I didn’t have to keep proving I deserved to breathe.""

She studied him for a moment. Hoodie pulled low, posture relaxed, some kind of tea steaming in a chipped mug by his elbow. He wasn’t pretending to be calm. He just was.

""How do you do it?"" she asked. ""Just… coast?""

He shrugged. ""You stop tying your worth to the panic. Most people I know—especially the smart ones—only know how to function when they’re bleeding out emotionally. You? You got real good at performing stability. But performing isn’t being.""

Isa let her head drop back against the couch. ""Jesus. You sure you’re not the one charging for therapy?""

""I said I charge extra,"" he deadpanned.

She closed her eyes for a second. Let the quiet sit. It wasn’t comfortable. But with Arthur, it didn’t feel threatening.

When she opened them, she realized how much she’d been talking. How much he hadn’t.

""What about you?"" she asked. ""How’ve you been?""

He smiled, slow and crooked. ""Honestly? Not bad. Picked up a job for some indie crew trying to build an anonymous ride-share network. Real quiet gig—mostly sandbox testing, signal masking, nothing exciting. But clean. No suits breathing down my neck.""

He leaned back, stretching, and continued, ""Did some work on a crypto archive tool for a historian out in Pacifica—paid in old rare vinyl and a bottle of homebrew whiskey. Weirdly fair trade.""

Isa raised an eyebrow. ""That sounds... actually kind of nice.""

""It is,"" he said. ""I don’t take big contracts anymore. Just what fits. Got a few long-term clients who pay me to keep their systems from imploding. I poke around, fix things, try not to get shot.""

He reached for the mug by his elbow. Steam curled upward. ""Spent the rest of the week teaching a plant to blink Morse code.""

""A plant.""

""They say talking to them helps. I figured, why not let them talk back.""

Isa blinked. ""Wait—plants can speak in Morse code?""

Arthur smirked. ""Not really. I rigged a sensor to the leaves. Tracks moisture levels, slight movements. When it’s thirsty or overstimulated, the light pulses. I mapped the patterns to dots and dashes. Total nonsense. But it calms me down.""

He turned his monitor a few degrees. In the corner, a spindly potted vine sat on a shelf beside a node relay, one leaf twitching under a motion sensor. A tiny blue light blinked slowly beside it.

""She’s shy around strangers,"" he added.

She snorted. ""You’re a freak.""

""And you called me.""

A pause. Then:

""Come over,"" Arthur said. ""You look like you need to breathe something other than filtered air.""

The Glen still pulsed after midnight—graffiti-stained buildings, underpass markets, flophouse diners that never turned off their lights. Isa parked two blocks from Arthur’s hideout and walked the rest. His space was under a decommissioned metroline spur, accessible through an old security door covered in rust and stickers.

She hesitated at the door. Then knocked.

Arthur let her in like he’d been expecting her all week. Inside: warm light, salvage furniture, tech guts everywhere. Vines curled around broken drones. A kettle hissed on a heating coil.

They sat on the floor and ate street-cart noodles with synthetic pork and red chilies. Isa coughed on the spice. Arthur smirked and handed her a bottle of cold soymilk.

Isa picked at the edge of her takeout box, then looked up. “You ever miss it? Just… driving. Stealing some junker, riding all night, no destination?”

Arthur leaned back, smiled. “You mean when we were broke, bored, and convinced we were untouchable? Every damn day.”

Isa stood, grabbing her jacket. “Let’s go.”

Arthur tossed her the keys. “Try not to judge my ride too hard. She’s got more stealth mods than paint.”

Later, they got in his car—a custom-mod patched-together beast, all engine and grit, with a cracked nav display and a glovebox that didn’t close right. Arthur drove them through the heart of Mechatronics—rusted cranes, busted servobot arms, heaps of gutted cars stacked like scrap pyramids. The sky was hazy with industrial residue.

From there, they climbed the sloping roads past the old freight yard near Northside, scattered with shipping crates no one had moved in years. The air thinned. Fewer pedestrians. Isa watched the lights flicker past.

As they crossed into an old industrial zone near Watson, Isa heard it: the buzz of a drone, low and persistent.

""Eyes on us,"" she said quietly.

Yeah,"" Arthur replied, eyes on the mirrors. He flipped a switch under the dash. A pulse of static surged.

The drone veered and stuttered, then vanished upward like it forgot what it was doing.

""That legal?"" Isa asked.

""It didn’t ask permission either.""

She stared out the window. ""You ever think they’re watching me?""

""They watch everyone,"" he said. ""Just not equally.""

They wound their way up to a scenic overlook in the hills above North Oak—a quiet, elevated strip once meant for luxury AV tours, now mostly abandoned except for the occasional bike gang or couple looking for privacy. The guardrails were corroded, but the view was unbeatable.

Below them, Night City spread out in flickering constellations. Corpo Plaza gleamed sharpest, a wedge of surgical steel and shifting holograms. The rest blurred out—Heywood’s amber glow, Pacifica’s spotty grids, Watson’s dense sprawl folding into darkness. Isa stepped out and leaned on the railing. 

""It's not much,"" Arthur said. ""But at least it's honest. Can't say that about your boardroom.""

Isa said nothing, just watched the digital billboards pulse. Below that skyline was everything she’d fought so hard to belong to. And none of it looked real from up here.

Later, back at Arthur’s, she stood by the window. Rain fell in thin sheets across the metroline. She thought about telling him everything—about Mrs. Santos, about the glitch, about the dread she couldn’t shake.

She opened her mouth, then closed it again.

If she said it out loud, it wouldn’t be just a hunch anymore. It would be real.

And if Arthur believed her, he’d dig. He’d help.

That was the problem.

She wasn’t ready to pull him into it. Not yet. Not while she was still pretending it might go away.

""If everything fell apart,"" she said instead, ""would you still help me?""

Arthur looked up. ""Yeah. But I won’t watch you burn yourself down first.""

She left before sunrise. The Glen was quieter now. The sky was going gray at the edges.

The knot in her chest had finally unraveled. The quiet didn’t feel hostile anymore. Just still.

The drive home was quiet. The roads mostly empty, the city just beginning to stretch into morning. By the time Isa reached her building, the sky was going pale.

She slipped inside, dropped her bag by the door, and didn’t bother turning on the lights.

She went to bed without changing.

As she lay there, the city humming outside her window, she thought about Arthur’s plant—blinking its slow, silent code into the dark.

# Chapter 7 - The Patient

The address wasn’t in any official registry. Isa had to cross-reference internal delivery logs and patient access waivers to find it—buried under a flagged profile with a hand-written note: ""Prefers home visits. Prone to agitation.""

Mateo Alvarez. Age 47. Discharged from the NUSA Army with long-term memory degradation. One of the earliest MNEM-04 trial subjects. His file was suspiciously thin.

The ride out to Rancho Coronado felt longer than usual. Isa was off the clock, dressed casually—technically not supposed to be doing any patient visits on a weekend. But she was curious, and the curiosity made her drive faster.

Mateo’s house sat behind a chain-link fence curling with rust. A camo tarp flapped against a broken patio post. She knocked twice, then again.

""I said no solicitors,"" a voice barked. ""And no fucking preachers.""

""Mateo? It’s Isa Torres. I’m with Biotechnica. Just checking in. You’ve missed your last two response windows.""

A long pause. Something shifted behind the curtain. Then a series of clicks.

The door creaked open.

Mateo looked thinner than his ID photo. Grayer. His beard was patchy and unkempt. A pistol hung loosely at his side, not pointed at her, but not holstered either.

""Wasn’t expecting anyone.""

""I didn’t schedule. Just came by. Off the record.""

His eyes narrowed. He stepped aside. Isa entered slowly.

Inside, the place was dim. Bottles lined the windowsill. A tangle of cords spilled from the wall—sensor override, maybe. A dog barked from a neighboring unit.

""Sit,"" Mateo said. Not an offer.

Isa took the folding chair. He paced.

""I know why you’re here,"" he said. ""You want to know if it’s working.""

""I want to make sure you’re okay.""

He barked a laugh. ""Nobody’s okay. But you’re late. The damage is already done.""

""You’ve been experiencing memory irregularities?""

Mateo stared at her, then turned and rummaged on a bookshelf. He dropped a thick notebook on the table—pages ragged, stained, covered in looping handwriting.

""This is all the shit I can’t remember. Written down before it slips.""

Isa flipped through it. There were notes—times, dates, names—but half the pages just said things like *who is Rosa?* or *I keep waking up with different bruises.* Some lines were crossed out, others circled aggressively. Toward the back: *There was a woman. Blonde. Girlfriend?*

Isa looked down at the notebook, then back at Mateo. Her mouth opened like she might say something—but nothing came. There was no defense left. She closed the notebook. ""Yeah,"" she said. ""It's worse than I thought.""

Mateo pulled the pistol from his belt and set it on the table. Her breath caught, but he didn’t aim it. Just rested his hand on the grip.

""You remember the war?"" he asked.

She nodded. ""Too well.""

The Unification War had started in 2069, when she was still in high school—Militech backing the NUSA, Arasaka backing the Free States. Night City declared itself neutral, and the fighting never reached them. But the war was always on the news, like a bad signal from another world. Isa remembered watching the footage anyway—blockades, drone strikes, hordes of refugees—and wondering how far away safety really was.

""Mateo... you were there?""

He nodded. ""Second Battalion. Eastern front.""

""Back then, at least you knew where the trauma came from. You lived with it. Worked around it. This shit? This is worse. It's like they're rearranging the walls of your mind and pretending it's still your house.""

""You’re not being erased, Mateo. You’re being monitored. Carefully.""

""Bullshit.""

He stood abruptly and began pacing.

""I wrote something down two days ago. It's gone. Not in the notebook. Not in my slate. Not in my head. I’m scared to sleep, 'cause I wake up missing pieces. And I know, I *know*, I signed the waiver. But that was before it started eating me.""

Isa felt sweat bead under her collar.

""Mateo, I believe you. I do. Let me bring this up the chain. I’ll fight for a halt in your case—""

""I already halted it.""

He lifted the gun again. This time toward himself.

""Hey, hey—put it down,"" Isa said, standing slowly. ""I’m sure there’s a way to fix this.""

""That makes one of us.""

He stared at her, breathing hard. Then he slowly lowered the gun, sitting again.

Isa stayed standing. ""You need help. Not just from Biotechnica. From someone real.""

""Got a line on that?""

She didn’t.

They sat in silence. Long enough that her legs started to ache. She finally stepped forward and gently reached for the notebook.

""Can I take this? I want to help.""

Mateo hesitated, then nodded.

She turned to leave.

""Hey,"" he said. ""You seem like one of the good ones. But even good ones get used. Don’t forget that.""

Isa paused in the doorway.

Then she walked out.

She was halfway down the drive when the gunshot cracked behind her.

She didn’t cry until the car doors closed.

She got home late and didn't turn on the lights. Her apartment felt sterile, alien. She tossed Mateo's notebook on the counter and stared at it for a long time.

Then her slate buzzed.

**Unknown Caller – Encrypted Signal**

She hesitated. Accepted.

""Miss Torres,"" said a clipped, female voice. ""I have information about Gabriela Torres that you will want to know.""

Isa froze. “What? My mom? Who is this?”

""My name is Wakako Okada. We should speak. In person. It concerns your mother.""

Japantown glowed like a fever dream---bright lanterns, humid smoke, too many bodies in too little space. Isa ducked into the parlor Wakako operated from: cool air, paper walls, red cushions.

Consider: Wakako Okada sat in a velvet armchair, her expression unreadable save for the faint curve at the corner of her mouth.

Fixer. Power broker. Queen of Japantown. Wakako had built an empire out of silence and leverage—secrets traded like currency, favors wrapped in thin veils of civility. She dealt in information, influence, and the kind of protection that didn’t come cheap. If the Tyger Claws gang was the steel spine of the district, Wakako was its velvet glove.

“You look like her,” she said. “But harder.”

“What do you know about my mother?”

Wakako poured tea without offering any.

“She was brave. And foolish. She was going to go to the NCPD with what she knew.”

""About what?""

""The Valentinos. Blackmail, extortion, contract hits. Your mother found out because of your father. They pulled him in first—small favors, then bigger ones. She was trying to get him out, both of you. Going to the NCPD with names, payment records—proof. She thought exposing it would make a difference.""

""They killed her.""

Wakako nodded. ""And they warned your father. Stay quiet, or lose your daughter too.""

Isa sat slowly. She felt brittle, fragile in a way she hadn't since childhood.

""Why now? Why are you telling me this?""

""Because you’re not a child anymore. And because I want to offer you a trade.""

She slid a small shard case across the table.

""Bring this to Biotechnica. Insert the shard in your terminal. Discreet. Then return it to me. Do this, and I make the debt disappear. No more Valentinos. For you or your father.""

Isa stared at the case.

""What’s on it?""

""Not your concern.""

""It is if it comes back to me.""

Wakako tilted her head. ""Don’t pretend you’re clean. You broke laws getting into that ivory tower. Why stop now?""

Isa looked at the shard again.

""Fine, I’ll do it.""

""Good girl.""

Wakako smiled. Isa didn't smile back.

# Chapter 8 – The Upload

Monday morning arrived too soon. Isa hovered outside the Biotechnica tower for a long time, watching the corporate shuttles glide down in perfect rows.

Her fingers found the shard in her pocket. She could feel the heat of it, or maybe that was just her nerves. One last job, then out.

She swiped her badge and stepped onto the 66th floor.

She was early. Priya and Jade hadn't arrived yet. Isa sat down at her desk and let the quiet wash over her. She scrolled idly through her files until a patient’s name caught her eye. She stopped and stared at it.

Mateo Alvarez. The name felt like a wound that hadn't healed. She could still see his eyes, hear the desperation in his voice, feel the weight of the notebook he'd pressed into her hands. Hear the crack of the gunshot.

What was she doing here? Playing the good employee while Biotechnica smoothed the edges and buried the bodies—launching a product that was already killing people? If she stayed quiet, she was complicit. If she acted, she risked everything—her job, her father, the fragile cover story she’d built her whole career on.

She thought of Mateo. The notebook full of desperate scribbling. The gunshot she'd heard from his driveway. He'd known something was wrong with MNEM-04, known it was erasing him—and she'd walked away.

Her hand drifted to her pocket. The shard pressed against her palm like a decision waiting to be made.

*Screw it,* she thought. *Biotechnica deserves whatever this is.*

No one was watching. The floor was quiet, half-empty. She turned slightly and slid the shard into the port beneath her desk.

No prompts, no passwords. Just a small red light blinking. 

A minute passed, then two. 

The light went green.

She yanked the shard out, wiped it on her sleeve, and tucked it back into her jacket. Done.

The rest of the day passed in a surreal blur—meetings, metrics, compliance briefs. Everyone talking like the launch was already written into law.

By 7:00 PM, Isa had finally clocked out and left the office, heading to Wakako's. The shard sat in her jacket pocket, a constant weight. 

She tried not to think about what would happen if they caught her.

Her grip on the wheel relaxed slightly. Almost done—one last drop, then she and her dad could finally breathe again. Get out of Night City. Maybe start over.

She crossed the bridge into Japantown and began winding her way through the neon-splashed streets.

Then the dashboard flickered.

The car's acceleration spiked—hard and immediate. Like someone had slammed the pedal from the passenger side.

""No no no,"" she muttered, jerking the wheel. ""Override. Manual—""

The steering locked. The dashboard flashed: Driver Assist Locked.

The car surged again, this time veering toward a side rail. A rusted guardrail blurred past. She hit the brake—nothing. The seatbelt bit into her shoulder as the car swerved.

The impact was sharp. Metal shrieked. Her forehead clipped the side panel hard enough to blur her vision. She tasted blood.

The car careened off the road, over the sidewalk, and slammed into the side of a brick building with a sickening crunch.

The world stopped.

Smoke hissed from the hood. The airbag hadn’t deployed, and her ears were ringing.

Isa clawed at the door and kicked it open, half-stumbling into the cool night air. She pressed a hand to her temple—wet, sticky.

She looked around—no one. No pursuers, no drones overhead.

The airbag should have deployed. It hadn't. Someone had made sure of that. 

She ran.

A quarter mile up the road, she flagged down a Delamain cab.

She slid into the seat, heart hammering. Maybe Biotechnica had found out she'd stolen data—and triggered a remote override to make a point.

The interior was calm. The cabin lights glowed soft blue, and the synthetic leather seats adjusted subtly as she sat.

Delamain's digital face appeared on the screen, crisp and professional.

""You appear distressed,"" the AI said. Polite, British inflection. “Do you need medical assistance?”

Isa didn’t answer at first. The world still felt a half-second out of sync. Her ears rang from the crash. Her head ached where it had struck the panel. And the heat in her jacket—the shard—felt like a live fuse.

""No,"" she said finally. ""Just take me to Japantown. Fast.""

""Very well.""

She sank into the seat. Delamain's smooth driving contrasted jarringly with the chaos she’d just escaped. Neon blurs swept past the window. She closed her eyes.

""My car,"" she murmured. ""It veered off the road. Locked the controls. Couldn’t steer.""

""How did the controls respond prior to the incident?"" Delamain asked. ""Were there any alerts? External signals?""

Isa hesitated. ""The dash blinked. Then it accelerated. Locked the wheel.""

""Curious,"" Delamain said. ""That suggests either a systems breach or catastrophic malfunction.""

Isa’s eyes flicked to the mirror. ""Can you tell if anyone's tracking me?""

""Scanning... No pursuit vehicles identified. No geolocation beacons active on your person.""

Isa didn’t feel reassured.

""Just keep an eye out,"" she whispered, opening her eyes again. The streetlights ahead glittered like glass. ""And get me to Japantown.""

Wakako's parlor felt like stepping onto a different planet, incense curling from iron bowls in slow, deliberate spirals.

Wakako raised one brow as Isa entered. Her eyes flicked to the blood on Isa's temple

""Isa. I was not expecting you.""

Isa stared at her, not moving. Her head pounded in sync with her heartbeat.

“You said this job was clean. Quick. In and out. You didn't mention Biotechnica trying to kill me.""

Wakako didn’t blink. ""And yet, here you are.""

Isa stepped farther into the room, voice low and tight. ""My car locked me out and tried to run me off the road. If I hadn’t jumped, I’d be dead. What the fuck did you get me into?""

""What you asked for,"" Wakako said. ""Freedom. From Heywood. From the Valentinos. From a past that was dragging you under.""

""Yeah, well, maybe now I need protection from my employer too.”

Wakako studied her for a long moment. Then tapped a command on the panel beside her. A Tyger Claw stepped into view—young, serious, eyes sharp.

""This is Kazuo. He'll take you somewhere safe.""

Isa blinked. ""The Tyger Claws?""

""They protect my interests, which now includes you.”

Isa had heard the stories—the Tyger Claws ran Japantown with ruthless precision. Their style was clean but lethal: katanas and smartguns, lacquered motorcycles and blood-stained elegance. Not the kind of people you crossed casually. Not the kind you usually walked away from.

Kazuo stepped forward, one hand resting on his katana's hilt. ""We can leave now.""

Isa shook her head. ""Not yet. My dad. I need to get him first. If Biotechnica found out, they might come after him too. I’m not leaving him alone.""

Wakako didn’t argue. ""Fine. Go.""

Her father answered the door in an old t-shirt and tool-stained jeans. One look at her face and he stepped aside without a word.

""Pack a bag. Now.""

""What happened?""

She leaned against the wall, dizzy for a second. ""My car tried to kill me.""

He stilled. ""What?""

""Remote override. Biotechnica maybe. I don’t know yet. But it wasn’t an accident.""

""Jesus, Isa—""

""Please. Just—pack a bag. I’ll explain on the way.""

The Tyger Claw drove the compact sportscar in silence. Isa, her father, and his bags sat crammed together in the back seat.

She told him everything. The shard. Wakako. The truth about her mother. The Valentinos’ threat. The deal she’d made.

Javier didn’t interrupt. Not until she finally ran out of words.

""You did all this without telling me.""

""I was trying to protect you.""

""You think this is protection? Trading one leash for another?""

Isa’s fingers curled around the seatbelt strap. ""We weren’t safe before. We’re not safe now. But at least this time, someone’s offering protection.""

""Someone with a better suit. That’s all.""

She looked away. ""I don’t know what else to do.""

He didn’t answer. Just stared out the window, jaw tight.

The safehouse was a converted restaurant near the docks. Reinforced windows. No wireless signal. A Tyger Claw outside the door.

Isa sat on the edge of the cot, her legs trembling.

She’d done it. She was supposed to be safe now.

So why did it feel like she’d just pulled the pin on a grenade?",1,1762495556.0,cyberpunkgame,0,1.0,False

I am sooooo sick of people from work mocking me for not eating any of the garbage they are always passing around or bringing in. They act passive aggressive and or sarcastic & I’m just tired of it. Go eat your brownies and doughnuts and chips and sodas and candy. I don’t want it or the pizza the boss buys or the sugar filled coffee they offer to buy me. “No thank you” is never enough. 

The HR lady today gave me beef jerky sticks and it has carbs and sugar in it so I just thanked her and stuffed it in a bag. “Yum! Ill eat it later!” Then HR lady offered me halloween candy - Reese’s pieces & I said “no thank you” “oh! Are you allergic to nuts?”  “No I just am refraining from carbs and sugar” “why” (in a really winey and sarcastic tone)  

So, today I decided to sit in her office and described to her how I had blood in my shit and then a colon infection and polyp removal and diverticulitis and I talked like it was a college lecture.  describing every little tiny disgusting detail.

 “Man explaining” and over sharing. I could see how uncomfortable it makes her and other as I now have started to do this. I had a manager that is a vegetarian and he tried to explain to me how I need carbs and sugar for my brain to function properly… again, the lecture of the bloody stool and the polyps and the avoiding getting 18 inches of my bowels removed and avoiding surgery..

The thing is- I already have tried to tell her and my manager “no thank you. i have been watching my carbs and sugar” and I have already been ridiculed. We have already had these conversations. They love to play dumb and pretend like I’ve never told them this. It’s like a challenge to see if they can wear me down.

It’s like going out with drunks that keep telling you to drink more drink more even when you tell them you’re done drinking for the night because you know you’re gonna throw up. 

Every time someone wants to share their sage wisdom about my diet and what I should be putting in my own body is now going to get the bloody shit and polyps followed by no diverticulitis and only two less than 1 mm polyps on my next colonoscopy story. 

Their fake concern for me and pathological need to educate and mock me has caused me to tell my juicy story to them. 

I lost 78 pounds and feel great. I poop regularly any there is never blood or pain. I don’t get gas and anal leaking. And IBS and cramps…

FU normal people who eat what ever.. i don’t lecture you about how the candy can fk up your pancreas and you’ll get diabetes and have to get your leg chopped off… stop talking about my “brain not getting sugar and carbs” my brain works great. I feel clean. I feel clear minded. 

When I do cheat meals like going out to eat with my gf, I feel mentally foggy & get bowel issues.

i’ve made so much progress and i’m so proud of myself for always choosing to push forward another day. only three years ago, i was anorexic, agoraphobic, severely depressed and anxious, unable to sleep/function/live properly… i was completely isolated from the world, in mild psychosis, and had just experienced a severe traumatic event. i was abusing medications and engaging in every harmful coping mechanism you can think of. i was scared, sad, exhausted, and hungry- all day, every day.

fast forward to today… i’m twenty, living independently in a place of my own that i share with my closest friends. we go out on weekends and chat about our night in the morning over coffee. i cook balanced meals and eat without guilt. i’m slowly weaning myself off smoking, i’m no longer in a stressful relationship, i have an internship and am on the path to get my degree early and on top of that… i can leave my house!! i can sleep at night!! i smile and laugh and play and joke around!! this life feels like a dream to me!!

sometimes being alive is hard. even though i’m in a much better place, i still struggle, and it can feel incredibly defeating. but i look back now and realize that so much has changed in a few years. i’m so grateful to be alive. i’m so glad i never gave up. thank you, seventeen year old me! we made it :)",2,1762495261.0,CongratsLikeImFive,0,1.0,False

I’m a 5’5” curvy woman who has a monochromatic wardrobe. I have a couple of degrees and a job that is demanding but very rewarding. In my free time, I like going to concerts, going on short trips, drinking good coffee, and going on walks in nature. I also really like botanical gardens, aquariums, and museums. I would love to meet someone who is down to take little trips to explore the amazing places we have available to us in California, especially nearby!

I like artsy movies but don't necessarily expect you to care for them. I listen to a lot of music, but most recently I've been listening to post-punk, new wave, and shoegaze. I really enjoy discovering new music and am typically pretty open-minded about checking out any recommendations that I get.

I'm pretty independent, but I am hoping to meet someone I'm compatible with so that we can ""do life"" together. I want to meet someone who is excited to go to concerts together, or check out the newest cafe. Heck, it doesn't even have to be a new cafe, it could be your favorite spot that you never tire of. I really want to travel more, and would like to meet a guy who wants to share new and exciting experiences with someone else.

I am hoping to meet someone who is emotionally available and mature, who can communicate their needs and who knows what they want in life. I do think it’s important to note that I am politically progressive and I’ve found that this is important in my personal relationships. If you do not make it a habit to watch or read the news, we probably aren’t going to be on the same page about this. It’s incredibly important to me that I can connect with people who are equally curious about the world, and I would hope this is important to you as well.

I am strictly monogamous, and ask that if you are interested in a romantic relationship you are completely untethered (legally single) and are in a place in your life where you would like to invest your time in nurturing a healthy relationship. It’s important to take our time getting to know one another, but I’d prefer to spend my time with someone who is at the same place in life and who is ready to settle down.

Simply put, I'm currently living a full life and doing my own thing but I'd like to do life together because I believe that partnership is an important aspect of life.

If this sounds interesting to you, shoot me a message and we can chat more about it. Please note that I’m not looking for a pen pal at this time.",0,1762495211.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

\-------------------

# Chapter 3 - The Trap You Know

Isa sat in her car in the Biotechnica garage for a long time, engine off, hands gripping the wheel.

*Strategic memory management.*

Marek's words circled in her head like vultures. Not a medical device. A corporate leash. A way to turn employees into walking evidence logs—every conversation, every document, every stray thought timestamped and traceable.

She'd known MNEM-04 trial data was too clean, the pressure too intense. But she'd told herself it was just corporate optimism. Aggressive timelines. The usual corner-cutting.

Not this.

Not a surveillance system disguised as healthcare.

She thought about Mrs. Santos, smiling as she talked about remembering her grandson's name. About all the other patients who'd signed up thinking they were getting their minds back—not knowing they were handing them over.

Her stomach twisted.

She started the engine. The dashboard lit up, casting her face in pale blue light.

Security clearance. Background checks. Erik's warning about her father's records.

If someone pulled her file now—really pulled it—what would they find? Her forged transcripts? The Valentino connections? The jobs she'd run before clawing her way into this tower?

Biotechnica didn't do anything casually. If they were digging into her background, it meant someone was already suspicious. And if MNEM-04 really did what Marek claimed—tracking what people knew and when they knew it—then how long before they turned it inward? Before every employee became a potential liability to be monitored, managed, controlled?

She could feel the walls closing in.

There were too many pieces of her past scattered across the city like broken glass. So much she'd buried. So much she couldn't risk anyone digging up.

But tonight, she was going back.

Dinner at her father's. She was already late.

She gripped the wheel tighter than necessary and pulled out of the garage into the thick haze of Night City. Behind her, the smooth hum of the garage door sealed shut, leaving the clinical sterility of her workday behind.

She should have felt relief. Instead, her mind was spinning.

The drive south peeled away layers of illusion with every mile. The city shifted slowly at first—the buildings less polished, the sidewalks less even. Then came the flickering lights, the half-tagged walls, the soft bass hum of music vibrating through concrete. Heywood hadn’t changed. If anything, it had hardened into itself. Like it had stopped pretending it would ever be anything else.

Javier’s garage was still tucked into the corner lot near the scrapyard. The roll-up door was half-open, light spilling out in a warm slant over cracked pavement. Isa parked a few spots down and approached on foot, careful to keep her heels from catching in the uneven concrete.

Inside, her father was elbow-deep in the guts of a rust-red sedan, half its parts spread out on folding tables. He didn’t look up when she entered. Just said, ""You're late.""

""Nice to see you too,"" Isa replied.

He smirked, wiped his hands on a rag, and finally turned. Time had deepened the lines on his face, put a limp in his stride, but the set of his jaw was the same. So was the look in his eyes—half wary, half relieved.

They talked shop for a while. Easier that way. The car he was fixing belonged to a neighbor. The alternator was junk, but he’d salvaged one from a wreck two lots over. Isa half-listened, half-watched the way his hands moved, still precise despite the tremor she wasn’t supposed to notice.

Dinner was rehydrated beans and grilled cheese sandwiches from a real stovetop. They sat across from each other at the small kitchen table, a faded vinyl tablecloth between them, the air heavy with the scent of grease and something vaguely metallic.

Isa picked at her plate, then glanced toward the darkened windows. ""How has the shop been lately? Lot of people dropping by?""

Javier shrugged without looking up. ""Busy neighborhood. People need things.""

She kept pulling the thread. ""Any unwelcome guests?""

He sighed, sat back in his chair. ""Not more than usual. Just feels louder sometimes.""

""Dad.""

""Yeah. They drop by. Few familiar faces. Few new ones. All polite.""

Isa frowned. That was worse. ""Polite"" in Heywood meant they didn’t need to threaten you.

He looked over at her, studied her for a moment. ""I’m fine, mija.""

She didn’t believe him.

It hadn’t stopped—not since that night, years ago, when a Valentino job went sideways and two gang members landed on his doorstep bleeding and desperate. One kid shot in the gut, one jittery lieutenant trying to keep it together, and a wrecked car that wouldn’t survive five minutes under police scan. Javier hadn’t hesitated. Pulled the bullet, scrubbed the black box, rewired the ignition. No questions. No noise. Just silence and grease and an unspoken agreement that this had never happened.

The Valentinos were one of the largest and most feared gangs in Night City. Their saints-and-rosaries aesthetic masked extortion, trafficking, and blackmail. And they’d decided Javier Torres was useful.

The next morning, they brought him cafecito. Smiled. Called him family.

From then on, he was theirs. Not flashy. Not bloody. Just the quiet kind of useful they didn’t let go. And he’d let it happen. It was easier – and safer – than trying to resist and keep his hands clean.

She hated that she understood.

A silence settled between them as they ate. Isa looked across the table and studied her father’s face—the lines that had deepened since she was a girl, the gray spreading through his hair, the way his shoulders curved slightly forward like he was carrying something too heavy for too long.

He was lonely, even if he’d never say it. And Isa didn’t have enough dinners with him to chase it away.

Her chest tightened.

""I wish Mom were here,"" she said quietly.

Javier didn’t look up from his plate. But after a long pause, he said, ""Me too.""

Another moment passed.

Then he added, more softly, ""But she would be proud of you.""

Isa looked down, blinking fast.

""She wanted you out of here. That much I know. She was always looking for exits. You found one, you got that job. She’d have respected that.""

He stood and started clearing the plates, his back to her.

“You got out, mija. Don’t waste it.”

After dinner, Javier stepped out back to smoke, leaving the garage door propped open behind him. Isa wandered into the workspace, trailing her fingers along the old tool bench. The garage felt unchanged—cluttered but orderly, its familiar smell a mix of rust, oil, and old wires. It was the closest thing she had to a childhood home.

She paused by the old metal cabinet. A faded photo was still taped to the front: her and Riz, arms slung around each other’s shoulders, flanked by Ayo, and Juno. They were laughing, grinning, grease-streaked and sunburnt—posed in front of a half-dismantled Thorton that they’d somehow gotten running again for a street race that night.

It was taken in better days.

The memory hit hard.

She was twenty. A few weeks since she'd dropped out of Night City University, though she hadn't told anyone yet. Said she was taking a break. Said she’d come back next semester for her junior year. 

That night, she’d been crouched behind a half-built car at the edge of the scrapyard, waiting for her contact—some Valentino runner she barely knew, sent by a mutual friend who said she was “smart, quiet, and needed cash.” The guy showed late, eyes scanning the shadows like he was already halfway to regret. No names. No pleasantries. Just a sealed courier case shoved into her hands.

“No questions,” he said, and turned to leave.

The case was heavier than she expected—cold, like it had been refrigerated. She didn’t ask what was in it. She didn’t want to know. She slipped it into her backpack, walked three blocks south, and left it behind a dumpster tagged with a yellow V.

The next morning, she found a credstick tucked into her locker at the corner gym where she worked front desk. No message. Just enough eddies to cover two months of rent.

She told herself it was a one-time thing.

She never told her father. She didn’t need to.

Her eyes lingered on the photo, the edges curled and yellowing. The laughter frozen in it felt like it belonged to someone else.

A soft creak echoed from the back step.

She blinked, the weight of the memory receding like a tide. The garage came back into focus—tool bench, oil stains, the low hum of a streetlamp outside. Her father was standing in the doorway, smoke curling from between his fingers, eyes on her like he hadn’t moved at all.

They didn’t speak. Didn’t need to. The silence between them was full of things unsaid—regret, pride, warnings neither of them would voice.

Isa crossed the room and stopped in front of him. For a moment, she just stood there, unsure what to say. Then she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around him.

He didn’t hesitate. Just pulled her in, solid and warm and still smelling faintly of oil and ash. It wasn’t the kind of hug you give to prove a point. It was the kind you give because it’s the only truth left.

When she finally pulled back, she looked up at him and said, quietly, “Thanks for dinner.”

He gave a small nod. “Come by more. And be careful.”

She stepped past him, out into the cooling night. The air carried that familiar city haze—half smoke, half static. She walked back to her car, her Biotechnica badge in her pocket digging into her leg as she walked.

She slid into the driver’s seat, started the engine, and stared through the windshield for a long moment.

The towers of City Center glittered in the distance. Clean lines. Corporate gods.

She’d spent years climbing out of one life and into another. But sitting there, engine idling, she wasn’t sure where the border had been. Or if she’d ever really crossed it.

In the rearview mirror, the garage was still visible. Just barely.

As she pulled away from the curb, her father’s voice echoed. *Be careful.*

She didn’t look back.

# Chapter 4 - Six Years Ago

“Be careful,” Riz said.

The phrase hit harder than it should have. Her father's voice flickered up in her mind—not words, just a reflex. The warning he always gave. She blinked it away. Not now.

They stood in the alley outside a half-collapsed warehouse on the edge of the Glen—an old 6th Street weapons stash. 

6th Street wasn’t small-time. Ex-militia, packed with vet squads and tactical grunts who treated Night City like occupied territory. Their caches were well-stocked—implants, ammo, even prototype gear when they got lucky. And they were enemies of the Valentinos.

That mattered. Isa’s crew didn’t hit Valentino territory. Not with her dad still entangled in their quiet favors. But 6th Street? They were fair game.

Ayo had caught the tip a few days back. Word was a 6th Street squad got wiped in a power grab—left their gear behind before anyone could reclaim it. Isa had helped confirm the coordinates. Supposedly, this place held a crate of modded smartlink hardware and some untouched neural ware. High-value. Portable. Easy to fence.

There were four of them tonight: Isa, Riz with his cocky grin, Juno silent and broad-shouldered with her modded shotgun, and Ayo, twitchy and restless, always cracking jokes even when his hands shook.

“Motion sensors were fried in the blackout last month,” Ayo muttered, scanning a feed on his handheld. His knee bounced like it was running its own engine. “No heat signatures inside.”

“Still feels like a trap,” Juno said flatly. Her voice carried no nerves, only a soldier’s habit. She adjusted the strap on her shotgun.

Isa pulled her mask on. She didn't trust silence like this—the kind that came right before someone bled.

They slipped inside through a cracked service door. The place was gutted---bare rafters, scorched floor, the smell of old gunpowder still in the air. A few crates sat under a collapsed mezzanine, marked with faded gang tags.

“Spread and sweep,” Juno said.

Isa moved with Riz. They always paired up. He flashed her that crooked grin. “Bet I find something shinier than you.”

She rolled her eyes. “You always do.”

They found an unmarked crate tucked behind a steel beam. Riz popped it open—a stash of intact smartlink components, still tagged and sealed. Easily worth thousands of eddies.

“We’re good,” he said, tapping his comm. “Haul secured. Headed back.”

That's when the click echoed. Not a voice, not a machine---just the unmistakable sound of a weapon being cocked. 

A lone 6th Street holdout stepped from the shadows behind an overturned cabinet---gaunt, wild-eyed, shotgun in hand. ""Didn't say you could borrow our shit."" 

He fired.

Riz took the hit square in the chest.

Juno reacted instantly, shotgun raised. Ayo cursed, hands flying over his scanner to kill the lights. Isa dropped to her knees, screaming Riz’s name, trying to drag him behind cover as the warehouse plunged into darkness and panic.

They got out—crate in tow, blood on Isa’s hands.

By the time the van skidded to a stop in Arroyo, Riz was gone. No one spoke. Juno stared out the windshield, jaw tight. Ayo’s jokes had vanished. Isa sat alone in the back, hands still shaking.

She walked home after that. Alone. 

Her jacket hit the floor. Riz was gone. And for what? Scraps? A payout that didn't cover his life?

She lay on her back in the dark, staring at the cracked ceiling. Two years ago, she’d been at Night City University, drowning in shifts and study but still believing she could claw her way out. Then her dad got pulled in by the Valentinos. Then her mom left. She never knew why.

Now Riz was gone, shot over a box of parts. Isa was wide awake in a city that didn’t care, with blood on her hands and no way out she could afford.

She didn’t want to die like this. She didn’t want to be this.

Her eyes landed on her old terminal, still plugged in, dust thick on its screen. She crossed the room, wiped it clean, and powered it up. The screen's glow cut through the darkness. 

Night City University's login portal blinked from a forgotten tab. She stared.

It started as a thought, then became a pulse of certainty. Her fingers moved before her doubts could catch up. She pulled up old credentials, found her expired NCU student ID, her partial transcript---all still floating in the system like forgotten debris. 

It wasn't enough. She opened a secure channel and pinged the one person she knew would answer. Someone she'd helped a long time ago. Someone who owed her.

The netrunner answered on the second ring. ""What do you need?""

""A full academic history. With honors.""

A pause.

""You’re serious.""

""Dead serious.""

Within an hour, they were inside---scraping logs, fabricating access trails, creating clean metadata for class participation, message boards, exam submissions. They synthesized signatures from archived emails and financial aid records, building a version of Isa that had always existed, at least on paper.

She downloaded the new transcript. Built a resume around it. Pulled up the Biotechnica internship application. She stared at the upload button. This was it---one last heist. Only this time, she wasn't stealing from someone else. She was stealing a future. She clicked.

*Application submitted.* The confirmation screen reflected in her eyes. She shut the terminal and sat in the dark.

# Chapter 5 - Compliance Metrics

Lab 7 hummed with nervous energy—keyboards clacking, chairs scraping, low voices trading updates. Isa sat at her console, staring at the countdown display pulsing in the corner: 42 days to launch. Below it, a cluster of patient logs blinked for review—session transcripts, mood tags, system checkboxes.

She'd been at this for three hours straight. Her uploads were clean. Fully tagged, no escalations. Everything looked perfect.

Which, of course, made her nervous.

Around her, the lab buzzed with quiet intensity. Jade muttered something about timestamps at the next station over. Priya sat cross-legged on her stool, headset cables draped over her shoulder, fingers tapping across her slate.

Isa pulled up Mrs. Santos's latest session log and skimmed through it. The old woman had been doing well—no headaches, no confusion. Everything normal.

Then something caught her eye.

She opened last week's transcript side by side with today's. Read them both carefully.

The words didn't line up.

Last week, Mrs. Santos had talked about her grandson's birthday like it already happened—described the cake, the noise, the way the dog barked when they lit the candles.

But in today's session, she'd said it was coming up next Saturday. Talked about needing to find a cake without food dye, wanting one shaped like a rocket.

Isa frowned and scrolled back through both files. The tags were clean. The timeline was unchanged. But the memory had shifted.

She flagged the file, then hesitated. Un-flagged it. Opened a second file, then a third, scanning for similar inconsistencies.

Nothing jumped out. But the unease wouldn't settle.

She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples. They weren't supposed to interpret. Just record, tag, and move on. Let the data scientists figure out what it meant.

But this felt different. Too specific. Too neat.

Her stomach growled. She glanced at the time—12:47. No one had broken for lunch. Priya was still working through a protein bar. Jade survived on coffee alone.

Isa ignored her hunger and pulled up the patient access protocols instead. She needed to talk to Mrs. Santos directly. Verify what she actually remembered.

She scheduled a live session for that afternoon.

By 3 PM, Isa was logged into the secure call interface. Mrs. Santos's face blinked into view, framed by plastic-covered cushions and a crocheted blanket.

""Hola, mija,"" came the familiar rasp.

""Hi, Mrs. Santos,"" Isa said gently, forcing warmth into her voice. ""Just your usual check-in today. How are you feeling?""

""Good, good. No headaches still. The arthritis is bad, but that's nothing new.""

Isa ran through the standard questions. Mood: good. Sleep: better than last week. No confusion, no disorientation.

Then, carefully: ""And how are you feeling about your grandson's birthday?""

Mrs. Santos brightened. ""Oh, I'm so excited! It's this Saturday. I still need to find a cake without food dye—he's allergic, you know. But he wants one shaped like a rocket.""

Isa's chest tightened. She kept her expression neutral. ""That sounds wonderful. What kind of celebration are you planning?""

""Just family. His parents, my daughter, a few cousins. Nothing too big. He's turning seven, you know. Growing so fast.""

Isa nodded, typing notes with practiced efficiency. ""That's great, Mrs. Santos. I'm glad you're feeling well.""

They wrapped up the session. Standard questions, standard responses. Everything normal.

Except it wasn't.

Last week, the party had already happened. Now it was in the future.

Isa ended the call and sat staring at the blank screen.

She logged the session manually, keeping her notes clinical and brief. No mention of the discrepancy. No red flags. Just another routine check-in.

But her hands were shaking slightly as she saved the file.

She waited until the lab had mostly emptied out before approaching Erik's office. The east corridor was quiet, the overhead lights dimmed to evening mode.

Erik's office was a clean white box with a floating screen and nowhere to sit. He liked to keep meetings fast and uncomfortable.

She knocked on the doorframe. He looked up from his terminal, expression neutral.

""Torres. What do you need?""

""I had a strange result with one of my subjects,"" Isa said, stepping inside but staying near the door. ""Mrs. Santos. She remembered something differently this time. An event she talked about last week—she described it like it hadn't happened yet.""

Erik didn't look up from his screen. ""Technical error?""

""No. The files match. Both sessions logged correctly.""

He glanced up briefly, then back to his work. ""Then don't report it.""

Isa paused. ""Shouldn't we flag it for review? If there's something affecting recall accuracy—""

""Don't report it,"" he said again, his tone hardening slightly. ""It's noise. Noise brings questions. Questions bring reviews."" He finally looked at her directly. ""Do you want Legal asking why one of your recordings contradicts itself?""

She felt heat creeping up her neck. ""I just thought—""

""You're not paid to interpret. You're paid to report clean data."" He leaned back in his chair. ""A grandmother got confused about a birthday party. That's not a glitch. That's being human.""

Isa pressed her tongue to the back of her teeth. She wanted to argue. Wanted to say it felt wrong in a way she couldn't explain—too specific, too neat. But she didn't have the language for it.

Erik was quiet for a moment, his expression softening slightly. ""My mother had dementia,"" he said finally. ""She forgot who I was for the last two years. I watched it happen."" He looked at her steadily. ""MNEM could have saved her. Could save thousands like her. So yes—we clean the data. Because if we don't, none of those people get help.""

He let that sit between them.

""Let it go,"" he said. ""We're not derailing the project over a grandmother's mix-up.""

Isa shifted her weight. ""Okay.""

Erik nodded and returned to his screen. Then, almost as an afterthought: ""Oh, and Torres? Your file got pulled again after your clearance bump. Nothing serious, but something in your family history triggered a review. Vehicle registry linked to Heywood. Some old records from your father's garage.""

Her blood went cold.

He didn't look up. ""We're not looking for problems. Don't give anyone a reason to keep looking.""

She nodded stiffly. ""Understood.""

""Good. Close the door on your way out.""

Isa walked back to her station in a daze. The lab was nearly empty now—just a few people finishing up late work, screens glowing in the dim light.

She sat down and stared at her console. Three more patient files sat in her queue, waiting for review.

She opened them one by one. Scanned for anomalies. Memory slips. Inconsistencies.

Nothing obvious. But she couldn't shake the feeling that something was just under the surface, wrong in a way she couldn't quite name.

She opened a new report. Typed a sentence. Deleted it. Typed another. Deleted that too.

Finally, she closed the system and powered down her console.

She needed to think. And she couldn't do that here.

The NCART was half-empty, humming quietly through the underground tunnels. Isa leaned against the window, watching the darkness blur past punctuated by occasional station lights.

She tried to sleep but couldn't. Her mind kept circling back to Mrs. Santos. To Erik's warning. To the background check on her father.

By the time she reached her stop, exhaustion had settled into her bones like lead.

She trudged up the stairs to street level and walked the three blocks to her apartment building, barely registering the sounds of the city around her.

Inside, she kicked off her shoes, dropped her bag by the door, and collapsed onto the couch without turning on the lights.

She stared at the ceiling for a long time.

Tomorrow there was a major meeting. Something big. She could feel it in the way people had been moving through the office—the hushed conversations, the tight smiles, the nervous energy.

Whatever was coming, she wasn't ready for it.

She closed her eyes.

Sleep didn't come easy. But eventually, it came.

The next morning, Isa stepped out of the elevator on the 66th floor and into the main conference hub. The floor-to-ceiling windows were dimmed against the early light.

Teams were already assembling. Jade nudged Isa as she passed, quieter than usual. Priya followed, tucking her slate under her arm, eyes sharp with curiosity.

They slid into seats near the back. The lights dimmed. Marek’s face appeared on the main wall—sharp-boned, unsmiling, with a platinum implant strip gleaming at each temple. She didn’t waste time.

“Legal has approved trial closure,” she said. “MNEM-04 will move to market preparation.”

""Congratulations,"" Marek said. Her voice held a note of triumph.

Isa's eyes found Marius Chen from Legal across the table. He was logging something into his slate, methodical as always. His team reviewed every data point before submission.

Unless someone had buried it early.

Heat crept up her neck. She hadn't falsified anything. Not really. Just chosen not to escalate. *Just noise*, Erik had said.

Marek's voice cut back in. “Final data freeze begins this week. Manufacturing, marketing, rollout—MNEM-04 launches in 42 days. On schedule, fully approved. This is going to make Biotechnica a fortune.”

The call ended.

The room breathed.

Jade let out a sharp, stunned laugh—then quickly lowered her voice when she caught a few glances from across the room. “Holy shit,” she whispered. “We did it.”

Priya stared at the dark screen. 'This almost never happens,' she said, shaking her head. 'No pushback, no soft launch, no resubmits. Just...go.'

Jade spun halfway in her chair. “You realize we're set now, right? Priority tracks, promotions, golden project lists.”

Priya grinned. “I already know what I’m putting in my portfolio. That memory retention curve is going on the first slide.”

They both turned to Isa.

“Welcome to the big leagues,” Jade said.

Isa smiled, nodded.

*Approved.* The trial was over. They were going to market.

A strange relief swept through her—giddy, almost dizzy. Just like that—it was done. The months of pressure, of second-guessing herself, and nothing had happened. 

If nobody had flagged her fraudulent NCU degree by now, maybe they never would. She leaned back in her chair and let out a slow breath. Maybe all that worrying had been for nothing.

She leaned back in her chair and let out a slow breath.

They'd done it.

1oqmh2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeddingsPhilippines/comments/1oqmh2p/tips_from_a_graduate_bride/,Tips from a graduate bride,"Hello! I just want to give tips from a graduate bride last June. I see so many stressed brides here so I just want to share tips that I learned while planning my wedding, on the day of the wedding and of course after the wedding.

1. Before attending a bridal fair try to source out suppliers muna on social media based on your pegs, budget, reviews, and kung accesible ba yung supplier based on your wedding location. 
By doing this kasi nanarrow down na yung choices ko and my idea na ko sa rates nila, sa output nila bago ko pa sila mameet sa bridal fair. When attending the fair kasi maooverwhelm ka sa dami ng suppliers na makakausap mo or magbibigay sayo ngflyers and magpipitch and if you’re a mahiyain people pleaser person mapapa Oo ka sa kung sino makausap mo don without knowing kung match ba peg mo sa service nila or kung maganda ba talaga reviews nila. This is specially helpful for P&V suppliers and stylists. Try to join Wawies group on fb kasi makikita nyo honest reviews ng graduate brides sa suppliers nila. Thats what I did, or pag may nakita akong supplier sa fair na parang gusto ko sinesearch ko muna sila sa WAWIES bago ako mag Dp:)

2. Eto naman is natutunan ko lang after the wedding. TRY TO CONSIDER YOUR P&V BASED ON HOW QUICKLY THEY CAN PROVIDE THE OUTPUT. Kasi ako although pasok sa peg ko yung nakuha naming team and maayos sila kausap di ko naconsider na matagal pala sila magbigay ng final output ng photos. Lol its been 6mos since our wedding and wala pa din photos namin. Tapos na wedding hype namin pero wala pa din ako naaupload. Also, if you want na makuha photos mo a week after your wedding they will charge extra pala (in my case 10k) to get the first 200 of your edited photos. Lol

3. Get a Coordinator that will match or CAN accommodate your peg program. Halos lahat ng coordinator may template na yan na wedding and kaya smooth ang weddings nila kasi pareparehas ang routine, pattern, programs nila for ALL of their weddings. Which is not bad naman (for me at least) kasi sa case na to talagang nagagawa nila smoothly yung weddings. In my case may mga pinabago lang ako sa program namin like may first look ako with my groom and doon kami nag vows sa first look (they executed this smooothly btw) and sa reception program naman sinabi ko lang na ayaw ko ng bouquet toss may iba dapat kami gagawin for that pero di na nasunod kasi limited time. For the girlies na totally iba yung gustong maging flow ng wedding nila from preps, to church to reception make sure that your coordinator will match the energy or peg that you are visualizing kasi if ipilit mo sa traditional coor yung vision mo most likely di masusunod or makakalimutan. If this is the case naman, communicate with your coordinator not once pero paulit ulitin mo and kung pwede ikaw na gumawa ng wedding timeline, details etc para ipakita mo na lang sa kanya. GANYAN GINAWA KO. Hahaha

4. Sobrang cliche nito but this is true. On your wedding day just enjoy the day and let go of small details you cannot control:) Try not to stress kung may small details na di masunod kasi di mo rin mapapansin naman. If may decisions or details na di masunod otd try to assign it to someone you trust and knows you enough to make decisions for you based on how you would handle it. In my case samin lahat ng mga inconvenient situations nung wedding namin hindi sakin pinadaan ng coor kundi sa husband ko. Sya na tinanong ng coor and pinagdecide, kung di naman sure si husband kung pano idedecide specially kung about sa bridal entourage, flowers etc nagconsult sya sa bff ko na MOH ko kung pano gagawin. Ayon, wala talaga ako nalaman na problem until after the wedding. Kaya yung peg ko sobrang gaan and happy lang hahaha. 
Wala naman nangyareng aberya sa wedding namjn smooth and perfect lahat (thank god!) and ang nilapit lang ng coor ko sa husband ko is kung magdagdag pa ng coffee sa coffee bar kasi ubos na yung cups na inavail namin and nung nawala yung envelope na pang bayad sa reception namin (nakita din naman haha).

Madami pa actually di ko lang maalala lahat ngayon.
Anyway if you have questions, comment lang kayo I’ll try my best to answer or if you wanna consult sa call or via zoom we can schedule that (if I have time). Specially sa mga Antipolo/Emerald events brides dyan. 

Yun lang. Happy preps brides:)

# Chapter 1 - Field Visit

Isabel pulled over and parked in front of a cramped matchbox of a house—one of thousands like it, sun-faded and dust-caked in the dry sprawl of Rancho Coronado. It was her last stop of the day, and she tried not to think about the hour-long crawl of rush hour traffic waiting for her after this appointment.

At least the company car had good air conditioning.

She flipped the visor down and checked her reflection in the mirror. Tired, but presentable enough. Her white blouse was still mostly crisp, and the slicked-back bun had held. Not bad for being out on the road all day.

Mrs. Santos wouldn’t care either way, but Isa still pressed her lips together, smoothed her collar. Habit.

She stepped out into the heat. The air was bone-dry and carried that ever-present grit from the desert—coating every house, every mailbox, every sun-warped lawn chair on every porch.

Out here, it barely felt like Night City at all.

She walked up to the door and knocked. A pause, then the door creaked open.

Mrs. Santos peered out, squinting against the blinding white light of day. “Ahh… *mija,* you made it.” Her voice was warm and raspy, and her face lit up in a smile that crinkled her eyes. “I was starting to worry.”

Isa smiled. “Just running behind. Sorry about that, Mrs. Santos.”

The old woman waved a hand. “*Bah.* Don’t be sorry. Come in, come in—it’s too hot to be standing out there like a cactus.”

Inside, the air was only a few degrees cooler. Family photos cluttered the walls. A shrine to generations—faded quinceañera ribbons and faded baptism photos.

“You want water, *mija?* Something cold?”

“I’m okay, thanks.”

Isa set her datapad down on the coffee table and gave the old woman a once-over, gently but professionally.The implant node was still visible behind her ear, a faint red glow beneath the skin. Isa thought with some relief that Mrs. Santos seemed steady today. She’d heard of trial patients who didn’t react so well to the MNEM-04 implant.

Isa sank into an overstuffed chair in the cramped living room. Plastic covered the armrests. She felt more at home here than in the sterile office towers of City Center. Here, it was kitchen warmth, lived-in clutter, dust that never left. It grounded her.

She pulled the datapad back into her lap and opened the MedSync app—Biotechnica’s clinical trial interface. With a blink, she synced the patient file to her Kiroshi optics. A faint blue glint caught in her eye as the overlay displayed across her retinas.

“Start Interview” flashed. “Recording — 30 September 2077, 14:32:21” blinked in the corner of her vision, the timestamp ticking forward.

“You ready for the usual questions, Mrs. Santos? I’m recording now.”

“Of course, sweetie. Go ahead and ask.”

Isa smiled. “Okay. First one: How have you been feeling? Any change since last time?”

“No more headaches.” The old woman tapped her temple. “I still have my arthritis though. Can you make that go away?”

Isa chuckled. “Unfortunately, no. This implant’s just for cognitive enhancement.”

Mrs. Santos gave a warm, crinkled smile. “Well, my memory’s been good! I’m not getting dates mixed up anymore. We had my grandson’s birthday party the other day, down the street. *Ay,* he’s getting so big. *Qué bonito.* And I didn’t forget anyone’s name—not a single one. The whole family was there.”

“That’s wonderful.” Isa’s smile widened. She wished she weren’t recording so she could reach over and give the old woman a hug. Instead, she tapped two checkboxes on the datapad: *relational memory,* *temporal recall—positive response.*

As Isa marked the response, she glanced at the old woman across from her. A few months ago, Mrs. Santos had struggled to remember what day it was, sometimes even Isa’s name. Now, the difference was like night and day.

MNEM-04 was designed to improve memory capacity. It linked directly to the prefrontal cortex, acting like a real-time mental cache. Anything the brain missed or forgot, MNEM-04 remembered. A breakthrough like that should have inspired awe. Once, it did. But Isa had spent years watching boardroom demos of things the public never touched: carbon-fiber bones that never fractured, ocular implants that could swap between infrared and telescopic vision with a blink, cybernetic arms that let some executive bench-press a car for sport. All of it miraculous—and all of it reserved for the ones already on top.

She didn’t marvel anymore. She just noted the trial results, filed the report, and knew where this would land. The execs would be first in line. Analysts, traders, lawyers—the ones paid to hoard information and turn it into more wealth. For them, MNEM-04 wasn’t dignity, it was arbitrage. For everyone else, it might mean remembering a grandkid’s name—if they could bleed their savings for it.

Isa was glad Mrs. Santos had qualified, at least. She’d get to keep the implant if nothing went sideways, and the payout covered a couple months’ rent. That was why people signed up—not for science, not for progress. Just survival.

She moved to the next prompt. “And how has your mood been? Any changes in your emotional state?”

Mrs. Santos made a soft *tsk.* “Same old, same old, sweetie. I’m fine. Just…” She trailed off, wringing her hands. “Worried about my son. He gets into trouble sometimes.”

Mrs. Santos’ face clouded over. “He says he’s working. Says everything’s fine. But a mother knows when her boy’s lying.”

Isa glanced up from the datapad, lips pressed into a neutral line. They were still recording.

She softened her voice. “It’s okay to feel worried. I’m noting that down under stress factors, but I’ll mark it as unrelated to the implant.”

Mrs. Santos nodded gratefully, folding her hands over one another. Isa recognized the gesture. Her own father used to do the same thing—trying to appear calm when the world was anything but.

She logged a few final entries and blink-clicked the stop button in her overlay. *Recording ended. Data syncing to secure trial server…*

Isa set the datapad down and leaned in, voice low. “Is he getting mixed up with 6th Street again?”

Mrs. Santos didn’t answer right away. Her expression pinched with guilt.

“He’s got a little one now. But he’s still doing jobs for them. Running shipments, mostly. Said no guns this time, but—” She exhaled sharply through her nose. “I think he botched one. He’s been looking over his shoulder too much. You know that look.”

Isa did. She’d seen it on too many faces growing up.

“Maybe I can help,” Isa said. “There’s a guy—friend of my dad’s. Runs a car shop near North Oak. Legit, far as I can tell. Might be able to put in a word for him.”

Mrs. Santos blinked, surprised. “You’d do that?”

“Of course.” Isa smiled. “Hard to get out of that life without someone pulling you up.”

She knew that better than most.

The old woman’s eyes softened. “You’ve got a kind heart, mija. Don’t let this city take it from you.”

Isa’s chest tightened, but she pushed a small smile through. “I’ll try.”

She gathered her things, gave a polite squeeze of Mrs. Santos’s shoulder, and headed for the door, letting the heat swallow her back into the sprawl.

The company car was parked two blocks down. A sleek, tinted Quadra with biometric locks.

Isa slid into the driver’s seat and exhaled as the cool air washed over her. She popped the personal link cable from her wrist—baseline tech, nothing fancy. In Night City, you needed at least that much to function. She slotted it into the console jack with a practiced flick.

The dashboard lit up as the car synced to her neural ID and took over the drive.

Outside, the city passed in layers.

Rancho Coronado’s cracked concrete and graffiti-tagged warehouses gave way to the neon grime of downtown’s lower stacks—arcades, massage parlors, food stalls under flickering signs. Then, slowly, the skyline sharpened. The glass got clearer. The ads got subtler. The air even smelled different–like money.

She passed a row of autonomous police cruisers parked like teeth in a grin.

*Corpo Plaza ahead,* the navigation AI purred.

Isa straightened in her seat. She reached for her compact, dabbed at the corners of her eyes. Not much she could do without a full touch-up kit, but the effort helped.

The car slid into Biotechnica’s underground lot with frictionless grace. She stepped out and walked up through the plaza, her heels clicking on imported stone, dwarfed by silver-plated skyscrapers that rose almost infinitely into the sky.

As always, the knot returned—tight in her chest, right behind her ribs.

Game face. She rolled her shoulders once.

She stepped into the elevator. A chirp, a scan, a silent ascent.

# Chapter 2 - 65th Floor

65th floor. Neuralware R&D Division.

Isa had heard about this floor during onboarding—the quiet, well-funded lab that was supposed to chip away at Arasaka's near-total monopoly on neuralware. Everyone in the company knew the story: Arasaka had resources Biotechnica couldn't match. Capital, patents, merc armies. They ruled high-end implants and military-grade cybernetics without serious competition.

But MNEM-04 was supposed to be different. Biotech that blended neural engineering with living tissue instead of rigid chrome. Biotechnica's spearpoint. If it proved viable, it wouldn't just restore memories—it would carve them a seat at a table Arasaka had ruled for decades.

Out in the field, running patient visits and compliance checks, that had all felt distant. Abstract.

Now, stepping onto the floor, she could feel it. The elevator doors opened onto sleek glass and polished steel. Researchers moved between terminals with quiet intensity. The budget was visible in every surface, every piece of equipment.

Biotechnica didn't dare challenge Arasaka outright. But here, in R&D, they were quietly trying to shift the balance—developing proprietary systems, filing strategic patents, stealing slivers of market share. Not enough to provoke. Just enough to matter.

The elevator doors opened onto cool air and gleaming white floors. A few department heads already clustered near the glass conference room. Isa wished she'd fixed her makeup in the car.

The R&D floor was all glass walls and muted ambition—a place where one misstep could end your career. She walked past a vertical garden pulsing with UV grow-lights, engineered eucalyptus barely masking the sterile tang of ozone. Biotechnica's aesthetic: organic innovation wrapped in chrome. Once it had thrilled her. Now it just looked like branding—a green façade for a machine that devoured people as readily as data.

Her heels clicked past familiar faces. Half-smiles, nods. No one stopped to chat.

At Lab 7, she tapped her wrist implant to the scanner. It chirped green. The door slid open.

Jade was already hunched over a console, platinum hair catching the overhead light. ""Hey, superstar,"" she said without looking up. ""Saw your name on the metrics dashboard. Another gold star from the brass?""

Isa gave a modest shrug as she slipped off her blazer and hung it by the wall. “Mrs. Santos had a good week.”

“Wish my trial subjects were as stable as yours,” Priya said from her station near the back, still focused on her slate. “Mine spent twenty minutes explaining how his neighbor stole his front steps.”

The lab door slid open again. Erik Lindholm, their manager, stepped in—tall, neat, every hair in place. He looked like he’d been printed directly from a Biotechnica HR file—except for the stress crease carved between his brows.

“Isa. Jade. Priya. My office. Now.”

The three women exchanged glances. No one asked why.

Erik’s office was a pristine white cube, sparsely furnished, its only adornment a vertical display cycling through live implant telemetry. He waited until the door clicked shut behind them, then gestured toward the chairs.

“As of today, your security clearance has been elevated,” he said. “Needless to say—your NDA is more important than ever.”

Priya raised an eyebrow. “What’s going on?”

He turned to his console and tapped a few commands. “First, I’ll need each of you to connect your personal link here. It’s standard—pushes the new clearance profile directly to your neural ID.”

Jade went first, jacking in without hesitation. Priya followed, silent and efficient.

Isa lingered. The port at her wrist felt heavier than usual. Once she connected, the system would sweep her entire profile. Would some curious InfoSec employee decide to run a deeper background check on her? There was no way to know.

She forced her hand steady, slotted the cable. A pause—then a green blink, a neutral beep.

Jade raised an eyebrow. “Now can you tell us what’s going on?”

“Our unit’s been folded into a larger task group effective immediately,” Erik said. “We’re now working alongside Neuroengineering, QA, Data Science, and Legal. You’ll keep running your fieldwork, but starting today, you’ll be working cross-functionally with teams on the 66th floor.”

Jade leaned forward. “Is this about MNEM-04 going live?”

Erik didn’t nod, but didn’t correct her either. “It’s about the project entering its next phase. That means tighter protocols, increased oversight, and no mistakes. Most trials don’t get this far. Let’s not be the reason this one doesn’t.”

Isa’s stomach fluttered. A background check would tear her fake credentials to shreds.

“You’ll get a full briefing shortly. For now—” He checked the time with a flick of his eyes. “We’re late. Let’s go.”

They followed him out. The elevator whisked them up.

The conference room on 66 wasn’t like the usual glass-walled meeting pods. This one had no windows—just matte black walls, recessed lighting, and a long smart table projecting shimmering neural cluster maps into the air above it.

There were at least two dozen people already seated around the long, oval table when they entered. Isa recognized a few people she had met in passing - Raj from Engineering. Marius from Legal.

Erik’s boss’s boss was sitting at the head of the table. A woman in her late fifties with platinum implants bracketing her temples like a crown. Senior VP Helena Marek.

“Good. You’re all here,” Marek said, without looking up. Isa, Jade and Priya quietly filed in and took their seats at the back of the room as Erik took his seat close to Marek. 

“Thank you all for being here,” Marek said, finally looking up from her slate. “As you’ve likely heard, the MNEM-04 clinical trials are progressing exceptionally well. That’s why you’re all gathered here—because we’re preparing to transition into the next phase.”

She flicked her fingers across the interface, and a series of charts hovered above the smart-table. Compliance rates, neurostability metrics, retention curves.

“Pending final data validation and QA sign-off, we’ll be wrapping trials within the next two weeks. From there, we enter regulatory filings, pre-manufacturing prep, and our go-to-market launch cycle.”

She paused, scanning the room. “Let's be clear about what this really means. Arasaka owns the neuralware market—has for decades. We can't challenge them directly. We don't have the capital or the muscle. But we don't need to beat them head-on.”

She leaned forward slightly.

“MNEM-04 is how we shift the balance. Quietly. Strategically. We file patents they can't touch. We take slivers of market share where they're not looking. Not enough to provoke a war. Just enough to matter. If this launch succeeds, we're not just selling implants—we're carving ourselves a seat at a table Arasaka thought they owned.”

A new slide appeared: a sleek Biotechnica ad mockup showing an elderly man smiling beside the tagline *Remember More. Live Fully.*

“Our public-facing campaign will focus on healthcare applications—dementia care, PTSD treatment, memory stabilization for degenerative conditions. These are real use cases, and we will support them.”

She tapped again. The slide shifted to a forecast chart.

“But our true market drivers lie elsewhere. In Q1 alone, we project contracts with major Tier-1 corporations—finance, infrastructure, aerospace—looking to enhance executive performance. The implant offers measurable improvements in short-term and long-term memory stability, detail retention, and recall speed. Imagine your C-suite with flawless memory and built-in pattern recall.”

A pause. Then the next slide: a world map overlaid with network graphs.

“Long-term, this is more than a medical device. This product is our wedge. It is how we take market share—and not just at the top.”

She stopped, scanning faces instead of slides.

“Our real customers are corporations. Executives. Defense contractors. Governments,” Marek said. “Because MNEM-04 does something no one’s done before.”

A new slide shimmered into view—timeline overlays of memory recall versus breach events.

“It doesn’t just enhance memory. It makes memory traceable. When someone acquires strategic intel, we can timestamp it. When they leak it—we know what they knew, and when they knew it.”

She tapped again. Insider threat models. Litigation forecasts. A cluster graph showing access to confidential data versus intellectual property theft.

“Corporate espionage. Blackmail. Whistleblowers. High-value deal sabotage. These aren’t edge cases—they’re daily threats. And until now, there’s been no reliable way to track the human layer. MNEM-04 changes that.”

A final slide appeared: projected reductions in breach-related losses.

“This isn’t surveillance,” she said. “It’s strategic memory management. And every major player in this city will pay for it.”

The room was quiet for a long minute. Someone coughed. Finally, Marek snapped the display off. 

“But none of it happens without a flawless finish to these trials. The filings must be airtight. The data clean. No anomalies, no noise. Your job—each of you—is to ensure that this phase proceeds without error. Because if it doesn’t, there’s no regulatory approval, no manufacturing ramp-up, no glossy marketing campaign. No product on shelves. It all dies here, if we don’t get it right.”

She gave a tight smile.

“Our internal target for launch is November 1st. That gives us less than a month. I trust you’ll all treat that timeline with the seriousness it deserves.”

Then, cold and direct:

“This isn’t just an implant. It’s an inflection point.”

She turned off the display. “Questions?”

I am a senior in high school and I have been having some bad conflicts with my mom and her boyfriend, this has been a thing since they’ve been together (they’ve been dating since I was in middle school). For context my parents divorced when I was 4, I see my dad often, as my art high school is by his house, and he is very much in the picture of my life even if he isn’t the best dad. 

Recently, I noticed my belongings (specifically food items) going missing. The main one was when I had a snack I really enjoy and I would eat half of it, put it on the counter for later (since my mom kept knocking the bag over in the pantry and they kept spilling so she told me to leave them on the counter). I noticed one time that the bag went missing, I knew I wasn’t done with it but I brushed it off thinking maybe I did finish it all. It happened a lot more and progressively it made me spiral, I struggle with mental health issues sometimes and I truly thought I was going crazy and being unable to remember what happened to my items has been a big stressor in my life. I only found out it was him doing it because I overheard an argument they started having, it made me feel upset but I was glad that it wasn’t me doing it without my own knowledge. Now I know this isn’t a big deal but this has brought immense inconvenience to my life, I’m already stressed with my senior year classes, my clubs, and trying to find a job. I have to go to school and talk with my friends and pretend like things are okay at home when they are not, I constantly have thoughts about not being here so I wouldn’t have to deal with this. My mother usually sides with his behavior towards me and my younger siblings, and the only person in my family I feel like truly loves me is my grandpa. He bought me my first car, gets coffee with me, and we frequently take trips to Costco to get gas for the car and get a food court ice cream. He’s the only person I have on my side right now, I get good grades and do as I am told but I am not the best kid sometimes and after a long day of school I can forget to do my chores or something small of that accord. I feel bad about it a lot but at the same time i definitely feel like I am punished more harshly for my mishaps then my siblings, idk if it is because I am the oldest or what. 

I’m stuck and I feel bad, I am unsure what to do. Any advice is greatly appreciated. ",2,1762494609.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

i’ve made so much progress and i’m so proud of myself for always choosing to push forward another day. only three years ago, i was anorexic, agoraphobic, severely depressed and anxious, unable to sleep/function/live properly… i had no friends (i mean literally zero), i was living at home, and in the worst mental state possible. i had just experienced a severe traumatic event, was abusing medications and engaging in every harmful coping mechanism you can think of. i was scared, sad, exhausted, and hungry from the moment i woke up until i went to sleep at night.

fast forward to today… i’m twenty, living independently in a place of my own that i share with my closest friends. we go out on weekends and chat about our night in the morning over coffee. i cook balanced meals and eat without guilt. i’m slowly weaning myself off smoking, i’m no longer in a stressful relationship, i have an internship and am on the path to get my degree early and on top of that… i can leave my house!! i can sleep at night!! i smile and laugh and play and joke around!! i feel the sun’s warmth on my face!!

sometimes life gets hard. i struggle a lot with mental illness, and it can feel incredibly defeating. but i look back and realize that so much can change in a few years. i’m so grateful to be alive. i’m so glad i never gave up. :)",4,1762494530.0,gratitude,1,1.0,False

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Tell a Referee Whistle from a Squeaky Toy*

---

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Misery and Mild Success**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like a defender crumbles under a 50-yard cross. The odds paint Werder Bremen as a **1:1.91 favorite** (implied probability: \~52%) over Wolfsburg’s **1:3.1 underdog** (\~32%). The draw? A meager **1:3.7** (\~27%), which feels about right for a matchup where neither team can be trusted to finish a sentence, let alone a game plan.

The spread lines are a bureaucratic nightmare: Wolfsburg gets **+0.25 to +0.5 goals**, depending on which bookmaker you ask. It’s like they’re saying, “We’re not sure who to root for, but *somebody* has to cover.” The total goals under 3.0 is a **1.91 favorite**, suggesting this could be the Bundesliga’s most polite clash since Germany invented the term “*Gemütlichkeit*.”

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Empathy, and Existential Coaching Crises**  
Werder Bremen’s Horst Steffen is a man of many words, none more haunting than, “I feel for coaches getting fired, but results are decided by others after the game.” Translation: *I’m terrified of becoming the next casualty.* His team, though, has been a recent streak of “unbeaten” (four games) and “mildly competent.” But key defender **Niklas Stark** is out with a hip injury—imagine your favorite coffee mug suddenly losing its handle. Also, **Victor Boniface** is a question mark after a “poor performance” in Mainz. Is he the starter? Is he a backup? Is he a metaphor for indecision? We may never know.

I feel like as I’ve gotten older, I just cannot handle going on IG and hearing sound anymore. Bring back static photos only. NO SOUND. I don’t want to hear music. I don’t want to hear someone’s 6 minute story about a date with a finance bro who ghosted them or the “emotional journey” behind a pumpkin apple coffee streusel muffin recipe. Just post the photo and the recipe without ""comment APPLE"" so I can send you the recipe. PLEASE! I BEG. I genuinely miss when we didn’t know everything about everyone all the time, when you had to pick up a magazine to see a new face or find out what someone was wearing. I actually don't mind the latter on IG, I love fashion. But as long as it's not someone in their underwear doing a GRWM. I hate that shit. Post the fit and go.

Because I look at this side of influencer culture, like people oversharing about throwing up on their birthday dress, or shitting their pants, or even something as tame as going on hella dates in New York and I just miss when people had boundaries and allure.

1oqm9jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1oqm9jy/who_needs_a_house_ch1/,Who Needs a House Ch.1,"My name is Prinstin, a spit in the eye by my father and his father before him. An extremely demanding chain binding me to the same trade of labor. That's right, trauma. Of course the only way to break this chain is through a very sacred ritual called, being a loser. 

I know that doesn't mean I need to be homeless, but if making money needed an end this would be it. Plus how else am I supposed to know what I need. I’ve been pretty passively self destructive in the past year, attempt after attempt at losing security, security for dick. I’ve been morbidly obese, I’ve turned that into pain and muscle for what, the judgments of people whom I could command just like my fat. The whole world, given to me so I can watch it be given to the next snot filled white sheet waiting to wear the projections of idiots we have the privilege to join. As the youngest blessed with the responsibility of pulp, in order to gain a soul I’d need to define the one I had, leaving home, leaving everything, that’ll do it. That’s not me talking, that’s the Buddha. 

Of course I’m not ignorant, I understand that there are rules, if not of the palace then ones of nature. I left home with a bell tent, a camping stove with a solar generator, all packed and portable on an old red wagon. In my backpack I had three changes of clothes I shouldn't need to clean for a bit, a sleeping bag and a lot of protein. I wasn’t coming back till I’d find a place to call mine, and that wouldn’t be long. Driving out the city to find some abandoned property or a natural bowl I could settle in, I fell into some fortunate graces, I found an apartment. 

Unforeseen road work forced me down unfamiliar trails, trying to find my way back, it was like a whole new pocket I never knew existed. Going down hill I’m quickly hidden by trees and wild foliage that had originally obstructed the exit going under the bridge. Swooping back around I’m immediately the subject of the most beautiful painting, beams of light shaped by tall pines and cottons. The moist air acts as colored gels, creating separations of cool tones. Tightly woven grass, an untouched golf course suited better for carpeting, housing wildlife brave enough to approach this garden's prised fruit. In the middle of the clearing, drenched in blue light at noon, stood a musk red subsidised apartment building. Exposed brick with paint that has warped the wall into some artistic imitation of cracking sand flats.

 A soft red invasive glow keeps me hesitant. I parked on the green, behind a tree where there was more than enough cover to keep the car from being discovered for days, assuming typical foot traffic. Stop the car, I sit in the stale recycled air and debate lighting up, I step out into the quiet field. Shrouded in darkness I can’t help but to feel consciously rejected by it, every living thing has eyes, even blind things, why would the dark be any better. I light a joint as paranoia creeps up on me till I force myself into the protective glow of the warm apartment light, finding my way around to the front, I’m greeted by a scorching cold iron fence. After some more investigation I discover no viable entrance, just a hole that seemed designed to rip whatever was dumb enough to use it. About three feet in diameter and two deep, hooks facing in and staggered, instead I toss my sleeping bag over. Prepared to mend any tearing I scale the fence, avoiding unevenly spaced spikes at the top before landing in the courtyard. 

The iron fence turned an almost rust color before disappearing behind walls of rose bush, its design reaching towards the sky thanks to countless red flakes, I relight. Lettering the checkered patterned grass sat different perfectly trimmed sculptures depicting the middle of some kinda chess game. Heavily favoring one side, the one sign of their stage being a bleeding marble trail following the path of every sculpture. The majority of which are tall and budding with white sage, the other team being reduced to dried shrubs, sustaining itself off its own muck. Following a carefully maintained path I step up onto the first exposed landing, looking over the garden I finish my smoke then drop it onto crumbling concrete.

Stepping inside I feel the world stop and start again as I take in the stark change in environment. It’s extremely white, looks like everything was painted then painted again. On the outside there was exposed brick with what was probably lead paint flaking off, in complete contrast the inside was eggshell white, from tile to foam ceiling panel, layers of uninterrupted eggshell paint. Squeaky soft grips accompany my walk along with drips of dew that must have accumulated on me outside, seamlessly mixing paint and mud. The entry way is a tight but tall corridor with a counter to my right built into the wall and out of service. Continuing down it opens to a lobby with bronze mail boxes, all the furniture having an annoying amount of height, like it was meant to be barside.  

Thud ! . . . .

My attention was ripped away by a thud coming from the staircase. A loud and lone- 

Thud ! . . . .

Thud! . .

Thud!!

From just around the corner comes a beefy green head of lettuce. Flopping diagonally down the stairs and slapping the wall, before rolling and ending at my feet. Beautiful shades of purple that fade into green, a lady comes down the stairs in this silk green gown that changes with the light. Sitting on top, a reddish orange bob with jack-o-lantern teeth, delicate and bright eyes protected by frames that matched her hair. 

“I’m so sorry, I tried to stop it.” She called out on her way after. 

“Oh, that's fine. I was just kinda-” 

Does she want to know what I’m doing in her building? Does she need to know?

Standing at the base of the staircase she softly says. “Hello?”

“Uh sorry, I was looking for a place. I wanted to rent a place to stay.” 

“That’s great, I’m married to the landlord.” She starts over with a pip in her step. “He just went out to get some supplies for the tenets.” Bent down to get her lettuce and snaps up. “ You… could imagine how that is.”

She speaks in place of my silence. “Would you like to come up and wait for him?”

“Oh, ma’am I don’t-”

“Pfft it’s fine, we take meetings in our living room all the time.” She turns and without another invitation, or a single sign of… anything. Still I’ve never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth, if nothing then I might get a meal out of this experience. So I followed the women with the beefy greens. 

The staircase that had been parsley hidden by the doorway, and a lack of lighting I hadn't put much thought towards. First thing of note about the stairwell was the complete lack of corners, from curved step to the next curved steps. It would swoop down to connect with the lower step instead of ending like what's typical for stairs, it wasn’t just the stairs though. The whole cavern had the same painting mishap as the lobby, but it seemed to collect in the corners creating that swoop kinda shape. If that wasn’t enough the staircase was also free standing, if not it’s supported by some optical illusion, maybe that’s why the lights had been so low? Rolling the question around in my head I follow the landlady up to the tenth and top floor, where the walls once again return to brick. 

We walk out of the open stairwell and quickly find ourselves at her door. Opening up, I step into a thick cloud of earthy dough and steaming cloves. I’m met with a moss green shag carpet and the loudest little shit of a dog. 

“Would you mind taking your shoes off, we have little booties if you’d like some”

“No, I’m alright.” I take my shoes off and place them beside the door with my backpack. 

From the kitchen five feet away, she’s already flipping around greens in a pan before checking a pot of an unseen but fragrant green chili. “I’m sorry, could you take a seat over there. I’ll be done in a minute.”

I step over and past her island towards their living space, I sit in one of three different sofas all facing each other. A coffee table with a small radio sits in the middle of seven glasses with varying levels of green. As I sink into a particularly itchy, probably felt lazy boy, a shitsu with its hair up comes hovering over on its well groomed coat. It sat at the end by the lazy boy, looking at me. I take a deep breath and scan the room breaking eye contact with the little guy, Christmas gnomes and tiny deer figurines define the silhouette of random side tables, that’s when I noticed the room was lit by candles. Flickering, dancing lights projecting scenes of tiny villages being ravaged by beastly deer, the twilight forest outlined by moon light divided into beams of yellow ending with oak trimmings before meeting a jungle green carpet. The people rejoice as the dog restores balance to their violent ecosystems, and I sit snuggled up, high as balls. 

 I watch as gnomes get together for a hunt. They gather bobby pins and harvest strips of wood from furniture, festivals in preparation or remorse take place as they prepare their battlements. Isolating a deer that they spend days catching up to just to scare off, their weapons looking more and more like props with every performance. I watch their victory as the forest swirls around us, and the landlady steps in with a plate of fried… things. Spendly little stems coming off one big bulb, pressed in olive oil with spots of cumin. Green of course. She places it on top of the radio and pours one green cup into another before grabbing that glass, giving it a little stir to mix the different shades.

She takes a seat and a sip before lowering the glass to her side. “It’s been great, we’ve never been happier. Just last fall we were out on the streets, we’re registered real estate agents. But independent work hasn’t been kind since all the properties have been going to some private business.” She recrosses her legs before another sip, focus waning. “Being out in the wild, relying on your own way of things, that or starting a new way that's responsible for muck. Not by choice, just the natural way of things. Build off of someone's kingdom, knowing it will erode like the largest mountains. Just like every brick, every crop turning to rot.”

She smiles and flicks her eyes from the ground back to me. 
“Crosses to bare.”
“Baring to cross again.”
“And again.” 

“Began in a familiar reign”
“Get lost, attempt to find,”
“what you know you won’t regain”

“Again and again”

“Ris’in from twilight lighted dirt.”
“Just to lay when the light falls.”
“It’ll hurt, before it’s done.”

“Once they're gone, it’s for me to be done.”
“Again and again”

Her eyes glazed over, her focus long passed where my head was. She’d gone blind in the span of a few words, almost impossible to notice the cataracts set in. She says sheepishly “I don’t want to die”.  I regain motion in my legs and the impulse to be still is impossible, I am trembling. My spirit already leaning obtusely towards the door, I focus on creating that path while shifting pressure to the arms of the chair. Lifting myself up her eyeline doesn't waver, rolling on the palms of my hands I carefully remove my hands. A perfect dismount snubbed by an inevitable creek. 

Her eyes pierce mine, a moving spark in her eyes dance, reseeding back out of sight. “He’s here”. I jump back and kick the dog, it yapps, quickly playing me out. I slammed the door before the thing could finish its crescendo. Unsettled I move two floors and a half down before I’m able to catch my breath, taking a seat on the steps I let my heart rest. The woman with a jack-o-lantern smile, wife of the landlord, so inviting god! What was happening, why invite me to just… be crazy? What was up with the… everything, the candles, the food. What was that spendaly thing she cooked, and that dog, it could have been part of the carpet. Fuck, the carpet, my shoes, my bag! Was that the motivation the whole time? With the silk gown, a singular light behind her eyes, goofy ass smile. And the beefy greens… the lettues… How did the lettuce hit the walls on the way down? Better yet, how did it use the stairs to get down? Drip. Drip. Drip, echoing up the ribbed cavern. 

“He’s here.” I step off on the sixth floor right below me.

I feel like as I’ve gotten older, I just cannot handle going on IG and hearing sound anymore. Bring back static photos only. NO SOUND. I don’t want to hear music. I don’t want to hear someone’s 6 minute story about a date with a finance bro who ghosted them or the “emotional journey” behind a pumpkin apple coffee streusel muffin recipe. Just post the photo and the recipe without ""comment APPLE"" so I can send you the recipe. PLEASE! I BEG. I genuinely miss when we didn’t know everything about everyone all the time, when you had to pick up a magazine to see a new face or find out what someone was wearing. I actually don't mind the latter on IG, I love fashion. But as long as it's not someone in their underwear doing a GRWM. I hate that shit. Post the fit and go.  

Because I look at this side of influencer culture, like people oversharing about throwing up on their birthday dress, or shitting their pants, or even something as tame as going on hella dates in New York and I just miss when people had boundaries and allure. 

And yet there are creators like Jam1lla Strand or Sandra Sh3hab who never speak, and they’re still front row at shows, still getting PR, still clearly *doing well*. Just..how? Is it just a matter of posting aesthetic photos with designer clothes and still maintaining mystery? You never hear them speak!",8,1762493921.0,LAinfluencersnark,0,0.83,False

An extremely demanding chain binding me to the same trade of labor. That's right, trauma. Of course the only way to break this chain is through a very sacred ritual called, being a loser. 

I know that doesn't mean I need to be homeless, but if making money needed an end this would be it. Plus how else am I supposed to know what I need. I’ve been pretty passively self destructive in the past year, attempt after attempt at losing security, security for dick. I’ve been morbidly obese, I’ve turned that into pain and muscle for what, the judgments of people whom I could command just like my fat. The whole world, given to me so I can watch it be given to the next snot filled white sheet waiting to wear the projections of idiots we have the privilege to join. As the youngest blessed with the responsibility of pulp, in order to gain a soul I’d need to define the one I had, leaving home, leaving everything, that’ll do it. That’s not me talking, that’s the Buddha. 

Of course I’m not ignorant, I understand that there are rules, if not of the palace then ones of nature. I left home with a bell tent, a camping stove with a solar generator, all packed and portable on an old red wagon. In my backpack I had three changes of clothes I shouldn't need to clean for a bit, a sleeping bag and a lot of protein. I wasn’t coming back till I’d find a place to call mine, and that wouldn’t be long. Driving out the city to find some abandoned property or a natural bowl I could settle in, I fell into some fortunate graces, I found an apartment. 

Unforeseen road work forced me down unfamiliar trails, trying to find my way back, it was like a whole new pocket I never knew existed. Going down hill I’m quickly hidden by trees and wild foliage that had originally obstructed the exit going under the bridge. Swooping back around I’m immediately the subject of the most beautiful painting, beams of light shaped by tall pines and cottons. The moist air acts as colored gels, creating separations of cool tones. Tightly woven grass, an untouched golf course suited better for carpeting, housing wildlife brave enough to approach this garden's prised fruit. In the middle of the clearing, drenched in blue light at noon, stood a musk red subsidised apartment building. Exposed brick with paint that has warped the wall into some artistic imitation of cracking sand flats.

 A soft red invasive glow keeps me hesitant. I parked on the green, behind a tree where there was more than enough cover to keep the car from being discovered for days, assuming typical foot traffic. Stop the car, I sit in the stale recycled air and debate lighting up, I step out into the quiet field. Shrouded in darkness I can’t help but to feel consciously rejected by it, every living thing has eyes, even blind things, why would the dark be any better. I light a joint as paranoia creeps up on me till I force myself into the protective glow of the warm apartment light, finding my way around to the front, I’m greeted by a scorching cold iron fence. After some more investigation I discover no viable entrance, just a hole that seemed designed to rip whatever was dumb enough to use it. About three feet in diameter and two deep, hooks facing in and staggered, instead I toss my sleeping bag over. Prepared to mend any tearing I scale the fence, avoiding unevenly spaced spikes at the top before landing in the courtyard. 

The iron fence turned an almost rust color before disappearing behind walls of rose bush, its design reaching towards the sky thanks to countless red flakes, I relight. Lettering the checkered patterned grass sat different perfectly trimmed sculptures depicting the middle of some kinda chess game. Heavily favoring one side, the one sign of their stage being a bleeding marble trail following the path of every sculpture. The majority of which are tall and budding with white sage, the other team being reduced to dried shrubs, sustaining itself off its own muck. Following a carefully maintained path I step up onto the first exposed landing, looking over the garden I finish my smoke then drop it onto crumbling concrete.

Stepping inside I feel the world stop and start again as I take in the stark change in environment. It’s extremely white, looks like everything was painted then painted again. On the outside there was exposed brick with what was probably lead paint flaking off, in complete contrast the inside was eggshell white, from tile to foam ceiling panel, layers of uninterrupted eggshell paint. Squeaky soft grips accompany my walk along with drips of dew that must have accumulated on me outside, seamlessly mixing paint and mud. The entry way is a tight but tall corridor with a counter to my right built into the wall and out of service. Continuing down it opens to a lobby with bronze mail boxes, all the furniture having an annoying amount of height, like it was meant to be barside.  

Thud ! . . . .

My attention was ripped away by a thud coming from the staircase. A loud and lone- 

Thud ! . . . .

Thud! . .

Thud!!

From just around the corner comes a beefy green head of lettuce. Flopping diagonally down the stairs and slapping the wall, before rolling and ending at my feet. Beautiful shades of purple that fade into green, a lady comes down the stairs in this silk green gown that changes with the light. Sitting on top, a reddish orange bob with jack-o-lantern teeth, delicate and bright eyes protected by frames that matched her hair. 

“I’m so sorry, I tried to stop it.” She called out on her way after. 

“Oh, that's fine. I was just kinda-” 

Does she want to know what I’m doing in her building? Does she need to know?

Standing at the base of the staircase she softly says. “Hello?”

“Uh sorry, I was looking for a place. I wanted to rent a place to stay.” 

“That’s great, I’m married to the landlord.” She starts over with a pip in her step. “He just went out to get some supplies for the tenets.” Bent down to get her lettuce and snaps up. “ You… could imagine how that is.”

She speaks in place of my silence. “Would you like to come up and wait for him?”

“Oh, ma’am I don’t-”

“Pfft it’s fine, we take meetings in our living room all the time.” She turns and without another invitation, or a single sign of… anything. Still I’ve never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth, if nothing then I might get a meal out of this experience. So I followed the women with the beefy greens.

I've barely used reddit so please forgive me if I'm doing it wrong. 

I'm just wondering if anyone would be interested in joining a CT craft club if I set one up? I'm 28 but I'm thinking it can be open to all ages and just be a place where we can add some whimsy and joy to our lives. 

My vision: once a month-ish, we pick a craft (I was thinking making little flower bouquets and cards for the first one). Then I'd get all the materials and we'd meet at a local coffee shop to do our craft and chat and drink some coffee. 

I'm in Middlesex county but I'm open to traveling around the Hartford and New Haven areas, as well, depending on interest.

If anyone is interested I'll go ahead and make an instagram and facebook and get to planning :) ",1,1762493901.0,Connecticut,1,1.0,False

I’m trying to fall back in love with home and see the city with fresh eyes — not the tourist checklist, but the quiet corners people just walk by. Think under-the-radar parks for perfect sunsets, tiny hole-in-the-wall places to eat that only locals know about, weird little traditions or monthly events, old legends or ghost stories, tucked-away bay views, cool murals that are great for pics, or streets that feel like they belong in a movie. Tell me the spots you think people sleep on — whether it’s a bench with the best view, a deli with the best secret sandwich, a late-night bakery, or a tiny community garden. I’m collecting a list and would love specific addresses, when to go, or any silly tips (like where to park or whether to bring cash). Also, if anyone wants to explore with a chill, curious buddy, I’m totally down to meet new people and tag along. I’m easygoing, love coffee and bad jokes, and I’d rather wander with someone who wants to discover hidden things than do anything too planned.

1oqm79n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Write_Right/comments/1oqm79n/who_needs_a_home_ch1/,Who Needs a Home Ch.1,"My name is Prinstin, a spit in the eye by my father and his father before him. An extremely demanding chain binding me to the same trade of labor. That's right, trauma. Of course the only way to break this chain is through a very sacred ritual called, being a loser. 

I know that doesn't mean I need to be homeless, but if making money needed an end this would be it. Plus how else am I supposed to know what I need. I’ve been pretty passively self destructive in the past year, attempt after attempt at losing security, security for dick. I’ve been morbidly obese, I’ve turned that into pain and muscle for what, the judgments of people whom I could command just like my fat. The whole world, given to me so I can watch it be given to the next snot filled white sheet waiting to wear the projections of idiots we have the privilege to join. As the youngest blessed with the responsibility of pulp, in order to gain a soul I’d need to define the one I had, leaving home, leaving everything, that’ll do it. That’s not me talking, that’s the Buddha. 

Of course I’m not ignorant, I understand that there are rules, if not of the palace then ones of nature. I left home with a bell tent, a camping stove with a solar generator, all packed and portable on an old red wagon. In my backpack I had three changes of clothes I shouldn't need to clean for a bit, a sleeping bag and a lot of protein. I wasn’t coming back till I’d find a place to call mine, and that wouldn’t be long. Driving out the city to find some abandoned property or a natural bowl I could settle in, I fell into some fortunate graces, I found an apartment. 

Unforeseen road work forced me down unfamiliar trails, trying to find my way back, it was like a whole new pocket I never knew existed. Going down hill I’m quickly hidden by trees and wild foliage that had originally obstructed the exit going under the bridge. Swooping back around I’m immediately the subject of the most beautiful painting, beams of light shaped by tall pines and cottons. The moist air acts as colored gels, creating separations of cool tones. Tightly woven grass, an untouched golf course suited better for carpeting, housing wildlife brave enough to approach this garden's prised fruit. In the middle of the clearing, drenched in blue light at noon, stood a musk red subsidised apartment building. Exposed brick with paint that has warped the wall into some artistic imitation of cracking sand flats.

 A soft red invasive glow keeps me hesitant. I parked on the green, behind a tree where there was more than enough cover to keep the car from being discovered for days, assuming typical foot traffic. Stop the car, I sit in the stale recycled air and debate lighting up, I step out into the quiet field. Shrouded in darkness I can’t help but to feel consciously rejected by it, every living thing has eyes, even blind things, why would the dark be any better. I light a joint as paranoia creeps up on me till I force myself into the protective glow of the warm apartment light, finding my way around to the front, I’m greeted by a scorching cold iron fence. After some more investigation I discover no viable entrance, just a hole that seemed designed to rip whatever was dumb enough to use it. About three feet in diameter and two deep, hooks facing in and staggered, instead I toss my sleeping bag over. Prepared to mend any tearing I scale the fence, avoiding unevenly spaced spikes at the top before landing in the courtyard. 

The iron fence turned an almost rust color before disappearing behind walls of rose bush, its design reaching towards the sky thanks to countless red flakes, I relight. Lettering the checkered patterned grass sat different perfectly trimmed sculptures depicting the middle of some kinda chess game. Heavily favoring one side, the one sign of their stage being a bleeding marble trail following the path of every sculpture. The majority of which are tall and budding with white sage, the other team being reduced to dried shrubs, sustaining itself off its own muck. Following a carefully maintained path I step up onto the first exposed landing, looking over the garden I finish my smoke then drop it onto crumbling concrete.

Stepping inside I feel the world stop and start again as I take in the stark change in environment. It’s extremely white, looks like everything was painted then painted again. On the outside there was exposed brick with what was probably lead paint flaking off, in complete contrast the inside was eggshell white, from tile to foam ceiling panel, layers of uninterrupted eggshell paint. Squeaky soft grips accompany my walk along with drips of dew that must have accumulated on me outside, seamlessly mixing paint and mud. The entry way is a tight but tall corridor with a counter to my right built into the wall and out of service. Continuing down it opens to a lobby with bronze mail boxes, all the furniture having an annoying amount of height, like it was meant to be barside.  

Thud ! . . . .

My attention was ripped away by a thud coming from the staircase. A loud and lone- 

Thud ! . . . .

Thud! . .

Thud!!

From just around the corner comes a beefy green head of lettuce. Flopping diagonally down the stairs and slapping the wall, before rolling and ending at my feet. Beautiful shades of purple that fade into green, a lady comes down the stairs in this silk green gown that changes with the light. Sitting on top, a reddish orange bob with jack-o-lantern teeth, delicate and bright eyes protected by frames that matched her hair. 

“I’m so sorry, I tried to stop it.” She called out on her way after. 

“Oh, that's fine. I was just kinda-” 

Does she want to know what I’m doing in her building? Does she need to know?

Standing at the base of the staircase she softly says. “Hello?”

“Uh sorry, I was looking for a place. I wanted to rent a place to stay.” 

“That’s great, I’m married to the landlord.” She starts over with a pip in her step. “He just went out to get some supplies for the tenets.” Bent down to get her lettuce and snaps up. “ You… could imagine how that is.”

She speaks in place of my silence. “Would you like to come up and wait for him?”

“Oh, ma’am I don’t-”

“Pfft it’s fine, we take meetings in our living room all the time.” She turns and without another invitation, or a single sign of… anything. Still I’ve never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth, if nothing then I might get a meal out of this experience. So I followed the women with the beefy greens. 

The staircase that had been parsley hidden by the doorway, and a lack of lighting I hadn't put much thought towards. First thing of note about the stairwell was the complete lack of corners, from curved step to the next curved steps. It would swoop down to connect with the lower step instead of ending like what's typical for stairs, it wasn’t just the stairs though. The whole cavern had the same painting mishap as the lobby, but it seemed to collect in the corners creating that swoop kinda shape. If that wasn’t enough the staircase was also free standing, if not it’s supported by some optical illusion, maybe that’s why the lights had been so low? Rolling the question around in my head I follow the landlady up to the tenth and top floor, where the walls once again return to brick. 

We walk out of the open stairwell and quickly find ourselves at her door. Opening up, I step into a thick cloud of earthy dough and steaming cloves. I’m met with a moss green shag carpet and the loudest little shit of a dog. 

“Would you mind taking your shoes off, we have little booties if you’d like some”

“No, I’m alright.” I take my shoes off and place them beside the door with my backpack. 

From the kitchen five feet away, she’s already flipping around greens in a pan before checking a pot of an unseen but fragrant green chili. “I’m sorry, could you take a seat over there. I’ll be done in a minute.”

I step over and past her island towards their living space, I sit in one of three different sofas all facing each other. A coffee table with a small radio sits in the middle of seven glasses with varying levels of green. As I sink into a particularly itchy, probably felt lazy boy, a shitsu with its hair up comes hovering over on its well groomed coat. It sat at the end by the lazy boy, looking at me. I take a deep breath and scan the room breaking eye contact with the little guy, Christmas gnomes and tiny deer figurines define the silhouette of random side tables, that’s when I noticed the room was lit by candles. Flickering, dancing lights projecting scenes of tiny villages being ravaged by beastly deer, the twilight forest outlined by moon light divided into beams of yellow ending with oak trimmings before meeting a jungle green carpet. The people rejoice as the dog restores balance to their violent ecosystems, and I sit snuggled up, high as balls. 

 I watch as gnomes get together for a hunt. They gather bobby pins and harvest strips of wood from furniture, festivals in preparation or remorse take place as they prepare their battlements. Isolating a deer that they spend days catching up to just to scare off, their weapons looking more and more like props with every performance. I watch their victory as the forest swirls around us, and the landlady steps in with a plate of fried… things. Spendly little stems coming off one big bulb, pressed in olive oil with spots of cumin. Green of course. She places it on top of the radio and pours one green cup into another before grabbing that glass, giving it a little stir to mix the different shades.

She takes a seat and a sip before lowering the glass to her side. “It’s been great, we’ve never been happier. Just last fall we were out on the streets, we’re registered real estate agents. But independent work hasn’t been kind since all the properties have been going to some private business.” She recrosses her legs before another sip, focus waning. “Being out in the wild, relying on your own way of things, that or starting a new way that's responsible for muck. Not by choice, just the natural way of things. Build off of someone's kingdom, knowing it will erode like the largest mountains. Just like every brick, every crop turning to rot.”

She smiles and flicks her eyes from the ground back to me. 
“Crosses to bare.”
“Baring to cross again.”
“And again.” 

“Began in a familiar reign”
“Get lost, attempt to find,”
“what you know you won’t regain”

“Again and again”

“Ris’in from twilight lighted dirt.”
“Just to lay when the light falls.”
“It’ll hurt, before it’s done.”

“Once they're gone, it’s for me to be done.”
“Again and again”

Her eyes glazed over, her focus long passed where my head was. She’d gone blind in the span of a few words, almost impossible to notice the cataracts set in. She says sheepishly “I don’t want to die”.  I regain motion in my legs and the impulse to be still is impossible, I am trembling.

Before that, the last time I saw her was years ago. I could never forgive her or my so-called father for how they were. My dad was an aggressive addict. My mum was so weak that she made me and my brother take care of her, while all of us endured his abuse and her refusal to leave him. I had this kind of “love” for her, like trying to protect the most innocent creature from the evil in the world. She was fragile, pure in a way. Mentally, she was a child—unable to process anything without our help. She relied on us so much that I felt proud every time I managed to make her feel better. She still relies on my brother like that. Infantile. Not understanding anything about the world. 

When I grew up, I realized it was emotional torture. I distanced myself, and paid the price in guilt. Fifteen-plus years of counselling and antidepressants. I hadn’t seen her in years until a few days ago. She showed up at my door. Old. Weak. I invited her in for coffee. She said she misses me and can’t live without me in her life. I told her I’m done. That she needs to find a way to process this. That I don’t hold a grudge. And I asked her to leave.

Now those fifteen minutes are eating me alive.

I never wanted her to make me love her in a way that would haunt me forever. I was just a kid. I don’t even know if any of this makes sense.

I saw a Lebanese coffee shop, several Middle Eastern restaurants, and a few kebab places that looked way better than anything we’d seen near the tourist spots.

There were also tons of Indian restaurants everywhere (which makes sense given history), and we even tried Thai food one evening. Honestly, the food from all these immigrant communities had way more flavor than the “traditional” British stuff we’d been eating earlier in the trip.

It’s kind of funny — Britain conquered half the world for spices, but it’s the people who came from those places who brought the real flavor back 😅

It may show how poor English language cuisine is, but the English names where both translations could have evolved from (""Tea Lady"" in the UK or ""Soda Jerk"" in the US) just don't cut it and certainly loses it's exotic appeal that both beverages deserve.

Cheesemaking is a huge industry also, but the English ""Cheesemaker"" just doesn't cut it also.  I await the day ""Fromager"" enters our lexicon *proper*.

Hey everyone,

Been thinking a lot about what it *really* means to ""maximize"" our lives. It's not always about massive, life-altering changes. More often than not, it's the small, consistent tweaks that unlock the next level.

It’s easy to get stuck in a routine that feels more like a rut. We know we have more in us, but figuring out how to tap into it can feel overwhelming.

So, I wanted to share a few simple, powerful ""hacks"" that have genuinely made a difference for me. They're not rocket science, but they work.

*   **The ""Win the Morning"" Rule.** Forget complicated morning routines. Just pick ONE thing you can do within the first 10 minutes of waking up that makes you feel in control. It could be making your bed, drinking a full glass of water, or doing 60 seconds of stretching. Starting with a small, intentional win sets the tone for the entire day.

*   **""Stack"" Your Habits.** Trying to start a new habit from scratch is tough. The cheat code is to ""stack"" it onto an existing one. Want to meditate? Do it for two minutes right after you brush your teeth. Want to read more? Read one page after you pour your morning coffee. The old habit becomes the trigger for the new one. It's shockingly effective.

*   **The Emotional Audit.** We spend so much time optimizing our schedules and to-do lists, but we often ignore our emotional state. Sometimes the biggest block isn't a lack of productivity; it's unprocessed emotional baggage. Taking a moment to understand what's *really* going on inside is a superpower. Getting a clear roadmap for your emotional well-being can be a game-changer, and I found that using **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** helped create a solid plan to tackle that side of things.

*   **The 5-Minute Reset.** Feeling overwhelmed or scattered? Don't just push through it. Stop what you're doing. Set a timer for 5 minutes. You can stand up, walk around, listen to one song, or just stare out the window. It's a circuit breaker for your brain that prevents burnout and helps you come back to a task with fresh eyes.

These aren't about becoming a productivity machine; they're about creating more space, clarity, and intention in your day. It all adds up.

What's one small ""hack"" you all use to make your day just a little bit better? Curious to hear what works for everyone else.",1,1762492869.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1oqlxi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oqlxi5/who_needs_a_house_ch1/,Who Needs a House Ch.1,"My name is Prinstin, a spit in the eye by my father and his father before him. An extremely demanding chain binding me to the same trade of labor. That's right, trauma. Of course the only way to break this chain is through a very sacred ritual called, being a loser. 

I know that doesn't mean I need to be homeless, but if making money needed an end this would be it. Plus how else am I supposed to know what I need. I’ve been pretty passively self destructive in the past year, attempt after attempt at losing security, security for dick. I’ve been morbidly obese, I’ve turned that into pain and muscle for what, the judgments of people whom I could command just like my fat. The whole world, given to me so I can watch it be given to the next snot filled white sheet waiting to wear the projections of idiots we have the privilege to join. As the youngest blessed with the responsibility of pulp, in order to gain a soul I’d need to define the one I had, leaving home, leaving everything, that’ll do it. That’s not me talking, that’s the Buddha. 

Of course I’m not ignorant, I understand that there are rules, if not of the palace then ones of nature. I left home with a bell tent, a camping stove with a solar generator, all packed and portable on an old red wagon. In my backpack I had three changes of clothes I shouldn't need to clean for a bit, a sleeping bag and a lot of protein. I wasn’t coming back till I’d find a place to call mine, and that wouldn’t be long. Driving out the city to find some abandoned property or a natural bowl I could settle in, I fell into some fortunate graces, I found an apartment. 

Unforeseen road work forced me down unfamiliar trails, trying to find my way back, it was like a whole new pocket I never knew existed. Going down hill I’m quickly hidden by trees and wild foliage that had originally obstructed the exit going under the bridge. Swooping back around I’m immediately the subject of the most beautiful painting, beams of light shaped by tall pines and cottons. The moist air acts as colored gels, creating separations of cool tones. Tightly woven grass, an untouched golf course suited better for carpeting, housing wildlife brave enough to approach this garden's prised fruit. In the middle of the clearing, drenched in blue light at noon, stood a musk red subsidised apartment building. Exposed brick with paint that has warped the wall into some artistic imitation of cracking sand flats.

 A soft red invasive glow keeps me hesitant. I parked on the green, behind a tree where there was more than enough cover to keep the car from being discovered for days, assuming typical foot traffic. Stop the car, I sit in the stale recycled air and debate lighting up, I step out into the quiet field. Shrouded in darkness I can’t help but to feel consciously rejected by it, every living thing has eyes, even blind things, why would the dark be any better. I light a joint as paranoia creeps up on me till I force myself into the protective glow of the warm apartment light, finding my way around to the front, I’m greeted by a scorching cold iron fence. After some more investigation I discover no viable entrance, just a hole that seemed designed to rip whatever was dumb enough to use it. About three feet in diameter and two deep, hooks facing in and staggered, instead I toss my sleeping bag over. Prepared to mend any tearing I scale the fence, avoiding unevenly spaced spikes at the top before landing in the courtyard. 

The iron fence turned an almost rust color before disappearing behind walls of rose bush, its design reaching towards the sky thanks to countless red flakes, I relight. Lettering the checkered patterned grass sat different perfectly trimmed sculptures depicting the middle of some kinda chess game. Heavily favoring one side, the one sign of their stage being a bleeding marble trail following the path of every sculpture. The majority of which are tall and budding with white sage, the other team being reduced to dried shrubs, sustaining itself off its own muck. Following a carefully maintained path I step up onto the first exposed landing, looking over the garden I finish my smoke then drop it onto crumbling concrete.

Stepping inside I feel the world stop and start again as I take in the stark change in environment. It’s extremely white, looks like everything was painted then painted again. On the outside there was exposed brick with what was probably lead paint flaking off, in complete contrast the inside was eggshell white, from tile to foam ceiling panel, layers of uninterrupted eggshell paint. Squeaky soft grips accompany my walk along with drips of dew that must have accumulated on me outside, seamlessly mixing paint and mud. The entry way is a tight but tall corridor with a counter to my right built into the wall and out of service. Continuing down it opens to a lobby with bronze mail boxes, all the furniture having an annoying amount of height, like it was meant to be barside.  

Thud ! . . . .

My attention was ripped away by a thud coming from the staircase. A loud and lone- 

Thud ! . . . .

Thud! . .

Thud!!

From just around the corner comes a beefy green head of lettuce. Flopping diagonally down the stairs and slapping the wall, before rolling and ending at my feet. Beautiful shades of purple that fade into green, a lady comes down the stairs in this silk green gown that changes with the light. Sitting on top, a reddish orange bob with jack-o-lantern teeth, delicate and bright eyes protected by frames that matched her hair. 

“I’m so sorry, I tried to stop it.” She called out on her way after. 

“Oh, that's fine. I was just kinda-” 

Does she want to know what I’m doing in her building? Does she need to know?

Standing at the base of the staircase she softly says. “Hello?”

“Uh sorry, I was looking for a place. I wanted to rent a place to stay.” 

“That’s great, I’m married to the landlord.” She starts over with a pip in her step. “He just went out to get some supplies for the tenets.” Bent down to get her lettuce and snaps up. “ You… could imagine how that is.”

She speaks in place of my silence. “Would you like to come up and wait for him?”

“Oh, ma’am I don’t-”

“Pfft it’s fine, we take meetings in our living room all the time.” She turns and without another invitation, or a single sign of… anything. Still I’ve never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth, if nothing then I might get a meal out of this experience. So I followed the women with the beefy greens. 

The staircase that had been parsley hidden by the doorway, and a lack of lighting I hadn't put much thought towards. First thing of note about the stairwell was the complete lack of corners, from curved step to the next curved steps. It would swoop down to connect with the lower step instead of ending like what's typical for stairs, it wasn’t just the stairs though. The whole cavern had the same painting mishap as the lobby, but it seemed to collect in the corners creating that swoop kinda shape. If that wasn’t enough the staircase was also free standing, if not it’s supported by some optical illusion, maybe that’s why the lights had been so low? Rolling the question around in my head I follow the landlady up to the tenth and top floor, where the walls once again return to brick. 

We walk out of the open stairwell and quickly find ourselves at her door. Opening up, I step into a thick cloud of earthy dough and steaming cloves. I’m met with a moss green shag carpet and the loudest little shit of a dog. 

“Would you mind taking your shoes off, we have little booties if you’d like some”

“No, I’m alright.” I take my shoes off and place them beside the door with my backpack. 

From the kitchen five feet away, she’s already flipping around greens in a pan before checking a pot of an unseen but fragrant green chili. “I’m sorry, could you take a seat over there. I’ll be done in a minute.”

I step over and past her island towards their living space, I sit in one of three different sofas all facing each other. A coffee table with a small radio sits in the middle of seven glasses with varying levels of green. As I sink into a particularly itchy, probably felt lazy boy, a shitsu with its hair up comes hovering over on its well groomed coat. It sat at the end by the lazy boy, looking at me. I take a deep breath and scan the room breaking eye contact with the little guy, Christmas gnomes and tiny deer figurines define the silhouette of random side tables, that’s when I noticed the room was lit by candles. Flickering, dancing lights projecting scenes of tiny villages being ravaged by beastly deer, the twilight forest outlined by moon light divided into beams of yellow ending with oak trimmings before meeting a jungle green carpet. The people rejoice as the dog restores balance to their violent ecosystems, and I sit snuggled up, high as balls. 

 I watch as gnomes get together for a hunt. They gather bobby pins and harvest strips of wood from furniture, festivals in preparation or remorse take place as they prepare their battlements. Isolating a deer that they spend days catching up to just to scare off, their weapons looking more and more like props with every performance. I watch their victory as the forest swirls around us, and the landlady steps in with a plate of fried… things. Spendly little stems coming off one big bulb, pressed in olive oil with spots of cumin. Green of course. She places it on top of the radio and pours one green cup into another before grabbing that glass, giving it a little stir to mix the different shades.

She takes a seat and a sip before lowering the glass to her side. “It’s been great, we’ve never been happier. Just last fall we were out on the streets, we’re registered real estate agents. But independent work hasn’t been kind since all the properties have been going to some private business.” She recrosses her legs before another sip, focus waning. “Being out in the wild, relying on your own way of things, that or starting a new way that's responsible for muck. Not by choice, just the natural way of things. Build off of someone's kingdom, knowing it will erode like the largest mountains. Just like every brick, every crop turning to rot.”

She smiles and flicks her eyes from the ground back to me. 
“Crosses to bare.”
“Baring to cross again.”
“And again.” 

“Began in a familiar reign”
“Get lost, attempt to find,”
“what you know you won’t regain”

“Again and again”

“Ris’in from twilight lighted dirt.”
“Just to lay when the light falls.”
“It’ll hurt, before it’s done.”

“Once they're gone, it’s for me to be done.”
“Again and again”

Her eyes glazed over, her focus long passed where my head was. She’d gone blind in the span of a few words, almost impossible to notice the cataracts set in. She says sheepishly “I don’t want to die”.  I regain motion in my legs and the impulse to be still is impossible, I am trembling. My spirit already leaning obtusely towards the door, I focus on creating that path while shifting pressure to the arms of the chair. Lifting myself up her eyeline doesn't waver, rolling on the palms of my hands I carefully remove my hands. A perfect dismount snubbed by an inevitable creek. 

Her eyes pierce mine, a moving spark in her eyes dance, reseeding back out of sight. “He’s here”. I jump back and kick the dog, it yapps, quickly playing me out. I slammed the door before the thing could finish its crescendo. Unsettled I move two floors and a half down before I’m able to catch my breath, taking a seat on the steps I let my heart rest. The woman with a jack-o-lantern smile, wife of the landlord, so inviting god! What was happening, why invite me to just… be crazy? What was up with the… everything, the candles, the food. What was that spendaly thing she cooked, and that dog, it could have been part of the carpet. Fuck, the carpet, my shoes, my bag! Was that the motivation the whole time? With the silk gown, a singular light behind her eyes, goofy ass smile. And the beefy greens… the lettues… How did the lettuce hit the walls on the way down? Better yet, how did it use the stairs to get down? Drip. Drip. Drip, echoing up the ribbed cavern. 

“He’s here.” I step off on the sixth floor right below me.

First day back this girl starts talking to me. She was curious about the college I go to and we connected over both being in school. Over the weeks we continue to talk and eventually I get the balls to get her socials and ask her to hangout outside of work. She says yes and we get coffee, it went great and she said she’d wanna hangout again. 

Once I started texting her outside of work the conversation literally never ended. She would put in just as much effort as I did when texting. We would talk about everything and she quickly became best friends. I knew I was getting feelings, but I was uncertain about her. She told me a-lot about her personal life, openly told me I became one of the few people she texted everyday, told her family about me and we even flirted a bit. She became so comfortable with me she literally told me about her body if you catch my drift, she even said she never told people about that except past partners. Every time i came into work she came up to me before I clocked in and we talked. It was great.

I have self sabotaging tendencies and I couldn’t believe she would like me based on her past boyfriends, I am not her type at all. I started planning my escape, I thought university would separate us but it only brought us closer. Things got a bit flirty and she said she missed me. This really threw me over the edge and I crashed out. A few days later we’re hanging out and I ask her if she ever thought I liked her, she said at one point but not anymore. And for whatever reason I say to her, i thought I did but I never thought about sleeping with you. This upset her understandably and asks for a break. She said I needed to get over her and that is the only way.

About a week later I ask her to block me because I wanted to completely move on. She didn’t want to but did. That’s where everything settled in. She’s gone, I gone fucked up. I tried to move on and it was okay after one week but then my friend ran into her at a party. When drunk my coworker tells my friend she loves me and cares about me so much. Either this meant I was so deep in the friendzone or she actually liked me. I had my friend text her asking her to unblock me, she said she’d think about it. She decided to not and asked for me to continue to respect the space which I’m doing.

I have not been the same person since. I lost a perfectly good friend possible girlfriend due to a fear of rejection. I’ve tried talking to other girls but it just doesn’t feel the same. I’ve restarted therapy and actively want to stop self sabotaging, I still am here or there but damn it’s crazy how much a single person can influence your life. Since going back to school she’ll work one or two days a week and I heard she stopped talking to basically anyone, but she did talk to our mutual friend who’s a coworker. She does still care about me, she told my friend she woudn’t cause any issues at work and I already told her I woudn’t either. It just sucks man, I deserve to lose this great friend but she didn’t deserve to get hurt again. She has already gotten hurt by so many other people, I told myself I woudn’t be one of them but here we are. I’m a fucking loser. 

  
I have to see her in a few weeks. I'm planning on not saying a word to her unless I have to but sometimes i wish I could sit her down and just explain myself because I found out so much within these last two months. ",1,1762492486.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

We had about 10 cups so there was still enough for some customers. I thought they were so cute, but I have a rule that I dont buy merch on launches. This is mainly so my coworkers and customers can get what they want first. Because my OP manager was saying the hello kitty would go by super quick and this was my first launch as manager, I was thinking at least one would be left behind. But when we started setting up holiday yesterday about 15-20 people asled if we were setting out the bear cups. I figured I wasnt getting one and I honestly debated on breaking my rule, but I know I would feel guilty for the people that would come in and ask about it, if I had bought one. ANYWAY! I was scrolling through the reddit and saw someone say that they have similar ones on amazon so I figured I'd look and OMG!! The only thing they are missing is the Starbucks logo. For 1 its 31.88 and for 2 its 58.88 which means they are cheaper anyway. All I had to look up was ""bear glass mug"". Just in case some of yall missed out I wanted you to know the ones on amazon exist!

**verbally abusive boss**

**Trigger Warnings:** >!hostile workplace!<

----

[Original Post](https://www.askamanager.org/2008/09/verbally-abusive-boss.html): **September 11, 2008**

I recently left a large internet company to join a well established, yet small creative agency. The company’s philosophy of listening and constantly learning really connected with me and the team was very passionate about doing good work for a great set of clients.

The issue here is the level of verbal abuse that I have since found out is a feature of the work environment. The cool radio station playing in the background wasn’t because the office was hip – it was to cover up the screaming coming from the executive office for even the smallest offenses. Late 10 minutes? Well, you are going to get yelled at for a half hour and have every other fault or perceived flaw flung at you along with a litany of questioning of your professionalism and dedication. Didn’t convey the exact message that the founder force fed you before a client meeting? Well, that is good for at least an hour.

I have tried everything from being calm and reasonable, to trying to get a work in edge wise, to confronting him and telling him behavior is unprofessional and damaging, to just flat out ending the conversation and walking out. Unfortunately, because I am not willing to sit through these tirades with my hands folded and head down like all of the other executive team, I am being froze out of key meetings and now enduring work which is totally not in my job description suddenly becoming my responsibility (i.e. I am a producer and suddenly I am being told that site QA, customer research and architecture work is also part of my duties).

I am a senior level person with over 10 years of experience and have not had the experience of working for someone who only knows how to express themselves by yelling. I just started this job and really would like to get a year in before going, but this is taking a toll on my health and I dread stepping foot in this place. There were also a whole host of things that they flat out lied about during the interview process (no 401k, no flexible hours, team is widely dispersed) and I would have never taken this role if I had known. I am not sure what to do here – I am very on edge and don’t think I have it in me to deal with another day wasted with these tirades.

[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2009/12/where-are-they-now-update-2-featuring.html): **December 19, 2009 (15 months later)**

I emailed you a little over a year ago (see entry under “jerks” for September 2008) about my verbally abusive boss at a small creative agency. Well – I hung in there until I couldn’t stand it any longer and found something else and gave my notice two days before the Thanksgiving break in 2008. I honestly don’t think I have ever had such a tirade unleashed against me as when I gave my notice. He badgered me over and over about how I had misconstrued his yelling and that he was just passionate about his work. It then turned into a horrible set of personal attacks and threats of lawsuits if I ever contacted anyone from the agency again – he even demanded that I remove the agency’s name from my LinkedIn profile as he perceived it to be some sort of legal infringement for me to even say I had ever worked there.

Long story short – instead of the two weeks I intended to give, I left at the end of the following day. This was not before he got the whole company together (about 20 people) in the conference room to talk about how little I had added to their process and how they would be going on and probably doing better now that I was gone. Two more people gave their notices by the end of that day because he was such a tyrant about the whole thing.

Unfortunately the job I left for was somewhat out of the frying pan and into the fire. I left for a publicly traded, much larger creative agency as a director and was really excited to get to hopefully work with some decent folks again. On day one – I got a taste of how things really were – they “forgot” to mention that I was expected to keep a set of clothes at work for all of the all-nighters and then showed me the sleeping bunks they had built along with a shower so folks could live at work.

I was given accounts in both LA and NY (despite having been told there would be no travel), so I worked from 5am til 8 or 9pm and was routinely called out in executive meetings for not taking one for the team (all the rest of whom where single and without kids unlike me) and staying on with them all night. The final straw was when the company did not protect me from a mid-level manager who obviously had mental issues and that I had a strong hand in her getting fired because of client complaints. She slashed my tires, broke into the office and stole a laptop, and then called my multi-million dollar client and aired all of the company’s dirty laundry. When they left her go, I was told to leave the office and stay at a nearby cafe because they were worried that she would become physically violent – never mind that I had to buy my own coffee. In the end, even though the worst did not take place, I had to endure numerous phone calls from her at all hours and slanderings on facebook.

After 10 months, I have since left that agency as well and have vowed to never work in an agency again. I am currently relocating and am looking for a nice, “normal” quiet job after taking 6 months off to recuperate.

## **Overview**
Every year, people across the world spend nearly one trillion dollars on groceries. It’s an industry that’s been around for centuries. Food itself, however, has been a constant in people’s lives since the beginning of time. Yes, sustenance is essential, but it’s also much more than that. Food can be a part of a daily ritual or a special moment that resonates with people on a meaningful and emotional level. It can be a much-needed break in a long day, a taste that brings back memories, a creative experiment, a shared meal with loved ones, or even comfort during a hard time. Whether it’s a special occasion or an everyday occurrence, it should always be easy for people to get the ingredients they need.
The Instacart Design Team is dedicated to making grocery shopping effortless for everyone and finding solutions to large-scale opportunities that will forever change the way people feed themselves and their loved ones.

You will have the opportunity to shape and drive innovative design solutions across a variety of impactful initiatives.

You'll play a pivotal role in evolving retailer operations tools for catalog management, order management, and fulfillment, empowering retailers to succeed at scale. Additionally, you’ll contribute to crafting seamless and engaging user experiences in our marketplace app, focusing on loyalty programs, deals, coupons, and more that delight millions of users.

I have started to wonder if there's just something about me that's wrong or if I'm just worrying about this topic too much atm. Besides my husband I have 4 other friends. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety ever since I was in my last job so the few friends I made eventually moved out to other cities or countries and tried to make more friends in the area since I still struggle with depression and I desire to be better and a stable environment (that's what my therapist said I should do, have friends Imao).

I'm a full time artist now and I have realized that I want friends to have phone calls with, I want to go out and have coffee, walk around with friends, eat out together, maybe even go hiking! But I have no friends to do this with, all my few friends are either in the states or somewhere actually far away and I feel desperate however I have no clue how to socialize properly and no clue of where to start to get a nice and sincere friendship.

1oqljv4,https://youtu.be/P7DDtIFdKGc,4 Very Scary TRUE Solo Wilderness Horror Stories,"# ""Run. Just Run."":

I woke up in that motel room in Williamstown, Massachusetts, rubbing my eyes as the weak dawn light seeped through the blinds. The clock read just past six. My body ached, but the trail was calling. After cramming gear into my pack and scribbling down the last of last night’s notes, I ate cold leftover noodles straight from the container. Not gourmet, but it would do. I had more than thirty miles to push today—Vermont by nightfall, if luck held.

The mile and a half back to the Appalachian Trail felt endless before coffee, so I stuck out my thumb on the quiet road. Within minutes, a pickup slowed beside me, the driver leaning over to pop the door open.

“Hop in,” he said. “Name’s Andre. Heading to work. You?”

“Back to the AT,” I told him, hefting my pack onto the floorboard. “Trying to make good miles today.”

He smiled, that knowing look locals give to long-distance hikers. “You’ve been at this a while?”

“About three thousand miles so far this year,” I said. His eyebrows rose. We talked about the weather, the views, the rhythm of the trail—just small, human talk that feels grounding after so much solitude. When he dropped me at the trailhead, he gave a little wave. “Stay safe out there.”

The trail met me with a cool breeze and the hush of a river running alongside. Rocks still slick from last night’s rain glistened like wet glass. The so-called rock garden lived up to its name—a jumble of boulders forcing me onto all fours, palms pressed against cold, mossy stone. Each step demanded focus, but once I hit the ridge, the terrain opened up. A single bar of service let me upload a few notes, that tiny digital connection making me feel a little less alone.

A few miles later, I caught up to Sunflower—a day hiker I’d met yesterday. Her car was parked nearby, her pace relaxed.

“How’s the trail treating you?” she asked, falling into step beside me.

“Not bad,” I said. “That rock section was brutal, though. I’m aiming for the Vermont line.”

We talked about our setups—her car camping rhythm versus my constant forward push. “You’re brave doing this solo,” she said.

“It’s freeing,” I admitted, “but it gets lonely sometimes.”

We crossed the state line together, my fourteenth of the year. I took a photo—muddy boots, the green Vermont sign—and felt that flicker of pride. As the grade steepened, I pushed ahead. “See you down the trail!”

More hikers appeared through the day—section trekkers heading south. One, a gray-bearded guy who called himself Gazer, stopped me. “Thru-hiked back in ‘03,” he said. “Think I know your friend TABA. You’re doing great, kid. Keep it up.”

His words stuck with me through the next few miles of mud and stream crossings. My phone buzzed. It was Iceman, a friend from earlier on the trail.

“Hey,” his message read, “no luck finding your pendant yet, but people are still looking—even brought metal detectors.”

The kindness of strangers hits different out here. “Thanks, man,” I replied. “You guys are incredible.”

He texted back: “Road crossing at Route 9—got food for you.”

By the time I reached it, he was there waiting, grinning beside his car.

“Surprise!” he laughed, holding out a plate of hot dogs, salad, and a cold soda.

It felt like a feast. We sat in the grass, swapping trail stories as I inhaled every bite. “You have no idea how much this means,” I said. He waved it off, but the gesture filled my chest with something like warmth after so many miles of solitude.

Around quarter to three, I shouldered my pack again. Ten miles uphill ahead—Vermont’s first big test. The initial miles flew by, adrenaline still buzzing from the food and friendship. I crossed a small bridge near Bennington, feeling strong.

Then I saw the spur trail—a sign for a shelter a short walk off-route. Nature called, so I veered that way.

That’s when I saw him.

A man sat at the picnic table, dressed in bright orange—too clean, too still. When he spotted me, he lifted his arm and waved, motioning sharply. At first I thought it was a hunter signaling.

I took out an earbud. “What?”

“Come here,” he said. His voice was calm. Too calm.

I hesitated. “What do you need?”

“Please,” he said again, tone unwavering. “Come here. Someone’s trying to poison me.”

The words sank like stones. Every instinct in me went rigid. His tone didn’t match the message. No panic, no urgency. Just… control. My gut screamed **no**.

Without another word, I turned and bolted.

“Stop! Come back!” he shouted, voice cutting through the forest.

Branches whipped against my arms as I tore back toward the main trail. I didn’t look back—just a quick glance over my shoulder, nothing behind me. Heart hammering. Backpack thudding. The quiet woods now alive with imagined footsteps.

I ran until my lungs burned, half a mile maybe, before ducking briefly off-trail, crouched behind a log, trying to still my breathing. Every hiker story I’d ever heard flashed through my mind—people vanishing, shelters gone wrong.

My hands shook as I fumbled my phone from my pocket. I didn’t call the police—not first. Out here, that could mean hours. I called Dad.

“Dad, it’s me,” I panted.

“What’s wrong? You sound off.”

“There was a guy—at the shelter. Waved me over, said someone’s poisoning him. He screamed when I ran. I’m okay, just… freaked out.”

He was instantly alert. “Where exactly? Shelter name? What was he wearing?”

I told him what I could—orange clothes, near Bennington, heading north.

“I’ll call it in,” he said firmly. “You keep moving. Call me if anything changes.”

The adrenaline faded to exhaustion. My legs felt heavy, shaky. When a trail runner appeared behind me, I flinched so hard I nearly tripped.

“Whoa! You good?” he asked, stopping short.

“Sorry,” I said, breath ragged. “Weird guy back at the shelter. Tried to get me to come over—said something crazy. Be careful.”

“Thanks for the heads-up,” he said, eyes wide. “I’ll let others know.”

Calls started rolling in. First Fresh Ground: “Heard you had a scare. You okay?”

“Barely,” I said, trying to laugh it off.

Then the Forest Service officer: “Your dad called. We’re heading there now. Describe him again?”

I did, every detail etched into my mind—the calm voice, the orange jacket, the setting.

“You did right running,” he said. “We’ll check it out. Keep moving north.”

By the time I reached Goddard, snow still clung to the ground in deep drifts. Each step punched through, soaking my legs to the thighs. The post-holing was brutal—slow, cold, and endless. My feet were numb, socks squishing with icy water. Darkness crept in fast.

When I finally reached Kid Gore Shelter, it was empty. Just me, the wind, and the faint creak of trees. I dropped my pack and sat on the wooden platform, shaking—not just from cold, but from everything that had happened.

I ate a handful of trail mix, sipped from my water bottle, and wrote in my journal with stiff fingers. The man’s voice still echoed in my head: *Come here. Someone’s trying to poison me.*

Later, I heard through updates: they found him. Dead. Maybe poisoned, just like he’d said.

That truth chilled me deeper than anything else could. Out here, between solitude and silence, you learn fast that instinct isn’t paranoia—it’s protection.

And that day, listening to it might’ve saved my life.





# ""The Edge of Thirst"":

I’d always loved pushing my limits. In 1994, at thirty-nine, I signed up for the Marathon des Sables — a six-day, 251-kilometer race across the scorching Sahara Desert in Morocco. It was called *the toughest footrace on Earth* for a reason. You carried everything on your back — food, gear, and the will to survive.

The morning I left Italy, Cinzia’s eyes said more than words ever could. She held me close, her voice trembling.  
“Mauro, promise you’ll be careful,” she whispered. “The desert doesn’t forgive mistakes.”

I smiled, kissed her, and said, “I’ll be fine. This is what I’ve trained for.”  
My friend Giovanni was running too, and we laughed about crossing the finish line together. I had no idea how far fate was about to push me.

The first few days felt almost glorious. Eighty of us began as one long, determined line cutting through the dunes, but soon we spread across the vast emptiness. I kept a steady pace, sipping water at checkpoints, rationing dried food, counting every calorie. By day three, I’d covered nearly a hundred kilometers and was in seventh place. Giovanni had fallen behind, but I pressed forward, feeling strong, unstoppable — like I was finally touching the edge of something greater than myself.

Then came day four — the longest stage: over eighty kilometers. I started early, cutting across a series of low dunes to save time. The sky was clear at first, the horizon endless. But by midday, the wind picked up, a whisper that turned into a roar.

Sand began to sting my face, the air thickening until I could barely breathe. I wrapped my scarf around my nose, squinting through the storm. Soon, visibility vanished — not even my outstretched hand existed anymore. I trudged forward blindly, convinced the course markers had to be just ahead.

The sandstorm lasted eight relentless hours. When it finally cleared near dusk, I looked around and felt my stomach drop. There was nothing. No flags. No footprints. No sound but the wind. Just the desert — vast, silent, and merciless.

I climbed a dune, scanning every direction. Nothing. I was lost.

I fought the rising panic. The race rules said to stay put if lost, so I did. I had a liter of water left, a few scraps of food, and my sleeping bag. I found a small bush for shelter and wrapped myself tight as the desert cooled. The silence was unbearable, broken only by the hiss of shifting sand. “They’ll find me soon,” I whispered. “They have helicopters.”

But the night stretched endlessly, and no one came.

By morning, thirst gnawed at me like an animal. I started walking again, praying for a marker, a sign, anything. The sun rose higher, burning my skin raw. My water ran low. I filled an empty bottle with urine, staring at it in disgust, knowing I might have to drink it later. I climbed dune after dune, each one revealing only more sand.

Then — a faint thudding in the sky. A helicopter. My heart leapt. I waved, fired my signal flare — a brilliant streak of red that barely glowed under the brutal daylight. The helicopter passed overhead and kept going. It didn’t see me.

That’s when despair hit. I dropped to my knees, sand slipping through my fingers. “No one knows where I am.”

I waited out the heat, then set my compass west, thinking I might stumble back toward the route. Hours blurred into a haze of pain and heat. By late afternoon, I spotted something — a shape on the horizon. A structure. I forced my legs to move. It turned out to be an ancient marabout, a small Muslim shrine. Abandoned, crumbling, but it had shade. I collapsed inside.

That night, I faced a new reality. My last food gone, my water almost empty, I lit my stove using urine as fuel to cook the final crumbs of rations. The stench was unbearable, but I forced it down. Hunger clawed at me until I noticed bats roosting in the ceiling shadows. I caught a few with my knife, biting into the raw flesh. It was metallic, vile — but it kept me alive.

Days blurred together in that tomb-like place. I planted my small Italian flag on the roof — a signal, or maybe a grave marker. I wrote a final message to Cinzia and our children on the wall with a piece of charcoal:  
*“I love you. Forgive me for not coming home.”*

One afternoon, I heard an engine — a plane. My heart pounded as I ran outside, arranging rocks into an SOS, lighting my backpack straps to make smoke. But then, as if mocking me, another sandstorm rose, erasing everything.

By the fourth day, my body began to shut down. My skin cracked, my urine turned thick and dark. I couldn’t think clearly anymore. I lay on the ground, tears mixing with dust. “It’s better to end it now,” I thought. “At least Cinzia will get the pension.”

I took my knife and cut my wrists. The pain was sharp but strangely distant. I waited for darkness.

But morning came. I was still alive. My blood was too thick to flow. The cuts had clotted. I stared at my wrists and laughed — a dry, broken sound. “If I can’t even die,” I thought, “then I’m meant to live.”

Something changed then. I tore strips from my shirt to bind the wounds, gathered what little strength I had left, and set out again. I walked at dawn and dusk, resting through the burning hours. I drank dew, chewed on roots, and ate insects and small snakes I caught at night. Each day became a battle of minutes — every step forward a victory.

Sometimes mirages taunted me — shimmering oases that vanished when I reached them. My feet were blistered and bleeding. My mind fractured under the silence. I talked to myself constantly.  
“One more dune, Mauro. One more. Think of the kids.”

After nearly nine days, I stumbled upon a patch of green — a tiny oasis. A muddy puddle. I dropped to my knees, scooping water in trembling hands. I vomited the first mouthful, my body rejecting the shock of moisture. But I kept trying until it stayed down. I cried from relief.

Then I saw something in the sand — goat droppings. Then footprints. My heart thudded weakly. I followed them until I saw a little girl, no older than eight, herding goats.

“Water…” I croaked. “Help…”

She turned, eyes wide, and screamed, sprinting away. “Wait!” I called, my voice cracking.

Minutes later, she returned with an older woman, her grandmother perhaps. The woman eyed me warily but with pity. She gestured for me to follow. I obeyed, stumbling behind her to a small camp. They gave me goat’s milk, which I drank slowly, and then mint tea. I could barely speak. They tended my wounds and wrapped me in blankets.

When the men returned, they lifted me onto a camel and took me to a military outpost. At first, the soldiers thought I might be a spy. They blindfolded me, interrogated me in French.  
“Who are you?” one demanded.

“Mauro Prosperi,” I rasped. “Italian. Lost runner.”

When they confirmed my story, they drove me to a hospital in Tindouf, Algeria. I had crossed nearly three hundred kilometers off course.

The doctors pumped sixteen liters of fluid into me. My liver was failing. I’d lost sixteen kilograms — nearly a quarter of my weight. But I was alive.

When I finally called Cinzia, her voice broke with disbelief. “Mauro? They said you were gone.”

I couldn’t stop crying. “I’m coming home,” I said. “I survived.”

Nine days alone in the desert changed me forever. The Sahara stripped me of everything — pride, strength, fear — until all that was left was the instinct to survive. I walked through hell, but I came back. And sometimes, when I close my eyes, I still hear the wind of that endless, burning sea of sand — and remember how close I came to becoming one with it.





# ""Ten More Steps"":

I’d hiked those trails more times than I could count—the ones winding through the valleys and forests just minutes from home. That afternoon, I felt the pull again, that restless need to move, to breathe quiet air and feel the ground under my boots. I packed light: some food, a towel, my pepper spray clipped to my belt. The reserve was familiar, a tangle of green hills and a river cutting through the lowlands. No real dangers there—no bears, no cougars—just birds, wind, and silence.

I signed in at the entrance, followed the dirt road, and parked at the trailhead. The descent began steep, zigzagging through tall grass into denser woods where sunlight broke into shards. I walked slow, breathing in the forest’s damp scent, the rustle of leaves echoing like whispers. A side path drew me off the main trail—the one leading to that old wooden lookout on stilts, long abandoned. Its empty windows always unsettled me, staring out like hollow eyes, but curiosity won again. I passed it, crossed to the river, and stripped down to swim in the cold pools.

The water shocked my skin awake. Beneath the surface, it was clear and quiet—just the ripple of my breath. I floated a while, then sat on a smooth rock eating an apple, watching the current slide past. Two people appeared on the far bank and kept going, and when their footsteps faded, I had the place to myself again.

After drying off and dressing, I started back along the river’s flat trail. The forest was still, shadows lengthening. When I turned toward the path up to the ridge, I stopped. Two men stood ahead.

They weren’t hikers—no packs, no proper boots—and they had dogs running loose. Dogs weren’t allowed here. When they saw me, they turned quickly, heading off in the opposite direction. My first thought was poachers. They’d been a problem lately, sneaking in to chase deer or snare whatever they could.

I waited a few minutes to give them distance, then continued. The trail curved through a stand of trees—and there they were again, waiting.

They smiled as I approached, too casual. I forced calm into my voice.  
“I hope you’re not poaching,” I said.

One shook his head. “No, we’re looking for our dog. Lost one somewhere.”

I didn’t believe him. Still, I nodded and walked past, planning to reach my car fast and report it at the gate. The trail narrowed, hemmed by brush. I heard footsteps behind me—then the soft panting of a dog. When I glanced back, it was right at my heels, sniffing close.

“Call your dog,” I said over my shoulder. No response.

Then a low voice, closer than I expected: “Give us your bag or you’ll die here.”

My hands went cold. I didn’t turn. I reached for the pepper spray, still clipped at my side. My mind ran fast—don’t run, don’t freeze, think. The crunch of footsteps quickened.

The second man moved up beside me. His tone was almost gentle. “I want sex,” he said. “Please, I want sex.”

“No.” My voice was sharp. “I don’t know you. Leave me alone.”

He reached for me, fingers brushing my arm, then lower. Something inside me snapped tight. “Go,” I said, pointing past them. “Go before I hurt you.”

They grinned. The look in their eyes wasn’t play anymore.

I started walking again, heart hammering, every nerve alive. The next sound was a rush of boots behind me—then impact. A body slammed into my back, arms clamping around my waist. I twisted, refusing to fall, years of boxing reflexes kicking in. I elbowed hard, spun free.

“Give us sex or we’ll kill you!” one shouted.

The first blow came fast, his fist cracking against my cheekbone. White pain burst behind my eye. I hit back, my left hook connecting solidly with his jaw. He stumbled. I yanked out the pepper spray and fired, but the mist drifted wide. The second man knocked it from my hand, and then they both came at me.

It was chaos—shoving, fists, grunts. I aimed for throats, eyes, anything soft. One caught my arm, wrenched me down hard. My face hit dirt, and his boot pressed on my cheek, grinding me into the earth.

“Don’t scream,” he said.

I hadn’t. Not yet. But now I did—loud, raw, tearing my throat. The sound vanished into the valley, swallowed by distance. The other man knelt between my legs, fingers tearing at fabric, his intent unmistakable. Terror hit deep, cold and clear.

Something primal surged up—a refusal, pure and bright. I drew my knee back and kicked him full in the chest. He flew backward, gasping. The boot on my face lifted; I rolled, kicked again, scrambled to my feet.

“Let’s just go,” one hissed. “Forget it.”

They ran, grabbing my backpack, their dogs tearing after them. I dropped to my knees, shaking, dirt caked to my face, blood in my mouth. My eye throbbed, my ribs burned. I crawled into thick brush, curled small, every sound amplified—the snap of a twig, the hiss of wind through reeds. Were they coming back? I didn’t know.

Minutes—or maybe hours—passed in a blur of heartbeat and panic. I couldn’t stay. They’d said they’d kill me, and I believed them.

I forced myself up, found a slope tangled with thorns and vines, and began to climb. My hands bled where I gripped rock and root, but I didn’t stop. Inside, two voices warred—the small one whispering, *I’m tired, I can’t*, and the other, calm and motherly: *You can. Keep going. Ten more steps.*

I counted those steps like prayers. At the top, I stumbled onto a clearing—fresh timber shelters, a water tap gleaming in the sun. I hid first, listening. Nothing. Then I drank, slow gulps, the water tasting like salvation.

I wanted to collapse, but I knew better. The sun was sinking. I followed the faint trail upward through dry grass until it broke onto a dirt road. My body screamed now, every bruise awake. My keys were gone with my bag, but I walked anyway—down the road’s center, gripping a pointed stick like a spear.

An engine approached from behind. I turned, waving. A car slowed—a couple inside. The woman rolled down the window, eyes widening at the sight of me.

“Please,” I said. “I’ve been attacked.”

She gasped. “Did they—did they rape you?”

“No.” My voice cracked. “But they tried.”

They helped me in, drove me home to my mother’s house. I had a spare key there; later, they retrieved my car. At the hospital, doctors traced the marks—boot tread on my cheek, finger-shaped bruises along my arms. Police took my statement, my description. I remembered every detail of their faces, those grins turning predatory.

For days, I barely slept. Showers came in threes, sometimes fours. Crowds made my chest tighten. But I forced myself back to the reserve—this time with friends. We climbed the cliffs above the same valley, and for a few moments, I felt the fear loosen its hold.

They’d taken something from me that day—peace, safety—but not everything. I fought. I walked away.

Now, years later, the memory still flickers: the dog’s breath on my legs, the dirt in my teeth, the sound of their laughter. The sharp stone in my palm as I climbed. The shock of cold water on my tongue.

It’s frightening, how fast peace turns to terror—how one bend in the trail can change a life. But when I think back, I don’t remember the fear most. I remember the climb. The voice that said: *Keep going.*

And I did.

They ran.  
I walked home.





# ""The Follower"":

I’d been looking forward to that solo camping trip for weeks. Work had been draining, the kind that leaves you staring at walls, feeling the need to disappear for a while. So I decided to unplug completely—head deep into the Washington backcountry, to one of those forgotten forest pockets where no one ever goes.

I packed light but smart: tent, food, a map, compass, and a small knife clipped to my belt. Drove out before sunrise, the road twisting through miles of pine and fog until it narrowed into an old, half-overgrown logging track. I parked by a pull-off, stepped out into silence so pure it almost rang in my ears, and started hiking.

By midafternoon, I’d gone about ten miles in. The trail faded into mossy forest and damp soil, the kind that smells ancient. I found a flat clearing near a small stream, tucked between tall firs—a perfect camp spot. The air was cool, clean, still. I built a small fire, cooked some beans, watched the flames crackle low as the forest dimmed into darkness.

When I finally zipped into my tent, the quiet was absolute—no cars, no planes, just the faint trickle of water nearby. I drifted off fast.

Sometime after midnight, I woke to a sound. Rustling. Soft but deliberate, close. At first, I thought it was a raccoon or deer nosing around. I listened—steady steps, slow, crunching leaves just beyond the tent.

I unzipped the flap an inch, flicked on my flashlight.

There—sitting where my fire had been—was a man.

He was crouched low, poking at the ashes with a stick, his face faintly lit by the beam. Jeans, dark hoodie, no pack, no camping gear. Just… sitting there. His head turned toward the light, eyes catching the reflection, wide for a heartbeat—and then he bolted. Shot up and vanished into the trees, crashing through the dark.

“Hey!” I shouted, voice cracking. “What are you doing?”

Nothing. Only the sound of branches settling.

I sat frozen, flashlight darting over shadows, the silence pressing in again. Eventually, I convinced myself it was nothing—maybe some drifter, lost or high, wandered by mistake. Still, I barely slept the rest of the night.

In the morning, I checked around. No clear footprints—the ground was too dry. I broke camp quickly and hiked deeper into the wilderness, maybe five miles farther, off any marked trail. Found another spot by a ridge, with a sweeping view of endless forest. It felt better there—open, bright, far from wherever that man had come from.

The day passed quietly. I explored, picked some berries, read by the stream. The forest felt peaceful again, almost kind. I started to believe I’d overreacted.

That night, I built another small fire and sat until the last glow faded. The stars came out sharp through the branches. Around midnight, I heard it again—soft movement in the dark. But this time, it wasn’t random. It circled. Twigs snapped, a branch creaked, deliberate steps shifting around my camp.

“Who’s there?” I called out.

For a moment, silence. Then, a man’s voice from the dark—steady, low, and too calm.

“You know the way to Eagle Pass?”

I froze. “What?”

“Eagle Pass,” he said again. “You know how to get there?”

“I don’t,” I said carefully. “You lost?”

“Maybe.” He paused. “You been out here long?”

My throat tightened. “Couple days. You need help?”

“No,” he said. “Light bothers my eyes.”

My flashlight scanned the trees. Nothing but trunks and shadows.

“You seen any old cabins out this way?” he asked next. “Ones with red doors?”

I didn’t answer at first. The question was too strange, too specific. “No cabins around here,” I said finally. “Why?”

He didn’t reply. Just shifted, closer now.

Then, again: “What about the river fork with the big boulders? You know how to get there from here?”

Each question came slow, measured, like he was testing me. My skin crawled.

“You alone out here?” he asked.

I hesitated. “Yeah,” I said, instantly regretting it. “But friends know where I am.”

A soft chuckle floated from the dark. “Good to have friends.”

That broke something in me. I raised the flashlight and swept it hard across the trees—and there he was. Twenty feet away, half hidden behind a trunk. Same jeans. Same hoodie. The same man from the first night.

My stomach dropped. How the hell had he found me? I’d hiked random directions, no trail, no markers. There was no way.

He flinched as the beam hit his face, then darted off again, vanishing into the black.

I shouted, “Stay away from me!” My voice echoed uselessly. I tore down my tent in minutes, hands shaking, ready to leave—but it was pitch dark. No moon, no clear path. I sat up all night beside the dying fire, knife in my hand, listening.

Nothing came. But I didn’t sleep at all.

At dawn, I packed up and started back toward my car—moving fast, doubling back, stopping to watch the treeline every few minutes. The woods no longer felt vast and peaceful. They felt claustrophobic, every rustle turning my heart over.

Eight miles in, I stopped to rest, then set up a bare camp in a thicket—no fire this time. I lay there in the dark, waiting, listening.

Around two in the morning, I heard footsteps again. Slow, steady. Circling my tent.

I whispered, “I know you’re there. Leave me alone.”

Silence—then movement, deliberate, around and around. My pulse pounded so loud I could barely hear. He was playing with me.

I gripped the knife tighter, barely breathing, until the sound finally drifted away.

The next day was worse. Every step, I imagined him behind me. My legs burned, lungs ached, but I didn’t stop. “Just get to the car,” I kept muttering. “Get to the car.”

That night, I tried to rest once more, too exhausted to go on. But this time, it wasn’t footsteps. It was a sound in the distance—an owl call. Only wrong. Too drawn out, too human. Then a whistle, echoing faintly from another direction. Then again, closer.

He was mimicking birds now. Signaling.

“What do you want?” I yelled. My voice cracked in the dark.

No answer—just that same warped call, softer, almost playful.

Before dawn, I was already hiking. My legs felt rubbery, but I didn’t stop. When I finally broke through the trees and saw the glint of metal—the roof of my car down the logging road—I almost cried.

I ran the last half mile, stumbling, heart hammering. When I reached it, I threw my gear in, slammed the doors, locked them all. Then I drove—fast, not looking back, dust rising behind me like smoke.

In the rearview mirror, the forest slid away. I half expected to see him step out from the trees as I left, watching me go.

I didn’t stop until I reached a town an hour later. Checked into a motel, locked the door, and finally let myself breathe.

I never went back to those woods.

Told a friend later that I’d had a weird encounter—left out the rest. What could I even say? That some man hunted me through the forest for three nights, asking about places that don’t exist? There’s no proof, no harm done.

But I know what I heard. I know what I saw. And I know, if I’d stayed just one more night out there, I wouldn’t have made it out at all.",1,1762491618.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I used to have a Breville Dual Boiler (1800W) that worked fine on my counter in the kitchen. It was old, so time to replace, but never tripped the GFCI. 

I have now had 2 Lelit Anna machines (1050W) both run for about a minute then trip. Then from there they trip it immediately each time I turn the machine on. 

Confused - shouldn’t the lower wattage mean the new machine should run fine on the same outlet? Any ideas here?

Thanks!

** Edit - learning here the wattage is irrelevant. Just seems wild I’ve gotten 2 machines with ground faults out of the box. I did not spill water or anything when setting either up. I did however just try the machine in my basement instead - tripped that GFCI too. 

Assuming this means some kind of flaw with the machines - time to look for something else? One issue I can live with but this is two now and it’s nuts to need 3 machines to get a single cup of coffee. ",1,1762491597.0,AskElectricians,8,1.0,False

I'm Sami and I'm a 21 years old (F).

I'll go straight up to the topic, l'm desperate for friends. My husband works 24/7 since he's a military man. Don't get me wrong guys, I love my husband and he is my best friend in the whole world, sadly because of his job he is almost always gone:( l'm a stay at home wife and I always had a huge struggle to make friends, to everyone I look like a ""very social person"" however I always find myself with no one to talk to... I have started to wonder if there's just something about me that's wrong or if I'm just worrying about this topic too much atm. Besides my husband I have 4 other friends. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety ever since I was in my last job so the few friends I made eventually moved out to other cities or countries and tried to make more friends in the area since I still struggle with depression and I desire to be better and a stable environment (that's what my therapist said I should do, have friends Imao).

I'm a full time artist now and I have realized that I want friends to have phone calls with, I want to go out and have coffee, walk around with friends, eat out together, maybe even go hiking! But I have no friends to do this with, all my few friends are either in the states or somewhere actually far away and I feel desperate however I have no clue how to socialize properly and no clue of where to start to get a nice and sincere friendship.

Does anyone have any advice or ideas for my situation? ",1,1762491475.0,FriendshipAdvice,4,1.0,False
1oqli9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/FAFSA/comments/1oqli9u/school_possibly_holding_funds_hostage_due_to/,school possibly holding funds hostage due to discrimination,"TL:DR I am being asked for marriage status verification in an extremely shady way and feel it is a form of discrimination or fuckery related to my marriage status in a red state. Does this seem legit or not?



I'm a female veteran in my late 30's. I have been divorced since the 2010. I have gone to two different schools, the first one a few different times between 2011 and 2016, and this one. I have never put that I was married on the FAFSA form, always put divorced from the very first time. Nothing has changed in my forms or tax filings. 



I live in a red state. Earlier this year the Presidential Administration released some executive orders that prompted the VA to change some of it's discrimination policy's wording in such a way that it appears as if discrimination is now acceptable against everything from race to marriage status(not here to debate that). 



A few weeks after the VA changes came to light, I get a message from my school's finance department saying I need to verify my marital status. I called and was like, what's up with this? Dude says its not them its FAFSA. I call FAFSA, they say its not them, I haven't made any changes I'm good. I call the school. They tell me its part of their verification for FAFSA and that I can just write when I got divorced on a piece of paper, sign it, and upload it and I'll be good. 



I've been dealing with the government since I was 19, never not once would a government agency accept a random piece of paper for official documentation. If they had asked for a copy of my divorce decree, I would have been annoyed but been like, whatever and done it. But the initial denial of responsibility, this ridiculousness of 'write it however', and the timing are just too much. I'm not typically a paranoid person, but.... 

  
I sat on it for a few weeks and then called back asking for specific statutes that show where and why this verification is necessary and can be a coffee stained post it note and still count. Explain how I don't think this is on the up and up and why. In the 45 minutes I was on the phone, the lady described what I needed three times. Every time she explained it, different information was required. 



That did not put my mind at ease that this red state school was not singling out a single divorced woman. 



I asked her if she could email the statue numbers or links to websites because she said she didn't have them in front of her. She said I should call and talk to the verification department specifically(that was already closed) because she didn't think I would accept any information on the school's letterhead. o\_0  If they are federal government statutes, I should be able to find them on government websites. In what way would specific letterhead come into play? 



I didn't really need the money and had a ton of personal shit going down so I just ignored it. Then, I did need it and uploaded a picture with the last iteration of information. And they rejected it because they didn't like how I wrote one of the numbers(in their defense my handwriting can be shit). I recently uploaded a pdf with the information and a hand drawn electronic signature. I did that exact same signature on other verification documents at the beginning of all this verification crap. To start school all the documents were e-signed. Everything I have done with his school has been electronic, but now, it has to be identifiably a signature with an ink pen? 

  
This all feels really shady and like an attempt to be discriminatory. Has anyone else seen this? She mentioned multiple times a 'change in martial status,' there has been no change in over a decade. Is this a real thing or do I spend too much time online and need to just do it how they want?

Finally at the end of the meal they all get up and George faces her. He notices she has a huge piece of spinach stuck in her teeth. 

She notices he ""made a face"" and claims its because she has adult braces. 

Woman: ""you're a bracist!"" 

George: ""No I'm not! I didn't even notice!""

Woman's friend: ""I saw you. You're a vain, shallow man""

Meanwhile Kramer gets stainless steel mugs after dropping a ceramic one. First he deals with temperature issues as the handles are scalding hot. 

Them he starts wearing gloves to drink it. 

But the mugs are heavy (5lbs) and he inadvertently gets used to the weight 

Then he makes coffee at Jerry's with a plain ceramic mug. He is too strong and hits himself right in the face with it, chipping his tooth and giving himself a swollen lip.

Everywhere he goes people look at him differently, with fear and respect. Elaine let's him know he looks like he just got in a fight. 

Kramer decides to play up his tough guy persona 

Elaine meanwhile has a boyfriend who has a home office. One day they're talking as he's finishing up his work and she sees him put away a file. 

She sees a file labeled ""Elaine"" and asks what's in it. 

He says she must have misread it and its nothing to do with her.

He locks the cabinet though. 

Jerry is dating a girl with fantastic hearing.

She hears him planning a surprise for her on the phone in another room

She hears a snide remark under his breath

She hears him sneak candy when they're both supposed to be on a diet 

She insists the TV volume be no higher than 8 because it's ""deafening""

-- Elaine asks Kramer to use his new tough guy contacts to break into the apartment and into the filing cabinet

1oqlgh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xpeng/comments/1oqlgh1/is_the_white_interior_easy_to_maintain/,Is the white interior easy to maintain?,"Hi everybody, I’m planning to buy an XpengG6 in December of this year however, I have a couple of concerns. 

I’m planning to get the silver white exterior and the white color interior but I’m not very sure if the white color interior is one that will stay clean for a long time.  Mostly I am  not somebody who tends to eat in my car or you know things get dirty, but I do love my coffee and when I see the white cupholders and everything that is white around it, it does get me a little concerned if it’s a good idea to get the white interior. So if anybody has a white color interior X peng G6 any recommendations on how you keep the car clean and how do you possibly make sure that the car doesn’t stain if something spilled in it. Also if the white is good for long term use or is the darker interior still the safest option? The thing is the white is so beautiful that it’s hard to pass but if it’s very hard to maintain I think it’s safer to go for black. Do let me know and thank you for your replies 🙏🏾",3,1762491293.0,Xpeng,2,1.0,False

# EV Dealerships vs. Food Franchises: Which Is the Smarter Bet for 2026?

# FKW - Which Franchise to Buy?

 

India 2026. Two industries are speeding ahead one powered by engines, the other by ovens. On one side, the EV dealership revolution is charging across cities, driven by policy support and the shift to clean mobility. On the other, food franchises continue sizzling, feeding India’s growing appetite for comfort, convenience, and indulgence. But the real question for aspiring entrepreneurs and investors remains  which one’s the smarter bet, which franchise to buy?

This FKW playbook compares both, side-by-side, through India’s economic, cultural, and policy lens  helping you decide where your next crore should go.

# India’s 2026 Business Landscape - The Decade of Reinvention

India’s entrepreneurial spirit has never been stronger. With a GDP nearing $4.5 trillion, rising disposable incomes, and a digitally connected youth, 2026 marks the peak of a new franchise boom.

●       Two sectors : Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Food & Beverage

●       (F&B) : lead this transformation, each representing a different kind of stability:

●       EV dealerships stand for innovation, sustainability, and government-driven scalability.

●       Food franchises represent trust, familiarity, and timeless consumer demand.

Both are expanding but not equally. EVs are galloping faster because policy meets profit. Meanwhile, F&B remains a dependable cash flow generator.

# Understanding the EV Dealership Opportunity Before Deciding Which Franchise To Buy

The Indian EV market has grown at over 80% CAGR since 2021, driven by government incentives like FAME-II and state EV subsidies. By 2026, the goal is 30% of all new vehicles sold to be electric.

That means thousands of dealerships, service hubs, and battery-swapping centers will need franchise partners.

Why It’s Gaining Traction

●       Government Backing: GST cut to 5%, road tax waivers, and EV-friendly financing.

●       Rising Fuel Prices: Push consumers toward electric two-wheelers and cars.

●       New Brands: Ola Electric, Ather, [**Tata Motors EV**](http://www.franchisebazar.com/), MG, and BYD are opening dealership partnerships.

●       Tech Momentum: AI-based battery analytics, solar charging integration, and smart mobility systems.

In short, the EV dealership sector is not just profitable, it's policy-proof.

# Food Franchises – India’s Everlasting Appetite- Watch When You Are Deciding Which Franchise To Buy

From KFC to Wow! Momo, India’s QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) industry is worth over ₹70,000 crore in 2026.

No matter how tech evolves, Indians will always eat.

Food franchises thrive on emotion and repetition — coffee breaks, birthday pizzas, family dinners. These habits create repeat customers and predictable earnings.

Why It’s Still Attractive

●       Low customer education needed everyone to understand food.

●       High repeat business and loyalty programs.

●       Digital ordering and delivery apps make expansion easy.

●       Established names like Domino’s, KFC, and Haldiram’s offer structured franchise systems.

So yes, food is evergreen. But unlike EV dealerships, it’s crowded and price-sensitive.

# Comparing Entry Costs While Deciding Which Franchise To Buy

Let’s break down what it actually takes to start each.

# EV Dealership:

●       Investment: ₹50 lakh – ₹2 crore (depending on brand and city).

●       Space: 800 – 1500 sq ft showroom + test area.

●       Profit Margin: 10–15% on vehicle sales, up to 25% on accessories or charging services.

●       Breakeven Period: Around 2–3 years.

# Food Franchise:

●       Investment: ₹80 lakh – ₹2.5 crore (for leading brands like KFC, Pizza Hut, or Domino’s).

●       Space: 600 – 1200 sq ft for dine-in, smaller for kiosks.

●       Profit Margin: 15–20%, though food costs and rent affect returns.

●       Breakeven Period: 3–5 years.

Verdict: EV dealerships need lower manpower, less wastage, and recover faster if placed in growing urban clusters.

# Scalability – Which Expands Faster?

The scalability question decides long-term wealth.

# EV Dealerships:

●       Scale through multi-brand showrooms or adding service centers.

●       Low dependence on chefs or kitchen operations.

●       New state EV policies mean every city needs at least 5–10 authorized dealers by 2027.

●       Can expand horizontally into charging stations, fleet leasing, or accessories.

# Food Franchises:

●       Require strong operational teams and inventory consistency.

●       Expansion limited by location saturation  one KFC every few kilometers.

●       Scaling requires multi-unit management and higher rentals.

●        EV franchises scale wider, faster, and cheaper.

# Risk and Regulation Check

Every business carries risks -  some manageable, some unpredictable.

# EV Risks:

●       Battery disposal concerns (regulated by CPCB).

●       Dependence on brand technology and maintenance training.

●       Still-evolving resale market.

# Food Risks:

●       Ingredient inflation (wheat, cheese, poultry).

●       Food licensing and health compliances (FSSAI).

●       Staff turnover and hygiene audits.

While food is mature and regulated, EV risks are front-loaded once infrastructure is set, operations stabilize faster.

# Consumer Behavior 2026 – The Real Decider For Which Franchise To Buy

●       Indian consumers in 2026 are defined by convenience + conscience.

●       The new middle class wants guilt-free consumption -  eco-friendly vehicles, organic food, renewable energy.

●       Gen Z and Millennials are brand-loyal but value-conscious.

●       They spend on experiences that align with values  sustainability, tech, transparency.

That’s why EV dealerships resonate stronger; they tick the environmental, aspirational, and tech boxes at once.

Food satisfies the heart, but EVs excite the mind.

# Profit Potential – The Numbers Game That Helps You Choose Which Franchise To Buy

# EV Dealerships:

●       Average ROI between 20–30% annually after setup.

●       Multiple revenue streams: vehicle sales, charging, service, financing commissions.

●       Low variable costs once the infrastructure is set.

# Food Franchises:

●       ROI around 15–20%, depending on rent and food inflation.

●       Sales fluctuate seasonally (festivals, weekends).

●       Ongoing raw material and staff costs reduce margins.

# Example:

A well-run Ather or Tata EV showroom in a tier-1 city can clock ₹15–20 lakh monthly sales within a year.

A QSR outlet may reach similar numbers but requires higher operating costs.

# Sustainability and Future Policy Support

This is the defining factor for the next decade.

●       EV Industry: FAME-II incentives and PLI schemes extend till 2027.

●       States like Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Delhi offer direct EV subsidies.

●       100% electrification goals for public transport push massive demand.

●       Battery recycling rules add a new business vertical.

# [**Food Industry**](http://www.sparkleminds.com/):

●       No major policy tailwind; it’s a stable consumer-driven sector.

●       Growing regulatory focus on food safety and packaging waste.

●       The Indian government is betting big on EVs  and so should smart entrepreneurs.

# Franchise Structure and Support

# EV Dealerships (Ola Electric, Ather, Tata):

●       Provide end-to-end setup, training, digital CRM, and exclusive territory rights.

●       Usually it takes 3–4 months from application to launch.

●       Offer strong branding, financing assistance, and green marketing campaigns.

# Food Franchises (KFC, Haldiram’s, Subway):

●       Have mature SOPs, centralized supply chains, and 24×7 brand recall.

●       Require more operational control and quality checks.

●       Both offer training and structure, but EV brands give more operational autonomy and that attracts younger, tech-driven entrepreneurs.

# Funding and Investor Sentiment

The market is voting with its money.

●       In 2025, EV start-ups raised over $2.5 billion in India compared to $800 million in food-tech (Swiggy, Zomato, Rebel Foods combined).

●       Venture capital and banks now classify EVs as priority lending sectors.

●       Major NBFCs are offering franchise loans for green tech dealerships.

●       Food remains stable for retail investors  but EVs are scaling with institutional fuel.

# Market Trends to Watch in 2026

●       **EVs**: Battery-swapping networks, charging-as-a-service, micro-mobility (E-bikes).

●       **Food:** Cloud kitchens, plant-based menus, AI-driven delivery optimization.

●       **Overlap:** EV food trucks are the next hybrid model for sustainability.

Both are adapting fast, but EVs have a longer runway of disruption left.

# Challenges for Both Industries

# For EVs:

●       Dependence on charging infrastructure growth.

●       Need for skilled technicians.

●       Initial consumer skepticism about range and service cost.

For Food:

●       Intense competition and discount wars.

●       Staff retention and hygiene maintenance.

●       Delivery aggregator dependency reducing profits.

While food franchises face “crowded kitchen syndrome,” EV dealerships face “infant industry risk.” The difference? The latter improves with time.

# The Hybrid Investor Mindset

Many modern entrepreneurs are blending both worlds running food franchises for steady cash flow and investing in EV dealerships for capital appreciation.

●       This dual approach diversifies revenue and stabilizes returns.

●       For instance, one can operate a local EV dealership and simultaneously franchise a small café or beverage brand inside the showroom premises  sustainability meets lifestyle.

Such cross-sector thinking defines the 2026 entrepreneurial mindset.

# The Smarter Pick – Where 2026 Is Heading

Let’s be real food forever. But EVs are the future.

Why EV Dealerships Win the 2026 Bet:

●       Backed by national policy, not just personal taste.

●       Easier to scale with low manpower and zero perishables.

●       High-tech image attracts investors and customers alike.

●       Expanding beyond cars  into scooters, commercial fleets, and charging solutions.

●       Aligned with India’s 2070 net-zero vision.

Food franchises remain excellent for steady income and local branding. But if you’re betting on where India is going, not where it’s been, EV dealerships take the pole position.

# The Balanced Investor’s Note

In the end, your choice depends on your personality:

●       If you love community, hospitality, and customer interaction → go for food.

●       If you love tech, clean energy, and scalability → go for EVs.

Both can coexist in your portfolio. But when it comes to long-term compounding the battery beats the burger.

**The smartest investment isn’t in a product or plate, it's in the trend that never runs out of charge.**

1oqla9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1oqla9e/dear_future_husband/,Dear Future Husband,"Before I ever knew your name, I prayed for your soul.
I asked God to steady your heart, to make you brave enough to love a woman like me — one who has walked through storms and still believes in sunlight.

I love God more than I will ever love you — and that’s how I’ll know our love is safe. He will be our foundation, the heartbeat beneath our laughter, the calm beneath every wave. My boys are my world, and one day, if you are kind enough, they’ll be yours too.

I love music — all kinds. I’ll dance in the kitchen with no warning, barefoot and free, twirling like the little girl I used to be. I’ll expect you to join me, even if you don’t know how. And if you ever hear a song playing on repeat, know that my spirit is sorting through something tender. That’s when I’ll need your arms — not your answers.

I clean often, but I am not a maid. I host with joy and imagination — candles, music, too many snacks, and all the little touches that make people feel seen. Roll with me on this; it’s how I love. Family means everything to me — blood and chosen alike.

I write endlessly. Words are how I breathe. If you don’t like to read, you soon will, because I’ll write short stories just for you. Notes tucked into pockets, on mirrors, around your coffee cup. I’ll remind you what love sounds like when spoken softly.

And when I’m upset — you’ll know. I’m direct, sometimes too much. But I’ll always tell you the truth. I live with depression and deep, old wounds that make me flinch at raised voices. Please, speak gently. My spirit blooms best in peace.

In our home, I dream of a library — shelves of books I’ve written, and a little coffee nook inside. Caramel latte, extra caramel, extra whip. Cinnamon Dolce with a slice of banana or pumpkin bread. That’s how I slow down.

I love long walks, strangers’ stories, the wisdom of elders, and the wonder of children. My car will be messy — that’s just the truth — but if you clean it for me, I’ll bake you my best cheesecake from scratch. Deal?

I love to bake. I love sushi. I don’t drink. I am a teacher at heart, a giver by nature. My weakness is the broken and the forgotten — I pour myself out for them without apology. Some say I give too much. I say love was never meant to be measured.

So, if you find me one day — know this: I’m not looking for perfection. I’m looking for partnership. I don’t need to be saved, only seen. I don’t need to be completed, only cherished.

Love me patiently. Pray with me boldly. Lead with humility.
And when the music fades and the world feels heavy — reach for my hand, and stay.

Because when I love, I love forever.
And I’ve been saving something sacred for you.

No pre-shave routine today. Just warmed up my face with warm water using spray bottle and scooped out 3-4 spoons of Pearl CoffeeOp to my stainless steel bowl.

I got a very satisfactory shave, and had no plans for go for another pass. But seeing too much left over lather I went for another pass, xtg on cheeks and wtg on neck.

Frank Hilson bought the used supercar five years ago for £112,000, but it was later revealed by his girlfriend that he had purchased it via car finance, paying £2,300 a month for 60 months (paying more than £26,000 in fees and interest over the 60-month term).

Duck World recently opened 6 extra fast food restaurants, including one in San Diego, California and another in Hounslow, England.

The startup specialises in offering ""premium speciality duck and pork burgers"" to customers and as of October 2025, the London-founded fast food chain is now worth an estimated  £38.6m, based on the most conservative valuation estimate, but it is currently said to be ""running at a loss"" with a negative EBITDA figure. This has not, however, stopped Duck World from continuing to expand into Australia and the USA. Last year, it also continued its expansion in Britain, opening a restaurant in Manchester and another in Liverpool.

News that Hilson bought his used 2012 Ferrari on finance may come as a surprise to some, given that it was thought Hilson, who has been in business for over two decades since he dropped out of his Computer Science degree course aged 19, was ""rolling in it"".

Meanwhile, Duck World continues with its lawsuit against New South Wales Police after they used its Sydney restaurant as ""a temporary base of operations"" whilst dealing with a hostage situation unfolding at a nearby coffee shop. Duck World said the manager of the Sydney restaurant ""refused to give permission to police to temporarily use the restaurant"", but was ""forced to"".

I write endlessly. Words are how I breathe. If you don’t like to read, you soon will, because I’ll write short stories just for you. Notes tucked into pockets, on mirrors, around your coffee cup. I’ll remind you what love sounds like when spoken softly.

# Cold Open

https://preview.redd.it/38mqel9ojrzf1.jpg?width=1462&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a66f7281d85ae8291bab73dcc9515cf9dc1ef056

While I inch along in my analyses of *Elizabeth Taylor* and *Eldest Daughter*, here's another one from *Anthology*. I’ve been working on a *The Manuscript* interpretation since my It Was All A Dream series. *Midnights* gives away the broad strokes, including the ending, to the narrative plot three years in advance, but it’s up to us to see it. This post delves into the *Mastermind* scheme and explores connections between *Midnights* and *The Life of a Showgirl*.

The Showgirl first emerged in the *Anti-Hero* music video, alongside Real Taylor and Giant Taylor. Real Taylor is the private self, Giant Taylor is the towering myth, and the Showgirl is the manipulative public-facing performance. The moment she joyfully throws Real Taylor off the bed, the metaphor is clear: authenticity and joy are sacrificed to maintain the brand. 

By *Bejeweled*, the Showgirl has evolved. She polishes her image with Dita Von Teese and kills the competition in the talent show. The narrative mirrors a real-world fairytale: the prince proposes, the princess grins, the cameras flash, and then, with absolute control, she ghosts him and keeps the castle. The Showgirl becomes the woman who understands that empowerment, when commodified, is still a costume.

We see her again in *Vigilante Shit* during the Eras Tour. Taylor’s sexually-charged chair dance fuses vengeance with seduction. The Showgirl is a sequined sleeper cell spy.  *The Life of a Showgirl* is both victory lap and Trojan horse, reclaiming her masters while using hyperfemininity, sexual power, and romance to mask deeper subversion. 

Even in *Midnight Rain*, when she writes, *My boy was a montage, slow motion love potion, jumping off things in the ocean*, she shows us her hand. The *boy* was never real; he was written, edited, storyboarded; a muse made of montage.

# Title Sequence

*The Manuscript* opens like a feature film: intimate, ironic, and curiously self-aware. Like *The Fate of Ophelia* video, Taylor is panning backward, revealing that the story of her life has been a set. The song moves like a screenplay: direction notes disguised as dialogue, a romance that is more rehearsal than confession. 

In this film, Taylor is not the ingénue but the narrator, musing over her own myth through glass. She speaks in the third person, detached but deliberate, treating her public narrative as something ghostwritten and perfected by experience.

This song isn’t a love story, it’s a well-lit stage. The beauty of *The Manuscript* lies in its self-awareness. Taylor illuminates the deception, reframing the entire spectacle as a social experiment.

She’s the Wizard of Oz peeling back the curtain: not asking for permission, but not expecting forgiveness either. 

# Feature Presentation

https://preview.redd.it/xo6e2x2qjrzf1.jpg?width=1394&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6ef1f4a62cc88fa3119d8368923c911a22f7856

>**Now and then she rereads the manuscript / of the entire torrid affair / They compared their licenses / he said, ""I'm not a donor but I'd give you my heart if you needed it"" / she rolled her eyes and said, ""You're a professional"" / he said, ""No, just a good samaritan"" /**

The *Manuscript* (aka *The Man-U-Script)*, is the story built around a man, written from the vantage of someone no longer living the story. Taylor is The Narrator, detached from her own public narrative, treating it like a screenplay she’s drafted. The female lead is the Showgirl (her public persona), playing out the romance written for her.

The *torrid affair* is a Taylor-ed whirlwind romance. *They compared their licenses* is two actors comparing character notes before the scene begins. The lines are stilted, rehearsed: *I’d give you my heart if you needed it.* Taylor has carefully crafted a sappy, relatable male lead, and this reads like a placeholder written to sound spontaneous. She rolls her eyes because she’s intentionally stacked the bad dialogue, transforming it into a campy and hyperbolic portrait of the heterosexual chemistry that only breathes *in movies*. 

>**He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was / soon they'd be pushin' strollers / but soon it was over**

This is the grand illusion of domestic bliss. The *sex* and *strollers* are her last great act in the heteronormative fairytale she’s woven for two decades. Marriage, motherhood, and happily ever, served with astonishing irony. Travis, symbolizing the exception to every man before, is both character and metaphor: the explosive climax of the myth she’s dismantling.

*But soon it was over* isn’t about heartbreak, but inevitability. She’s given her audience everything they craved: the spectacle, the Tradwife narrative, the picture-perfect proposal, and perhaps a public wedding on par with royalty. 

The final beard becomes the final act—a mirror held up to the fandom’s hunger, ending not in bliss but in shock and horror. Where Joe Alwyn was reclusive and private, Travis is audaciously visible and outspoken. He exists to challenge everything Swifties believe about Taylor’s romantic life. It’s the curtain call of the Showgirl, a dramatic play before anarchy. Then, with surgical precision, she burns the house down. The public narrative was theater, and she was its proud director.

>**In the age of him, she wished she was thirty / And made coffee every morning in a French press / Afterwards she only ate kids' cereal / And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed /** 

The *him* is not a man but the male-dominated industry itself. The blender that discovered her at fifteen and suggested she play woman when she was still a girl. *She wished she was thirty* captures that early ache for legitimacy, the pressure to be older, wiser, already worthy of the adult world. 

*Making coffee in a French press* becomes mimicry, the illusion of stability and sophistication, the gestures of someone trying to age into safety. *In the age of him*, Taylor’s image was filtered through men who decided what her maturity should look like, sound like, and which *parts* of her would sell.

Then comes the regression. *Afterwards she only ate kids’ cereal / and couldn’t sleep unless it was in her mother’s bed* signals the crash that follows initiation into the industry. Once confronted with its predatory underbelly (its exploitation, isolation, and constant consumption of youth), she retreats back into girlhood. 

The imagery of *cereal* and *her mother’s bed* transforms innocence from what was lost into what must be reclaimed. The girl who wanted to grow up mourns the cost of having done so too quickly, haunted by the knowledge that the world aged her before she had a chance to be young.

>**Then she dated boys who were her own age / With dart boards on the backs of their doors / She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years / Everything had been above board /She wasn't sure**

The *boys her own age* evoke the *Speak Now* and *Red* eras, when Taylor began publicly dating male celebrities like Jake Gyllenhaal and Harry Styles, relationships that became the blueprint of her public narrative. After years of industry men scripting her image, these *boys* represented a new performance: partnerships that appeared equal, safe, and age-appropriate. 

The *dart boards on their doors* reveal the immaturity beneath the illusion, symbols of youthfulness and affluency. These weren’t relationships of emotional reciprocity but props in the larger game of optics and expectation. Each pairing reassured the public of her normalcy while deepening the narrative that her art was born from straight heartbreak.

Yet, beneath that polished surface, something sinister lingers. He said since she was so wise beyond her years, everything had been above board cuts like a defense mechanism she’s heard before. The industry’s refrain of justification. It’s the echo of every man who exploited her brilliance to excuse his control. 

When *she* *wasn’t* *sure*, it marks the fracture: a young woman beginning to doubt the moral architecture she’s been living inside. What was presented as romance was power imbalance repackaged as maturity, desire weaponized as proof of artistic depth. The verse captures that dawning realization, the moment the girl who once believed in love songs begins to recognize the machinery that wrote them.

>**And the years passed / Like scenes of a show / The Professor said to write what you know / Lookin' backwards / Might be the only way to move forward**

*The years passed like scenes of a show* reframes Taylor’s public life as a fully scripted production. Every album cycle, relationship, and reinvention are aspects of  the performance she directs and endures. Time itself becomes theater, not a lived experience, but a carefully edited broadcast. Taylor collapses the distinction between memory and media, explaining that her public existence is orchestrated, packaged, and consumed like a hit show.

*The Professor said to write what you know* introduces the epiphany of clarity. Whether an imagined archetype or a therapist, The Professor becomes the voice of consciousness, urging her to explore her myth for truth. *Looking backwards might be the only way to move forward*. To move forward, she must confront the past not as nostalgia but as cold truth. Revisiting the manuscript that defined her and using it to expose the illusion itself. The performance becomes the portal; revelation, the only honest option left.

>**Then the actors / Were hitting their marks / And the slow dance / Was alight with the sparks / And the tears fell / In synchronicity with the score / And at last / She knew what the agony had been for**

This is the curtain beginning to flutter open. The moment when the machinery of illusion is visible, and Taylor, the director, finally understands the purpose of her pain. *The actors were hitting their marks* is the acknowledgment that everyone in the narrative, including her, has been performing on cue. Every lover, every headline, every viral shot from the stands is choreography. 

*The slow dance alight with sparks* evokes the visual perfection of her current engagement. The polished fairytale of the perfect couple sold to the world. It’s the climax of the *Mastermind* plot, the dominoes she spent years lining up, now falling exactly as intended.

*The tears fell in synchronicity with the score* suggests the moment of catharsis, both cinematic and scripted. Even emotion is synchronized, the soundtrack built to cue the audience’s empathy. The pain wasn’t meaningless, it was the rough pledge she made to the industry’s fraternity. 

By orchestrating her final performance, she transmogrifies the industry’s manipulation into art, the romance into rebellion. This ultimate relationship of hyperbolic portrait poses isn't a love story; it’s an elegantly controlled burn. She’s reverse engineered the spectacle that created the illusion to inevitably dismantle itself.

>**The only thing that's left is the manuscript / One last souvenir from my trip to your shores / Now and then I reread the manuscript / But the story isn't mine anymore**

The manuscript, once a living myth, a script she inhabited and directed, is now inert. The *souvenir from my trip to your shores* acknowledges that the Showgirl’s story was never truly hers; it belonged to the audience, the machine, and the collective hunger that demanded she keep shining. *Shores* evoke the public world (the bright, crowded coastline of fame), where she docked for years, waving to the crowd while her private self receded farther and farther out.

*But the story isn’t mine anymore* is the quietest and sharpest truth of all. The narrative she built to survive (the myth of the heterosexual muse, the tragedy, the triumphant comeback) has been absorbed by culture, owned by everyone but her. This is the end of the Showgirl, the moment she stops pretending authorship over what was always collective fiction. What remains is not the performance, but the awareness.

*The Manuscript* doesn’t end in confession. Like the Lover House between Lover and Fearless, the narrative collapses inward. What began as myth concludes as meta-commentary. The Showgirl, once the mask of performance, becomes the tool through which Taylor dismantles the very illusion that made her. The song’s power lies in its refusal to deliver closure. She doesn’t ask the audience to forgive her for the deception, she invites them to witness it, to see the seams of the story and the woman who wrote it.

By turning the bearding relationship into art, she achieves what few artists ever do. She weaponizes her artifice. The romance, the proposal, the perfectly staged normalcy become mirrors held up to the audience. Travis Kelce isn’t a muse. He's a karmic metaphor, the final mask in a hall of mirrors designed to expose the audience’s complicity. When she burns the set down, she’s not asking for sympathy; she’s asserting control. 

The story no longer belongs to the public because she’s told it herself, stripped of subtext, softened of spectacle. After twenty years of playing the role, she closes the script not with apology but with liberation. The Showgirl bows, the curtain falls, and Real Taylor steps into the daylight beyond applause.",9,1762490208.0,GaylorSwift,2,1.0,False

Since I started the meds in August, I've noticed I haven't even craved an energy drink. The running joke with my friends is I'm a true blue caffeine addict. They weren't really wrong either. Working overnights and going to college made me more reliant on both coffee and energy drinks than I wanted to be. Addiction runs in the family and I'm already recovering from one serious addiction. Caffeine addiction was not something I wanted to live with too. But I was and thats ok.

My days off were spent on and off napping, even with coffee or an energy drink. Now, not only do I sleep through the day, but I dont rely on caffeine or cat naps just to get through my nights. I still like the flavor of coffee but I don't need energy drinks like I did before. Before today, I hadn't had an energy drink in 3 weeks (there were extenuating circumstances for today I promise) and I hadn't missed them at all! It feels really good to just be able to function at a basic level without being reliant on something I've only tolerated for the temporary energy boost. 

It's a great win for me and it made me tear up a little today when I realized all of this so I wanted to share. It feels like I'm starting to make choices based on enjoying my life, instead of just survivng.",4,1762490063.0,antidietglp1,3,1.0,False

You ever get stuck scrolling…and scrolling…and scrolling…through all the bad news? Yeah, me too. But what if I told you I found a way to turn that wasted time into actual cash?

This week, my AI-assisted content creation actually *made* me $300. Three. Hundred. Bucks! Just from putting stuff online. I know, sounds crazy, right?

So, how did I ditch the doom and grab the dollar? Here's the gist:

*   **I finally embraced AI (seriously).** I used to think it was all hype, but tools are getting *really* good. And they’re getting cheaper. I’m talking content generation, image creation, idea brainstorming…the works. It's like having a super-smart intern, but one that doesn't complain about coffee runs.

*   **Found a niche (or three).** I experimented a lot! Turns out, some niches are way more profitable than others. Think about what you're actually good at or interested in – even something kinda niche can be gold.

*   **I got consistent (the hardest part).** This wasn’t a one-hit-wonder. It’s about regular content. Even if it's just a few times a week. (Pro tip: schedule it so you don't have to think about it all the time).

*   **Leveraged what I already knew!** Okay, so I already knew a little about SEO (thanks, ACA!). Put that knowledge to work! It really makes a difference in whether people actually *find* your stuff.

And that's it! It wasn’t magic. It was just putting in the work consistently and leveraging the tools we have available. I'm not saying you'll be rolling in dough overnight, but seriously, $300 this week is a LOT better than zero, right?

Speaking of leveraging tools and finding profitable niches, remember how we're always talking about finding new income streams? **Ready to start earning $1,000+ per month with automated reselling?

I was stuck for the longest time because every guide talked about 'bloom extraction' and 'degassing'. It sounded like a science lab.

I realized it's actually the simplest step. In my article, I explain it with zero jargon. I cover:

- What's actually happening when the coffee puffs up (it's not complicated).

- The one reason skipping this step makes your coffee taste sour.

- The 30-second trick to get it right every single time.

I wrote this for anyone who's ever felt confused by the technical terms. If that's you, I think it'll help:

About me:

\- I enjoy challenging my awareness believing anything is possible. All about self expansion, awareness, and enjoying what you desire experiencing in life. Although I don't like using the label, for lack of a better term am spiritual. Have done reiki healing for friends more than once.

\- I am a goofball that finds stupid things hilarious then can switch up talking about the most real things. I enjoy both light-hearted and deep, reflective, introspective conversations about the soul, philosophy, experiential knowledge, and spirituality.

\- Love Cyberpunk 2077, the Matrix, Bladerunner 2049, John Wick, and particularly enjoy watching 90's and early 2000 films. 

\- Hobbies: I do voice impressions for fun (best impressions are Judy, Female V, Ada Wong, A2, and recently Shrieker's AI from Secret Level's Armored Core). Virtual photography, customizing characters in games and creating lore for them, meditating, visualizing, figure collecting, reading (dark romance), music.

\- A recluse and hermit. I enjoy my solitude and hanging out by myself when I do go out. I do enjoy traveling when I can.

\- Love coffee, sweets, fashion, luxury, scented candles, incense, and wonderful things that are pleasant to the senses.

\- I wear black all the time (even if I'm a girly girl at heart).

\- Introverted, but I open up overtime. I'm selective about the people I talk to, as I have a few but wonderful online friends that feel like family to me. In regards to people, I generally prefer authenticity, maturity, cognizance, open mindedness being accepting of experiences I've had, kind, reflective, emotionally aware, stable, loyal, honest, and are growth oriented.

Open to ANY possible explanation of causation (인과관계).,"My father died after a fall inside a hospital room in South Korea.
We are not blaming anyone — we’re open to ANY possible explanation (blood loss, hypotension, syncope, weakness, confusion, etc.). We just need to understand what led to his death (인과관계).

⸻

Patient previous condition (before hospitalization)
	•	History of two strokes, but no major disability
	•	On antiplatelet medication (blood thinner)
	•	Walking, talking, mentally clear
	•	Came to ER for vomiting black blood (coffee-ground hematemesis) and black diarrhea (melena)

He was alert and responding normally before the fall.

⸻

Key facts (from medical records + timestamped photo)
	•	Around 12:30 AM, transferred from ER to a regular hospital room.
	•	No fall-prevention education, no paperwork to sign.
	•	Bed left with left side against the wall, IV in left hand.

2:00 AM nursing chart (recorded):

“Patient sleeping. Caregiver sleeping. Side rails up. Safety check performed.”

We cannot confirm if a check was done because caregiver was asleep.
But we can confirm the rail discrepancy.

⸻

3:40 AM (timestamped photo – moment discovered)
	•	My father was found on the floor.
	•	Head positioned 180° from pillow direction (near foot end of bed)
	•	Neck straight, face upward toward ceiling
	•	IV in left hand (the left side was against the wall, so he could only fall to the right)
	•	Large amount of blood on the right side of bed → dripped down right side rail → pooled on the floor.
	•	Right bed rail was DOWN, despite chart saying rails were up.
      •     He was wearing a hospital slipper on one foot. 

➡️ Nurses immediately began cleaning the blood, wiping the floor and bed frame.

⸻

Medical timeline
	•	3:40 AM — Found on floor
	•	~4:30 AM — Doctor assessed; said:
“Surgery not immediately necessary.”
CT planned in 6 hours
	•	~5:00 AM — plan changed → urgent CT
	•	CT showed large right epidural hematoma
	•	7:30 AM Emergency craniotomy
	•	After surgery:
“Call your relatives. He will die in 1–2 days.”

Hospital told us:

“This is external trauma (fall-related), not disease. Autopsy required by law.”

Autopsy completed.

⸻

7:08 AM (photo timestamped)
	•	Nurse came with a tablet asking us to sign fall-prevention education documents
	•	Claimed: “We already educated you earlier.”
	•	The education was not provided earlier
	•	Mother refused to sign

We have photo proof showing the timestamp is after the fall, not before.

⸻

Our core question (인과관계)

We are trying to understand causation:

What actually led to my father’s death?

We are open to ALL possibilities:
	1.	Did blood loss from IV cause shock → loss of consciousness → fall?
	2.	Did he try to get up or call for help (due to pain, nausea, blood loss) → fall?
	3.	Or did the fall itself cause the fatal brain injury?

We want a medically realistic explanation of what sequence of events makes sense.

We are not attacking anyone.
We just want to understand how my father went from being alert → to a fall → to death.

Thank you.

1oqkxnq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqkxnq,Today was a good day. And a Base update,"I pretty much finished looting all of Rosewood. I usually make several rounds where I loot the important stuff, then then less important stuff, then the last of the stuff. Today I collected a lot of bleach (good for cleaning), tins of sardines and corned beef (good for cooking), and any other odds and ends like boxes of nails and paperclips.

A bunch of my veggie crops came up seed-bearing today. I harvested lots of tomatoes, potatoes, and cabbage (good for trapping). I stored the new seeds in a container on the roof near the plants. Then I replanted tomatoes, and started some carrots and radish. The new produce went into one of my popsicle freezers. (edit to add: while I don't actually need any new produce (my freezers are full of food), it's a good idea to do it anyway, even if the produce just goes in the compost, to get that juicy farming XP. Higher levels of farming are so helpful).

Kitchen stores coming along nicely. I'm really impressed with my dry goods. I have 30 or so bags of rice and beans, pasta, etc. Lots of sugar, flour, coffee, you name it. Tons of condiments like ketchup, marinara, tomato paste, salt, pepper, soy sauce, oil, butter, lard, etc.

The woodstove is stocked with logs and branches and ready for cold weather, but it's still pretty warm yet. I collected some warm clothing on my journey today as well, some scarves and such. I put them in the lockers.

So now I'm just chilling, watching an episode of Star Trek: TNG while playing some NBA Jam, sipping some wine, eating some chips. I've got some blueberry pie defrosting in my lap. And also Raspberry Shortbread I'm excited to try a little later (see my name).

Edit: I also picked up a bunch of hair colouring. I was green for a while, and today I'm trying Strawberry Blonde. I have white too, really curious how that will look.",9,1762489604.0,projectzomboid,3,1.0,False

The place was practically empty—like, you could hear a pin drop—but the staff took forever just to even acknowledge us. And when they finally did? Rude doesn’t even begin to cover it. I’ve never seen such dismissiveness and arrogance in a place that was once the epitome of South Indian hospitality. It’s like the management has completely checked out.

Now let’s talk about the food. The filter coffee—once the pride of the place—was a complete joke. Flat, watered down, and lacking the aroma and rich flavor Saravana Bhavan was famous for. It felt like they didn’t even care anymore.

What’s worse? Just a short walk away, Aachi’s Namma Kitchen , Manoj Bhavan and sree gupta bhavan are thriving with better service, better food, and actual respect for customers. It’s a harsh reminder that genuine hospitality is still alive—just not at Saravana Bhavan anymore. Sad to see a legend fall this far. 

No wonder there was no sympathy when one of their restaurant was demolished!

I am developing a fine art coffee table book that celebrates individuals who fall outside traditional beauty standards. The project focuses on authenticity and expression rather than perfection or modeling experience.

The imagery will include tasteful nude work presented through an artistic and human lens. It is a non profit passion project, not intended for commercial sale, and aims to highlight honest, unretouched portraits that tell personal stories.

I am a boudoir and portrait photographer by trade, but this project is very different from my usual work and I want it to feel organic and raw. I am looking for insight on how to reach people who would connect with this vision, those who value self expression and vulnerability rather than polished modeling.

Where might I find communities or spaces where individuals would be open to collaborating on something like this?
