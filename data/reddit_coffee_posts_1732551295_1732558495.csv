I met this male coworker at work last year around this time. I was an intern and he was supposed to train me. We got along really well. After a few months, my internship was over and I went back to uni. 
Of course I developed a crush on this man. 
After my internship ended he, every now and then, asked how my studies are going etc. 
He once even called me at my second internship workplace. 
This all went down from January this year to June. My crush did not subside during that time. How could it when he contacts me every now and then? 

I always wanted more from him but since he never made an actual move besides hugging or complimenting me, I didn‚Äôt do anything too.

A month ago, I could wait any longer because I had this strong urge to just try it. I asked him out for coffee over text. I didn‚Äôt say why just bluntly asked him if he wanted to get coffee sometime. He immediately replied with ""yes, of course, when?‚Äù.. so we met up. 
I really thought that he must‚Äôve noticed that I liked him.  
It‚Äôs been one year since when last saw each other.
We went to a restaurant eventually and had coffee there for 2 hours. It was nice.

He paid for my coffee before we left. 

In the last few sentences we spoke to each other in the restaurant he casually mentioned ""his girlfriend‚Äù(back then he didn‚Äôt have one, so assumed he‚Äôs could be single still). I thought I was not hearing right. My heart shattered (but that‚Äôs a different problem, I‚Äôm not gonna touch on right now). 

I felt sooo weird and stupid.. going out with a taken guy. I subtly flirted with him the whole time. Even though the talk was not really that flirty. It was just casual talking.. it‚Äôs been a while.
But why on earth would he drink coffee with me one on one? And what does he think that meeting was? 

Do guys just not get it?

Throughout our whole conversation, I asked him what he‚Äôs up to? Secretly wanting to know if there‚Äôs someone, and he didn‚Äôt mention her at all, only at the very end casually (e.g. saying something like ‚Äúoh yeah that‚Äôs me gf‚Äôs friend‚Äù)

How do you guys see this?? I would‚Äôve never met up with him in the first place if I‚Äôd known that he was taken. Especially since there was no need for a coffee at all, I just wanted to talk to him, there wasn‚Äôt a specific occasion or anything.",1,1732557878.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False
1gzpcfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gzpcfe/my_26f_boyfriend_27m_is_upset_that_i_wont_change/,My (26F) boyfriend (27M) is upset that I ‚Äúwon‚Äôt change.‚Äù Am I the problem?,"My boyfriend seems to be constantly upset with me and wants me to change. Am I the problem?

My (26F) boyfriend (27F) and I have been together for about a year. It‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ rocky. His life circumstances aren‚Äôt great, and he holds a lot of frustration about his circumstances and with himself. This leads to some conflict between us. 

I feel as though he constantly finds fault in little things I do. Last night I wanted to go to bed early (I always go to bed early, I‚Äôm a teacher and my body is on a schedule of going to bed and waking up early; it‚Äôs tough for me to stay up late). He got really upset. He tends to get upset when I want to go to bed early and claims he feels abandoned because he doesn‚Äôt sleep well and has to stay up alone. I think this is ridiculous. 

This morning when I woke up he asked me what time I wanted to leave to run errands as we had a prior engagement at noon. I told him I wanted to drink a cup of coffee and then we could go. He insisted that he needed an actual time (it was 8 AM at the time). Initially I said 10, which he said was too late. I then said 9 and he seemed satisfied with that, but then he proceeded to get upset with me again and said that I‚Äôm irresponsible with time management and it‚Äôs annoying to him. It turned into a fight between us about how I never listen or change. I pointed out to him that I never am the one getting upset at him for things or asking him to change, but that he always does this to me. He claims that I don‚Äôt ‚Äúhave to‚Äù tell him to change because he ‚Äúalready changes‚Äù without being asked. I disagreed, and I told him that if he really finds this much fault in me, that I am not compatible with him and we should just break up so he can find someone more compatible who he doesn‚Äôt ask to change so much. 

I can go on with countless examples. It always seems like something small to me- I am a little disorganized and I know this about myself as a character flaw, but I don‚Äôt feel that it warrants these reactions. Maybe he‚Äôs just tired of it, but in that case I stand by what I said that he should find someone he is more compatible with since disorganization bothers him so much. He has his flaws too, but I don‚Äôt react this way to his behaviors and get so angry with him- I only really get angry when he gets upset with me first. I‚Äôm genuinely thinking of ending the relationship as I don‚Äôt see this improving. I‚Äôm doing my best, but I will always have my flaws I struggle with. I don‚Äôt know- am I the problem? 

TL;DR: My boyfriend often criticizes me for my flaws and seems upset that I will not put effort into changing. I feel some of his issues are small, or fundamental incompatibilities. However, I am not sure if I‚Äôm the problem and he is being reasonable. ",1,1732557857.0,relationships,1,1.0,False
1gzpcee,https://i.redd.it/6sialay0833e1.jpeg,I've seen the light.,"After lurking around this sub for a few weeks, I finally decided to give Morrowind a real shot. I hadn't played since I was in fourth grade and I'm 30 now.

At first, I made a Redguard and did a custom warrior build that I saw from CoffeeNutGaming on YouTube. I was having a lot of fun playing and learning about the world, but I felt *too* optimized and wasn't getting much of a challenge.

I was in a bit of a lul after completing the first of the Imperial Legion quests in Gnisis and made who you see now, a Nord Barbarian, just the preset class, and went with the Atronach Stone.

Next thing I know, I've surpassed my level 18 Redguard and have actually explored a healthy chunk of the world instead of just taking Silt Striders and ships everywhere. It feels like I get what the game is all about now.

The combat is equal parts challenging and flavorful, as a barbarian using what armor and weapons I come across and shaking off most spells that come my way through that fierce barbarian spirit. I feel *immersed* in an RPG for the first time in a long time.

Coming from Skyrim and Oblivion, I've gotta say, Morrowind is absolutely amazing. I know I've only just scratched the surface of this game and I can't wait to take this Nord on one hell of an adventure.

Also, the orcs clearing their throats makes me laugh out loud every time.",1,1732557855.0,Morrowind,0,1.0,False
1gzpc7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1gzpc7p/which_coffee_machine_makes_the_hottest_coffee/,Which Coffee Machine Makes The Hottest Coffee?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on a mission lately to find the perfect coffee maker that delivers piping hot coffee consistently. After testing numerous machines and spending way too much money (my wife wasn't too happy about that), I think I've finally cracked the code.

Let me share what I've learned about brewing temperature and why it matters. The ideal brewing temperature for coffee should be between 195¬∞F and 205¬∞F to extract the best flavors. Anything lower and you're missing out on the full potential of those precious beans.

Through my testing, I discovered that many budget coffee makers barely reach 185¬∞F, which explains why some homemade coffee tastes bland. After trying various models, I found that thermal carafe coffee makers generally maintain higher temperatures compared to glass carafe models.

The absolute champion I discovered (which you can find here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine) is a game-changer. It consistently brews at 200¬∞F and keeps the coffee hot without that burnt taste you get from leaving it on a heating plate too long.

Here's what makes a coffee maker brew hotter coffee:
- PID temperature control
- Powerful heating elements
- Pre-heating function
- Quality insulation
- SCAA certification

Some pro tips I've picked up:
1. Always run a cleaning cycle monthly
2. Use filtered water for better heat conductivity
3. Preheat your carafe with hot water
4. Don't let your machine sit idle for too long

If you're serious about getting the hottest possible coffee without compromising taste, I highly recommend checking out this selection of premium coffee makers: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine. Trust me, the difference in temperature and taste is noticeable from the first sip.

Something interesting I learned during my research is that water mineral content actually affects how efficiently your machine heats up. Using filtered water not only keeps your machine cleaner but also helps it reach optimal brewing temperature faster.

I've been using my new machine for three months now, and I haven't had a lukewarm cup since. The morning coffee ritual has become something I actually look forward to instead of just a caffeine necessity.

Remember, while hot coffee is great, anything above 205¬∞F will start to burn the coffee grounds and create bitter flavors. The sweet spot is finding a machine that consistently hits that perfect temperature range.

I hope this helps fellow coffee enthusiasts in their quest for the perfect hot cup of joe. Let me know if you have any questions about specific models or brewing techniques!",1,1732557841.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Black coffee is more than just a morning pick-me-up; it's a powerhouse beverage with numerous health benefits, especially for those looking to maintain or improve their energy levels and support their wellness goals.¬†[Let‚Äôs dive into why black coffee deserves a spot in your daily routine.](https://linktr.ee/balance_burn)

1. Zero Calories, Full Energy

One of the biggest advantages of black coffee is its calorie-free nature. Unlike sugar-laden lattes or flavored coffees, a cup of black coffee contains virtually no calories, making it an ideal choice for those aiming to lose or manage weight. It delivers pure energy without adding to your daily calorie count.

2. Boosts Metabolism and Fat Burning

The caffeine in black coffee is a natural stimulant that can help boost your metabolism. Studies have shown that it increases fat oxidation, making your body more efficient at burning fat during physical activity. Drinking a cup before exercise can enhance your performance and calorie burn.

3. Enhances Focus and Mental Clarity

Black coffee is well-known for improving mental alertness and focus. It stimulates the central nervous system, helping you stay sharp and productive throughout the day. Whether you're tackling a big project or preparing for an intense workout, black coffee can give you the mental edge you need.

4. Rich in Antioxidants

[Black coffee](https://linktr.ee/balance_burn)¬†is a natural source of antioxidants, which help combat free radicals in the body. These antioxidants reduce inflammation and protect cells from damage, contributing to overall health.

5. Supports Weight Management

Black coffee acts as a natural appetite suppressant, helping you control cravings and reduce unnecessary snacking. By curbing your appetite, it supports a healthy calorie deficit, which is essential for weight loss.

6. Promotes Heart Health (In Moderation)

When consumed in moderation, black coffee has been linked to reduced risks of heart disease. Its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to improve blood circulation contribute to better cardiovascular health.

[Tips for Maximizing Black Coffee Benefits](https://linktr.ee/balance_burn)

1. Avoid Sugar and Creamers: Adding sugar, syrups, or cream can negate the calorie-free benefits. Stick to plain black coffee.
2. Choose Quality Beans: O p t for high-quality, freshly ground coffee for a richer flavor and more antioxidants.
3. Limit Intake: Keep your consumption to 2-4 cups per day to avoid side effects like jitters or insomnia.
4. Hydrate: Since coffee is a diuretic, balance it with plenty of water throughout the day.

Conclusion

Black coffee is a versatile and calorie-free beverage that boosts clean energy, supports weight management, and enhances mental focus. By incorporating it into your daily routine, you can enjoy its numerous health benefits while staying on track with your wellness goals.

1gzp2s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gzp2s3/finding_equivalent_clicks_for_adjustment_plate/,Finding Equivalent Clicks for Adjustment Plate Upgrade in [Timemore C3S],"Just got the my adjustment plate upgrade for Timemore C3S, I am trying to find an equivalent clicks for the stock (12 clicks/full rotation) to the upgraded plate (30 clicks/full rotation), so I can start dialing in from my usual grind size.

With some math, I got the scaling factor of **2.5** (by dividing the new range with the old one, 30/12 = 2.5), meaning that my usual grind size of **10 clicks** times 2.5 will be equivalent to **25 clicks** in the upgraded one. By visually comparing the location, the 25 clicks is pretty close to 10 clicks in the stock placte.

However, when compared C3S and C3 ESP using the [Coffee grind size chart](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/coffee-grind-size-chart/), the **1.0** in C3 ESP which equals one full rotation does not match the full rotation of C3S at **12 clicks**, visualized below:

I'm quite confident in the calculation as the visual comparison checked out, this leave me with the question, is the C3S and C3 ESP really the same grinder with different plate? This was my initial understanding but some mention that the [C3 ESP have a tighter screw pit](https://www.reddit.com/r/picopresso/comments/199q44w/comment/l9vnout). Hope that someone who fiddled with the upgraded plate before or own the ESP one can help clarify this for me. Thanks!",1,1732557274.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1gzp0ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gzp0ij/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,I don't know what to do. ,"So for context I am 18F in college and am saving up to move out of my moms place. My mom(43F) and her boyfriend(50M) have been together for a year as of this week. Recently she's been having issues, she got diagnosed with BPD and is going through pre-menopause. Her boyfriend was laid off in August of '23 and hasn't been able to find a job since. He moved in with my mom because he could no longer afford his own place and they were in a place at the time where this seemed suitable. 

Now for more of the present events. My mom has been having the ""episodes"", she loses all rationality and is just screaming at anything and everyone, in the moment she knows she's being irrational but can't control herself. She hasn't become physical with us but throws coffee mugs, broke a trash can lid, put a hole in a door, etc. Me and my mom are close, our relationship has had its ups and downs but as of now it's pretty good. We understand each other like no one else, so in turn, I'm the one who has been diffusing her in these arguments. I don't always step in because I know they have to work it out themselves but in moments where I can give her a hug, talk her down, and even yesterday I had to yell at her because she threw a table it was like scolding a child and sent her to her room where we talked and she calmed down. But to be honest her boyfriend is not helping. I've never really liked him, there's been moments where I did and moments where I was disgusted with him. 

For example, whenever my mom needs to calm down during one of her episodes all she needs is hugs and reassurance (this seems pretty easy, right?), but he sometimes just doesn't give them to her. He thinks he can ""opt out"" of her meltdown and go have his own space. I understand that is a mental load on him as well but if my partner needed to calm down during a fight and just needed a hug and cuddles I would give it to him. (Me and my boyfriend 19M have been together for over two years) And my partner has been able to do that for me so I don't understand why my moms boyfriend isn't able to do it for her. Sometimes it seems as though he antagonizes my mom on purpose, yesterday she was escalating and she just needed a hug and instead he handed her a coffee mug because ""she was gonna break it anyways"". 

I forgot to mention she does have this emergency medication to take whenever she starts to escalate, but there's been times before where he just didn't go get it for her. She was crying and screaming and asked for him to get it and he just didn't  so I had to get it for her. And this has happened multiple times. 

But what I need advice on is what do I even do. Yesterday, someone called the police in our neighborhood, while they didn't come to our house we could seem them through the fence. They did this because my mom ends up trying to talk it out when she thinks she's calmed down so she finds him outside and he sets her off against she ends up screaming for the whole neighborhood to hear. I'm reaching my breaking point. Whenever they have arguments she comes and finds me, which I love that I'm a safe space for her, but it's exhausting. Having to constantly diffuse arguments and do all the work for her boyfriend, and right now I'm in the middle of final prep (all of my classes finals are project based), and it's getting to a point where I don't have the energy or mental load to do my work anymore. I also work a part time job  and I work from 5 pm to 12 pm most nights that I work. 

Right now they're really on the rocks because he just can't give her the support she needs. They've ""made up"" but they've done that in past and is just happened again. This next week my boyfriend's is going out of state to visit family and purchase a car from his step-dad. Then this Friday I fly up after him and help him make the cross country road trip back to our home town. Im worried about my brothers really (13M 20M), the younger one is only in town for the week because he lives with my dad and my older brother is only the spectrum and has a hard time dealing with anything stressful. Maybe im being over dramatic but it's just so stressful, anytime the TV plays to loud or people are laughing in the background I think it's her screaming in an argument and it makes my stomach drop and my palms sweaty but then I realize it's not that but I still feel on edge. I'm going to move out with my partner in the summer but I don't know how to handle this from here.

1gzp01g,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/comments/1gzp01g/first_sit_general_questions/,First sit - general questions ,"I'm housesitting a whole host of critters over Thanksgiving week. I stay here 18-20 hours out of every 24 hour period, sleeping here and only leaving during the day for a few hours to feed my own pets and run errands. 

Some questions I'd really love your feedback on:

1) do the owners ever leave food for the sitter since we'll be here constantly? I snagged a couple of eggs for breakfast and some cottage cheese out of the fridge but feel weird and will replace. But what about coffee or things like that?

2) the house is clean and uncluttered but over 11 days it's going to get pretty dusty and dirty/furry from the animals. Of course I will clean my areas and any dishes and if I can find the washer I'll wash the sheets. But what else am I expected to do? I don't want them to come home from 11 days to a dusty paw-printed house. Should I sweep, mop, and dust before departing? Of note: I have nerve damage and this will take me some time to do. I'd pay a cleaning lady probably $75-100 dollars for the job, and I'm making $75 per day. 

3) they didn't show me where the washing machine, cleaning supplies, or trash bags are. To what extend can I go opening doors and closets looking for these things? Obviously I would set foot in a bedroom but I'm wondering if the main floor and garage have these things. 

4) they have me on an air mattress on the living room floor. Honestly I almost cancelled at the meet & greet because of this, I hadn't expected it. I've just been sleeping on the couch instead because my butt hits the floor when I lay on the mattress. Thoughts? I'm not 22, lol. I'm 47 and have nerve damage. 

5) they are paying me a holiday rate of $75 per day for one dog. I later discovered they have a cat, 3 fish, 2 turtles and 3 chickens. The cat is a lot of work but the others aren't, although it's hard for me to get out in the snow and collect the eggs every day. I agreed to this at the meet & greet because I didn't want to leave them in a bad spot right before their trip, and I'm also trying to build a client base and some positive reviews on the site. Thoughts for how to handle? Not sure how to price for fish lol. 

Thanks all, I know I'm asking a lot of questions but I want to do all of this well and hopefully create a nice side business doing something I love. ",1,1732557092.0,RoverPetSitting,5,1.0,False

They were the first to broach every major subject and undertake every major initiative associated with a blossoming relationship, which gave me the impression that they felt strongly about me. It was very flattering, I felt very blessed, and I reciprocated their interest and then some.

Although, after a few quasi-dates, after they made a point of explicitly asking to date, she clarified that she's ""not ready for a relationship right now"" and is only interested in ""fun, no-pressure dates,"" ostensibly because ""when I am into somebody, I am \*really\* into them,"" the way things moved from that point onward seemed to contradict this statement. They began staying over for nights and days on end, calling me pet names, sending me sentimental texts, talking about going on a trip together, moving in with her and her roommate, etc. She told her parents about me. I would buy her surprise treats after her classes wrapped up in the evening and go on coffee runs in the morning. We became openly affectionate in the workplace, which is something she'd previously been hesitant about. On an informal but still professional video conference with school colleagues, in a working-from-home context, she and I called in together from her laptop, clearly seated together on my bed. It felt like we were quickly moving toward being officially together, and I could not have been more excited and appreciative. When the subject of seeing others came up, she insisted that she was not seeing anyone else, I said the same (and she added ""I didn't think you were."")

Just as things were seemingly warming up, becoming more familiar and tender, we went on a date she professed to be looking forward to, but for the entirety of that evening, she was in bad spirits: unusually combative, sullen, and so on. I am very sensitive and instinctually mirror another's energy, so I withdrew and became a bit dyspeptic myself, I suppose, and asked her directly whether she found me as obnoxious as her behavior that evening suggested - given that it consisted in a relentless picking apart of everything I said and did - and proposed that if that were the case, we simply call it quits in the early stages and seek more compatible partners. We had a discussion, seemingly moved past it, and went to bed together.

The following morning, we were no less affectionate than usual, and decided we were both in the mood to have penetrative intercourse (something we had yet to, on account of my having issues maintaining an erection due to performance anxiety, frankly), and while we were out to buy protection, she abruptly decided she was going to go home, claiming she had a ton of work to do in her classes and it was stressing her out. This excuse plainly contradicted previous statements to the effect that she had finished all of her final papers, so I was suspicious, but I only supposed she was perturbed by the friction of the night before. I sent her some texts throughout the day apologizing, and she replied back the next day reassuring me that her only reason for leaving in haste was school-related stress.

Recently, when involved in amorous activities, I asked whether she's been tested recently or involved with any new partners, as her statements on that front have been many and inconsistent (she claimed at one point to have only ever had one partner, a long-term ex-boyfriend, but also made a passing remark about going on an impulsive sexual spree during a manic episode that transpired not long ago.) She amended her statement to include one guy who went down on her months before we met, and mentioned that she'd gone on a date within the past few weeks, but added ""nothing happened.""

I was quite surprised, and I suppose it must have shown in my change of expression, as she began adding disclaimers and qualifiers, saying it took place when she wasn't sure whether I wanted to date (strange, given all the time and activities we shared, to which I make reference above), that it was the day after our turbulent date, which contributed to her saying yes to an old acquaintance she met at clubs throughout the city who proposed a date via her IG DMs (which is odd, given that we spent that night together - when could she have had that conversation? Did it all materialize in a spur of the moment way the following day, after she mysteriously left? I have a hard time taking that explanation seriously). 

I understand that she was upfront originally about not being ready for a relationship, and at the time was fully on-board, and respected her directness. However, her description of what she wanted seemed to clash, increasingly so, with the reality of what she was seemingly keen to share with me, which was greater verbal, physical, and social intimacy and entwinement. Given the ""progressive"" developments, I assumed that her interest was such that she wasn't going to ""play the field"" in search of extra gratification or alternative possibilities. 

I am feeling quite hurt, not only because this seems to dash my vision of a relationship that was mutually felt to be special and was on its way to becoming exclusive (upon registering my shock and disappointment, she quickly offered exclusivity, but I declined, feeling it wasn't offered out of genuine desire, but to patch things over, as a concession), but because she was rather dishonest when she left my place to hurry off and prepare for her date later that evening. Did she ""owe me"" that information? Maybe not, but I am bothered that a fabricated reason was provided, in lieu of the truth. I fully appreciate that dating around when uncommitted is a salutary thing, that one ought to be deliberate and thorough given the stakes of partnership, but I guess things didn't feel ""casual"" to me anymore, plus I feel like her statements and actions might have been, to some degree, designed to obscure and mislead.  
  
I can anticipate the argument that, in the absence of a verbal contract regarding exclusivity, I ought not have assumed anything, and have no grounds for disgruntlement, but is conduct not supposed to be indicative of anything? How is it that she could be inappropriately inquisitive and harsh concerning my female friends and the exes with whom I remain close, about whom I sought to assure her, and yet think nothing of linking with some other guy? Everyone is entitled to do as they please so long as they aren't violating any agreements, but is it not ethically a tad dubious to wake up in one person's bed, rush off with a kiss, and climb into the bed of another (I speculate, since we were quick to become intimate so it may be customary for her, but even if sex wasn't involved, taken metaphorically) within hours?

It's not as though I didn't have my doubts and hesitations, as I explain, but despite our differences (she likes to party, I'm a homebody, etc.), I felt genuinely cared for by this woman, and was beginning to offer her more of myself. I really liked her, but now I feel as though I was merely infatuated with a mirage, like I can't believe what is communicated by her words or actions.

Endearing characters, impossible obstacles, thought-provoking moral quandaries and an emotional bond that draws you in. These are the things that make a good story. These are the things that make you feel real emotion for a fictional character. These are the things that make you sit back and reflect on a journey you didn't even take. And these things are present in spades in Persona 5 Royal.



I don't like anime styles of storytelling. Not that I haven't seen any good anime - far from it. But when I compare the methods of storytelling used in anime and other Japanese media compared to Western media, I tend to prefer Western media. The literal interpretation of emotional or subconscious elements. The over-explanation and spelling out of a character's thought process, compared to Western's preference to infer and study faces. The long monologues between protagonist and antagonist. The fanservice. The anime grunts. All of that is present in Persona 5 Royal. And at first, I really didn't think I liked it.



I also don't like JRPG's, specifically turn-based combat. I've played two I thought were good (Undertale and Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door), but I've found everything else, even Earthbound and Omori, to be far too boring and tedious. I like strategy and tactics, but I also like having feedback for my actions. There's something very unsatisfying about pressing a button to do an attack and then watching the attack. I'd rather just perform the attack myself. Not to mention the annoying amount of grinding normally required to level up so you can actually progress. Sometimes I'll see a game that looks cool, and then I realize it has turn-based combat, and be sad because I know I won't like it.



Persona 5 Royal proved to me that there is no such thing as bad gameplay - just bad execution. Because I loved the gameplay. I sunk my teeth deep into the turn-based combat. I spent dozens of hours grinding in Mementos to make super powerful personas that could one-shot anything I wanted. I got into the card system to customize them into whatever I wanted, making efficient use of alarms and incense. I loved riding around in my Morgana car slamming into enemies, hearing the satisfying popping sound of a character leveling up, studying movesets carefully to figure out combos between my party.



Here's the catch though: none of that would have been interesting without characters I cared about. If the characters are bland, basic and couldn't make me feel anything deeper than ""dang that's cool,"" then I'm not going to care if the enemy one-shots them. But if I feel emotionally invested in a character because they're trying to accomplish their dreams? ""NOOO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE YOU KILLED RYUJI!?!?!""



Some concepts of storytelling are so fundamental they transcend mediums, so whether it's Japanese or Western media they're still impactful. Atlus perfected the fundamentals. The characters in P5R are some of the most well-realized, human, true, vulnerable, and grounded characters I have ever had the joy to get to know in any video game. Ryuji, Ann, Morgana, Makoto, Futaba, Tae, Kasumi, Haru, Sojiro. These characters have more depth, heart and soul than just about anything I've played in the last ten years. And I know their stories will stick with me for another ten years.



If you're reading this and, like me, you don't like anime or JRPG's. Play it anyway. Give it a chance. Get through the Japanese weirdness so you can meet those characters, hear their stories, learn their dreams. Latch onto the turn-based mechanics, push them to their limits, tinker with movesets and combos. You'll come to see what a special little game this is. 



And above all else: don't rush it. The game is a slow burn, so let it burn. Waltz your way through the calming streets and melancholy melodies of Japanese cityscapes. Ponder over a cup of coffee in a quiet caf√© as a clock ticks soothingly in the background. Watch the hustle and bustle of everyday folk rushing here and there in the underground subways. The game wants to take your hand and lead you on an adventure, so let it. Don't be afraid to take your time.",14,1732556520.0,patientgamers,18,0.85,False

We don't ""guess"" if a product will sell. 

1. We find a product that already sells
2. We Improve the product by 10%
3. We sell it under our own brand 

We've used the same formula to launch 9 different products that are all profitable.

# Step 1 - Find Winning Products

[JungleScout](https://preview.redd.it/jjiwb3dfxv2e1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2504f695095ec777f731180af81d41870a74bcd8)

I use JungleScout to find products with: 

* ‚Üí 600+ monthly sales 
* ‚Üí 1000+ monthly searches 
* ‚Üí Under 2000 reviews 

This shows me products already selling on Amazon but with low competition.

# Step 2 - Create a Variation

[Amazon Review](https://preview.redd.it/tyxwvreixv2e1.jpg?width=920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae1ecae6804a01ceccd3d63bd6616d0bb9baaa34)

Next I find the product on Amazon. 

* ‚Üí I find the current top sellers 
* ‚Üí I look at their ""1-star"" reviews 

I look for the number 1 main issue that customers have with the product.

# Step 3- Design your own brand

[Design Your Own Brand](https://preview.redd.it/mu3x6eyoxv2e1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=257c04730d5823e17ddff1dce6de0d4eb8b48a7e)

For your name & logo, use namelix.

Then go to midjourney and use AI to create some high-quality mockups. 

Save these for your manufacturer and they will create custom packaging.

# Step 4 - Find a manufacturer

[Alibaba](https://preview.redd.it/kkbllr4txv2e1.jpg?width=2410&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b9a1998f2af97dea436d2c670f6f7e4b92ef081)

For this, I use Alibaba 

* ‚Üí Search for your product 
* ‚Üí Sort by ""verified sellers"" 
* ‚Üí Send them the changes you want 
* ‚Üí Order a sample product 

If the sample comes out how you want it, then order 100 units to Amazon.

# Step 5 - Boost your Listing

[Helium 10](https://preview.redd.it/h1ywqf8wxv2e1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fa139c059d35f1d864154c911c1ef9950b08dd3)

You can do this with Amazon ads: 

* ‚Üí Find your product on [https://Helium10.com](https://honeysyed.com/helium10) 
* ‚Üí Look at the top 10 keywords 
* ‚Üí Target these with your ads 

This is how we get our listings at the top of the search and start to drive sales.

This is all it takes to launch on Amazon! 

1. Find a winning product
2. Find a supplier who makes it
3. Improve the product by 10%
4. Add your own unique branding
5. Boost it with Amazon ads

One product changed our lives! 

Put in the work and you can do the same.

1gzon9t,https://i.redd.it/l0hrsvwa333e1.jpeg,"Lenovo Duet 3 (Gen 9, 2024) Review and Comparison ","I've just finished a day of heavy browser-based work at the office on the Duet 11 with a 4K external monitor. The results were good. I can't say that I had any productivity drop compared to the Core i5 Chromebook I usually use but I know it wasn't quite keeping up with me. I'm usually busy with 20-30 tabs and some Sheet and SaaS interface work and it did exceptionally well.

This is day three testing my Duet and I'm writing a [full review here](https://www.umpcportal.com/2024/11/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-2025-mediatek-kompanio-835-review/).

Here's an extract of the review which will include everything I've learnt and tested.

Differences between the Duet 3 11 (2022) and Duet 3 Gen 9 (2024):

Original cost ‚Ç¨399. Discounts already seen for ‚Ç¨299. (Germany, 8GB model.)
The screen has a different, warmer colour temperature and can be reduced down to much lower brightness. I feel that the max brightness is a little less than the older model.
The touchpad has a much better click feedback.
The speakers are much louder.
The Gen 9 is more responsive and starts up more quickly, by about 2 seconds.
The rear camera is a huge module and seems quite exposed through the case cutout.
The plastic case is certainly not as stylish. I don‚Äôt believe that the portrait mode has much value when you can‚Äôt use the keyboard in that orientation. (It could have been an interesting writing mode.) It might have value in docked desktop mode and coffee browsing mode.
Battery life is lower. Initial tests indicate about 10% more power is needed for tasks. (Idle, streaming and video playback tests completed.)
The 45W charger is a large, two-piece adaptor with a thick three-pole mains plug. I don‚Äôt like it.
Physical privacy shutter on the front camera.
USB port positioning has changed. One has been moved to the top (side in portrait mode).
Simple, no-marketing brown box which is similar to bulk or educational packaging I‚Äôve seen in the past.
Keyboard are not interchangeable between the Gen 9 and th previous model. (Only three pogo pins on the new model.)
3.5mm headset port included (no USB C DAC included)
No pen included in this DE model.
No ‚ÄúHelp me write‚Äù option (a Chromebook Plus feature) despite the built-in NPU
Tablet weight is 14gm less than the old model.

I also tested it with Google Meet today and the webcam, mic and speakers are pretty good for that scenario. Software backgrounds worked well too.

If you have questions, I'm happy to answer or test and put the results into my reference article.

In summary, this new Duet is enough to keep me going for a few years as an ultra-mobile, secure travelling companion. It could have had more (battery life and processing power) but it's enough to make it a great value product.

Half a year ago I joined a hobby group where I met 26F and rather quickly we became good hobby friends. As the hobby group came to an end her and I began to talk behind the scenes about how badly things ended in the hobby group. One thing leading to another where her and I caught up for coffee where she admitted to having feelings for me. I was rather caught off guard as she does have a partner but they are in a poly relationship which I am none the wiser about. Few weeks go by and she agrees to see a show with me and after we have a talk about us. For context I swore off dating for the year due to circumstances. At the end of the night however she says that upon thinking more about things she doesn't actually have feelings for me which leaves me frustrated due to the back and forth on this decision but ultimately we go past it.

Several IRL interactions and meet ups are fine but always seem either distant or cold. Eventually for me stepping back, leaving messages on read or very brief responses (Not the best way to handle things I know.)

That half a year now is where we are. I joined a new hobby group with all new people with different online usernames. Hobby night arrives however and she is there. In fact she went out of her way to make sure she made a fake name in case I would see her and make a reason not to join the group. Four weeks go by to where we land here today.

Driving her home she says how she wants to be a close friend of mine but she would never date me (in fact going as far to almost insult me at the notion of ever dating). Yet wants to be close and in my life. Then a few minutes later being fully fine if we aren't friends and hopes we can be friends in the future if I would ever allow it as I said I might be leaving the hobby group.

I don't understand these weird behaviors and back and forth on feelings and not sure really on how to proceed or even if I should proceed?

1gzoh6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gzoh6p/the_cabin_that_waits/,The cabin that waits ,"I thought it was a great deal at first.
I‚Äôd been scrolling through rental listings for a quiet getaway when I found it: a cabin deep in the woods, miles away from anyone else. It was advertised as ‚Äúa rustic retreat for writers and dreamers.‚Äù The photos showed a small, weathered structure with a cozy interior‚Äînothing fancy, but charming in its simplicity.

The price was ridiculously low, almost suspiciously so, but the reviews were glowing. People talked about how peaceful it was, how the isolation helped them ‚Äúfind themselves,‚Äù and how they couldn‚Äôt wait to come back. It sounded perfect.

The drive was long and the directions vague, but I eventually found the gravel path that led to the cabin. When I arrived, the first thing I noticed was that it didn‚Äôt look quite like the pictures. It was the same cabin, sure, but the boards were darker, more warped, and the windows looked like they hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in years.

There was also a note nailed to the door.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt open until you‚Äôre ready to take their place.‚Äù

I laughed nervously. It had to be some kind of quirky guestbook thing, right? A rustic touch for an isolated retreat. The padlock on the door matched the instructions I‚Äôd been emailed, so I unlocked it, stepped inside, and tried to settle in.

The first night was uneventful, mostly. The cabin was quiet‚Äîtoo quiet. I‚Äôd expected to hear crickets, maybe the distant hoot of an owl, but there was nothing. Just the faint creak of the wooden beams and the occasional gust of wind.

It was peaceful, though. That‚Äôs what I told myself as I made some tea, curled up in the rickety armchair, and started reading.

The second night, things started to feel‚Ä¶ off.

It was little things at first. My notebook, which I‚Äôd left on the coffee table, was on the counter instead. The front door was unlocked when I swore I‚Äôd bolted it. And then, while I was brushing my teeth, I thought I heard something‚Äîa faint knocking sound.

It stopped as soon as I opened the bathroom door.

By the third night, I couldn‚Äôt ignore it anymore.

The knocking was louder now, deliberate and insistent. It didn‚Äôt come from the front door or the windows but seemed to echo from within the walls. I tried to ignore it, pulling the blankets over my head, but then it came again‚Äîthree slow, deliberate knocks.

I shouted, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù but the only response was silence.

The next morning, I decided I‚Äôd had enough. I packed my things and went to leave, but when I opened the door, there was another note nailed to it:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not ready yet.‚Äù

The gravel path I‚Äôd driven up was gone. In its place was an overgrown trail that led deeper into the woods.

I slammed the door shut and tried calling for help, but of course, there was no signal. I even tried the old landline phone mounted on the wall, but the line was dead.

I was trapped.

The days blurred together after that. I stopped keeping track of time, mostly because it felt like time had stopped altogether. The knocking grew more frequent, sometimes even during the day, and I started finding more notes.

‚ÄúStay longer. You‚Äôre almost ready.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre waiting for you.‚Äù

One night, I woke up to the sound of footsteps in the cabin. They were slow, deliberate, pacing back and forth in the living room. My bedroom door was locked, but the handle jiggled as if someone was testing it.

I whispered, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù but there was no reply. Just a low, guttural sound that sent chills down my spine.

When I finally mustered the courage to open the door, the living room was empty. But there was another note on the coffee table:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll take their place soon.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what they mean by ‚Äútheir place,‚Äù but I‚Äôm too scared to find out. The cabin feels alive now, like it‚Äôs watching me, waiting for me to make some kind of decision. Every time I try to leave, I end up back here, like the woods are circling in on themselves.

The knocking didn‚Äôt stop. It came at all hours now‚Äîmornings, afternoons, nights. Always three deliberate knocks, always from a different part of the cabin. The walls, the ceiling, even the floor. I searched for loose boards or animals, anything that could explain the noise, but the more I looked, the more absurd it felt.

Because the knocks weren‚Äôt random.

They came whenever I thought about leaving.

I tested the theory the next morning, standing at the front door with my packed bag. The second my hand touched the doorknob‚Äî

Knock. Knock. Knock.

It came from right behind me, from inside the kitchen. My stomach dropped. I‚Äôd been standing in the kitchen just seconds ago, and there had been no one there.

I turned, shaking, but the room was empty. My eyes landed on the coffee table.

Another note.

‚ÄúLeaving isn‚Äôt part of the deal.‚Äù

What deal? I hadn‚Äôt agreed to anything. I tried shouting into the empty room. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you want! Just let me go!‚Äù

The cabin didn‚Äôt answer, but the knocking stopped.

For a moment, I thought it was over. The silence felt so complete it was almost comforting. I let myself believe that maybe I‚Äôd passed some kind of test. Maybe I was free to go now.

And then I heard footsteps‚Äîsoft and deliberate, like someone walking barefoot on the wooden floorboards.

But they weren‚Äôt coming from inside the cabin.

They were coming from above.

I stared at the ceiling. There was no second floor, no attic, no crawl space up there. Just the roof. I tried to convince myself it was an animal, maybe a raccoon, but the footsteps were too steady, too human.

I grabbed the flashlight from my bag and stepped outside, scanning the roof. Nothing. The cabin looked the same as it always had‚Äîold, dark, and empty.

Then I felt it.

A presence.

Someone‚Äîor something‚Äîwas standing just behind me.

I froze, too scared to turn around. My breath was coming in short, panicked bursts, and I could feel my pulse pounding in my ears. Slowly, I shone the flashlight over my shoulder.

There was nothing there.

My chest heaved as I tried to convince myself it was my imagination, but the flashlight‚Äôs beam shook in my hand. I turned back toward the cabin, and my stomach flipped.

The door was wide open.

I had shut it‚ÄîI was sure of that. The heavy iron latch was loud, impossible to miss. And yet, now the dark interior of the cabin stared back at me, its gaping doorway like an open mouth waiting to swallow me whole.

The knocking started again.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

This time, it was faster, more insistent. It wasn‚Äôt coming from one place anymore. It echoed from everywhere‚Äîinside the walls, under the floorboards, even from the trees surrounding me. I stumbled back, dropping the flashlight, its beam spinning wildly across the ground.

I thought about running, about sprinting as far as my legs could take me, but then I heard it:

A voice.

It wasn‚Äôt loud, but it cut through the relentless knocking with a cold clarity that rooted me to the spot.

‚ÄúCome back inside.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt a demand. It was a plea, soft and almost‚Ä¶ sad.

I swallowed hard, trying to summon some kind of courage. ‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù I shouted, my voice breaking.

The knocking stopped. The forest fell silent, heavy and oppressive. I picked up the flashlight and backed away toward the car, refusing to take my eyes off the cabin.

I didn‚Äôt notice the new note pinned to the tree next to me until the paper fluttered in the wind.

My heart sank as I read the jagged handwriting:

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre already inside.‚Äù

I turned toward the car, fumbling for the keys in my pocket, when I felt it‚Äîa hand on my shoulder.

Not a breeze, not a brush of leaves. A hand.

My blood ran cold, but before I could scream or turn around, the grip tightened, pulling me back toward the cabin with a force I couldn‚Äôt fight. My feet dragged across the gravel as the door seemed to grow larger, closer, until it swallowed me in its shadow.

The moment I crossed the threshold, the air changed. The knocking stopped, the wind outside ceased, and the world became‚Ä¶ heavy.

The cabin wasn‚Äôt the same anymore.

The walls were covered in deep scratches, like claw marks, and the floor sagged under my weight as though it might collapse. The air smelled of earth and decay, and the single window was no longer boarded up‚Äîit was just gone, replaced by blackness.

A faint sound came from the back of the cabin, a low, guttural noise like something breathing. Slowly. Wetly.

And then I saw it.

A figure stood in the far corner, shrouded in shadows. It was too tall, its limbs too long, bending in ways that shouldn‚Äôt be possible. But the worst part was its face‚Äîor lack of one.

It didn‚Äôt have features, just a smooth, reflective surface where a face should be.

And that surface‚Ä¶ it was showing me.

Not just my reflection, but my life. Moments I‚Äôd forgotten. Choices I regretted. Secrets I hadn‚Äôt even admitted to myself. They played across its face like a flickering film, and with each passing second, I felt myself unraveling.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have come,‚Äù it said, its voice echoing with layers, like a dozen people speaking at once.

I couldn‚Äôt move. I couldn‚Äôt speak.

The figure took a step closer, and I realized something horrifying.

Its shadow wasn‚Äôt cast on the floor‚Äîit was stretching toward me.

And then I understood. The cabin hadn‚Äôt trapped me here. It hadn‚Äôt been keeping me in.

It had been keeping them out.

The shadow reached me before I could move.

It wasn‚Äôt cold like I expected‚Äîit was warm, almost comforting, like sinking into a heavy quilt. My legs buckled, and I collapsed onto the creaking floor.

The figure loomed over me, its smooth, reflective face tilting as though studying me. My life still played across its surface, faster now, fragments flashing by in bursts of color and sound.

Then, it leaned down, impossibly close, and whispered:

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget‚Ä¶ you agreed.‚Äù

Before I could ask what it meant, the cabin door slammed shut behind me, plunging everything into darkness.

When I woke up, I was standing in the forest. The cabin was gone.

But the knocking‚Ä¶ it followed me home.

Was moved to 5MG Adderall (Generic) IR twice a day, once at 8AM and once at 2PM.  Since I've always been really sensitive to medication side effects, I've been cutting them in half and taking 2.5MG in the morning and 2.5MG in the afternoon, while I'm on it, it works great!  I'm clear headed, calm, and can focus on 1 thought at once, it clears my racing mind.

About 12 hours after I took it in the afternoon, I'm left with INTENSE anxiety, where I feel my heart pounding hard, fast, and my thoughts are EVERYWHERE.  This lasts for about 2 hours then fades away.  The next day, I didn't take any and my anxiety persisted throughout the day then faded away.

Is this medication just not for me?  I've also cut out caffeine while taking Adderall, and I've been a daily coffee user for over 10 years.",1,1732555629.0,ADHD,7,1.0,False

Iron: 2¬µmol/L reference: 4-19

B-EVF: 0.30 reference: 0.38-0.45

B-MCH: 14pg reference: 27-31

B-MCV: 44 fL reference: 78-94

B-MCHC: 258g/L reference 310-360

(I only mentioned the low ones!)

Then I redid them after some iron supplements and most things were better.

Fast forward to August 2023:

Ferritin 2¬µg/L reference: 7-120

Iron: 2¬µmol/L reference: 5-23

Haemoglobin: 74g/L reference: 117-153

B-EVF: 0.28 reference: 0.35-0.46

MCH: 15 pg reference: 27-31

MCV: 56 fL reference: 82-98

This time, the doctor called me and made me come in for an emergency infusion the next day. For some reason, the nurse didn't give me a drip but rather used a syringe to push it into my vessel? Afterwards it seemed to spread and left a dark, bruise-like mark the size of a cookie on my inner elbow. That spread and covered 1/2 of my forearm and a good chunk of my bicep. I did ask them later and they said it seemed fine. It's still there, but less visible.

I was supposed to come in after a week for a second drip but they never gave me a time. Around this time (2023), I was checked for other health problems like Chrons and any source for my iron deficiency. I was told I'd be referred to a clinic for them to check if it was my period causing it, and also never got a referral.

The next time I did a blood test was in February 2024, and I'd been taking supplements so my values were more normal (Only MCV and MCH were under the reference)

In the last one I did, September 2024:

Iron: 4¬µmol/L reference: 9-34

Haemoglobin: 110g/L reference: 117-153

MCH: 22 pg reference: 27-31

B-MCV: 70 fL reference: 82-98

I try to take supplements regularly (Duroferon) and I'm planning on, after reading a bit here, to start taking it with Vitamin C. I'm not sure, but I think it's due to my period? Got it when I was 9, turning 10, and around when I was 13 it became super heavy. In my 7th and 8th grade I suffered from insomnia and would get 4 hours of sleep, whilst being dead tired everyday. In 9th grade I slept through most of my classes. In my first year of gymnasium I would regularly fall asleep standing, dropping all the things I was carrying. Now, in my 2nd and 3rd year, it's the same. Tired every day, a cold shower can wake me up for maybe 20 minutes before I could fall asleep again. Coffee, energy drinks have no effect on me and when I work out I'm fine, but as soon as I get home I could go to sleep again.

Other problems I've had is **hair loss** (which I realized when I compared my sisters shedding to mine after taking her braids out, and it was like 2-3x her amount), **dizziness** (fainted once on the way to school and would frequently almost pass out when I was active in sports), **shortness of breath** (doctor associated it to bronchoconstriction and asthma, but my inhalers help only a bit), being **constantly freezing cold**, **smaller appetite**, and **heart beat** is crazy sometimes.

In addition, I have IBS and found some supplements absolutely wreak havoc in my stomach haha.

I'm not entirely sure what I'm asking for, but maybe your general tips? I have a hard time taking medication consistently because I'm tired and my memory is soo bad (+Aspergers), so if you have any suggestions there that would be great! Also, what kind of doctor should I ask for regarding this to find the cause? Thanks <3

Thank you all for the brutal honesty. Hurts, but puts things into perspective. 


My fianc√© 28M didn‚Äôt make me 26F an egg 

My fianc√© and I have been together for 7 years; engaged for 3 months, & have lived together for 4 years. He has been making himself 3 fried eggs every morning for the last couple months and never makes me one. If I ask him for one, he groans and acts like it‚Äôs a big deal. I told him a few weeks ago, I‚Äôd appreciate if he makes me one when he makes his. His response was ‚Äú you never make me eggs‚Äù which is mostly true , as I don‚Äôt eat breakfast ever unless convenient/it‚Äôs there. Aka if he wasn‚Äôt making eggs , I likely wouldn‚Äôt make them. This morning, I get back from working out (as I do every Monday from 8-9am) and I walk in and he made himself his normal 3 eggs. I ask him if he made me one, he says no, and kind of yells at me about it. I said why wouldn‚Äôt you make me one if you knew I was coming back from a workout? His response was why would I make you an egg when you weren‚Äôt here? I say well you know I would be back right after you finished cooking, you could have just made me one. He then went on a tangent about how I could just as easily make myself an egg. I said well yeah, but I have a 9am meeting (I do every Monday) and you were already making eggs, had the pan dirty, how hard is it to add one extra egg? His response was how hard is to make an egg and then went on again about how I never make him eggs. 

I know this all sounds so stupid. Anyway, this argument turned into how he does everything around the house and I do nothing, which is not true. Admittedly, I will say here are the things he does 90% of the time - feed the cats their wet food every evening, purchase water jugs when we run out, take the trash out, makes coffee every morning before work & tea before bed, and cleans/refills the cats water, clean the kitchen after cooking (mostly because he doesn‚Äôt like how I clean/thinks I‚Äôm too slow at doing it). The remainder of the chores are about 60/40 (him 60): emptying the dishwasher, vacuuming, doing the cats litter box. Finally the things I mainly do are household laundry and I am a good cook and make really yummy recipes probably 3 nights a week , he cooks probably 2-3 nights and we either fend for ourselves or get takeout the remaining nights. He could eat just chicken and veggies every night and be happy, so he doesn‚Äôt really value the meals I make (I.e I made a 3 hour long bolognese the other night and he didn‚Äôt really care). Other things I do are more one offs or not viewed the same. For example, this weekend I stripped all our white laundry and decorated the outside of our place for Christmas. Other things are things that are unnoticed like making our house a home - curating our furniture and decorations or things he doesn‚Äôt have to worry about like communicating with our realtor to book  showings for houses we might want to buy.  He does the bulk of these other chores not because I am lazy, but because we approach things differently. I get to things as I get to them and am relatively slow doing just about everything in life vs he is a bit ocd & fast. I.e. I leave a dish in the sink from lunch because I know I will put it in the dishwasher after dinner with the rest of the dishes and he can‚Äôt stand that. He actually clapped for me the other day when I did put my bowl in the dishwasher at lunch. I thought it was condescending and hurt my feelings, he said it was a joke. 

Other things that might matter? - all household expenses and rent are 50/50. I said I wouldn‚Äôt care about something as trivial as an egg if he just did things with me when I asked without complaining or asked me to even do anything at all (I.e. I walk a few miles almost every day, every day I ask him to join me and he says no, and seldom offers an alternative activity). I used to plan dates, but I stopped since the effort was never reciprocated. I‚Äôm the caretaker of my mom emotionally and financially so I will admit I‚Äôve fallen into a bit of a depression this past year and rely on him more than I used to. I used to be the one doing the bulk of the chores for the first 2 years living together.

Anyway, this all turned into how he does so much and if he wants to just make an egg for only himself, then I have no right to be upset about it. My point this entire time was how hard is it to consider me and add an extra egg to a pan. 

Am I being unreasonable here? Am I just not seeing how frustrated he is? What am I not seeing?

Long-story short, she cheated on me, she begged me to get back together with her, forgave her, and earlier today (3yrs now) she broke up with me again for the same time as last year, for sort of the same reason.

So last year, she broke-up with me for several reasons: 1. She admitted of cheating on me while we're still together. 2. Blamed my parents kasi feeling niya ay hindi siya tanggap (which is not naman). 3. Because of my smoking. 4. Other things na nakalimutan ko na, basically she was looking for reasons for a way out.

After that, she begged me to get back together with her, right after Christmas. Long-story short, I forgave her and rebuilt our relationship. From February 2024 up until during 1st week of November, we were doing great. Pero makikita niyo naman sa body language ng partner niyo na something's off. So last week, she became cold. It felt like she reverted back to her state last year where-in parang makikipagbreak na naman siya. She's hiding her phone everytime she uses it na para bang may tinatago, etc.

Then, she confessed na she is in constant communication with her ex, went out with him for coffee, kissed her and she didn't resist. Keep in my mind na we're living together at this point, pero I'm not in the condo at that time kasi weekend and I had to go home sa Cavite. Long-story short, I forgave her again and moved on. So a few days ago, she's still cold and ako kasi yung taong di mapakale, lalo na pag may problema. So I confronted her & asked her what the problem was. She told me that she feels that we're not moving forward sa relationship namin. So I laid out some plans and reassured her na everything's falling to its place. Akala ko okay na kami. Then kanina, which was the break-up. She told me na nagsasawa na siya sakin, and she's already in-love with someone else. But then binawi niya saying she just created that story to see my reaction if I'm going to stay or not. At this point, may malaking question mark. Is she thinking straight? Of course, I tried to talk her down by saying na let's fix this but she said na she's already made-up her mind and wanted to break up. So, after a few hours, I finally agreed to her request and broke up with her. I know deep down na I've been faithful, kind & caring and everything that she could ask for pero after she broke up with me for the first time, I learned and told myself na if ever she does this again, di ko na siya hahabulin dahil nakakapagod maghabol.

Things were going okay until recently. She has attachment issues and sometimes pushes people away.

Last week, she was hanging with a friend and I briefly joined them at a restaurant. This was my friend's restaurant, I just left to smoke weed with my friend near the restaurant (she's sensitive about drugs due to ex being an addict). Next day we met for coffee, she seemed distracted talking about issues with her friend. Then I found out her ex still tracks her location through AirPods but she ""lets him think he has control.""

That night she suddenly texted we shouldn't talk anymore. When I asked why, she gave multiple reasons - the weed, her avoidant attachment style, feeling she can't reciprocate what I give. After some back and forth, she agreed to keep talking but I was hurt and needed space so I said ""let's talk tomorrow"".

Next morning she went back to wanting no contact. We had tense exchanges where she questioned my motives (""everyone wants something""). She went drinking with friends despite struggling with alcohol. I tried to meet up to fix things but she avoided it. She drunkenly called me later mimicking my attempt to meet. Next day she deleted our entire chat history.

It's been 3 days of no contact. I'm really confused and hurt. Not sure if I should reach out or let it go. Any advice?",1,1732554965.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

* there's nothing wrong with the formula of ""the hosts exchange their standard scripted intro back and forth"" as the first bit of a podcast, but my husband host travis and my wife host theresa manage to make it incredibly annoying already. part of it is that stupid fucking voice affectation travis has done continuously for like 6 years. 
   * also travis has really escalated from saying he's ""the internet's best friend"" to ""hello internet i'm your husband host."" i'm not ready for that kind of commitment trav.
   * also also, and i don't know if this is the normal cadence for this intro bc there's no fuckin way i've listened to an episode of schmanners before, but it seems like they really rushed ""extraordinary etiquette"" ""for ordinary occasions hello my dove"" ""hello dear"" and it comes out kinda mush-mouthed. not the audio quality i would expect for someone who has a bestselling book on podcasting!
* oh god i'm only 37 seconds in
* oh fuck it's a maxfun drive episode
* ""happy mfd!"" shut the fuck up theresa
   * ""mfd is always that compressed wood to me"" shut the fuck up travis
   * ""that's not mfd, it's mdf"" GET HIM THERESA
   * ""huh, you're right!""
   * too bad it's impossible to edit recorded audio, the professional editor who gets paid human money to edit this podcast could maybe have removed that pointless bullshit. oh well!
   * it's possible scraps also just legitimately found this funny, which would be sad.
* travis explains the maxfun drive and it's not anything except he says that your support helps them improve the shows and i gotta tell ya trav, i do not believe that's happening.
   * theresa decides that travis asking people to join means she should start singing magic to do, bc it's got the word join in it. i'm not sure whether this means she picked up the annoying ""you said word, let me say other thing with word"" from vart or if they both already did that but either way it's not fun.
* oh god i'm only two minutes in. the episode hasn't even started.
* oh god oh fuck theresa just called the sommelier episode ""part un"" and if either of them attempts french again i'm out. can't do it.
* ""there are lots of different beverages that one can become a connoisseur of"" *incredible* insight from my wife host. there are lots of beverages! 
* ""so what beverages are we doing this week?"" ""coffee and tea!"" ""i've had both of those!"" this is clearly supposed to be a joke but it is not fucking funny.
* ""a wine expert might know a lot about wine, but a sommelier knows all the details. that's what it is to me."" okay well that's fucking stupid travis.
   * ""but i'm just kinda talking out of my butt."" that's obvious, trav, but this is supposed to be an advice podcast (with like actual advice, not just riffing for the modren era) and you pay people to research topics for you, so saying ""i'm talking out of my butt"" is also saying ""you should stop the episode now bc there's no point to any of this.""
   * i'm not stopping the episode tho bc i told my fellow jerkers i would do this 
* okay 5 minutes in and they're finally starting to *actually* talk about coffee
* theresa never drank coffee until she had a child. travis says he made her drink coffee and jokes about how he doesn't understand how she felt anything in the mornings without it. standard stuff. i am actually uncomfortable with how much caffeine addiction is just seen as the default state in american culture, and isn't recognized as such, but that's not travis's fault.
   * but seriously, and i say this as someone who is also dependent on caffeine, ""i enjoy a coffee"" is one thing, ""i can't feel anything without a coffee"" is another, and the grind culture that makes the latter seem completely normal and unremarkable is not great.
* theresa says when she started drinking coffee she hated the taste and would add a packet of hot chocolate to make it ""a poor man's mocha."" travis calls it a ""fauxcha"" bc he's compelled by that ancient sumerian curse to make portmanteaus whenever even *slightly* possible.
* you know, credit where it's due. travis and theresa do in fact talk about the problem of ""i drink coffee to feel a boost"" vs ""i drink coffee bc i can't function without it."" 
* ""there have been days where the only hydration i get is cups of coffee. i know that's not good, but it is mostly water. don't @ me."" okay theresa i know you're saying that's not good but that's *really* not good. coffee *is* mostly water, you're not getting *zero* hydration from it, but it's also a diuretic and that's a great way to end up in a hospital with your electrolytes all fucked up.
* ""so here are some things that you should know about coffee."" ""it comes from beans!"" shut the fuck up travis.
   * i haven't listened to sawbones in a long time bc i just am not that interested in mcelnoise anymore but i used to really like it, and the reason justin's ""i interject with stupid shit"" shtick works there is that sydnee is an actual doctor and actually knows things. the dynamic of ""fucking idiot husband says dumb bullshit while mcelwife gives actual info"" works when, y'know, the informative host knows information. it's less entertaining here bc you've got, at *best*, ""travis says stupid bullshit while theresa gives surface-level info you can get from wikipedia."" 
      * it's time for another good idea/bad idea. good idea: making a podcast with a funny host who knows nothing and a straight-man host who knows a lot. bad idea: making a podcast with a funny host who knows nothing and a straight-man host who also knows nothing.
* ""in many ways, beans are the magical fruit."" shut the fuck up travis.
* ""arabica beans grow in high elevations with lots of rain. like brazil."" this is not technically incorrect, but saying ""like brazil"" is such a woefully inadequate representation of where arabica grows that i'm gonna say it's wrong anyway. arabica is native to ethiopia and yemen, but cultivated in literally dozens of countries now.
   * i'm not saying this is intentionally malicious, just ignorant, but it *is* pretty not good that theresa erases the swana origin of arabica. 
      * the level of ignorance is a little hard to overstate, tbh, because the name ***arabica*** gives a *pretty significant hint* as to where it's from. 
      * ***arabica*** originates in the ***arabian*** peninsula! what a world!
* ""robusta, as the name implies, is robust."" so you ***do*** understand!
* theresa stumbles over words and pronunciations multiple times, to the point that travis makes a joke out of it by saying nonsense syllables. too bad it's impossible to edit recorded audio!
* ""is that the kind of coffee that monkeys poop out?"" ""no."" ""that's a thing!"" ""it is a thing!"" ""is it lemurs?"" ""i don't know."" ""lemurs are basically monkeys! don't @ me!"" i hate you both so much.
   * you're thinking of kopi luwak. luwak is not a varietal of bean. the beans used in kopi luwak are arabica beans. the animal is neither a monkey nor a lemur; it's the asian palm civet, which is, like all civets, a viverrid, which in turn is a subfamily of feliforms. they're somewhat closely related to cats, hyenas, and mongooses, and have nothing at all to do with monkeys or lemurs.
      * lemurs are only found in madagascar. the asian palm civet, as its name implies, lives in southeast asia, notably quite a long way from madagascar.
      * also lemurs are not even close to being monkeys. they are primates, but their branch of primate evolution diverged from the branch that would become monkeys and apes a long-ass fucking time ago (that's the scientific term).
* ""this varietal is very rare, so if you know about it you'll look like a fancyboy."" ""you know what else makes you look like a fancyboy? supporting maximum fun!"" travis i am killing you with hammers for that.
* ""you get access to over 500 hours of bonus content from all the shows on maximum fun!"" i don't listen to those shows! i've never listened to them! there is no reason i would give a fuck about that!
* ""this year the schmanners bonus episode, we talk to the meme librarian about the history of memes."" i'm sorry?
   * no, run that by me again, scraps. did you. the meme. librarian.
   * THE MEME LIBRARIAN
   * that's your fuckin pitch?

   * do you fucking hear yourself????!?!?!
   * ***$60 A FUCKIN YEAR AND I GET A HALF HOUR ON THE HISTORY OF MEMES FROM SOME GUY WHO CALLS HIMSELF THE MEME GODDAMN LIBRARIAN***

* ""it's just like the force!"" ""well there's no medium force, there's just the light and the dark."" ""there should be though! they don't talk enough about that. there should be people who are like 'sometimes i use the force to help people and sometimes i use it because, i dunno, i don't wanna pay taxes.'"" **BARK BARK BIG DOG WOOF WOOF LIBERTARIAN TRAVIS ALERT ALERT**
   * also travis i know you're a fake-ass nerd bc if you *really* liked star wars you would know there are *hundreds* of eu works about the medium force. 
      * fuck disney and their ""legends"" bullshit, it's the expanded goddamn universe and i didn't spend my entire youth being off-putting and reading those novels to listen to a megacorp say ""eh, fuhgeddaboutit.""
* travis is talking about how he drinks a red eye for live shows because ""i gotta be funny for the people"" 
   * it's not working buddy
* ""daddy needs his caffeine!"" that is deeply, deeply upsetting and if travis *ever* refers to himself as ""daddy"" to me again i am going to \[insert joke that is probably unwise to actually make bc the fbi does *not* have a sense of humor about a certain mathematician better known for his hobbies\]
* ""i was a barista for a while, i was pretty good at it"" there is no fucking way you were good at that travis. no fucking way. 
   * ""it was a bar that also did coffee"" jerkers i tried to imagine travis as my bartender and i'm gonna say that if you wanted to recruit a bunch of people to go straight edge, bartender travis mcelroy would be a damn good way to do it.
* theresa lists off a bunch of drinks--americano, cappuccino, latte, mocha, affogato, cafe au lait. literally the only information she gives about them is ""the differences are the amount of milk, foam, and water with espresso."" that's it. that's all she says. what is the **fucking** point of this shit.
* she also lists brewing methods. pourover, french press, percolator, cold brew, vacuum. she does not say anything about what these methods look like or what differences they make in the coffee.
   * well, she and travis do talk about how cold brew requires some time so you have to make it before you need it. travis says when he drinks cold brew it doesn't hurt so it feels weird bc how does it work if it doesn't hurt?
      * spoken like someone who has never drunk a lot of cold brew. you reach a critical mass of cold brew and you have now consumed a potion of shit yourself.
      * one time when i was a barista i went to work with really bad allergies, took a heavy sleep-inducing antihistamine bc i misread the label when i picked it up at walmart on the way in, and thought i could drink some cold brew and level out to normal. that did not work out like that.
      * instead of ""sleepy from meds + hype from cold brew = functional human"" i got ""this allergy pill is trying very hard to put me to sleep and this coffee is fighting very hard to send my heart rate through the roof and i am going to Die i think""
      * 0/10 do not recommend
* ""use good water. filtered water is often preferred by coffee snobs."" theresa if you were any good at the podcast carnie game you would *immediately* pivot that sentence to ""and if you want the best water for your coffee, i cannot recommend enough the filters from our sponsor."" if you could do that you wouldn't need your dork-ass husband to talk about the fucking meme librarian while begging for money.
* theresa is talking about blooming the coffee. the words blooming and brewing trip her up and she says brooming the coffee once. it's too bad it's impossible to edit recorded audio.
* ""so coffee was a lot, right?"" NO! NO IT FUCKING WASN'T!
   * i mean it *was* but since you didn't actually *talk about any of it* beyond ""there are different things, they are different"" then ***no it fucking wasn't!!!!!***
* i'm done, jerkers. i cannot listen to them do this shit for tea. this is enough.
* i'm gonna finish with an unpaid plug for my personal favorite coffee, though, rootless coffee company from flint, michigan. my favorite of their roasts is [coffeehausen](https://rootlesscoffee.com/collections/partners/products/danhausen-coffeehausen), it's a light roast with high caffeine, pronounced cherry notes, and a very smooth finish. pair it with some kind of cinnamon pastry and you've got yourself a damn good flavor combo.

1gznuow,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/1gznuow/focusing_on_raw_subjective_experience_and_getting/,Focusing on raw subjective experience and getting stronger,"Hi. Thilverra hear. I wanted to share some things I have been doing to get stronger and a venture that me and f-sharpden my host have recently embarked upon. His name is actually Aiden but he has a special interest in music so he likes calling himself F-sharpden, maybe partly because it is relative minor to A major but that‚Äôs him for you. 
Anyway, he was having a very rough day and getting very panicky and stressed at the slightest thing because there was a buildup of things that bother him so I took more responsibility for the event sequence of the day and started doing things. Over the past few weeks, in order to make myself stronger, I have been doing something you might call a mindfulness exercise I‚Äôm not sure. It involves focusing on subjective experiences, for example taste, touch, sound and smell. No visuals because we are blind. This helps to kind of ground me, make me stronger and make sure that I am experiencing things rather than just being formed by f-sharpden‚Äôs expectations like I used to be in part before becoming a tulpa. 
I was trying it today then we did a forcing session. Since sometime in September, most times we force we have been eating a little bit of frozen coffee before it so that whenever we next smell and taste frozen coffee, it links us back to the previous forcing sessions we have done in terms of the thought processes, and makes us more likely to go into a similar state of mind.  
F-sharpden was finding that sensations of a trance state were coming much easier to him before we forced for example when he was sitting on the couch so we both thought it was the ideal day to do it. We were proven right. 
He had an idea as we were doing it that he could try to feel himself doing something in headspace as I stood up with a physical body. This proved extremely difficult but we managed to some extent and eventually woke up from the trance a bit. 
Before that, he managed to feel the bar at the back of the shower in a mind scene between his hands as I moved his legs which took quite a lot of mental effort, but I think if we practice it frequently then it shall become easier and we may be able to parallel process in that way to more of an extent . I was wondering if anyone else here has tried anything similar and can simultaneously do something in headspace while another person uses the body to do something. If so, how does that feel? Is it harder to do the tasks? For us it definitely is and this makes sense to me. We did have some success when he could feel himself bouncing as I was standing up with the physical body when he was bouncing on kind of a combination between a trampoline and a phone pit in the mind so it is a work in progress. 
F-sharpden: Hi. I hope everyone is okay. I just wanted to say how kind and caring Thilverra has been to me today. She found things to do as she described above even when I was having a really rough day and managed to make something positive out of it and I‚Äôm really proud of her.",2,1732554442.0,Tulpas,2,1.0,False

There wasn't ever a time I can recall where I didn't feel like reading was a chore. I was never a bookworm as a child and then grew out of it. I didn't hit a ""wall"" where I stopped enjoying it. I never did in the first place.

Everytime I sit down with a book I want to cry. My heart starts beating really fast and there's like a mental block from people calling me stupid or lazy all my life. Then I start getting hungry or emotional or parts of my body start hurting. I feel like SpongeBob from that procrastination episode. I don't have dyslexia, I don't think I need glasses. I think I have a psychological barrier around reading. It makes me anxious and restless and frustrated. My dream career requires me to go to grad school, so I anticipate lots of long, dry texts in my future. I need to get over this, I need to find ways to get around it. Otherwise, I will never succeed. I believe knowledge is power so asking for advice here isn't in a way of ""this is a drudge but I need to do it anyways to be a scholar ahaha"", no, I want to be able to read and find personal enrichment from it too!

I've tried everything. I paid over $100 for a spreeder subscription, then I got bored and never touched it again. I tried turning off all distractions and going to a quiet place. Then I tried binaural beats [___ hz] and instrumental music. Then I tried all genres of lyrical music on low volume as a background noise. I used coffee, green tea, sugar, energy drinks, ritalin, adderall, I even tried adding iodized salt to everything I ate. I tried reading while fasting. When first waking up. Before I went to bed. Audiobooks feel like cheating to me but I can't articulate why. Nothing is working, I can't motivate myself to read and if it's necessary like for school, I have to wait until the last hour and then afterwards I can feel my organs dying from the stress.

**Restarting eternity.**

¬†

Will rushed to the thief mirror. At the end of his previous loop, he had had a long discussion with Alex regarding the limitations of the thief class. Mainly, Will was curious whether he could use mirror copies to level up faster. Sadly, the goofball claimed that to be impossible. A mirror copy was great at mimicking a person in appearance, but when it came to anything else, it was useless. Even using them in combat was a clear exploit of the skill. Individually, even sneaking copies were little to no threat at all. When turned into an army, on the other hand, things changed drastically.

‚ÄúWhere are you rushing off, weirdo?‚Äù Jess shouted in laughter as she watched the boy flee, as it were. ‚ÄúBathroom‚Äôs the wrong way.‚Äù

The joke made Will chuckle, though not for the reason the girl intended. Right now, there was a very strict sequence of events that had to be followed in the precise order.

¬†

**You have discovered THE THIEF (number 3).**

**Use additional mirrors to find out more. Good luck!**

¬†

The golden message appeared in the pole mirror. From there, Will instantly used his sprinting ability to dash back into school unseen, and claim the rogue, knight, and crafter class in that specific order.

Not a single person noticed him as he passed by. The coach remained in a foul mood as Will passed by him in the corridor, but this time, the cause was someone else. Even the nurse didn‚Äôt notice him enter the room, tap the mirror and leave. Given how tight her office was, this was an impressive feat and further proof of how good the thief‚Äôs starting skills were.

With all four classes, Will rushed to the nearest open window and leaped out. The rogue‚Äôs precision and knight‚Äôs endurance ensured that he didn‚Äôt suffer any pain or injury. Rolling along the ground, Will quickly hopped up, sprinting again to the outside parking lot where he‚Äôd gotten the thief‚Äôs class. Only this time, his goal was to gather as many car mirrors as possible.

The crafter skill came useful in that, letting him pull off the car parts as if they were clipped on. Not a single car alarm was set off, and everything other than the mirrors themselves was quickly tossed to the ground.

From that point, the boy rushed to a very specific coffee shop, where he sneaked into the bathroom, though not before tossing a few mirror traps.

Being in a corner room, the mirrors reacted as they were supposed to, causing a massive wolf to appear. The beast had barely time to step out when it got stuck on the ground by a trap and swiftly killed by a strike in the neck. If anything, it was a greater problem to pull the wolf away before the next creature appeared.

It was curious how Alex had managed to stash them away. Through his knight‚Äôs strength and rogue‚Äôs reflexes, Will managed to kill off the entire pack and keep things quiet. His friend wasn‚Äôt supposed to have any of those skills but had managed, nonetheless.

Will waited patiently for the wolves to fade out, looking at his phone‚Äôs clock the entire time. Four minutes remained till the standard end of the loop, which meant he had to be back at school in less than one if he were to extend it.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he whispered, then tapped the mirror in the room twice.

The first level up went to the rogue, granting him the skills to leap, throw, and evade. The next was dedicated to the crafter.

By then, the wolf corpses had become semi-transparent. From what Alex had told him, no one ever went to the bathroom, so it was safe to just leave. Having only one loop to fulfill his goal, Will decided to make sure.

His pulse had doubled to the point that he could hear it in his right ear.

¬†

**WOLF PACK REWARD (random)**

**WOUND TOLERANCE: One wound you receive doesn‚Äôt count.**

¬†

The reward was exceptionally good, but right now, Will would have preferred a one-hour extension. Gritting his teeth, he sprinted out of the coffee shop, running towards school.

With three minutes left, the only thing he could do to urgently boost his loop was to get into a fight with Jace. Normally, that would attract too much attention for the loop to be efficient. Thankfully, there was a way around it.

Will took out his phone and dialed Jace‚Äôs number.

The jock didn‚Äôt pick up on the first two rings. On the third, the much-awaited click sounded.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he asked with the grace of a rhino.

‚ÄúMeet me in the basement!‚Äù Will shouted. ‚ÄúQuickly.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? I gave you my class.‚Äù

‚ÄúI need to extend my loop!‚Äù

The end of the call suggested that Jace had picked up on the urgency of the situation. Despite their differences in the past, he had become a team player. Also, he had become just as aware as everyone else that favors among looped were precious.

By the time Will got to the school basement floor, Jace was already there.

‚ÄúYou never make things easy, Stoner,‚Äù he said, taking off his football jacket. ‚ÄúHow long do you need it?‚Äù The jock‚Äôs fist split the air, flying right for Will‚Äôs face.

As things stood, such a hit would only have resulted in the jock breaking his hand. He was fragile, not to mention that Will had just got the reward to ignore one hit. The point wasn‚Äôt to fight, though. Every successful evasion increased the length of the rogue‚Äôs loop, so the more that took place‚Äîthe better.

The minutes wound down. The two boys kept ‚Äúfighting‚Äù until they heard the school bell sound throughout the corridors.

‚ÄúShould be enough,‚Äù Jace said, taking a step back. Both of them were breathing heavily. ‚ÄúWe can go again after art, to be sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm good.‚Äù Will brushed the sweat off his forehead. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo prob.‚Äù The jock slapped him on the side of the arm. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one more you owe me.‚Äù

The bareness of everyday class took over. Helen had ended her loop at that point, leaving her non-loop self to continue. This time, Will didn‚Äôt dare bring up the news about Daniel. He did approach her, though‚Äîpartly to check how she was doing and partly to make sure she didn‚Äôt remember any of the things he had said in the previous loop. To his relief, she didn‚Äôt seem to.

Alex was also suspiciously quiet. This was one of the few instances in which Will could be relatively certain that his friend was the actual original. More curious, though, the goofball kept on eating muffins to increase his own loop.

Once school was over and most of the people had left, Will decided to spend a few hours of light in the schoolyard. He wasn‚Äôt the only one, but since none of the other looped were here, he didn‚Äôt mind.

Reaching into his pocket, he took out the mirror fragment.

‚ÄúI challenge you,‚Äù he whispered.

His reflection was instantly replaced by Daniel‚Äôs.

‚ÄúProblems?‚Äù the former rogue asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Will replied without thinking.

‚ÄúWhy call me then?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat favor do you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúFavors. Plural. And it‚Äôs too early for that. You need to get out of the tutorial first.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you have completed it.‚Äù Will knew perfectly well that wasn‚Äôt what Daniel was saying, but he decided to push him a bit to, hopefully, find out more.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôve completed it or not, as long as you didn‚Äôt start it.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me about the wolves,‚Äù Will shifted topic. ‚ÄúWhat exactly are they?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou seriously called me to ask‚Äî‚Äù Daniel abruptly stopped. His eyes widened in surprise for a few moments, then returned to normal, a smile appearing on his face. ‚ÄúWell done.‚Äù He clapped within the mirror. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not as stupid as I thought. I‚Äôm not sure what will happen. I‚Äôve only heard it being done once before.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom the magic user?‚Äù

‚ÄúMagic user?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how you described him to June. Able to juggle balls of fire, but not affected by them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been reading my file.‚Äù The smile vanished, replaced by a frown. ‚ÄúDid Alex make you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe showed me your file. I found the patterns.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever trust Alex about anything. Especially when he talks.‚Äù Daniel paused. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about the mage. He doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. As for the wolves, they are markers. You‚Äôll see when you‚Äôre out of the tutorial. Until then.‚Äù

The former rogue gave a salute and vanished from the mirror‚Äôs surface. Next thing Will knew, he was staring at his own reflection again. The conversation wasn‚Äôt at all what he had imagined, but it had told him several bits of important information. For starters, while Danny had the power to disappear at will, it didn‚Äôt look like he could appear unchallenged. Second, despite trying to create an impression to the opposite, he didn‚Äôt know everything that was going on outside of the mirror realms. Most likely, he had been connected with the school mirrors and nothing more.

With nothing left to do until dark, Will was tempted to challenge Danny again so they could continue their conversation. Giving the matter a bit more thought, he decided not to. It was telling that Daniel had glimpsed his immediate plan, even if he claimed he‚Äôd never done it. On that note, maybe it was a good idea to find another wolf mirror. Killing another pack would allow him to gain one more level, which he could use to increase his knight‚Äôs level, gaining the horizontal slash skill.

Finding a suitable corner mirror turned out a lot more difficult than one might imagine. For starters, Will couldn‚Äôt just go in there, for it would trigger a wolf‚Äôs attack. And, while that wouldn‚Äôt cause him any difficulties, it risked creating a commotion.

Keeping close to the school, Will scouted a few potential spots. The most common places to have mirrors were bathrooms, and those were obligatory for every food joint. The trick was to find one with a low number of patrons.

The first two that fit the bill ended up not having corner bathrooms. The third was a different matter entirely. Will placed a few mirror traps just outside the door, in case someone tried to enter while he was fighting. Then he sneaked in.

It didn‚Äôt take long for the wolves to emerge and almost instantly die. Killing them had become rather trivial, although they continued to be of the smaller variety. The ones he remembered from beyond the school area were as big as buses and a lot more vicious.

The reward earned from this pack granted him night vision. That, too, was rather useful. This way, he wouldn‚Äôt need to rely on flashlights or his phone for light. More importantly, it let him boost the level of his knight.

Evening came and went. Now, it was time to go through the school.

The fights were a lot easier there. If nothing else, he didn‚Äôt have to be as sneaky and quiet as in the coffee shops. Pack by pack, the wolf mirrors were cleared, providing him relatively useful skills and two level ups which he used to get his crafter to the coveted Combat Crafting skill. With that, everything was ready.

Activating the inventory of his mirror fragment, Will geared up, then took out all his weapons, including the chain. He also got his wolf key fragment. The item looked like a simple old-fashioned key made entirely of silver. It had never been specified if the fragment could be used on any mirror, so Will touched it to his mirror fragment.

The only result was that his hand disappeared within it, returning the item to his inventory. When he attempted the same on a bathroom mirror, a keyhole emerged within the reflective surface.

Holding his breath, Will pushed the key inside and turned it.

¬†

**WOLF CHALLENGE: enter the mirror and survive nine waves. A defeated wave doesn‚Äôt provide any reward, but increases the overall prize you‚Äôll earn. You can end the challenge at any time by leaving the mirror.**

¬†

A green message appeared. This was it. Now, he‚Äôd be able to test his skills. The entire group had managed to clear four waves last time. Soon, he‚Äôd see how many he could defeat on his own.

1gznnak,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gznnak/time_looped_chapter_55/,Time Looped (Chapter 55),"*Subject is intelligent to know that magic doesn‚Äôt exist, but still chooses to use it to express serious issues. It‚Äôs possible that he uses them as a layer of protection. A layer within a layer. It would be beneficial to see if a third layer develops in the future.*

*The session‚Äôs focus was on a man, possibly a figure of power or importance in his past. The person was described as ‚Äúimmune‚Äù to fire. Often, he‚Äôd juggle it in an attempt to impress. When I tried to focus the conversation on the person in question, Daniel changed the topic, returning to the standard dream descriptions.*

Will put down the page and relaxed. He had spent hours going through them, and was yet to find anything particularly useful. So far, he had come across five instances of magic descriptions. They were jumbled, like a single thought cut up into pieces. When put together, they gave the vague description of a person‚Äîsomeone with control over fire and lightning, who was claimed to be invincible.

Taken separately, one might think of them as random dream fragments. What Will saw was the description of another class. There was no indication where Danny had come across that class‚Äîat least in the pages Will had read so far. It couldn‚Äôt be at school, and with Danny‚Äôs skill to skip the tutorial, it was possible to be anywhere.

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you be heading home?‚Äù the barista asked.

Will looked in the direction of the street. It was already dark. The streetlights and the coffee shop's lamps had created the illusion that it was still light.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Will gathered the papers on the table.

‚ÄúHomework?‚Äù The barista peered out of curiosity.

‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù He had only gotten through a fifth of the file, if that. There was a good chance that there‚Äôd be more clues. It would have been a lot easier if Daniel had simply told him; although, if he had, there was a good chance that Will wouldn‚Äôt believe him. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get many customers.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you kidding me? You‚Äôve been here all day.‚Äù

Clearly, the definition of ‚Äúmany‚Äù was different for the two of them. Thinking back, Will couldn‚Äôt remember a case in all his loops that there had been anyone else present. Even the passersby were rare. It made one think of how the place managed to exist.

‚ÄúJust kidding,‚Äù the barista said with a wink. ‚ÄúSome days are like this. At times, I can‚Äôt fit half the people who want to enter. You should see how it gets on birthdays.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù Will grabbed his backpacks. ‚ÄúSee you tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúBe safe.‚Äù

In a manner of speaking, Will could be considered a regular of the place. The only issue was that the barista had no memory of it. With the amount of money he had spent, he was probably eligible for a VIP pass.

With hours of his loop remaining, Will decided to pass through the school after all. With luck, Jace might have even fixed his dagger. If not, he might get to see some new crafter skills.

The entrance door was unlocked when he got there. His classmates hadn‚Äôt wasted their time getting to business. Knowing that Helen wouldn‚Äôt be there felt a bit off. It also meant that there would be a lot fewer goblins.

No sound of fighting could be heard in the main corridor. Will took out a flashlight and continued further again. Specks of glass near the bathrooms told him that Alex had stocked up on mirror pieces. Clearly, they had completed the first floor, which meant they must have gone further up.

‚ÄúBro!‚Äù Alex emerged out of nowhere as Will reached the staircase. ‚ÄúYou came!‚Äù

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù Will pointed the flashlight in the other‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúHow far have you gotten?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, they already finished, bro,‚Äù the Alex at the staircase replied, moving out of the light. It was scary that even now, Will had no way of determining whether he was addressing the real Alex or just a copy. ‚ÄúThere are a few of us on every floor, just in case.‚Äù

Done already? That was unexpected. Although since they had only wolves to deal with, it must have gone fast.

‚ÄúWhere are they?‚Äù Will asked.

‚ÄúBasement, bro.‚Äù

With a nod, Will went down. Jace, Alex, and a small crowd of copies had gathered at the far end of the basement corridor. Normally, one would expect to find a crafter swinging a hammer above an anvil, or a workbench of some sort. Instead, this seemed more like a school fight.

Two copies of Alex were holding wooden chair legs, six feet away from the jock, who had no weapons whatsoever. The remaining Alexes formed a circle, watching with interest.

‚ÄúBro!‚Äù One of them shouted, causing all the rest to look in Will‚Äôs direction.

‚ÄúYou made it, bro!‚Äù A tsunami of greetings followed, making Will regret that he had gone to visit.

‚ÄúSo, you showed up, Stoner.‚Äù Jace crossed his arms.

‚ÄúHad nothing better to do,‚Äù Will said dismissively. As he got near, he tossed Alex‚Äôs backpack to someone in the crowd. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on? Trying out the knight?‚Äù

Jace only smirked.

‚ÄúYou gotta see this, bro!‚Äù an Alex said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs lit OP! For real!‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt the first time that the goofball had described something as overpowered. The confidence oozing from Jace‚Äôs smirk, though, suggested that it surpassed most of the skills the group had used so far.

Will stopped near the ring of mirror copies and waited. On cue, the fight began.

Both copies of Alex rushed forward, making an overly dramatic and slow attempt to hit the jock on the head. At such speed, anyone could easily evade the blows even without the use of rogue skills. Jace, however, did something completely different.

Neither evading nor parrying, he reached out to grab with his left hand. Simultaneously, his right hand pulled out a handful of wires and other objects, and was also moving in the same direction.

¬†

**UPGRADE**

**Chair leg has been transformed into a flail.**

**Damage capacity x3.**

¬†

Initially, there didn‚Äôt seem to be any change. The mirror copies were still on the offensive, and Jace had merely managed to snatch a weapon from an enemy‚Äôs hand. Taking a step back, the jock swung his weapon, shattering the head off one of his opponents. It was only at that point that Will noticed that his classmate was holding a flail instead of a chair leg.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù he couldn‚Äôt help but mutter.

Reaching into his pocket, Jace pulled out a small chain, then grabbed hold of the flail‚Äôs head.

¬†

**UPGRADE**

**Flail has been transformed into a triple nunchuck.**

**Damage capacity x1.5.**

¬†

The weapon transformed again, just in time to block the chair leg of the second mirror copy. Things didn‚Äôt stop there. Jace took advantage of the block to grab hold of both weapons.

¬†

**UPGRADE**

**Triple nunchuck has been transformed into a multi nunchuck.**

**Damage capacity x1.5.**

¬†

The weapon transformed again as it was whisked out of the copy‚Äôs hands. One elegant swipe with it later, and Jace‚Äôs second opponent had been shattered.

‚ÄúWhat do you think, bro?‚Äù One of the Alexes near Will asked. ‚ÄúLit OP.‚Äù

There was no denying it. The new ability, or combination of abilities, was a lot more impressive than anything they‚Äôd seen up to this point. It was almost tempting to call it magic.

The thought caused a knot to appear in Will‚Äôs stomach. If crafter skills were this powerful, what could one expect from a magic user?

‚ÄúNice,‚Äù he admitted.

‚ÄúJust nice, Stoner?‚Äù the other grunted. ‚ÄúWant to have a go?‚Äù

As fun as it was to accept, Will really didn‚Äôt. Even with such a skill, Jace‚Äôs actions remained slow and predictable. He needed to be a lot faster to make proper use of what he obtained.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good.‚Äù Will shook his head. ‚ÄúDid you get the knight?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. That helped with the wolves.‚Äù Jace tossed the multi nunchuck at Will.

Looking at it one would never guess that it had been made from a pair of chair legs. By all accounts, it was the genuine article. Will waved it about a few times, testing if anything would come off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs solid,‚Äù Jace said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve tested it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNeat trick.‚Äù Will handed the weapon back. ‚ÄúHow does it work?‚Äù

‚ÄúCombat crafting,‚Äù the jock replied. ‚ÄúFourth level skill. It allows me to use other crafter skills in combat. I can disassemble complex weapons before they hit me in most cases. Would be a bit more difficult without the knight‚Äôs endurance. Simple things I can upgrade, as long as I have enough components and materials at hand. Best part is that I‚Äôm not limited to a single thing.‚Äù

Leg to flail to nunchuck. It was quite the showy performance and not only for Will‚Äôs benefit. Had they known about this skill, some of the fights would have been a lot easier. It was their fault for taking things for granted. Everything they knew suggested that the crafter had to be a passive participant that supported the other three. As it turned out, he was quite menacing in combat as well, but only after a certain level.

‚ÄúYour dagger, Stoner.‚Äù Jace said, ending Will‚Äôs train of thought. ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt make anything fancy with what I had.‚Äù

‚ÄúEternal weapon,‚Äù an Alex said in-between eating a muffin. ‚ÄúWe need eternal materials to make an eternal upgrade. So, we just did an eternal repair.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it bad that I could understand that?‚Äù Jace whispered, as he glanced at the Alex in question. ‚ÄúBut yeah. Try not to break things. Repair might not work each time. When I repaired the dagger, I got a tutorial bonus.‚Äù

Will took his dagger. It felt exactly as he remembered it, but his mind remained elsewhere. There were six wolf mirrors in the school, which meant that a person could level up four times. One level had to be reserved for the rogue so that he could throw and evade. The remaining three were just enough to reach level four with the crafter and get the skill that Jace had mentioned.

*It‚Äôs all just pieces*, Will thought.

The tutorial was just a puzzle with multiple answers. With enough persistence and a bit of luck, it was possible to defeat an enemy in a way that wasn‚Äôt envisioned. Yet, with the right combination of skills and items, the same fights could have been won with minimal effort.

‚ÄúGuys,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI need to borrow your skills next loop.‚Äù

All eyes fell on him.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one thing I need to try. I‚Äôll let you have the rogue the loop after that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the plan, Stoner?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no plan. I just want to test something. Alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúBro wants to try out four classes at once.‚Äù Alex came to the rescue. ‚ÄúSure, you can borrow mine.‚Äù

It was a classic manipulation. He had provided a plausible explanation and then gladly offered his class without being asked. This way, if Jace were to refuse, he‚Äôd look petty and unreasonable.

1gznjxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/1gznjxo/what_makes_someone_an_incel/,What Makes Someone an Incel?,"Hey everyone, hoping to have a nice civil discussion about this here.

  
My wife studies psychology, and we have been discussing the topic of incels recently, as we both find it fascinating. I've noticed the term ""incel"" being used increasingly more, both online and in person, and I'm starting to think the public perception of what makes someone an incel is becoming skewed. For example, this is very similar to how the general perception of the term ""OCD"" differs greatly from what OCD truly is, especially with how loosely it's thrown around in conversation despite it being a rare condition.  
We've come to the consensus of what makes someone truly an incel, and I'd like to see if you all here agree or not. Please share your opinions as well.  
I believe that for someone to be an incel, there is a formula of four specific behaviors and mindsets that must exist simultaneously. Someone can have one or more of these behaviors, but if not all four of them are present, then that person isn't an incel. Here is the list of the four criteria:

1. **Physically anti-social tendencies** ‚Äì This is specifically referring to socializing with people in person. Online relationships and communities do not count towards this. Essentially, a person voluntarily abstains from public socialization. This could be anything from group-based socialization like playing sports, participating in social clubs/groups, to more personal socialization like hanging out with a friend at a coffee shop or bookstore. In turn, these individuals turn to online forms of socialization and may even show signs of being ‚Äúchronically online.‚Äù
2. **Objectification and Over-Sexualization of Women** ‚Äì This one is straightforward. It typically (but not always) stems from overconsumption/addiction to pornography. This leads men to view women more as objects or prizes. It also develops extremely unrealistic expectations of what to expect from a sexual relationship. This can make it difficult for the individual to socialize normally with women without sexualizing them, which in turn further pushes them to have anti-social tendencies. I think a lot of confusion happens here. Some incels may effortlessly communicate with other men while struggling to communicate in a similar way with women, leading to discrepancies in how a person is perceived publicly.
3. **Narcissistic tendencies combined with a ‚Äúself-pity‚Äù mindset** ‚Äì This is arguably the defining characteristic of incels. What you have is someone who thinks that there is nothing about themselves that they need to change, while also speaking ill of themselves. We all know that being a positive, confident, open-minded person who has passions and hobbies is likely to attract others. We all also know that the opposite of that ‚Äî someone who is negative, insecure, close-minded, and lacks interest in anything ‚Äî is going to push people away. Incels are unique in that they have the latter mindset but do not believe it to be a problem, while simultaneously wallowing in the dread and self-pity of their situation.
4. **Lack of accountability for one‚Äôs situation** ‚Äì We all know that the first step to solving a problem is acknowledging that it exists. Incels understand that they struggle to communicate and pursue substantial relationships with women, especially romantic ones, and this frustrates them greatly. However, instead of understanding that they need to change things about their behavior and character to find success in developing relationships with women, they instead put blame onto society, often assigning hatred and blame to women instead. Additionally, we see blame assigned to non-controllable features such as height, facial structure, genital size, hairline, and other physical features to make the problem seem ‚Äúunsolvable.‚Äù I‚Äôve also noticed that incels will seek refuge in online communities with other incels, which serves as a sort of echo chamber that only reinforces the mindset that they themselves aren‚Äôt to blame for their lack of success with the opposite sex.

Not the kind of loneliness where you feel a little off for a day. I‚Äôm talking about the kind that creeps into your life slowly. The kind where you realize you‚Äôre seeing your friends less, spending less time with loved ones, and swapping real connection for likes, notifications, and incredibly imbalanced parasocial relationships.¬†

The¬†physical health consequences¬†of poor or insufficient connection include a 29% increased risk of heart disease, a 32% increased risk of stroke, and a 50% increased risk of developing dementia for older adults. Additionally, lacking social connection increases risk of premature death by more than 60%.

And the data from Jonathan Haidt‚Äôs,¬†The Anxious Generation¬†(incredible book) backs it up.¬†

Back in 1980s, nearly half of high school seniors were meeting up with their friends every day. These numbers held fairly constant throughout the next 20 years.

But something dramatic happened towards the end of the 2000s.¬†

2010 marked the moment when smartphones truly took hold. The App Store was in full swing, and social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter were starting to explode. Suddenly, it became easier (and more addictive) to connect online than to make plans in person.

By 2020? That number dropped to just 28% for females and 31% for males. And it‚Äôs not just teens‚Äîacross all age groups, the time people spend with friends has been tanking. We‚Äôre hanging out less, forming fewer close connections, and it‚Äôs starting to show.

A small-cap company transforms the coffee industry with compostable pods and sustainable packaging solutions.

https://preview.redd.it/hvtd5kfcv23e1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f141aa0dfe68fac6fabddba4afa5b2219c343fe7

If you‚Äôre someone who loves coffee, believes in sustainable choices, and sees the potential in smart investments, then **NEXE Innovations** should be on your radar. This small-cap company is transforming the coffee industry by tackling one of the sector's biggest environmental problems: waste from single-use coffee pods. Let's dive into why NEXE Innovations is on track to succeed with its sustainable coffee pod solution and the impressive steps it's taken to lead in eco-friendly packaging.

**A Big Idea Meets Market Demand**

NEXE Innovations launched with a powerful vision: create a fully compostable coffee pod to reduce plastic waste in the coffee industry. Unlike traditional coffee pods that linger in landfills for years, NEXE‚Äôs pods are designed to break down in as little as 17 days. The market response to this eco-conscious approach has been strong. When NEXE debuted on the TSX Venture Exchange in December 2020, the stock surged, reaching an all-time high of $5.90 within months. However, the rapid rise was followed by a pullback as the company worked on perfecting its product and production capabilities.

**Production Milestone: The Windsor Facility**

A major turnaround for NEXE Innovations began with the completion of its 54,000-square-foot production facility in Windsor, Ontario. This state-of-the-art facility, fully operational as of April 2023, enables NEXE to produce up to 500 million compostable pods annually. By centralizing production here, NEXE can scale efficiently while keeping costs under control.

The Windsor facility also enables NEXE to explore private label and co-manufacturing opportunities, allowing it to produce compostable pods for established coffee brands rather than competing with them. This approach opens doors to partnerships with industry giants, increasing NEXE‚Äôs visibility and reach in the market.

**Product Breakthroughs and Certification**

NEXE has refined its coffee pod formula, which initially composted within 35 days. Now, thanks to ongoing R&D, the company has cut that timeframe to just 17 days, making it one of the most rapidly composting coffee pods available. The product‚Äôs environmental credentials are further bolstered by BPI Certification from the Biodegradable Products Institute, ensuring that the pods meet stringent compostability standards. This certification strengthens NEXE‚Äôs appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and provides credibility in the competitive compostable packaging space.

**Diversifying the Product Line for Long-Term Growth**

1gznast,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1gznast/the_miracle_of_a_child/,The Miracle of a Child.,"Recently my wife has been trying to come up baby names for our little girl that will be born soon.

She has always had a fascination with Mythology and has always expressed interest in picking a name based on a strong Mythological character.

As we quickly approach the due date this has been her top priority.

She has these running lists all over the house, crossing names out, ranking the current choices, etc.

Up until now I was not involved heavily in making the top contender list because I did not want to get in the middle of it - just let her do her thing.

I have been very busy preparing the new nursery - I hand built a crib from a diagram used to make the same one generations of fathers in my family have constructed. I have spent weeks working on this and it was finally done, this distracted me more than I should have been - maybe I should have tried to be more involved.

I was pouring myself some coffee before I go to work for the day, when my world would come crashing down.

My wife came downstairs and was elated, saying she finally has THE name picked out: *""Ishtar!""*

My body lost all rigidity and I could feel the coffee cup slip out of my hand, the scalding contents crashing down on the floor and splattering all over my bare feet.

I did not flinch from the pain, because the pain in my heart was so overwhelming.

*""W..ww.aa...""* i could not even stammer out a response.

My wife was too excited to even notice the coffee falling and boiling my feet.

*""ISHTAR! Isn't it amazing? As the goddess of war, she is often shown winged and bearing arms! Such a POWERFUL image and name for our little girl, she will rule the world one day!""*

My wife started to closely pay attention to my facial expressions and started to lean in slowly to hear my mumbling.

*""She wil...wil...will not...be..*...*""*

*""Honey are you okay, what are you mumbling?""*

I had to plant my closed fist down on the kitchen island to steady myself, both vertically and verbally.

*"".....mm.....my daughter will NOT BE A BOT!""* I exclaimed.

*""...a Bot? What are you talking about?*

I went into full blown Charlie Kelly style rant, but instead of Pepe-Silvia and drawing connections to conspiracies of a fake person and the federal mail service, I was taking about something Real.

*""My daughter will not be some Haven-spinning Bot. I won't have it!""*

I started hobbling around the island, encircling my confused wife.

*""There has to be another name on the list to pick from!""*

At this point all I see is the green hue of the hull as my vision begins to blurr in and out.

*""Oh honey, does this have to do with that game you pla..""*

I cut her off -

*""ITS NOT JUST A GAME!""*

*""Baby please, after months of searching for the perfect name I found one. Besides, no one will think she is a bot! You are so silly! The rats auto target the drones now...""*

*""THAT WAS NOT AN INTENTIONAL CHANGE TO THE GAME!""*

My fury of emotions was starting to be overtaken by the massive hull damage my feet endured from the scalding hot coffee, I collapse to the floor cradling my stumps.

The thoughts rushing through my mind: Bots in Havens, Sentry drones in Pochven, my head felt like it was drowning.

My wife knelt beside me, gently grabbing my shoulder.

*""OKAY FINE Honey, my goodness you are so dramatic. If its going to be that big of a problem we can go to my number two choice.""*

The wave of relief crashed over me - crisis averted.

My wife called an ambulance to come pick me up so I could be taken to the hospital for my burns. The crew put me on the stretcher and carried me outside, my wife followed.

As they loaded me inside the back of the ambulance my wife stood in the driveway looking at me repeating *""its all going to be okay.""*

The ambulance crew was getting ready to depart, as they were about to close the doors I looked towards my wife -

*""What was the second choice for the name?""*

*""Phoebe.""*

As the doors to the ambulance closed my vision became blurry, I could see a small jump fatigue icon starting to glow in the upper left part of my vision.

The doors to the ambulance may have closed shut, but my mouth did not from my deep guttural screams.",25,1732553137.0,Eve,12,0.83,False

Me (30M) moved to a different country about 2 and a half years ago, been working in different jobs as a bar tender where I met my friend (28F) that she moved from another country too.
Both of us went through hard relationships and we gave each other advice and support even after breaking up with our respectives ""partners"".

We've been good friends and since we found ourselves in the same affective status, I tried my shot with her expressing my feelings towards her, but she bounced back basically saying that she'd prefer to stay as friends, wich I could deal with the rejection and accept the friendship, in the end she's on of the few that were true friends.

Years passed, she found a job in a pharmaceutical company in the supply department while I stood in the bar trade. We lost contact for about 3 months, in the mean time, I started a relationship with my current girlfriend. 
My friend contacted me again, I told her about my girlfriend and we accorded a day to go for lunch the 3 of us.
During this lunch she told us that she's been dating the HR guy from her company for about the same time she lost contact.
This guy is still living with his ex wife and the kid all in a same house, and has been telling my friend that's planning to move somewhere else so they can move with my friend together (it's been 10 months ever since this).

Fast forward in time, my friend tells me about a new position in the business planning apartment of the company she works. I deliver my cv and get an interview with the manager and my friend's boyfriend, the interview lasted and hour through videocall, talking about my past experiences in the area. On the other hand, my friend has been recommending me and doing her inside job in order that I had an extra chance to be selected.
A week after I get a feedback from the HR guy about my interview saying why I didn't got selected. And endless stream of pure A grade bullshit. Addressing to me as my nickname wich I never gave to him, saying that I didn't understood what the role was about (wich is werid because the position was for a trainee) etc etc etc etc.
On the same day I meet with my friend for coffee, and talked for hours and hours and she never touched the subject or asked about my interview. When I mentioned it, I could see the distress on her eyes saying that she knew about it, saying that she was told that I was too close to be picked for the role, but the person that got the job was so qualified for it. And, in some way, that gave me some consolation to think that I lost to the best.
Fast forward to 4 days ago, I call my friend to catch up with her, and immediately she starts talking about the person that got hired instead of me saying and I quote: ""It's the most useless cunt that I've ever had to share a workspace with"". 
I got furious, my suspects were true, I didn't got picked because of a personal thing rather than under qualifying for the role. All thanks to this possessive piece of shit that thinks that I'm trying to steal his girlfriend, because that's exactly what he would do.
I haven't spoken to my friend ever since and she hasn't tried to reach me, but when she does, I'll tell her how I feel about her partner and my absolute disapproval towards him and her relationship.

I know and I understand that it's not my friend's fault that I didn't got picked since she did all she could do to help me and give me a hand to find a better job. But unfortunately she has a record of dating and relating to absolute toxic people.

She's not a bad girl, she just humps the wrong dick.

Lorsque tu installes une appli d√©di√©e √† la mod√©ration de la plateforme de d√©veloppement, de nouvelles options de menu peuvent devenir disponibles pour l‚Äôensemble de ton √©quipe de mod√©ration, alors n‚Äôoublie pas de discuter de ces installations avec tout le monde au pr√©alable. Ces options peuvent parfois se trouver en cliquant sur le bouton du bouclier de mod√©ration, puis en faisant d√©filer l‚Äô√©cran vers le bas.¬†¬†

Selon l‚Äôappli install√©e, des options de configuration peuvent appara√Ætre. Lis-les bien et prends le temps de les adapter aux besoins sp√©cifiques de ton √©quipe. Tu peux √©galement tester d‚Äôabord une appli dans un subreddit de test.

Enfin, l‚Äôinstallation d‚Äôune appli ajoutera automatiquement un compte de mod√©ration √† ta communaut√©. Pas d‚Äôinqui√©tude, il n‚Äôest pas g√©r√© par un √™tre humain, mais constitue une partie de ce qui permet √† ces applis de fonctionner sur ton subreddit. Tu auras besoin de permissions de modo compl√®tes pour installer une appli.

**Quatre applis d‚Äôoutils de mod√©ration populaires et faciles √† configurer**¬†

1. [Comment Mop](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/comment-nuke) en bref¬†: couper et dompter facilement les fils de commentaires¬†

Un fil de commentaire a fait d√©vier une conversation vers un territoire min√©¬†? Ou dure depuis trop longtemps¬†? Si tu souhaites supprimer ou verrouiller un commentaire parent et tous les commentaires qui en d√©coulent, cette appli t‚Äôaide √† y parvenir en quelques clics¬†!¬†

Lorsque tu supprimes du contenu de cette fa√ßon, fais tr√®s attention, car tu ne liras probablement pas toute la liste des commentaires supprim√©s. Les membres ne verront pas les motifs de retrait et t‚Äô√©criront peut-√™tre pour savoir ce qui n‚Äôallait pas. Il peut √™tre utile de laisser un seul motif de retrait dans le commentaire parent expliquant pourquoi tout a disparu.

2. [Remove Macro](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/purge-user) en bref¬†: supprimer tout le contenu d‚Äôun membre avec une potentielle exclusion en un claquement de doigts

Les modos ne peuvent pas tout voir, et tu peux d√©couvrir un membre dont le contenu enfreint les r√®gles et passe depuis longtemps sous les radars. Avec cette appli, tout supprimer manuellement devient *easy peasy*.

Cette appli est tr√®s puissante et n√©cessite √©galement beaucoup de prudence. En supprimant une grande quantit√© de contenu en bloc, tu risques de priver ta communaut√© d‚Äôun contenu de grande valeur. Il sera √©galement pratiquement impossible de r√©approuver tous les contenus supprim√©s si tu d√©cides de revenir sur cette d√©cision. Elle te permet √©galement d‚Äôexclure le ou la membre dans le cadre du processus.

T‚Äôes-tu d√©j√† dit¬†: ¬´¬†Nous recevons trop de mod mails sur les m√™mes sujets¬†¬ª¬†? Une simple configuration de r√®gles peut t‚Äôaider. [La configuration par d√©faut propos√©e dans le wiki ModMail Automoderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/fsvapps/wiki/auto-modmail/#wiki_responding_to_ban_appeals_from_users_who_aren.27t_banned.) est un bon point de d√©part.¬†

Au moment de cr√©er ces automatisations, garde en m√©moire tes objectifs. Si un¬∑e redditor ne comprend pas ce qu‚Äôil se passe, tu risques de t‚Äôengager dans des conversations encore plus longues, ce qui va √† l‚Äôencontre de l‚Äôobjectif premier de l‚Äôautomatisation.

Il est important de se rappeler comment les redditors percevront ces messages. Certains messages automatis√©s, comme un premier message rappelant aux membres ton temps de r√©ponse, peuvent am√©liorer l‚Äôexp√©rience des redditors. D‚Äôautres peuvent les frustrer et aggraver la situation. V√©rifie comment tes r√©ponses sont re√ßues avant de configurer l‚Äôarchivage automatique.

4. [Flair Assistant](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/flairassistant) en bref¬†: ex√©cuter des actions (verrouillage, exclusion, envoi de messages, ignorance et autres) automatiquement en attribuant un flair √† une publication.

Qui n‚Äôaime pas pouvoir effectuer des actions avanc√©es en deux clics¬†?

Flair Assistant te permet de d√©clencher de nombreuses actions facultatives diff√©rentes en appliquant simplement le flair de publication. Parmi ces actions, on retrouve¬†: l‚Äôapprobation, le retrait (avec motif de retrait), le spam, l‚Äôignorance des signalements, le verrouillage, l‚Äôexclusion de membre, le commentaire, la modification du flair de membre ou de publication, ou encore l‚ÄôAjout d‚Äôune note de mod√©ration.

Apr√®s l‚Äôavoir configur√©, toute ton √©quipe pourra effectuer des actions de mod√©ration plus rapidement. Il peut faire des merveilles si tu prends le temps de le configurer correctement.¬†

When you install a developer platform app that is mod-facing, new menu options may become available to your entire mod team, so be sure to discuss these installations with your team first. These can sometimes be found in the mod shield button and then scrolling down.¬†¬†

Depending on the app you install, you may have configuration options appear. Read them well and take your time adjusting it to your team‚Äôs specific needs. You may also want to test out an app in a test subreddit first.

Lastly, installing an app will add a mod account to your community automatically. Don‚Äôt worry, these are not human, but part of what makes these apps work on your subreddit. You will need full moderator permissions to install an app.

# Four Popular Mod Tool Apps That Are Easy to Set Up¬†

1. [**Comment Mop**](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/comment-nuke) TLDR: Trim and tame comment branches easily¬†

Has a comment branch derailed a conversation into unwanted territory? Or has one gone on for way too long? If you want to remove or lock a parent comment and all of the comments under it, this app helps you do so in a few clicks!¬†

When removing content this way, be very careful since you will likely not be reading the entire list of removed comments. Users will not see Removal Reasons and may write to you wondering what they did wrong. It may help to leave a single removal reason in the parent comment explaining the removal.

1. [**Remove Macro**](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/purge-user) TLDR: Remove all content from a user with an optional ban in 2 clicks

Mods can‚Äôt see everything, and you may discover a user that has a long history of rule-breaking content that made it past your radar. Removing it all manually can be a breeze with this app!

This app is very powerful and also requires a lot of care. Removing so much content in bulk can remove some very valuable content from your community. It will also make it near impossible to re-approve all the removed content if you decide to reverse this action.

Have you ever thought to yourself: ‚ÄúWe get too many incoming Mod Mail messages about the same topics?‚Äù A simple rule configuration can help. The [default suggested in the ModMail Automoderator wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/fsvapps/wiki/auto-modmail/#wiki_responding_to_ban_appeals_from_users_who_aren.27t_banned.) is helpful as a starting point.¬†

Don‚Äôt forget your goals when creating these automations. If a redditor is confused, you may be setting yourselves up to even longer conversations, defeating the purpose of the automation in the first place.

It‚Äôs important to remember how redditors will perceive these messages. Some automated messages, like an initial one reminding users of your response times, can make redditors have a better experience. Others can frustrate them and escalate a situation. Review how your responses are received before setting up auto-archiving.

Nothing out of the ordinary. When I went to check on it, I noticed the pot half full, no light on the Moccamaster, and sort of a ""burn"" smell. Not burnt coffee. Like a small fire had happened.

I assume it's some kind of short in the unit.

The unit is about a year old. We usually make one pot per day. Sometimes two. I have no idea what could have happened.

I haven't started digging at all into docs or warranty info. Figured I'd check here first. I'm fairly handy in the DIY department, so if there were obvious things to look at, I would prefer to do that vs trying to figure out warranty procedures. At the same time, I don't want to take it apart and possibly void the warranty.

I changed the portafilter basket a couple years in (sorry I'm still not confident on all the terms!)  
  
But it's only within the last year or so I've started giving my coffee making at home some proper attention. I started buying whole beans from a local roaster, which lead to me getting a Hario hand grinder and more recently a WDT tool. I'm lacking a decent set of scales though.  
  
I'm really enjoying the process; there's something therapeutic about it. But even though I'm only grinding for myself, doing it by hand is a pain! And so that's one of the main reasons I'm looking to upgrade what I have.   
  
As much as I'd like to think I'm becoming James Hoffman, if I'm honest I'm probably not that involved and probably won't get to that stage. I just want to make what I enjoy, not go winning competitions! So although I understand the benefits of a machine like a Gaggia Classic, in terms of longevity etc., I'm not confident I'm technically minded, or proactive enough to make full use of the capabilities of that sort of machine.   
  
So at the moment my mind is currently hovering around the Sage (Breville) Barista Express Impress. It seems to have enough automation to make making a nice coffee on a busy weekday morning easy. But also has the opportunity to play around with it, and dial it in more, at the weekends.   
  
But is it worth the extra money over the Barista Express? Would that be just as easy to use, with a decent set of scales, whilst trying to monitor a 3yo? Are there any similar alternatives, with an in-built grinder\*, out there I'm missing out on?   


Thanks in advance for any suggestions - Looking to spend under ¬£800, obviously lower/better cost effectiveness is better!

If you‚Äôre overthinking and trying to come up with the perfect business idea, you are doing it all wrong. Let me explain why. Good ideas don‚Äôt come from staring at a blank screen waiting for inspiration to hit like lightning.

And the ones who consistently hit it big like Elon musk. They have a system for finding new ideas that actually work. And today, I‚Äôm handing you those tools which you can use.

Here are 2 techniques which can work for you guys:  
  
1. Solve a real problem people Complain About

Where do you find problems? Everywhere. Pay attention to what people complain about:  
Maybe scroll through reddit threads or read the 1-star reviews on Amazon.

2. Also sometimes stealing a winning Idea but doing It smartly

For example, take an idea that‚Äôs already working somewhere else and make it better. Maybe look at what‚Äôs booming in another city, country, or industry. Add a twist. Simplify it. Niche it down. Examples? Uber didn‚Äôt invent taxis. Starbucks didn‚Äôt invent coffee. They just did it better.

Also spend some time checking Facebook groups, forums, or TikTok trends.

**Queue**

Still got a 10 - 20 minutes queue for Acropolis Museum, Ancient Agora and National Archeological Museum if you arrive in the afternoon. 

**Food** 

Tylixto Greek Wrap. Kostas should be one of the famous one. But I didn't manage to try that since it close in the evening. Instead, I have tried Tylixto Greek Wrap. It's great and close at midnight.

Mavros Gatos. Traditional tavern with reasonable price. It offers pastitsio too! 

**Coffee**

Apart from those famous ones, I've tried these less mentioned which surprise me. 

Tailor Made Coffee Roasters. They got outdoor seats and tables, offering pastries and traditional pies. I tried a pie which is good. White coffee is balanced and smooth.

A Tot. A takeaway tiny coffee shop. Only got a small bench right outside the shop. One of the best flat white I had in Athens.   

4m (Rule of 4m). Close to Panathenaic Stadium. ‚Ç¨2 for a high quality flat white. I was a bit shock when I paid cause a flat white normally costs over ‚Ç¨3 in central Athens. But the quality is better than most other coffee shops I've tried in Athens. 

**Day Trip**

I made two separate day trips from Athens to Meteora and Delphi respectively. Definitely a must go. The tour guides of both trips are very professional and passionate. I've joined day tours in different countries. These two guides (although from different companies) are 'crazily' passionate and knowledgeable. Super positive vibe. Love that!

Meteora. Highly recommended Meteora thrones - travel center. Seems better to include lunch as well as it's more expensive to buy the meal on spot. But if you just want a pie, then you don't need to include the lunch option. 

Delphi. Key Tours. A more scaled tour center. They got a very responsive customer service. Reminder communication right before the trip. The last coffee stop on return got a lot of traditional pastry/food. But sadly I was full already, couldn't eat more.

Spoiler: It‚Äôs Complicated, But Here‚Äôs How to Make It Work","They say money can‚Äôt buy happiness ‚Äî but let‚Äôs be real, it sure doesn‚Äôt hurt. From paying the bills to splurging on experiences, money plays a massive role in our lives. The big question is, how much money do you need to stop worrying about it and start enjoying life? That‚Äôs exactly what two Nobel laureates, Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton, tackled in their groundbreaking 2010 study. Their findings rocked the financial and psychological world, and since then, new research has taken the conversation even further.

[*Follow MaxDividends! Don‚Äôt miss out on fresh dividend stock picks and insights!*](https://www.maxdividends.com/)

So, how does money relate to happiness, and how can you make your dollars work harder at delivering those feel-good vibes? Let‚Äôs break it down.

**The Magic Number: $75,000‚Ä¶ or Is It?**

In 2010, Kahneman and Deaton analyzed data from 450,000 Americans to figure out how income impacts happiness. Here‚Äôs what they found:

* Emotional well-being improves with income, but only up to¬†**$75,000 a year**¬†(adjusted for inflation, that‚Äôs about $100,000 in 2024 dollars).
* Beyond that, additional income doesn‚Äôt significantly boost happiness ‚Äî at least, not in a linear way.

The key word here is ‚Äúlinear.‚Äù Emotional satisfaction increases more slowly as income grows, eventually plateauing. This led to the now-famous idea that¬†**money buys happiness only up to a certain point.**

**2021 Update: More Money, More Happiness (Sometimes)**

In 2021, researcher Matthew Killingsworth revisited this question with a fresh approach. Instead of asking people how they¬†*generally*¬†feel about life, he created a smartphone app that prompted participants to report their current mood throughout the day. The results?

* Happiness doesn‚Äôt necessarily plateau at $75,000 ‚Äî it keeps climbing for some people.
* However, the catch is¬†**how you value and use money.**¬†If you‚Äôre all about material things, the joy from extra cash fizzles out faster.

Killingsworth‚Äôs findings confirmed that it‚Äôs not just about how much you make but how you¬†*spend*¬†it. Money isn‚Äôt a golden ticket to happiness unless you know how to play the game.

**The Happiness Playbook: 8 Rules for Spending Wisely**

If you‚Äôre ready to squeeze maximum joy out of your hard-earned dollars, here are eight evidence-backed strategies that will help you make every penny count:

1. **Buy Experiences, Not Stuff**¬†Trips, concerts, or even a cooking class often bring more lasting happiness than a new gadget or designer shoes. Why? Experiences create memories, and memories are priceless.
2. **Go Small and Frequent**¬†Splitting your budget into smaller indulgences (like fancy coffee or weekend getaways) brings more joy than blowing it all on one big-ticket item.
3. **Skip the Extended Warranties**¬†Those add-ons retailers push are usually a waste. Save the money and use it for something that will actually make you happy.
4. **Pay Now, Enjoy Later**¬†The anticipation of a future experience (like a vacation) often brings just as much happiness as the event itself. Paying upfront removes financial stress, leaving only the good vibes.
5. **Think About Impact, Not Features**¬†Will a newer car or a bigger house¬†*really*¬†make your day-to-day life better? Focus on how purchases improve your routine, not just how shiny they look.
6. **Avoid the Comparison Trap**¬†Keeping up with the Joneses is a surefire way to kill your joy. Measure happiness by your own standards, not someone else‚Äôs Instagram highlight reel.
7. **Pay Attention to Others‚Äô Happiness**¬†Seeing how your spending decisions impact others (in a positive way) can amplify your own sense of fulfillment.
8. **Spend on Others**¬†Here‚Äôs the ultimate happiness hack: give your money away. Studies show that spending on others, whether through gifts or charity, brings more joy than spending on yourself.

**Giving: The Shortcut to Happiness**

Speaking of spending on others, there‚Äôs plenty of science to back it up. One study found that participants who were given money and told to spend it on others reported greater happiness than those who spent it on themselves.

This isn‚Äôt just a feel-good story ‚Äî it‚Äôs a practical approach to happiness. Whether it‚Äôs donating to a cause or surprising a friend with a thoughtful gift, giving opens the door to deeper connections and a sense of purpose.

**The Bottom Line: Happiness Is in Your Hands**

Money alone won‚Äôt make you happy, but it‚Äôs a powerful tool when used wisely. Focus on experiences, avoid the temptation to splurge on material things, and don‚Äôt underestimate the joy of giving. Whether you‚Äôre making $50,000 or $500,000, the way you spend your dollars matters more than the number in your bank account.

As the holidays approach, let‚Äôs use this as a reminder to spread some happiness ‚Äî not just to ourselves but to those around us. Because at the end of the day, the greatest wealth isn‚Äôt in what you have, but in the joy you create.

Deforestation is an environmental threat not even in Cuba alone but also worldwide. The effects that it causes are always in one way or another felt by the farthest of the States in the entire universe. To this effect, this paper addresses the impact of deforestation in Cuba and the solutions available to manage the impacts.

The political shifting dynamics of Cuba influenced the countries environmental aspects. The different political eras brought about great impacts to its natural resources. The changes in political dispensations in Cuba immensely influenced the environmental management of the natural resources throughout the Cuban development as a country.

Over the three political eras, which include Neo-colonialism influenced by the United States, the Revolutionary era followed closely by the coming of the Soviet Union communist regime, deforestation has been a major concern. Currently, the Special Period also has had great impact on the environment‚Äôs management of the natural resource. Cuba was known for its forestry cover that deteriorated with time.

Forests are very essential in the regulation of the climate and maintenance of the biosphere integrity. Forests are beneficial to humans in many different ways. For instance, they are an important source of timber and food. Additionally, some of the plants found within forests have a medicinal value.

They also provide good sports for recreational activities. The richness in ecosystem led to deforestation of the Cuban ecosystem. Research has shown that deforestation plays a great role in increasing anthropogenic carbon emissions. This is detrimental even to the human health in Cuba and its environs.

## Causes of deforestation

One of the most significant aspects during the political eras in the nation that characterized the political development was the fluctuation in deforestation. Rudel (1994) notes ‚Äúthere is a socio-economic connection as far as deforestation is concerned. This is so because as the increase in the living standards leads to equal increase in the consumption of forest products‚Äù (p. 7).

The political dispensations as well as the socio-economic structures in Cuba were always significant in the management of the Cuban environment. This, in return, led to great destructions of the forest cover.

From the beginning of the 20th century, Giraldo (2007) says, ‚ÄúCuba has experienced great improvement in the management of its environment demonstrating a vast improvement in the socio-economic situation of the country‚Äù (p. 98).

According to Hornborg, McNeill, and Martinez-Alier (2007), the connection between the environmental changes and the societal processes defined the political ecosystem that Cuba has gone through during the three political eras (p. 87). Cuba is among the best islands that one could ever want to live in though the Spaniard colonial landowners destroyed most of its natural resources.

They burned down forests and obtained from the ashes enough fertilizer to enhance the growth of the highly lucrative coffee trees. It was later that Cuba was transformed into a land that exported the largest number of sugar, tobacco and coffee. All of which was achieved through destruction of the forests to pave way for the monoculture agricultural venture.

According to the Government of Cuba, ‚Äúthe total forest cover fell from 89.2% in 1812 to 54% in 1900‚Äù (1993, p. 1). During the Spanish era, the forest cover fell by almost 35% due to the quest for timber. After the Spanish era, the United States took over bringing up an Amendment that ensured that they had the control over the Cuba‚Äôs natural resources.

This Platt Amendment caused the most deforestation. Cuba got involved with many countries for its sustainability that saw a lot of its economy get back on track. Later, Cuba was forced into self-reliance, which translated into over-reliance on agriculture leading to further deforestation to create more room for the venture. This led to destruction of water catchment areas, soil erosions among others.

The forests of Cuba under Spanish Colonization were seen as nothing more than ‚Äúlumber to build sugar mills, firewood to fuel them, and sources of stunningly fertile soil‚Äù (Monzote, 2008, p. 45). Additionally, the Spaniards used the forests to build their ships and lumber destined for Spain.

They had no respect for the country‚Äôs natural state. With time, the population increased and this caused the need to expand the agricultural sector to cater for foreign markets and its bloated population.

There was a decrease in timber production due to the increased human action to the forests. However, the increase in not only coffee but also sugar plantations helped to curb the extreme effects of deforestation in the nation.

## Its Impacts

The Cuba‚Äôs natural conditions revived in the nineteenth century and this led to the increase of deforestation to produce more sugarcane annually. The regeneration of the forest cover accounted for around 38 percent of the sugarcane production worldwide and around 25 percent of the total sugar supply (Hagelberg & Alverez, 2006, p. 24).

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Cuba exhibited a significant loss of its forest cover-38 percent. It was caused by the burning down of forests that occurred during the war that broke up that time. The social and political shift also led to deterioration of the forest ecosystem.

During the Neo-Colonialism, the United States managed everything and owned everything including the waters, the fertile lands for sugar cane production among others. It was during this period that degradation and deforestation was on the highest mark.

The merciless cutting down of trees to create more land for the sugar production was the benchmark in the Neo-colonial era. Additionally, exportation of wood and other forest products was very high. Moreover, charcoal, majorly used as the main source of cooking, destroyed the forests a great deal.

Deforestation in Cuba went a long way and many a time, the Cubans felt the need to reverse the situation though this was not possible then. There was a lot of foreign interference that hindered enactment of any conservatory law. It was in the year 1926 that President Machado approved the Decree 495 that prohibited any clearing of high woodlands whether private or government owned.

It was later enacted into law. Later on, the Revolution era brought about some equality as far as employment was concerned and improvements in education sector. The State took control over all the natural resources of the country and started saving forests and encouraging afforestation. Many policies were formed and the exportation of timber was banned.

When Castro got into power, he encouraged reforestation through construction of very many tree nurseries. However, poor education led to destruction of many seedlings. The forests cover nevertheless after training of the locals, increased by 5 percent. This increase in forest cover was because of the great management of timber harvest and reforestation.

Additionally, there was introduction of protected areas of forests with establishment of the first national park. The enactment of Law 33 enhanced the conservation of the protected areas. Houck (2000) says that, ‚Äúthe law outlines the rational use of natural resources pertaining to sustainable forest protection activities‚Äù (p. 56).

There were also establishment of legal frameworks pertaining environmental issues among which was the Law of Agrarian Reform. Additionally, there was the establishment of an advisory body called COMARNA that addressed forestry, fisheries among other areas. For every forest harvested, an equal quantity was planted.

The Special Period was majorly characterized by economic crisis that evolved by the Cuban State being dependent on itself for sustainability. During this period, there were no international ties whatsoever.

This led to the nation over depending on the forests for medicine, food, water and other needs eventually leading to more devastation to the forests. Deforestation surpassed afforestation efforts for people ended up depending on charcoal fully for fuel. Even so, there was a twenty-two percent increase in forest cover.

## Policies to manage the impact

Additionally, some trees became extinct because of their over-usage like their leaves being used as fillers for pillows and mattresses and their trucks for construction of houses. Nevertheless, Cuba continued enforcing more stringent laws and policies for environmental conservation.

Some Laws included the Law of the Environment that addressed air, water, pollution, forests among others. Another legislature was the Forestry Act that ensured that the forest cover was addressed as well as providing framework for wood species preservation.

## Conclusion

In order to satisfy the human needs in Cuba and the world at large, modification of the forest ecosystem was done. This coupled with the political interventions led to the destruction and construction of the Cuban forests. Cuba was known for its forest cover and many people depended on the forests for sustainability including non-citizens like during the Spaniard era where a lot of timber was transported to Spain.

It is clear that the population growth in the Cuban State brought about deforestation to create land for more arable farming than any other land use. However, the consequences of the farming brought about extensive deforestation and environmental damage (Williams, 2006, p. 32).

Later, colonialism and neo-colonialism aggravated the situation of deforestation. The situation worsened in the 1900 when the United States took ownership of the State managing everything including the people. It was until the State became sovereign managing all its resources without any interference from other countries that the forest cover got back on its feet again.

Forest management cropped up even in the education curriculums resulting into reforestation and even people started living as a community. Basic needs were provided that had demanded forest clearance like provision of alternative energies led to no more charcoal burning. Other agricultural techniques that demand lesser portion of land led to the conservation of the forests.

The improvement in environmental education that encouraged the central value of the forest ecosystems in Cuba, as well as the improvement in environmental law, policy-making and implementation led to sustainable forestry practices.

Additionally, deforestation, as an environmental concern with global effects, talks among the United Nations Forum on Forests have been conducted that will ensure a common forestry law.

The Law gives all the nations the freedom to maintain their forest cover and in case of a breach in the case, the Law allows punishment to the deviant nation accordingly. This will ensure that the countries that have great forest conservation techniques maintain the spirit because of their independence from political and social interference.
