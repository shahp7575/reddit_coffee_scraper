On a path out of Wuncleton, I met a tired looking man with the face of a hound and great hair. He saw me and offered me a cup of coffee. I shook my head. “Are you more of a tea guy? I used to know one of those,” he said, chuckling. I smiled shyly and left him behind. 

I wander I wander. In the foothills outside of Wuncleton, I heard an eerie voice. I looked around and heard it again. “Blocked,” the voice said. When I found the source of the voice, a mysterious specter huffed and disappeared into a burst of flower petals. I stepped on but felt the spirit’s eyes on my back. 

I wander I wander. By a river as sharp as steel, a song tickled my ear. The voices soft as silk, sweet as honey, and sorrowful, promised rest to a weary traveler like me. But beneath the melody, I sensed a hollow ache. A longing that could not be sated by comfort or affection. They reached towards me, their hands gentle but giving the sense of a false covenant. I stepped back and returned to my lonely path. 

I wander I wander. My experiences clung to me like dust to my coat. Still I continued, knowing I have not found what I am looking for.",1,1765249744.0,DemocracyOfReddit,0,1.0,False

Her office will be close to water place and center place.  Ideally would be nice to find a walkable place for her that would make to and from work easy and safe. More restaurants coffee shops near her the best but just want safest place possible-while also interesting. She is a bit anxious knowing nothing about the area and deciding if job and area a good fit- she will be there a couple days later this week and didn’t know if you all could recommend places you think would be most fun and safe for 24 yo finance person. It looks like a quaint town! She is currently in Charlotte and it has been a violent hellhole lately although it could be great if ran well. Hoping providence can make it interesting but less people shot near where she lives. Are there special businesses that rent condos or 1 bedroom places?

Interview With The Sandman
(A reimagining of Jeff The Killer by Sessuer‘s and GameFuelTv’s)

	He tapped his hand in a rhythmic pattern. The same two taps, then a pause. Three, pause, then two again. He sat, cuffs pinning him to the table, face covered in sparse strands of long dark hair. A line of drool had been flowing from his obscured mouth, collecting on the cold metal, before unceremoniously dripping onto the floor. He breathed slowly, wheezing, like he had smoked since birth. In, hollow. Out, raspy. 

	Detective Simmons stood on the other side of a one-way mirror, watching him. Taking one hand to rub his eyes, he sighed deeply,  then trailed his fingers down to smooth out his mustache. He was a portly man in his 40s, ginger hair covered by a brimmed police hat, tired eyes that never seemed to blink. He stood, slouching slightly, before jumping at the sound of the door opening. 

	“Oh shi-, sorry sir!” Andy yelled into the room as he entered, “I brought the coffee.”

	Andy was a younger man, with a heavily freckled face, framed by curly brown hair that fell on either side of his face. 

	“Jus- just put it on the table, Richards.” Simmons wearily replied, before returning his gaze to the glass. Gingerly, Andy set the cheap disposable cups on the table behind Simmons. He went to stand beside Simmons, his unprofessional hoodie swaying as he turned, as his badge haphazardly hung from his belt.

	For a moment he stood in silence, staring along with Simmons. The silence almost seemed loud, like the air itself whispered underneath each exhale.They stood, watching the man behind the glass, before Andy broke the stillness, coughing aloud.

	“So, who’s he?”

	Simmons didn’t take his eyes off the glass, “He’s an old case - Jeffery Woods. About 20 years back he committed triple homicide on his family, burned their house down, and then three more killed after that.”
	
	Andy broke his gaze to look at Simmons. “So why’s he here then? Isn’t the case solved? Day saved and all that?”

“It might not be,” Simmons replied, “there’s been a new string of murders, all the same M.O.; throat sliced open, with the mouth carved as well.” He rubbed his eye again, still seemingly never having blinked.

“So, a copycat killer?”

“Nah, can’t be,” Simmons sighed. 

“What do you mean?”

“Can’t be, the deaths are too similar. Some of the details that weren't released have been mimicked.” Simmons broke his gaze from the glass for a moment, looking at Andy,  “The witnesses also give a description that’s the same as our guy here.”

“Y’know,” Andy started, laughing under his breath, “seeing him now, he doesn’t look as scary as I thought. Kids used to tell plenty of stories about him.”

“Ugh,” Simmons grunted, turning his head back, “not the sorta thing a kid should be hearin’ about.”

“Well some have tvs playing while parents don’t pay attention,” Andy began, a hint of excitement in his voice. “They hear the news of some killer, and are fascinated with it. Before you know it they’re sharing with other kids, who also share it, and boom - new neighborhood boogeyman.”

“Personal experience, Richards?”  Simmons mumbled, barely trying to be heard.

“Heh, you could say that. We called him ‘Jeff The Killer’. Dumb name looking back on it.” 

As Andy finished, Simmons turned to the table, grabbing his coffee.

“We’re gonna keep this simple, by the books. Don’t let on that someone’s out there killing people. Less he knows, less he’ll hide. Got that?”

Andy raised his hand in a mock salute. “Aye aye o’ captain my captain.”

Simmons grumbled, shaking his head as he reached for his radio.

“Cooper, this is Simmons. We’re ready to begin.”

*
Andy and Simmons sat opposite of him. He didn’t acknowledge their entrance, and just kept tapping on the table. Closer up you could see his breath push his hair forward slightly. He had brought it forward, trying to cover all of his face, though it made the rest of his balding head more obvious. His chest heaved, every breath a focused effort. 

Simmons was the first to speak. 

“Jeffery Woods, I’m detective Simmons, and this is officer Richards.” He spoke clearly, calmly. Like a parent speaking to a young child, not wanting to startle or upset them. 

He continued, ”We just want to ask you a few questions, can you do that?” 
	
All at once, Jeff stopped tapping. His breathing was silent, as he sat up in his chair. His hair fell to either side of his face, like curtains revealing a stage. Rather than a fantastical set piece, a pale, burned face was unveiled. 

He was disgusting, there was no way around it. His skin was pale, almost white, with healed burns framing parts of his face. His mouth was filled with stained yellow teeth, crooked with rotten gums, all clearly visible from his cut mouth and shriveled lips. His slashed mouth was stitched, though many of them had torn and hung loose from the scars. His right eye was a pale brown, the other was long blinded, cocked far to the left. He had no nose, it was long gone. In its place were just two small holes he wheezily breathed from.  He smiled, always. It was hard to tell if it was just his carved face or if he consciously grinned at all times; maybe it was both. 

“I remember you,” he spoke. His voice was gravelly, raspy, like sandpaper across your ears. 

“Yes, I interviewed you a long time ago now,” Simmons said, “we just want to ask you a few questions.”

Jeff cocked his head to the side, staring into Andy. He jumped once his eyes fell on him, and Jeff said, “You’re new… different.”

“Uh, ye- yeah,” Andy replied, almost shaking, “I’m, I'm new.”

Jeff stared for a moment, before turning his head back to Simmons, his neck audibly cracking. His eyes widened, mouth stretching, as he spoke.

“Ask away, Gerald.”

“Please Jeff,” Simmons sighed, looking down at the table for a moment, “Just call me Simmons.”

Jeff just continued to stare at him for a moment, his eye ever so slightly twitching. Simmons looked up, before opening a manilla folder previously under his arm. 

“You remember your mother, right Jeff?”

“Oh yes, I remember,” he began, his voice creaky, almost cooing. “She was just a doll. Kind, calm, but stern. Always worried about her boys, but never enough to do anything for them.”

He gestured at his face, or, at least he tried to with his restricted hands. 

“I still remember when she first saw… this. She was so scared, a great wailing mess.”

“Alright,” Simmons quietly continued, glancing at Andy, who nervously brought his hands away from the table, placing him in his lap. 

“What do you remember about your father?”

Jeff straightened his back as he heard this, 

“Ah, cranky old man. Don’t ever remember seeing him smile. Just always tired from his job, too tired for any of us.”

“Did he ever strike you, as punishment?” 

“No, that would require giving a single damn about his kids. That's something he couldn’t try to muster up.” 

	“Is that why you killed him?” Andy blurted suddenly. Both Simmons and Jeff turned over to look at him, both surprised by him speaking. 

	Jeff chuckled, a sound like a broken exhaust pipe. 

	“You… you’re catching on, rookie. Good head on those shoulders.” He looked into Andy’s eyes, rising in his chair. “Make sure you don’t lose it.”

“Back to your family, Jeff.” Simmons loudly spoke. Jeff looked back to Simmons, and returned to his seat. 

“Yeah, Dad was so unhappy, all the damn time. Up until I made him smile, and smile, and then,” he made the motion of his hand falling down. 

Simmons flipped a page in the manilla folder, tracing his finger as he read. Andy held his hand, coiled in a fist, up to his mouth. Simmons looked up and spoke again.

“You had a brother, right?”

Jeff’s eye widened, “Oh yes. He was such a good guy. Real defensive, always keeping kids off my back. Too bad, too bad he’s gone.”

“He defended you, yet you killed him?”

“Nah nah nah, don’t get it twisted,” Jeff replied, shaking his head. “What happened, he did to himself. Now he’s happy, just like me.” 

“Why, what did he do?” Andy asked, drawn in. Jeff glanced at him for a moment, then just went quiet.

Simmons shot a look at Andy, before loudly clearing his throat.

“Your family was found dead in your home, which had been set on fire,” He began. “We just want to know why.”

 Simmons and Andy waited intently, looking for any changes in Jeff's mood. 

Jeff tilted his head slightly, grunting quietly.

 “They didn’t want to share in the joy.”

“What is ‘the joy’?”

“This,” Jeff pointed at himself, “Is the joy. I;m filled with it. A face like mine knows nothing but smiles, and you can’t help but try and share in the excitement!” 

Andy’s face scrunched up in disgust, like he’d eaten a sour fruit. Simmons simply sat back in his chair, continuing to look through the file.

“I mean, most people refuse, and that’s when I,” Jeff made the motion of slicing his throat, “And then, they go to sleep. I give them a smile, and they’re happy, forever.” 

Andy pounded his fist on the table, shouting into Jeff’s face,

“So that’s your excuse? You killed three of your family because they wouldn’t be ‘happy’ like you?!”

“Richards!” Simmons yelled, standing up from his chair. Jeff began laughing, hysterically. He almost fell back in his chair, but the cuffs kept him leaning forward. 

“Hah aha haha, three? Ahahahahahaaaaa!”

“Now, calm down Jeff,” Simmons started, sitting back in his seat. His voice had become a smooth, calming tone, “I promise Richards will not be upsetting you again.”

He shot a fiery look at Andy, like he was trying to turn him to stone. Andy slumped back in his chair, ashamed.

“Now then,” Simmons continued, “can you tell me about the others you… put to sleep.”

Jeff began settling back in his chair, stopping his manic giggles. 

“Hah, oh yes. Troy, Keith, and Randy. We weren’t on the best terms, different clicks, high school bull, you get the idea. ”

Simmons sat forward slightly, “No, you didn’t.”

“Well it was at a bus stop, and they were acting all tough, giving us dirty looks. We tried told em to fuck off, but they starting getting in our faces. So we fought em’, and we got in trouble for it!”

“Your brother fought them as well, right?” 

Jeff’s ever present grin widened, “Oh of course, but even both of us couldn’t beat all three of them. At least, not until later…”

“What do you-” Simmons was cut off by knocking at the door. He jumped slightly in his chair, before going up to open it.

“I’ll be right back, don’t talk to him until I get back, okay Richards?”

Andy quietly nodded, “Ye-, yes sir.”

Simmons nodded, walking out of the room. Andy sat silently, looking down at the table, trying everything not to stare. Jeff breathed heavily, almost like a happy dog. He stared at Andy, trying to get even a moment of accidental eye contact. Andy tried with all his power to not look back, knowing Jeff's eyes were on him, burning a hole in his head. For just a moment, he broke, and looked back.

Seeing his opportunity, Jeff began, “You’re a detective, right Andy?”

Andy wanted to ignore him, but saw himself answering him. 

“Uh, no. Just an officer.”

“But you wanna be one, right? That’s why Gerald’s bringing you around.” 

Andy shrugged, looking up at Jeff. “I mean, yeah.”

“So tell me this,” Jeff continued, “I have been in here for 20 years, yet someone is out there looking and acting like me.”

“How do you-” Andy attempted, before being cut off.

“But how could that be? Well, let me ask you this, what happens to someone’s fingerprints when they’re burned?”

Andy stood up, backing away from the table as Jeff continued.

“Now, who could look the most like me, who isn’t me?” Jeff continued, staring down Andy while speaking. “Or,,, who could I look like most?” 

Andy had fully backed up to the mirror, his chest heaving in panicked breaths. His mouth was open, gasping for any air. He kept his eyes on… whoever sat at the table before him. Suddenly, he nearly jumped as someone knocked at the door again. He gasped for a moment, leaning over, holding himself up by grasping his knees. His breath returning to him, he walked to the door.

As he opened the door, he saw Simmons standing on the other side. He grinned and opened his mouth to speak, but lost all words as Simmons slumped forward. Andy stepped back, gazing at the knife planted deep in Simmons’s back, before looking up to his killer.

There, standing tall above him, was the face of the real Sandman. Black greasy hair draped down to his shoulders, tangled and unkept. Burns dominated his face, scarred over muscles twisted and warped almost inhumanly, dotted with wisps of scraggly facial hair. A wide, torn smile filled with yellowed teeth. A mere hole for a nose, below two bloodshot eyes, crazed and filled with fire. He wore a dirty and bloodied sweatshirt over his muscled body, above tattered and stained pants and boots.

Andy stumbled back, his breath hitching in his lungs from the sight of Jeff. 

“Time to play Liu,” the killer growled from under his breath. 

With a snap, Andy felt his air ripped from him, as Liu brought the chain of his cuffs to his throat. 

“Shhh,” he hummed, free from his bindings. 

Liu wrestled Andy to the ground, as Jeff took the knife from Simmons’s back.He tried clutching at the chain cutting off his air, but Liu’s strength was too much. He gasped desperately for air, trying with everything he had to fight back, wildly kicking and thrashing. But it was no use.

As the life left his lungs, the last thing Andy saw was the real Jeffery Woods bring a knife to his mouth. The man once cuffed to the table was never the Woods Killer, just his brother, a 20 year decoy. He felt the knife pierce his flesh, slitting open his mouth, as the real Jeff whispered.

I am 22F currently in a masters program with a guy, 23M that I am interested in and I am thinking of asking him out and need some advice. I do not know him well, but I have had a few conversations with him (we’ve only been in our program for 3 months) mostly about undergrad research, and future career plans, but enough to realize he is attractive, driven, and super smart. He comes off as a little bit shy and I am not particularly good at flirting so it has been hard to talk to him in class especially because we do not sit near each other at all. I am not very good at having crushes so I kind of want it to be over (either reciprocated or rejected) so I am thinking of asking him out. I have never asked out a guy before, and I’m not sure if I should or how I should go about it. I’ve seen some guys find it desperate or masculine for women to ask them out and other times guys say they love when girls have the confidence to tell them they are interested so I am really not sure what to do. We are coming up on the 3 week winter break and I am considering dming him on insta about halfway through break and saying something like:

“Hey! I think you are cute and super interesting and I’d love to get to know you better! Let me know if you’d ever be interested in getting coffee or a drink sometime when we are back in town!”

I only am thinking about doing it during break because we are in a pretty small cohort (about 25 people) and I have every single class with him so I think I need a little bit of time after if he rejects me before I can see him again to recover from the embarrassment. I know it’s totally normal to ask people out but I have never done it before and I am usually much more reserved when it comes to guys I like but I’ve realized nothing I’ve done in the past (like trying to subtly flirt) has worked for me so might as well be more direct. Any advice y’all have would be really appreciated it! I’m really out of my comfort zone with this one!

Basically it's the variation in time between your heartbeats, and it tells you a lot about how your body handles stress.

Higher HRV = your body can switch between ""go mode"" and ""chill mode"" pretty easily. Lower HRV = you're stuck in fight-or-flight and your system isn't bouncing back well. That explained a lot for me.

What's actually been helping:

* Slow breathing exercises. Like 4 seconds in, 4 seconds out. Sounds too simple but it genuinely shifts something.
* Moving more, but not killing myself. Walking, some yoga, nothing crazy intense.
* Getting serious about sleep. 8 hours with an actual consistent schedule made a noticeable difference.
* Cutting back on caffeine. This one hurt but I was basically running on cortisol and coffee.
* Eating better - more whole foods, less garbage.

I got a smartwatch that tracks HRV and it's been eye-opening to see how certain days or habits tank my numbers. There's also something called HRV biofeedback training where you can actually learn to regulate this stuff in real time.

I use a V60 exclusively, with a ZP6 Special grinder with a Fellow Stagg temperature-controlled kettle & Fellow scales so I'm fairly deep down the rabbit hole.

The #1 online Australian roaster I've found is Offshoot Coffee in WA, but I'm in Victoria and enjoy buying coffee in person where I can smell the beans through the escape valve in the bag before deciding. Proud Mary is my favourite Victorian roaster thus far but they can be expensive, Constant Coffee in Geelong would be second on my list (but I wish they roasted lighter) and I'd love to find others. 

I gravitate towards Columbian & Ethiopian beans and usually prefer Natural processed over Washed. I really love Gesha but have a hard time justifying the enormous price premium most of the time. Similarly many beans that use more exotic processes can be satisfyingly funky but feel like more of a risk ordering online when you aren't sure if paying 2-4x as much is going to be worth it.

1phwkvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1phwkvq/managing_finances_30m_38f/,Managing finances [30M 38F],"Hi everyone. I (30M) would appreciate some opinions on my family dynamics. First, some background info. I spent nearly my whole life in school, have 2 master's degrees and a PhD in highly competitive fields (as in hard to get admitted and to succeed as a student fields). I have now finally graduated and landed a very well-paid job.

I met my wife (38F) 8 years ago during my master's studies who worked as an event organizer at a research institute nearby. My PhD studies took me far away and we were long distance for a while, she then joined me in my last year, we got married and were blessed with a child. Her move was made possible by her position switching to remote mode but with the fund cuts from the current US administration the institute looked for ways to save money and she was offered a buyout (a large lump sum payment in exchange for her resignation) that she took.

We have been 50-50 on all expenses from day 1 of our relationship but now as her lump sum is running out the relationship is getting strained. Even though we are 50-50, I have been paying nearly all baby-related expenses including clothing, toys and daycare as well as family insurance and other extras. I had no income over the summer and in September (lag in pay) and happily burned through my savings in the gap between graduation and employment without saying a word. I have very little retirement savings as I have been a student my whole life and as I was hired later in the year I had only a few months to maximize my tax advantaged retirement contributions for 2025 leaving me peanuts after tax/deductions, so I continued using my savings as needed (to a much lesser extent than in the summer, obviously this will be different in 2026 as contributions will be spread out). Since my spouse has been in the work force for much longer (and is older than me), she has amassed a significant amount in retirement and non-retirement savings. Now as my spouse's lump sum is nearly gone, she will have to tap into her (non-retirement) savings (which she has much more than me) until she finds a job and is freaking out expecting me to fully cover all expenses until then.

Why am I allowed to burn through my savings but she is not? What is her incentive to find a job sooner rather than later in this case? The baby is in daycare (that I pay for) and she has had all the time to herself (part of which she admittedly would spend recovering from sleepless nights from the baby) and wants to continue doing so without contributing financially until a job is found. Heck I would love to stay home and be provided for as well. 

Her other arguments for me paying even more (if not everything) are (1) she sacrificed her career for me (while in reality she decided to take that buyout herself, her career was already a dead end with virtually no growth for years, thanks to me we moved to a much better location with better opportunities and the baby is her child too - not a gift for me); (2) she spends more time with baby at night (which is true, but this is solvable especially as the baby is getting older and it's already getting better), but again I am paying for daycare, so figuratively speaking in terms of contributions, I am spending all the time with him during the day; (3) she has fatigue from her thyroid issues (but the disease is fairly well understood, treatable and manageable; I myself have an autoimmune disease that has no cure, medical understanding or fully effective treatment that can disable me at any time which makes retirement contributions now particularly important and I constantly fight fatigue with loads of coffee that inevitably triggers horrible migraines with aura at least once a month). Obviously, her sister is on her side (who, by the way, married into wealth, has 2 kids and still works part time), but now she, for some reason, contacted my mom for advice which I find particularly weird/uncomfortable.

I opted for the washed Pink Bourbon coffee, which comes from Moim Coffee in LA. They also included a small ~15g mystery sample, a Third Wave Water light roast profile packet, and a post card along with just some fun packaging and aesthetic additions.

Based on the pricing on Moim’s website, I’d say this is actually a fairly good deal since the cost of the whole box was $37 and just that coffee is $24 directly from Moim.

Snow moon magic 50ml - smells amazing. Like biscoff cookie butter. I wish it lasted longer on my skin. 


English major 15ml - this one is just cool as fuck to have in my collection. It literally smells like old books. I don’t even wanna use it cause it’s so cool. 

The ghost wants birthday cake 15ml - very peachy! Still deciding if I like this one. I love peach but there’s some note I’m not a huge fan of. 

2am in Lafayette 15ml - I’m obsessed with this. The first time I smelled it it was like… spicy? but now it’s a beautiful coffee smell. I’ve never had coffee perfume so spot on. The beignets too. Amazing. 

Dragon fly wings 15ml - super interesting! I’m not sure it’s my vibe. I really get the white rice for a while, and it smells almost lemony on my skin? then it’s floral! weird!

1phwil6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1phwil6/how_to_be_extremely_confident_even_if_youre_quiet/,How to be extremely confident even if you're quiet (what 10 years of studying people taught me),"Then I spent a decade watching how the most respected people in rooms actually behave. The pattern I found changed everything: the quietest person often held the most power.

Real confidence isn't loud. It's calm, controlled, and magnetic in a way most people can't explain.

Here's what I learned:

1. Silence is your superpower, not your weakness

Most people panic when conversation stops. They rush to fill every gap with words, jokes, anything to avoid awkwardness.

Let it breathe.

When someone asks you a question, pause for two seconds before responding. Sounds simple but it does something powerful it shows you're thinking, not performing. People unconsciously read this as high status.

I watched this happen in a meeting last week. Guy got asked a tough question. Counted to two. Then answered calmly. Everyone leaned in. The person who immediately word-vomited right after was forgotten in seconds.

2. Your body language talks louder than your mouth

Quiet confident people move differently. They're slower. More deliberate.

Next time you reach for your coffee, move 20% slower than your impulse tells you. When you walk somewhere, reduce your pace slightly. Rushed movement screams anxiety. Unhurried movement whispers control when you slow down physically, your nervous system actually calms down. Your body language doesn't just communicate to others. It communicates to you.

Stand like you own your space. Feet shoulder-width. Shoulders back but relaxed. Not aggressive, just grounded. Take up the room you're entitled to without apology.

3. Say less, mean more

I used to think I needed to contribute to every conversation to be valued. Wrong. Quiet confident people are selective. They speak when it adds value, not just to be heard.

Before you talk, ask yourself: Does this need to be said? Does it need to be said by me? Does it need to be said now?

When you DO speak, cut the fluff:

* ""Let's try a different approach"" beats ""Um, I was kind of thinking maybe we could try something else?""
* ""I disagree"" beats ""I don't know, I guess I see it differently, but maybe I'm wrong""

People remember the person who said three meaningful things, not the person who said thirty forgettable ones.

4. Master the strategic pause

This changed everything for me. When you finish making a point, stop talking. Don't explain further. Don't soften it. Just let it land.

Most people get uncomfortable and keep talking, which dilutes their message. You staying quiet after making your point is confidence. Silence makes people think about what you said instead of waiting for you to finish so they can talk.

5. React less than everyone else

Quiet confident people consistently under-react compared to the room. Someone tells a funny story and everyone's laughing loud? You smile genuinely but don't perform it. Someone shares exciting news and people are gasping? You say ""That's great"" with controlled enthusiasm.

Plus when you DO show big emotion, it carries weight because it's rare. Your excitement becomes valuable because you don't give it to everything.

6. Have strong opinions you state calmly

This is what separates quiet confidence from just being shy. Shy people avoid stating opinions because they fear judgment. Quiet confident people have clear views they're willing to share without aggression.

You can say ""I completely disagree with that approach"" in a measured, calm tone. The delivery makes the strong stance even more powerful. You're not trying to convince anyone or win an argument. You're just stating your truth.

I've watched this play out hundreds of times people respect clear positions even when they disagree. Wishy-washy stances get dismissed immediately.

7. Control your attention like it's currency

Your attention is valuable. Treat it that way.

When someone's talking to you, turn your full body toward them. Don't let your eyes scan the room. Don't check your phone. Be fully present for those two minutes.

People will remember you as one of the best conversationalists they've met. Not because you said anything profound, but because you actually listened. Almost nobody does this anymore.

also know when to withdraw attention. If a conversation isn't valuable or someone's being disrespectful, politely exit. Your time has boundaries. That's self-respect, and people can feel it.

8. Don't overshare - create layers

Most people anxiety-dump their entire life story trying to create connection. Quiet confident people reveal information slowly.

Surface level stuff first - where you're from, what you do. Then interests and perspectives as rapport builds. Deep vulnerabilities and dreams? Only with people who've earned it.

Scarcity creates value. When you don't give everything away in the first conversation, people become more curious about you. Mystery is magnetic.

9. Stay calm when people try to rattle you

Someone insults you? ""Interesting take"" with a slight smile. Someone tries to one-up you? ""Good for you"" with genuine neutrality. Someone baits you into arguing? ""I see it differently"" and move on.

Reactive people give their power away. When you can't be baited, you can't be controlled.

This is genuine calm that comes from being secure enough that other people's opinions don't shake you.

10. Build real competence in private

Here's the truth nobody wants to hear: You can't fake deep confidence.

But you CAN build it by getting genuinely good at things when nobody's watching. Every skill you master in private adds to your foundation.

Lift weights until you're objectively strong. Learn something until you're objectively competent. Build something until it objectively works.

Confidence is just self-trust. Self-trust comes from evidence. Evidence comes from doing hard things and succeeding. Stack enough of that, and you walk into any room with unshakeable calm.

What this looks like in practice:

You walk into a room. You move deliberately. You observe before jumping in. Your phone stays in your pocket. When someone speaks to you, you give them your full attention. When you speak, every word counts. When there's silence, you're comfortable in it.

People can't explain why they're drawn to you. They just are.

Quiet confidence isn't about being invisible. It's about being so secure you don't need constant validation.

1phwdhw,https://i.redd.it/wcy90hvfe36g1.jpeg,"3-Month Minoxidil Update: My Honest Results, Routine, and What I’ve Learned","Hi everyone! I’m back with my three-month minoxidil update. I previously shared my two-month results and promised I’d continue posting, because reading other people’s updates was genuinely one of the few things that gave me hope during the darkest part of my hair-loss journey. If my experience can give even one person that same hope, then sharing is absolutely worth it.

All progress photos above are real, correctly dated, and taken with freshly washed, blow-dried hair. I’m not selling anything, I’m not promoting any specific product, and I’m not trying to gain anything from this post. I just want to share what has helped me, while acknowledging that everyone’s diagnosis and response to treatment will differ.

My strongest recommendation: see a dermatologist who specializes in hair loss, get the appropriate bloodwork, and consider a scalp biopsy so you actually know what you’re treating. I’m not a doctor, everything here is simply what I’ve learned from my own experience and countless hours of research.

About Me & My Diagnosis:

I’m a 31-year-old female. I was first diagnosed with androgenic alopecia (AGA) at age 25, but it wasn’t noticeable then, so I didn’t treat it. My hair has always been fine and thin, but in May 2025, I began experiencing rapid hair loss.

That loss ultimately led to a diagnosis of lupus, and I was told I was also dealing with telogen effluvium (TE) triggered by the autoimmune flare. Hair loss was actually my first symptom of lupus.

Here’s the timeline of my treatment:
	•	August 2025: Started spironolactone to block DHT for AGA
	•	September 2025: Began hydroxychloroquine and low-dose prednisone (5 mg) for lupus
	•	This week: Fully discontinued prednisone
	•	September 8, 2025: Started 5% topical minoxidil

At the end of this post, I will post what I’m currently doing. I’ve adjusted this routine many times, but this version seems to be giving me the best results so far. I’m extremely happy with my progress, honestly, I never thought I would regrow hair this quickly, or at all. Most people say minoxidil results take six months or more, so getting visible improvement at three months feels like a blessing.

My Biggest Advice for Anyone Struggling With Hair Loss:
	•	Take action early. Do NOT wait for it to get worse.
	•	Get a proper diagnosis. Guessing only wastes time and money.
	•	Be consistent and disciplined. Missing days or half-doing your routine WILL slow progress.
	•	Avoid gimmicky “miracle” products. I’ve wasted too much money on useless things marketed on social media. Evidence-based treatments are where results come from.
	•	Build your routine into daily habits. Mine feels as normal as brushing my teeth now.
	•	Most steps can be done while multitasking (scalp massage, red light cap, etc.).
	•	It’s not as expensive as it may look. Many products last months, some are one-time purchases, and honestly people spend much more on salon visits, daily coffees, or weekends out. It’s all about priorities.

If anyone is feeling scared, discouraged, or overwhelmed about starting minoxidil or any hair-loss treatment, please feel free to reach out. I genuinely love helping others who are going through what I went through.

Treating my hair loss has been life-changing. I’m back at work, going out again, and I’m even in a new relationship, things I honestly didn’t think were possible just a few months ago.

I’m incredibly grateful for my progress, and I truly wish every person reading this finds the same relief, confidence, and regrowth.
You are not alone. ❤️

Current Hair Routine:

• 5% Topical Minoxidil – 2x/day
I leave it on for 6–8 hours. I use Growplex Vitafoam, which includes topical DHT blockers and anti-inflammatory ingredients, and it does not irritate my scalp. I apply it with a small eyeshadow brush, parting my hair in sections and pulling the product down the part line.
I’m not sure if I experienced a “dread shed,” since I was already shedding heavily from TE when I started. I’m currently experiencing no shedding and I lose 10 hairs or fewer when brushing after the shower.
For reference: I do have pets and use minoxidil safely. My only side effect has been increased facial hair, which I dermaplane weekly.

• Spironolactone 75 mg – 1x/day
I increased slowly under my doctor’s guidance and had no negative side effects.

• The Ordinary Peptide Hair Serum – 1x/day
Applied 20 minutes after minoxidil.

• Dermarolling – .75 mm titanium roller, 2x/week
I use the Growplex dermaroller. I replace it every 4 months, use it only on a clean, dry scalp, and sanitize it before and after every use. I use it before applying minoxidil.

• Scalp Massages – 4 minutes/day
Done before minoxidil. I use an electric red-light scalp massager (Arboleaf, from Amazon).

• Red Light Cap – 30 minutes/day
My current cap is no longer sold, but I recommend iRestore or Capillus.

• Daily Hair Washing
Products absorb best on a clean, dry scalp. I blow-dry my scalp on cool immediately after showering and never leave it damp.

• Ketoconazole 2% Shampoo – 2x/week
I leave it on for 15 minutes before rinsing.

Other shampoos I rotate:

•	Growplex Revive

•	L’Oréal Elvive Growth Booster

•	OGX Bond Repair
(I double shampoo every wash.)

• Nutrafol Exfoliating Scalp Mask – 1x/week
Used before showering to remove product buildup.

• Plantur 39 Phyto Caffeine Tonic – 2x/week
Left on for 30 minutes pre-shower.

• Strengthening/Repair Products (as needed):
OGX Bond Repair Serum, OGX Coconut Oil, and K18 Leave-In Molecular Hair Mask.

• Keralyt 5 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo – As needed
Left on for 30 minutes before washing. Because of Lupus, I sometimes get dandruff or irritation; this helps clear it and removes buildup.

• Sleep in a silk bonnet nightly

• Avoid:
Tight hairstyles, heat styling, and hair dye.

• Lifestyle:
High-protein diet, lots of water, minimal sugar, processed food, and no alcohol. Exercise 5x per week.

• Supplements (based on my personal deficiencies):
Iron, Vitamin C, Zinc, Folic Acid, Omega-3, Vitamin D, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Probiotics, Collagen, and Magnesium.
I don’t recommend taking supplements unless you’re deficient or low, too much of certain vitamins can actually worsen hair loss.

• Birth control:
I’ve been on Lo Loestrin Fe for 18 years.

1phw8w7,https://chng.it/RxjxzRQCdx,Sonic Fiber in SF UPDATE: We hit 1.5k signatures! Here is the Next Plan to get Sonic in SF,"Hi everyone!

I hope you’re having a good last few weeks of 2025. We have come so far from our initial signatures this past summer. I’m happy to share that as of writing this, we hit 1.5k signatures and have raised about $1k in donations to help promote the petition! Thank you so much for your time to share the initiative to push for Sonic Fiber in SF.

A brief overview for those who may not know, since this past summer, I've been contacting D7's legislative aid and members from Sonic Fiber to see how we can bring this amazing Internet provider across the city.

When Mike Farrah fell silent after a positive meeting, we sought to approach the mayor of San Francisco to make this happen.

I recently caught up with Bill Greenlaw from Sonic's government affairs team to get a better understanding of why things are still stalled in neighborhoods like the Inner Sunset. It really comes down to two main roadblocks:

Microtrenching Depth: Sonic uses ""micro-trenching"" (narrow, shallow cuts in the street) because it’s cost-effective. State law suggests a 12-inch depth is fine, but San Francisco is insisting on 18 inches. Sonic doesn't have the equipment to dig that deep cost-effectively, which stops them from building underground here.

SFMTA Fees: The SFMTA recently brought back a review process that costs Sonic about $10,000 every time they need to cross a trolley line with their wires. This makes it financially impossible for them to expand aerial service in many areas.

Since there's a pause with the city, Sonic is now focusing on the state of California. In Spring 2026, they plan to submit a proposal to the CPUC (California Public Utilities Commission) to update the safety rules (General Order 128). If this passes, it would standardize the 12-inch depth statewide, meaning San Francisco would likely have to accept it.

New Goal: 10k Signatures by Spring
This gives us a clear timeline. To support Sonic when they go to the CPUC, we need to show massive public demand. I’d love for us to reach 10,000 signatures by next Spring.

Next Steps:
I’m going to start organizing a flyering campaign to get the word out in more neighborhoods. If you want to help post flyers in your area (coffee shops, lobbies, etc.), please let me know! I'd also love some ideas on how to allow people to access the flyers - I've been told that signers are unable to view flyers from the petition.

And of course, please keep sharing the petition.Thank you all for your continued support!

I did a rinse shot and when I went pull my first espresso shot I accidentally didn’t lock in all the way and well it went everywhere… I think this is where I made my next mistake I rinsed out the porter filter and dried it. And tried putting another shot less then a minute later and well it went a lot better except for the fact the porter filter won’t budge and now there’s just wet coffee grounds sitting in the machine I couldn’t find anything on YouTube or in the instruction book to help me with the situation so I went to chat gtp and well it told me to push the espresso shot and steam wand button to shut the machine off and let the puck cool down well I did that and all it did was pull another shot which I can only assume makes the situation worse with pressure. An hour later and it still won’t budge the Porter filter is still warm to the touch i’m hoping it’s not stuck like this for good I don’t wanna leave it like this all night for sanitary reasons and I can’t imagine it being good on the machine chat gtp thinks it’s fine to leave it overnight and the pressure will release by morning but I don’t wanna listen to ChatGPT.

1phw2ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1phw2ry/recruiting_szn/,Recruiting szn,"I'm taking a break from studying for finals and want to share/rant about the reality of trying to line up a job after graduating.

Your target is summer of your graduation year, which means you'll need a junior year internship to get a return offer, which means you need to start recruiting your sophomore year, but you should be getting ready for all this stuff your freshman year. Side note: If you don't have a freshman summer internship lined up, that's not ideal but acceptable. You should definitely have a sophomore summer internship.

Fine, you reach out to people on LinkedIn from your school. The only problem is, at least a hundred others are doing the same. It's impossible to standout but maybe you'll get a couple of coffee chats. If you're really lucky, your dick-sucking game will be strong enough to get a referral so your application is flagged in the system.

It's also a good idea to join some clubs. Even if you attend a top school or an Ivy, you're competing against people who all go to top schools and Ivies. You grind out apps for the usual: finance clubs, investing groups, consulting clubs. These clubs will have multiple rounds of interviews and opportunities for coffee chats with current members/alums, so it's actually good prep for down the line.

As recruiting season ramps up, you'll have multiple opportunities to attend info sessions. These are great! You get to hear a bunch of first-year analysts talk about how awesome the company culture is, how strong the mentorship is, and just how much you're going to LEARN throughout your time at the firm. These people will look like they're on the edge of a mental breakdown, but they're just trying to hit the two-year mark so they can bounce over to HF/VC/PE for a position with slightly better hours and a bit more pay. Maybe one day you'll be just like them.

Given that it's 2025, school does not matter. You take whatever classes you need to and use Chat to get through papers and psets. In this economy, your number one priority is getting a job. Everything else is secondary to that. You'll be having plenty of late nights, but it won't be to study for classes, it'll be to keep up with all of the clubs you joined or to practice technicals and behaviorals for interviews.

What a privilege it is to be among the lucky few.

Obviously this is very much a woe is me boohoo writeup, but this is more or less the reality for a majority of students at top schools. At the very least, it's my reality and despite my dissatisfaction there are no better options. Nobody truly cares about changing the world or getting an education. Some humanities majors try, but by the end of their freshman year they're scheduling coffee chats with Bainies just like everyone else. Is it sad? Yeah, kind of.

The kind of morning that’s unusually quiet, when the sunlight just barely spills into the living room, turning the sofa into a warm, golden spot. The air is a little chilly, but I’m wrapped in a soft blanket, my feet near the fire, completely sunk into the sofa—no thoughts, no rush.

It’s freezing outside, but inside, it’s just perfectly cozy.

You can hear the faintest whisper of wind, but it doesn’t bother you.

And when the sunlight hits your face for that brief second, you suddenly realize—life can actually be pretty gentle.

Nothing big is happening, no goals to chase,

yet in that moment, you feel like the world is softly hugging you.

This simple, grounded kind of happiness—it’s addictive, honestly.

I (28M) reached out to an ex-girlfriend (29F) from college (a “one that got away” situation) recently on a whim, it had been 8-10 years since we had last communicated in any way. We were both in our hometown for the holidays and I asked if she wanted to grab dinner or coffee.

We ended up exchanging pretty rapid texts and catching up for 4-5 hours. Heard from her again a few days later, then the conversation petered out.

We’re from the same city initially, but now each live about an hour outside of it in different directions. About an hour and half apart from one another.

I initially asked about coffee or dinner, and she had said she’d let me know when she was back in our city for the holidays. These were basically our first messages.

She happened to run into my college roommate (who she knows I am still close to because of our conversation) and mentioned she was single, which he and his fiancée thought was kind of a random thing to say at the time.

I’m passing through her city for work next week and I’m extremely tempted to reach out. It’s been about two weeks since we texted, and I’m worried that I am misinterpreting politeness for (at least casual) interest or that reaching out would make it seem like I have an agenda other than catching up (which, if I’m being honest, I absolutely do).

I’m a working adult who has had several relationships since this one, I have no idea why I’m thinking about it so much.

Would you talk to an old ex that you ended on rough terms with just to be polite?

Should I reach out again with an actual invite or just wait a few more weeks to see if she actually does around the holidays?

Should I try to play it cool or not bother trying to hide my intentions?

We were having a conversation awhile back about how there MUST be other people of our age-range who are seeking similar community - people to have a weekly coffee-clatch to discuss current events and other deep/philisophical topics, folks to have emotionally-vulnerable connections without the need to establish romantic connections, etc. 

I’m curious if there are other folks out there (aged 30’s - 60’s, as life experiences are vital to the connection processes) who are interested in this sort of dynamic, and who might be willing to have a meet & greet to establish those connections and really build a solid community?

First off, if you don’t think men can be abused, don’t comment. I’m embarrassed enough as is. 

Anyway, I was seeing this girl for a few months. We were both 20 at the time and met online. She seemed sweet over message, and we agreed to have a date after a few weeks. I went to her place, and spent about 7-8 hours with her. It was great! We walked around town, stopped for a coffee and dinner, and I left feeling good about her. 
Fast forward a few weeks and we decide to see each other exclusively. I started to sleep at her house and we’d spend days at a time together. In retrospect, it was extremely fast. I know that. 
One day, some dumb inconvenience happened, and we had a small argument. Before I knew it, they became more frequent. She would yell at me and strike my face (I would’ve left but I didn’t want to admit to anyone I was hit by a girl). 
I eventually gathered the strength to leave one night, after she blew up at me. She yelled, cursed at me, and hit me. When I told her that I was going to leave, she lost it completely. She began throwing her head back into the wall full force, throwing a tantrum much like a toddler. Then she said she was going to k*** herself if I left, and it would be my fault. She then said that she was sorry for hitting me, but that no one would ever believe me if I disclosed the attacks. 

Now, two years later, I still have dreams of that final night. I have a wonderful woman in my life, and I feel like I’m in a very good place. It’s just the nightmares that haunt me. I can’t forget the physical pain that shed cause me, and I feel ashamed that I didn’t leave the very first time it happened. 
I flinch sometimes when my girlfriend comes up behind me, and I have to lie when she asks me why. I don’t want her to know that I was beaten.  ",1,1765247326.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

although i reached out in september, we met up in november due to our busy schedules. we met up at a place in between is at 10:30 am to get coffee, which he paid for. we talked in a park for a few goes, after that wandered around a nearby bookstore, and then got a late lunch/early dinner, which he also paid for. our day ended at 4 pm and we both went our separate ways. he texted me less than an hour after leaving how we had good timing due to the rain. he said it was nice catching up and he was glad i made it home safely. 

i was the last person to text, and i haven’t heard from him since that day. i know he travelled for the thanksgiving holiday and needs to get back into routines before continuing contact (it’s happened before). i see a lot of green flags with things he’s said to me, him paying and effortlessly spending a whole day together. we didn’t necessarily mention a next time, but when he paid for dinner, i offered to help pay and he said no, so i said i’d get him next time, and he said he’d probably just pay again due to his bad memory. 

i overthink a lot, especially when i like someone. so even though shooting a text isn’t a big deal like i did before, but it’s an awkward situation of the both of us not knowing where each others heads are at. i think im just looking for a green light from someone else to just do it, but any advice about the situation is appreciated<3 ",1,1765247287.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I’ve been taking lessons with a French tutor for about a month now on Preply. On a personal level, we get along great—the vibes are good and he’s a really nice guy. The problem is, I feel like I’m not actually learning anything.

For context, my level is pretty low (I can barely order a coffee fluently without stumbling). Despite this, every lesson he hits me with these incredibly advanced, almost philosophical discussion questions. We’re talking complex physiological or abstract topics that I’d stuggle to even discuss easily in English, let alone French.

Because I obviously can't answer them, we end up spending a huge chunk of the lesson just chatting about random stuff in English.

When I brought this up and told him the questions were way too hard, he insisted that it’s a strategy to ""get me to really think about what I’m saying"" and that it’s good speaking practice. To me, it just feels like I’m drowning and then reverting to English because I don’t have the vocab to support the conversation.

Is this a legit teaching method I’m just not getting? Or is this a red flag that he doesn't know how to teach beginners? I’m debating finding someone new but I feel bad because we get on well.

1phvnfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/1phvnfa/servo_timing_fails_on_arduino_mega/,Servo timing fails on Arduino Mega,"Hello! I’ve got an Arduino Mega controlling a coffee roaster via relays, PWM and one servo.  
The Arduino is driven by a Python WebSocket hub that sends commands over serial (115200 baud). This is a project for which i surely am under qualified so there is a lot of vibe coding included.

Everything works fine at first, but after some minutes of use, my servo “OPEN/CLOSE” commands become weird:

* sometimes the servo starts moving with a big delay
* sometimes it moves only =s instead of 2-3s and then stops
* sometimes it doesn’t move at all, or only twitches

If I disconnect the Python hub and talk to the Arduino directly through the Serial Monitor, the servo SEEMS to behave perfectly fine and always runs for the correct duration. So this feels like a timing/serial issue, however i am still considering a hardware issue perhaps something with the relays and the common GND. not sure though I'd rly appreciate your thoughts. (I'm only saying that because i noticed something that only happened ONCE. when i was switching between 1, 2 and 3 resistors, the servo would move for like 0.2s. idk how that happened.

below i will include parts of my code but if you think its needed i can provide the whole files.  
arduino side:

    // Servo timing state
    bool servoMoving = false;
    unsigned long servoMoveStart = 0;
    int servoMoveDuration = 0;
    
    const int SERVO_OPEN_SPEED  = 2000;
    const int SERVO_CLOSE_SPEED = 1000;
    int SERVO_OPEN_TIME_MS  = 1900; // how long to OPEN
    int SERVO_CLOSE_TIME_MS = 2600; // how long to CLOSE
    
    void loop() {
      // 1) Serial command handling
      if (Serial.available()) {
        String line = Serial.readStringUntil('\n');
        line.trim();
        if (line.length() > 0) processCommand(line);
      }
    
      // ... relay pulses, watchdog, temp stream ...
    
      // Timed servo auto-stop
      if (servoMoving) {
        unsigned long elapsed = millis() - servoMoveStart;
    
        // tolerate some delay
        if (elapsed >= servoMoveDuration || elapsed > servoMoveDuration + 200) {
          drumServo.writeMicroseconds(1500);  // stop
          servoMoving = false;
          Serial.println(""SERVO AUTO-STOP"");
        }
      }
    }
    

Command handler:

    if (key == ""SERVO"") {
    
      // SERVO OPEN (actually runs CLOSE direction)
      if (arg == ""OPEN"") {
        servoMoving = true;
        servoMoveStart = millis();
        servoMoveDuration = SERVO_CLOSE_TIME_MS;
        drumServo.writeMicroseconds(SERVO_CLOSE_SPEED);
        lastServoOpen = true;
        Serial.println(""SERVO OPEN started"");
        return;
      }
    
      // SERVO CLOSE (actually runs OPEN direction)
      else if (arg == ""CLOSE"") {
        servoMoving = true;
        servoMoveStart = millis();
        servoMoveDuration = SERVO_OPEN_TIME_MS;
        drumServo.writeMicroseconds(SERVO_OPEN_SPEED);
        lastServoOpen = false;
        Serial.println(""SERVO CLOSE started"");
        return;
      }
    
      else if (arg == ""STOP"") {
        drumServo.writeMicroseconds(1500);
        servoMoving = false;
        Serial.println(""SERVO STOPPED manually"");
        return;
      }
    
      else {
        Serial.println(""ERR"");
        return;
      }
    }
    

python side:

    async def apply_command(action, value=None):
        # sanitize...
        line = f""{action}"" if value is None else f""{action} {value}""
        await arduino.send_raw(line)         # send command
        # optimistic UI update here
        await arduino.send_raw(""ARDUINO_STATUS"")  # <-- always right after
        # broadcast cached state to all UIs

Accepts commands from a web UI, sends them to Arduino over serial (`send_raw(""..."")`), also sends `ARDUINO_STATUS` after each command to resync state, sends a **HEARTBEAT** every 1s.

You guys think its mainly timing issue or hardware?",1,1765246602.0,arduino,1,1.0,False
1phvncx,https://youtu.be/FLlEB5ztKCo?si=xbJUWc_CCfIaz0Dy,Tired of Waiting for UFO Disclosure? UFO-Track has a Plan...,"Tired of shaky videos and blurry photos? For decades, definitive proof of UFOs has been impossible to find—until now.  
  
UFO-Track is building the world's first rapid-response network for anomalous events, and we need your help. We're a global community of citizen scientists and sky watchers, united by a plan to achieve undeniable disclosure.  
  
Here's how it works:  
  
Rapid Alerts: When a credible sighting is detected, you'll get an instant text notification if you're within 50 miles, telling you exactly where to look.  
  
Real Evidence: With our network, we can get multiple witnesses and cameras on the same event at the same time, gathering the concrete evidence needed to move the conversation from ""incredible"" to ""credible.""  
  
Be a Part of History: Your membership provides you with exclusive investigative tools, training, and access to our vetted UFO database. Join our monthly meetings, connect with a community of fellow enthusiasts, and help us analyze data and hunt for answers.  
  
For just $5 a month, you can join the front lines of the search for proof. It’s less than a cup of coffee and your contribution helps fund our technology, research, and expeditions.  
  
The government may never come clean, but we don't have to wait.   
  
Let's create disclosure together.

I’m a College student whose majoring Game Design. Correctly, I’m a sophomore, people around me tells me I have time or got time on my shouldnt however, I know that time will fly pretty fast, so I’m planning ahead and gathering all information so I wouldn’t be rushing my plan after graduation. 

That’s why I make this comment or story. I want to know how can I enter or connect with individuals who correctly works in the Game industry.

Berry has become more humble and less mean towards the ones she loves and strangers. Ironically, Rob makes her forget everything meta, including himself, by sending Beansie, the hat that kept Berry's memory intact, into the Void.

Berry faces many antagonists this season. This subtly indicate that Berry's finally, or has always been, part of the good guys.

Stuart Monroe's good principles are pushed to the very limit in almost every episode, until he ""breaks bad"" in The Burnout. The Wattersons consider this his ""rite of passage"" into a Watterson proper.

Patricia Senicourt, after 5 seasons of mystery, FINALLY shows up on a two-parter dedicated for her: The Aunt. She's the main antagonist in these two episodes and the final loose end to the character arcs to both Berry and Nicole (Stuart still has The Burnout to tie things neatly).

\*The Boyfriend (also known as: The Upgrade...well, kinda)

Bobert asks Gumball and Darwin how to date, specially how to rely less on his intellect and more on his heart.

Ready for the date, Bobert goes to Elmore's Mall Diner restaurant to meet Berry, who has groomed herself and is wearing a violet dress. They both kinda feel out of place in such a cheap diner. Midway through the date, Bobert is interrupted mid-sentence by a message: ""*Beta Test Completed*"". He then flies back to Roberts Inc. Gumball, Darwin and Berry follow him there.

Over there they meet the CEO: Isaac Robert. (The I stands for innovation. His real first name is Zack).

It's revealed that Bobert is just a Beta version of the real deal, sent to acquire data in schools (cheapest way to make a machine learn, he thinks). Now that he's collected enough data, he'll be discarded and replaced by individual lines of Boberts:

Military Boberts

Romantic Boberts

Best Friend Boberts

Parent Boberts

Teacher Boberts

Son (or Daughter) Boberts

Assistant Boberts

Etc.

Gumball, Darwin and Berry confront Isaac, confident that their Bobert is his own being.

Isaac, in retrospect, destroys their arguments: Bobert is not a friend nor a boyfriend, he's a robot. A tool. He's not even alive.

All the blue cat and the orange fish wanted was a servant, wasn't it? They were never friends.

And the yellow dog...either she has a hidden agenda for what is essentially a super-weapon on legs (loving him only for what he can do for her) or she's a pathetic, lonely, miserable girl that is so desperate for love, she would settle to date an actual computer. Neither sounds good.

Berry agrees with Isaac, thinking that maybe she's dating Bobert out of some deep wicked motives that she's unaware of. She leaves.

Gumball and Darwin catch up with her and give her a pep talk: what does her heart say?

Does it say: ""I'm a pathetic, lonely, miserable girl that is so desperate for love, I would settle to date an actual computer?"" Yes? Good, because there's absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to love. If she's not settling for the easiest grab to date, then she'll *FIGHT* for it"" That is true love.

Motivated, Berry runs back to Roberts Inc. with Gumball and Darwin. They infiltrate the compound and save Bobert, their Bobert, before his whole data is deleted. The alarm is activated and the other Boberts attack. Bobert gives them laser weapons and he goes combat mode (Berry struggles to shoot the other Boberts accurately because they look like him, so Bobert has to cover for her).

{Combat Mode functions at 5% capacity though, due to a system malfunction}

They escape but they end up cornered. Isaac orders Bobert to attack the Wattersons...but Bobert, having reached true human free will, disobeys and destroys Isaac's army.

Isaac says that this isn't over, he'll have his revenge and that he'll sue them all back to the stone ag-

Berry disintegrates him.

Berry: \[Looks at the camera\] ""Kids, never do your villain monologue to someone with a gun.""

Berry and Bobert try dating again, in the middle of all of the destruction. They kiss.

Darwin says that that is very sweet, then proceeds to vomit in his mouth a little.

Gumball: ""Same. I still have several question.""

{That is the true question of the episode: Is Bobert now a living being like us or a robot now and forever?}

{Episode heavily inspired Her (2013), Deus Ex Machina and Robocop. Visually inspired by Astroboy}

{From this point forward Berry and Bobert are an official couple}

\*The Baby (also known as: The Rival)

{Anais' origin story}

Four years ago, Gumball and Darwin discover that babies with high-intelligence are nearly unstoppable, by taking care of their newborn sister Anais.

Everything up until the birth of Anais is virtually unchanged. Everything after is rewritten (for example: instead of Anais throwing Gumball and Darwin out of the car, he just says her first words: ""Dummies"").

Pre-teen Berry makes an appearance during ""Game of Knights and Princesses"" flashback. Gumball and Darwin, as princesses, wait for Berry, the knight, to rescue them.

Monroe says:

""Fear not, my ladies! I've come to save yooou...ur castle.""

She then picks both up, throws them aside and climbs the castle, claming it as her own. She hugs and kisses it.

{This episode is a mix of OG The Rivals and The Mess. Instead of Anais trying to kill her brothers, she just causes trouble by wanting things she shouldn't have and going places she shouldn't go. The catch is that she's a baby with 300 IQ, so she always finds a way to outmanouver and manipulate her brothers. When Gumball and Darwin try to show their parents that she's super intelligent, she plays dumb. That's the comedy, I think}

{The Mess still exists, they're similar, that's all. Unlike that one, here we see Gumball and Darwin at least try to be responsible}

\*The Lady

Richard says that both Nicole and Stuart work all day, so he doesn't have an adult his age to hang out and be friends and stuff, hence why Samantha.

\*The Vegging

Berry's actually in the car with the Wattersons. Gumball and Darwin first call Nicole, then Berry, then Richard.

Gumball: ""Can you come pick us up?""

Berry: ""I'm in the car too.""

Gumball: ""But-"" (Berry hangs the call)

She's saved along with the Wattersons.

\*The One

One of the friends Tobias goes after is Berry Monroe. She's cleaning the gutters while listening to her MP3. He appears from the other side of the roof and prepares to strike his sword at her...but stops and wonders if she is even friends with Gumball and Darwin (they argue a lot). She says she isn't so she won't be attacked.

He then wonders if he should replace her with Anais, instead, then wonders if relatives can be friends or just relatives. Berry tells him to leave before being interrupted mid-sentence and pushed off the roof.

Tobias has acquired her dog powers. Darwin hides in the kitchen and he finds him by sniffing. He then imitates a dog and Darwin asks him what he's doing.

It's later revealed that, just like the others, Tobias didn't kill Berry. He spent too long wondering about ""friends or relatives"" question, so Berry pushed him off the roof instead. She continues cleaning the gutters like nothing happened.

\*The Cage

(A Gumball and Berry episode)

Gumball walks down the corridor with Berry trying to lick his elbow and chips his tooth, looking exactly like her.

Mr. Corneille shows up to the nursery's office looking the exact same. Gumball asks what happened to him and he says that he hurt himself in the cage. Berry misunderstands this as a lie that Mr. Corneille is telling to make himself look impresive in front of the nurse, his crush. She asks if the cage he's referring to is The MMMMA Cage. He's about to deny, but due to the nurse's flirt, he says that it is. It only gets worse from there.

Berry asks him to train them to see how far the lie can go. The fight training turns to ""fight with hugs"" training. Gumball and Berry don't want to touch one another, uncomfortable themselves, and give each other, at most, a hug. Principal Brown witness all this awkwardness and interrupts them to inform that the school's being privatized...into a prison.

In the next day, Gumball and Berry walk down the corridor and hear that Mr. Corneille signed into a MMMMA tournament to earn enough money to save the school. The two kids try talking him out of this suicidal idea, but he asks them if they have any other alternative. They don't.

Having arrived there, they meet Joao. Berry blushes like a tomato and won't stop staring at him. She pulls her beanie down, since she's already got a boyfriend, but it doesn't work (""I can still see him"").

Mr. Corneille ""trains""...but actually just slacks off. He asks them to believe in him. They say they do.

Berry immediately calls Joao's manager to forfeit the fight. Joao proposes more money to them, making Berry more and more tempted. She ends up given in (with coffee all over her face). The money will serve to save the school...and as a little profit for her. Gumball's disappointed in her and so is Mr. Corneille, but for a different reason: They don't believe in him.

He punches the wall and it breaks. Gumball and Berry start believing in him.

During the actual tournament, Corneille walks towards the cage and sees Gumball, Berry and Joan there. Monroe has her beanie down again so she won't have to see Joao. Corneille doesn't seem to mind and hugs them, grateful that they believe in him...because he didn't believe in himself before, it was all a lie, much to their ""shock"".

However, when he reveals that he actually walked into a hamster cage, Berry does indeed become shocked at this. She thought he initially lied to make himself look impressive, but no, she just misunderstood him then mistakenly led him to where he is now. The point was to teach him a lesson (if he even need to learn one at all) but not THIS way, things having gone way out of control. Berry is beyond ashamed. Gumball tells Moonchild that he can still forfeit, but he won't because now he knows he has ""super strength"" due to the wall incident.

Mr. Brown reveals that the wall was actually one dug up by the prisoners. It wasn't due to Corneille.

Moonchild goes down in one hit.

Everyone is shocked and Gumball tries lifting Berry's beanie.

Berry: (whispering) ""K-keep it down, please.""

\*The Candidate

During the intro fight, which is recalled later as well, Ocho ""punches"" Tobias in the face. Berry elbow slams Ocho, technically ""Mario jumping"" him and he loses a life. Tobias thanks her, but she kicks him in the groin.

Stuart can be see on the fundraiser, asleep like the other adults. His glasses are on his eyes on one end and in his mouth in the other.

Berry is in the hot room with the other students. Having heard of Anais' plan, she points out that it's inevitable that everyone'll lose their minds and stop sharing the food. ""Survival of the fittest"" would kick in and the toughest will start hoarding all the food (which Berry believes is that person).

During the fight, Monroe chomps Sarah's head, pushes it downwards making the ice cream ""poop"" and then slips on the ice cream.

When Anais proposes holding an election to choose a leader, Berry calls the idea stupid and goes the opposite direction of her peers. She spends the next few minutes trying to open a cartoonishly unbreakable door and, when Anais desperately asks her cousin to vote (at this point, Gumball's her adversary), Berry shouts that she's not voting for her.

Berry Monroe here is a satire on people that don't vote on elections and the consequences of that action.

During the large hole section, she throws her beanie at the other side, having seen a firehose. She guides Beansie to pick it up for them, but the hat is distracted by a mouse and chases it. Which makes sense, since it's just an animal.

Berry and the others escape the school, which also explodes.

(Ocho replaces Bobert here. Colin is the one that calculates the rising room's temperature and how it's going to be ""lit"". The reason Bobert can't be in this is is cause Berry would sound like an opportunist, when she mentions that the toughest would get all the food. She's getting everything out of her own merit)

\*The Mischief

Gumball and Darwin witness as Clayton makes Berry more and more paranoid.

Berry in this episode seemed a lot more sociable initially. Having remembered the names of a lot of people, being kind, playful. However, her avoidance of Clayton irks him and, to make matters worse, it's april first. He thinks a mischievous person like her would like some mischievous pranks from him.

Berry gets more and more paranoid in regards to Clayton, and before you know it, she's paranoid about everyone and ***everything***. She tries pranking him sometimes, as payback, but then gets sick of it and tries just finding out who's Clayton, who's not, what's his life goals, what he likes, what he doesn't like and what he's ""planning"".

Sick of the pranks, Berry insults Clayton and gives a reality check. However, this only made him resentful.

In the end, Clayton pulls a cruel prank: He pretends to be her and locks her outside the house during Bobert's birthday. All of her friends are there. (Monroe initially looks at this in tears, but then makes the most serene psychopathic face known to man).

She later ""apologizes"" for being so mean to him earlier...then gives him a cruel punishment in return: firing him into a pot and left in the Monroe Residence's shelf. He can't move. He can't speak. Only watch. She laughs wickedly and leaves.

Clayton won't bee seen for a while.

\*The Pact

Berry's in place of Clayton in the Bus part. Principal Brown gestures to sit next to her and she puts Beansie at the vacant spot. Technically taken now.

She's seen again on the school hallway talking to Bobert. They stop to hear Principal Brown expose his plan by mistake in the intercom.

\*The Shippening

Gumball and Darwin meet Berry and Bobert after they exit the grocery store. Suddenly Berry is pulled from Bobert and onto Jared while Clare is pulled onto Bobert. Both Berry and Clare try going back to their respective boyfriends but they end up pulled even harder, making it look like they're kissing each others' boyfriends (Clare hurts her face pretty badly).

Berry gets angry at her friend, but is forced to look into her ex's eyes and fall in love with him. Due to literal words, they all (except Gumball and Darwin) end up washed away by waves.

Stuart would've been shipped with Office Goblin.

Clayton returns still stuck in a jar form (just because he's disappeared doesn't mean that Gumball and Darwin can't use him. It's a magic notebook after all) to have a picnic with Jamie and Tina. Due to poor grammar, he ends up eaten by them both.

Gumball makes Berry and Jared break up (he makes Monroe do a grating voice, for shit and giggles), but due to poor wording, they end up in space, choking to death.

When it comes to breaking up Bobert and Clare, he decides to write in programmer language, but due to not knowing a single bit about programming, he ends up making Bobert explode instead.

Sarah made everything go back to normal. Thankfully, because some of the cast would've died.

\*The Brain

The doctor proposes that Anais should stay with relatives with AT LEAST average intelligence. Nicole proposes the Monroes, but Gumball tells her that they're inconveniently on a trip.

{Bobby's species is replaced with a hamster}

\*The Stalker

Rob makes a truce with his nemesis to find out who is stalking him.

The possible suspects are:

\-Gumball & Darwin (Rob knows it's not them. Gumball & Darwin confirm it too)

\-Anais (One of the prime suspects. However, she probably would've called the police first or get rid of him much earlier. Whoever the stalker is is too careless to be her)

\-Richard (Too dumb)

\-Nicole (If she knew of Rob, ***he'd already be dead***)

\-Berry (One of the prime suspects. Gumball, Darwin & Rob visit the Monroes and notice she's too distracted studying for an exam. Darwin stays behind and watches her, but the stalker still acts while she's studying. Then it's revealed ***that this Berry is actually Clayton's mom following orders to rescue her disappeared son***. The Stalker in the end was indeed Berry all along)

\-Stuart (Too nice. Would've called the police)

\-Granny Jojo and/or Louie (too senile)

\-Penny (Doesn't seem to take Rob seriously, per the episode ""The Ex"". If she did, he'd already be dead)

\-Carrie (One of the prime suspects. However, it can't be her. She would either ice him or scare him into catatonia)

\-Sarah (*The* most likely suspect. It's at this point that Gumball and Rob discover that the Stalker's actually Berry)

It's revealed that Monroe noticed Rob trying to harm Gumball and Darwin not too long ago. She sneakily visited his tent in The Forest of Doom and read his diary, discovering the magnitude of the threat they're facing.

Her goal was to sneakily bully Rob into giving up his vengeful crusade against the Wattersons. The longer it went, the worst it would get.

Berry scolds Gumball and Darwin for treating life threats like these like child's play and for angering a guy *that has nothing left to lose*. Gumball arguments that they just wanted to give Rob a purpose, because without one, he would probably self-destruct.

Berry complains and asks them why they replaced her as their nemesis (and she points out the deja vu the sentence makes on her, referencing the time she said it in The Rerun). Gumball points out the same argument: that she's not ruthless enough to be their big bad nemesis, since she's family.

Berry and Rob fight, against Gumball and Darwin's wishes. The fight takes place in The Forest of Doom, Rob's home.

In the climax, she can't bring herself to throw him into the Void and the police never let him stay in jail too long (status quo and all). She's stumped on what to do. Rob utilizes Berry's brief distraction to successfully throw her beanie, Beansie, into the Void, making her forget everything that's fourth-wall breaking and guaranteeing his future safety. He almost kills her as well (by pushing her off a cliff and almost into the monsters below), but she's saved by her cousins.

The episode ends with Rob telling Gumball and Darwin that just because they helped him doesn't mean they're now ""buddy-buddies"". He'll still destroy everything they love and make their lives a living...

Nicole, Richard and Anais have just arrived and heard bits and pieces of what Rob said. Nicole glares at him furiously (and Richard confused) but then discards it as just ""boys being boys"", playing heroes and villains and stuff. The three enter the house, with Anais suspecting Rob from something.

A nervous Rob tells Gumball and Darwin that he's just seen his life pass before his eye. Awkwardly, he tells them he's going home and walks away.

Gumball & Darwin: ""Bye, Rob!""

Rob waves back, realizes that waving back was dumb and just motions in a ""forget it"" manner.

(Berry remains hatless for the rest of the season, meaning she'll be completely oblivious to the Void, Rob and the fact that they live in a TV show. Also Clayton's back)

\*The Founder

Stuart sings the ""He's Back"" song along with other Chanax employees and employers. However, when Richard finally arrives, he's the first one to say that that isn't him.

Unfortunately, the Goblin CEO 2 doe not let him finish the sentence and opens the hatch below him, making Stuart fall and hurt himself (which consequentially makes Richard shocked and play along so he won't get hurt also).

Mr. Monroe appears again during the ""Funfunctional"" ad, complaining about Richard's seriously dangerous ideas.

When the ad finishes, Stuart is at his office space pausing the video, with bandages all over his body. He sighs in frustration. Nicole appears in the background looking for the manager and Stuart calls her (she forgot he works there and so did Richard. She remembered his name at least).

Stuart tries paying for Nicole's bill on the internet but a rock falls on his PC. He then complains about Richard stepping up as founder, which simuntaneously shocks and frustrates Nicole.

Nicole exits, angry, the dance floor elevator while a tired and pained Stuart waits inside. Richard's lie is exposed and he reveals to the CEO that he was just playing along so he won't get hurt.

Stuart warns them that the building's falling apart. They all escape in an ice cream truck.

(Chanax Inc. building falls apart, which grants them the opportunity to now use Stuart's redesigned building, pitched to cut costs hiring a proper architect. This will come into play in The Burnout, where it's revealed that the new building can be automated into a maze, part of Stuart's revenge plot against Chanax. Inc. top executives)

\*The Aunt Part 1

Patricia Monroe has escaped Elmore Penitentiary and is headed towards the Monroe residence. Hiding in the bushes, she sees Stuart leaving the house and leaving Berry alone there once again.

Trish then starts remembering her childhood.

This entire episode focuses on Patricia's youth, divided into:

\-Patricia's birt/Baby years

\-Toddler/Child years

\-Pre-teen years

\-Teenage years

\-Young Adult years (up until Berry starts asking her mother to take her with her, since Trish's been ignoring her for a while)

The episode ends with Trish snapping back to the present and walking towards the front door. She rings the bell. Berry answers the door and gasps in horror. We finally see what she looks like now (that design with black tank top and gray jeans), and she drops a very menacing line.

\*The Aunt Part 2

Stuart returns home and notices that the door was left open. Berry's nowhere around. He turns on the news and sees a warning that one the most vicious criminals in Elmore is on the loose (""board your doors and windows. If you left any pets outside, leave them."")

Nicole crashes her car into the house, scaring Stuart.

At this point we have three things happening:

\-Patricia and Berry commit crimes through Elmore (similar to The Understandings & TWWWOG's The Teacher)

\-The Wattersons & Stuart try to find those two (while Patricia shares cryptic hints. It ends with her challenging Nicole to a rematch. If she doesn't appear at the exact time, the snowshoe cat is going to keep wreaking havoc until Elmore's nothing but rubble)

\-A flashback revealing the source of Berry's mental issues: she was manipulated by her mother to be a greedy, entitled criminal.

Arriving at the arena (Elmore Junkyard), Nicole and Stuart leave the car. Gumball, Darwin, Anais and Richard stay at the car because they're scared out of their minds. Mr. Monroe tries to reason with his ex-wife, but she quickly figures out it's a distraction to allow her sister to find Berry. Trish knocks him out with a coin and Nicole appears. A battle begins. Nicole's about to win...until she realizes that's her sister she's fighting. Patricia quickly gets the upper hand and incapacitates Gumball's mom. She's about to crush the poor woman with car (""Now...*you'll never win ever again*.""), but is stopped by a desperate Berry.

Her daughter gives her a reality check. Patricia realizes she's no better than her parents...

But she doesn't apologize.

And flees into the desert.

Disappointed and heartbroken, Berry cries and her family comforts her.

At the Monroe residence, Berry's about to leave. Stuart asks her to wait and she does so, hesitantly (she's still mad at him for being a neglectful parent all these years). He takes responsibility for his faults and apologizes. Berry turns back and hugs him, thanking him for trying.

\*The Ad

Nicole faux writes the ""Bed-n-Breakfest"" review as the goats.

Nicole: \[Sighs\] ""Congratulations, Nicole. You've officially sunk to your sister's level."" \[Puts phone on table counter\]

\*The Ghouls

During the ""All Hail All Hollow's Eve"" song, Berry appears dressed up as Cerberus (literally two of her own paper machê heads taped to her shoulders. She didn't even change her clothes) while Stuart appears dressed up as a mad scientist to be exact (he does a pretty neat trick involving chemicals, turning them into candy and giving them to the kids).

Berry later appears at her own home, studying for an exam. She receives a phone call and... (it's pretty much Sarah's part: she finds Ghostface and locks him inside to watch scary movies. She's not seen again in the episode).

\*The Buddy

After Bobert says ""This is too intrusive a question"", Jamie immediately assumes Bobert's cheating on Berry with the school computers, which genuinely puzzles Anais. The robot clarifies that she's home, sick, and asked him to pass the homework online. Jamie then assumes he got cooties from her, which Anais corrects as literally impossible. She asks Bobert why he deleted the camera footage and he shamefully answers that he does it everytime he uses his USB cable to transfer files, disgusting both Anais and Jamie.

Anais then ponders who did it. Before Bobert can say anything, someone drops a dictionary over his head, heavily damaging him. Berry's signature can be seen on the dictionary, from months prior, written as just ""Berry"". She's not in the episode however.

\*The Body

Bobert builds himself an organic body so that he can belong with organics more, specially Berry. However, he finds himself more and more uncomfortable with the organic experience.

The episode starts with a montage of Berry and Bobert going to some places of Elmore, a la ""The Drama"". Bobert starts to notice the differences between his body to Berry's and starts to envy organics a bit. Berry and him discuss it for a bit and she says that being organic sucks.

At home, Bobert builds an ""organificator"" to turn him human. However, we only see his human form next day.

Next day, we have Bobert's POV. The students react to his appearance with horror and disgust. When he approaches Gumball and Darwin, they have a half a minute long (comical) reaction. Berry's a bit surprised, but not disgusted. She tells him that whatever form he's most comfortable with is good enough for her.

(Bobert's human form is not like the human forms from The Nuisance nor from The Inquisition. It literally has the same silhouette as his old form. He has black hair, one permanently closed eye, white skin, noodly arms, a tiny mouth, etc).

Gumball, Darwin and Berry guide him in how to organic. Hilarity ensues. (Bobert forgets and realizes many things: some foods taste good, some taste horrible, some may make him extremely sick...or kill him; he cannot access the internet through his mind, but the computer/phone instead; he can't defend himself from bullies with his tough skin nor weapons; he has to go to the restroom; he can't fly and some heights are lethal; sleeping takes time, too much time for him; he has to mind his weight; etc etc etc).

Climax involves Bobert being in grave danger. If he dies, it's over. He would not be able to be fixed like his older self. Worse yet, he does not have a soul.

Reiterating: If Bobert dies, he's ***gone gone***. Berry's freaking desperate to say the least.

Bobert's saved and he decides to return to his robot form. The yellow dog's relieved and tells him the truth: she prefers him much more with a metallic skin. Gumball and Darwin are puzzled by Berry's...choice of attractions.

Before Bobert goes home, he tells the three of them that it wasn't for naught. Going through the many struggles of an organic, he gained a deep newfound respect for organics.

Next day, Bobert's back to normal. Berry gives him a kiss and he ""kisses"" her back. He then wiggles his ""eyelid"" and tells her that not all organic body parts went to waste......he then opens his head and reveals an organic cyborg brain, amazing her.

The episode's stinger has Rob robbing Bobert's ""organificator"" schematics (we only see his arm and shadow).

\*The Burnout

Stuart loses it and quits Chanax Inc.

Now he plots his revenge as his secret alter-ego: Fenrisúlfr.

The episode starts with Stuart desperately leaving home, as he's late. Turn out he wasn't. At Chanax, he does several tasks for the CEO, in a manner extremely similar to Banana Barbara in ""The Future"", except here his eyes and mouth don't light up. He just becomes dizzy and, before he realizes, he's completely naked on the street (a hydrant cover his parts).

On the next day, Stuart returns to the CEO office and sees the CEO Goblin reading a newspaper with a picture of naked Stuart on the front page, and laughing. Stuart's there to resign. The CEO tells him can't do that...because he'll fire him first! He then tells him to leave and clean his desk in 10 minutes before security takes him away.

At home, Berry tells the Wattersons that she's extremely worried with her father. He's acting in an extremely uncharacteristic manner: relaxed, lazy and a bit rude. They tell her that he'll probably return to ""normal"" once he gets another job to obsess over.

Suddenly, Zip Schalalalabagram from Channel 6 reports that Chanax Inc. board of directors suffered severe accidents in the past few days. Police suspect that one person is behind the attacks.

The family gasp, then say they've never seen someone targeting rich people before. Darwin then gasps again and remebers that Carmen's dad is part of the board of Chanax and may be the next target.

Gumball, Darwin and Anais go see Carmen and her father, while Berry, Richard and Nicole accompany Stuart to make sure he's okay.

Berry and the Wattersons discover that it was Stuart targeting Chanax actually. Worse, Mr. Verde's just gone to Chanax with the other elite and may be targeted along with them.

Stuart's nowhere to be seen.

A masked hat guy on TV, named Fenrisúlfr, threatens Chanax Inc. and everyone affiliated with the company.

Berry and the Wattersons go to Chanax to stop Stuart's insane plan: he's using the building as a rocket that'll crash into the moon (employees and colleagues have been sent home by him, as he believes they're completely innocent and he's very fond of them).

(Berry doesn't want her father to kill anyone, because then he'll turn into her mother. She NEEDS him as a role-model)

Once at Chanax, the Wattersons notice that the new building was retrofitted into a moving labyrinth that always sends them back to the entrance. Anais tries outsmarting Stuart, but fails.

The only one that can stop him...is Richard. A guy so chaotic and stupid that no amount of plans can predict him.

The system that makes the building into a rocket is broken by him.

(Fenrisulfr talks to the Wattersons through the monitors and reacts to their shenanigans. They tell him he knows who he is, but he refuses to reveal his identity. He tells them to give up, for their own sake)

The traps from the labyrinth are pretty tame and safe, mainly because they're programmed to appear when a work colleague or ""Stuart's"" family member show up. If it were someone from the board, then the more...lethal...traps would show up.

They reach the upper levels and ask the board to leave. The board mocks them, except for Mr. Verde, who finally believes in Gumball, Darwin and Anais' words. He gets out with the family.

Once outside, Stuart gets out of a white van and tells them that it was all for naught, as he still has a way to make the rocket work. A remote button to activate it. Berry tells him not to do it, as she really doesn't want him to become like her and her mother.

He gets back to his senses and accepts arrest. Stuart has an epiphany: while Chanax's at fault, he was also the instigator for his own mental breakdown, as he should've quit much earlier and gone to a job with a much healthier work environment. And obviously, he shouldn't have worked himself so much, but taken a bit more time to ""live life"" instead.

Berry apologizes to her father for also being a long-time instigator of his mental breakdown and he admits to her that the only thing that has prevented him from ""losing it"" much earlier, all these years, WAS her.

Once at the cop car, the Wattersons tell him that he shouldn't worry. They've all been arrested, it's a rite of passage. *He's a Watterson now.  :)*

Stuart laughs maniacally as he's taken away.

One cop looks at the remote button, the evidence, and thinks it's trash. He throws it at the trash bin, making the Chanax building launch anyway.

And just like that, Chanax Inc. is no more.

\*The Master

Gumball, Darwin, Anais and Berry are arguing with each other during family diner. Richard asks them what's wrong.

After Gumball, Darwin and Anais give their explanations, Darwin tells him that they won't be able to sleep tonight because of Berry's incessant snoring (she's sleeping at the Watterson's due to Stuart being in jail, remember?).

Anais, a day before, dropped a doll on Berry's mouth to make her stop snoring. The yellow dog now has a doll inside of her that activates everytime she hiccups.

To resolve the kid's differences, Richard makes them play D&D. Gumball, Darwin and Anais are on their OG roles. Berry is ""Roach The Rogue Ranger"" (Aragorn + Boromir pastiche).

The episode goes as usual, Berry tries to shoot the owlbear, then gives up and tries to throw a sword but fails and is swallowed. Afterwards she tries striking Gumball/Mario Kebab with a sword, who's trying to throw a hatchet at a snake, but both fail due to the dice being affected by Darwin and Anais' fight. Etc.

She joins her cousins to defeat Richard/Witch Beast. Her cousins try angering her, only succeeding when they lie that the Witch Beast called her a dog.

They defeat the Witch Beast, gain the treasure and learn a beautiful lesson: ""The greatest treasure was the time we spent together.""

\*The Revolt

Darwin and Berry show Gumball their attempt of raising a charity for the objects. She really looks like she gives a darn here. The blue cat remains skeptical all the way through.

However, the submissiveness of the objects really tests the patience of Darwin and Berry. Monroe eventually realizes that Gumball must be jealous that she's finally doing something completely selfless for once, but the blue cat just thinks they're both nuts.

Something that Gumball says about objects being replaceable angers the objects, not helping that Berry shows them a video of it and Gumball literally throwing his phone away.

The objects revolt and take over world, forcing non-objects to be their objects.

Gumball is forced to be an easel, Berry is forced to be a chair (""butt supporter"") and Darwin...a pencil sharpener.

\*The Inquisition

Cameo

Appears next to Gumball, Darwin and Anais during the Superintedent Evil speech. Just like Anais, she goes missing afterwards.

Superintedent Evil's machine is identical to the one Bobert drew in ""The Body"", subtly hinting to the audience that Evil is Rob. Also the robot's been used as a battery to make it work (he's not turned into a human because he already tried to in ""The Body"" and, as we've 'seen', the results were less than desirable). After Gumball and Darwin save the others, they rescue him and try breaking the machine. They fail, leaving Bobert to be the one to destroy it (Bobert also informs them that this machine was designed by him and was stolen by...someone else. Rob basically).

* COMICS

\*Issue 1

Nicole, Anais & Berry walk down the sidewalk (the two kids are eating ice cream). Gumball and Darwin drives down the street, making Berry's ice cream fly and fall on Anais' face.

The yellow dog later reappears when she hears her cousins grieving the car they lost. She tricks them into taking a driving test to earn a license. When they leave, Anais enters the bedroom and tells her how bad of an idea that was. Berry responds that they won't make it past the front door.

\*Issue 3

Gumball and Berry are arguing about something. Darwin and Banana Joe try to de-escalate the conflict. Berry eats Joe and makes Gumball play a game of Tag. The blue cat doesn't notice she was exaggerating and takes the game seriously. She nervously flees.

In The Amazing Journal of Darwin, he notes that Berry and Stuart are dogs, then asks the reader to not let his cousin see this. He also meets her at the pool and when they're running from a slime monster.

\*Issue 7

At Mr. Small's detention room, Gumball asks his cousin to make a distraction, promising that he'll owe her one. She asks him ***if he's really sure about this***. Scared, he takes back what he said and just asks Mr. Small to go to the bathroom.

When Gumball fulfills all the ""one"" he promised and reaches Larry, the dude tells him that he gave he's ""one"" to...***Berry Monroe.***

Gumball has a nightmare where Berry demands his brother as a one he's owed. She shrinks Darwin into a normal goldfish and puts him in a fishbowl.

Later, when the blue cat goes to her house's front yard fulfill the one, she tasks him to rake the leaves...with a fork. She laughs evilly and enters the house.

\*Issue 8

When Darwin and Anais reach the park, they're startled by Berry (she's been following them for the last fifteen minutes).

Darwin tells her Anais' being bullied by Billy, prompting Monroe to pull up her sleeves. However, the goldfish wants to prove to them that violence is never the answer.

He fails. Berry punts Billy across the park. Anais comforts a saddened Darwin by saying that violence is the answer when the first one isn't good enough.

Anais, Berry and Darwin eat sandwich together.

\*Special Issue

When Gumball and Darwin ask her to try the headphones, all Berry hears is some bearded loser with a banjo singing about how lonely he is.

\*Comic Ad (explanation: in the TAWOG comics, some characters had wacky ads)

*Need help dealing with bullies?*

*Hire the*

*Berry Protective Services!*

*""I bargain for you!""*

*""I fight for you!""*

*""I blackmail for you!""*

*""Or, if you prefer, I can watch you 24/7!*

*Call now!*

*\*Costs depend on how tough the bully is.*

*\*No refunds.*

Phew. Phew phew phew. Thank you for reading this book.

There's nothing grandiose planned for Berry in TWWWOG. I think her darkest and most epic moments are behind her (although, I do believe she would struggle a bit during her adult years). What I'm saying is: there's no arc. It's all ""filler"" from now on.

The character of Patricia gets ""retired"" in the trial episode (as in, she returns to being a flashback-exclusive character). I'm pushing that episode to ""Season 8"" (season 2?) because I think a story centered around Frankie and her would be pretty funny (Gumball, Darwin and Richard help Frankie hide from Patricia. The rat then has to decide if he's leaving Elmore forever or finding a way to push Trish out of the city).

However, I thought of something pretty cool for Stuart (and maybe Beansie). Something truly existentially terrifying...

All depends on what the Void truly is. I'm basically gambling here.

(It won't turn his life into a living hell though. Him being in good terms with his family, working at EJH and later dating Mr. Small helps balance things out. He's just going to go through a quick cosmical struggle)

Anyway, thank you for reading!

I’ve been on this dosage for two years for generalized anxiety, social anxiety, insomnia and mild depression. I love lexapro in terms of helping mellow my anxiety and completely eliminating my social anxiety, but the fatigue and low motivation to get things done is killing me. I take it at night and it does help me get sleepy, but I’m tired all day long. Literally exhausted to the point where I have low motivation to do much of anything and find it hard to write (I’m a writer). I also wake up multiple times through the night. 

I can’t take the fatigue anymore, even with coffee, b6, working out, and energy pills I’m still tired all the time. I remember at one point I was on 5 mg of Lexapro (over three years ago) but I was only on it for about 2 months before my doctor added Wellbutrin to help with the sex drive and the combo of the two. just made me very depressed and tired all the time. Before the Wellbutrin was added I don’t remember being sleepy on the 5 mg dose of Lexapro.


I’m Wondering if reducing Lexapro to 5 mg would help offset the fatigue and numb the sex feeling but still help with social and generalized anxiety? Has anyone had success going from 20 mg to 5 mg and still saw benefit with managing anxiety?",1,1765246041.0,lexapro,1,1.0,False
1phvfqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildrenofDeadParents/comments/1phvfqb/my_mom_almost_died_in_a_car_accident/,My mom almost died in a car accident,"My father died when I was 21 and my sister was 17. I was living out of state and my mom and sister took my father to a local hospital when he had a heart attack. He died in that hospital. My sister is medical and can hardly bring herself to go near that hospital. 
Of course, all three of us share grief for the same person and like all grief, it’s different for everyone but honestly I’m really glad I didn’t have to witness that.

Fast-forward 22 years later  last weekend where my sister and I were alerted by iPhone emergency that my mom had been in a critical crash two blocks from my house. 
When I arrived, my sister was already in the ambulance. Because of some luck of the universe, an ER doc happened to show up so I never got to get in the ambulance and see my mom. You can imagine what was running through my head after seeing the aftermath of the crash and not seeing her. 

All I have to say is thank heaven for seatbelts. She broke her sternum and likely her nose but somehow there were no internal injuries. So much to be grateful for but the ER room we had was directly next to the room, my father died in. I don’t share the same trauma as my mother and my sister and we don’t talk about it, but I imagine their nervous system is shot after this, especially having it bring back all of those memories.

I used to be a ruminator and I’m working hard to move past that. The day after the crash when I knew my mom was OK. I went back to the scene and I went back to the place that I was when it happened just to get that over with.

I feel OK but every once in a while, the fact that she could’ve died and her life could’ve been over and a split second while I was enjoying coffee briefly haunts me.

I don’t want to push this down and deal with it later. I want to deal with it now or at least in the healthiest manner possible. But I also don’t want to find myself ruminating. 
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to handle this in a healthy manner?  She’s the only parent I have left, and it scares me to be the one making these decisions for her. And it scares me to think that one day she’s not gonna be around and I’ll have no parents. And I have no partner and no children. It’s just a weird place to be in. I’m sure many of you understand.

Please don’t hesitate to leave your advice to me. I’m definitely seeking it.  Thank you in advance.",1,1765245997.0,ChildrenofDeadParents,0,1.0,False

In this dream I would be picked up by my grandma at the Syracuse airport, but instead of driving the 2 1/2 hours to her home, she would stop at these old brick apartments with a large parking lot in front of the doorway, a basket ball court off to the side, and a row of small rental houses beside it.   
  
We would go inside to meet Grandma's friends, and Grandma would start talking to them over a cup of coffee. The conversation would be super boring, and the apartments were stuffy and smelled musty, so I would lay on the floor of the living room or on the couch and just stare at the ceiling until they either stopped talking or I woke up. It was such an odd reoccurring dream. Especially since my grandma didn't know anyone in Syracuse, and my family and I only went to the city to go to and from the airport. 

Today I had to go see a specialist in Syracuse, and while we were driving there, I saw the exact apartments! They were two brick buildings with a small residential neighborhood next to them. Even though the buildings looked newer in my dream, I could still tell it was the same buildings. I couldn't see very well out back because we were driving, but it looked like it had a large parking area and a recreational area out back. 

The buildings were called Tipperary Hill Apartments, and I am still really confused on why I would have so many reoccurring dreams about these apartments despite never being there in my life!

I’m rather surprised that Lord Dimitri agreed to this outing so easily. I was fully expecting him to tell me no again. Not that I don’t understand the paranoia. He is fighting a battle that takes place more so in the shadows than in the light since most gods have to put on a benevolent act to keep their followers but, their altruism fades immediately when they feel threaten. A lot of the time, it truly does come down to the lesser evil. Ultimately, the gods themselves decide what they want to aim for but, that can be shaped slightly by the way their followers see them, possibly adding onto their domain.

But, while Lord Dimitri has been a god for a while and his followers grow by the day, his domain hasn’t changed for quite a while.

This is quite a problem.

While the numbers are good and the domain is managed quite well, surely there should be a change by now. Those with a more devout belief should be spreading the faith and discussing ideas that should expand it. But, with it stagnating the way it has been, this means they haven’t been. I worry as, even though the domain is pretty promising as it is, no domain should never change. It means it stops growing in size and power.

My hypothesis is probably because Lord Dimitri hasn’t made an appearance in a while. He mostly sends Jack out to deal with any serious problems and that might be a factor in it as well. After all, why would the same solution lead to a new outcome? No, I think it would do wonders for Lord Dimitri’s mental state and also spark hope in the followers. Would I be lying if I said that Lord Dimitri’s domain wasn’t already impressive? I would but, that’s not the issue. It’s my job to help Lord Dimitri grow in any way I can.

And about Jack, while they have been together far longer than I have been here, I don’t quite understand the animosity Lord Dimitri has for him. Jack has always gone out of his way to help Lord Dimitri in any way he can. And like I mentioned, while we have so much paperwork due to him doing his job, I am quite grateful. It shows that we are still growing at quite a rate. However, Lord Dimitri seems to think that it’s an act to get him to drop his guard. Make Lord Dimitri comfortable enough so Jack could start a coup. Lord Dimitri still has his suspicion that Jack was behind the Great Firing but, I don’t see it that way.

If I had a guess, they tried to bring Jack to their side and he turned them down. He was probably on his way to the main office to report it and that sparked the coup since they thought he would change his mind if they were able to succeed in overthrowing Lord Dimitri. I don’t understand why they thought that but, they were probably living in a fantasy since, even if they succeeded in even getting to Lord Dimitri in the end, he himself is no pushover. And to entertain the thought even a step further, if they had some secret way of pulling it off, Jack himself wouldn’t have let that go in the first place. Lord Dimitri is also his lord and they have an airtight contract with each other. How would that look if he let them get to Lord Dimitri when he was supposed to protect him?

This is all speculation on my part however. I was away that day on a mission, back when Lord Dimitri was more trusting of everyone else. Granted, it’s probably due to me being an Archangel and being away that day that proves to Lord Dimitri that I am his most reliable aide. I have not been allowed to be too far from him since, not that I am complaining. Being in his presence is a dream come true to me.

“So, what is this restaurant you were talking about Rose?” Lord Dimitri asks.

“Ah, yes. It is in Spiritopia, a quaint little café that has come up in my reports saying that they serve quite an impressive coffee and tasty meals. The view was worth mentioning too apparently.” I answer.

“And the name of it?” Lord Dimitri asks.

“Oddly enough, the name was omitted and there was just an address. It seems like the owner forgot to include a name in the paperwork when they created it as their species is not known to name things. They just did them.” I answer.

“Ah, so the owners are Blurbkaceans?” Lord Dimitri inquires.

“The agent who submitted the report did not say but, they speculate that it is highly likely that was the case. However, there are plenty of other species that are doers more than they are those that work paperwork.” I answer.

“I see. Blurbkaceans are indeed one of many but, they are the most likely since they focus on recreational activities more than the others that typically wind up being warlike. Which most people mistake from the fact that they don’t really have a normal version of communication. The fact they are able to develop a high level of sentience shows how good they are adapting to civilizations. So, the café does sound promising if that is the case.” Lord Dimitri answers.

I grab my parasol as I walk beside my lord towards his private portal.

A quick jaunt through and we arrive in a secluded spot in Spiritopia that was reserved for Lord Dimitri. It’s a spot hidden in the back alleys, close to the police station. We walk out and are met with the large amount of people here. Although, I can’t help but feel like more people should be recognizing us. Especially Lord Dimitri. But it’s fine, being swarmed by believers is an exhausting experience.

This is different. Not even a glance. That is not a good sign for being a god. But, it’s fine. It could just be an instance of most of the believers being on vacation or traveling somewhere. A good number of the followers are homebodies.

Two large species block our way as they ask, “Hey little lady. Why not ditch this loser and come with us? We can certainly have a good time together.”

I’m honestly dumbstruck. It takes a second for me to utter the question, “Are you serious? Do you not grasp who you are in front of? Who you had the audacity to just called a loser, as you put it?”

“Some loser in a suit with a beautiful lady on his arm.” The morons have the audacity to reiterate.

I’m trying to wrap my mind around this heresy but Lord Dimitri slides forward as he states, “You were right Rose. I must have stayed too isolated for too long. People seem to have forgotten about me. Allow me to educate you then so that, whatever happens next, is entirely on you. I am Dimitri. God of Order and Shadows. Does that ring a bell?”

They look at each other rather quizzically as one snap his fingers as he remembers, “Oh yeah, he’s the one guy who holds that monster Jack’s leash. I thought he was a rumor.” My lord twitches at what the statement. “Oh yeah! That one. Jack keeps going around talking about him so I only took it with a grain of salt. You think if we take him hostage, we could exert control over Jack?” the other moron states. “Woah bro! That would put us at the top of the food chain!” the original moron states. “Yeah…” the other moron starts to say.

Lord Dimitri interrupts them, loathing dripping in his voice as he slowly starts to grow and says, “You ungrateful halfwits. Do you think that there is all to me? Jack? If you think that controlling him is so easy, it is not a matter of words. I have the **power** to keep him in check. The **authority** to keep him bound to me. And the **intelligence** to know how to use him best. You two **buffoons** think that you have what it takes to do what I do? **Lead how I do?!** And the most insulting part, you think **all I do, is keep Jack in line? I am a God. A God of Order and Shadows! And there is only so much of an insult I can take!”** He stops, completely towering them at this point.

Observers come flying over as one asks, “Observer seven zero nine five checking in during his routine patrol. What seems to be the issue here Divine Aide Rose?”

Before I can answer, Lord Dimitri states, “These two have performed the act of heresy towards me and I wish to enforce my divine authority to punish them.”

The observer looks at the two and activates their stare on the two hooligans.

This is a serious accusation, not that it isn’t in Lord Dimitri’s right to enforce this rule. At best, they will be shunned by an entire community. At worst, a rather showy sacrificial rite. They could possibly work by repenting in a way that pleases the deity in question. Either way, this is a serious matter. This is the reason why people usually dance on eggshells around deities. If they feel like they have been insulted at a fundamental level, they can enforce this law. And there are only very few instances where the accused get to walk away.

The observer speaks, “Rulph and Recarndo Bullark, you have been accused of heresy of a deity by the deity in question. How do you plea?”

The brothers look at each other, growing paler by the second as the realization is setting in as their future is hanging by a thread. I sprout a pair of my wings fly up towards Lord Dimitri’s head and whisper, “Forgive me my lord. While I too would like to see these heretics suffer for their decision, mayhaps it would be better to let them go with a slap on the wrist. While the point of this excursion is to reintroduce yourself to the public, would you prefer to have us start our expedition with violence?”

Lord Dimitri puts his fingers to his metaphorical chin as he considers the possibility. “While I am loathe to just let them go after such a transgression, and I trust your judgement, even though you also know how much I hate the moniker of being known as Jack’s leash holder. I am the god, not him.” He states.

“I know this my lord. I don’t make this suggestion lightly. But you are my highest priority, first and foremost. I simply wish to show the world the same benevolence you have shown me. Mayhaps a lesser punishment than the one you were thinking of?” I ask.

“Hmm… true. Making a public showing of a slaughter of such a scale would definitely be good ammunition against me by my enemies. But letting them go would make me look weak. What do you think would be a suitable punishment?” Lord Dimitri asks me in return.

“Possibly a golden statue that reaches all the way into the sky realm?” I answer earnestly.

Lord Dimitri chuckles as he responds, “Your devotion to me is appreciated but perhaps, considering their physique, perhaps construction of a new building in my name. Perhaps a luxury apartment compartment?”

I place my hand over my heart and bow as I answer, “Your foresight is amazing as you are generous my lord.”

The observer joins us in our conversation and states, “The case has been closed. Am I correct to understand that is the desired punishment?”

“Yes. Have them go forth and build a luxury apartment complex in my name. Send the paperwork to the usual place.” Lor Dimitri states.

“Very well, officers are on their way to collect the conscripted and the paperwork will be sent in the next load. Have a wonderful day, Lord Dimitri.”

Today feels like it’s going to be a wonderful day.

1phv1pt,https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/1phv1pt/things_ive_learned_after_moving_to_melbourne_vs/,Things I've learned after moving to Melbourne (vs Perth),"Moved to Melbourne at the ass end of COVID in 2021, literally going from no restrictions to a few months of lockdown before opening back up for good... It's been so interesting noticing all the differences in culture.

Note: These are just my experiences, I'm not saying these apply to everyone.

* When walking down the footpath, they are so much more oblivious to walking out of the way or making room for you, honestly, the amount of times I've had to jump out of the way at the last second is crazy (yes, I walk on the LHS)
* Saying ""Hi"" whilst walking past someone in Perth was always the norm (for me, anyway), I feel like I'm talking to myself 95% of the time here - it's a small thing, but it surprisingly makes you feel so less connected to your community.
* When I first moved to Melbourne, I was astounded with how many cars stopped for me to let me cross the road. I feel like if I ever got too used to this and went back to Perth, I'd get run over in a day.
* Food isn't that much better than anywhere else, there's just a ton more. It's like every suburb has a Vic Park strip that goes on forever, you can always find someone you're craving. The way to think about it is if they condensed Perth, but it's bigger... if that makes sense.
* As a Coffee snob, the coffee is definitely overrated. What I mean by that is that it is excellent, but you can find as good as the best of Melbourne in Perth, just as easy.
* A 22° day in Melbourne is the same as the 26-28 day in Perth (humidity).
* The extremely hot days in Melbourne are always overcast. If you're looking at the forecast and see a 28c day preceding a 36c day, plan to be outside on the 28c day if you want the sun and enjoy the evening outside. More often than not, the 36c day will be cloudy af and end with a cold front and rain.
* Four seasons in a day is legit. If you want to get outside and it's sunny, for the love of god get outside.
* The MCG is amazing! Honestly, as someone who loves their sport, the goosebumps I get every time I walk into a near capacity game of footy is unrivalled by anything else. Marvel Stadium though, while having really-good facilities and bars, I swear has a vampire in charge of the roof. Kind of makes me think they have a fear of the sun. It could be a perfect sunny day any day of the year, but they don't open it, no matter what...... Sorry, until it's a 38 degree day in peak summer, and you're sitting in the sun roasting and no one wants to sit in the sun because it will melt your face off.
* Melbourne call the foreshore of St Kilda a beach (i.e. they could happily say ""let's go to the beach"", but mean St Kilda). Even though it's still in the bay, the quality of the beach there is like you mixed the Swan River foreshore with a dash of heroin and meth. The day after I first went there, I checked the water quality... ""HAZARDOUS - DO NOT PUT YOUR HEAD UNDER THE WATER"". Bro.
* As someone who enjoys their cold showers in the morning, the cold water in Melbourne is insanely colder, in a good way (if you like that). In Perth, the cold water is like you stayed in a bath a little too long.
* I know this is just climate, but everything's is a lot greener in Melbourne, the parklands are beautiful, and it's so good walking around them. Whereas in Perth, It's all very dry and arid. As someone who appreciates the outdoors, the parklands in and around the city are so lush.
* Driving in Melbourne is considerably worse because the road quality is so shit. In some of the intersections that have tram lines on them, you need you pray you're following the correct lane. Not only that, some of the roads are an absolute clusterfuck of chaos. It's like they got high on mushrooms when designing them (See this: [maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4PuYBsimG6eeBrdU6)). So many main thoroughfares go through 40km strips, too.
* Another thing, their measure of distance / time is so different. It takes us 30-35 minutes to get from just South of the River to Joondalup up the freeway, but it takes 30 minutes to go a few suburbs across over here, but then when you say to do a day trip down to the coast (1.5hr - 1hr 45mins), it's like you're asking them to drive to the sun and back.
* Melbourne still loves smoking - there is basically a tobacconist for every 20 people. Every single strip, no matter how small, will have a tobacconist (which is basically a front for selling under-the-counter vapes).
* I stand by that Melbourne's café / art / food culture is so strong, because they needed to find other things to do to keep them busy while they couldn't go outside and enjoy the sun.

Other random things:

* They have no idea what a verge is.

Seriously, I told my partner to put the bin on the verge when I moved over. They have no idea what that word means. They call it a nature strip..... Heathens. I use this diagram to help them understand.

* Parmi vs Parma. I will forever die on the Parmi hill.
* Honkeynut vs Gum nut
* Milk bars vs General store / Deli
* Water fountain vs Bubbler
* Potato scallops vs potato cakes
* Middy v Pots. Honestly, A middy is half a pint. Why complicate that.
* Rockmelon vs Cantaloupe. We're not yanks.
* Polony vs Devon
* Apparently we say things like ""Neil"" with an extra syllable, ""Knee yal"", rather than a single.

With all that being said, Melbourne goes alright.",107,1765244907.0,perth,28,0.93,False

I’m after something real. Shared values, actual trust, long-term goals. Not into games, flings, or modern dating nonsense.

**About Me:** Music’s a big part of my life. I mostly listen to extreme metal, black and death metal stuff. Cradle of Filth is my favorite band, with Belphegor and Burzum right behind. I do vocals for fun and used to play with some guys (I have hit the drum set a couple times). Emperor's song With Strength I Burn probably has my favorite lyrics. You don’t have to love the music, but you’ll need to be okay with the sound, the shirts, and the wall art.

I work in IT, handling help desk support for the rest of the staff, and I’m starting to get into software security. I know tech pretty well but I don’t like to live online. I’ll scroll sometimes, but I’d rather be talking or watching something together than just sitting on our phones.

Been gaming since I was a kid. I’m into Dark Souls, Resident Evil, Timesplitters, and old Tony Hawk. Still down for Kirby or Mario Party with friends. I like board games that actually require some thought, like Betrayal at House on the Hill or HeroQuest. Other stuff I’m into: classic horror, building Gunpla kits, museums, occasional camping, and I’ve been slowly learning Japanese. I don’t drink, smoke, do drugs, or even bother with caffeine usually, not in a judgy way if you drink coffee (but in a judgy way of you smoke).

**What I’m Like:** Introverted at first but social once I’m comfortable. My humor’s usually dry, dark, or a little weird. People say I’m easy to talk to and usually pretty funny in person. I have a strong filter for quality, whether it’s people, ideas, or anything else in life. I don’t fake things and can come off as negative sometimes but that just amplifies the stuff I do like as genuine and not slop. I take relationships seriously. I’m not afraid of commitment, I just want it to be with the right person, someone I can actually build a life with. I’ll take care of the people I love. I’m reliable, loyal, and when I’m with someone, I’m all in.

**What I’m Looking For:** I want a serious relationship with someone who shares traditional values. Long-term, I want a dynamic where I provide and my partner takes care of the home and raises a family. If that sounds boring or outdated to you, we’re probably not a match. I’m looking for someone younger, ideally between 18 and 24, since I want a big family and the timeline matters. I’m most attracted to East Asian or white women with a slim or average build, obviously personality is king but we can’t deny that physical attraction matters. As such I’ve attached pics of me for you to judge.

**Dealbreakers:** tattoos, far-left politics, weed or drug use, heavy drinking, or being chronically online. If you’re into gaming, metal, horror, or nerd stuff, we’ll probably get along. I’m not expecting perfect. Just someone honest, loyal, and serious about building something real. You obviously don’t need to match me 100%, I’m open to trying new things (as long as I’m not doing substances) and hope you’re at least receptive to trying a board game or TCG.

Hoping for some help,"A little backstory: My husband and I are huge Packers fans from out of the country, like got married in Packers jerseys huge. This year we finally made our first trip to Lambeau, and honestly… we stood outside the stadium in silence and shed a tear. It was one of those “we finally made it” moments we will never forget. We even left Green Bay with an awesome Packers tattoo to commemorate the trip. 

But now I’m kicking myself over two things:

First, the Spotted Cow situation.

We fell completely in love with this beer while we were in Wisconsin and brought some home. We made a little tradition of treating ourselves to one Spotted Cow every game day and fun fact… the Packers have not lost a single game that we have cracked one open. The problem is that we are running dangerously low. I did not bring back enough and unless I jump on a plane there is no way to get it to Canada. That one hurts and is all on me. 

Second, the Cheesehead Cheese Star Christmas tree topper.

I regret this one even more. We saw it at the Pro Shop and I hesitated because I didn’t want to carry it around all day. By the time we went back (on our sixth visit, no joke), it was sold out. I have checked online every day since and it is still sold out. The $75 shipping to Canada should it come back in stock, also stings. 

These are two things we haven’t stopped talking about since we left and I would love to surprise my husband with one of them for Christmas. He’s so amazing and deserves it. I get the beer is out of the question so I am throwing this out to the community.
If anyone has the Cheesehead Cheese Star tree topper and would be willing to sell it to me I would be beyond grateful. I will cover everything including the cost, shipping, and I would happily send you gifts, beer, coffee, Canadian snacks (hello ketchup chips) or whatever you like as a thank you.

If you can help make this Packers themed Christmas complete, please let me know. Thank you so much for reading and Go Pack Go.

I look forward to seeing you all next week in the game day thread. 💚🫶🏼💛",2,1765244593.0,GreenBayPackers,8,0.6,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Tijuana, Mexico.","First off, **I’m not the one who got the transplant**. I went with my buddy to both of his procedures—one in Turkey and one in Mexico. I’m just sharing *his* experiences here, and if you have questions, I can ask him directly and get accurate answers.

My friend Mike and I went to **Dr. Serkan’s Hair Clinic in Istanbul, Turkey** in 2023, and Mike went back again on his own in 2024. We just recently returned from **The HAir Line Hair Clinic in Tijuana, Mexico**.

Mike received **5,000 grafts each time in Turkey**, and **2,500 grafts in TJ**.

* **Turkey:** $3,500 flat fee for up to 5,000 grafts (same price even if you need fewer).
* **Tijuana:** $2,000 flat fee for up to 5,000 grafts.

Both clinics were staffed mostly by Turkish doctors and transplant nurses. In TJ, the receptionist was Mexican, but the medical team was Turkish. Mike preferred the Istanbul experience—he said the clinic felt more luxurious and had more advanced equipment. For example, Turkey had a **head scanner** to determine the best donor areas, whereas in TJ it was based on the doctor’s judgment.

For pain management, Turkey gave him **liquid fentanyl, 0.5 mg Xanax, and lidocaine shots** when needed. In TJ, he only received **local anesthesia**.

As someone who accompanied him to both clinics, I also felt Istanbul was much more upscale. They had staff walking around offering tea and coffee to patients and visitors during the procedures.

Both clinics offered recommended hotel options.

* In TJ, the hotel was **right across the street** from the clinic.
* In Turkey, the hotel wasn’t close, but the clinic provided **shuttle service** to and from all appointments.

The experience in TJ, Mexico was easy and convenient.  We both had Global Entry and flew though border control.

I’ve also had a hard time catching my breath and night sweats have been worsening. I do have cervical angina, but these pains have been different and in different areas. I was due for my yearly cardiologist appt anyway. 

The nurse was super nice and listened. I was a few minutes late due to printing the PDFs of my abnormal EKG I recently had and my watch showing afib. Of course, I left them at home on the coffee table. I put everything else in my purse EXCEPT that. I offered to email them to the office staff, but no avail. 

I’m sure she told him what I said, but all he heard was, female patient feeling weird beats when she lays down. 🙄 She also did an EKG right there for 60 seconds and it was fine with no abnormalities. 

Doctor comes in and right away starts telling me how people focus more on their heart beat when they lie down. More so when they lie on their left side (I was on my left side when the afib showed on my watch). He said people tend to hear their beat in their ear and that can make it sound or feel abnormal. 

He tried to tell me that my watch showing afib was actually me not understanding what my heart beat can sound/feel like when I lie down. You can see the fucked up beats on the printout and I had an abnormal EKG from another doctor. And I just now remembered the local hospital has another abnormal EKG on file when I got admitted for a colitis flare early this year which was triggered by the flu vaccine, so that too. 

I never thought I’d feel so disregarded at a place I’d always felt heard. We are doing a 7 day halter, stress test, echo and chest ct soon, but god. He spent less than four minutes with me saying to cut back on caffeine (never said I drink caffeine, it was assumed) and the beats just sound/feel off sometimes. At least he ordered tests, which we previously agreed would be yearly due to my conditions. 

I waited almost two hours to see him. Next time, I’ll be sure to ask for the female in the office. It seems she’s the one who takes me seriously and he just signs off on it. I’ll definitely be taking the printouts to my next appt. 

Thanks for letting me vent. I know many of you have felt the same way and would understand. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this stuff who actually understands.  ",0,1765243893.0,ChronicPain,0,0.5,False
1phuo7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1phuo7x/how_i_fixed_a_memory_leak_in_2_minutes_that_would/,How I Fixed a Memory Leak in 2 Minutes (That Would Have Taken Hours with Android Studio Profiler),"# The Problem: A Production Memory Leak

Last week, I was debugging a critical production crash. Users were reporting `OutOfMemoryError` after using our app for about 10-15 minutes. The crash logs showed:

    java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Failed to allocate a 524288 byte allocation
    at com.example.myapp.MainActivity.onCreate(MainActivity.java:45)
    at android.app.Activity.performCreate(Activity.java:7136)
    at android.app.Activity.performCreate(Activity.java:7127)

**Classic memory leak symptoms:**

* App works fine initially
* Memory usage grows over time
* Eventually crashes with OOM
* Stack trace points to allocation failure, not the leak source

The stack trace was misleading—it only showed where we ran out of memory, not where the leak originated. This is the #1 challenge with memory leak debugging: **the crash location ≠ the leak location**.

# Understanding Memory Leaks in Android

Before diving into the solution, let's understand what we're dealing with:

**What is a memory leak?**

* An object that should be garbage collected but isn't
* Usually caused by holding references longer than needed
* Common causes: static references, listeners, handlers, inner classes

**Why are they hard to find?**

* No obvious error until OOM crash
* Memory grows slowly over time
* Stack traces don't point to the leak
* Need to analyze the entire object graph

# The Traditional Approach: Why It's So Painful

Normally, I would use Android Studio Profiler:

1. **Capture heap dump**: `adb shell am dumpheap` or use Profiler UI
2. **Wait for parsing**: For a 200MB+ dump, this can take 5-10 minutes
3. **Navigate dominator tree**: Find objects with high retained size
4. **Manually trace references**: Click through object references
5. **Guess the leak pattern**: Try to identify what's holding references
6. **Repeat**: If wrong, capture another dump and start over

**Problems with this approach:**

* ❌ **Slow**: JVM-based parsing is slow for large dumps
* ❌ **Freezes**: Complex object graphs can freeze the UI
* ❌ **Unclear**: Dominator tree doesn't show the leak path clearly
* ❌ **Time-consuming**: 1-2 hours per leak (if lucky)

**Real example from my experience:**

* 300MB heap dump took 8 minutes to parse
* Profiler UI froze when navigating large object graphs
* Had to restart Android Studio twice
* Finally found the leak after 90 minutes of manual tracing

# The New Approach: One-Click Dump & Analyze

I decided to try a different tool: **AndroidLeakTool** (a native macOS HPROF analyzer). The key difference? **It can dump and analyze in one click**.

# The One-Click Workflow

https://preview.redd.it/zaxx7iqxz26g1.png?width=1824&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce902594e2f0dea99e0321f174c4109f924de3cc

Instead of the multi-step process with Android Studio, AndroidLeakTool offers a **one-click solution**:

1. **Connect your device** (via ADB)
2. **Click ""Dump & Analyze""** in AndroidLeakTool
3. **Done!** The tool automatically:
   * Captures the heap dump from your device
   * Pulls it to your Mac
   * Parses the HPROF file
   * Analyzes for memory leaks
   * Shows you the leak path

**Total time: \~10 seconds** (including dump capture and analysis)

# Speed Comparison

|Step|Android Studio Profiler|AndroidLeakTool|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Capture dump|Manual ADB commands|✅ Automatic|
|Pull to Mac|Manual `adb pull`|✅ Automatic|
|Parse HPROF|3-5 minutes (200MB)|✅ **8 seconds**|
|Find leak|30-60 min manual tracing|✅ **Instant**|
|**Total**|**1-2 hours**|✅ **\~10 seconds**|

# What Happened When I Clicked ""Dump & Analyze""

I connected my device, selected the app package, and clicked the button. Here's what happened:

**0-2 seconds**: Tool captured heap dump via ADB  
**2-3 seconds**: Dump pulled to Mac automatically  
**3-11 seconds**: HPROF parsed (200MB file)  
**11 seconds**: **Leak detected and displayed!**

The entire process was **faster than making a cup of coffee**.

# Step 3: The Tool Found the Leak Path

The tool immediately highlighted a leak path with detailed information:

https://preview.redd.it/b4qwncc0036g1.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=16ba5f1914b80db9806670fb8b429dab217c93ad

**What this tells us:**

* **Exact leak path**: From MainActivity to the leaking objects
* **Memory impact**: 50MB+ retained (explains the OOM)
* **Root cause**: Static reference pattern
* **Fix suggestion**: Specific code changes needed

# Step 4: The Fix

The tool even suggested the exact fix:

    // ❌ BEFORE (Leaking)
    public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
        private static ViewHolder holder; // Static reference = memory leak!
        
        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            holder = new ViewHolder(); // This holds reference to Activity
            // ...
        }
    }
    
    // ✅ AFTER (Fixed)
    public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
        private ViewHolder holder; // Non-static
        
        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            holder = new ViewHolder();
            // ...
        }
        
        @Override
        protected void onDestroy() {
            super.onDestroy();
            holder = null; // Clear reference
        }
    }

# The Results

* **Time to find the leak**: 5 minutes (vs. 1-2 hours)
* **Time to fix**: 2 minutes
* **Total debugging time**: 7 minutes

The app now runs smoothly without memory issues.

# Why This Tool Made a Difference

1. **Speed**: Native parsing is 3x faster than JVM-based tools
2. **Clarity**: It shows the exact leak path, not just a confusing dominator tree
3. **Actionable**: It tells you *how* to fix it, not just *where* the leak is

# Deep Dive: Understanding This Memory Leak

# The Leak Pattern: Static Context Reference

This was a classic **""static reference to context""** leak pattern. Here's what happened:

    // The problematic code
    public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
        private static ViewHolder holder; // ⚠️ STATIC = LIFETIME = APP LIFETIME
        
        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            holder = new ViewHolder(this); // Holds reference to Activity
            // ...
        }
    }

**Why this causes a leak:**

1. **Static lifetime**: `static` variables live for the entire app lifecycle
2. **Context reference**: `ViewHolder` holds a reference to `MainActivity` (Context)
3. **Activity can't be GC'd**: Even when Activity is destroyed, static reference keeps it alive
4. **Cascading effect**: Activity holds all its views, adapters, and data
5. **Memory accumulates**: Each Activity recreation adds more memory that can't be freed

**Memory growth over time:**

    Launch 1: MainActivity (15MB) → static holder → Adapter (8MB) → Data (50MB) = 73MB
    Launch 2: Another 73MB (can't GC previous) = 146MB total
    Launch 3: Another 73MB = 219MB total
    ... eventually OOM

# Why Android Studio Profiler Struggled

1. **JVM overhead**:
   * Profiler runs in JVM, parsing HPROF through Java APIs
   * Each object access goes through multiple layers
   * For 200MB+ dumps, this creates significant overhead
2. **UI complexity**:
   * Must render entire object graph in UI
   * Complex graphs (1000+ objects) can freeze the interface
   * Memory-intensive operations compete with UI thread
3. **Dominator tree limitations**:
   * Shows ""what retains memory"" but not ""why it's retained""
   * Doesn't highlight common leak patterns
   * Requires manual interpretation

# Why Native Parsing Helped

1. **Direct memory access**:
   * Native code reads HPROF format directly
   * No JVM overhead or object wrapping
   * Optimized C/C++ algorithms for parsing
2. **Pattern recognition**:
   * Pre-configured detection for common leak patterns:
      * Static context references
      * Handler leaks
      * Listener leaks
      * Inner class leaks
   * Automatically highlights suspicious paths
3. **Focused output**:
   * Shows only leak paths, not entire object graph
   * Clear visualization of reference chains
   * Actionable fix suggestions

# Other Common Memory Leak Patterns

While we fixed a static reference leak, here are other patterns to watch for:

**1. Handler Leaks:**

    // ❌ Leaking
    private Handler handler = new Handler() {
        @Override
        public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
            // Handler holds implicit reference to outer class
        }
    };
    
    // ✅ Fixed
    private static class MyHandler extends Handler {
        private final WeakReference<Activity> activityRef;
        MyHandler(Activity activity) {
            activityRef = new WeakReference<>(activity);
        }
    }

**2. Listener Leaks:**

    // ❌ Leaking
    someObject.setListener(this); // Never removed
    
    // ✅ Fixed
    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        someObject.removeListener(this);
    }

**3. Inner Class Leaks:**

    // ❌ Leaking
    private class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        // Holds implicit reference to outer Activity
    }
    
    // ✅ Fixed
    private static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        private final WeakReference<Activity> activityRef;
    }

# Tools I Used

* **AndroidLeakTool**: [https://androidleaktool.com/](https://androidleaktool.com/?utm_source=reddit=social&utm_campaign=case_study)
   * Native macOS HPROF analyzer
   * **One-click dump & analyze** feature
   * Automatic ADB integration
   * Fast native parsing engine
* **Android Studio**: For implementing the fix (the only step that still requires manual work)

# Lessons Learned: Memory Leak Debugging Best Practices

1. **Static references are dangerous in Android**:
   * `static` variables live for app lifetime
   * Never hold Context/Activity in static fields
   * Use WeakReference if static is necessary
   * Always clear static references when done
2. **Use the right tools for the job**:
   * LeakCanary: Great for detecting leaks in dev builds
   * Android Studio Profiler: Good for general profiling
   * Specialized tools: Better for production dumps and deep analysis
   * Sometimes a focused tool beats a general-purpose one
3. **Time is money**:
   * Memory leaks can take hours to debug manually
   * Faster tools = more time for feature development
   * ROI: $9.99 tool saves 1-2 hours per leak = pays for itself quickly
4. **Prevention is better than cure**:
   * Use LeakCanary in development
   * Code reviews: Watch for static references, listeners, handlers
   * Regular memory profiling: Catch leaks before production
5. **Understand the leak pattern**:
   * Not all leaks are the same
   * Different patterns require different fixes
   * Tools that explain the pattern save debugging time

# Common Questions About Memory Leaks

**Q: Why not just use LeakCanary?**  
A: LeakCanary is amazing for development! But it requires code changes and can't analyze production dumps. My tool is for analyzing HPROF files from production crashes or when you can't modify the code.

**Q: Can it detect all types of leaks?**  
A: It detects common patterns (static references, handlers, listeners, inner classes). For edge cases, you might need to manually trace, but it still speeds up the process significantly.

**Q: What about Kotlin coroutines leaks?**  
A: Coroutine leaks usually show up as Job/CoroutineScope references. The tool can detect these, but you need to understand coroutine lifecycle to fix them properly.

**Q: How do I capture a heap dump from production?**  
A: With AndroidLeakTool, it's automatic! Just connect your device via ADB and click ""Dump & Analyze"". The tool handles everything. For production devices, you might need developer options enabled, but no root required.

**Q: Is the one-click feature really that fast?**  
A: Yes! For a typical 200MB dump, the entire process (capture + pull + parse + analyze) takes about 10 seconds. The native parsing engine is significantly faster than JVM-based tools.

**Q: Is this better than Android Studio Profiler?**  
A: For large dumps (200MB+), yes—it's faster and shows clearer leak paths. For small dumps, both work, but this tool provides actionable fix suggestions.

1phullp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1phullp/the_first_snowfall/,The First Snowfall,"I watched the snow fall for the first time this year today and thought about how delicate and silent the snow hit the ground. Then I thought about us and how much it feels like us — delicate and silent. We don’t talk much anymore and that is okay. I used to sit in the home we shared and wait up, not leave the house, etc. because I thought you would come back, but you never did (except for three days). So now I sit here with no expectations of you because I gave up. 

I walked our dog tonight with the snow falling and, per usual, she acts like you are in every car that we pass because she still wants you to come home, as bad as I always wanted you to. I think about the first snowfall we shared in our first place together and how I ran to the bathroom while you were in the shower to scream “it’s coming down!!” You jumped out and we watched together as I drank my pre-work coffee. Did you think about that moment as you watched the snow today? 

I know you suppress your emotions, lie to me about them, and have difficulty expressing them. That’s okay because one day, you might scream the truth at me. Who knows? 

I sit here with the fireplace on and wonder if you thought about me and our peaceful moments while you felt the snow land on your face?",1,1765243674.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1phuiym,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phuiym,Various teas?!,"These are all from places in Philly BTW


1) Walnut Cafe unsweet matcha
Nice grassy bitter flavor


2) Haraz dirty matcha with pistachio
This one was bitter and then sweet finish since I don't mix my drinks.


3) Haraz unsweetened Chai
The milk they used was super creamy which molded out the chai by a lot.


4) Molly Tea unsweet jasmine with matcha cream and pistachios topping
Again milky with sweet matcha finish that works great with the pistachios. It's interesting and def something I never even thought to do before I came to this place.


5) I genuinely wish I could remember where this was but it's a legit coffee and taco place. Unsweetened matcha was good, but also the hot cacao is the bomb.


6) Molly Tea unsweetened peach oolong with jasmine pecan cream
The peach Oolong is nice but not particularly pungent the way you may expect Oolong. I think that's partly the A2 milk. Ddf get these unsweetened if you're looking to drink something more like actual tea.",1,1765243465.0,tea,1,1.0,False

1phuhxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Individual-girl/comments/1phuhxg/a_flurry_of_words/,A flurry of words,"Friday was their first “real” day at karate. And then they now have it every Tu/Fi but I need to check if they will go this week cuz I haven’t actually paid for the class yet. I only paid registration and for all the gear. I mean it was$150 each soooo not cheap, but man I’ve never seen them more into something. And that’s saying a lot because they are not girls of little words. 

The monthly class charges start in January. But the studio seems to be really small and their class only has a few kids in it, so I actually think they like having the girls. It gives them someone to show off to/practice on. 

I really don’t know where the karate love came from. ESPECIALLY M. R it tracks. She loves being sporty and “awesome”. K though has been quite the surprise. I just brought them one day because I was getting coffee and there was a class going on and I was like why not, and I dunno what it was about it… they were just transfixed. 

I’m doing hello fresh and no real favorite meals yet, except I do love a good homemade mashed potato side. I forget how each it is to make just a few servings of good mashed potatoes. For some reason I buy a whole bag of potatoes and convince myself the only way to make them is to labor over the stove. I’ve been enjoying the meal kits for that exact reason. Teaching myself how to make a meal for 2. One for now one for tomorrow. Instead of a meal for 4. Two for now two for later. (Which is what most of my cooking background was doing). And you know me. I don’t stick to the recipe 😂 it’s more of a suggested guideline. 

Listen Trey. I can feel your panic through that message. Let’s just both take a bit of a cold shower. We are both very intelligent people. We’ve gotta figure out a way to … I dunno.. exist in each others lives but without… danger. I dunno what I’m even wishing. 

Are we addicts to each other? Pulled in when we know there’s only pain that comes out the other side? But also… how can such.. connection just be.. for nothing. 

Anyways that’s a lot. God I have so much to say and literally no time to say it.

Core flex? 8-12 “life phases” lined up cron-style on a beefy horizontal timeline smack in the middle – kiddo era with baby fat and 90s scrunchies, prime boss mode in power suits, down to silver fox wrinkles and legacy drip. All hyper-real 3D at 8k, zooming on skin glow-down from smooth AF to battle-scarred vibes, outfits evolving from playground rags to red carpet slay.
Canvas? Deep [vibe color, like emerald for artists or navy for pols] textured bg – old-school parchment or velvet city, ghosted with faded love letters, squiggly sigs, OG headlines (“DIVORCE DRAMA!” smh), and doodles of their big W’s. Title blasts at the top in snooty serif font, all elegant n shit.
The chaos layer? Info DUMP central for that “bio nerd heaven” look – skinny white lines spiderwebbing from quirks like [their scars/glasses/gadgets/medals/fabrics] to tiny text blobs and floaty nodes everywhere. Hover zones for era breakdowns, icons popping world events (Vietnam flashbacks or iPhone drops tying into their arc). Random circle zooms in blanks for macro madness – gnarly hand textures from grind/art hustle, eye iris secrets, or that ring/pen/watch they never ditched.
Footer strip? Quick hits: DOB/DOD, hometowns, peak banger (album drop or invention), legacy #’s (Grammys stacked or companies birthed). Tech? Octane glow-up, UE5 polish, editorial layout boss, volumetric lights, pin-sharp focus, pro color grade, cinematic dusk drama. –ar 16:9 –v 6.0 –stylize 300

It was a normal day until tanks surrounded our house. Soldiers broke in, pointed guns at us, beat us, and forced us to leave to Rafah. They told us if we came back, they would kill us. Then they blew up our home. Everything we had, everything we built, gone in seconds. We had no choice but to leave with nothing.

We escaped to Egypt and stayed there for a few months. If you don't know, Egypt charges $5,000 USD for each person who crosses the border. Our family of seven paid $35,000 USD, that's about $50,000 CAD. That's crazy expensive, but it was our only way out. Even then, we only got visitor visas, not permission to stay permanently. We needed to find a country where we could live legally and rebuild our lives.

Canada was the only country that helped us. I want to say this clearly, we came here as temporary residents and we support ourselves financially. We're not refugees but we really appreciate that the government gave us free visas, work permits, and health insurance. That generosity gave us the chance to start building a new life.

From the first day in Montreal, everything felt different. Nobody called me a foreigner here. Everyone just says ""Welcome to Montreal,"" and those simple words meant everything to us. We live in DDO now and it's a nice area. The city is beautiful, the nature, the buildings, everything. People are friendly, the food is great, and honestly, people here are very good looking. I've traveled to many countries and I was surprised by this.

One thing that really touches my heart is that Montreal reminds me of Gaza. Not Gaza during the war, but the Gaza I loved before everything happened. The summer weather, the blue sky, the good energy, it feels like home. Even the cloudy winter skies remind me of Gaza, though in a sad way. They look like the dark skies during the bombing. I know that sounds strange, but it's how I feel.

I've been to other cities in Canada, but Montreal is special. The French culture and French buildings are beautiful. When you walk through these neighborhoods, it feels like you're in a different country. Being here makes me want to learn French. I feel connected to this city. It's becoming part of my life.

But not everything is easy. Back in Gaza, it was simple to meet your neighbors and become friends. People would knock on your door, invite you for coffee, or just hang out together. Here, it's different. Many neighbors don't make eye contact. When I say ""good morning,"" most people don't say it back the next time I see them. Only some older people stop to chat and are friendly. I miss that feeling of community and connection. Maybe it's just a cultural difference I need to get used to, or maybe I haven't found the right places to meet people yet. But I'm hopeful it will get better with time.

I'm sharing this because I'm grateful. Montreal has given me hope when I thought I had lost everything. I want to learn French, make this city my home, and build a good life here.

To everyone in Montreal who has been kind to us, thank you. You've helped us more than you know.",572,1765243079.0,montreal,137,0.85,False

He is alone when the bomb goes off.

One moment the street is full of voices and motion, a busy market road caught in the heat of midafternoon. Women calling out as kids dart between stalls, vendors haggling over a sale. The next moment, there is only the blurred white of it all.

The blast eats all sound first.

Air slams out of his chest. The world turns to pressure and dust. He doesn’t remember falling, only the taste of grit and burned metal as he pushes himself up, ears ringing, rifle useless weight against his shoulder.

The street is wrong now.

It is bent and twisted, color burned out of it. Tiny glass shards glitter in the air like hanging stars, catching weak sunlight pushing through the thickness of dust. The wheel of a riderless moped spins slowly in the middle of the road. A plastic bag flutters from a shattered awning. A single sandal lies in a pool of darkened viscera where the wearer once stood. The pieces of the market and the area it occupied lay scattered before him like a horrifying mosaic of destruction. 

He doesn’t look too closely at anything. He’s learned not to. He keeps his eyes on shapes, not details. Movement, not faces.

“…zero, report! Status!” Screams through the static of a radio but the voice is small, distant. His own name disappears into the whine inside his skull. His body moves slowly, instinctively, before his mind can process. His boots crunch through broken stone and glass as he moves toward the epicenter of the shockwave.

The dread builds with every step, thickening with the dust.

There is something in the street ahead. Small. Distorted. Outlined in the settling haze.

He doesn’t reach scene before the world pulls away from him like water down a drain.

He wakes sideways, halfway off his mattress, choking on the air that still smells like burned plastic.

His hand is already on the pistol.

His fingers know the weight of it before his eyes open. Cold metal, familiar patterns in the stippling of the grip. The slide, the safety. It comes up with him in a single panicked motion, barrel sweeping the dark of the room as his chest hammers.

The only light spills forward in a cone of crimson red from his flashlight, jittering in his shaking hand as he paints the walls in a blood colored wash. 
Closet. 
Door. 
Cracked ceiling. 
The cheap dresser that came with the apartment. 
The open bathroom door, a rectangle of deeper shadow.

Something stands there.

Just inside the threshold, half a head shorter than him at the shoulder. A silhouette cut out of the dark, edges soft, like smoke trying to hold a human shape. No eyes he can see, no mouth. Just a small, upright absence against the black of the bathroom.

The flashlight slips in his grip. For a second the beam shakes off the shape and when it finds it again, the thing is closer. Two steps inside the room now. The air feels thicker, heavier, caught between his lungs and his throat.

“ No… no, no, no…”

He squeezes his eyes shut, teeth clenched, the words hissed through them like a prayer and a curse at once. The pistol, pressed against his temple now, hard enough to hurt, hand shaking so badly the metal feels like it’s tapping against his skull.

He drags a breath in through his nose, holds it, counts.

“One…Two…Three.”

He opens his eyes.

The room is empty. Just the open bathroom door, the pale shape of the tub, the faint red smear of his own light sliding across tile.

He lowers the pistol slowly to his lap, the tremor in his hand lingering as it rests there. He stares at it for a long second, and only when the shaking in his hand grows to a chatter in his teeth does finally get out of bed.

He gets dressed in the dark. Shirt, jeans, boots left unlaced. The apartment feels too small, the walls too close, the ceiling too low. The air in here has gone flat with his breathing.

He has to get out.

The building doors breathe him out onto cracked pavement. The street outside is thinner, colder, but too bright. Hanging amber street lamps stain everything with a sour orange glow, and the sky above the city glows faintly with distant light pollution.

He walks.

Hands jammed deep into his pockets, shoulders rounded, head down. Every person he passes registers in his periphery: height, gait, distance, clothing, what they’re carrying, but he doesn’t look anyone in the eye. He watches their hands instead. Watches where their feet land.

He steps wide around a torn garbage bag, out into the street to avoid a cluster of bottles and paper near the curb. He knows it’s trash. Knows it isn’t anything more than that. But he still won’t walk over it.

His gaze keeps sliding to the gutters, to the gloomy mouths of storm drains, to anything that could hide metal and hate beneath it.

His mind hasn’t come to terms with the difference between here and there.

A car turns the corner ahead of him, tires hissing on wet asphalt as he slowly shifts his walk away from the street closer to the wall of the building. The vehicle rolls lazily along, music a low thump inside. When it reaches the intersection, the front wheel hits a sunken iron grate.

CLANG.

The sound is sharp and instant, metal on metal, a note that doesn’t belong to this place echoes in the hollow of his chest.

He is against the wall before thought catches up.

Shoulder slamming brick, knees bending, a crouch that’s been etched into muscle memory. His hand is on the pistol inside his waistband, his knuckles achingly white against the grip. The sound of him breathing has vanished, replaced by a high, buzzing quiet.

The city blurs at the edges.

For a second the street is full of hanging dust again, the lamps smeared into tiny suns behind it. The faint music from the car smears into distant shouting. Somewhere, far away, somebody is screaming a name he knows.

And from the wavering darkness ahead, something small steps out onto the sidewalk.

The same silhouette that was in the bathroom doorway stoically leers in front of him. Limbs vaguely human, edges flowing, as if it were made of steam and shadow instead of skin. It moves toward him without sound, drifting more than walking, a smear of deeper black against the dimming city street.

He can hear it. Not with his ears but somewhere further back, in the place where memory and noise blend together. A kind of humming cry, pitched high, trembling. It isn’t words. It’s the sound of pain stretched thin.

His thumb finds the safety.

“Stay away,” he breathes. His voice comes out as a rasp that barely clears his throat. Louder, forcing it: “Stay the fuck away from me!”

The humming grows louder, burrowing down behind his eyes. His vision pinholes. His grip tightens on the pistol until his fingers go numb.

“Leave me alone!” he shouts, squeezing his eyes shut.

When he opens them again the street has snapped back.

No dust. No smoke. Just the glow of streetlights and a paper cup tumbling along the curb. A man is standing a few yards away, startled, hands half raised like he’s not sure if the situation calls for help or distance.

“You okay man?” The stranger asks.

The man blinks. The brick wall against his back. The pistol is halfway drawn from his waistband, coat pulled tight around it. He can’t remember if he’s already spoken or just thought he did.

He backpedals, boots scraping the sidewalk.

“Hey, man, you okay? You…” the stranger says, taking a half-step forward.

The voice splinters. One shard is the man’s concern, ordinary and awkward. The other is a wail over a radio, clipped words, somebody yelling for a medic. The two sounds braid together as he turns quickly away from the stranger and runs.

Pavement slaps under his boots, but in every other stride it’s not pavement. It’s rubble, jagged and uneven, dust kicking up in small clouds with each footfall. Buildings loom on either side of him, brick and glass, then blasted concrete with rebar bones showing through. The night hum of the city becomes a low roar of engines and distantly spaced booms.

He doesn’t look back.

He doesn’t remember unlocking his door. Only slamming it behind him and twisting the deadbolt like his life depends on it.

The apartment’s usual smell of coffee and cleaning spray blends with that of burning wood and the taste of copper on his tongue. It feels wrong. Untrustworthy.

He moves on autopilot, clearing the every space and room with the pistol out, firmly gripped in his hands. He checks the tiny kitchen, the cramped hallway, the bathroom where the silhouette first stood. The bedroom, light still on from earlier, sheets twisted, darkened still by his sweat. 

Empty. Of everything except him.

He drags a chair away from the wall and sets it where he can see every doorway. The angle gives him a view of the front door, the kitchen entrance, the hall. The lamp by the door is on. The overhead in the bedroom spills a rectangle of light onto the carpet. The kitchen’s little dome light hums above an empty table. 

He kills the living room light and sits down in the dark.

The pistol rests on his thigh, his hand over it. His back finds the wall. His breathing does not want to slow down.

The bedroom light flickers.

Just a little. A hiccup in the power. The bulb dims for a heartbeat, then flares back, and in that split second of dimming, the light doesn’t look like a bulb anymore. It looks like muzzle flash that punches short, vicious bursts into the frame of the open door. He hears the chatter of automatic fire layered over the hum of the building.

He squeezes the pistol, eyes locked on that doorway.

The lamp near the front door brightens, its glow pushing hot and white along the floor. And with that brightness comes the distant, muffled sound of people screaming. A compressed mass of voices from somewhere he thought he’d left behind.

His heart crawls into his throat. Every muscle aches from being held too tight.

He keeps the weapon pointed low but ready, sliding his aim from doorway to doorway, corners, thresholds. Somewhere in the building someone drops something heavy, and the dull thud arrives in his chest as more than sound.

The kitchen light begins to flicker.

Not on and off. It sputters in place, a stuttering static buzz growing under the glass. The air beneath it ripples.

Something coalesces there.

At first it’s just darkness that refuses to move with the rest of the shadows when the light jumps. Then it thickens. Becomes a small shape standing between the stove and the table, not quite touching the floor. Edges flowing, smoke clinging together in the outline of a narrow body, narrow shoulders, a head that tilts slightly to one side.

He swings the pistol toward it.

The thing doesn’t flinch.

Its presence presses against his skin like humidity, a weight that isn’t physical but feels heavier than any body armor he’s ever worn. The static hum from the light crackles louder, crawling along the back of his neck.

“Leave me alone.” His voice barely seems to disturb the air.

The silhouette takes one slow, gliding step forward. The humming cry rises out of it again, not from a mouth but from the space it occupies, thin and sharp and endless.

He chokes on the next breath.

“Go away,” he says, the words coming out raw. “Please. Please just go.”

The arm of the shadow, if that’s what it is, lifts. It’s more suggestion than limb, a dark reach that stretches up toward the flickering light above it.

“Stop,” he says, louder now, standing without meaning to. His legs are shaking. The gun’s barrel wavers. “Stop, stop—”

The silhouette’s reaching hand meets the light.

Every bulb in the apartment goes out at once.

His shout tears out of his throat and hangs in the sudden black, where that humming cry becomes the ringing echo of the explosion again.

He is back in the street.

Smoke curls around burned-out cars and broken concrete. Fires dance here and there, licking at scraps of cloth and plastic. The shock of the blast has been replaced by an awful quiet that the world hasn’t earned.

He walks forward because he did then and because he can’t do anything else now.

Muzzle flashes strobe somewhere behind the smoke, far enough away that they function like lightning inside a storm. Voices bark orders, but the words are washed out, important only in the way they say: this is not over, this is not safe.

His boots move through dust and rubble. Every piece of twisted metal underfoot, every fragment of glass, feels like a decision he didn’t make fast enough.

He reaches the center of the blast.

The stall that used to be here is gone. The awning is blown half off, fabric charred, sagging over the street like something exhausted. A small shoe lies on its side in the middle of the road, the cartoon character on the side scorched past recognition.

A body lies a few feet away.

Small. A child. Curled slightly onto its side, one arm thrown forward. Clothes burned away to colorless rags, skin darkened by heat and soot. The hair is singed close to the scalp. The face…

He doesn’t want to look, but his gaze rises anyway.
And then he sees the face, the burned shadow he carried home with him and never outran.

The eyes are open. They are not accusing. They are not anything. They’re just empty, staring up at him through a film of ash. The small hand stretched toward him, fingers curled, seemingly reaching for his boots.

Sound drains out of his head. Even the distant gunfire goes thin, pushed to the edges by the roaring silence that fills the space where his heart is supposed to be.

He stands there a long time. Long enough that someone, somewhere, calls his name. Long enough that the smoke that moved around him settles, dusting his uniform.

He stands there.
He doesn’t move.
He doesn’t blink.
He doesn’t look away.

He comes back sitting on the floor of his apartment, the wall solid against his spine.

The pistol is in his hands, muzzle pointed somewhere near his own chest, elbows resting on his knees. His fingers have gone numb around the grip.

The lights are back on.

Bedroom bulb steady. Lamp by the door casting a quiet pool of yellow. Kitchen light humming softly, innocent, like nothing ever happened. 

The silhouette remains. 

Closer now. More defined. The outline of a child just at the age where the world should have been simple. There are no features to see, no details, but he feels them anyway. The burned fabric. The char of skin. The emptiness in the eyes.

His cheeks are wet. He hadn’t noticed when he started crying.

“I’m sorry,” he whispers.

The words snag in his throat. It takes effort to get them out.

“I’m sorry. I’m… I couldn’t…” He trails off, breath hitching. The tears come harder. It feels like something in his chest is dismantling piece by piece from the inside.

The shadow doesn’t move. Doesn’t reach. It just stands there, as if bearing witness.

“Please,” he says. Now it’s barely voice at all, just sound. “Please go. Please let me go.”

There is no answer. Only the hum of the refrigerator, the distant plumbing clank of a neighbor using water, a muffled television through a wall. Ordinary building sounds, wrapped around the thud of his own heart.

His right hand tightens on the gun.

His left comes up to meet it, habit and training taking over where thought has given out. The weight settles into both palms, familiar and final.

For a moment he just sits there, slightly rocking. Every inhale feels like pulling wire into his lungs. Every exhale like giving something up he can’t get back.

Across the room, the shape remains.

There are no more words. No more bargains to make with the thing in front of him or with the memory behind it. Just the quiet decision in the space where everything else has gone and worn thin.

The apartment breathes around him, unaware and unchanged. Down the hall, someone laughs faintly at something on TV. Pipes murmur. The building holds its breath.

His fingers find their place.

He draws one last breath.

He closes his eyes.

The silhouette.
The form.
The memory.
The regret…remains.
Stands, silent…
…and watches.

“In the end, the tenant of 5C lies still, the war inside him finally collapsing into a silence even his memories cannot cross. There is no final battle, no last stand, only the dim quiet that follows a life fighting too long against thoughts that refuse to loosen their grip. The building absorbs what remains of him and adds his name to its ledger, one more entry written in the margins of grief. Next week, we ascend to Unit 4D, where another tenant searches for an answer he should never have looked for. In that room, truth waits like a patient predator.”

At around April last year I got my bloods done and discovered my ferritin was at 4ug/L, which resulted in me receiving an iron infusion. this year i got my bloods done again as my symptoms never improved. My ferritin was around 30ug/L this time around, so i got another infusion in October - this time with more iron. I think its ferinject. After that, I got my bloods done again recently as my symptoms still have not improved. Still waiting on results.

Throughout all of last year and this year I have constantly been fatigued. I cant even get out of bed most of the time, and it makes it really difficult to function. last year i was in year 12 and i would get very painful headaches daily. These headaches were typically worse when i was exposed to certain lighting in class. I am at university now and the headaches still have not stopped. for reference i am 19 years old. I also experience dizziness quite often at random times throughout the day, in addition to experiencing it when moving my head too fast. I also experience muscle aches, and generally just find myself feeling really sh\*\*. I also have trouble sleeping. Most nights it takes me hours to fall asleep. Not because my mind is restless and anxious - my mind is exhausted and empty, i simply just cannot fall asleep.

My main concern is the fatigue though. I have so much to do and study, but i am just so f'ing exhausted. I cant stop crying from the exhaustion. Not sad - just tired. I cant even walk around without feeling like i need to sit down and have a nap. My skin is also weirdly itchy. No marks like dermatitis - just itchy. Gets worse if i sit on different textiles. also bloat really easy, obsessive anxiety, get brain fog sometimes, and shortness of breath whenever i work out/walk/run.

in terms of my diet and lifestyle habits: i eat a really varied diet. I eat red meat and fish regularly and also consume foods rich with vit C. Also started taking folate tablets. I try to wake up at 5:40 every morning and be in bed by 9pm, which involves me reading before bed to try and calm my mind in hopes of helping me sleep. I also do not drink coffee and instead drink matcha regularly - starting this year. i do not drink any caffeine in the afternoon.

For some background:  
19 year old female  
been consistently taking a low dose of isotretinoin (accutane)  
on micronelle pill 150/30 (BC)  
diagnosed PCOS and assumed endometriosis by doctors (have not gotten laparoscopy to be sure)  
hypothyroidism has been running in the family for three known generations  
endometriosis runs in family also.

Initially the low iron was a result of constant heavy menstrual bleeding that would occur for extended times outside of usual cycle. This has since been rectified as I have been on the pill since early last year. No clue what is causing this iron deficiency, or if it is indicative of a different problem.

So far bloods have not shown anything abnormal except for my ferritin. My THS levels are normal but doctors are refusing to still test my T3 and T4 - even though this was what happened to my dad (normal THS and abnormal T3 T4). He has diagnosed hypothyroidism. Doctor also advised me to try meditation..? Obviously is that worked i would have tried a long time ago. And melatonin, for which she did not end up providing a prescription for? (In Australia prescription required for under 55 years). Also advised me to try some other bs thing that I cant remember.

On the bloods i recently got done I am waiting for results from also testing ESR (i think its that one - something that measures inflammation to test for autoimmune).

I really just want to find out what's wrong with me so i can function like a normal 19 year old. Anyone experienced similar or might have any advice on what tests would be worth getting done? I really, really appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this. Thank you.",1,1765242994.0,cfs,4,1.0,False

Shooting pivot game.
From the first minute, my mark decides to camp in the low post, leaving me COMPLETELY alone on the perimeter. I could literally make myself a coffee before shooting.
For three entire quarters, my team:
Does not read the mismatch
I don't get the ball
Keep forcing absurd entries
Ignore that there is a “wide open center” every play
It's frustrating because it was SUCH an obvious adjustment that the opposing defense was basically telling us:
“We don’t trust this team to know how to punish an open three-pointer.”
And for 15 minutes, they were right.
In the last quarter, when we were already down, my teammates finally started to see me. They pass me the ball, I punish the mismatch, we open the court and we come back.
We won by 3… but it was an easy +20 game if they had read the game from the beginning.
It was like winning without the team knowing how they did it.

📌 Match 2 — Ego, chaos, internal fights and a point guard who is dedicated to sabotage
This is where the circus begins.
The base:
Does not organize
Strength shots
Everything fails
He doesn't understand rhythm, spacing or anything
The escort, seeing the disaster, assumes the role of creator. Until then, normal. But then he PACKS: he goes into permanent ISO mode, scores 40 points but doesn't give a single assist, ignores cuts, transitions, everything.
Base and escort start fighting.
Meaningless downtime.
Bad decisions.
Egos everywhere.
And just when he thought it couldn't get any worse... the point guard begins to sabotage on purpose:
He stays in his own field to provoke techniques
He shoots from court to court every time he receives
Annoys every possession
He doesn't leave the game because he wants to keep fucking
In the end the game expelled him for a bad grade in the last quarter... but the damage had already been done.
We were basically playing 4v5 against the opponent + our own point guard.
It was impossible to win like that.

📌 Conclusion
Match 1:
We won a game that should have been a blowout, but it took three quarters for my team to see an obvious imbalance.
Match 2:
We lost because a point guard decided to destroy the game instead of playing it, and a guard forgot that basketball is a team sport.

The wheel of a riderless moped spins slowly in the middle of the road. A plastic bag flutters from a shattered awning. A single sandal lies in a pool of darkened viscera where the wearer once stood. The pieces of the market and the area it occupied lay scattered before him like a horrifying mosaic of destruction. 

He doesn’t look too closely at anything. He’s learned not to. He keeps his eyes on shapes, not details. Movement, not faces.

“…zero, report! Status!” Screams through the static of a radio but the voice is small, distant. His own name disappears into the whine inside his skull. His body moves slowly, instinctively, before his mind can process. His boots crunch through broken stone and glass as he moves toward the epicenter of the shockwave.

The dread builds with every step, thickening with the dust.

There is something in the street ahead. Small. Distorted. Outlined in the settling haze.

He doesn’t reach scene before the world pulls away from him like water down a drain.

He wakes sideways, halfway off his mattress, choking on the air that still smells like burned plastic.

His hand is already on the pistol.

His fingers know the weight of it before his eyes open. Cold metal, familiar patterns in the stippling of the grip. The slide, the safety. It comes up with him in a single panicked motion, barrel sweeping the dark of the room as his chest hammers.

The only light spills forward in a cone of crimson red from his flashlight, jittering in his shaking hand as he paints the walls in a blood colored wash. 
Closet. 
Door. 
Cracked ceiling. 
The cheap dresser that came with the apartment. 
The open bathroom door, a rectangle of deeper shadow.

Something stands there.

Just inside the threshold, half a head shorter than him at the shoulder. A silhouette cut out of the dark, edges soft, like smoke trying to hold a human shape. No eyes he can see, no mouth. Just a small, upright absence against the black of the bathroom.

The flashlight slips in his grip. For a second the beam shakes off the shape and when it finds it again, the thing is closer. Two steps inside the room now. The air feels thicker, heavier, caught between his lungs and his throat.

“ No… no, no, no…”

He squeezes his eyes shut, teeth clenched, the words hissed through them like a prayer and a curse at once. The pistol, pressed against his temple now, hard enough to hurt, hand shaking so badly the metal feels like it’s tapping against his skull.

He drags a breath in through his nose, holds it, counts.

“One…Two…Three.”

He opens his eyes.

The room is empty. Just the open bathroom door, the pale shape of the tub, the faint red smear of his own light sliding across tile.

He lowers the pistol slowly to his lap, the tremor in his hand lingering as it rests there. He stares at it for a long second, and only when the shaking in his hand grows to a chatter in his teeth does finally get out of bed.

He gets dressed in the dark. Shirt, jeans, boots left unlaced. The apartment feels too small, the walls too close, the ceiling too low. The air in here has gone flat with his breathing.

He has to get out.

The building doors breathe him out onto cracked pavement. The street outside is thinner, colder, but too bright. Hanging amber street lamps stain everything with a sour orange glow, and the sky above the city glows faintly with distant light pollution.

He walks.

Hands jammed deep into his pockets, shoulders rounded, head down. Every person he passes registers in his periphery: height, gait, distance, clothing, what they’re carrying, but he doesn’t look anyone in the eye. He watches their hands instead. Watches where their feet land.

He steps wide around a torn garbage bag, out into the street to avoid a cluster of bottles and paper near the curb. He knows it’s trash. Knows it isn’t anything more than that. But he still won’t walk over it.

His gaze keeps sliding to the gutters, to the gloomy mouths of storm drains, to anything that could hide metal and hate beneath it.

His mind hasn’t come to terms with the difference between here and there.

A car turns the corner ahead of him, tires hissing on wet asphalt as he slowly shifts his walk away from the street closer to the wall of the building. The vehicle rolls lazily along, music a low thump inside. When it reaches the intersection, the front wheel hits a sunken iron grate.

CLANG.

The sound is sharp and instant, metal on metal, a note that doesn’t belong to this place echoes in the hollow of his chest.

He is against the wall before thought catches up.

Shoulder slamming brick, knees bending, a crouch that’s been etched into muscle memory. His hand is on the pistol inside his waistband, his knuckles achingly white against the grip. The sound of him breathing has vanished, replaced by a high, buzzing quiet.

The city blurs at the edges.

For a second the street is full of hanging dust again, the lamps smeared into tiny suns behind it. The faint music from the car smears into distant shouting. Somewhere, far away, somebody is screaming a name he knows.

And from the wavering darkness ahead, something small steps out onto the sidewalk.

The same silhouette that was in the bathroom doorway stoically leers in front of him. Limbs vaguely human, edges flowing, as if it were made of steam and shadow instead of skin. It moves toward him without sound, drifting more than walking, a smear of deeper black against the dimming city street.

He can hear it. Not with his ears but somewhere further back, in the place where memory and noise blend together. A kind of humming cry, pitched high, trembling. It isn’t words. It’s the sound of pain stretched thin.

His thumb finds the safety.

“Stay away,” he breathes. His voice comes out as a rasp that barely clears his throat. Louder, forcing it: “Stay the fuck away from me!”

The humming grows louder, burrowing down behind his eyes. His vision pinholes. His grip tightens on the pistol until his fingers go numb.

“Leave me alone!” he shouts, squeezing his eyes shut.

When he opens them again the street has snapped back.

No dust. No smoke. Just the glow of streetlights and a paper cup tumbling along the curb. A man is standing a few yards away, startled, hands half raised like he’s not sure if the situation calls for help or distance.

“You okay man?” The stranger asks.

The man blinks. The brick wall against his back. The pistol is halfway drawn from his waistband, coat pulled tight around it. He can’t remember if he’s already spoken or just thought he did.

He backpedals, boots scraping the sidewalk.

“Hey, man, you okay? You…” the stranger says, taking a half-step forward.

The voice splinters. One shard is the man’s concern, ordinary and awkward. The other is a wail over a radio, clipped words, somebody yelling for a medic. The two sounds braid together as he turns quickly away from the stranger and runs.

Pavement slaps under his boots, but in every other stride it’s not pavement. It’s rubble, jagged and uneven, dust kicking up in small clouds with each footfall. Buildings loom on either side of him, brick and glass, then blasted concrete with rebar bones showing through. The night hum of the city becomes a low roar of engines and distantly spaced booms.

He doesn’t look back.

He doesn’t remember unlocking his door. Only slamming it behind him and twisting the deadbolt like his life depends on it.

The apartment’s usual smell of coffee and cleaning spray blends with that of burning wood and the taste of copper on his tongue. It feels wrong. Untrustworthy.

He moves on autopilot, clearing the every space and room with the pistol out, firmly gripped in his hands. He checks the tiny kitchen, the cramped hallway, the bathroom where the silhouette first stood. The bedroom, light still on from earlier, sheets twisted, darkened still by his sweat. 

Empty. Of everything except him.

He drags a chair away from the wall and sets it where he can see every doorway. The angle gives him a view of the front door, the kitchen entrance, the hall. The lamp by the door is on. The overhead in the bedroom spills a rectangle of light onto the carpet. The kitchen’s little dome light hums above an empty table. 

He kills the living room light and sits down in the dark.

The pistol rests on his thigh, his hand over it. His back finds the wall. His breathing does not want to slow down.

The bedroom light flickers.

Just a little. A hiccup in the power. The bulb dims for a heartbeat, then flares back, and in that split second of dimming, the light doesn’t look like a bulb anymore. It looks like muzzle flash that punches short, vicious bursts into the frame of the open door. He hears the chatter of automatic fire layered over the hum of the building.

He squeezes the pistol, eyes locked on that doorway.

The lamp near the front door brightens, its glow pushing hot and white along the floor. And with that brightness comes the distant, muffled sound of people screaming. A compressed mass of voices from somewhere he thought he’d left behind.

His heart crawls into his throat. Every muscle aches from being held too tight.

He keeps the weapon pointed low but ready, sliding his aim from doorway to doorway, corners, thresholds. Somewhere in the building someone drops something heavy, and the dull thud arrives in his chest as more than sound.

The kitchen light begins to flicker.

Not on and off. It sputters in place, a stuttering static buzz growing under the glass. The air beneath it ripples.

Something coalesces there.

At first it’s just darkness that refuses to move with the rest of the shadows when the light jumps. Then it thickens. Becomes a small shape standing between the stove and the table, not quite touching the floor. Edges flowing, smoke clinging together in the outline of a narrow body, narrow shoulders, a head that tilts slightly to one side.

He swings the pistol toward it.

The thing doesn’t flinch.

Its presence presses against his skin like humidity, a weight that isn’t physical but feels heavier than any body armor he’s ever worn. The static hum from the light crackles louder, crawling along the back of his neck.

“Leave me alone.” His voice barely seems to disturb the air.

The silhouette takes one slow, gliding step forward. The humming cry rises out of it again, not from a mouth but from the space it occupies, thin and sharp and endless.

He chokes on the next breath.

“Go away,” he says, the words coming out raw. “Please. Please just go.”

The arm of the shadow, if that’s what it is, lifts. It’s more suggestion than limb, a dark reach that stretches up toward the flickering light above it.

“Stop,” he says, louder now, standing without meaning to. His legs are shaking. The gun’s barrel wavers. “Stop, stop—”

The silhouette’s reaching hand meets the light.

Every bulb in the apartment goes out at once.

His shout tears out of his throat and hangs in the sudden black, where that humming cry becomes the ringing echo of the explosion again.

He is back in the street.

Smoke curls around burned-out cars and broken concrete. Fires dance here and there, licking at scraps of cloth and plastic. The shock of the blast has been replaced by an awful quiet that the world hasn’t earned.

He walks forward because he did then and because he can’t do anything else now.

Muzzle flashes strobe somewhere behind the smoke, far enough away that they function like lightning inside a storm. Voices bark orders, but the words are washed out, important only in the way they say: this is not over, this is not safe.

His boots move through dust and rubble. Every piece of twisted metal underfoot, every fragment of glass, feels like a decision he didn’t make fast enough.

He reaches the center of the blast.

The stall that used to be here is gone. The awning is blown half off, fabric charred, sagging over the street like something exhausted. A small shoe lies on its side in the middle of the road, the cartoon character on the side scorched past recognition.

A body lies a few feet away.

Small. A child. Curled slightly onto its side, one arm thrown forward. Clothes burned away to colorless rags, skin darkened by heat and soot. The hair is singed close to the scalp. The face…

He doesn’t want to look, but his gaze rises anyway.
And then he sees the face, the burned shadow he carried home with him and never outran.

The eyes are open. They are not accusing. They are not anything. They’re just empty, staring up at him through a film of ash. The small hand stretched toward him, fingers curled, seemingly reaching for his boots.

Sound drains out of his head. Even the distant gunfire goes thin, pushed to the edges by the roaring silence that fills the space where his heart is supposed to be.

He stands there a long time. Long enough that someone, somewhere, calls his name. Long enough that the smoke that moved around him settles, dusting his uniform.

He stands there.
He doesn’t move.
He doesn’t blink.
He doesn’t look away.

He comes back sitting on the floor of his apartment, the wall solid against his spine.

The pistol is in his hands, muzzle pointed somewhere near his own chest, elbows resting on his knees. His fingers have gone numb around the grip.

The lights are back on.

Bedroom bulb steady. Lamp by the door casting a quiet pool of yellow. Kitchen light humming softly, innocent, like nothing ever happened. 

The silhouette remains. 

Closer now. More defined. The outline of a child just at the age where the world should have been simple. There are no features to see, no details, but he feels them anyway. The burned fabric. The char of skin. The emptiness in the eyes.

His cheeks are wet. He hadn’t noticed when he started crying.

“I’m sorry,” he whispers.

The words snag in his throat. It takes effort to get them out.

“I’m sorry. I’m… I couldn’t…” He trails off, breath hitching. The tears come harder. It feels like something in his chest is dismantling piece by piece from the inside.

The shadow doesn’t move. Doesn’t reach. It just stands there, as if bearing witness.

“Please,” he says. Now it’s barely voice at all, just sound. “Please go. Please let me go.”

There is no answer. Only the hum of the refrigerator, the distant plumbing clank of a neighbor using water, a muffled television through a wall. Ordinary building sounds, wrapped around the thud of his own heart.

His right hand tightens on the gun.

His left comes up to meet it, habit and training taking over where thought has given out. The weight settles into both palms, familiar and final.

For a moment he just sits there, slightly rocking. Every inhale feels like pulling wire into his lungs. Every exhale like giving something up he can’t get back.

Across the room, the shape remains.

There are no more words. No more bargains to make with the thing in front of him or with the memory behind it. Just the quiet decision in the space where everything else has gone and worn thin.

The apartment breathes around him, unaware and unchanged. Down the hall, someone laughs faintly at something on TV. Pipes murmur. The building holds its breath.

His fingers find their place.

He draws one last breath.

He closes his eyes.

The silhouette.
The form.
The memory.
The regret…remains.
Stands, silent…
…and watches.

“In the end, the tenant of 5C lies still, the war inside him finally collapsing into a silence even his memories cannot cross. There is no final battle, no last stand, only the dim quiet that follows a life fighting too long against thoughts that refuse to loosen their grip. The building absorbs what remains of him and adds his name to its ledger, one more entry written in the margins of grief. Next week, we ascend to Unit 4D, where another tenant searches for an answer he should never have looked for. In that room, truth waits like a patient predator.”

“Some tenants carry their past like luggage, others drag it like a corpse that never stops whispering. Behind the door of 5C lives a man who survived the violence, but the injuries he brought home still bleed in the dark. His silence is a minefield, his memories the shrapnel. Inside 5C, the battlefield was gone, but the war remained. And here, every shadow is armed to the teeth, not with weapons, but with the horrors that shaped them.”

-5C-

He is alone when the bomb goes off.

One moment the street is full of voices and motion, a busy market road caught in the heat of midafternoon. Women calling out as kids dart between stalls, vendors haggling over a sale. The next moment, there is only the blurred white of it all.

The blast eats all sound first.

Air slams out of his chest. The world turns to pressure and dust. He doesn’t remember falling, only the taste of grit and burned metal as he pushes himself up, ears ringing, rifle useless weight against his shoulder.

The street is wrong now.

It is bent and twisted, color burned out of it. Tiny glass shards glitter in the air like hanging stars, catching weak sunlight pushing through the thickness of dust. The wheel of a riderless moped spins slowly in the middle of the road. A plastic bag flutters from a shattered awning. A single sandal lies in a pool of darkened viscera where the wearer once stood. The pieces of the market and the area it occupied lay scattered before him like a horrifying mosaic of destruction. 

He doesn’t look too closely at anything. He’s learned not to. He keeps his eyes on shapes, not details. Movement, not faces.

“…zero, report! Status!” Screams through the static of a radio but the voice is small, distant. His own name disappears into the whine inside his skull. His body moves slowly, instinctively, before his mind can process. His boots crunch through broken stone and glass as he moves toward the epicenter of the shockwave.

The dread builds with every step, thickening with the dust.

There is something in the street ahead. Small. Distorted. Outlined in the settling haze.

He doesn’t reach scene before the world pulls away from him like water down a drain.

He wakes sideways, halfway off his mattress, choking on the air that still smells like burned plastic.

His hand is already on the pistol.

His fingers know the weight of it before his eyes open. Cold metal, familiar patterns in the stippling of the grip. The slide, the safety. It comes up with him in a single panicked motion, barrel sweeping the dark of the room as his chest hammers.

The only light spills forward in a cone of crimson red from his flashlight, jittering in his shaking hand as he paints the walls in a blood colored wash. 
Closet. 
Door. 
Cracked ceiling. 
The cheap dresser that came with the apartment. 
The open bathroom door, a rectangle of deeper shadow.

Something stands there.

Just inside the threshold, half a head shorter than him at the shoulder. A silhouette cut out of the dark, edges soft, like smoke trying to hold a human shape. No eyes he can see, no mouth. Just a small, upright absence against the black of the bathroom.

The flashlight slips in his grip. For a second the beam shakes off the shape and when it finds it again, the thing is closer. Two steps inside the room now. The air feels thicker, heavier, caught between his lungs and his throat.

“ No… no, no, no…”

He squeezes his eyes shut, teeth clenched, the words hissed through them like a prayer and a curse at once. The pistol, pressed against his temple now, hard enough to hurt, hand shaking so badly the metal feels like it’s tapping against his skull.

He drags a breath in through his nose, holds it, counts.

“One…Two…Three.”

He opens his eyes.

The room is empty. Just the open bathroom door, the pale shape of the tub, the faint red smear of his own light sliding across tile.

He lowers the pistol slowly to his lap, the tremor in his hand lingering as it rests there. He stares at it for a long second, and only when the shaking in his hand grows to a chatter in his teeth does finally get out of bed.

He gets dressed in the dark. Shirt, jeans, boots left unlaced. The apartment feels too small, the walls too close, the ceiling too low. The air in here has gone flat with his breathing.

He has to get out.

The building doors breathe him out onto cracked pavement. The street outside is thinner, colder, but too bright. Hanging amber street lamps stain everything with a sour orange glow, and the sky above the city glows faintly with distant light pollution.

He walks.

Hands jammed deep into his pockets, shoulders rounded, head down. Every person he passes registers in his periphery: height, gait, distance, clothing, what they’re carrying, but he doesn’t look anyone in the eye. He watches their hands instead. Watches where their feet land.

He steps wide around a torn garbage bag, out into the street to avoid a cluster of bottles and paper near the curb. He knows it’s trash. Knows it isn’t anything more than that. But he still won’t walk over it.

His gaze keeps sliding to the gutters, to the gloomy mouths of storm drains, to anything that could hide metal and hate beneath it.

His mind hasn’t come to terms with the difference between here and there.

A car turns the corner ahead of him, tires hissing on wet asphalt as he slowly shifts his walk away from the street closer to the wall of the building. The vehicle rolls lazily along, music a low thump inside. When it reaches the intersection, the front wheel hits a sunken iron grate.

CLANG.

The sound is sharp and instant, metal on metal, a note that doesn’t belong to this place echoes in the hollow of his chest.

He is against the wall before thought catches up.

Shoulder slamming brick, knees bending, a crouch that’s been etched into muscle memory. His hand is on the pistol inside his waistband, his knuckles achingly white against the grip. The sound of him breathing has vanished, replaced by a high, buzzing quiet.

The city blurs at the edges.

For a second the street is full of hanging dust again, the lamps smeared into tiny suns behind it. The faint music from the car smears into distant shouting. Somewhere, far away, somebody is screaming a name he knows.

And from the wavering darkness ahead, something small steps out onto the sidewalk.

The same silhouette that was in the bathroom doorway stoically leers in front of him. Limbs vaguely human, edges flowing, as if it were made of steam and shadow instead of skin. It moves toward him without sound, drifting more than walking, a smear of deeper black against the dimming city street.

He can hear it. Not with his ears but somewhere further back, in the place where memory and noise blend together. A kind of humming cry, pitched high, trembling. It isn’t words. It’s the sound of pain stretched thin.

His thumb finds the safety.

“Stay away,” he breathes. His voice comes out as a rasp that barely clears his throat. Louder, forcing it: “Stay the fuck away from me!”

The humming grows louder, burrowing down behind his eyes. His vision pinholes. His grip tightens on the pistol until his fingers go numb.

“Leave me alone!” he shouts, squeezing his eyes shut.

When he opens them again the street has snapped back.

No dust. No smoke. Just the glow of streetlights and a paper cup tumbling along the curb. A man is standing a few yards away, startled, hands half raised like he’s not sure if the situation calls for help or distance.

“You okay man?” The stranger asks.

The man blinks. The brick wall against his back. The pistol is halfway drawn from his waistband, coat pulled tight around it. He can’t remember if he’s already spoken or just thought he did.

He backpedals, boots scraping the sidewalk.

“Hey, man, you okay? You…” the stranger says, taking a half-step forward.

The voice splinters. One shard is the man’s concern, ordinary and awkward. The other is a wail over a radio, clipped words, somebody yelling for a medic. The two sounds braid together as he turns quickly away from the stranger and runs.

Pavement slaps under his boots, but in every other stride it’s not pavement. It’s rubble, jagged and uneven, dust kicking up in small clouds with each footfall. Buildings loom on either side of him, brick and glass, then blasted concrete with rebar bones showing through. The night hum of the city becomes a low roar of engines and distantly spaced booms.

He doesn’t look back.

He doesn’t remember unlocking his door. Only slamming it behind him and twisting the deadbolt like his life depends on it.

The apartment’s usual smell of coffee and cleaning spray blends with that of burning wood and the taste of copper on his tongue. It feels wrong. Untrustworthy.

He moves on autopilot, clearing the every space and room with the pistol out, firmly gripped in his hands. He checks the tiny kitchen, the cramped hallway, the bathroom where the silhouette first stood. The bedroom, light still on from earlier, sheets twisted, darkened still by his sweat. 

Empty. Of everything except him.

He drags a chair away from the wall and sets it where he can see every doorway. The angle gives him a view of the front door, the kitchen entrance, the hall. The lamp by the door is on. The overhead in the bedroom spills a rectangle of light onto the carpet. The kitchen’s little dome light hums above an empty table. 

He kills the living room light and sits down in the dark.

The pistol rests on his thigh, his hand over it. His back finds the wall. His breathing does not want to slow down.

The bedroom light flickers.

Just a little. A hiccup in the power. The bulb dims for a heartbeat, then flares back, and in that split second of dimming, the light doesn’t look like a bulb anymore. It looks like muzzle flash that punches short, vicious bursts into the frame of the open door. He hears the chatter of automatic fire layered over the hum of the building.

He squeezes the pistol, eyes locked on that doorway.

The lamp near the front door brightens, its glow pushing hot and white along the floor. And with that brightness comes the distant, muffled sound of people screaming. A compressed mass of voices from somewhere he thought he’d left behind.

His heart crawls into his throat. Every muscle aches from being held too tight.

He keeps the weapon pointed low but ready, sliding his aim from doorway to doorway, corners, thresholds. Somewhere in the building someone drops something heavy, and the dull thud arrives in his chest as more than sound.

The kitchen light begins to flicker.

Not on and off. It sputters in place, a stuttering static buzz growing under the glass. The air beneath it ripples.

Something coalesces there.

At first it’s just darkness that refuses to move with the rest of the shadows when the light jumps. Then it thickens. Becomes a small shape standing between the stove and the table, not quite touching the floor. Edges flowing, smoke clinging together in the outline of a narrow body, narrow shoulders, a head that tilts slightly to one side.

He swings the pistol toward it.

The thing doesn’t flinch.

Its presence presses against his skin like humidity, a weight that isn’t physical but feels heavier than any body armor he’s ever worn. The static hum from the light crackles louder, crawling along the back of his neck.

“Leave me alone.” His voice barely seems to disturb the air.

The silhouette takes one slow, gliding step forward. The humming cry rises out of it again, not from a mouth but from the space it occupies, thin and sharp and endless.

He chokes on the next breath.

“Go away,” he says, the words coming out raw. “Please. Please just go.”

The arm of the shadow, if that’s what it is, lifts. It’s more suggestion than limb, a dark reach that stretches up toward the flickering light above it.

“Stop,” he says, louder now, standing without meaning to. His legs are shaking. The gun’s barrel wavers. “Stop, stop—”

The silhouette’s reaching hand meets the light.

Every bulb in the apartment goes out at once.

His shout tears out of his throat and hangs in the sudden black, where that humming cry becomes the ringing echo of the explosion again.

He is back in the street.

Smoke curls around burned-out cars and broken concrete. Fires dance here and there, licking at scraps of cloth and plastic. The shock of the blast has been replaced by an awful quiet that the world hasn’t earned.

He walks forward because he did then and because he can’t do anything else now.

Muzzle flashes strobe somewhere behind the smoke, far enough away that they function like lightning inside a storm. Voices bark orders, but the words are washed out, important only in the way they say: this is not over, this is not safe.

His boots move through dust and rubble. Every piece of twisted metal underfoot, every fragment of glass, feels like a decision he didn’t make fast enough.

He reaches the center of the blast.

The stall that used to be here is gone. The awning is blown half off, fabric charred, sagging over the street like something exhausted. A small shoe lies on its side in the middle of the road, the cartoon character on the side scorched past recognition.

A body lies a few feet away.

Small. A child. Curled slightly onto its side, one arm thrown forward. Clothes burned away to colorless rags, skin darkened by heat and soot. The hair is singed close to the scalp. The face…

He doesn’t want to look, but his gaze rises anyway.
And then he sees the face, the burned shadow he carried home with him and never outran.

The eyes are open. They are not accusing. They are not anything. They’re just empty, staring up at him through a film of ash. The small hand stretched toward him, fingers curled, seemingly reaching for his boots.

Sound drains out of his head. Even the distant gunfire goes thin, pushed to the edges by the roaring silence that fills the space where his heart is supposed to be.

He stands there a long time. Long enough that someone, somewhere, calls his name. Long enough that the smoke that moved around him settles, dusting his uniform.

He stands there.
He doesn’t move.
He doesn’t blink.
He doesn’t look away.

He comes back sitting on the floor of his apartment, the wall solid against his spine.

The pistol is in his hands, muzzle pointed somewhere near his own chest, elbows resting on his knees. His fingers have gone numb around the grip.

The lights are back on.

Bedroom bulb steady. Lamp by the door casting a quiet pool of yellow. Kitchen light humming softly, innocent, like nothing ever happened. 

The silhouette remains. 

Closer now. More defined. The outline of a child just at the age where the world should have been simple. There are no features to see, no details, but he feels them anyway. The burned fabric. The char of skin. The emptiness in the eyes.

His cheeks are wet. He hadn’t noticed when he started crying.

“I’m sorry,” he whispers.

The words snag in his throat. It takes effort to get them out.

“I’m sorry. I’m… I couldn’t…” He trails off, breath hitching. The tears come harder. It feels like something in his chest is dismantling piece by piece from the inside.

The shadow doesn’t move. Doesn’t reach. It just stands there, as if bearing witness.

“Please,” he says. Now it’s barely voice at all, just sound. “Please go. Please let me go.”

There is no answer. Only the hum of the refrigerator, the distant plumbing clank of a neighbor using water, a muffled television through a wall. Ordinary building sounds, wrapped around the thud of his own heart.

His right hand tightens on the gun.

His left comes up to meet it, habit and training taking over where thought has given out. The weight settles into both palms, familiar and final.

For a moment he just sits there, slightly rocking. Every inhale feels like pulling wire into his lungs. Every exhale like giving something up he can’t get back.

Across the room, the shape remains.

There are no more words. No more bargains to make with the thing in front of him or with the memory behind it. Just the quiet decision in the space where everything else has gone and worn thin.

The apartment breathes around him, unaware and unchanged. Down the hall, someone laughs faintly at something on TV. Pipes murmur. The building holds its breath.

His fingers find their place.

He draws one last breath.

He closes his eyes.

The silhouette.
The form.
The memory.
The regret…remains.
Stands, silent…
…and watches.

“In the end, the tenant of 5C lies still, the war inside him finally collapsing into a silence even his memories cannot cross. There is no final battle, no last stand, only the dim quiet that follows a life fighting too long against thoughts that refuse to loosen their grip. The building absorbs what remains of him and adds his name to its ledger, one more entry written in the margins of grief. Next week, we ascend to Unit 4D, where another tenant searches for an answer he should never have looked for. In that room, truth waits like a patient predator.”
