1gkrloy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Lawyers/comments/1gkrloy/reopening_the_investigation_of_my_mothers_passing/,Reopening the investigation of my mothers passing for wrongful death,"Reopening the investigation of my mothers passing for wrongful death.

Good evening reddit. I'm going to TRY to keep this very professional and to the point. There are alot of circumstances, evidence, and time passed in this case since it happened in 2014. ‼️🚨PLEASE READ AND PLEASE POINT ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF HOW TO PROCEED WITH THIS🚨‼️

So, on 08/19/2014 my mother died in our home in Cartersville GA. At the time, me and my siblings were at school and it was her and my step dad at the house. My step dad raised me since I was a baby and even adopted me. When we got off the bus and we were rushed next door to the neighbors house as firetrucks, cops, and other emergency medical personnel arrived. My step dad was frantic and in tears and we were all just in shock.

At the time I was 16, my youngest brother was 12, my sister was 14, and our oldest brother was 23. Safe to say a VERY traumatic event to happen at that time and at those ages.

When I was a boy and only 16 alot of the truth about my mom's death were kept from me and also alot of dark family secrets as well. For one, my mom was hooked on pain pills during the final stages of her life. She was red flagged at the hospital even for purposely admitting herself to the ER to attempt to get pain meds prescriptions for her pain she had in her side/liver area. 

After my mother's sudden and unexpected passing, our step dad assured us we would stay in GA and regroup as a family and get through it all together. Not even a week later, he asks us to all come home and said we were moving to Ohio where his family is all from.

So we move to Ohio and my mom (who HATED Ohio and my step dad's family) was cremated at a funeral home in wellston Ohio. 

The night of, prior, or after my mother's passing (I can't really remember exactly) my step dad got drunk and slept with my mom's best friend who lived in wellston Ohio. This is confirmed by the entire family. And from then on, went on a fucking spree and would just constantly be trying to sleep with all the women he could.

One day, when I was using my step dad's phone to text my wrestling group chat about an upcoming tournament, I saw messages between him and my sister and WITH MY OWN EYES saw where he was inviting her to his room late in the night, telling her to remove her bra and not to sleep with a pillow in-between them anymore. I flipped and told my oldest brother and he didn't believe me and said I was overreacting. Nothing came of this. 

Fast forwarding to now and the NEW Information I have and that has came to light. First, this man flaunts how he was in the US Air Force and always on veterans day posts his head shot pic from basic and the family hero-fies him for his service. Recently I discovered that he was DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED after barley a year in service for sexual harassment/misconduct with a female airman. 
(I am currently in the works of obtaining this information and legal document stating this.)

My uncle, my cousin, my aunt, and other various family members have contested about his perverted and molesting behaviors over the years.
(I'm actively working on getting statements from ALL of them) 

REWINDING A BIT. As I stated, my mom was addicted to pain pills toward her final days. My parents were toxic and fought alot growing up and the relationship was not good. My mom suffered from bipolar disorder and a horrible childhood trauma and also being rapped as a young girl-teen. 

When my mom would abuse pain pills she would often times become unconscious from them. My family told me that my mom reached out to them that he was sexual molesting her when she was unconscious during this time. She also told her therapist this(I'm actively trying to find this therapist and track him down) 

My step dad was then put in charge of MONITORING her dosage and intake since she was abusing it. The day she died the police, coreners office, forensics all labeled it as a OD and no signs of foul play. 

HOWEVER, My mom was found in the bathroom floor with 2 black eyes, marks on her wrists/back arms/hands, and a dent in her forehead. (I have the autopsy reports) She was believed to be dead at the scene and was sitting on the toilet at the time of death. (Pee in the toilet as well) 

Of course, my uncle's and family members questioned my step dad about what really happened and he stated he found her like that and called the police immediately. 

They even pressured him to take a polygram test since if he was innocent it shouldn't matter and he would have nothing to hide. He denied and threatened legal reprocussions for harassment if they didn't leave him alone about it. 

My oldest brother believes, my step dad laced our mom's coffee, who she used to set out every night for the next morning with crushed up pills and that caused her to OD the day she died. 

Today, my older brother sent me a picture he received from a family that lived in the house after we moved out. The trim around the door entering the bathroom where she died has these words written on it ""I was raped and murdered in this bathroom please leave before it's too late"" 😵‍💫😖

Every hair on my body stood up when I saw this picture. Apparently the little boy who lived there wrote this but if he was so little I'm wondering how could he even reach the top of the door to do so. (Actively reaching out to the property/home owners to contact them on the validity of this story) I do have the picture of the door and the words written on it. 

MY QUESTION NOW IS!!! With all of this information (ITS ALOT I KNOW) HOW DO I PROCEED??? 

TD;LR Mom was murdered and raped by molesting and sick step dad back in 2014. New evidence and information has been revealed to me about his sexual predator ways including molesting my sister his daughter. I'm wanting to re-open the death investigation of my mom's death for wrongful death and have him prosecuted.

I work from home, Monday through Friday.  He is (at least currently) only off on weekdays.  My wife does not work.  We do not have kids.

My wife wants to bring him back to our house on these days when I am working, which I am both enthused about but accepting, but now she also wants him to spend the night here cause she doesn’t want to drive him home at night.  I said why don’t you just spend the night at his place, he lives alone.

I don’t even like friends and family in my house when I am working.  I would be fine if she spends the night as his place, but she wants him here.  I would also be fine if it was on weekends.  She has an overnight trip planned, I also don’t care.

I don’t really want overnights with my partners here in the first place, but if I do it won’t be when I have work the next day.  Though one wanted to so she could hang out with my wife the next day but I said.

I might feel more chill after I know her partner better, they have only been seeing each other a little over a month, I actually like the guy and all, we actually plan to hang out, I like my brother in law too and hang out with him, but I don’t wanna run into to either of them when I am making my morning coffee before work.

So I asked few other friends and I was told it's not that normal for how she's treating me  is beyond normal friends. But I just got to know from other co workers that she's still with her husband and  kids. I thought she has separated and lives alone. How did other coworkers know about her family while I still don't for the past 1 year? I am very hurt now. I thought we are moving forward but no, she's still happy with her family. I need to confront her soon but I have to risk a nice friendship. Or at least I can set expectations on how close we should be and remain friends but not as close. Maybe to her, what we were doing weren't close. But I dare to say she wouldn't tell her husband about me.

Help decipher if I am a friend or love interest? 

40male here and person in question is 40female.

Started out as co workers. I feel no crush nor any love interests in the beginning. We progressed into friends outside of work. But our quick coffee breaks or lunch were mostly within office hours. Once we went out outside of work to celebrate our birthdays and three occasions we just met for dinner elsewhere. Another time only the two of us went for a walk on a Saturday for a company fitness challenge.

What we did to each other:
I often text her end of day or morning just to say HI. One time we managed to meet up mid point and walk to office together.
She knew about my favorite waffle and drink and offered to buy me and placed in pantry fridge with my name on it. Out of the blue, she bought a almond drink for me. When I said I was injured she gave me some ointment on my table and another instance she wanted to send medicine to my home but I refused to give address. She jokingly said she could find out from the HR system as she's from HR. These were her sweet gestures and of course I did always offer to buy her coffee. She's also often feeling shy to come over my work desk.

December last year I bought a sleeping owl as a sleeping aid. She liked it as I noticed she couldn't sleep well. There are details I remember of her but I find she remembers more details about me than myself of her.

I know and feel she's hiding her marriage separation and also having a young kid. She's still legally married.

My feelings came when she initiated a farewell outing just me and her. It was such a nice outing walking the coast, a lunch date, and then a movie. She often joked about breaking off this friendship once I leave the company.

Recently, I video call her a few times during her solo trip. One thing shocked me was when I couldn't send her off at the airport, I initiated a video call at the airport. When time comes I chickened out (who am I to video call someone like this right?) but she immediately video called me and it was the best time of my life. Like out of so many friends why she accepted my offer to video call?

During her solo trip, she also send photos of herself inside and one casual selfie. I don't know if she sent it to her other friends. I also get to video call her and sort of accompanied her when she's alone somewhere during the trip. When I asked her about the trip or meal, she would send me photos of the place or food.

One day during her trip, she didn't reply me for half the day. I know she's safe. At night I managed to video call her when she's heading back to hotel. She said she was with an ex boss and kids the entire day. I told her I was worried for her.

The next day when she was on her way to airport, she texted me telling me how sweet I was to her and that she's sorry I was worried for her during her solo trip - referencing to that day she didn't reply my messages.

Question:
Is she just being nice to all her close friends or what? I don't dare to move forward for fear of ruining the friendship. Sometimes I am confused with her signals sometimes I feel her signals are just friends. Not much physical touch except one time she jokingly slapped my arm. I didn't dare to touch her in anyway as I am just enjoying this friendship and don't want to test the boundaries yet. Her farewell gift to me was a soft toy with a knitted sweater with my name on it. She also gave me a caricature she asked someone to draw during her solo trip. I am confused.",0,1730871585.0,relationship_advice,1,0.25,False

- Low Quality/Low Interaction/Unable to Troubleshoot 

- Average Outcomes depending on adherence to guidance and availability of advocate and claimant 

- Substantially above Average Claimant, warranting individual custom mentorship on a mutual agreeable schedule 

Quantity/ quality/explanation of information will all be dependent on the claimant type / user type. 

Some long-term users wiith long-term relationships have substantially improved eligibility outcomes over multiple years and multiple claims. Some are so advanced that they could be advocates for their individual eligibility issues that they have mastered.

Some long-term users do not want a custom approach, or circumstances otherwise prevent the commitment.

This necessitates a change in approach in the following ways 

- A reduction in overall individual moderator interaction on each post. Where the interaction is replaced with basic guides, until / unless the claimant demonstrates average or above average. 

- Improved guides for those who are average 

- A completely new and robust mentorship program for a select amount of claimants per week/per issue

The result will be a fairly stark contrast between the quantity and quality of information on certain posts compared to others; where uninvested or below average claimants are effectively transacting nearly useless or nearly counterproductive information. 

While other posts/users are getting custom information or requesting clarification on guides. 

To prevent notification swamping, this necessitates breaking interactions into two banks monitored by two completely separate accounts. 

This account will likely be in charge of individual moderation. Managing guides. Automation, administration. 

The main account will effectively be invite only and will be for above average users and mentorship programs for individual eligibility issues including initial eligibility and appeal prep, depending on availability and a variety of other factors. 

Response timelines between the two accounts will need to vary. 

Availability restrictions and open sessions will need to be published weekly. 

Weekly or recurring posts will need to appear in digests. Which will then necessitate guides for digests. 

The beginning of chat rooms for specific eligibility issue corrections has already begun. 

- For example; school attendance: misunderstanding the availability question has that of the nature of school, being at or above 12 credits in a baccalaureate or higher degree; how to correct.

- For Example: Training benefits application guide / FAQ. Doubling the total money a claimants could receive from unemployment is dependant on this one application. An appropriate level of care should be considered by the claimant in creating the application and understanding eligibility. 

- For example: Chat rooms or live sessions for groups who have similar job separation issues that necessitate some kind of an eligibility statement respective to the misconduct law. Tbd

1gkr72n,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gkr72n/transforming_small_spaces_the_best_furniture/,Transforming Small Spaces: The Best Furniture Choices for Compact Homes,"Living in a compact home doesn't mean sacrificing style or comfort. With the right furniture choices, even the tiniest spaces can be transformed into functional, stylish, and cozy retreats. Whether you're looking to revamp your living area, bedroom, or even balcony, there are creative solutions that make a big impact in small spaces. Here are some of the best furniture choices for making compact homes feel spacious, functional, and inviting.

**1. Multi-Functional Furniture: The Ultimate Space-Saver**

In a small space, every piece of furniture should serve a purpose—ideally, more than one! Multi-functional furniture like sofa beds, storage ottomans, and fold-out desks are perfect for compact homes. These pieces add versatility and functionality without overwhelming the room. For instance, a bed with built-in drawers or a coffee table that doubles as storage can keep clutter at bay while maximizing usable space.

**2. Slim and Sleek Sofas for a Cozy Living Room**

Bulky furniture can make a small living room feel cramped. Instead, opt for a sleek, slim-profile sofa that offers comfort without taking up too much space. Loveseats, compact sectionals, or armless sofas work beautifully in compact living areas. For additional seating, consider nesting stools or poufs, which can be stowed away when not in use.

**3. Extendable Dining Tables: Flexibility for Every Occasion**

An extendable dining table is a practical choice for compact dining areas. This allows you to accommodate guests when needed but keeps the footprint small for everyday use. Round tables also work well in small spaces, as they promote a flow around the room without sharp corners, giving the illusion of a more open space.

**4. Functional and Stylish Bedroom Solutions**

When it comes to small bedrooms, consider furniture that enhances functionality without overwhelming the room. Platform beds with drawers, for instance, are perfect for maximizing under-bed storage. Wall-mounted shelves or floating bedside tables can also free up floor space and add style to the room.

**5. Optimize Your Balcony with Outdoor Furniture**

If you're lucky enough to have a balcony, make it an extension of your indoor space with [outdoor furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) designed for compact areas. Look for foldable or stackable furniture pieces that can be stored away when not in use. [Balcony furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) like bistro sets or compact outdoor sofas can transform your balcony into a cozy nook for relaxation, while also adding charm to your outdoor space.

**6. Outdoor Benches: Stylish and Space-Saving Seating**

For those with small patios or terraces, [outdoor benches](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/rattan-benches) are a smart choice. They provide ample seating without taking up as much space as individual chairs. Plus, many outdoor benches come with hidden storage, which is ideal for keeping cushions, gardening tools, or other outdoor essentials. Benches with a slim profile can easily fit into narrow spaces, making them an excellent addition to compact outdoor areas.

**7. Vertical Storage: Making the Most of Wall Space**

When floor space is limited, think vertically. Wall-mounted shelves, pegboards, and floating cabinets help keep items organized while freeing up valuable floor area. Tall bookshelves or cabinets draw the eye upward, creating an illusion of height and openness.

**8. Minimalist Approach to Decor**

When decorating a small space, less is often more. Choose furniture and decor pieces with clean lines, light colors, and minimal patterns. Avoid heavy or overly ornate items, as they can make the space feel crowded. Opt for mirrors to create depth, and add a few well-chosen accessories to bring personality to the room without overwhelming it.

**9. Outdoor Furniture that Complements Indoor Decor**

If your indoor and outdoor spaces are close together, choose outdoor furniture that complements your indoor style. This helps create a seamless transition, making your space feel larger and more cohesive. For example, if your interior decor leans toward a natural aesthetic, go for outdoor benches and tables made from wood or wicker to maintain harmony throughout the home.

**10. Compact and Convertible Balcony Furniture**

Compact furniture designed for balconies can bring a whole new dimension to small spaces. Look for options that fold or have stackable components, such as chairs that tuck neatly under tables. Even the smallest balconies can be transformed into cozy retreats with the right balcony furniture—a small table, a pair of foldable chairs, and some plants can turn your balcony into a private oasis.

**Making a Big Impact in Small Spaces**

With strategic furniture choices, even the most compact home can be transformed into a comfortable, stylish, and functional space. Embrace multi-functional and space-saving solutions, and don’t be afraid to get creative with outdoor furniture that fits your balcony or terrace. By selecting the right pieces, you’ll create an inviting home where every inch serves a purpose and makes a statement.",1,1730871018.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

In previous blog, we talked about how the AI system help with generating cards. Today, let's change the topic and dive into the art design of our game! Card games are a visual feast as they require countless illustrations for each card. This workload is no joke, our art leader would have to drink all the coffee in the office to get through it, not to mention the rest of other art tasks. On the other hand, we want players to have that DIY fun, making each card their own piece of art. So, after many discussions, we decided to take a shot at using AI to generate cart art.

Dreams are nice, but reality bites... At first, the illustrations generated by the AI system were... well, let's say, not quite there. We fed it tons of materials, optimized algorithms, and designed art styles for different in-game skills. After a lot of trials and tribulations, and with designers pulling their hair out, we finally got the results we wanted.

Di naman kami nagaway, wala rin kami pagtatalo. When I asked her (parehas kaming girl) if galit ba sya sakin or disappointed or what, hindi naman daw. Pero alam mo ung may nagbago? Yung very cold, very casual na lang replies. And di na din kami talaga naguusap. 

Nabuo ung friendship namin online, kasagsagan ng pandemic. Pero we’ve met a lot of times na and naging close naman talaga kami. I love her like a sister. Kilala namin families ng isa’t isa at nakasama na din. 

What happened was, I was feeling so overwhelmed with my life to the point na ayaw ko makipagusap kahit kanino. Syempre iba ung family ko kasi wala naman ako choice kung hindi kausapin sila. Pero sa kanya, nagpaalam naman ako. Sabi ko mag-lie low muna ko so baka di ko muna sya ma-chat or ma-meet matagal. 

Sabay sabay ung stress ko sa work ko, problems sa family at finances at super down ako. Hindi ako makapagopen up sa kanya kasi feeling ko puro negativity mabibigay ko sknya. I know she has her own struggles too. Tapos na-meet ko pa ung ibang friends nya before all of this happened and realized na ung happiness na nabibigay nila sknya, like ung makasama sa gala, vacation, travel, inuman, mga date date, etc. is hindi ko maibigay sknya. (may own family na ko at mga anak) 

Mejo may age difference din kami, about 5 years.  So iba ung mga bonding moments namin, compred sknila. Feeling ko mas maganda na ung ibang friends nya kasama nya kasi mas happy sya. Kami coffee, kain ganun lang, madalas pa kasama anak ko. 

My cup is so empty and I feel like ang unfair if puro lang ako receive sknya at wala akong mabigay. 

Maregalo din syang tao, pero due to financial issues, di ko masuklian. So mejo nappressure din ako and I feel like I don’t deserve her. I also opened up about this sknya. Sabi nya, this wasn’t really an issue. 

So ayun nga. Nagpaalam ako na maglie down muna ko. Pero nung mejo feeling ko nasa better disposition ko in life, parang sya naman ung nawala. 

I’m not sure if kasalanan ko talaga. I was honest and all naman. I’m just so sad na I lost a friend. ",1,1730870233.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

So my newly ex-gf B (31f) cheated on me (29m) with J (30something m). 

B and I have known for a while that we have HPV. She is a chiropractor, and so has sworn the Hippocratic oath and everything. 

When she went and fucked J, she didn’t tell him that we have it. I don’t think she was going too. 

So I told him. He called me this morning and I explained the long and short with HPV. 

One thing he said on the phone was how he feels like we should report this to someone. “Like, she is a doctor.”

I have details, pictures, screenshots, the works. Just want some advice on what to do next. 

My angry reaction is put it all on blast on Facebook. Then report her to the board for it. 


*********************UPDATE #1 *********************


I went and got my tools (I’m own a contracting business) and some of my clothes today. I videoed everything, and had her sister and a mutual friend come by as well as my boy to help. 

I’m going to be staying at her Sisters for a few weeks to knock out the jobs I have here, and then I’m gonna pack up and head to my brothers a few states away. 

J and I are going to be getting some coffee in a few days to chat about it in person. I’m leaning toward at least reporting this to the board. He wants to report as well. I just asked him not to do anything until we talk. 

I’m still so angry, I want to report the commercial building codes that are being violated. 

I want to report the HIPPA violations that take place in her practice (such as sending people other peoples medical records). 

I want to put her on blast on Facebook and post the chats and (non-sexual) images with the dates stamps and everything.   (we live in a small town, and that’s the main thing out here). 

I want to send her practice invoices for the estimated 6-12k in work I have done on her building for free. 

I want to just burn it all. But, if I do, her sister who has been nothing but good to me, will also probably take a hit. 

So still trying to figure out what I’m going to do, but feeling much clearer. 


**************Update #2***************

First off, thank you all so much for your advice, and for your thoughts on the issues here. For anyone who wants to reach out, my DMs are open and I am trying to stay relatively active here. It’s been a kind of release to see a lot of the things that I feel so conflicted about come alive in the comments. This was my first ever Reddit post, so thanks everyone. 

My friends and family have also offered a plethora of places for me to go along with, “don’t worry man, you will have a job the second you get out here and I have a room you can crash in” in different ideations from a surprising amount of people. So I’m gonna be okay. 

Now, Enough with the sappy shit

For now, I have only really made one decision. Leave as soon as humanly possible. 

I leave either tomorrow night or the day after first thing in the morning. 

It’s an 18 hour drive to my little brothers, so i may be spotty on responses during that time. 

It’s time to rally the wagons here irl, just like y’all did here.

I saw them once when Covid restrictions lifted somewhat at the end of 2021–we met and had a coffee and caught up. I don’t know why, but I just couldn’t find the courage to formally break up. We just wasn’t a thing, we hardly spoke and didn’t see each other again in person and eventually stopped talking altogether. Enter my partner (29F) who has been in my life for years as a friend, but wanted to be friends with benefits. She knew I was with someone, but I was frank and said things weren’t going to last between us. We then slowly started to see one another casually, nothing with labels, it was largely friends with benefits. This would have been around November 2021. My partner began to feel bad about the blurred lines between the relationships, and would ask if it was over and I would say yes, because it felt like it was. 

Fast forward to 2023, me and my partner have had a lot of ups and downs. Shes ended our informal relationship several times. At one point openly said that she met someone at work she wanted to try things with and dropped me to pursue that. It fizzled out and she decided to travel instead, returning because she’d run out of cash in late 2023. We caught up and we slowly resumed where had been. Throughout this she’s always been clear that we are faithful to one another, if we want to pursue other people fine, but be open about it—I never did want to. Now it’s 2024, we were meant to meet to have a conversation about us and the future—it felt like things might actually become serious. But 30 minutes before the meeting she messaged to say she’d contacted my ex and couldn’t believe I’d lied (presumably about not formally ending things). I’m a bit puzzled how an ex relationship that ended in what felt like 2019 has somehow ended something that has been so informal since 2021. Am I being an idiot? Is this salvageable?

I recently purchased a secondhand breville bambino and smart grinder pro a few months ago. I was learning how to make espressos with the stock breville equipment and was starting to get some good results.

After watching a LOT of James Hoffman videos, I decided to upgrade some of my equipment by getting a normcore bottomless portafilter and IMS basket along with the WDT distributor tool and normcore tamper. 

The problem is since upgrading the equipment, I am not getting the aesthetic single drip of coffee coming from the portafilter. Instead I’m getting the main stream in the middle and a bunch of little spurts of coffee spraying everywhere. 

I’m assuming it’s channeling but I’m literally using the distributor tool for a good 1-2 min just to make sure everything is distributed correctly and minimize the possibilities of air pockets.

Is my puck prep just terrible? Or is there something else I could be doing wrong?

And we've known eachother for a while so it's not weird but I also don't just want to like give it to her in passing, I maybe wanna like go somewhere or do something and then give them the gift to make it a little more special/memorable. They arnt very social so they often don't go out much orlike crowded places but I know they really like getting out of the house with me, so I was thinking maybe like a coffee shop? But then I wouldn't want to disturb the other people there if i gave them the gift with like the unwraping sound etc etc. I guess I'm just asking if anyone has any ideas or advise on what I could do/ how to go about it (or what to write on the card) Thanks yall so much.

Some of y'all are taking Hal too literally as if he got an instant medical report, which would indeed be unrealistic.

But he could have just seen the prez rant and then clutch his chest and collapse. Given that it was mentioned that even a cup of coffee could give him a heart attack, it is very easy to see why Hal instantly went with the death conclusion.

Plus he has to act fast and get Kate to shut up before she says something career ruining to the woman who is probably the president at that moment.

Remember, even if the president faints and remains unconscious for 10 minutes, VEEP becomes acting prez for that period. The US can't be without a president even for a second.

Some of you wanted Hal to say ""Um Aktchually ☝️🤓 the president collapsed but he might be alive, I did not get his pulse but right now the woman you're shit talking is probably president.""

Smh and you really choose this hill to die on in the battle for realism when this is a show with genuinely unrealistic shit like:

1) VEEP having any power while the president is alive.
2) Kate being scouted for VEEP when she's inexperienced af and the sitting president is basically Joe Biden. (VP qualification reqs should skyrocket).

Hi everyone, 
Looking to hear some success stories to inspire me or tips.
I had a great LTR back home but I don’t  want to have kids and prioritize my work, travels and community/friendships. So I left my home country and been abroad for a decade, thinking I’d meet another person like me and we would have this lifestyle together. Turned out most expat men either don’t want to commit or looking for an Asian woman. While I’m not ready to move right now to find a man (passport/work/visa/finances), I’m willing to get out of my comfort zone and try to do the impossible and try to meet someone here, in Asia, in this transient temporary hub. 
I socialize almost daily and have many friends but I only meet other women. 
So, I’m moving away from nicer bars, art, yoga, book clubs, volunteering, music festivals and hikes. 
Can we compile a list of things/places/actions I should take? I’m willing to go as pro-active and crazy as I can. 
I’m ready to go out alone (I used to, I don’t mind but that’s usually not the type of guy who wants to commit)
I’m ready to start boxing, going to bars and chatting up men - what is the best type of a bar/event?
Can you comment and suggest things? I can do it all and report back.
Goal is to meet people. I already accepted I won’t meet anyone and continue living this life of travel and friendships but I still cry sometimes in my flat alone missing cuddles and having someone to wake up with on a Sunday morning and going for that hike and morning coffee not alone…
 So, I am thinking
- I’m ready to travel and meet people there (pay for apps and date and travel)
- Meet people online and see if I can visit them
- No church or grocery stores for me, nobody at the gym or work either, friends are same as me, single sad girls or older couples from same country

Is this salvageable? ,"It sounds terrible when I read that in isolation but let me explain. I (29M) had been with someone (28F) who lived a distance away for several years then Covid (2020-2021) happened and we grew apart. I saw them once when Covid restrictions lifted somewhat at the end of 2021–we met and had a coffee and caught up. I don’t know why, but I just couldn’t find the courage to formally break up. We just wasn’t a thing, we hardly spoke and didn’t see each other again in person and eventually stopped talking altogether. Enter my partner (29F) who has been in my life for years as a friend, but wanted to be friends with benefits. She knew I was with someone, but I was frank and said things weren’t going to last between us. We then slowly started to see one another casually, nothing with labels, it was largely friends with benefits. This would have been around November 2021. My partner began to feel bad about the blurred lines between the relationships, and would ask if it was over and I would say yes, because it felt like it was. 

Fast forward to 2023, me and my partner have had a lot of ups and downs. Shes ended our informal relationship several times. At one point openly said that she met someone at work she wanted to try things with and dropped me to pursue that. It fizzled out and she decided to travel instead, returning because she’d run out of cash in late 2023. We caught up and we slowly resumed where had been. Throughout this she’s always been clear that we are faithful to one another, if we want to pursue other people fine, but be open about it—I never did want to. Now it’s 2024, we were meant to meet to have a conversation about us and the future—it felt like things might actually become serious. But 30 minutes before the meeting she messaged to say she’d contacted my ex and couldn’t believe I’d lied (presumably about not formally ending things). I’m a bit puzzled how an ex relationship that ended in what felt like 2019 has somehow ended something that has been so informal since 2021. Am I being an idiot? Is this salvageable?

1gkqhiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1gkqhiv/the_perfect_college_application_confirmed_working/,"The Perfect College Application (Confirmed Working, Previous Experience)","Hi all, wanted to share my 100% acceptance rate college essay... lmk if you have any questions!

I was accepted into HYPSM + 6 T20s with full rides

Dear Admissions Officers,

Look.

Let's skip the fake humility and cookie-cutter essays about ""finding myself"" during a summer internship. We both know this isn't going to be like the other 50,000 applications sitting in your inbox. Those applicants can't make your building float with a thought. I can. They can't read your mind while you're reading this essay. I am. (Yes, that sandwich in your fridge is expired. No, you shouldn't eat it.)

Here's the thing: I'm the first human with superpowers. Not the ""I'm really good at Excel"" kind of powers. I'm talking about the ""I could turn your desk into a dragon while simultaneously solving world hunger and acing the LSAT"" kind of powers. And yes, before you ask - I did write this essay while hovering upside down in the stratosphere. Reception is surprisingly good up here.

Want proof? Check your coffee mug. Yeah, it's levitating. Don't worry, I won't spill it... probably. Consider that a small demonstration of what I'm capable of. Trust me, making office supplies dance is like kindergarten stuff compared to my full repertoire. I could tell you about the time I accidentally created a pocket dimension while trying to find my missing sock, but that's a story for after you admit me.

You might be wondering why someone who can bend reality like a twisty straw would even want to go to college. Well, that's the fun part- I don't need to. But you? You need me. Because right now, some other admissions officer at \[RIVAL SCHOOL\] is reading their copy of this essay, and they're thinking real hard about how nice it would be to have a student who can guarantee sunny weather during campus tours and materialize parking spaces out of thin air.

Consider this: you're not just admitting a student; you're securing your institution's place in history. Imagine your admissions statistics:

* Average SAT Score: 1520
* Average GPA: 3.9
* Number of Students Who Can Reverse Time: 1
* Percentage of Student Body Who Can Turn Water Into Mountain Dew: 0.001%

Think about your marketing materials: ""Choose between Harvard's centuries of academic excellence or our university's literal superhero who can make it rain pizza in the dining hall."" Your choice.

Your physics department won't just study how I violate the laws of thermodynamics - they'll get to rewrite them. The bio department won't just analyze how I regenerate limbs- they'll watch me regrow dinosaurs. Just small ones, I promise. Usually. Your business school could examine how my ability to materialize gold affects global markets (I promise to crash the economy responsibly).

Regarding my sudden acquisition of these powers - yes, it's convenient timing for college applications. No, I won't elaborate until after you admit me. The story will be exclusive to whatever institution is wise enough to offer me admission.

I should note that traditional merit scholarships are irrelevant to someone who can conjure precious metals and cryptocurrency with a thought. Instead, I'm interested in more creative forms of compensation:

1. Naming rights to all future discovered dimensions I create
2. A guaranteed parking spot (I can't solve that problem without help)
3. Access to whatever school resources I need... like alumnis, meetings with world leaders, etc.
4. An exemption from the required freshman dining and housing plan (I can literally make better food appear)
5. A written agreement that all females will be under my protection

In the ""additional information"" section, I've included several links to YouTube videos proving my abilities.

Consider your options very carefully. In a few years, some college is going to be known as ""the one with the superhero,"" and their endowment will be measured in infinity plus one. The only question is: will it be yours?

Sure, you could reject this application as the most audacious piece of creative writing to ever grace your admissions portal. You could dismiss my claims as statistically improbable, scientifically impossible, and grammatically questionable. But can you afford to take that risk? In the immortal words of your institution's founder \[INSERT NAME AFTER QUICK WIKIPEDIA SEARCH\], ""Nothing ventured, nothing gained.""

And I mean, the floating cup should have said it all. But if not, remember: I've watched a timeline where you said yes and your university became the most powerful institution in the multiverse. No pressure though.

The choice is yours. But remember: with great power comes great university rankings.

Sincerely, \[Name Redacted for Security Reasons\]

P.S. - This essay was written while simultaneously preventing three alien invasions and teaching English to dolphins. Please excuse any typos.

P.P.S. - The dolphins say ""hi.""",10,1730868382.0,ApplyingToCollege,2,0.92,False

- We are city people. Have lived in Dallas Uptown / downtown high-rises in the last few years.

So recently it's been more frequent that whenever I try to wake up in the morning I just have this weird and like, like a sort of headache that it makes me unable to wake up. Like my energy is depleted. The headache is too severe and weird that it makes  me wanna poke a hole in my head and checkout for myself... 

2. The headache's I have sometimes is so severe that sometimes it feels like something is bursting inside my head or like something is eating my brain from inside or like my hesd from inside is being pricked by needles and sometimes the pressure in my head is just too much that I wanna crack my skull open... 

3. The headaches have come to point where I'm not even able to indulge in activities properly. I've lost my comprehension skills, everything seems confusing, I'm unable to talk properly, and everything just feels so dull. That sometimes I feel like why am I even alive. 

4. Since I'm unable to indulge in regular activities even my body feels exhausted and for some frigging reason my body is just hot all time ( like sometimes in summers my rest of the body goes out cold while my head is just hot and in winters my body is just hot that I can't even enjoy the cold and I feel a lot of strain due to it) even my vision has worsened and its so irritating to not be able to see without specs.. 

5. I've went for check ups like 5 times for this in almost 2 years but they all say the same thing like nothing is wrong amd just prescribe me with meds, and meds just make me feel dizzy sometimes making me feel like acid inside my stomach... One of them even asked me to stop caffeine and I did for like more than a year but then the headaches didn't got effected with my sudden stop for caffeine instead it just increased and since I stopped caffeine my energy levels dropped drastically and now I'm just unable to drink coffee the same way I used to ( it makes me wanna just vomit it out after I drink) before when I used to go out to play I'd make sure to drink a cup of coffee... But now I can't even drink it and its just so frustrating.... 
 
*my friends and family ask why I don't indulge in any activities or why I am being so weird and all or what's wrong etc... But when I explain what's actually happening they just blame me that I don't eat well, and I'm just too much on screen, etc, etc other excuses... I'm just so tired and frustrated for them asking me or pointing out to me the same thing and me having to explain this.... It's just too much to me that I even cut off most of friends off my life and now I only maintain connection's with few... My body just feels like its dying and giving out with each day passing. Due to isolation because of these my senses are like hightened and any sudden loud noise can scare me even if I know there's gonna be a loud noise banging... Also the reason why I don't attend school much, so in school my classmates tease me for being absent almost the whole session and still passing with good enough grades... But I'm just too full with myself to even explain anything to them or be bothered by them

I'm almost 19 and I don't even have any idea what on earth is going on in my life.. Except for headaches, exhaustion becoming more severe... And me somehow trying to cope with it searching for a balance. Yet to no avail.. ",0,1730868251.0,self,4,0.5,False

And it wasn't the usual matcha + shot of espresso + milk combination that I know, I suspect it was a full on coffee drink + matcha. It felt really intense after I had it, at first I just wanted to stay awake but by at night, I felt a very strong sense of anxiety come on. This was a day ago. Yesterday night my anxiety got triggered again. This morning I still feel the anxiety. I have no idea what's happening. I'm drinking a lot of water and I had a presentation yesterday that I felt nervous for so the effects should have gone off...

Is there anything I can do about it? Walk a lot? Climb some stairs? Can't really exercise because I have class today",1,1730868175.0,Anxiety,3,1.0,False

1gkqbh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1gkqbh8/first_faint_after_4_years/,First faint after 4 years,"I was diagnosed by my PCP w/ POTs soon after being hospitalized with viral meningitis in 2020. I recently had a TTT to be sure once I could afford it and my cardiologist was able to confirm it. Luckily it appears that I have a fairly mild form of it and symptoms seem to be mostly controlled with metoprolol and salt/water intake. I notice more symptoms in the heat and of course from a sitting/kneeling position to standing upright. Usually my vision will go black or get very “fuzzy” for 10 secs or so and then recover just as fast as it goes and that’s the extent. I’ve never lost consciousness - until the other day. Hindsight I can pinpoint the places I went wrong but I guess I never thought I would have a complete fainting episode since it hadn’t happened in the last several years and even after a TTT. 
Problem #1 I had too much coffee and not enough water earlier in the day that this occurred. Problem #2 & #3 (the more obvious ones) I “gardened” and within 10 mins of doing that I was fairly physically active. Shortly after this I become very lightheaded and my vision started to go, but much slower this time. I sat down immediately, not being new to this, and told my husband I didn’t feel well. Within seconds my hearing went and it sounded like I was under water. Almost an out of body experience. Soon after that I fainted and lost consciousness. Just as I was fainting my husband said my lips turned blue and under my eyes got dark and then I started dry heaving. At this time my husband was getting me down on the floor in case I aspirated or seized as the poor guy didn’t know exactly what was happening. I don’t remember any of that but next thing I knew I laying on the floor and coming to. I’ve never fainted before so this was obviously very traumatic. I was very nauseous for about 2 hrs after and my chest felt very heavy. My Apple Watch registered a HR of 152 bpm (unsure if that was peak or not). Unfortunately wasn’t able to capture BP. 
I have done all of these activities before, but not all together as described above and I think that’s what set it off. I’ll be following up with cardiologist to discuss further. Just sharing details/data in case it helps anyone else. ",2,1730867744.0,POTS,2,1.0,False
1gkq8y1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gkq8y1/cmv_i_strongly_dislike_my_dark_brown_eyes/,CMV: I strongly dislike my dark brown eyes ,"I hate the dark brown eyes color on me. I think it makes me look bored, uninteresting, plain, common and flat 100%. I don't deny the fact that some people might look average and good suitable with brown eyes but when it comes to myself I just feel so inadequate and dead staring with such undesirable darkness. I guess I inherited the trait from my family (we are all Latin) and I'm still thinking it's dull and boring. Perhaps it's just internalized colorism or hidden racism (not intentionally) I have seen media portraying lighter eyes as the standard beauty and I feel they are right about it. From Light brown, Caramel, Amber, Hazel, Green, Blue, Gray and shades between these colors and mixed are richer and creatives unlike dark brown/black. I know eyes also works for the gift of sight which I am grateful for (I suffer from sensitive dry eyes 👀 which avoid me to carry colored contacts unfortunately and if I do, I would feel fake after all) But the rest of it, I think I just feel hatred, discomfort and other emotions that only makes me feel sorry myself and entirely plain. I wish a lighter brown will do the right thing for me, Amber or green etc except the ugly brown-black. I have never had any compliments in person about my eyes color 👁️ since they lack of life and don't even slightly change against the sunlight at ALL. I feel it but I understand honestly. Having Dark Brown hair doesn't help either. My pale skin which at don't complain at least, would do better and hide my eye bags if it wasn't for the extreme darkness of the iris that makes me think enhance my dark circles around my eye area like a zombie. I really wish a lighter shade will harmonize my sight zone bringing down my unpleasant looking sleepy stare when I just focus my dark eyes into something or someone, this honestly makes me extremely unsatisfied, and the fact I have read people start calling them (about the color in general) ""Mocha Dark"" ""Black Coffee"" ""Root Beer"" ""Black Pools"" etc as a way to romantize them makes the whole situation even more inconvenient since it seems like that's just a failed attempt to make somebody feels good while feeling sorry for them about the trait they have, in this case (dark brown eyes) which has nothing especial about at least in my persona (I would trade them any day of the week) unlike warming light brown, bright gold, sweet caramel, candid honey, exotic amber or unique enigmatic green, or piercing striking blue or fascinating silver gray and other blends together that brings the richness that colored eyes are supposed to. I find my combo shade (dark hair and eyes) in many members of my family and that reminds me a part of myself that I deeply reject. 

NOTE: I used to have natural light hair until my early teens (Light Brown/Dark Blonde) and it was a consolating feeling in relation with the dark eyes (I was born with red hair before it didappeared which makes it even more fantastic) and it saddens me that I have lost forever such great shade. As insane as it sound, I have cried tears of sourness and bitterness when comparing myself with other lucky people owning such great light, vibrant, fantastic and globally exotic shades and can't help but feel envy towards them especially when they get the nice attention and I just become boring and nul. 

UPDATE: For any wonder, my ethnicity is Latino and my current state is natural (dark brown natural hair and eyes, not contact lenses neither colored treated hair and light natural skin without any sort of tanning) although I have dyed my hair several times before (from Light brown until Strawberry Blonde) which were received with great compliments yet unnatural and exhausting maintenance (It was the color that got attention, not myself and afraid that would happen also if apply the same statement with colorful lenses to my eyes) and before I might receive harsh reactions, I decided to continue (or extend) my issue explaining deeper my personal situation but I'm not close minded and recognize those points of view that seems useful and open about changes of mind and overthinking if that makes any sense. I'm still very much unsatisfied.",0,1730867475.0,changemyview,29,0.24,False

I have tasted black coffee may 1-2 times in the past .

Today I saw on the BigBasket app ""Continental Extra South Blend "" for Rs 79 (MRP 170) for 50 gm. 

Should I buy this to reap the health benefits of black coffee? I have no idea if this brand is okay for black coffee.

My priority is low price and health benefits. Other nuances are currently not my priority
