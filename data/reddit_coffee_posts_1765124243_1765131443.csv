The rules are very simple:
- No two days can be named exactly the same.
- Do not make the name too long (it must fit in the box in the image)
- It must end with 'Day' (if your comment doesn't include it, I will add it).

1pgp3s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/gurgaon/comments/1pgp3s3/thats_it_i_am_done_with_this_bs/,Thats it! I am done with this BS!,"For the past 2 years, I’ve genuinely tried to find someone real. I’ve talked to around 6–7 girls during this time, gave conversations a chance, invested time, stayed hopeful every single time. And since people usually ask — yes, I’m a bald guy with a decent physique and a stable job. I’m not extraordinary, but I take care of myself, stay respectful, and carry myself with sincerity.

I don’t usually post things like this, but I guess I need to let it out somewhere. I’ve always been the kind of person who sees the good in others, the guy who encourages, compliments, helps whenever possible. For so long I believed kindness still mattered. But lately, it feels like the world has changed, and genuineness is almost treated like a weakness.

Over and over again, I’ve seen the same pattern. At first, these girls want a “green flag,” a nice guy, someone stable and caring. And I believed them every time. But eventually, after months of talking, it slips out, apparently green flags are “boring,” and what they actually want is a red flag or a person wealthy enough to cover all their expenses and shok. Emotional connection suddenly becomes irrelevant. (Not all but surely a majority of them)

Recently, I thought I finally found someone different. I’d been talking to this girl on Instagram for a few months. Our humor matched perfectly, our likes and dislikes synced, and conversations just flowed naturally. She knew I was bald, it’s clear in my photos, and I had told her openly at the beginning and she was okay with it.

We met today for coffee. The conversation was great… until the very end. Out of nowhere, she said she’s “not really into bald men.” And honestly, what hurt wasn’t the line itself, it was the fact that she already knew this about me for months. She could’ve told me earlier, but she didn’t. Instead, she enjoyed the attention, care, and validation from my end. She hid it because she liked the way I treated her.

When I asked her what exactly she *is* looking for, she openly said she wants someone extremely wealthy because that’s her only goal in life.

And in that moment, all I could think was: *Not again. Not this same cycle.* Imagine marrying someone with no emotional bond.

I genuinely don’t understand how people can be with someone they have no emotional bond with. How do you build a life around money alone? Where’s the connection, the care?

I’m not just disappointed anymore, I’m drained. Emotionally exhausted. And honestly scared that this is what dating has become. That people like me, who lead with heart, are slowly becoming invisible.

If you have a loving, emotionally present partner… man, you’re one lucky bastard. Don’t ever take that for granted.

I moved from Michigan with my partner and cat in 2022 to try out city life and for art/music opportunities. I'm trying to build a social life but haven't had much luck doing it in person at my regular local haunts. I prefer my friends are progressive with a moral compass (anti-capitalist, anti-war, anti-Zionist, and pro-healthcare, food, safe housing, and education for all people). I am neurodivergent and do better one on one or very small groups when getting to know someone. Some hobbies are making art and crafts, watching movies, working out (nature walks, pilates, barre, dance and yoga mainly), cultural activities (mine or learning about others), free events at the Newberry Library/Poetry Center, cooking and baking, playing games, reading and learning new things. I'm willing to give most things that aren't sports-related a try.

My heritage is Blackfeet, Irish, and Ashkenazi German Jewish and is important to me, but I rarely go to synagogue due to the local ones being Israel apologists. I'd really love to connect with other progressives who are affirming of neurodivergent people, who are queer friendly, don't have a problem with adults using cannabis, and don't judge people based on things they cannot control. My goal is to build a friend group of my own with people who are kind, weird, enjoy making or supporting the arts, and who have the time and capacity for active friendships, to have regular communication, emotionally support each other, and hang out together on a regular basis. I'm always looking for people to go on walks and get coffee with, see art shows whether they're mine or at other galleries, and go to metal/alt/emo/hardcore esque shows at local venues.

Does my gratefulness make me seem too easy?

Two days ago, I was already having a terrible day.
My dad is in the hospital, and I was on my way there stressed, worried, mentally all over the place.

And then life decided it wasn’t chaotic enough.

As I 22f was taking a turn, this teenage boy .. maybe 18 or 19 .. came flying out of nowhere at full speed and slammed straight into my scooter
My scooter got a huge dent, my body jolted, and before I could even process it, a crowd had already formed around us

As in India, you know what happens next people crowd, shout, try to “solve” it, make it worse, give 100s of opinions, and it becomes a circus!

While the boy who crashed into me (let’s call him S) was panicking, suddenly this guy stepped in.

Let’s call him A.

He was tall, around 6 ft, moderately built, confident posture : the kind of person who looks like he’s used to talking his way through situations. I later found out he works in sales, which honestly makes perfect sense~

He walked into the crowd like he was slicing through it. Low voice, telling people-

“Bas, bas, side ho jaayein”

“Isko thodi jagah do”

“Sun lo usko”

And to my surprise… people actually listened. Half of it don’t even remember 
He basically took control of the chaos and shielded me from the noise. He helped calm S down, helped me deal with my scooter, helped handle the conversation, and for a moment he felt like the only sane person there
At that point, I genuinely appreciated him.

Eventually, things got settled.
S went home.
I had to go for repairs before getting back to the hospital.

We exchanged numbers for updates, coordination, and because at that time he seemed like a stable, helpful stranger in a very unstable day

That’s where the story should have ended.

But it didn’t!!

For the past two days, A has been texting me…

Not about repairs.
Not about something urgent.
Just… emotionally invested texts like he’s already gotten attached.

Chats like:

“Did you eat?”
“Would you like to join me for coffee this weekend?”
“You didn’t look good when you cried that day… I’d like seeing you laugh.”

Meanwhile I keep replying politely but dry:

“I don’t know you yet.”
“I can’t.”
“That wasn’t funny.”

And he still continues.

And all of this… in 48 hours.

He’s not creepy exactly.
He hasn’t crossed a hard boundary.
But he’s too involved, too fast, and it’s making me uneasy
I don’t want to be rude because he genuinely helped me when I needed it.
But I also don’t want a stranger acting like he has some emotional claim over my life after 48 hours.

Do I seem easy ? How do I set boundaries without feeling guilty?
Am I overreacting, or is this situation actually strange? I’d really appreciate your thoughts.

1pgopom,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthecreep/comments/1pgopom/i_shouldnt_have_tricked_my_dad_into_shooting_the/,I Shouldn't Have Tricked My Dad into Shooting the Family Dog,"Two and half hours east of Banff National Park, and two and a half hours west of Alberta's dinosaur badlands, Red Deer’s location dead-center between Edmonton and Calgary quickly made it grow into the third largest city in Alberta, and it’s *still* growing. Because of its vast walking and biking trails, parks, and kayaking down the Red Deer River that cuts through it, Red Deer is the most ""active city"" in Canada. But its larger and more sensational title — ""Highest Crime Rate of Any City in Canada"" — would technically and probably make it the most anti-Canadian city in Canada, if that’s something possible. Mostly property crimes and auto theft, over proportionate to the stereotypical violent crime we also have, but my dad wanted out of there just the same.

I don't remember this happening, but my dad says someone stole his car while I was still strapped in my carseat. The guy drove at high speeds on the ice for five minutes before noticing me in the rearview mirror. To the guy's credit, he immediately pulled over, parked, cranked the heat (it was -40°), and ran. When the RCMP caught him eventually, he said stealing a kid wasn’t shit he signed up for. My dad always warned me that it could have been so much worse, that it could have been someone else not so nice. But that was his final straw.

My father was the first and only city-boy in his large and poor immigrant family to buy land, and on top of that, land in the remote peaceful countryside away from any chaos. The property was sold at a great discounted price, the only reason such a dream could be possible. The neighbor who sold it to us, Lucas Thompson, his mean father used to own our homestead. But after Mr. Thompson's father got drunk and attacked a coyote with his bare hands, it bit him and gave him something apparently similar to rabies, then he died. Mr. Thompson told us to never go near the coyotes or any of the animals within the property limits, but they're everywhere and it's never been an issue.

The homestead my dad bought and rebuilt — Coyote Ridge Ranch — was a 15 mile (or 24 kilometer) drive outside Red Deer. Alberta is miserable for most of the year, but driving home during the summertime is something I cherish. Once you escaped the confines of city limits, you soared past rolling hills of vibrantly yellow canola fields, broken up by spits of white quaking aspen and spruce forest (the trees too reedy for a proper tree-fort, unfortunately). At the end of your 15 mile cruise, you’d turn off Range Road 260 onto a single lane gravel road that stretched 3 miles. That was the place I was privileged to call home.

My earliest memory wasn't a car heist. My earliest memory was my father taking me into the woods one summer night as a four-year-old, gently shushing me, and pointing up. Above, clinging to a high tree limb, was a massive porcupine, the same one that we think later put a dozen quills into the muzzle of one of our dogs, Cocoa. That was just the beginning of my obsession with animals. Most of my memories formed in the summer. There was the tiny fawn I found in the tall grass, hiding with its head down and eyes closed until I passed. Or the foxes I would chase on my bike until I lost sight of them in the trees. Or the prairie dogs that always darted across the gravel as we drove up, and ducked down in the fields — though I haven’t seen one in almost fifteen years. My dad swore up and down he hadn’t drowned out a prairie dog from its tunnel since he was at least a teenager, when he used to trespass with his friends and pine over this area.

Dad never seemed protective of any wild animals, but his enthusiasm for birds was an exception. He was elated when I woke him up to tell him there was a nest of barn swallows outside my window. He was even more excited when a **ruby-throated hummingbird** hit our large living room window — he gently put the hummingbird in my hand while we waited for it to fly away again. My dad constantly pointed out yellow-warblers and Bohemian-wax-wings to me from the front porch, his binoculars and thumbed-through bird books always on the coffee table. Even when bird shit started to cake the porch because of the barn swallow’s nest, he wouldn’t let anyone touch them or move it. *“Took a lot of work for them to build, kid. They’re so cheerful with their chirps every morning, can't lose 'em.”* As much as my dad liked birds, I never liked our chickens. There were too many thoughts behind their eyes.

I had very few friends, only the animals. I chased away my older male cousins by becoming hysterical every time they shot a frog or bird with their pellet guns. The few friends I did have as a child, a couple sons of a few neighbors, stopped coming over once my father had his big falling-out with their parents. I hear one friend moved to big city Calgary and one moved to big city Edmonton when they grew up. It seems no one thought to stay here in Red Deer.

Despite the crime of the city we’d moved away from, my father never locked our doors. He always said *“If anyone’s ever gone so far out of their way to break into our house in the middle of the country, glass doors won’t stop them. Might as well let them take what they want, then have broken windows and doors and still lose our stuff anyway.”* When I asked him what would happen if we were home when someone broke in, he said *“That’s what dads and baseball bats under the bed are for.”* When I asked what would happen if it were ever just *me* home alone and someone tried to break in, he said *“Superman will always be here to protect you.”*

Ultimately, my childhood is what inspired me to also move away like my lost friends, to chase a doctorate in Zoology from the University of Florida. Before I moved, in my home-schooled isolation from any peers my age, I struggled to feel like a real Canadian; an identity crisis that increased as I became comfortable and acclimated to living in the United States. But I still told myself I felt like a proud Albertan, because the land itself was and would always be my home. The dirt just somehow smelled different. The sage and wildflowers were different. How the trees and grass and bugs rustled every night as the sun set was somehow different. I could tell it was, I listened. I didn’t know much about Canadian politics or music or history, or even much of the Metric system anymore. But I could tell you everything about how Alberta’s geology and paleontology was unique. Maybe I’d even lost the accent, but no one could take from me what was inside me. Maybe my dad didn’t always feel like he’d earned his spot as a real Canadian, but I would’t be him.

Every year that I come home to visit, I see the city expand more and more. The drive into town changed from a thirty minute drive to twenty-five. I feel a deep anxiety that someday the concrete expanse of Red Deer will overtake my peaceful shelter, which wasn’t helped by my own father’s push when I was a child to subdivide his own acreage. The neighbors, who shared a similar sentiment to mine, fought my father tooth and nail to preserve the sanctity of this cut of countryside and never bring in more strangers. They were real ranchers. My father was an outsider who tried to sneak in. Even with our neighbors a minimum of kilometers away, it was still somehow possible to feel even more alone.

There is some fraud to the picture I’m painting. Yes, we lived on an isolated homestead, but my father wasn’t running other men’s horses or ‘Berta beef cattle on our property for the sake of his livelihood like traditional Albertan ranchers, the yearly payment per head was menial. This lifestyle was a hobby to him, an appearance he enjoyed finally proving to his family he’d earned. But he’d drive into the city everyday and work like everyone else there. Maybe I’m a fraud too. Maybe I’m not really a rugged Canadian, maybe I’m really no one. Maybe I went to Florida to prove I’m an animal person, maybe I moved to the states to be the only Canadian in the room. Because when a second one shows up, suddenly the cracks in my story show.

Sometimes life out here with animals could be unsettling to a young child, though. Like the time I found deep footprints beside our stock pond, moose prints so large in the mud I thought at first glance they were made by grizzly paws. Nothing to a frost-bitten Canadian beats a grizzly bear in fear factor like an angry, horny bull moose.

Or, the time our barn cat, Herbie, her litter of newborn kittens suddenly completely vanished.

Or, the time I woke up in the middle of the night, startled, from the sudden ear piercing shriek of a dozen coyotes all at once right outside my window. The medley of howling was so close and so intense, it sounded like they were only on the other side of the glass. And as soon as the howling abruptly started — once I sat upright — it immediately and unnaturally stopped. As if it had never been there at all, as if I had only dreamt it in the last few seconds of sleep. I stayed awake and frozen, listening, panting in the stuffiness of my room. Then — now focused on the eerie silence, on the uncanny absence of yipping — a new noise came. It was faint, a faint crunch of gravel down the slope of our driveway. Something was walking up the drive, slowly and methodically. But it wasn’t a pack of scurrying animals. It was only one set of footsteps, staggering each lurch with a heavy pause. *Crunch.* Silence. *Crunch.* Silence. *Crunch.* Up the gravel towards the house, towards my window.

There was only once in my life I ever intentionally hurt an animal.

But I always thought, no matter the risks of rugged life out here (like the mother moose I surprised while picking wild raspberries and saskatoons in the deep brush, or the young bull that escaped from its pen and charged at me), any of it was safer than life in the city. As much danger large animals can be to people, *people would always be more dangerous than animals.*

I had taken a few weeks off this summer from my masters thesis research — studying the egg-laying habits of strawberry poison dart frogs — to see my dad. He waited until I was in the Jeep with him at arrivals to tell me that we wouldn’t really be camping again in a remote corner of the Yukon Territories after all. Dad was ill, very ill. It was an odd form of cancer that had rapidly developed in his throat and tonsils. But thankfully, despite the normal snail-pace of Canadian healthcare, he was being put through surgery extremely quickly. He'd already had so many appointments before I came that the preliminary work was over. Dad wouldn’t let me tell anyone in the family that he was sick, it just wasn’t the family’s culture. Out of embarrassment, Grandpa stopped going to church when he found out the congregation was praying for his colon cancer, and my dad wasn’t much better. Dad was determined to always be my invincible superman.

I asked him if I could come to the hospital with him in Calgary, to support him. But Dad each time said *“No thank you, Pearl.”* My dad didn’t want me to see him in pain, or struggling, or unable to talk or use his tongue in the immediate aftermath of the surgery. He said all he wanted was to be able to come home to me when he’d regained himself. All he needed to recover was the rare treat of being in my company, to sit on the couch with me, drink Prosecco, and watch our old shows together like *F Troop* and *Hogan’s Heroes*.

Once we parked in front of the house and I got out, I noticed a sizable dent in the front of his Jeep. But when I inquired about it, he acted like I hadn't asked.

Surgery on his throat was early the next morning, an hour and a half drive. That evening, I watched as he drove away in his old Wrangler Jeep, gravel kicking up behind him in a cloud of dust. I tried not to cry while still in his view, but at least he could see how much I cared. Before my dad got in his Jeep, he put a tender hand on my shoulder and looked deep in my eyes. A soulful, whispy quality in him I hadn't seen in a long time. *""Pearl, you have no idea what it means that you're here again. I can overcome anything I'm hit with, knowing I have you to come home to. You can 'mind over matter' anything.""*

Coming back to Alberta always felt like some sort of arrested development. I am a woman, but all the same, why was the idea of being home alone overnight here so hard? In Florida, I was an accomplished and independent student living in my own dorm. Hell, I’d already done an internship in Costa Rica, and I’d be doing a field research trip in Kenya in a few years to study strange African amphibians like caecilians for my doctorate thesis (I’d almost studied **Albertan tiger salamanders** for my masters thesis, but chose something more exotic and exciting). But coming home, I struggle to even pick out my own food at the grocery store. *What’s wrong with me?* But maybe that revert to childlikeness was a good thing, like a constant source of comfort I was still tapping into. The day I don’t turn up that long 3 mile drive off Range Road 260 to get home is the day something deep inside me will die. *But all those strange noises at night by myself, in the middle of nowhere…*

Once Dad was gone, I sat on the porch watching where he'd disappeared to, and drank more than half a bottle of flavored rum, like the white-trash Florida woman I’d become. Immediately, I realized it was a mistake. Normally, getting a little blitzed loosened me up, made me soft and giggly, and put me to bed. But instead, I was abnormally paranoid. Every creak and rustle around me on the porch felt like a hidden peril. Maybe I should have drank the Prosecco instead.

Like it bothered me how the cows were acting. Their grazing pasture encircled half the property, only 20 feet from the house. In the morning, they’d walk together in a single file line, all at their own individual pace with their own gestures. In my opinion, watching them was the best way to start the day with a cup of tea. But once my dad drove off, now all the beef cows gathered along the fence, standing side by side and staring at me, silent. No moos. No flicking of their ears, no swatting their heads and necks at bugs. After a few minutes of all watching me, all at once, they turned and walked off, dispersing into the hills of their field and disappearing from sight.

It also bothered me that the cat food bowl I’d filled earlier was still full. Herbie had long since disappeared, but one of her surviving kittens, Fluffy, had somehow managed to stick around. Dad hadn’t seen her in days, but he said her food bowl at least was always partially eaten or empty by sundown. I knew death was always a possibility for the cats, now down to only one. I hated that my dad wouldn’t get them fixed or keep them inside. Momma barn cats having inbred litters over and over again every summer was so hard on their little bodies, coyotes would always get them eventually, and outdoor cats kill billions of birds every year. But my dad cared about paying for people more than he cared about paying for animals, and didn’t see the need in interfering. *“Live and let live,”* he’d say. He never trained the dogs to do tricks, or put collars on them, he thought it was disrespectful. They stayed outside, he stayed inside. You know where I was.

I checked my phone, I was down to five percent. I got up, warm and wobbly from the rum, and wandered down the steps to Dad’s beat-up sedan. I’d taken my charger earlier when I ran to the grocery store before he left with his Jeep. I hadn’t bothered to put my shoes back on, and I was grateful my barefeet could still tolerate gravel. My entire childhood, I’d run up and down that steep drive with no shoes. The trick to remember is that pain from jagged gravel is dull and predicable, but the pain of surprise thistle in soft grass isn’t.

I pulled the heavy handle. *“Shit.”*

There were his keys on the dash. My dumbass forgot his car was old, annoyingly and defiantly old, and for some inexplicable reason, it locks automatically if you leave the fob inside. I could have sworn I had the fob securely in my pocket when I climbed out.

*“Fuck you, Pearl. Fuck my life.”*

I rubbed my eyes. Stupidly, my disappointment first and foremost was that I couldn’t listen to a podcast as I fell asleep that night (and anxiety from my dad’s grumpiness when he'd learned I’d locked us out of the car again). But then the greater importance of not having a cell phone in case of an emergency hit me. Now, not only was I alone, but I had no way to drive away or call for help if something happened. *Idiot.* I grabbed a wire hanger from inside and tried to fiddle with the door, but in my inebriated state it was no use. I went inside, searched my dad’s bedroom and office, none of his chargers fit my older phone model. While I was shuffling through his things, I found a contract my dad had signed to authorize oil drilling on the property again. He was going to make a lot of money if it went through. *Why hadn't he told me?*

I tried each car door one more time, no luck. I checked my phone, down to four percent. I fumbled with it and switched to airplane mode to preserve battery. I looked up around the property, feeling exposed to no longer be on the porch with the house to my back. *Damn, I miss having dogs.* Once Cocoa and Hershey died, my dad didn’t want new puppies. Maybe it was for the best, but I would have rather not felt so alone in that moment. Frustrated, I drank more, hoping this unease would dissipate. But the more I dulled my senses, the more I felt like I was in imminent danger.

I didn’t know how much longer I could stand being outside at all. There was an overwhelming odor of chicken manure. Chicken shit smells so different and so much worse than cow shit, I’d never managed to get used to that stench. But Dad hadn’t bought any new chickens in years, the coop was still falling apart. No matter where the wind blew from, or no wind at all, the smell was inescapable. I got up, antsy, and inside I microwaved up a bowl of instant pesto pasta. When I came back outside, thankfully the chicken manure smell was gone, and I could eat in some shamble of peace.

The sun was finally setting. Then, there was a strange buzzing outside, in the distance. It was a long unbroken note at first, then overtime it broke up, un-rhythmically, like someone or something *panting*. But the deep, droning, buzzing quality didn’t change. Then the panting in the distance turned into a yakking, past the hills, like something was violently throwing up.

I got up, my heart skidding. More than that, I was annoyed it was skidding. Why couldn’t I just enjoy this beautiful place? I went inside again and slammed the door, too stubborn to entertain this panic. I wanted to keep the house ventilated with the two screen doors, but the noise was so much, I closed all the doors and windows. I checked my phone, three percent. *Why would you think this is an emergency? Is it 911 in Canada too, or is it 999 like the British? Of course it's 911.* I couldn’t think straight at this point, the house was getting so warm. As it got darker outside, I couldn’t tell if what I was seeing were eyes outside, or lights from the house distorted in the glass reflections. I felt bloated, like I was being pumped with hot air. It was so sudden, it felt like I was becoming a sausage. *Why did I drink this much?*

I then felt a sudden unearthly tiredness that overcame me. I was too sleepy and stumbling to even make it to my old bedroom. I laid out on the couch and crashed, hard. I don't remember what I dreamt about, but it smelled of decay. And our two dogs were there, Cocoa and Hershey. They were black labs mixed with blue heeler, adopted the day we moved onto this property when I was a toddler. I’d known them my whole life until I was twelve. 

I miss those two dogs so damn much. I miss the sweet grey in their faces as they aged with me. I miss taking moonlit walks with them through the path in the trees. My dad never wanted me to go outside at night, he was afraid of the coyotes. He was afraid I’d be too small to take them on. But Cocoa and Hershey always walked side by side with me, and I was never afraid. Sometimes the cries of the coyotes would loom over us in the distance, but they did not fear the noise.

I dream of them often. But I never dream of Honey.

Honey was a cousin or something to Cocoa and Hershey, I don't know how, but she was bred by the same neighbor, Jake Duke on the north side of the property. A late addition to our little family. Honey was an inbred golden lab mix, her parents were siblings. Honey never acted quite right. Cocoa and Hershey, untrained but perfect as they were, always trailed behind us in a single-file line when we went on family walks, the cats and trusting chickens following close behind the two dogs in turn. But Honey would stop and squat to take a shit right in front of you on the path, oblivious you’d walk straight into it. 

Hershey once brought home a dying baby bunny in her mouth that she found, gentle and maternal, giving it to me to take care of (it died anyway). Sometimes Hershey would borrow a kitten from Herbie’s nursing litter so she could also be a mom for a little bit, grooming and cuddling the kitten in the warm grass. Hershey always brought the kitten back, and Herbie always trusted her. Cocoa once nearly gave his life protecting the free roaming chickens from a red fox. They truly were our family. But Honey wasn’t like that. Something wasn’t right with Honey.

Things came to a breaking point when Honey attacked one of the ducks in the pond. She shook it to pieces in her mouth, blood and organs and feathers everywhere. While Honey was mauling this duck, Cocoa and Hershey were rounding up the other ducks and ducklings like the precious discount sheepdogs they were. My dad wouldn’t tolerate this, he couldn’t trust Honey anymore, my protests didn't matter. *""What if Honey attacked you, too? Would your tiny hands and fingers be able to push her off?""*

And my dad wouldn’t give her up to the pound so another unsuspecting family would have to deal with her. So, my dad took her up the hill in the forest, shotgun in hand, and once out of sight, but not out of earshot from me, he put a bullet between her eyes. Dad said a dog knows when you’re going to shoot it. Apparently she fought the rope every step up the hill.

When I woke up on the couch, it was so hot, I brushed off my gut feeling that I'd been watched through the large living room windows while I slept. I panicked and thought the furnace had automatically kicked on or something, but it hadn't. I got up and looked for a box fan, I'd be pissed if my dad had thrown it out. I was shocked I was still as drunk as I was before. When I passed his computer again to go for his office closet, I realized I might still be able to reach people after all. I could text the neighbors from his desktop. His password was still my name.

When I logged into his computer, I was startled. Deeply startled. My dad had been on reddit (not the scary part). On a new account, he'd posted a gory photo of his Jeep's fender dent, covered in blood, with a decapitated coyote on the side of the road. He'd uploaded it *weeks* ago, but he still had it open, as if he'd just posted it. There were a lot of comments. None answering his question. Maybe he was still checking for an answer.

*""I was angry something fell through last night. I had a few, saw this on the road, and swerved to hit it. Yeah, I'm an asshole. Not my finest moment. Any advice how I can get this dent out? It's not coming out no matter what I do.""*

The coyote had been hit in the throat, its neck torn open, head hanging back limply.

*Why would he post this? This is unspeakable.* *He could have driven away and washed the blood off first. Why show the coyote? Why did he have to take a picture in that moment? Has my dad lost his mind?*

I closed the internet browser and went to his messages. The most recent text was a reminder from my dad's doctor for his scheduled appointment tomorrow morning, he'd replied ""CONFIRM,"" as he had to every other appointment reminder before. I typed the name of our closest neighbor, Lucas Thompson, in the text search bar. Then I paused again.

My dad's last message to Lucas Thompson: *""Please buy it back. I'll take anything. I need to get off this property. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. Tell me more about what happened to your dad.""*

Lucas Thompson: *""It’s too late. We all tried to warn you.""*

My dad: *""I'm not doing the oil drilling anymore. It wouldn't let us. Please call me.""*

I checked the paperwork on my dad's desk again. I hadn't read the contract properly the first time, I was too distracted. The contract authorizing oil drilling had actually been *canceled*. I thumbed through the contract, constantly losing my place from how my fingers shook. The ""Act of God"" clause of the contract was circled in yellow highlighter. Handwriting (that wasn't my father's) scribbled ""Reference incident report and 'Act of God' contractual reason for cancellation."" *What incident?* I couldn't find the incident report for the longest time. *Something about great bodily harm to the surveyor, but all these words are blurring together.*

I started to drunkenly text Lucas Thompson through the computer. It was as slurred as I was, full of typos. I had to start over a few times.

*""Lukas, this is earl. Perl. im here al one. can u chack onme""*

I hit send, then got up. At this point, I was too warm to function or process this more. A thick mucusy sweat was dripping down and rubbing between my fingers.

I was too hazy to notice that Mr. Lucas immediately texted back: *""You didn't deserve this.""*

I got up and searched through my dad's closet top and bottom, sloppily knocking everything over onto myself. Nothing. No fan. I was so hot I thought I'd die. But something told me to not open any windows. The humming and yakking outside wasn’t going away. It's not just that, I noticed something else — the chirp of the insects and symphony of frogs outside, muted through the walls, would stop and start again. Start and stop. Start and stop. As if I was plugging my ears and taking my fingers out over and over. It was everywhere. And it was just getting *louder*.

I went to the bathroom and flushed my face with cold tap water. It smelled foul, the well water always smells foul. Something to root me to reality. I gripped the sides of the sink. Outside, in the forest, the rumble and crack of a tree falling befuddled me, like a factory reset to my mind. In my entire life on Coyote Ridge Ranch, I had never heard a tree fall.

Then a second tree fell.

*“What’s coming?”*

I checked my phone. Two percent. *What would I even tell the cops?* Then I looked up from the sink to the dirty smudged mirror. I dropped my phone, and it cracked on the tile floor. I rubbed my eyes. My mouth had grown wider, impossibly so, my lips thinning and stretched. My eyes much smaller, and drifting apart like continents. I wiped the mirror clean, but the reality was only worse. When I’d look at my eyes, it looked like my mouth was growing. When I stared at my mouth, it was my eyes that were still changing. Like trying to track a floater in the corner of your vision, you swear you’re noticing something, but as soon as you focus on it, it darts away. My nose was sinking into my skin. I swear I wouldn’t miss that.

I left the bathroom, stumbling as I scooped my phone back up. Still two percent. The house was impossibly stuffy, like the air was encasing me in a dry pressurized tomb. I desperately just wanted to open a screened door, I just wanted a breath of fresh air to think clearly. But my hearing was still overwhelmed. The unrhythmic droning (and coughing) was so loud, the staggered insects and frogs were so enveloping, my senses were entirely overstimulated. I went upstairs to the bonus room, sloppily, falling on my face a few times as I climbed. I ran to the back of the room, moonlight streaming through the small single window, and I propped it open with a book. As soon as the window slid up and hit the top, the barrage of noises outside stopped.

I didn't care. I breathed in the fresh air with my wide open mouth against the window screen, grateful to feel the wind on my tongue. I paused, and held my breath. Outside below me was the whining of a frail newborn kitten. A single one. It was soft, hungry, barely a sigh.

Despite my heat exhaustion, I felt my sweat run cold.

*Don’t go outside.*

*It’s trying to make you go outside.*

My movements weren’t frantic and sporadic anymore. Calculated and cautioned, but still wobbly, I pulled a flashlight from a drawer, and slowly lifted it to the screen of the window. Nothing.

My chest hurt. Everything hurt. The acidic ballooning in my stomach and igneous constricting of my esophagus was only worse. This must have been the worst panic attack I’d ever experienced in my life because the physical toll was unbearable. Some how, impossibly, I wasn’t sobering up. I was getting drunker.

My fingers fumbling with the screen, I slide my phone off airplane mode, ready to finally call someone, anyone. I couldn't justify toughing through this anymore. I couldn't be stoic like my dad.

The phone died in my hands. I held down all the buttons to power it back on, hoping for any semblance of a second chance. Probably in vain, but maybe it had just crashed, it was an old model, it crashed all the time. It was still at two percent.

Overwhelmed, I gripped my knees, and started vomiting. My vision was blacking in and out, I couldn’t see where I’d blown chunks, but some of it hit my bare legs. As I stood back up, swaying, I was perplexed. I felt so hot and corrosive inside. But whatever was coating my legs was ice cold. My vision still spotting, I swiped my hand on my leg and smelled it. It didn’t smell like bile and stomach acid and pesto. It smelled like dead fish.

*“Alright, time to kill yourself Pearl.”*

I gripped the windowsill, trying to swallow a deep and helpless cry. Then paused. I was snapped out of my internal misery. My dad was outside, standing in the high grass of the open field, shrouded by the halo of moonlight at his back. I couldn't tell if he was staring straight ahead into the void or directly up at me.

I lifted the flashlight to the window screen a second time, then immediately dropped it, no, *threw* it away. The moment my flashlight crossed his body, that's when I chucked it. *That is my father outside. But something is very, very wrong.* His mouth wasn't open, but it came down to his stomach, I don't know how to describe it, I didn't look at it long enough, I *wouldn't* look at it long enough. Ruby red blood ran down from under his chin, soaking his entire neck, like any skin past his ears had been flayed.

His eyes.

Something was wrong with his eyes. They weren't bloodshot, but they were flat, bulbous, and orange.

That's all I saw before I slammed the window shut. I sank to the floor, my back to the wall. I had to stay quiet. My tongue felt so large in my mouth, I couldn't gasp even if I wanted to.

*DING!* I jumped out of my skin.

Miraculously, my phone turned back on. One percent. I had a new text from several hours ago, one of the neighbors who doesn't speak to us.

JAKE DUKE (NORTH SIDE): *""I saw your dad crashed his Jeep at the property line. I'm sorry.""*

I frantically typed: *""Hwat? hes hear! Helpm!""*

No response. I sent more.

*""Somethng,s happeggg! Whats happenigg? wh Y?”*

He texted back immediately.

JAKE DUKE (NORTH SIDE): *""It was probably Honey.""*

As I dialed “911,” it died. For good.

*I need water. I need water on my skin, or I’ll die.*

But when I ran back downstairs to the bathroom, the minerals in the well water burned my skin. I didn't care. I needed it so bad. Then, the water stopped running from the facet.

I had no choice.

I burst through the front door and ran into the night, toward the stock ponds. I tripped on the porch and fell on my face, it loosened my teeth but I didn't care, I kept going. I didn't care about the noises coming from behind me in the tall grass, or the yacking hum and drone that had come back, or the overwhelming stench of chicken shit; nothing mattered to me more than this thirst in my skin. But when the water came into view, I didn't take another step.

The large pond was still full of water, but the small stock pond had dried up. In the center of the empty pond, the normal corpses of my dad — and *me* — were lying, bloated, being consumed by hordes of red ants.

My throat felt so cold and dry, I could barely croak.

""That's not me, I'm still here.""

There was a third body sunk deeper in the fresh mud, much farther in decomposition than ours. Though, it looked barely human — at first, I thought I was looking at the corpse of a **maned wolf**. His arms and legs were char black, they'd been mutilated and extended. His bones jutted back and fanned from his spine, and orange fungus erupted from his skin. He had the same cleft palate that runs in Lucas Thompson's family.

I was slammed to my back, and dragged. The peaceful quilt of unpolluted stars passed above me in a blur. I screamed and twisted my body, frantic to break free from whatever had once been my dad. But the grip on my ankle and the swiftness I was dragged through the high grass was inescapable. I felt a fiery, chemical burning, like every plant irritant I touched absorbed into my skin and pumped through my system.

My shirt was catching on the thistles and brambles dragged under me, the naked skin of my back scraping like hell. I grabbed at the grass, desperate to stop wherever we were going, desperate to fight whatever was coming.

When I was forcefully pulled through a wild Alberta-rose bush, there was a new, horrific sensation. My arms and legs caught on the thorns, and I could feel large portions of my skin slopping off my body. I screamed even louder. The lower dermis on my arms and legs were exposed, like I was a peach being blanched. When that fell away, my muscles underneath were left open, dragging bare in the dust and rocks. The long, unbroken shriek that left my lungs felt inhuman — but still inaudible over the humming that might split my head open, coming from whatever became of my dad. But even in darkness under the moon, the color wasn’t right. My muscles weren't pulpy pink and red, my flesh under my skin was black and puss yellow. I involuntarily swallowed some of my teeth as they fell from my gums and rolled around my mouth like butterscotches. I vomited again as my head thrashed back and forth. I spewed mucusy wads of viscus leeches all over my chest. They attached themselves to my exposed flesh, and swiftly burrowed winding trenches through open muscle as they ate me alive.

*I said I've only ever hurt an animal, on purpose, one time...*

Once, I *did* push one of the cats off the roof. I heard they’d always land on their feet, so I wanted to see it. The cat was fine, as far as I know. I wasn't *trying* to hurt Herbie. Once, I did accidentally tear the wings off a dragonfly when I tried catching it in my hands — though it seems it got even, because an hour later I was attacked by a swarm of wasps and sent to the hospital in anaphylactic shock. Once, one of the baby birds outside my window stopped eating, so I took it from its nest and forced food into its mouth with a tube. But I fed it too much, its little lungs aspirated, it choked in my hands and died. The next day all the baby birds were gone. They weren’t old enough to fly away.

Once or twice, I did dissect a dead frog and a dead tiger salamander I found floating in the pond. I was so fascinated by their anatomy, I fell in love with amphibians.

*But once... Only one time... I can remember when I was eleven, I became fixated on how cool I thought ducks were* — *the webbing in their feet and the delicate feathers in their wings. I wanted so badly to dissect one* *and see the tendons in their wings. One of the ducklings was sick. I checked on it everyday, but it wouldn’t die fast enough…*

The rotting skin of my dad's arms and back were scabbing and crumbling into a flaky and vivid gangrene. My dad's long hanging mouth and open bleeding throat fused into a single fleshy and narrow mandible, his teeth detached and flowing down from his jaw and jutting out both sides like a serrated beak. His arms, they weren't just growing, both arms were *fraying* apart — like stick cheese being pulled five ways at the base and curled down. Each finger split apart from his hand, each peeling back individual tendons, separating muscle. It bisected and splintered his bones, he cried out as the sponge and viscera of his bone marrow leaked out in a pulpy grey and purple mass. What his arms were now fanned and folded, like wings.

*Well, I was so afraid to get in trouble with my dad, that once I was finished, I put the dissected duck in Honey’s mouth.*

*That night, the coyotes came and woke me, and the quiet footsteps approached.*

*The next year, Cocoa and Hershey were both hit by two different drunk drivers.*

I was dragged into the murky pond water. My dad seized me by my throat with what remained of his hands, and shook me up and down under the water, callously drowning me. Water and slimy algae flooded my throat and my lungs. I clawed at his face, unrecognizable from the man who I loved most, the man who always swore to protect me. Hornwort weed entangled around my wet slippery fingers as I tried to push him off. But my fingers weren’t mine anymore. None of this was mine.

While I thrashed and fought blindly and terrifyingly for my life, my mind began to slow down and disassociate. His humming drone was finally muted with my ears underwater. My internal voice felt cold and echoey — like thought was unnecessary to the outcome of my circumstance. Or maybe that thought wasn’t a part of me anymore.

*How do these perfectly working little ecosystems spring up?* I thought in academic detachment. *My dad filled these ponds himself with a pump and a hose, but they’ve got leeches, tiger salamanders, water bugs, and cat tails all on their own. As if they were always here.*

With his mouth, my father sliced my abdomen open. Where my ovaries should have been, fish eggs spilled out. But they weren’t fish eggs, there were tiny salamanders wriggling and squirming inside.

The voice in my mind went quieter and quieter, drifting far away from my reach. Until I could barely hear it at all:

1pgop6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCAExams/comments/1pgop6b/you_will_pass_the_nca_exams_here_is_my/,You Will Pass the NCA Exams ! Here is my non-nonsense guide on How to do this :),"Eight exams. Eight months. One extremely demanding full-time job. And a decade away from legal practice. I passed every single NCA exam on my first attempt. If you’re starting this process feeling overwhelmed, burnt out, or unsure where to even begin, this is exactly what helped me. And I truly believe it can help you too. Let's get into it:

*1. The NCA Syllabus is the Bible! --*  
Start your prep by spending a day (or 3!) just reading through the syllabus. Ideally, get a printout. Highlight everything you think the syllabus is really stressing upon. The NCA is actually very good at telling you exactly what they want you to know in a course/subject. Know this before buying or reading any notes, textbooks, or attending any paid lectures. There is a high chance that on your 2nd or 3rd reading of the syllabus, you’ll realise you can do this absolutely on your own without any paid help! And even if not, you’ll at least know what kind of materials are going to help you achieve the learning goals of the syllabus.

2. *Different Strategies for Different Courses* \--  
TLDR: Ascertain what you need to achieve by the week of the exam and gear your prep for the course toward that specific goal. No point pointlessly reading 100s of pages of content (notes or textbooks).

There is no one straight-jacket formula that is going to help with every course. You want to understand what they want you to know in a course and attempt to achieve that ASAP. Eventually, by the week of the exam, you should be in a position to handle any sample questions you have—and do them with a timer. For example, for Admin Law, your studies should be geared toward eventually putting you in a position where you can look at a long fact pattern and decipher what the procedural fairness (and/or substantive review) issues are, and how you will address them. For Constitutional Law, you want to be able to look at a question and quickly identify which part of the syllabus it is from and what the appropriate test is to address it. For PR, the goal is to know the Model Code inside out so that you are able to quickly jump to the exact section you need to answer a particular question. For Criminal Code, the aim is not to know the entire Code, but to extensively practise (using ChatGPT or other sources) deciphering the elements (AR & MR) of random offences from the Code.These are just a few examples. Of course, there is more to each of these courses and any other course you might do—but I am sure you get the idea.

*3. Time management is key--*

This applies in two contexts: managing time to study, and managing time during the exam.

*Managing Study Time*\-  if you are a working professional or have any serious life commitments, time is obviously scarce. Here is what helped:

* Having all my study resources printed out and going through only a few loose leafs each day. 
* I used every bit of “downtime” in life to read—my daily commute, reaching my office two hours early and using that time at my desk, using two hours soon after returning from work, lunch break at work, replaced my nightly Netflix binges, and  used all of my weekends (eight hours each day) 
* My partner was extremely supportive, and we had an understanding that she would do the heavy lifting of our chores until I finished my NCAs. That way, if we went grocery shopping, for example, I would sit in the car and study while she went in and shopped. Then I helped load and unload the car. If you have a similar situation, try talking to your partner (and other family members) about temporary arrangements where they take on more chores and you dedicate all your non-working time to study.
* Having weekly goals instead of daily ones was lie changing! Life happens, and commitments emerge out of nowhere. Often daily goals are not met, and that leaves you with a feeling that things are piling up. Weekly tasks give you an opportunity to catch up for the days you couldn’t achieve much. With weekly goals, you can do a check-in with yourself every Saturday morning with your coffee and plan how you want to study for the weekend (as those are usually the heavier study sessions). Get an accountability partner  for this if you need one!
* Set concept/s as your daily/weekly goal and not pages!!

*Time management during the exam-*  It helps to get into the habit of being conscious of time. Here is what helped:

* When you are doing a sample question, always do it with a timer—even if you haven’t prepared enough.
* Short 5-minute Exercise: look at a random topic from the syllabus, start a stopwatch, and see how long it takes for you to find the relevant information from your resources. This will help you rethink your annotations and tabs, in case they need any adjustments.
*  A writing speed of 65+ WPM (ideally 70WPM) is a MUST to not panic during the exam. It gives you enough time to think, formulate, and re-read your answers. On the same note, you also want to increase your reading and comprehension speed. Look at all the sample UBC question papers (available online) and just time yourself reading the questions and formulating Issues (forget the RAC for this exercise). How long does it take to just decipher what the question is asking you to do? Depending on how long that takes, you’ll know how much time you have left for actually writing the R, A, and C parts of the answer. For the R and A parts, you also want to time how fast you can locate information in your materials. Sounds obvious but I am still saying it, ""if you know the I, you'll know which R's to use. If you know the R, you can just slap on facts from the questions and make your A. If the A is done, the C is done!""
* You have 1.8 minutes to write 1 mark’s worth of an answer (180 minutes for 100 marks). Aim to write it in 1.5 minutes, and you’ll always have some time (about 30 mins) at the end to re-read and reassess your responses!!

*4. Resources---*

* *Notes:*

TLDR: Despite claims, you won't pass NCAs purely because of a particular style of notes by a particular vendor. Ultimately, it is all about what works for you! Purchase wisely, if you must at all.

There are plenty of note sellers on the market who eventually all say the same thing. I am going to try to be as neutral as possible here because this subreddit often gets too heated and polarized about different vendors. Here’s what I’ll say: use the notes that work for you. They do not have to be the best notes out there—they just have to be coherent and address the syllabus fully. If they are the most expensive product on the market, then you shouldn’t have to buy lectures as well. If they are the cheapest on the market, well, you should set your expectations accordingly.

For me, time  was very scarce, so I did not want notes that ran into hundreds of pages. I also could not monetarily afford purchasing notes on top of the already pricy exam fees! Unfortunately, the one vendor most NCA candidates swear by has notes that run into hundreds of pages (and $$). I have no doubts they are decent , but it just didn’t work for me as a working professional. On the other hand, there are vendors who have very brief pointer-style notes, but they often lack coherence, and the sellers are never available for follow-up questions. So do your research and ask questions before placing bulk orders.

These are my  takes about buying notes:  
i) You are going to use this product only once for your NCAs, and then it is going to sit in your trash. Invest accordingly.

ii) If you are going to buy notes, buy them from someone who will be available for follow-up doubts and questions (for no charge), and not someone who is only interested in making a sale. I bought 3 sets from NCA Mentor and more than the notes, I loved their whatsapp community and the seller's availability to answer any doubts on whatsapp. The owner seems like a genuinely nice and helpful person. However, IMPO, the pricing of their products still seems grossly unreasonable. I could not justify purchasing all 8 subjects from them. On another note, I Also bought some super cheap frameworks from one other seller but they are not even worth mentioning.

iii) I have had a chance to peruse different products on the market and NO vendor makes sample Q&A that are actual reflections of the NCA standard. All their sample Qs are super easy and candidates relying on that difficulty level get blindsided in the exam. Always attempt University level sample Qs (UBC's online library) even if you don’t have an answer key for them. 

iv) Some of you , after reading the syllabus thoroughly (my first tip above) may realize that you don’t HAVE to buy notes at all. You may be able to make your own notes that are similar—or even better. So please read the syllabus before joining any note vendor's 'cult!'

*My personal experience with notes:* From my purchases, and upon reading those note sets, I learnt how vendors are essentially making notes and used similar methods to make my own using the internet. Ultimately, every vendor is just writing a few paragraphs about each heading and sub heading on the syllabus along with a case brief on the related cases from the syllabus. If you can literally look at each subheading (and related case) in the syllabus and write a few lines about it, you essentially have your own notes!!  I kept my personal notes to a max of 15–20 pages because I did not want to flip through many pages during my exam.  
(My personal notes are not for sale as of now, so please don’t reach out for a free copy. But this is exactly how I made them and you can too :))

* *Textbooks:*

  You DO NOT need to buy any textbooks. Since the NCA only requires you to score 50% on the exam to pass, chances are that as soon as you score a 50, the examiner stops checking your answer paper any further. Besides, Textbooks will require a lot more of your time and money (if you have it, that’s awesome!).

* *Internet is your friend!*

  For all syllabus cases and research articles (if any), the internet is your friend. As long as you are decent with the English language and basic analysis, just go through case summaries and make ChatGPT summaries for research articles (if any). You don’t need to read entire case laws and articles as long as you get the overall idea of what they are saying. You only need to use those ideas when responding to a fact pattern (or essay-style) question. On this note, use ChatGPT extensively BUT cautiously (as it will give wrong advice often). The way I used it was to make quick summaries and tables. (I can make a separate post about that someday).

* *Help from friends in Canadian law schools:*

  Eventually, the content is the same. If you have friends in law schools who have the same courses and are willing to share their personal notes/slides, etc., there’s no harm in taking a look at those as well (check copyright conflicts before borrowing any materials).

5\*Bonus, General, but important tips-

* If you are not a native English speaker, it is important to demystify legal language so you don’t get overwhelmed. Read something, then say it out loud in your own (simpler) words. For example, Sec 1 of the Charter (Oakes test) says: “The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.” In my own words, I would say: “Charter rights are not 100% guaranteed. They can have reasonable limits.” Simple but unforgettable!
* If the passing mark for an exam is 50%, you only need to be 50–60% happy with each answer on the exam. There is no point needlessly spending time perfecting them all. Just make sure the analysis is done, the point is made, and the examiner can see that you have read and applied the concepts from the syllabus.
* If you have less material on your desk during the exam, you will spend less time flipping through pages and debating which source to use.
* I made a page/card of “general stuff” for each course and kept it right next to my screen while writing the exam. This was generally applicable material that I could use to begin writing almost any answer for the course. I would quickly punch that into the Rules section of my IRAC, knowing that a mark or two WILL be awarded for writing it.
* Do not give up on life during this process. I did not let the NCAs affect my parties, outings, or date nights, etc. During these 8 months, I even took two short vacations. I also did not max out my leaves at my current job. And I am not even the brightest star in the sky! Let life happen as it does, just squeeze NCA prep into all your 'downtime.' It’s important not to let these exams burn you out.
* Respect time. A lot can happen in a short time with a lot of focus. Don't cancel or reschedule your exam if you feel unprepared. Make a realistic plan and study smartly, who knows, you may still pass!
* While preparing for the NCAs, don’t think about licensing, articling, provinces getting rid of bar exams, etc. Simply concentrate on the exams and get them out of the way ASAP. Everything else will fall into place :)
* Lastly, we are all different. Everything discussed in this post may not apply to you exactly as it did to me. But some of it most definitely will!

Remember that you have already done the hard part; You made it through law school. You have studied and/or practiced in another jurisdiction. You have overcome major personal and professional battles in your life. The NCAs are just a small set of exams on your way to licensing. It mere procedure you need to get out of your way. You only need 50% to pass. Don’t let it overwhelm you. Demystify it and crack it.

You are awesome. And you’ve got this!

PS: My DM's are always open if you need to reach out with any specific  NCA related questions. I'll try my best to respond in time. Thus far, all my help is free of cost :)

I’ve been roasting for about 2 months, am deeply enjoying it to this day! I’m using a SR800 + extension tube, and I am about 16 roasts into my journey.

My wife has suggested me I offer my family home-made roaster coffee as a present for Christmas, and I found the idea great! My only issue is my Father-in-law only drinks decaf!

Now my wife and I barely drink any decaf, but keep some on hand when he comes visit us. He always boasts as to how good the coffee is, even though I feel bad I serve him americanos with beans that are sometimes weeks, or even months hold, even if kept in Stainless fellow canisters.

I’d very much like to offer him freshly ground (since he only has a basic drip coffee maker) decaf, but I really don’t know how to tackle roasting it, as I’ve never did Decaf, and we usually roast light-to-medium.

**Do you have any tips or origins I should look into, and how coarse should I pre-grind decaf, for decent cups?**

I live in Montreal, Quebec, my personal grinder is a DF64. I bought my last batch from Torque, which is Honduras natural Mini granja, if this can be of any help!

I moved from Michigan with my partner and cat in 2022 to try out city life and for art/music opportunities. I'm trying to build a social life but haven't had much luck doing it in person at my regular local haunts. I prefer my friends are progressive with a moral compass (anti-capitalist, anti-war, anti-Zionist, and pro-healthcare, food, safe housing, and education for all people). I am neurodivergent and do better one on one or very small groups when getting to know someone. Some hobbies are making art and crafts, watching movies, working out (nature walks, pilates, barre, dance and yoga mainly), cultural activities (mine or learning about others), free events at the Newberry Library/Poetry Center, cooking and baking, playing games, reading and learning new things. I'm willing to give most things that aren't sports-related a try.

My heritage is Blackfeet, Irish, and Ashkenazi German Jewish and is important to me, but I rarely go to synagogue due to the local ones being Israel apologists. I'd really love to connect with other progressives who are affirming of neurodivergent people, who are queer friendly, don't have a problem with adults using cannabis, and don't judge people based on things they cannot control. My goal is to build a friend group of my own with people who are kind, weird, enjoy making or supporting the arts, and who have the time and capacity for active friendships, to have regular communication, emotionally support each other, and hang out together on a regular basis. I'm always looking for people to go on walks and get coffee with, see art shows whether they're mine or at other galleries, and go to metal/alt/emo/hardcore esque shows at local venues. No shame to busy people, but I'm looking for close friends, not more acquaintances I see 2x a year. Thanks for reading and stay warm!",1,1765129552.0,chicagofriends,0,1.0,False

But the twist is that the café has a little farm or greenhouse area behind it, where coffee plants are grown. You take care of the plants, harvest the beans, roast them, and then use those beans to make drinks for customers.

There are no NPC workers and no instant deliveries. If you need supplies like sugar, milk, cups, or snacks, you actually get into a small truck, drive to the nearby town, and buy everything yourself from shops. The gameplay is built around a daily routine: checking on the plants in the morning, roasting beans, opening the café, serving customers, closing for the day, and making supply runs when needed.

The overall vibe is meant to be slow, cozy, and immersive — warm lighting, rainy evenings, simple conversations with regulars, and a quiet rural setting. It mixes a small farming loop with a hands-on café experience and slice‑of‑life atmosphere.",2,1765129547.0,SoloDevelopment,4,1.0,False

It got me thinking about “what if Upside Down Hawkins was rebranded as ‘UpDoHa’ and I just had to write this fun little news story.*

Hey Hawkins, breaking news! We’re thrilled to share that Stronger Things Coffee has set its grand opening in the up-and-coming UpDoHa neighborhood.

Stronger Things Coffee is one of the first businesses to open its doors as part of the rebranding strategy for Upside Down Hawkins--now called UpDoHa by the town council.

“Look, we know that residents may be a little nervous about coming into UpDoHa,” says one of the store owners, Jen Treefication. “But we’ve seen declining supernatural incident rates and we’re learning to embrace the constant lightning as a powerful source of green energy. We want you to see for yourself how great our little neighborhood is and dispel the hurtful myth that you need full PPE to cross over!”

Now that UpDoHa is reshaping its image from haunted nightmare forest with goo-filled trees and flesh-eating monsters, some are worried about preserving the neighborhood’s decades-long culture.

“We are committed to honoring this community’s roots,” says the director of coffee roasting, M.T. Mug. “That’s why we’ve commissioned a mural on the side of the building depicting demogorgons, demodogs, and demobats.”

Stronger Things Coffee is doing a soft opening tonight, with a full-menu rollout over the weekend.

I hope this is the right thread to drop this in.

Little background.  
I started a more carnivore diet about 10 weeks ago. The results have speak for themselves.  
\- Down almost 40 pounds  
\- I feel better overall. I used to have intestine problems. Gone.  
\- skin feels better (less dry skin)  
\- stomach fat noticeably gone. Clothes fit great.  
\- I feel like I am 15 years younger (48yo M).

I really try to keep things as simple as possible with my diet.  
I do the obvious with a low carb diet. No breads, rice, crackers, chips, junk, potatoes...the usual suspects.   
My diet has been primarily:  
\- beef, pork, eggs, some cheese, heavy cream with coffee, MCT, whole fat yogurt (home made) butter, sprinkle in some cauliflower, broccoli some leafy greens.

  
Probably more carnivore-ish right now, but I have been exploring moving to Keto for couple reasons.

That said, I am going in for my first blood work in January and I am a bit nervous.  
I have been trying to be a sponge to learn as much as I can about carnivore and keto.   
But the volume of resources and info is staggering and trying to put it all together is challenging. (I read/watch Dr. Ken Berry, Dr. Chaffe, Dr. Berg as my gotos....)

What confuses and confuses me is when I see folks post their lab results and their levels are ""bad"" or out of whack, which instantly makes me think ""what is going on and will that happen to me"". A bit of anxiety does start to creep in.  
I am looking for some suggestions from the community on where I can further learn to improve my diet and any caveats/concerns I should be looking out for (outside of the Dr. probably get upset when he sees my LDL up an wants to prescribe a statin.)

I consider myself a healthy, active individual. I do workout several times a week, mixing in variety including hiking/walking, kettlebell training and swimming when its warm enough.

Looking at my staples above, should I consider cutting things out? In my research and reading other folks post, I have seen folks recommend taking out things like dairy as it might contribute to some of the blood results with cholesterol/trigs etc.

I hope this makes sense. The diet so far has been great so now it is just me being diligent, finding what i need to tweak and tune to keep on the right track and do the right thing.

Always appreciate the feedback from the community. It has always been fantastic and helpful.

Much obliged!",2,1765128968.0,keto,4,1.0,False
1pgo7ye,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgo7ye,my take on adult Jeremie for my fic/AU,"**(Backstory)**

Jeremie still has trouble trusting the silence. On a surface level, even despite the trauma he and the group sustained, those years fighting on Lyoko were the best of his life - so when he started getting symptoms of post traumatic stress, he didn't understand why at first.

The paranoia hit him like a truck. Even if he took every precaution in the book, or prepared as much as he could, that feeling of wariness still persisted in the back of his mind. Something still could go wrong. XANA could still come back.

It reached a breaking point senior year of high school. One night in the winter he was rushed to the hospital, where he was formally diagnosed with PTSD and OCD and put on medication. When he went to an assigned therapist, Jeremie couldn't disclose *exactly* why he was feeling this way so he made it up partly, saying he and his friends went through a very traumatic experience with a stalker during their time at Kadic.



Despite it all, he went to live a relatively normal life afterwards. He still thinks those days with Lyoko were the best of his life… give or take a couple near death experiences.

He's at UC Berkeley as a comp sci and computer engineering professor.",11,1765128945.0,CodeLyoko,6,1.0,False
1pgo76j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1pgo76j/im_so_tired_of_living_this_shit/,I'm so tired of living this shit,"Long text but my loved ones have too much on their plate to eat some of mine, so you're free to read me or not.

My father's been in the hospital since the 10th of September due to a couple aneurisms and bacteria infecting the prosthesis. We were told he wouldn't survive the first one but he's alive and survived other 5 surgeries he's needed these months. I'm happy and grateful he's alive, of course, but I'm so fucking tired of acting like I have to be okay. I'm tired. I'm sick of this. Every time I'm walking in my neighborhood someone approaches me and asks me how he is. IN THE HOSPITAL. I know they're trying to be nice BUT DON'T ASK ME EVERY FUCKING DAY. There's a neighbor who's called him EVERY DAY since he got in and it doesn't fucking matter what we tell him, he calls at least 3 times a day and we never answer. 

My father is not taking it good at all since he's stubborn as fuck and thinks he can get up and walk after losing 20kg of muscle mass. His legs are fucking sticks, he can't. He's 63 and therefore young enough to do the rehab and walk again, which is great, but he's so fucking impatient it makes me want to leave him alone. I got fed up one day and gave him his cane, told him if he was so perfectly fine and they were exaggerating he could get up. He obviously couldn't even move his legs to the side of the bed. I thought maybe it could make him realize something but it's like talking to a fucking wall. He yells at me and my mum because we don't give him food. We don't because it's what the doctors have told us. He has the liquid thing with all the nutrients and calories he needs and it's what's keeping him alive. I understand he's tired, he's sick, he's the one stuck there, but he says every day that the doctors don't know anything and we're fucking stupid for listening to them and not give him food. THEY SAVED YOUR FUCKING LIFE SEVERAL TIMES. He does NOT have any studies or even interest in healthcare but he thinks he knows better.

On the other hand there's my grandma. She is a bitch and I fucking hate her because of disgusting things she did when I was a kid under her care. She's always been the most entitled person I've known, she's always acted like she's part of the fucking royalty when she was born among cows. Now it's worse because she's losing her mind completely and all these traits are getting worse. My mum, her daughter, called her 30 times today from 13 to 15 and she didn't pick up. My mum got nervous as fuck and as she was with my dad I went to see what was wrong with her. Nothing. She just didn't fucking want to pick up the phone because she was ""busy"". BUSY DOING WHAT?? we cook for her, clean for her, change her diapers, do her laundry. ANSWER THE DAMN PHONE. She was ""crocheting"" (she doesn't do any stitch right, she just makes knots in the wool). I've talked with my mum several times about getting her to a retirement place but she doesn't want to ""because she won't want it and is still too aware"". Okay. I guess it's better to wait until this happens again, I have to rush to her house and she wasn't ignoring the phone but fell, like it's happened before, and broke a bone or two so it's harder to take care of her. She lives in an apartment without an elevator and can barely walk already. That's another thing, she has cancer, so either my mum or I have to take her to the hospital several times a month and to a rehabilitation center every week. When we go to the hospital we take a taxi and it takes fucking ages but okay. When we go to the rehabilitation center I just can't stand it. We walk because it's too close to take a taxi and it wouldn't even arrive to the minimum (it's 5 minutes walking for me). She takes *40 minutes* to arrive, 30 doing the rehab, and another *50 minutes* to get back home because she's tired. Then I have to undress her and put her pijama, and she obviously always orders me to do something else before I leave, which I sometimes ignore.

I'm 23 and I feel like I've lost my life. I'm either at the hospital or with my grandma and I'm tired. They're NEVER grateful for anything we do for them, they treat me and my mum like we don't do anything right and we're useless. I met some friends for a coffee yesterday and it was the first time in two months I saw someone outside of my family. I also have an older brother but he doesn't leave the house, he hasn't gone visit my father in all this time and he only just eats what I cook and leaves everything dirty. I have a room rented somewhere else, I came here when all of this started and I really want to leave, but there are two cats at my parents's place who are being a big emotional support for me and who would die if I left because my brother wouldn't feed them.

I have a long distance girlfriend and I'm not going to see her this Christmas because my mum can't handle all this shit alone. But I also can barely call her and I miss her. I've struggled with depression since I was 9 years old and right now I only want to sleep all day. I'm so fucking tired of pretending I'm stronger than I am.",1,1765128893.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I have always fell asleep very easily. Ive heard stories from when i was little that i fell asleep in the pool. I had fell asleep in the middle of an exam while writing something mid-sentence. Fell asleep in a crowded restaurant. I always fall asleep in class through out high school. In church since forever, like within 2 minutes of sitting down. No matter what i do, coffee, prior naps before my service (i go to a morning service, so i woke up earlier, get ready, try to tire myself out, then take a nap and wake up as close as the service time as possible), go to different service time, even had a lollipop, but ive only ever succeeded like a handful of times (ard 5 times). Also a bunch of times in high school i would be half asleep during exam and write down nonsense (answer in another language, write about random things, etc.)

Have went to a neurologist (once like early 2025) who ordered an mri to rule out other stuff, and told me i had narcolepsy based on my stories. But i heard its not enough for a diagnosis. He had not ordered any other test.

So right now im saving up for a sleep test. However i have a question, i found out about cataplexy being a symptom of narcolepsy, and i’m wondering if i have that. I do fell a lot growing up and drop a lot of stuff, and some time i do feel it happens when i’m laughing. But honestly im not getting rid of the possibility of confirmation bias. My question is, is it possible to detect the cataplexy only with a sleep test or is a spinal cord water tap thing is needed for that?

Also im still not quite sure on where to go once i have saved up enough money for the test. Do i go to the emergency department? Or do i talk to my psychiatrist (i have ocd) about this issue? 

Also, Is getting a diagnosis worth it? I imagine feeling relieved to finally know for sure if this is a medical problem or just regular sleepiness, but I’m not sure. Can anyone share how it feels after you get a diagnosis?

But the twist is that the café has a little farm or greenhouse area behind it, where coffee plants are grown. You take care of the plants, harvest the beans, roast them, and then use those beans to make drinks for customers.

There are no NPC workers and no instant deliveries. If you need supplies like sugar, milk, cups, or snacks, you actually get into a small truck, drive to the nearby town, and buy everything yourself from shops. The gameplay is built around a daily routine: checking on the plants in the morning, roasting beans, opening the café, serving customers, closing for the day, and making supply runs when needed.

The overall vibe is meant to be slow, cozy, and immersive — warm lighting, rainy evenings, simple conversations with regulars, and a quiet rural setting. It mixes a small farming loop with a hands-on café experience and slice‑of‑life atmosphere.",2,1765128204.0,GameDevelopersOfIndia,11,1.0,False

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message and introduce yourself !

1pgntwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pgntwe/dream_walker/,Dream walker,"Dream, dreamer, dream for it is but a glimpse beyond mortality.

Ever since I was a kid, I could not recall the dreams that came forth to me whilst in nocturnal's sweet embrace. Later in life, my father would tell me tales of my bouts of night terrors, to which he claimed I would wake up screaming so loudly as to awaken the entire town of Carthridge. I recall the years of sleepless nights he spoke of, when I'd wake up on the brink of midnight in sweats, screaming my voice hoarse. Those nights, when I would remain in bed, afraid to fall asleep. I could not recall my nightmares, but the pit in my stomach taught me to fear sleep.

I recall the worst and final night of my night terrors. I had once more woken up my father to anguished screams. This time, he found me in bed, lying in my own blood. He looked me over and found many deep scratch marks running the length of my back. The wounds required stitches and were ultimately dismissed as self-inflicted due to my nightmares. They didn't come again after that night. Not for many years.

They are back now, and so I find myself waking throughout the night drenched in sweat. I haven't properly slept in many nights and find myself wearing down. I called my father, who recommended to me the sleep therapist who'd treated me as a kid after my incident.

I walked up the narrow staircase to her office. I knocked on the door, and it thumped as it was pushed against its frame before being pulled open. An older woman with messy, wild, white hair stood there, in a neat, pressed beige suit jacket and dress.

“Hi, I'm Dr.Zakrowsky. It's nice to meet you. Sorry about the door, I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.”

 She led me into the room, making her way around a large desk. It was a neat room with the exception of a black and silver robe that was splayed across a plain white couch. Despite the neat appearance of the room and her clothes. The dirt under her fingernails and messy appearance were all too distracting.  

“So how can I help you today?” She asked as I sat in a chair before her desk.

“Same thing we spoke on the phone about. My night terrors are back.”

“Ah, yes, and when's the last time you had these night terrors?”

“When I last came to see you, when I was ten. Don't you have my file?”

“We lost some files while digitalizing everything. I'd like to try a new solution I've been hearing about. It'll seem a little fringe, but I've heard nothing but great things. I'd like to take a herbalist approach to this solution. You see, some cultures believe that some herbs can ease the consumer into sleep, allowing them to have a more relaxed sleep, reducing the chances of night terrors, and that's what I was hoping we could try today.” 

When she finished speaking, she opened the top drawer of her desk and pulled out a small pouch of herbs.

“You can make it into a tea and drink it before going to bed. Anywho, that'll be it for today. I'll be in contact with you in a couple of days to see how everything's coming along.”I thanked her as she hurried me out the door.

When dusk came, light retreated, and night's darkness fell upon the town. I made the sweet-smelling tincture, which smelled of roses and rosemary. As it came to my tongue, I was met with a sweet, silky smooth taste that slid its way down my gullet, warming me from the inside. The effects were immediate, and I flopped loosely onto my bed, as though I had been drugged. I looked out my window and saw the snow gently falling. I sank into my bed like quicksand, slowly sinking deeper and deeper, until all light was cut off. In the void, I saw a ray of light, growing closer and closer. The ground spat me out, and I found myself lying on a soft, cold bed of snow in Carthridge's town square. The night sky was a black ever ever-expanding void, empty of any light. The only light around me came from the street lights. The town was still and silent, the only sound was the whistling wind rushing through the empty streets. I looked around for any sign of life, but found none.

Months have passed, and the snow has gone.  I've walked the streets, searched homes, only to find them empty. Entire homes and apartment complexes were hollowed out like husks as though they served as nothing more than set dressing. My apartment complex was the only building that was normal. My room was the same as it had always been. Although I could open none of the other doors in the building, no matter how hard I bashed into them, the cheap doors would not budge. One day, out of desperation, I walked along the highway out of Carthridge. I walk for hours only to end up walking straight back towards town as though the road had looped around. I've tried so many times, but I just end up walking right back into town.

Still, I remain, and I am alone for this place is devoid of all life. I feel as though I am the first star in the night sky, stuck in an empty void, isolated and so far removed from all existence. This oblivion I find myself trapped in is stuck in perpetual darkness. I often find myself reminiscing on the sun's light, missing its warmth upon my skin. I've given up all hope. I have tried so hard to escape, but there is no way out. I'm tired, so very tired, and I see no other way. I look at the interior of the decrepit shack I found myself in after my last escape attempt. I kick the chair out from underneath me and feel the rope constrict around my neck like a boa. It digs into my skin harshly as I thrash, gasping for air to no avail. I feel the veins in my eyes pop as an intense pressure grows in my head. My head is hot as though it is on fire, as all the blood pools in my face. I flail for hours until I am weak and all energy has been sapped from my body. Death does not come for me, and a single tear rolls down my cheek as the wind gently rocks my body back and forth. 

I believe many more months have passed since. Months in complete isolated silence, staring at the door that stands right before me. Time feels as though it has stood still, if not for the snow that has come once more, blanketing the outside in a powdery, glistening white. The harsh cold has penetrated me down to the bone. It wasn't long before the cold turned into a burning heat, and my body felt as though it had been enveloped in flames. I had long since given up when the crunching sound of footsteps in the snow. A man walked in, his skin was smooth and unblemished, his eyes were brilliant marvels of starlight. Our eyes met, and I was at once filled with the hope of freedom, but the hope was soon crushed when he turned and walked out the door, leaving me to hang. The crushing feeling had been worse than any before to be so close to freedom, to have it dangle before me, only to be torn away. Left to my own fate. Tears froze on my cheeks as they came. 

The wind picked up, and the cabin groaned loudly. Within the hour, a blizzard had set upon me, moving the shack with every gust. It proved to be too much for the tired, old roof, the weight of the snow and my own caused it to collapse, releasing me but trapping me under rubble. Air rushed into my gasping lungs, filling them with the burning, bitter cold air they'd gone so long without. I cried, tears running coolly down my cheeks as I moaned painfully, my voice frail and raspy. I was shocked at the sound of my own voice. A million pins and needles spread through my body like wildfire, filling me with excruciating pain as blood circulated once more. The rubble insulated me from the frigid cold, and my body began to thaw.

Days passed before I had thawed enough to move. I brought my hands slowly up to my face and strangely found no trace of frostbite. I inched forward ever so slightly. Day by day, my unused muscles were weak and nearly useless. The cold had relented, and so after many days, I stood like a newborn standing on his own two feet for the first time. I was freed, and I wobbled my way out on unsteady legs that shook like jello. The pain was blinding, but I pushed forth until I reached my apartment and made it to my room, where I wrapped myself in blankets and felt a comforting warmth for the first time in many, many months. I stayed in my apartment recovering patiently.

When I felt well enough to leave again, another month had passed. As I left my building, I was made aware of many tracks in the deep snow that went to my window before stopping. Many were hardly visible and had been there a while. One set was deeper. They went to my window like the rest, then in the direction of the woods. Desperate to find anyone who may know a way out, I followed them deep into the looming forest. It led all the way to a strange clearing. There was a tall, smooth stone in the middle. I lost all train of thought, my attention was drawn to it, and I walked over. I put my hand on its smooth surface, and it was warm and humming beneath its surface. The incessant wind stood still. For the first time since I arrived here, I looked up and saw a mass of writhing constellations, clusters of bright, beautiful colors dancing inside the mass as it opened its many nebulous eyes and looked down upon me. I heard the crashing of trees and, like thunder before lightning, the deafening roar of hundreds of thousands of voices screaming all at once.

A writhing mass of flesh, limbs, cloths, silks, and leathers. The inorganic matter melding with the organic. It came crashing forth from the tree line. Hundreds and thousands of people all melted into one. A hundred thousand heads, their eyes glowing with the incandescence of the stars. Their voices screaming, groaning and moaning all at once in perfect unison. It was making its way over to me fast. It slammed into trees, sending them careening every which way. I ran, but the snow was so deep my legs moved through it like tar. It was reaching me, and no matter how much I tried, I could hardly run fast enough to get away. I could hear it reaching me, it was not but twenty feet away when I tripped. Closer and closer. It set upon me now inches away as I screamed.

“MICKEY, MICKEY”

My father was standing over me, shaking me. 

“Jesus Christ, kid, you scared the fuck out of me.” He looked completely out of breath, fear-laden in his pale face.

“What's going on?” I asked in a daze

“No one's seen you in two days, Mickey. Your work called me asking if I'd seen you. You're not answering your phone, so I came here, and I find you screaming like a fucking banshee in your sleep. You scared the shit out of me, kiddo.” His body seemed to be at ease when he saw I was alright. 

“Probably just another nightmare. Can I go back to bed?” I replied dismissively 

“Yeah, sure, kiddo. I'll be downstairs when you wake back up.”

I've never had a coffee that tastes less like coffee. It's delicious! If I was really craving some coffee flavor and someone served this to me, I would be a tad irritated, but I was up for an adventure so didn't go into it with any expectations. This isn't the fruitiest coffee I've ever had, but that's definitely the main flavor. Very citrusy, very floral, a tiny bit sweet, a tiny bit juicy. But nothing was overpowering. Just a lot of fun, bright, acidic flavors going on. Tasting notes on the box are spot on. 

Recipe I used:

* Rao/Perger water at 94 degrees​
* 10g coffee ground at a 5 on K-Ultra (much finer than I grind for v60) 
* Deep 27 with Abaca filter
* 30g bloom for 30 seconds
* 3x 40g pours just waiting for water to reach the bed before another pour 

  
I did a little swirling here and there to make sure the bed settled, but nothing too violent. I brewed the same coffee with a Weber BIRD and got a very similar flavor profile.

**Why This Pick?**

The lines for this game don’t make a ton of sense at first glance – not the spread and certainly not the total. The Falcons have put at least 23 points on the board in 4 of their last 5 games, and the Seahawks have put at least 26 in the bag in 4 of their last 5. I know Seattle’s defense has been formidable at home (they shut Minnesota out 26-0 last week…) but they’re not nearly as unshakeable on the road. This total should fall comfortably beyond 44.0 – I’m on the Over to hit.

I was waiting for the microwave to finish heating my lunch when my coworker Maya walked in, stared at me for a second, and said:

“You give off strong otter energy.”

I thought she was joking, so I laughed. She didn’t laugh.

She proceeded to explain in detail that she’s been “observing my aura for weeks,” and she has finally “confirmed my spirit animal.” She then pulled out a handmade otter sticker and put it on my laptop like she was knighting me.

Later that afternoon she sent a company-wide Slack message welcoming me to “The Otter Clan.”

People started reacting with emojis. My manager even wrote “Congrats??”

Today I came in and she had taped a picture of an otter on my chair.

I don’t know how to tell her that:

1. I did not consent to being spiritually classified,

2. I don’t want to be in a Clan at work,

3. And I definitely do not want otters multiplying on my desk.

I just bought a brand new Eureka Mignon Zero 55s from Coffee Friend.

I found the zero point and set everything up. The grinder was delivered with the king-size wheel (reaching 0–19/20), and it's now set to 0.25 (almost at the zero point), but the coffee extraction is still far too fast, resulting in an awful-tasting espresso.

Currently, I'm using a single dose of 13.5 g of beans, but the extraction is completed in 10–13 seconds.

Are the burrs damaged or misaligned? I don't want to adjust anything in case I invalidate the warranty, and it seems strange to me that new grinders would have misaligned burrs.  
I might have to add that when I first started the grinder I couldn't hear any buzzing noise from the burrs. 

Anyway, I'd appreciate any help from you guys.

Every major company I interviewed with, I walked away with a job offer, often with a salary starting above 28K. But this isn't luck; it's a specific routine I follow before any interview.

So, this is the direct method I use to prepare:



1. DECODE THE JOB LISTING

Consider the job listing (JL) your primary guide for any interview. Honestly, every answer you'll need, and even the questions they'll ask, are hidden there. I'm serious, everything is in the details.

Spending time with the JL helps you gather all the material you'll need for those tricky behavioral and situational questions.

I always use an AI tool (like Gemini or ChatGPT) to do this. Try prompts like:

""Take this \[Job Listing\] and explain the key responsibilities.""

""Extract potential interview questions based on this \[Job Listing\].""



2. MASTER YOUR RESUME

Your resume got you in, right? Something in it caught their eye. Figure out what that 'something' is and practice talking about it in a way that truly makes you stand out.

Let's say you're interviewing for a Project Coordinator role. They'll expect strong organizational and communication skills from you. So, when you practice your answers, make sure you link them to specific points in your resume that demonstrate your ability to manage timelines or help team discussions.

Again, AI can help here (ChatGPT is excellent):

""What are the essential skills required for a \[Job Title\] role?""

""Suggest past academic projects or volunteer work from my \[Resume Summary\] that aligns with this \[Job Title\].""



3. UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY WELL

You don't need to every single detail about the company. That's overkill! Just focus on two key things: exactly what they do, and what their workplace atmosphere or culture is like.

Memorizing a few keywords is the simplest way to retain this information. For example, if you're looking at Starbucks, your keywords might be ""coffee retail"" (what they do) and ""community-focused"" (their culture). When they ask what you know about Starbucks or why you want to join, simply incorporate these keywords into a genuine and coherent answer.

A quick Google search or asking an AI (like Claude) for ""\[Company Name\] mission and workplace values"" usually yields the desired result.

So, before you go to that interview, just remember to ask yourself: Analyze the listing, scrutinize your resume, and know the company. This focused preparation truly makes a big difference. It helps you stay steady and confident, turning interview anxiety into a good job offer. I wish you all the best in your job search journey!

I have a few interests, mainly video games! I'm really into Destiny 2 right now (Renegades has pulled me back in 🤣), CoD, RoR 2, Gunfire Reborn, Sonic Racing Crossworlds, Borderlands 4, etc. just what ive been bouncing around in. But honestly i love to play a whole bunch of stuff. Please I can yap about it for hours sheesh.

I am also into tech, I love tinkering and just looking at new stuff coming out. I usually don't BUY a lot of tech but bleeding edge stuff is never cheap 🤣, ill give it a couple years. But old stuff is really what im into, i love just seeing what communites do with older consoles and the advancements made to preserve and modernize a lot of these systems! I could talk about Bad Update for hours its such cool stuff honestly 😁.

I'm also into Cooking, Ive been dabbling in baking but its so much harder than i thought! Starting to get into working out and things a bit more i just want to try to take care of my body and all that good stuff. I love love LOVE coffee and tea, i have a few means to make them but i love just drinking them and finding new flavors to try tea truly heals my soul. 

But there's always more and id love to talk about it :), just shoot me a message! I work during the day so things may be staggered a bit but id love to get to know you! Sorry if i don't get to you right away :(.

1pgncf1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgncf1,"Offroaders, consider volunteering for rally!","Rally racing doesn't happen without offroaders, radio operators, and other car related nerds. I just finished volunteering as a radio blocker for my third rally and what an experience. 

Thursday I broke trail in a foot of untouched snow, Friday I ran 80 km of some of the most beautiful winter trails, adding tape and signage, then spent the evening watching the cars launch at Thunder Mountain Raceway while fans shot fireworks into the sky

Saturday I woke up on a remote trail all alone and made myself a French press coffee with baileys until the stage started, and there I was with the best seat in the house all to myself with snow softly falling and engines roaring as the competitors passed. 

Then another 50 km to stage two, assisting a ditched spectator vehicle, getting sideways multiple times in the soft snow, clearing a downed tree with another blocker, then finding a creative parking solution for my second position which was now two feet deep of untouched snow. 

Every moment was beautiful, fun, and slightly sketchy, just the way some of us like it. 

So if you're lucky enough to have a rally course near you, it's a great way to get out and support a really fun event, get creative with your driving, be awesome while helping vehicles with less clearance, and you might even get your gas paid for depending on how it's organized. 

The only downside is I was white knuckling it all weekend so I got like five pictures, go see social media for Beast Sweep or Big White Winter Rally to see better stuff, I'm just giddy today and sharing in case any other offroaders don't know this is a thing. 

Volunteers needed include average joes willing to do parking or crowd control, or drive around putting up tape and signs, HAM operators, medics, and recovery vehicles. Every body is appreciated!

• The Neighbours  We’ve lived next door for years but barely talk… until one small incident forces us into each other’s lives.
• Friends-to-Something-More Late-night texts slowly turning into confessions neither of us expected.
• Travel Companions  Two strangers share a train berth by mistake, and the journey changes everything.
• Workplace Slow Burn The new hire… and the person asked to train them. Lots of tension.
• Slice of Life + Flirt  Coffee shops, midnight walks, banter, stolen moments.

I asked the crew about it and they were so kind. They said the warm air was meeting the cold air plus mountain ranges makes for a bumpy ride often. They were serving coffee while we shook non-stop.

The whole “European café-style hangout spot” idea isn’t new. Starbucks just figured out how to make it mainstream and insanely popular.

When I study brands in general, I try to look for what lesson I can take from them. So when I heard Starbucks was struggling, my first assumption was that people just got tired of the gimmicks. I had two theories and neither turned out to be fully right.

**Theory 1: The “flavor of the week” burnout**

I thought maybe people were only interested in Starbucks for the constant new flavors, the same way people hype up places like Cheesecake Factory or Crumbl Cookie.

In my mind, brands that last are the ones that find something people love and stick to it. A dramatic example? Raising Cane’s. They do basically one thing, chicken tenders and they do it ridiculously well. They’re growing so fast they might actually outpace Chick-fil-A and KFC. Wild.

So I figured maybe Starbucks lacked a core product. But that isn’t really true. They do have iconic products like the Pumpkin Spice Latte. People literally wait for that drink every year. So variety itself isn’t the problem.

**Theory 2: The name-misspelling gimmick**

The second theory was the meme of Starbucks intentionally misspelling names on cups. It created tons of UGC (User Generated Content), and supposedly, once Starbucks realized this, they leaned into it on purpose.

It was a clever gimmick, sure. But realistically, that alone isn’t enough to build a global mega-brand. It’s fun, but it isn’t a foundation.

So why is Starbucks really in decline?

Short answer: **The vibe is off.**

Starbucks was never just about coffee. It was the “third place.” Not home, not work. You go there between those lives.

If you worked remotely, you could sit there for hours, surrounded by the soft chaos of espresso machines, quiet chatter, and that cozy, not-in-a-rush atmosphere. It felt better than a cubicle, and definitely better than being stuck around gossiping co-workers.

It was also a chill friend hangout spot, or a casual date location. Not fancy. Not loud. Just in-between. That in-between is what made Starbucks special.

Then 2020 hit. Nobody could go to their third place anymore.

Starbucks was built on indoor experience, so they had to pivot. The digital ordering system basically saved them. Drive-thrus boomed. Mobile orders took over. 

When people finally could go out again, they didn’t return to the third place, because it wasn’t there anymore.

The vibe had evaporated.

Starbucks kept prioritizing digital speed instead of cozy space. Without that signature atmosphere, Starbucks became… well, just another place to buy coffee. And not cheap coffee either.

You could justify $8 coffee when it came with a mini-vacation. But $8 for something you just pick up and leave with? That’s a harder sell.

Today, Starbucks is trying to bounce back. Their new CEO, Brian Niccol (the guy who helped revive Chipotle), wants to bring back the old magic. Maybe he will. Maybe he won’t. Right now, it’s too early to say.

**The lesson here**

Adapting to outside forces is important Starbucks did that well. But you can’t abandon what made your brand special just because a new method seems easier or works for a moment.

Identity matters. People don’t fall in love with your product alone, they fall in love with what it means.

Lose that, and you blend in with everyone else. Even if you still sell great coffee.",6,1765126219.0,branding,6,0.87,False

1pgmzpx,https://i.redd.it/7edabx6p9t5g1.png,Resume Review + Industry Fit,"[](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/?f=flair_name%3A%22Breaking%20In%22)I'm an Australian Citizen currently finishing my second year of four years (entering penultimate) at the University of Melbourne . I'm doing a mathematics, economics and finance degree, and I thought I'd reach out for some help.

I've applied to an array of internships across IB/Quant/Consulting/PE and have seen very limited success. I assume there are issues with my Resume that I can't identify. I've used AI feedback quite a bit in the refinement process, but I don't feel like I'm quite there yet.

I was wondering:

* Is my resume competitive enough for Australian banking internships (CBA, ANZ, NAB, Westpac) going into my penultimate year?
* Is there a specific industry that my resume seems to cater to? I'd love to do Quant, but feel as if I'm just not at the necessary level.
* Does my resume present too technically focused? (ChatGPT keeps pushing this narrative)
* Is my WAM (75,73) Competitive enough? (Equivalent to 3.5-ish GPA)
* Is there any chance of breaking into the US markets graduate job market without contacts and working rights?
* Should I move my maths major above eco + finance? I worry that employers will undervalue it as equivalent to a maths degree. (15 math subjects to complete)
* Generally, how do you perceive my resume?

Please let me know any other changes to my resume I should make.

Finally, my current role, Financial Analyst, is a hybrid of an internship and a junior role based in Prague, as I'm in the Czech Republic for an exchange. I may continue the role when I return to Australia; however, online only.

The work itself is at an owner-funded VC but expanding into PE soon. It's a small firm, and as a result, I have strong exposure to all parts of the process (DD, founder meetings, ticket size discussion, term negotiation). Additionally, I've met a really broad array of ex-F500 company higher-ups who are branching into their own startups. This is in large part due to my boss's strong industry connections and reputation.

How should I present this, as I feel like employers may undervalue the exposure if I don't represent it adequately?

Hey everyone. I’m 33 and born and raised in Michigan. I’ve never really posted here before, but I’m trying to branch out and meet new people to chat with, vibe with, and hopefully build some simple, genuine connections.

A little about me:
I’m big into anything outdoors when the weather’s good like  hiking, kayaking, camping, all that good stuff. Once winter hits though, I fully switch into homebody mode. Give me reading, good coffee, TV show binges, and warm cuddles with the right person and I’m set.

I’m a friendly, laid back guy who can get pretty goofy once I’m comfortable. I love sarcasm and I’m always down for good conversation, whether it’s light, funny, or deeper “talk for hours” type stuff.

If you’re looking for someone to chat with, get to know, share random thoughts with, or just build a chill friendship, feel free to message me.

I called my boyfriend earlier and it was fine, but it wasnt us, if that makes sense. he sounded distracted, and i kept trying to fill the silence with random travel stories. after we hung up i just sat there feeling stupidly unsure, like im holding onto something thats slipping through my fingers, slowly enough that i can pretend it isnt happening.

When i got back to the hostel, i watched the sunset from the courtyard. it was one of those soft, peachy ones that shouldve made me feel calm, but instead it made me feel small in a way i dont totally hate. like the world is big and im just figuring out my place in it one day at a time.

IDK. Some nights i feel really proud of myself for doing this trip alone. and other nights, like tonight, i kinda wish someone was right here with me to tell me im not messing everything up.

1pgmy74,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1pgmy74/my_transgender_friend_got_a_binder/,My transgender friend got a binder :),"I’m from a conservative Arab background. Still have some old fashioned beliefs. But I’m trying to be open minded because the LGBT+ community have shown me so much support, wanting my country to be free and stuff.

A while ago, I also made a new friend personally. He is a trans man. I didn’t understand it at first, but he explained some things and it made a bit of more sense. I’m muslim, and he explained how he was not a believer but likely Allah knows he is a man in his heart, so the wrong thing would actually be pretending he is a lady. Makes sense. I had a big realisation that day.

Redditors also gave me some advice on how to support him.

Anyways, it has been a few days since that post. We plan to meet up and have coffee and stuff soon. A day when I’m off work. Just to talk and “hang out,” without a big politics chat. Not because I’m not curious about other things, and I do think politics is important, but just because I realised transgender people are just normal people. They exist outside of my politics curiosities. He collected my number because he just wants to be chill friends with me, likely. 

But before we meet up, we’ve been texting a bit. He told me he finally received a chest binder from the internet.  I wondered what that was. He explained to me carefully. He knows I am quite religious, so don’t want to hear detailed stuff about people’s bodies. So he manages to explain in a way that’s appropriate. I can’t remember rvery word. But it was something like. 

“Okay so you know how most men and women have different shapes of chest?”

And I said “yes.”

And he  said “well. I identify as a man. But I have a chest *most* women have.”

He told me about dysphoria a few days ago. So I realised where this was going. Sort of. So I said:

“Oh. And I’m assuming that makes you sad sometimes?”

He said “yes.”

And then he explained what a chest binder does. Flattens chest. It is not dangerous always, only if you wear wrong size or wear for too long. Then he sent me the short video. He was in his normal clothes. But chest binder underneath. And wow. Just wow. 

His eyes were lighting up in the video. So bright. His smile was wide. So wide. He made little sounds of excitement, looking at himself in the phone camera. He said after: “I feel like I’m going from a boy to a real man like everybody else my age.” Or at least something like that. I felt so unbelievable happy for him. 

Back in my home country, we were under seige, so it is not like religious judgements were our biggest priority. But I did sometimes hear things. About transgender people. Conservative, old fashioned ideas. I never once thought, years anf years of time later, i would know a transgender man personally. Or that I could feel so happy about his gender euphoria. Never thought. 

But I want to go back to that sentence he said. Something like “I feel like I’m going from a boy to a real man my age.” It reminded me of something. I knew a guy in my home city. Not personally. I never talked to him. But I heard him talked about. He did not hit puberty like us. Did not get to become a physically grown man. He was something like 20s, but looked like a 13 year old boy in some ways.

He had to see lots of different doctors. They knew quickly his body was not making testosterone. But didn’t know what to do about it. Some doctors in the city, some in the richer country next to us. They knew they could prescribe him testosterone. It was possible. But possible did not mean morally good. Certain medical practices are… tricky and complicated. When it comes to religion. 

In the end,and after some praying and discourse, they decided to at least try the testosterone thing. Low dose to start. Injection in arm. Higher dose depending on how it went.

I don’t know all the details of his medical story. Only heard through rumours passed around and some news interviews that ended up in papers. 

But i knew he ended up feeling happier. So much happier. Like a real man. He found it easier to date ladies (he is Christian, not Muslim. So dating is permissible). He was taken more seriously. 

He is not exactly the same as my transgender friend, maybe. At least he was always seen the same as his gender. He was a male according to doctors at birth. But still… frustrated at his body. His body did not represent him. Medical help made him feel better. Helped his whole life.

My transgender friend put on the chest binder and felt represented. He smiled so big. That specific quote about “boy to man” just really reminded me of the man from my town. 

A binder is not a medical transition. But my transgender friend might start medical transition soon. He said: “I will after a few months, most likely.” Or something like that. I supported that man from my town. So I think I support medical transition for my friend.

I’m really happy about his new chest binder. So happy. Just happy because he is.

I just wanted to share that joy for you folks. Some people think my country is all homophobic and transphobic. “Throwing gay people off roofs.” Religious conservative ideas are big there, but we are people like you. We have problems. We struggle. Even with gender. Like that man’s puberty problem. And for me personally, I learned to tolerate and even kind of love the LGBT community a bit. 

I just wanted to share, I suppose. You all mostly have supported freeing my country. I support you, in return. That is humanity. And that is Islam. Salaam, dears 💕✌🏽",17,1765125909.0,lgbt,3,0.9,False

1. Vaseline - OG lipbalm/mask. I wear it on the days I want something light, at night mostly. It’s clear, fragrance free and comfortable. I also wear this before applying lipstick, and on top of lipstick or with a lipliner too sometimes. It’s really nice. 10/10.

2. Laneige lip mask - I only use this at night. It can be light or heavy depending on how much you apply. I apply it a bit more and wake up with plump lips. It’s good, but has fragrance and can be a bit overpowering. If you’re into their range of lip masks, which are all fragranced btw, so pick it carefully. 8.5/10 

3. Hyphen - I hate most things about this. The texture, taste and the formula. I did however recently see that they have a new formulation, so I’m yet to try it. This smells like chocolate and I hate it for some reason probably because it’s overpowering. I wear this with a brown liner for a natural look or on top of a dry matte lipstick. It’s okay, bought it after seeing the hype. 5/10 

4. Inde wild - The brand is spoken about everywhere, it’s a good brand. I also use the Champi hair oil, but it’s a bit overpriced. The lip balm too, looks similar to Hyphen but has a far better Peptides and Squalane formulation compared to Hyphen. The price can be lower, it retails for ₹899. It’s discounted on Amazon however. It has has a mild coffee fragrance but if you want something fragrance free, they also have a clear, fragrance free lipbalm. 9/10

5. Laneige again - I love their lip products honestly. This has a really good formula and gives glass lips. I wear it with a brown lip liner and add this as a topper, it looks amazing. You can use any liner or lipstick, as this one is clear but has a mild vanilla fragrance. I don’t think Laneige has any fragrance free lip balms too. 10/10 

6. Wishcare - Wishcare isn’t that great of a brand but their hair serum and the ceramide lip balm is good. I use this at night too and also before I wear lipstick, it keeps the lips hydrated. It did make my lips slightly brighter after 6 months of use, but nothing else. It has shea butter, which is really good for the lips and smells like shea butter but the fragrance is very mild. 9/10

It defines a mind that is constantly buzzing, calculating, and talking a total inability to chill out.

The biggest problem is that you think your feelings instead of feeling them. Your mind's dual nature means that every emotional moment is immediately split into two debates: ""Should I?"" and ""What's the smart way?"" This scattering means the mind is never settled or fully committed to an emotion or a decision.

The free will: This constant agitation is a karma machine. Because your mind moves so fast and sees so many options (free will), every single thought and casual word you drop becomes a potential action. You are constantly initiating new paths, new gossips, new schemes, new connections.

1pgmu6z,https://i.redd.it/1n55nob55t5g1.png,Resume Review + Pathway Questions (Australia),"I'm an Australian Citizen currently finishing my second year of four years (entering penultimate) at a top Australian Uni (the University of Melbourne). I'm doing a mathematics, economics and finance degree, and I thought I'd reach out for some help.

I've applied to an array of internships across IB/Quant/Consulting/PE and have seen very limited success. I assume there are issues with my Resume that I can't identify. I've used AI  feedback quite a bit in the refinement process, but I don't feel like I'm quite there yet.

I was wondering:

* Is my resume competitive enough for Australian banking internships (CBA, ANZ, NAB, Westpac) going into my penultimate year?
* Is there a specific industry that my resume seems to cater to? I'd love to do Quant, but feel as if I'm just not at the necessary level.
* Does my resume present too technically focused? (ChatGPT keeps pushing this narrative)
* Is my WAM (75,73) Competitive enough? (Equivalent to 3.5-ish GPA)
* Is there any chance of breaking into the US markets graduate job market without contacts and working rights?
* Should I move my maths major above eco + finance? I worry that employers will undervalue it as equivalent to a maths degree. (15 math subjects to complete)
* Do International firms value the University of Melbourne's reputation? Although it's ranked 13th globally, I've heard international firms discount non-US or UK reputation heavily
* All my coding experience is self-taught; however, I did self-study and completed those projects with very minimal AI help. Is it worth me developing my coding skills more? I was thinking of studying C and then systems architecture. Is there something else I should look into self self-studying?
* Generally, how do you perceive my resume?

Please let me know any other changes to my resume I should make.

Finally, my current role, Financial Analyst, is a hybrid of an internship and a junior role based in Prague, as I'm in the Czech Republic for an exchange. I  may continue the role when I return to Australia; however, online only.

The work itself is at an owner-funded VC but expanding into PE soon. It's a small firm, and as a result, I have strong exposure to all parts of the process (DD, founder meetings, ticket size discussion, term negotiation). Additionally, I've met a really broad array of ex-F500 company higher-ups who are branching into their own startups. This is in large part due to my boss's strong industry connections and reputation.

How should I present this, as I feel like employers may undervalue the exposure if I don't represent it adequately?

Then 2 days ago I decided to restart my island on one switch so that I could still keep my island and I decided to do it on my switch 2. I deleted the save data and started my new island. Today I wanted to check on my old island (Hawaii) and it put me on the screen with Timmy and Tommy introducing themselves at the airport and then I realised that I screwed up. So now I have lost it forever since I didn’t do any backups. It was an island that I started on Christmas 2021 and did it slowly with no treasure islands or people giving me things except once where I got money from another player and used it to pay off my home loan but then it felt wrong to use it so I put it in my savings and when I lost it there was about 800 000 bells still there.

Every single day at least ten people message me privately. Someone is scared because they are not getting married. Someone cannot find a job. Someone’s parent is sick. Someone is confused about their direction in life. These people come with real pain, real fear, real uncertainty. And it hurts to see how easily scammers take advantage of that.

There is a type of “astrologer” online who charges 100, 200, 400, 500, even 700 rupees. They do not know anything about astrology. They are here for quick passive income. Reading a proper chart is not a five minute thing. If someone is being honest and genuinely going through your divisional charts, cross-checking timings, checking rectification, matching patterns, it easily takes 30 to 40 minutes. Sometimes even longer. So if someone is doing it for 500 rupees, you already know they are not actually reading anything. They are just giving generic lines to sound smart.

What scares me is not the money. Five hundred rupees is nothing, you won’t even remember it next week. What scares me is the confusion they put into your mind when you are already vulnerable. You might be going through a breakup, job loss, family crisis, marriage delay, mental health struggle. And someone who doesn’t understand astrology at all will say something random to you that stays in your mind for years. That is the real damage.

I have seen this pattern for too long. Years ago, the astrology community was peaceful and genuinely helpful. Slowly these scammers started multiplying. I personally got two of them removed. They were running small communities, promoting paid readings, and misleading hundreds of people. I directly contacted the admins, explained the pattern, showed screenshots, and both accounts got banned. That is how seriously I take the health of this community.

But recently I noticed the same behavior repeating under different names. Someone takes over an abandoned community, changes the description, and instantly starts advertising paid readings. Same strategy, same manipulation. They may even reply in your comment section pretending to “help”. Do not fall for it.

Please remember this. The moment you see an astrologer charging 100, 200, 400, 500, 700 rupees, just block and move on. No genuine astrologer charges like that. Traditional astrologers do donation based work. Serious astrologers charge proper fees because they spend real time reading charts. Only scammers charge small amounts because they depend on volume, not knowledge.

I care about you guys because I have been here long enough to see how people get hurt. I created my own space now because I cannot control every community, but at least I can warn you. Protect your mind. Protect your peace. And do not give your vulnerability to someone who has no idea what they are doing.

If you ever feel confused or unsure, ask questions to the community, ask people you trust, or go to a genuine reader whose work you have studied over time. Just don’t hand your life over to someone selling “readings” for the price of a coffee.",1,1765125065.0,Nakshtranadi,2,1.0,False

one thing i love and would be so excited to do regularly is play board games! get a drink (either a coffee drink or an alcoholic drink, depending on vibes) and play some games and have some friendly competition and get to know each other. there are a couple of board game social meetups in JC already- and they’re both great in their own ways- but one thing was constant every time i’ve gone : it was mostly men, and i got hit on every time. 

now before anyone comes at me with a pitchfork, i want to preface this by saying if I was single, i’d probably want to meet someone naturally at a cool event like a board game night. i’m not mad at people for shooting their shot- i just think there’s a need for a space without men, and i think that’s okay. the group will be open and inclusive, not age specific other than being 21+, but based on interest, it’ll be most attended by women in their mid 20s to early 30s. 

our first meetup will be a board game night once i find a location for it and we get enough interest. 

i created an instagram page for this! this is where i’ll be posting meetups and we can all talk in the comments. it’ll be a private page that you have to request to join for obvious reasons. please have a public profile with a photo on it. in the past, people have asked for info via Reddit but it’s hard for me to keep up and my private messages are constantly getting lost as i also use Reddit for work so i have hundreds of messages on here. so if you don’t have Instagram, I’d recommend you make one just for this group. I don’t want your message to get lost!! 

Also if you’re someone who wants to help run it and you’re willing to keep up with the Reddit side as well as helping run things and find places to host, please let me know. I want this to be less of a structured thing. I don’t want there to be a host or to be seen as a host. I want to make friends and I want us all to just meet and hang out.

the Instagram name is “ boardbabesJC” i thought it was a cute play on bored and boards, and i love babes (when women say it)

The street is silent, but every sound seems louder than it should be: distant footsteps, the wind rattling the windows, even the click of my own shoe on the wooden floor. I lock the door behind me and stare at the room, trying to convince myself that nothing strange has happened.

But I can't.

I call my friend because I needed someone to believe in me. He answers me with his usual calm voice. I start to count everything: the chairs moving by themselves, the marked dishes, the murmurs that I swear I heard. And he laughs.

""You're tired, man. First day, stress... you're seeing things where there's nothing.""

I try to argue, but the words seem to escape me. ""It's not just that, I swear… there's something wrong with the restaurant. I feel like he's… watching me.""

He sighs. ""Man, you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Breathe, go to sleep. Tomorrow you'll see better. You don't need to invent monsters where there aren't any.""

After the call, I feel strange, as if doubt has settled inside my head. Everything I was sure of before—the clock, the feeling in the restaurant, the murmurs—now seems questionable. Was it all in my mind?

But then I see something in the apartment that can't be ignored: the coffee cup I left on the table is on the floor. It didn't fall, there's nothing that pushed it. She just… moved places.

I sit on the couch, trying to breathe, trying to convince myself that I'm imagining it. But the feeling persists: something is watching me, even here, even alone. And I know that, sooner or later, I will need to go back to the restaurant. Because, in some way that I can't explain, I can't — and don't want to — move away from that place.",1,1765124919.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

So I had this random thought the other day. I was sitting at home, super bored on a Sunday evening, wanted to watch this new movie in theaters but none of my friends were free. Ended up not going because going alone felt weird.

This got me thinking - there must be tons of people in the same situation, right? Like you're bored, want to do something fun, but don't want to go solo to a movie.

**The idea**: An app where you can find someone nearby who wants to watch the same movie, same showtime. You match, chat for a bit to vibe check, then meet at the theater and watch together. No strings attached, just two people who both wanted to see the movie anyway.

# How I'm thinking it would work:

1. Open app → see movies playing in next 2-3 hours nearby
2. Pick one you want to see
3. See other people who also want to see it (with basic profiles)
4. Chat and confirm: ""Yeah let's catch the 7pm show""
5. Meet at theater lobby 15 mins before
6. Watch movie, maybe grab coffee after if you vibe, or just go your separate ways

**Safety stuff** (because I know this is important):

* Video verification for all profiles
* Rating system after each meetup
* Meet only at public theater locations
* Emergency contact sharing
* Can bring a friend along if nervous
* Both people have to confirm before sharing full details

**NOT a dating app** \- I want to be super clear about this. It's just about finding activity partners when you're bored. Like Uber for movie buddies.

# My questions for you:

1. Would you actually use something like this? Be honest.
2. What would make you trust meeting a stranger for a movie?
3. What features am I missing that would make this feel safe?
4. Is this just a stupid idea and I should go touch grass? 😅

I'm based in India (Kerala specifically) and thinking of building this. There's apps like this in the US apparently (ReeLoVe, Cinebond) but nothing really for India.

We booked the all inclusive plan - what they fail to mention is that you can only get draft beer. No bottled beer at all and cans are $480MX each. The only AI beer included is draft Dos X and another I’ve never heard of. You would have to buy cans of Modelo or Pacifica as they are not included.

The food says buffet but actually is cafeteria style as you can’t plate it yourself. It’s also not great food.

The description says 1 bar and 1 restaurant - but really they are the same thing. The bar is in the restaurant. There are only 8 seats at the bar counter and one of them is a stump as it has no seat.

The brochure says Wi-fi through out the property - but that is not true. The wi-fi is only in the lobby and doesn’t work most of the time and definitely not when it rains. No wi-fi in the room.

The rooms - so so tired. There is only 1 plug and it only works if you leave the lights on. If you want to charge your phone or use a cpap machine you have to unscrew the lightbulbs. The side of the bed with the only plug also has no nightstand. The couch is stained and covered in something.

There is no fridge and no coffee or tea in the room.

There is no screen on the balcony door.

In order to have a coffee in your room you have to go to the restaurant and get it and bring it back. They don’t have anyone to do room service and the restaurant doesn’t have any to go cups.

I fucked up things early on by lying to her multiple times out of fear. I know the reason doesn’t matter, because the damage is done.
The first lie was when I was on vacation and didn’t tell her I went out. I didn’t mention it in a call we had the day after, but then in a text message later on. She got mad I didn’t tell her earlier, because we agreed before I should tell her. I was scared of conflict, so I mentioned it later on, but thought it would not be such a big deal. Because she reacted like that, I got more scared and lied about drinking alcohol. I asked my friends to not tell her.
A day later she started to text me like crazy, said she can’t trust me and if I lied she’s going to pack her things. If I f*cked someone etc. That didn’t happen.
Then there was the topic of a guy I was seeing before her, casually, which I already ended before we started to date and told him I’m not interested in anything casual and we can be platonic friends since we got along. He wasn’t living in the same city and when me and my gf were dating, three months in, I had the idea to meet a last time for a coffee to tell him that I met someone. I wanted to do that to grow and confront myself with uncomfortable situations. No second thoughts. In the end it didn’t happen and contact was ended. Of course it’s completely shit I didn’t tell my girlfriend then.
When I was on this vacation two months later, I told her and she freaked out as well. She told me not to delete anything until I’m back and that she is sitting on packed bags already. She wouldn’t stop texting, flooding me with questions and accusations and causing me to panic, even though there wasn’t anything to panic about. But I was so afraid to lose her that in the end I deleted everything before coming back. Of course this was the biggest mistake I’ve ever done and I regret it so much. And I know it looks super fishy. Why would I delete something that wouldn’t be a problem? I know… but I just got so anxious that even the fact that I wanted to meet him for a coffee to tell that I’m in a relationship now would make her leave. Especially because she threatened multiple times with it.
I know this is extremely immature and I lied. I am taking full accountability on that. I apologized, I bought a software trying to restore it (didn’t work), I suggested writing him and asking him to get screenshots of the last conversation we had. She didn’t want to and implied I would manipulate them.
Ever since the relationship got really toxic. I offered access to my phone, putting on my location etc. but eleven months later it didn’t help and she said I have not repaired it. We are now at a point where she starts to call me names: „whore“, „only looking for big dick“.
When I forget to do things like she told me many times, for example putting events in our calendar every week (which I promised to do as a repair for the lies), she starts to get really mad with me. I am not good with being directly accountable and feel often attacked and get defensive. That’s when things get worse. She throws things on the floor, yells at me, calls me names and would not allow for a time out, even though I asked for it  multiple times. These fights go on for hours then and are very reactive. She then demands always immediate solutions and that I end the fights but I can’t. I just don’t feel safe and can’t even enter my logical brain anymore. Most of the time she threatens with kicking me out (I have my own place though) and also threatened many times to call the police. I noticed most of the time when I didn’t engage in the dynamic anymore. I see she is also overwhelmed then and it’s the only strategy she has to feel safe. I told her several times I am freezing and not able to think straight.
She often says she is autistic and this is how she expresses herself and I have to learn how to deal with it. That she has every right to call me this because I lied to her and treat her like shit because I didn’t repair it and keep on breaking my promises like putting events in our calendar which I didn’t do for the last two weeks after coming back from a trip. She says I am toxic and that I need to fix myself and learn how to be in a relationship.
I know I have made some big mistakes and that I probably destroyed the relationship with my actions, but when I want to break up and say I am taking responsibility by leaving because obviously I kept on hurting and make her feel unsafe, she starts to tell me that I should stop whining in self-pity and actually repair it instead of giving up. That she knew I would be this kind of phenotype that then just avoids and leaves. And that I don’t give a fuck about her. I always give in bc I don’t want to leave. I just sometimes feel so helpless. 
She also has a very rare medical condition and good hygiene standards are important. I gave her a clean plate (it was really clean, rinsed with extremely hot water at the end) but it still had a smell on it. She started to say it’s always the same shit with me and that I want to harm her and is endangering her life. That I will cause her infections with this shit. She then said a whore would do a better job than me as a partner. That she told me many times and I just don’t care.
I apologized and gave some space. Then she was nice to me again, we cuddled and watched something. When I wanted to go for a walk and the gym and asked her if she wants to join for the walk, she first said yes and then decided to say no. When I was about to leave, she started to say again that something is wrong with me and that I need to fix this otherwise she will kick me out. I said yes ok and that I will. Than she told me to fuck off. I told her please not to talk to me like this and she got mad again and said she has every right to do so. And if I complain one more time about the way she is talking (she says it’s because of her autism and because I do all of these shitty things) that we are done.
I know this is a long post and I guess all I want to know is if this okay what she is doing. I know I’m not the best when it comes to communication or talking about my feelings or getting back to things. And sometimes taking accountability immediately. And these are relationship skills one should have. But I don’t want to be treated like this anymore. It hurts me and makes me feel like I’m a horrible human. But I feel like I have no right to ask for that because I caused her all this pain with my lies. And I’m aware of the fact that I don’t have an outside perspective anymore. My suggestion for couple therapy got declined multiple times that bc of her medical problems she doesn’t have time for that and if I suggest it one more time she will end things bc bits inconsiderate Torwarts her health situation to ask her such thing.",1,1765124842.0,abusiverelationships,11,1.0,False

That's how all my drinks taste so good and my coworkers demand me make theirs.

1pgmcv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1pgmcv7/working_at_the_family_restaurant_part_2/,Working at the family restaurant [Part 2],"The first day at the restaurant starts early. The street is still quiet, but the smell of freshly brewed coffee and bread baking in the oven gives me a strange feeling of nostalgia. It's like the place is calling to me. I go in, and everything seems normal — tables lined up, the polished counter, the fluorescent lights flickering slightly. But even so, I feel like something isn't right.

The manager introduces me to the other employees, but none of them really look me in the eye. It's like I'm invisible, or like they're used to seeing me, but only as part of the scenery. I smile, greet everyone, but the feeling of being out of place doesn't go away.

In the middle of the morning, while I'm organizing some shelves, I hear a strange sound: a chair dragging itself. I turn around quickly, expecting to see someone, but the kitchen is empty. I shrug and continue my work, trying to ignore it. But the feeling of being watched doesn't leave me.

The weirdness increases when I grab a tray to take to the customers. One of the plates, which should be clean, has marks — as if someone had run their fingers over it, but no one was around. My heart races, and for a moment, I think about calling the manager. But when I look again, the plate is perfectly clean, as if nothing had happened.

During lunch, I notice little things that I can't explain: the wall clock seems to be spinning faster than normal, some words on the orders written by the customers change when I'm not looking directly, and there's a constant feeling of murmurs, as if the kitchen is full of voices that no one else hears.

When the shift ends, I'm exhausted, but something inside me prevents me from leaving with peace of mind. The restaurant isn't just a workplace. It's like it's alive, breathing with me, watching every step. And, as much as I want to rationalize everything, a part of me knows: I can't run away.

I have now decided that it's time to move on with my life and start eating normal food and everything again. Did acid watchers diet for 7 months, got rid of my cough and throat clearing and throat tightness forever, never came back despite eating all kinds of acidic food and coffee etc, still have a runny nose/mucus in nose (it's been improved but still there, manageable) and chronic post nasal drip (can barely tell it's there at all, super manageable) I can manage with guafenesin, there's never been any lpr damage to my throat even though I was eating junk and drinking carbonated drinks like sprite because I had to gain weight for the first 5 years, no idea what I had back then and still no damage to my larynx to this day, just all irritation symptoms and some have gone away forever now but I've decided that I'm okay with my symptoms from here on out. I hope you guys find a way out or a way to minimize symptoms to where you're comfortable and can eat anything again. I know a lot of people here have way worse symptoms with burning, globus and tons of damage in the larynx.
