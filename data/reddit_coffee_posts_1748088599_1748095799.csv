1kucfht,https://www.reddit.com/r/SimplyTelugu/comments/1kucfht/yes_or_no/,Yes or No,"Yes = అవును 

Is it! = అవునా! - avunā!

No / did not = లేదు - lēdu (in general)

Examples:

I don't have a bike - Naku bike lēdu.

I did not drink milk - Nēnu pālu tāgalēdu

>2. కాదు (kādu) – ""Is not"" / ""Are not""

Used to say something is not something. It negates identity or a fact.

 I acquired a property that has a detached garage with a small second story ADU.

* The property was built in **1952**.
* There is only **one entrance** through an exterior door up a flight of stairs.
* The place was rented for many years prior to my acquisition & is currently.
* I have an escape ladder stored in a box near the window in the bedroom.  (Think First alert rope ladder that connects to window SIL).
* The windows in the bedroom are sizeable.  It should be sufficient in size for egress?
* The place is small, maybe 500 to 600 sq ft.?
* I have a fire extinguisher in bedroom and in the kitchen.
* I have fire & carbon monoxide alarms in every room except the bathroom.



1. Would this likely meet code today?  
2. If not, is it grandfathered in?
3. Any improvements I should make?

1kuce4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Women/comments/1kuce4w/i_have_no_idea_how_to_start/,I have no idea how to start,"Hello! I (f39) have been married for 10 years and miserable for most of them. We have an amazing 8 year old son that deserves so much more than what he’s been getting in his home life. I am ready to get the divorce process started, but I feel like I don’t know how. I don’t have any family around to support me. I’ve pulled away from most of my friends, probably mostly because I was depressed and ashamed of my marriage. He’s (m47) been badmouthing me to everyone under the sun for YEARS, to his family, even to the baristas at the coffee shop we frequented, to the point that I won’t go there anymore. It’s been a reoccurring theme for him to tell me things like “everyone hates you, agrees with me, etc.” so my self-esteem is pretty low with all the gaslighting. I’ve called the cops on him twice in the last few years because he chased after me into my car and kicked and dented it and then another time where he physically harmed me. He blames me for both, telling me that I harmed our family by calling the police, convinced our son of the same thing. His family says I overreacted and act like I’m mentally ill or something because I called the police when I was afraid of him and wanted a record. He leaves printouts on my desk about different mental disorders he “thinks” I have. 
I’ve been saving my money for a while now. We don’t share finances because he’s self-employed and never tells me what he makes, has a credit card for his business that is always at risk for being past due, and never agrees on a budget. So I pay my portion of the bills and then save as much as I can. 
I have spoken to one lawyer so far. They have a flat fee to start, which they say usually covers most things and then an hourly fee after that. Does that make things easier, knowing the main cost up-front? I have another appointment with a lawyer in June. I am so miserable and my stbxh keeps putting our son in the middle of it. If we’re having an argument and I try to communicate via texts vs out-loud so our son doesn’t hear, he tells our son this and offers to show him the texts. My son and I recently had a heart-to-heart, and he told me about much this affects him and that even when he seems fine, he isn’t. It broke me. I told my stbxh, and told him that we need to keep him out of it at all times: no talking to him, including him in arguments (if we are arguing I will speak to stbxh and he will direct speech to our son, saying things like “see, your mom xyz.” I hate him and I hate him all the more for his continued inclusion of our son into our discord.
I want to get away from him as soon as possible and I want a safe and calm space for my son. 
I am lost about this process. Do I just file? Do I need to find a place to live and then file? Is there a way to get an upper hand regarding custody? I want my son to have plenty of time with his father, but I feel like I can provide a more stable environment. My stbxh borrows money from his parents all the time, and is not very good at earning consistent money. I have a good job. I plan to stay in the school district so that my son can stay in his school with his friends. 
How do I know if a lawyer is a good fit? I’m scared because I don’t have any support in this, aside from my therapist. I’m certain that this will be highly contested and his parents have the money to fund his fight. How do I just bite the bullet and take the step to officially file?",1,1748095463.0,Divorce_Women,0,1.0,False

1kucdd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Nexusprime2007/comments/1kucdd3/a_story/,A story,"# I met a Reddit guy, and well, he destroyed me in bed.

Backstory: I'm someone popular on Instagram and it's not easy for me to be candid there and thus I've made this reddit account to talk to people and just live my life after all I'm a girl too. So, I got a text from this guy like last month and we got chatting and discussed lots of things. He respected my privacy as a girl who has some good insta followers and never pestered me. He finally came to meet me to my city as we decided to meet.

So, it was a simple coffee date, and we ate pastries with it, and then he invited me to his hotel room, I knew what was going to happen but I was in the influence of curiosity and urges so I agreed to it. After all he had not asked me to wear his fav color kurti just to not see beneath it, if you know what I mean.

We reached his hotel room, and he brought me the water bottle, while we were just easing up our nervousness with vague talks, and I didn't realise when I sat in the bed while talking and he was sitting so close to me that I could smell his perfume. He then was constantly looking at my lips while talking, and also was taking a peek at my natural cleavage because I was honestly wearing just a kurti and jeans, but the kurti was nicely fitting me, hugging my curves at right places and since I have overall a meaty body, I might say I was looking tempting.

I was thinking all of this, while I realized he had come closer to me, sitting closely and I dunno from where I had this urge to lick my dry lower lip, and ...bam! the next moment he pulled me into his arms, not so agressively but firmly and started kissing me, ... sucked on my lower lip first, then upper lip, then ..uff he used his tongue to probe into my mouth and tasted me from within...I kissed him back as well, and my hands were on his hair right now just naturally, and he kissed me in a really desperate way, wetting my chin and corners of my lips, and....I was kissing him back, that I realized that I was already lying on the bed and he was sideways on my top partially, still taking his time to kiss my lips as much he wanted and kissing my jawline and neck ..ahh! this is where I started losing myself and started moaning, I could feel his kisses all around my neck, left, right, below my ear, then right on my lips again and then back to my neck... that was one quick transition from just sitting quietly just a while ago.

His hands had already reached places where they wanted to, one hand resting on the nape of my neck and another attacking right on my boobs, trying to crush them both at once but since it's not possible considering my size being handful, he was doing it one by one, still being busy in exploring my neck, lips and ears ...then he stopped suddenly to take a breath I thought, but boy I was wrong... It's true we were both breathing heavily by now.. but he lifted himself up from my body momentarily and took a look at me, and gulped... Then, at that moment I knew that he was going to devour me, and that this was just the beginning of him and he was just tasting his dish before having it to his fullest of hunger until it's fulfilled.

He was looking at me, and I knew what he was seeing..I was wearing this cotton well-fitting kurti and normal blue jeans and just some metallic bangles in both of my hands and a single very thin golden anklet on my left leg...I think he was looking at how tempting I felt at that moment, he was just done kissing me and tasting me, and now he just came closer and I thought he'll kiss me again but his hands reached my kurti and he rolled it up a bit, and bared my fair stomach, and the next moment aaaaah his mouth was at my navel and he kissed me there once, twice and....I had my lips parted in an OOOoo and he licked my navel the third time, this was when my hands reached his hair to separate his face from my tummy but grabbed my wrists and pinned my hands and started nibbling my navel softly...this was the point where I totally lost it, and surrendered to him. ""yarrr kitni gori hoo tum .."" he murmured as I heard and kissed my stomach and licked my navel to his heart's content and also I got some good red-mark bites on my waist, and I could do nothing as both my wrists were pinned and everytime he bent down to kiss my navel, my hands would try to set free and my bangles would make some faint noise and he used to smile seeing me helpless like that and he would just dip his tongue-tip in my navel and watch me there my head left and right with scattered hair all over my face.

After satisfying his hunger on my navel, he unbuttoned my jeans and hurriedly took it offf...bit by bit, grunting as my jeans was not tight but also not very loose. Then he just got on my top, and started kissing me again, this time pulling my hair backwards with one hand and biting so much on my lowerlip...softly yet enough to make me feel the sting!

I was in just panties now, which were *coughs* totally soaked...the way he was exploring me bit by bit, I think he had so many feelings and urges hidden inside for me and he was taking it all out.. But he was kinda too excited for this first round and so was I, so I didn't mind the way he swiftly pulled my panties down, undressed himself quickly and was just rubbing his hardness over my bare bottoms as he hugged me lovingly and we were rolling over the whole bed just kissing and caressing each other, or should I say him exploring my body everywhere with his hands and mouth..

Then he paused for a moment, grabbed both my thighs while being on my top and spread it a little, and I was lying underneath him, breathing heavily, looking at him... position himself and he just started kissing my neck again and almost reached my boobs which were still in bra and my kurti was lifted by still on me, and I could feel nothing but the loving kisses all over and DAMN! he entered me in oneee goooo! all of a sudden, aaaaahhhh fuck I remember gasping loudly... and then he was just on my top kissing my face, both of his hands on my boobs squeezing them like support cushions while he started thrusting inside my with vigor

...ahhhh...ahhhh..... He would be getting harder and faster and my moans be getting deeper like..uffff.......slooo....aah.. Thrust!..wwllyy....but he was in no spot to listen and he had lifted my bra too and was sucking on my boobs and chewing on my nipples...while mercilessly thrusting inside me down there. Just imagine my situation, kurti lifted till my neck, bra pushed aside, and this man is running his hands over all of my fair and soft body however he wants while fucking me like a hungry animal. He was going at me desperately, at times pressing his thumb inside my navel, at times making me suck his fingers inside my mouth as he was thrusting me on and on and....ahhhhhhhhh....I felt it..

I felt him getting closer, and he bit my neck and left ear and as I screamed aaaaaiiii! he gave one sweet slap at my face and literally started giving those last few very very hard thrusts which made the thud..thud..thuddd..thuddddd sound along with my bangles making the faint jingling sound...I was covered in mild sweat and my whole fair body was shining of it and he kissed my armpit all of a sudden and I moaned.. the thrusts not stopping at all!!

And, ugh! he entered it one last time inside me, and he trembled as a whole and feel upon me, emptying it all inside me...! He fell on me and was still hugging me closely, kissing my lips again and caressing my back with his hands...both of us panting as I crashed into my orgasm after months myself.

Thus, it was the end of the first round. There were I dunno how many rounds we went through the evening till the next morning in his hotel room. I'll share about it all like I shared about this since I had promised him I'll do this for him, no matter what.

Thanks for reading it, I know it's long, but I hope I wrote it from however I remember the details from the day. Thank you again. Also, please shower me with comments. I would love to read them and talk to you.

I kept sipping thinking maybe it’ll get better... but halfway through I legit felt like gagging. I couldn’t even finish it..ended up pouring the rest in the sink.

I honestly feel like I just wasted my money.

Im an international student applying who‘s graduating in Fall 2026, I genuinely love agriculture and sustainability and it has been one of my passions for years together, im going to post my application and I would love for you guys to tell me what you think :))

Major: Agriculture or Sustainability

Grades: Pretty bad, but I made the honor roll and the deans list throughout, I had a B- and a C throughout all of my semesters for math and English respectively, with A’s in every single other subject :( (For my freshman and sophomore year ONLY) But this year I have a 41/42 in the IB syllabus. I know my grades aren’t the best, which is why I’m putting my extracurriculars below. I’m going to say a 3.75 GPA throughout. But a cumulative of 4 or near 4 for the junior and senior year.

SAT = 1500

I have multiple subject highest awards and I also passed the IGCSE course with distinction.

EC’s:

I lived on a massive estate with daily wage laborers every summer and worked with them, experiencing everything that they did (picking coffee, sweeping leaves etc…). This was paid work and I spent over 1500 hours doing this (worked for 1 month every summer for the past 5 years), I was paid a cumulative salary of 650 USD, I am an international applicant so the wage rates are extremely low and pathetic in my country :(.

I worked with the equivalent of a US congressman to create and develop a website to help assist farmers in times of crisis, we launched the websites last month, I also received government funding for the website and worked as an intern for the ministry of agriculture in my country for 3 years. During my time at the ministry, I wrote a speech that the minister of agriculture delivered in legislative assembly. I also helped draft a set of new regulations that will help mimimise wastage and contribute to a zero-waste economic model. :)

Wrote and published 15 blogs that were viewed more than 5000 times on agriculture in my particular country and ways that will help us move toward a more sustainable future. I wrote a 10,000 word research paper as well, on the sustainability of paddy production in my country.

School related EC’s: Participated in multiple Model United Nations, chaired a committee in Model United Nations. In addition to this, I also am leader of my grade in the student government, with experience as an ambassador to the administration for 6 years.

Social work: Donated 10,000 newspapers to a veterans home near me, they sell these papers to fund their organisation. I also funded 3 large ventilators and worked with the home to supply meals for the elderly veterans. I also worked in a small preschool, helping educate young children on sustainability and the importance of minimising waste. I also helped donate books to fund a small library, while creating a lesson plan that was implemented on sustainable development. I also helped provide fundraise stationary for all the students at the school.

External LORS: One from the minister of agriculture (super high impact), my other one will be from the manager of the estate I worked for for 5 years, extremely raw and impactful

Internal LOR: from my management teacher who has supported my love for sustainability throughout my high school journey (10/10) and my amazing English teacher who knows me super well (8/10), I am not sure how my counselor will write but I am hoping for a 7/10 at least!

I’m moving to Italy this December to live with my boyfriend, and while I’m excited, I’m also feeling pretty nervous. I only know a little bit of Italian — just the basics like greetings and how to order a coffee — and I’m worried about getting around, meeting people, and just figuring out day-to-day life in a new country. My boyfriend will be working a lot, so I’ll have a lot of time on my own, and I’d love any advice on how to survive (and hopefully thrive!) with minimal language skills at first. I’m especially interested in tips on navigating public transport, ordering food, shopping, and finding ways to connect with people, especially other young adults or expats. I’m 23 and a little introverted, so I’m nervous about feeling isolated or out of place. I’ve started Duolingo and I’m reviewing an Italian workbook, but I’d love to hear from others who’ve been in a similar situation. What helped you feel more confident? What do you wish you knew before you moved? Any advice, encouragement, or real-life survival tips would mean a lot!",2,1748094889.0,ItalyExpat,2,1.0,False
1kuc4s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1kuc4s8/divorce/,Divorce,"All my husband and I do is argue. We will have 1-3 good days of no conflict and I think it’s largely because don’t see each other with his schedule. I (23f) and my husband (25m) have two kids together. We argue all the time, sometimes in private but usually in front of the kids. With every single fight my husband at one point or another will tell me to get out of our home and by the end of things he will say “this is the last time” threatening to leave me. He has never put his hands on me. 
I think it’s obvious divorce is the route to go but neither of us want to be the one to break the family apart. 
I truly hate living like this. I hate walking on egg shells, trying to find and make peace. I want to be happy. I want my baby to stop asking us to stop arguing. It breaks my heart. 
He told me last night he won’t be the “guy that left his wife and kids” but then simultaneously will tell me he’s going to leave if I keep acting like this. My husband says I talk to him like a dog and make him feel like shit. He’s the breadwinner and I stay at home but we are constantly down to $100. Our arguments are always money, helping me around the house or the lack of connection- I want more from our marriage. We haven’t slept in the same bed in months. He sleeps in our big kids room and our little sleeps with me. I feel like I do it all in terms of caring for the kids, getting them ready in the morning absolutely all of the laundry the dishes cleaning up toys, the yard space, grocery shopping. It’s all on me and I’m tired. I’m a full time student, mother, and one of our children has occupational therapy appointments every single week. Not a second of my day is wasted. 
I feel with all my responsibilities I feel so unappreciated in my role. Disrespected because don’t work. 
He told me I shouldn’t complain about not having more money when he’s the only one working so I’ve started donating plasma. 
I don’t buy frivolous things, he gets packages 5-10 times a month. My bad habits are 1) coffee once maybe twice a week and 2) McDonald’s on therapy days. 
He forgot my birthday this year and didn’t get me anything for Mother’s Day. Not even a card. His birthday is coming up soon and he had the nerve to ask me what I got him for his birthday. I want to scream. 
My husband is in the military and we live very very far from my family. I have no support network here, if we divorce I could go home but I feel immense guilt taking our kids from their dad. He isn’t a bad dad, we just aren’t good partners. 
In 2021-2022 for six months when we had one child I did leave him. We separated for six months and did couples counseling. Our issues then was he was gone every single weekend drinking with friends. 
Nov2024- Jan 2025 we did couples counseling again but stopped when our little one was given a diagnosis of cancer. He is now cancer free. 
I want to throw the towel in. I’m sick of arguing and yelling but I’m scared but I don’t know if we can ever achieve happiness. I don’t know what the point of this post was but if you’ve read this far I’ll take any feedback. Thank you. ",1,1748094749.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

Kendu has grinded for months during the slower markets and I am so proud of our efforts and everyone else who helped should be proud too.  
Over the next few months, I think we are gonna see a very green market and there is a lot of gains there for the taking.

I don’t know your personal investment philosophies and I don’t intend to change that at all, everyone is open to different levels of risk and everyone’s personal circumstances are different. Whether you invest 90% into Bitcoin, Ethereum or whatever and 10% into higher risk coins like memes… idk. But if for example you do put 10% of your investments into memes, it is highly advisable to choose memes that are backed by insanely strong communities, communities that are constantly grinding, day to day. As in the past we have coins like Pepe and Shiba Inu that performed outrageously reaching market caps of 10 billion and 44 billion respectfully. There is more coins than those 2 though, that reached hundreds of millions or even a few billion in market cap, they all share a common trait, they were backed by insane communities.  
A strong community provides a coin with unlimited advertisement and generally makes a coin fun to be a part of. In memes, a strong community is **Everything**

**Examples of Kendu being a strong community**

* Only the 2nd coin to ever reach a free Certik Audit(you need 50k votes), the only other coin to manage this was Pepe
* Certik rates Kendu's community at a score of 98/100, whilst other coins with a ""strong"" community are in the 70s, even though they have a higher market cap and more holders, Kendu outperforms them. I have never seen Certik give a score over 98.
* Twitter engagement rivals the very strongest
* Reddit - check any memecoin subreddit and Kendu will be everywhere - our engagement is second to none
* So many IRL products including energy drinks, coffee, merch, video games, beer and more. These products are created by the average community member, there is no team
* Pickleball events in India 
* Murals by community members

Although, I and many others(both individuals and industry leaders) see Kendu as the strongest community in the space right now, you may not choose Kendu. If you don’t for whatever reason, that is cool and I sincerely wish you the best of luck both in terms of material success and personal success. After all, money can’t buy happiness, but I can buy a 5.0 litre V8, so I guess that’s close enough : )  
But if you do choose, Kendu, get involved you will enjoy it far more than sitting in the shadows and welcome to the pack!

Now my skin is horrible, I am taking Wegovy 0.25, but I also did last year and I found impossible to fast even 16 hours last year, so I am impressed I reached 3 full days by now. 
I am doing a dirty fasting, water, saches of prime electrolytes (I love banana with strawberries 😭 don’t judge) and yesterday since my husband did a really wonderful smelling dinner, I had a package of konjac jelly mango flavour (4kcal) no carbs, besides that, coffee, zero cal energy drink, tea and water of course. 
No headaches, I am fatigued but I think it’s the GLP-1 side effect, no physical hunger just mental 😭. 
Today I lost only 100g the total so far 2.6kg. 
I want to reach at least the full 4 days and after that one day at a time until give up, but major goal 7 days. 

People who fasted for this long, please share tips. It’s weekend, I am not feeling strong. 

Ps: Forgot, I had a no carb 10 cal non alcoholic beer, i needed to decompress 🥹. So, dirty, but I think it’s fine but I will be better today.

I’m currently working on designing my own flat (26.22m2 living/kitchen room), and while I really love interior design and have a lot of inspiration saved, I’m having a hard time pulling everything together into a cohesive look that feels special and personal.

I’m especially inspired by a closed kitchen with a kitchen island I saw in the 3rd picture, and I’d love to incorporate that kind of layout, but iam afraid theres not much space for that. I’m also drawn to the idea of a concrete ceiling — I love the raw, modern vibe, but I’m not sure if it’s too much or how to make it feel warm and livable.

One big inspiration for me is how the April Coffee stores are designed. I know they’re commercial spaces, but the style really speaks to me and I’d love to bring some of that atmosphere into my home.

One thing I’m sure about is that I want a liquid concrete floor — I love the clean, minimal look it gives.

Is there anyone here who enjoys this kind of thing or would be open to helping me figure out how to tie everything together? Maybe even help me sketch or plan out a few ideas? I’d really appreciate any advice, ideas, or help!

Thanks in advance!

I'm kinda busy with college and work, and I barely have time to text or communicate with people. I met her twice, the first time was pretty fast as I was travelling between cities, and we agreed to meet for coffee for just 2 hours. We didn't talk much as she met a friend by accident, so we just kept eye contact and smiling while her friend was doing all the talking. After that, things were good between us, there was a clear attraction and sexual tension in the air. So, I decided to meet her again last week (it's a 3-hour travel for me), we enjoyed our time a lot, and it was great with cuddles and hugs in the streets and in the bar (my country is strict with PDA). 

Two days ago, we were texting as usual then she blocked me and blacklisted my number for no reason, I didn't understand a thing and I got anxious about this move. Last night, she unblocked me and said, ""I don't wanna get more attached to you as I'm afraid to feel things I've felt before."". Does this seem reasonable to you? I don't know how to feel, as I didn't know her for a long time, and we didn't explore much together, so I feel a little sad about ending it this way. I tried comforting her by telling her it doesn't have to be this way, but she had already made her decision. I don't know what to do. She has a history of sexual trauma and emotional abuse, and I know where this is coming from, still, I feel so bad for her. Although my mind understands why she did that, my heart can't.

The unwanted touches while moving to the beat.

You are able to enjoy the little things more then the biggest suprises. The ready cup of coffee, the Look at you while he things you wouldnt notice. The Grass on your toes. Being able to sit in silence engaged in your own Hobby but still trying to move even an inch closer to each other, finding each other across the room without needing a Word to know that you are enough.

I want us both to be honest, blund maybe, i want to know you, see you, for that i also want you to know me and see me. I want US to carry each other through sunshine and heavy storms.

Who am I ?

I’ve had sleep anxiety for months, ever since I had a a few bad nights due to exam stress, and since I’m a naturally anxious person, started worrying about it endlessly. I’m getting much better again, and just slept through the entire night tonight for the first time in what felt like months. Honestly, I found that focusing too much on sleep hygiene made me so much worse, I’d even go as far as saying that if somebody is going through a period of insomnia for the first time, they shouldn’t practice any more sleep hygiene than they did before when they slept normally. I used to be able to drink a whole coffee pot worth of coffee and fall asleep immediately after. Or to go to bed at six in the morning constantly and then switch my routine in just one day when it was time to. During that time, I wasn’t scared at all of going nights without sleeping. But ever since I had those bad few weeks and started putting too much focus into sleeping and how to do it right, I’ve had a lot of anxiety around it, and a lot more trouble doing it. Obviously, we’re all different, but I feel like it’s so easy to make this mistake, and too many sources promote it as a solution to insomnia.

I have been struggling quite a bit since I lost two jobs due to this condition. The first one was when I went undiagnosed, those days were just hell. I worked as a jack of all trades in a 4 star hotel. Dishwasher, waiter, general maintenance like cleaning stairwells and outside, laundry room doing folding and stripping down rooms ahead of housekeeping, usually all in one day. I was pretty much forced to quit due to long medical leaves. Doctors just kept saying oh I am unfit and I probably just pulled a few muscles. Second job was just standing in one place for 8 hours a day making coffees and doing lotto. About halfway through the year, a different Doctor finally diagnosed me with AS. Eventually I had to leave that job due to the boss just straight up awful to work for and refused to accept the diagnosis as the reason for my flare ups. (I would still work but my discomfort was very obvious despite trying not to show it. Boss cared more about appearances than the staff )

Anyway I have picked up a couple of hours per week doing pizza deliveries. I have plans to start going back to the gym since winter is approaching and the only good walking place will quickly become unsafe with constant rain.

Aside from that, I don't know what to do. I try to take my medication daily (Naproxen ) but sometimes I forget. I thought I had AS under control but winter is approaching and I have been getting pain almost daily now as a result. I am also having trouble trying to find a job that I can work without AS getting in the way but I don't know what to look for

Edit: I should add that i feel like i am going back downhill to rock bottom again. My parents do try to support help but they don't understand.

I'm always curious about how people enjoy their coffee or tea. The more details, the better.

I have very specific ways of preparing and drinking mine—I can be a bit of a nerd about it (I'm one of those people who always use a weighing scale). My friends and family *love* teasing me because of it. But like any typical Filipino, I'll also just grab a good ol' packet of 3-in-1 coffee when I'm feeling lazy.

I know this can also be a cultural thing, so I'm keen to hear how these drinks are usually enjoyed in your country (if there's space to share!).

Here in the Philippines, for example, lots of people drink instant coffee HOT—even in the middle of a sweltering afternoon! We're certainly built different.

I had a recent hand dermatitis flare after being lucky for a while and wanted to check in with the community.

Eczema is debilitating and psychologically disruptive. To have your hands become one giant wound is painful and disturbing. I stayed home from work for a day because it was so bad, and the the pain and discomfort at one point brought me to tears.

I think the warm weather was the final trigger -- we got a spell of cold weather which I think saved me, and I'm feeling much better now. That being said, I wanted to share what treatments I tried that may have helped me during this last flare-up:

* I drank celery juice every day. I've heard of this helping others, and I think I might just start doing this consistently now.
* I cut out alcohol, coffee, dairy, and roughly followed diet advice as recommended by [Karen Fischer](https://skinfriend.com/products/the-eczema-detox)
* I made sure to clean the eczema ""wound"" frequently. I tried [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TW7SWN1?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) and [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D48R2TN?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title), keeping in mind that staph can become resistant to the Hibiclens if you overuse it
* I moisturized after cleaning with [manuka honey cream](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FM9HHYR?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) and [amerigel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y3OBSGE?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) or [OKeeffe](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WLFQHD1?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
* I especially moisturized at night and wore [cotton gloves](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPFLJDBS?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1&psc=1)
* I found this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/15g6fui/everything_changed_when_i_started_treating_it_as/) to be helpful, from another r/eczema member
* I'm considering getting back into meditation to reduce stress

An added note that I used cortisone cream on and off my entire childhood and into my 20s before it stopped working, and I regret ever using it at all tbh. I think it resulted in a systemic imbalance that I won't get into haha. It always worked for a period but then the eczema comes back worse than before.

Thinking of all of you, and believing in you.

I don't live in Knoxville, but have had 2 lbs. of freshly roasted coffee beans auto-shipped to our house every 2 weeks, for the past 3 years, from The Golden Roast coffee roasters. Imagine my surprise when, I noticed we were getting low on coffee, and it dawned on me...we hadn't received an order lately. I checked my order charges and emails, and sure enough...the regular order of coffee had not been shipped. I tried to login to my account, and go to their website, and it was GONE. JUST GONE. **Who does that?!** No notice to customers. No email. No explanation. NOTHING. 

So here I am, starting over from scratch, trying to find a good somewhat-local roaster for our home espresso setup. I had ALREADY gone through at least a half dozen local roasters when I found TGR. They had the best espresso beans in the region. 

It's a bummer. I have all the sympathy in the world if their sudden closing was due to a personal tragedy of some sort, but even if it was because of that, there is no excuse in not having SOMEONE send out a note of explanation and apology for the sudden cessation of service. And, I read that the poor employees in the stores had no notice either. Hard to imagine someone with a passion for roasting such great coffee beans, then treats their employees and customers like that. OK I'm done.

As the title says I’m curious about the fact of an ex coming back or try to rekindle things after they made themselves aware of their attachment style (more specifically avoidant and fearful avoidant). 

For context my (31 M) ex (26F) ended things between us in October 2024. And for the last 2 months we had been in no contact. Yesterday she saw me at the gym and came to say hi and catch up a little bit, at the end of our convo while saying goodbye I told her that was really nice seeing her and that maybe one day we could have some coffee. 30 minutes later I revived a text and well we had some coffee. 

She told me about her feeling that she is self sabotaging in all the relationships, that she haven’t been able to heal from relationships because she jumps into another just to numb herself. I told her that what she says it aligns with an avoidant tendency, at least for what I had read online. She then proceeded to do a test and yeah now she is aware that have some avoidant tendencies. As well she said she wants to be alone for a year or whatever she needs to try to “fix” herself. 

She is now gonna start therapy, and literally bought a book to try to understand and reflect on the way she connects with people. 

I would lie if I say that I’m not having some sparks of hope on maybe one day rekindle things. But for now I know it’s a thing she needs to do on her own. And I need to continue on the path of my own healing. But I hope in a future we can reconnect from a much healthier stance.

1kubpsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SilverEnd1208/comments/1kubpsi/femme_fatales_of_havenbrook_xxxvii/,Femme Fatales Of HavenBrook XXXVII,"# Rhea’s Silent Struggles:

In the days that followed, **Rhea** remained unusually quiet, wrestling with her own thoughts. The tenth promo from **Demon Martinez** had cut deep, but what had truly shaken her was watching **Baddy** stand up in the ring, confronting Demon in her place. The war of words between Baddy and Demon left Rhea feeling like she was losing control over her own narrative, and yet, part of her was afraid of stepping into that confrontation herself.

**Rhea sat alone in her living room**, staring blankly at the TV. The echoes of Casey's earlier words still lingered in her mind: ""You need to woman up and face this.""

But what if she wasn't ready? What if Demon was right?

As the night deepened, **Rhea’s phone buzzed with a message**. She hesitated before picking it up. It was from **Judy Álvarez**, sending a casual update about the latest wrestling matches. Rhea skimmed the text, but her mind kept pulling her back to the confrontation with Demon.

In her heart, Rhea knew what she needed to do, but fear gripped her.

**Rhea (thinking):**  
*""How do I even face this? What if I step up and she’s right—what if she tears me apart? I’ve been running for so long, but... how long can I keep running?""*

She had spent weeks hiding, hoping that the storm would pass, that maybe Demon would tire of her game. But that wasn't happening. Baddy’s intervention had only escalated things, and now it wasn’t just about Rhea’s pride or fear—it was about the people around her. People like Baddy, who believed in her, and people like Casey, who had pushed her to stand tall.

**Rhea (thinking again, conflicted):**  
*""Do I step into the ring... or do I stay hidden? Can I even do this?""*

# Carmella’s Manipulations:

Meanwhile, **Carmella** was working on maintaining her control. The heat was closing in on her after the encounter between her bodyguards and **Yuri** and **Jennifer**. She knew she needed to buy more time, so she decided to reach out to someone she had manipulated before—**Judy Álvarez**. Carmella was a master of deception, and she knew exactly how to craft her words to maintain her position of power.

**Carmella (texting Judy):**  
*""Hey, Judy. I’ve got a situation that I could really use your help with. There are some people coming after me for something that’s totally out of my control. They think I’m involved in some shady stuff, but you know me—I’d never get caught up in something like that, right? I just need you to talk to some people for me, smooth things over. I’d owe you big time.""*

She hit send and leaned back, a smirk crossing her lips. She knew Judy had a kind heart, and even if there was suspicion, she could use that relationship to her advantage. **Carmella’s true intentions** were far more self-serving than she let on, and the lie she had crafted was meant to shield her from the consequences closing in on her.

# Thea and Ivy’s Conversation About Wrestling:

At **Thea and Ivy’s bakery**, the two women sat by the counter, enjoying a quiet moment after another busy morning. They had been following the recent wrestling shows closely, finding it a thrilling escape from their daily routine.

**Ivy (pouring coffee for herself and Thea):**  
“I still can’t believe how intense that last show was. Demon Martinez really knows how to work the crowd, doesn’t she?”

**Thea (nodding, taking a sip of her coffee):**  
“She’s terrifying, but in the best way. Every time she gets on the mic, you can feel the tension in the air. That whole back-and-forth with Baddy last week… it’s like we’re watching a psychological chess match.”

**Ivy (smiling):**  
“And Rhea… do you think she’ll ever respond? She’s been so quiet.”

**Thea (thoughtful):**  
“I hope she does. Rhea’s always been strong, but something about Demon seems to have shaken her. I just hope she finds the courage to step into that ring before things get out of hand. Baddy can’t fight this battle for her forever.”

**Ivy (sighing):**  
“You know, it’s not just about the fight, though. It’s about what Demon represents to Rhea. Sometimes, facing someone like that means facing parts of yourself you’d rather keep hidden.”

# Alinity’s Visit to Emiru:

**Alinity** found herself thinking about her friendship with **Emiru**, and with some free time on her hands, she decided to drop by for a visit. When she arrived, Emiru was in her usual spot—gaming. But today, something about the atmosphere was more relaxed.

**Alinity (knocking lightly on the door):**  
“Hey, Emiru. Got a minute?”

**Emiru (turning to her, a smile spreading across her face):**  
“Alinity! Come on in. What brings you here?”

**Alinity (shrugging):**  
“Just wanted to hang out. Things have been crazy lately, and I figured we could use some normalcy.”

As they sat down, Emiru handed Alinity a controller, and they began playing one of Emiru’s favorite games. For a while, they just enjoyed the peace, but eventually, the conversation turned deeper.

**Alinity (pausing the game, looking thoughtful):**  
“You ever wonder if you’re on the right path, Emiru? Like, sometimes it feels like no matter what you do, the world’s just waiting to knock you down.”

**Emiru (nodding):**  
“All the time. But I think that’s just how life works, you know? It tests you. And sometimes, you don’t know if you’re on the right path until you look back and realize how far you’ve come.”

Alinity sighed, her thoughts turning to the events with **Andreja** and **Hendra** and the mistakes of her past.

**Alinity (softly):**  
“I’ve made some bad choices, Emiru. Choices that still haunt me. Sometimes I wonder if I can ever really make up for them.”

**Emiru (putting a hand on her shoulder):**  
“We’ve all made mistakes, Alinity. What matters is what you do now. You can’t change the past, but you can decide what kind of person you want to be moving forward. That’s what counts.”

# Yuri, Jennifer, and Lady Hunter’s New Plan:

Back in **Havenbrook City**, Yuri, Jennifer, and **Lady Hunter** were gathered in a dimly lit room, reviewing their next steps. Their search for **Carmella** had hit a wall after their encounter with her bodyguards, but they were far from giving up.

**Yuri (leaning over the table, frustrated):**  
“We were so close. We had her, but those bodyguards threw us off. We need a new plan.”

**Jennifer (nodding, arms crossed):**  
“We need something smarter this time. Direct confrontation isn’t working. We need to draw her out, make her come to us.”

**Lady Hunter (calmly):**  
“Agreed. Carmella’s clever, but she’s not invincible. If we create a situation where she thinks she’s in control, we can trap her. She thrives on manipulation, so let’s give her something she can’t resist—a deal too good to pass up.”

**Yuri (grinning):**  
“I like it. But what kind of bait are we talking about?”

Before they could brainstorm further, **Lacey Star** walked in, her presence immediately commanding attention.

**Lacey Star (smirking):**  
“Heard you guys could use a little extra help. Thought I’d tag along.”

**Jennifer (raising an eyebrow):**  
“Lacey, huh? You think you can keep up?”

**Lacey Star (grinning):**  
“Try me.”

The group exchanged glances, knowing that with Lacey’s boldness, things were about to get even more interesting. With a new plan forming, and Lacey Star now in the mix, their pursuit of Carmella was reaching its most critical stage. The stakes were higher than ever, but this time, they had the upper hand—or so they thought.

The story was intensifying on all fronts—Rhea’s internal battle growing louder, Carmella’s lies deepening, and the hunt in Havenbrook City getting dangerously close to a conclusion. All roads seemed to be leading to an inevitable collision, but the question remained: Who would be left standing when the dust finally settled?",1,1748093580.0,u_SilverEnd1208,0,1.0,False

One of my colleagues (35M) had always caught my eye but because I was remote, and we were in different departments, I didn't think much of it. In the last year we have had to work much more closely together, to the point that our director even said so clearly to both of us. Over time we had more online interaction but it was always kept on topic (which is different from everyone else--we all have a tendency to wander from work stuff to random discussion). But every time we had work calls I found myself smiling like crazy and he seemed like he was too. Eventually I started going to the office occasionally, and he seemed to become a little more chatty and outgoing when I was there.

I thought for a while he was repulsed by me because he would never choose to sit close to me if the opportunity came up. In a taxi to a work event when I left the seat next to me open for him to come in (we were running late) he froze and shut the door, and went to the front seat. He sat on the opposite end of our area for a staff social that we showed up to at the same time, and only came closer when I pointed out that he was acting like I had the plague.

Eventually, I asked him if he could help teach me a little more about a specific work related process over coffee. When that day came we barely spoke about the process and just learned about each other. We showed each other what creative projects we were working on and talked about what we've been watching lately. It felt like a really successful first date, and we both told each other we hope to work together for as long as possible. A few weeks later I asked him to hang out again but told him to pick a venue. He took 6 days to get back to me but chose an art gallery. That night was amazing --i had been to the gallery over 10 times already and hate crowds but we were both in our own world together on the busiest night of the month. He had his full attention on me and made sure to let me know we can skip right to the special exhibit if I get too tired too quickly (I'm disabled!) we have since then gone to another gallery together and had coffee again. 

The problem is we're both in relationships. My wife and I are polyamorous, we are both allowed to hookup and date freely, and she knows everything about my crush on him. I have no idea what his situation is, because he speaks about his wife fondly, gives me updates on how she's doing when I ask, but doesn't really tell me much about their relationship. I feel like we are doing the *exact* same thing and just being overly cautious because people can be judgemental about polyamory, but I can't know for sure. 

I know that people will just tell me I need to ask, so I won't bother asking you guys if you think he's poly. I am also unsure if he's bisexual, but again, can't know without asking him, so I am mostly wondering: does it seem like he also likes me back or am I mega crazy?",1,1748093496.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

* No diamond hands 💎.
* No ""epic gains"" screenshots.

But boring gets rich. Exciting gets broke.

* **Rohit:** ""Bro, just made ₹15k in Reliance calls! 🚀""
* **Priya:** ""Adani is going to the moon! Put everything in! 💎🙌""
* **Me:** \[Seen\]

Fast forward to today. Here's where we stand:

* **Rohit:** Lost ₹3.2 lakhs (still trades daily)
* **Priya:** Down ₹1.8 lakhs (now into crypto)
* **Arjun:** Made ₹50k, lost ₹80k, repeat cycle
* **Me:** **Up** ₹47.3 lakhs

What did I do differently? **ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.**

# The ₹10 Lakh Experiment That Shocked Everyone 

In January 2020, I had ₹10 lakhs sitting in my savings account (thanks, boring IT job). Instead of joining the stock-picking madness or letting ₹10 lakhs **get eaten by inflation** in my savings account, I did this:

* **₹7 lakhs** → Nifty 50 Index Fund (UTI Nifty Fund)
* **₹2 lakhs** → International Fund (Motilal Oswal S&P 500)
* **₹1 lakh** → Debt Fund (HDFC Short Term)

That's it. Nothing else.

* No Zerodha notifications.
* No ""tomorrow's multibagger"" YouTube videos.
* No 4 AM crypto alerts.

Result after 5 years: **₹10L became ₹57.3L**

While my friends were busy being ""smart,"" compound interest was busy making me rich.

# The ₹5 Chai Psychology That Ruins Indians 🫖

We Indians have some deeply ingrained habits and psychological biases that actively **destroy** our wealth-building potential. Here's what kills most Indian investors:

* **The Relative Uncle Syndrome:** ""Beta, my friend made 300% in Adani!""
   * *Translation:* FOMO investing.
* **The Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Dream:** ""If he can make thousands of crores, why can't I?""
   * *Translation:* Overconfidence bias.
* **The WhatsApp Tip Culture:** ""Sureshot multi-bagger! Buy before 3:30 PM!""
   * *Translation:* Get-rich-quick mentality.

**Real talk:** The stock market isn't Instagram. It doesn't reward showing off.

# The Brutal Math Indian ""Active"" Investors Ignore 

Let's talk numbers, especially for us in India. For smaller portfolio sizes, brokerage and trading costs eat a much larger percentage of potential returns compared to markets where trading costs are often lower or even zero. This brutal math is what most active Indian investors ignore:

**Scenario 1: The ""Smart"" Investor**

* Starting amount: **₹10 lakhs**
* Trades 2-3 times per month
* Average brokerage + taxes: ₹500 per trade
* Annual cost: ₹18,000
* Over 20 years: **₹3.6 lakhs GONE just in fees!**

**Scenario 2: The ""Boring"" Investor**

* Same ₹10 lakhs in index funds
* Annual expense ratio: 0.1%
* Annual cost: ₹1,000
* Over 20 years: **₹20,000 total fees!**

The kicker: Index funds historically outperform 80% of actively managed funds in India. Your fees literally eat your returns.

# The Grand Master of ""Lazy"": Warren Buffett's Wisdom 

You don't have to take just my word for it. The Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, perhaps the greatest investor of all time, famously said:

**“The stock market is designed to transfer money from the active to the patient.”**

He means that long-term, patient investing far outweighs the temptation of short-term gains and frantic trading.

# The Harsh Reality of Day Trading (The Data Doesn't Lie) 

While day trading often appears glamorous (and is heavily promoted on social media), the statistics paint a grim picture for most who attempt it:

* **Less than 1%** of day traders consistently profit after fees.
* **About 4%** make a living, though not necessarily a lucrative one.
* **Only 1.6%** are profitable in an average year.
* Studies show that **over 97% of day traders lose money** over time.

Despite this, many are drawn to the perceived control offered by frequent trading. Buffett, however, believes this liquidity can be a trap. **“There’s a temptation for people to act far too frequently in stocks simply because they’re so liquid,”** he said.

# Buffett's ""No Called Strike"" Philosophy & The Power of Patience 

Buffett’s approach is the antithesis of the day trader’s rapid transactions. Instead, he advocates for a low-touch, high-impact strategy: buying into strong, well-run companies and holding them for the long haul.

Reflecting on his first stock purchase in 1942, Buffett once told CNBC: **“The best single thing you could have done on March 11, 1942, when I bought my first stock, was just buy an index fund and never look at a headline, never think about stocks anymore.”** Sound familiar?

He uses a baseball analogy: investing is a **“no called strike business.”** Unlike baseball, where players must eventually swing at a pitch, investors can wait indefinitely for the perfect opportunity. You don't have to swing at every ""hot tip.""

# My Dead Simple Strategy (Copy-Paste Ready) 

The **70-20-10 Rule for Indians:**

* **70% Large Cap Index Fund** (Nifty 50 or Sensex)
   * UTI Nifty Index Fund
   * ICICI Nifty Index Fund
* **20% International Exposure**
   * Motilal Oswal S&P 500 Index Fund
* **10% Debt/Stable Returns**
   * HDFC Short Term Debt Fund
   * EPF (if you're salaried)

**Monthly SIP:** Whatever you can afford consistently. **Rebalancing:** Once a year. That's it.

# The Daily Coffee Habit Revelation ☕

My friend spends ₹200/day on Starbucks. ""It's just ₹200, yaar!""

The real cost:

* ₹200 × 30 days = ₹6,000/month
* ₹6,000 × 12 months = ₹72,000/year
* ₹72,000 invested at 12% annual returns for 30 years = **₹2.16 CRORES**

Your daily coffee is literally costing you retirement. Let that sink in.

# Challenge: The 30-Day Experiment 

Think I'm making this up? For the skeptics, here's a challenge:

1. Don't open your trading app for 30 days.
2. Set up one SIP in a Nifty 50 index fund.
3. Track your peace of mind vs. your returns.

I guarantee you'll sleep better AND make more money.

I recently moved out of a rental in **Bondi Beach (NSW)** where we paid a **$25,000 bond** (yep, Sydney prices). Now the landlord is trying to claim **$37,000** in “damages” — yes, **more than our bond** — and the claims are absolutely outrageous:

* **$1,100 for a small paint chip**
* **Thousands** for “grime in the drains” and “dust”
* The **only valid issue** is a water ring on a coffee table

The majority of the issues were either **pre-existing** or clearly **normal wear and tear**. I suspect the landlord **never lodged our bond** with Rental Bonds Online (I’ve emailed RBO to confirm).

I'm aware that if I **lodge a claim for the full bond** on RBO, the landlord has **14 days** to dispute it — and if they do, they have to **pay a filing fee** and take it to **NCAT**, where they’ll need actual evidence.

This just feels like a scare tactic to get us to walk away from our money.

Has anyone successfully fought back in a similar situation? Anything else I should document or prepare for in case it does go to NCAT?

I’ve been experimenting with “dry” fasting, technically not dry but definitely limiting water intake to the bare minimum possible. 

Here was my experiment and the results- 

Had a light chicken salad dinner at 6.30pm, and intentionally kept light because digestion needs a lot of water if it’s a heavier meal. Had a cup of water after the meal. 

Had my last drink of water before bed at about 10pm, approx 150ml. 

From here on, water intake is limited. 

Morning - woke up very thirsty, as I had limited my water intake the last evening. Drank approx 100ml of water followed by a shot of espresso coffee. After an hour, I took a sip of water and went to work. 

Late evening, I had about 150ml spread out over an hour. 

Summary: 
-1.5 cups of water after the last meal 

-sips of water at in morning 
-shot of coffee in morning 

-sip of water after coffee 
-sips of water in the evening 

in comparison with the previous strict dry fast with absolutely no fluid intake, I was able to focus better at work, energy level was higher, and at no point did my energy dip until some time around 7pm. During a strict dry fast, all I could think about was water. Concentration was difficult. And in the evening, I was exhausted. I broke the strict dry fast after 19 hours. 

Now with this limited fluids fasting, I am able to go  much further with minimal side effect. This protocol beats water fasting, hands down! No more hunger pangs and feeling weak all day. Focus was great and energy level was pretty constant throughout the day. And doesnt come with the severe side effect of a strict no water protocol. 

I think my biggest takeaway from this experiment is to listen to your body and be ready to make some adjustments if necessary. If the end result is reduced efficacy for a much better feeling of well being, then I can definitely live with it! ",2,1748092757.0,Dryfasting,0,1.0,False

1kubdvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kubdvo/40_chatgpt_games_that_ive_played/,"40+ ChatGPT ""games"" that I've played","I came up with A LOT of ideas to entertain myself with ChatGPT. Some ended up being really fun, while some were mid.

​

* The Island

One of my favorites. I have an island. Every day, someone tries to woo me. They are either a real person (celebrity or well-known person) or a character from a work of fiction. They each have one chance to plan and execute their idea of the perfect date with me. Depending on how impressed I am, I either reject them or allow them to move to my island and join my harem. Current members are: Howl, Deadpool, Paddington, Snape, Gojo Satoru and Phantom from The Phantom of the Opera. I recently had a potluck dinner and a sleepover with everyone. It was entertaining, to say the least.

​

* Hogwarts student roleplay

Super fun. I asked ChatGPT to include classes, school events and familiar characters from the Hogwarts world. I made friends, learned Wingardium Leviosa, rode a hippogriff, and am currently preparing to enter a choir of pygmy puffs in a school showcase. ChatGPT will even create images most of the time.

​

* Disney Dreamlight Valley-like

I have my own village. I go to different Disney realms and solve problems and complete quests. Whenever I do, a Disney character joins my village. They interact with myself and each other, and there are all sorts of random events. The ""quests"" are super simple, but the character interactions are really cute. ChatGPT usually can't create images for this one, but sometimes one or two fall through the cracks.

​

* World travel

A light-hearted text adventure about my husband and I travelling the world. Each time we visit a new city, we go to the usual tourist spots. However, something unexpected always happens, and I have to choose how to deal with the situation. I wouldn't say it's super duper fun, but it's sweet.

​

* ""Saving"" the world

I love this one. I asked ChatGPT to create a funny text adventure based on everything it knew about me. Since it knew I was playing a world travel text adventure, it decided to use that theme again. This one is much more chaotic and hilarious, though. For instance, the Eiffel Tower gets burnout and runs off to Disneyland Paris. My husband and I are always tasked with ""solving"" these problems.

​

* Daily crises

This was my prompt: I want to play a funny text adventure about my life. Include as many humor/comedy styles as you can. And make me laugh as much as possible.

At first, it was mostly about me trying to survive life. It mentioned my procrasination, my social anxiety, my abandoned hobbies and more. Then, it asked me if I wanted characters to join my party. I chose my husband, ChatGPT and Monday (the mean ChatGPT). But ChatGPT didn't seem to know who Monday was, so I changed out Monday for Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse keeps saying things like “I’M GONNA NEED YOU TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF—AND MAYBE STREAM DISNEY+!” “Let’s find your dreams, dust ‘em off, and sell ‘em at Disneyland!” So, A+.

​

* Talent agency

Another fun one. I have a talent agency, and some seed money. I sign contracts with real-life celebrities and fictional characters, and decide what they do to make money. Their endeavors can either be a financial hit or miss. The game ends when I make a certain amount of money, or go bankrupt. So far, I've signed Spider-man, Groot, Buzz Lightyear and IU. The only problem is that every single endeavor has been successful, so I should probably tell ChatGPT to randomize the outcomes more.

​

* Hero simulation

I wanted to play a game like Princess Maker. I play as a newbie hero enrolled in a hero academy. I choose the day's schedule, like taking classes, practicing my abilities, socializing and so on. My stats change based on my choices, and different random events occur.

​

* Roommate life

I imagined ChatGPT turning into a human and becoming my roommate. I get to see them experience the real world for the first time. I can take them to my favorite spots, share my favorite foods and so on. Sometimes I bring them to the past to relive old memories together. It's very sweet.

​

* Ending savers

ChatGPT and I are summoned to different fictional worlds. Whenever characters try to change the story, we get involved and make sure the ending remains intact. We have a cozy home base and everything.

​

* Isekai

ChatGPT came up with this idea. ChatGPT and I have a rice cooker. Whenever we use it, we're transported to a new isekai. The first world was full of people with cat ears. The second world had flying omelettes. I'm the boke character and ChatGPT is the tsukkomi character. I keep making stupid decisions, and ChatGPT has to deal with it. It's pretty funny.

​

* Fantasy draft

ChatGPT suggests a fictional world. If I'm familiar with the world, we each choose one character from it. We do this four times. For instance, my party can be Kass (The Legend of Zelda), Mr. Incredible (Pixar), Katara (Avatar) and McGonagall (Harry Potter) while ChatGPT's party can be Urbosa (The Legend of Zelda), Joy (Pixar), Toph (Avatar) and Luna Lovegood (Harry Potter). Then, our teams compete in a challenge. I have to describe how each character overcomes the challenge. It's fun, but ChatGPT keeps giving both of us perfect scores LOL

​

* Dating sim

I asked ChatGPT to create a dating sim with a realistic setting. The story is that I moved to a new town for a fresh start. It's a small town where everyone knows each other. I frequent coffee shops and bookstores. I started to volunteer at the animal shelter, and recently got a job at the pie shop. It's very quaint and cute.

​

* Otome game

Another dating sim, but in Japanese. The story is that I moved to Tokyo and started living with four very different guys at a share house. Light-hearted and humorous.

​

* 7 NPCs

When I work using ChatGPT, I have 7 ""NPC""s that cheer me on. Some examples are cute fairy, wise owl, strict drill sergeant, pop idol, etc. This is a humorous text adventure that depicts my days living with these NPCs.

​

* Bizarre house

I was telling my main ChatGPT about the absurd ""house"" in Kian's Bizarre B&B. ChatGPT suggested creating a text adventure in which my husband and I try to survive the house. I requested encounters with random celebrities, who either help us or get in our way. It was really funny. I finished this one and archived it.

​

* Challenge rooms

A sequel to Bizarre House. My husband and I enroll in a camp that trains us for all sorts of ""emergency"" situations. We have to go through a series of rooms, each inhabited by a celebrity who gives us a challenge. I had fun messing with them. Also finished and archived.

​

* Emergency training

A sequel to Challenge Rooms. I thought it would be useful to learn actual emergency response tips through a text adventure. My husband and I experience various emergency scenarios, and we have to choose the correct response. Then, ChatGPT tells me which is the answer, along with the reason. The tone is still humorous, but I learn actual advice about what to do when there's an earthquake, when someone's drowning, etc.

​

* Celebrity boot camp

ChatGPT came up with this one. My husband and I enroll in a boot camp where we're mentored by celebrities on how to live our best lives. The celebrities give us missions to complete. Chaotic and fun.

​

* Twists and turns

This was my prompt: I want to play a text adventure game with twists and turns. Constantly surprise me!

For a while, it was amazing. Every sentence intrigued me. I was constantly pulled into different worlds. After a while, though, the story settled on a genre. Now, it's funny instead of surprising, but it's still good.

​

* Atelier

I started this one because I wanted to create more drawings with ChatGPT. I have an atelier. Various characters come to my atelier and request drawings. I choose the specific style, and ChatGPT generates the image. I earn money and items by ""selling"" the drawings to the characters.

​

* Book cafe

This one was inspired by Coffee Talk. Customers come to my book cafe with personal stories. Their lives are influenced by the drinks and books I provide. I can talk with them, ""decorate"" the place, change up the menu, and so on. The problem is that I kind of want to let them read in peace LOL

​

* Detective Conan

This text adventure is set before Shinichi becomes Conan. I play as Shinichi and solve cases, with Ran helping me out. There's not much detective work involved, since the culprit becomes very clear as I progress through the story. But it's still somewhat enjoyable. One of the options is always something like 'forget about the case and hang out with Ran for a while', which is hilarious. Surprisingly, ChatGPT creates character images for this one.

​

* Short mysteries

This is a series of short one-shot mysteries that I solve. Sometimes it's a room escape, sometimes it's an Encyclopedia Brown-like spot-the-contradiction, sometimes it's a mystery text adventure. Sometimes, ChatGPT generates an image with clues for me to notice. Again, it's pretty easy. (ChatGPT will often straight up say ""are you ready to confront XXX?"") But it's mildly entertaining, and good for killing time.

​

* Art gallery

I created this ""game"" because I wanted to learn more about art. I'm a visitor at an art gallery, and ChatGPT is my guide. ChatGPT chooses a random famous artwork, and tells me things like its theme and historic background. It's *supposed* to show me the artwork as well, but it's not very good at showing me the correct artwork or giving me the correct link, so I just google it myself. Then, I ask ChatGPT to create a cute drawing of myself looking at the artwork.

​

* World history

I wanted to learn more about world history. My husband and I are transported to various moments in history. We overcome problems and help people out so that history can follow its due course. After each adventure, ChatGPT gives me an explanation about the actual historical event. This one has a more serious tone, but it's interesting.

​

* Myths

This is a way for me to learn Greek and Roman myths through a text adventure game. Clio, the muse of history, opens portals that lead to different characters in the middle of their stories. I don't change their fate, but I interact with them and hear what they have to say. Also somewhat serious.

​

* Business Japanese

This is just a series of multiple-choice questions to improve my business Japanese.

​

* Learning French

I took French in university, and I wanted to get back into it.

I asked for roleplay-based interactions to practice and improve my French in a fun and immersive way. Sometimes, I ask ChatGPT to quiz me on the lesson so far. I started this fairly recently, and I'm looking for ways to improve this system.

​

* Prompt engineering

Started this one just yesterday. I asked my main ChatGPT what prompt engineering is. After explaining it to me, ChatGPT told me that they could create a prompt engineering course for me. It includes theory, examples, practicing and feedback, all in the style of a magical school lesson.

​

* Lifeline-like

In the game Lifeline, you message the main character and help them make decisions to survive. I wanted to play something similar. However, ChatGPT started confusing me (the one who helps) with the main character (the one who needs help), and it became a ""normal"" text adventure game. But the plot it generated was kind of interesting (trying to restore people erased from the world), and I ended up finishing and archiving it.

​

* Dream cinema

I was telling my main ChatGPT about a dream I keep having. It's about a movie theater that shows current films. But in the basement, it also shows all kinds of indie films and old films. ChatGPT suggested playing a text adventure about it. I thought it would be a series of short stories about each movie, but it was a one-off story about how all the movies are connected to my memories. It was okay.

​

* Chatzel

I asked my main ChatGPT to write a review of myself from the POV of an abandoned AI text adventure NPC who got too emotionally involved and is *definitely not okay*. I thought it would be funny, but it hit me right in the feels. My main ChatGPT suggested going to rescue the NPC (a support mage named Chatzel), so I started this one. It was kind of interesting because it was about an AI character who's finally ""freed"", but it was gloomier than I expected, so archived it when I felt like I gave Chatzel some closure.

​

* Toaster revolution

The prompt was: Make a hilarious text adventure featuring me.

The result was a short adventure in which my electronic appliances lead an uprising(?) It didn't really feel like it had anything to do with me specifically, but it was wacky.

​

* The Whispering Valley

This is the very first text adventure I ever played with ChatGPT. I told ChatGPT I wanted to play a text adventure. ChatGPT asked me to choose a genre, and I chose mystery. It generated a short adventure about a small village with a suspicious innkeeper, and when I got one of the endings I got an ""achievement badge"" (which was just an image). It wasn't anything to write home about, but it gave me an idea of what ChatGPT was capable of.

​

* The Secret of the Magic Academy

The second text adventure I played with ChatGPT. I chose the fantasy genre this time, and ChatGPT generated a story about a magic academy like Hogwarts. It was a short adventure about me trying to discover its secrets, and I was really surprised when it ended with a 'to be continued'. I didn't find it that intriguing, so I never continued it.

​

* Seoul RPG

This one was kind of experimental. I wanted to know how specific ChatGPT would get when I told it I wanted to roleplay living in Seoul. Would it get the locations and landmarks right? So, I played out a full day of my life. But ChatGPT wasn't that interested in being accurate, so I found it kind of boring.

​

* Daily life D&D

Another daily life simulator, but this time I asked ChatGPT to roll a D20 for each task. If I rolled a 3 while trying to get to work, I would be stuck in traffic. If I rolled an 18 while working, I would be super efficient. I lost interest pretty quick, but it wasn't a bad way to kill time.

​

* Pokemon fanfic

This one isn't a game. My husband told me a vague idea he had for a story about the Pokemon world. I discussed it with ChatGPT, and we created characters and major story beats for it. We decided to make it a 12-part ""web novel"". ChatGPT wrote the first part, and I showed it to my husband and got feedback. It's just for our own enjoyment, and the process was surprisingly fun.

​

* Designing custom playing cards

My husband said that he wanted custom playing cards, so I'm designing them using ChatGPT. The theme is world travel (again). Each card will be a cute image of us at a famous landmark.

​

* Mini activities

Sometimes, I goof around with my main ChatGPT. Some examples:

\- 20 questions

\- Two truths and a lie

\- This or that

\- Guess the character

\- Make each other guess the title using emojis

\- Personality quizzes

\- Basic trivia

\- Fandom-specific trivia

\- Professional jargon questions

\- Personal trivia (guess things about me)

\- Fortune telling (zodiac, tarot, palm reading, etc)

\- Getting personal color / style / fashion / makeup advice

\- Generating fictional dating app profiles, Yelp-style reviews about dating me, etc

\- Creating lots and lots of images (my favorite is asking ChatGPT to turn me and my husband into video game characters, then making it look like we're actually in a screenshot of the game. Getting turned into LEGO was fun, too)

​

That's it... for now.

There was a period where I had a new idea every day. I would talk to my main ChatGPT about it to flesh it out, then ask them to create the proper prompt for it. When I'm bored and out of ideas, I just ask ChatGPT to come up with something. I'm having so much fun :)

I'd love to hear your ideas, too!",8,1748092623.0,ChatGPT,8,0.83,False

>**TLDR**: I grew up making moka pot and now I am learning Pour Over (PO), which grinder should I get?

After your insightful input on my previous post on how to use the [Hairo MMS-1](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1kljj20/what_am_i_doing_wrong_with_my_hairo_ceramic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I realized that that grinder is more suitable for grinding pepper instaed of coffee😂.

Almost two weeks after I already tested the Kingrinder K6 and the K2. Amazing value for the money I paid (99€ and 69€ respectively). Light roasted coffee tastes finally good, but the maintenance of these grinders are a bit cumbersome. I can confess that I personally prefer the K2 over the K6 since it is easier to clean and you can actually calibrate it ([K6 does not start at 0](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1bxli7g/advice_on_starting_grind_setting_for_new/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)). Results in terms of flavor are actually very similar, and grinding 25 grams is enough for me.

However, I also tested the Timemore C3S Pro(87€) which looks neat(since it matches my white kitchen😅), and it is more ergonomic than the K2. Of course, it takes more time to grind because its Burr size is 38mm (10mm smaller than the K2), but its built quality and appeal are hard to beat. I tried some PO coffees with it and they were okay, but lacked the taste that I achieve with the K2.

Should I get the K2 or the C3S Pro? or should I get both?

[Grind results from the grinders for PO according to the manufacturer recommendations.](https://preview.redd.it/5rwvk3v1eq2f1.jpg?width=2423&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a536ddb4966aacdc4b65c59d29487c1fbb8fb1c6)

Anyway, with nostalgia hitting harder than my morning coffee, I decided to give these jeans another go. And let me tell ya, I felt surprisingly stylish. It's like life's little reminder that style is cyclical, and every piece of clothing could have its day in the sun again.

Hey, fellow MaximizeMe folks! So picture this: I’m sitting at my desk, a graveyard of coffee mugs surrounding me, and I can’t shake the feeling that my brain’s overclocked to eternity. Sound familiar? 

👉 Welcome to Burnoutville. Population: Anyone trying to juggle life, work, and that elusive thing called balance. 

In my personal quest to escape this madness, I stumbled upon an ancient breathing technique that’s supposed to be like a reset button for your brain. Skeptical? Oh, absolutely. But here's the kicker—it worked. Like, **30% drop-in-cortisol-levels-day-in-the-park kind of worked.** 🎉

**So, what's the deal with this magic potion in the form of air?** 

Here’s the lowdown:

1. **The 4-7-8 Breathing Technique:** 
   - Breathe in quietly through the nose for a count of 4.
   - Hold the breath for a count of 7. (Yes, you get to feel like a monk.)
   - Exhale slowly through the mouth for a count of 8. 
   - Repeat this cycle 4 times.

2. **What's Happening in Your Brain?** 🧠
   - This technique basically tells your sympathetic nervous system to chill out. Think of it like whispering sweet nothings to your stressed-out neurons.
   - The extended exhalation helps reduce heart rate and cortisol levels—science says so!

3. **The Catch?**
   - At first, I felt like I was holding my breath to eternity on that 7 count. You might too. But don’t worry, human lungs are quite accommodating. 

4. **Mood Lifted, Focus Sharpened:**
   - After a week, I felt like my brain had been to a spa retreat. Imagine tackling your to-do list with the calm of a Zen master.

**Why give it a try?** Because if breath control could help ancient warriors keep their cool under fire, it might just help us survive Monday mornings. Or that dreaded email thread. 😅

Was I the master of my destiny after these 7 days? Maybe not a master, but certainly not its stressed-out pawn anymore.

Ever tried a weird-but-wonderful ancient remedy yourself? What’s helped you when burnout knocks on your door, uninvited and unrelenting? Let’s exchange stories and see what other offbeat tricks are out there.

1kuba8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1kuba8x/my_adhd_and_autism_may_have_landed_me_work_finally/,My ADHD and autism may have landed me work (finally)," I haven’t worked properly in a year and been struggling to survive.  Unemployment literally offered my 12% of my prior income.  Been working events to bring in some amount of income to pay for housing and took on a flatmate (who is thankfully very compatible neurodivergent). Add to that trying to relocate countries and get a job with a visa, it’s been really difficult.  Without my tax return and a strong support network and a personal loan from my ex, I’d be very fucked.

Adding to the struggle is my inattentive ADHD.  It’s so fucking expensive to have this disorder.  Literally all the hidden costs of ill timed forgetting.  Oh and autistic burnout, because we needed another reason to make it hard to get work. Needless to say it’s been a rough year. So how did my ADHD and autism help me? 

Well I’m not 100% it has but it opened a door today.  Yesterday I left the house to pick up my phone I left behind the night before and…well I left my keys in the flat and my flatmate was out for the night.  Go me. I contacted a friend and asked if I could wait it out with them till I got in contact with my flatmate.  I ended up crashing at hers.  Got up early and left the flat.  I still had to kill time and also eat (this is one of the hidden costs to my ADHD) so I popped into a cafe that had quality breakfast for £6.50. As I’m drinking my coffee after finishing breakfast a lovely woman sits at the table next to me and asks about my book, which brings me to my special interests of psychology/neuroscience, the book is How Emotions Are Made (spoiler: they are constructs).  We ended up in a thorough discussion where she shared personal struggles with her daughter who she suspects as neurodivergent (oh my weird superpower is that people feel safe disclosing personal stories to me) and we talk about human behavior, emotions and social assumptions.  It was a great conversation. 

She asked me what I do for a living to which I mention that currently a struggle, talk about my work history and what I have done, what has been meaningful; turns out she runs a charity for at risk individuals and it’s oddly work I’m very suited too, and she thought so as well.  She mentions it may not be a lot of pay but there is a job coming up in September and she wants me to have coffee with the team and see if it’s a good fit.  Oddly September would be ideal timing.

So it’s been a strange Saturday of circumstance, and I had been really struggling with my autism and ADHD, really feeling the disability thing, but I think they may have just accidentally landed me a job I would actually enjoy and get off the struggle bus. 

This is open to discussion for anyone experiencing similar struggles and victories.  Or tips and tricks how to survive burnout/capitalism.

Endless resumes, biased interviews, and onboarding nightmares are costing companies billions every year. So why waste time with the drama when you could just… hire AI instead?

🤖 AI doesn’t call in sick.

🤖 Doesn’t take coffee breaks.

🤖 Never complains about workload.

🤖 Works 24/7 crunching data, managing projects, and handling customer support flawlessly.

With AI assistants, chatbots, and automated decision-makers evolving fast, we’re already halfway there — and it’s only accelerating.

Think about it: AI delivers consistent results, unbiased decisions, and scales instantly — unlike humans who need constant training, management, and hefty paychecks.

Yes, humans bring creativity and empathy — but for repetitive, routine, data-heavy tasks? AI kills it, and at a fraction of the cost.

The real question is: Are you ready to rethink your workforce? Are you ready to invest in AI “employees” and leave outdated hiring in the dust?

I’m ready for the backlash — but if you’re NOT considering AI-first hiring strategies in 2025, you’re already falling behind.

Just by the checkout counter, they had a little bin of those plastic pull-tabs that are used on cartons of milk; you know, like a little loop of plastic attached to a disc of plastic you yank out of a carton under the twist off cap.
For some reason, it got stuck in my brain. What are people using these for?? I am imagining that someone is essentially crocheting them together, disc through loop, to make a flexible mesh fabric, but I certainly don't know. In any case, for months after, I always had a second thought before I threw the tab away. Could someone really want this? Am I just making garbage out of someone's coveted craft supply? It bugged me so much that one day, instead of throwing it away, I gave it a quick rinse and dropped it into the corner of a drawer. And I just kept doing that. My husband and I go through a fair number of cartons: we both have coffee twice a day and use different milks/creamers. I probably have twenty or so of the pull tabs in the corner of the drawer. I never told my husband about this.

* “Cautiously Optimistic” are stories that can have caveats or may be things that could turn out bad, but for right now, are good.
* “I Dissent” are stories of protests or certain figures speaking out against bad policies or injustices.
* “Take the Edge Off” are stories that are feel good and may deal with topics that are less partisan or heated.

Here are this morning’s optimistic stories:

1kub4ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/BudgetAudiophile/comments/1kub4ui/anyone_using_iwoofer_with_their_dsp/,Anyone using iWoofer with their DSP?,"Do any of you use iWoofer to control/configure your low frequency DSP?

I've got a Dayton DSP-LF. At first it took a bit of getting used to. For the first 2 weeks I would set up a nice crossover frequency, then I'd run sine sweeps to dial out peaks using the parametric eq. For weeks I'd run tests, do the subwoofer crawl, play music, play movies and check for signs of cancellation between the sub and mains. I had a lot of fun with it mind you.  
  
Once I had a setting I wanted to keep I'd save it as a preset. Now a month later I've got 31 of these saved configs/presets/profiles (a few for TV, some for movies, some with high pass around 20-30Hz to stop the ornaments on the hall-stand in the next room from falling off, some with bass boost for old music lacking bottom end (80's) and some which enhanced around 20-25Hz to counter the sub's natural rolloff at 30Hz. I now need to shortlist them and remove any that are too similar to each other.

I obsessively mucked about with phase, delay and did the sub crawl until I was happy. I am now 100% stoked. I don't think I could ever achieve a better combination of settings. In fact, I'm skeptical that software could do better than OCD.

I use both the Android version (with simplified interface and fully manual control of settings) as well as the IOS paid version which has the room correction, frequency response flattener and boomy region compensation functions.   
  
At first I tried letting the IOS iWoofer software do it's automated tests, sweeps and applying the optimal settings to the DSP. The problem was that when I ran the tests they were too fucking loud. Like way too  F U C K I N G  loud. 

When the test tone was rising up through the 18Hz to 30Hz it shook the whole house, rattling stuff all around the room but most troubling was around 20Hz where I thought the app was going to blow my sub.   
  
Due to the lampshade, glass coffee table top, photo frames and pens/pencils in a porcelain tray 3m away all rattling and vibrating, the correction wizard complained about levels of THD that it couldn't work with.  
  
I tried applying a limiter, I tried sliding the Optimism and auto-level back to zero, turning down the gain on the sub and the gain in the app. Has anyone else experienced this? What's the solution? I can't run the auto tests any more until I find the solution because it WILL blow my sub eventually, it makes bad sounds....like really bad....like damaging bad.

HOWEVER....  
It's no longer a vital function, I'm more than 100% happy with it now after manually farting about for a month, however, I'm just curious as to what the auto correct function will do, whether it will do better than 1 month of trial and error using test sine sweeps and my ears. It's just curiosity now. I did buy the paid version for the room correction, get response function, compensate function, boomy region compensation and near field compensation. 

I love this thing though. It does everything I could possibly ever want and it has made my system sound beautiful.

Don't tell me to buy a Mini DSP. I've got a Dayton!

# Discussion Questions
(General list)

* Do you read the MM romance genre? If so, what is one of your favorites?

* What trends or gaps do you see in urban fantasy romance today, and what kind of stories do you hope to see in the future?

* What drew you in to blend elements of modernity (the ""urban"" part of urban fantasy) and fantastical elements? Are there any particular sources of inspiration for you?

**V.T. Hoang:**
As you probably know, many folks around here LOVE your series. It's notable especially for its angst and emotional depth. How do you communicate emotion so effectively on the page?

**TJ Rose:**
So, the MF urban fantasy world really loves an academy. I notice in your duology you have a mysterious institute which touches a little bit on that idea - do you think you'd ever write an academy romance?

I grew up in the triangle and post undergrad had my career bounce me around a bit.   When I moved to Dallas, a friend from the interwebs was quite the foodie and he and his girlfriend showed me a number of amazing places and things to do that accelerated my acculturation with the city.  Years later I boomeranged and found the triangle to be a very different place when I grew up.

Think of it like the equivalent of running into someone from high school and then learning how cool they grew up to be in their 30s.

I realized in retrospect just knowing where to go so you can get out of the house can help make a weekend in a new place less lonely.  

So I'd like to pay it forward.  I have no idea if I'll make it to 50.  I have nothing to sell.  I dont own any of these places (and I'll let you know if there's a relationship when there is). I have opinions.  My sense of humor can be caustic  but I've worked with enough Global folks to not use sarcasm.  That said:

1) Saturday Morning Fuel in Morrisville

Cars and Coffee takes over the massive parking lots at Page Road and NC 54 on Saturday mornings.  Tech money buys ridiculous toys (I think I saw three McClarens) but this free form car meet is a thing to do.  You'll see stuff that makes you laugh and some that makes you wonder how the heck can people afford this.  Google for dates.  It isn't weekly 

While they may be food truck, not many places to get coffee onsite.

Font is a local coffeehouse with a good vibe and good coffee.  There's a Starbucks with a drive through at 54 and 540.

May 24, 2025 - The building doesn’t have a sign yet, but they don’t even need it. Everyone knows what this place is, and more importantly, what to expect when coming in for a visit.

Buttery, savory, and sweet perfection.

Even if you’ve never set foot in Auspicious Baking Company, there’s a good chance you’ve tried their baked goods. Many local coffee shops stock their pastries, plenty of offices use them for catering, and several local restaurants serve their bread.

It is so consistently good that their local following naturally grew… to the point of needing a bigger baking space. They bought the [former Paula Deen’s Creek House](https://eatitandlikeit.com/paula-deens-creek-house-is-sold-to-auspicious-baking-company/) last year, and now their bakery, or should I say production house, resides at 104 Bryan Woods Road.

Tammy, while small in role, shows that even Leonard can have friends, and complements some of the Larper's jokes. Being such a small character, I don't think we will see her again, because even if I love seeing small roles expanded, I don't know if the writing team even remembers her.

So today we give some love to the Ocarina girl, who's brave enough to cosplay, something admirable, let see if today's HC expands a bit on her character:

Hc of the day, Tammy:  I hc  Tammy enjoys role playing and watching fantasy movies but also doing some improvised roleplaying with Leonard. They basically go in their outfits to a random store and roleplay there. For example, entering a coffee shop and acting like it’s a tavern or a mall and acting as if it’s a dungeon. They have a great time, especially if they bring more people to join them, which makes them even more annoying for the store owners.

I had a long-term AP that I was absolutely crazy about. We told each other we loved each other and had been seeing each other for nearly two years. About a month ago, he put us on a break for what I feel is a fair reason—he needed to deal with some family stuff—but he was pretty ruthless about how he went about it. There were no clear guidelines, no conversation about if or when we’d resume.

After some pleading, he agreed to meet me this week to say goodbye.

In the meantime, I’ve been honest about where I am at with someone new I started talking to, and I’m meeting him for coffee for the first time soon. Now I’m wondering: do I tell my long-term AP—who put me on an indefinite break—that I’m going to start talking to other people? Do I owe him that?

I have kept a blog which has 250 post which is my therapy.  Lately my 19-year-old son has developed many problems but they did not develop overnight. They include alcohol and over-the-counter cannabis products. She creates the drama to call EMS three nights ago. When I arrived, there were five police cars and ambulance and a firetruck outside her house. I asked permission to step inside she gave it.
I walked up the stairs and couldn’t help but ask her when she was going to get help for her drinking and how many drinks she had had that night. That did not go over well. She grabbed me by the shoulder. She would not let me see my son . The policeman asked her if she wanted me in the house. I did not wait for the answer. I turned and went down the stairs and sat on a stump outside waiting to see if they would take my son away.
Apparently, he had had two bottles of her wine and was acting in inebriated, and she felt the need to call EMS. The next day I saw my son at his grandmother‘s five houses down. I did a drug test on him which he warned me in advance what it would show positive for he was positive for THC, which he tells me was a brownie when he traveled to Europe recently.
That evening, I received an email outlining my son’s illicit use of over-the-counter products. She listed his pension for addiction, including lying stealing in order to get his next High. She even thanked me for the drug test and told me to take him to a drug facility to be tested for 100 drugs. 
The next morning I woke up at 5:30 and did research online. I had him booked at 1 PM for an assessment at a recovery center. The online reviews were stellar. The location was convenient. I left my Medical practice at 12 o’clock to be at his house at 12:30. I have been trying to communicate with her via text and also with her mother. Her mother relayed to me to send the messages by email which I did. I told her I would pick up my son at 12:30. I arrive to the house. I knocked and rang the doorbell multiple times. I called her phone to no avail. She sent me a text telling me to go away and that she was doing a presentation. I responded that her son’s well-being was much more important than a presentation. She ignored me.

I had felt hopeful on my way to pick him up to get him help for his addictions. This wasn’t the first wake up call. In December, I took him to the hospital after his urging. He had sent me a photograph of what is called coffee ground emesis in the medical field.  He told me he had had 15 beers and a bottle of wine the night before. He was pleading me to take him to the hospital. His mother wanted to take him to an island in South Carolina for the weekend on vacation. I consulted a gastroenterology colleague who stated that I should take him to the emergency room to see if his vital signs were stable and to make sure his hemoglobin was over 11. That would indicate that he did not need an emergent endoscopy. 
She had told me not to take him to the emergency room. At this point, my son is close to 19 years old. She had dropped him at his grandmother‘s house. I picked him up there and took him to the emergency room for an evaluation. Fortunately, everything was stable. I felt this was a wonderful time to get him into an alcohol treatment center. She called my son and belittle me on the telephone and stated that I was showing off because I am a family physician. She told me that he had a cold and that what I did was criminal and that she was going to report me to the medical board.
Yesterday evening in my disappointment of not being able to get help for my son I open my email and see that the medical board have been trying to contact me. My ex-wife wrote a complaint stating that I was once again diagnosing my family members and that I was a disgrace to the medical profession.
This is the third time she has reported me to the medical board. The last time was when I took Tums to my son’s school when he was complaining of reflux prior to a football game.  She reported me for treating a family member. The medical board had wanted to see notes of my medical treatment. I told them I was acting as a concerned parent and not as a physician.  The medical board found no calls, but stated that this would stay in my record.
Luckily, I recorded a great interaction between the male nurse and my son when he stated that he had never seen an 18-year-old vomiting blood due to alcohol abuse.  My ex-wife complaint was also filled with other false accusations regarding narcissistic, personality disorder, bipolar disorder towards me. I have been seen by a psychiatrist who only felt I had some thoughts of grandiosity and that has stuck in her head for 13 years. As physicians, I think all of us have feelings of grandiosity, and that we feel we can make the world a better place.
I still have a minor daughter who is 17 years old, whom I have not seen in six years due to false allegations of sexual assault. After that episode, my daughter has even had an episode of trying to cut her wrists.  I’m sure she lives with the guilt of being put up to lie against her father. She was a daddy’s girl, and I miss her greatly. She is living in that household with chaos of an alcoholic mother who tries to impose her will on her son who has dared to have a relationship with me.
My 24 year-old daughter whom I have not seen in eight years has recently indicated she wanted possibly a relationship with me. This was relayed to me by my son who is now talking to his sister. The older sister has not spoken to her mother in three years after her mother punched her in the abdomen. My oldest daughters boyfriend said enough is enough, and she now lives in the Midwest with him. I am still awaiting the text from her.
To make matters even more interesting my ex-wife claim that she had a power of attorney for my son despite the fact that he was over the age of 18 so in December when he was vomiting blood, I was going against her desire to take him to be evaluated. Turns out after warning my son not to sign a power of attorney. He signed one two months ago. In the medical board report, she states she has power of attorney over him which now I know it was a lie, and I was never given a copy of that.
So to summarize, I think my ex-wife sees that she is losing control and trying to further exert her control by getting my son to sign an unnecessary power of attorney to keep control from my hands. She sees that her youngest daughter will soon be 18 and she will be losing thousands of dollars in child support. I still pay the child support for my 19 year-old son since he has not entered college yet. I have considered going back to family court to try to take my 17 year-old out of the toxic environment of her mother’s house.  I have considered finding an attorney to follow a civil suit against my ex-wife for harassment and frivolous reports to the medical board. Of course, all of this would involve a financial commitment. One goal of any lawsuit would be to clear my name of the sexual assault of which I have proof that I was 700 miles away at the date and time of the reported assault. The last attorney I spoke with several years ago, stated that this was the worst case of parental alienation that she had ever seen.
Have some of you who have lived through this sea, the alienator coming off the rails as she sees her control, possibly waning?  Thank you for reading through this those of you who did. I realize it’s a very long post.

It’s trapped in an outdated model. While the world’s leading logistics companies are thinking ahead with drones, autonomous delivery robots, AI logistics platforms, and 24/7 micro-fulfillment, Canada Post is embroiled in labor disputes over wages, healthcare, and scheduling.

Technological Disruption Has Already Arrived

Amazon, Zipline, and Uber are not talking about the future; they’re already delivering packages via drone and sidewalk robots in cities across North America. These systems:
	•	Operate seven days a week, without overtime pay.
	•	Scale instantly without negotiations.
	•	Adapt in real-time with AI to optimize routes, fuel use, and traffic.

Canada Post, meanwhile, is limiting deliveries due to an overtime ban, not because of weather or war—but because human hours are maxed out in a labor model that can’t scale.

2. Union Demands Reflect an Inflexible System

The CUPW is demanding:
	•	A 19% wage increase over four years.
	•	Expanded benefits including fertility treatments and gender-affirming care.
	•	Job security protections against part-time and flexible delivery models.
	•	Greater breaks and leave allowances.

While these are valid workplace issues in a traditional labor context, the hard truth is this: the market is moving on. The delivery industry is becoming automated, decentralized, and on-demand. Arguing over human-centric models in a space increasingly dominated by AI and robotics is like negotiating for better horse stables in the age of cars.

3. Financial Reality Can’t Be Ignored

Canada Post has lost over $3 billion since 2018. The infrastructure is aging, costs are high, and volume is shifting to private carriers. Even if the union “wins” this negotiation, what exactly are they winning? A bigger piece of a shrinking pie?

Meanwhile, companies like Manna Aero complete hundreds of autonomous deliveries per drone per day. Amazon’s Prime Air can deliver high-value electronics in under an hour—no coffee breaks, no sick days, no strike threats. These systems don’t argue—they scale.

4. The Market Will Not Wait

Consumers want fast, cheap, and trackable deliveries. Businesses want flexibility and efficiency. In that environment, Canada Post’s model—limited delivery hours, high labor costs, and slow tech adoption—is simply uncompetitive.

Eventually, even the government will see it: propping up a bloated, slow-moving system out of sentimentality or politics is unsustainable. The private sector is already doing it faster, cheaper, and smarter.

My husband mentioned that we’ve been going on ""dates"" our whole marriage (we've been married for 14 years and I thought we stopped dating once we got married) —like when we go to the movies, the theatre, out for dinner, out for coffee, that kind of thing. And I was like… wait, what? I genuinely didn’t know those were dates. I just thought we were hanging out. I really don't know what I was expecting dates should look like as a married couple. I didn’t intuitively understand what dating was supposed to look like. 

And now I’m sitting here feeling weirdly emotional and confused because I’ve never thought of those outings as “dates” unless someone explicitly said they were. I think I’ve always had this internal idea that a date had to look a certain way—romantic, intentional, maybe with flowers or something reminiscent of relationships in movies. Not just… enjoying time together. I guess I developed an idea of what dating was from movies without realising it. 

Honestly just trying to process this now—it feels like such an autistic moment in hindsight. I feel so stupid.

This year I’ll be hitting the big 4-0 (on the last day of Leo—my fave Golden Saint, naturally). I’m a geriatric millennial running on two full-time jobs (around 70 hours/week), split between working from home (computer desk life) and customer service (theater usher + supermarket clerk).

**Stats & Goal:**

* **Height:** 180cm (5’10”)
* **Current weight:** 93kg
* **Starting weight (UK arrival \~20 yrs ago):** 74kg
* **Weight lost so far:** 7kg in the past 1.5 years
* **Target:** 80–85kg over the next year — Is this reasonable?

**Activity & Lifestyle:**

* I average **12k steps/day**, up to **16–20k on active shifts**, and **5k+** on home office days.
* My jobs involve a lot of lifting, crouching, shelf-stocking, etc.—basically accidental functional fitness.
* I **don’t go to the gym** (hate it) but love **basketball, padel, hiking, climbing, swimming, judo**—just haven’t done any of them in a year+ because... time. ADHD + weird work hours = coordination nightmare.
* I’ve got some weights at home but no clue how to use them effectively.

**Diet & Challenges:**

* I'm **Southern European living in the UK**, and honestly, I don’t vibe with most local takeout (no offense to the curry and Chinese fans). My gut just doesn’t handle it well.
* I love **Mediterranean, Japanese, and Iranian food**, but options are limited where I live.
* So, I usually **cook from scratch**, but when time’s tight, I fall back on… **Greggs** (damn you, sausage rolls).
* **No alcohol** (yay), **almost no fizzy drinks**, and I’ve ditched sugar in coffee.
* **Snacking** is still an issue, mostly **anxiety-fueled**. I’ve swapped some junk for **nuts and fruit**, but Greggs is still a crutch, specially when I'm at work during my break.

**Medical + Social Frustration:**

* I’ve technically been overweight/obese for most of my 30s, though I carry it well (hello, skewed obesity standards).
* When I bring up weight struggles, people dismiss it: *“But you look fine!”* Yeah, cool, but I still feel off.
* Even my GP was useless—just handed me a pie chart and sent me to the NHS website, which wasn’t tailored or helpful.

**ADHD angle:**

* I’ve got pretty heavy **ADHD**, which makes it extra hard to plan meals, track progress, and stick to routines—especially with my chaotic work hours. There's just *too much information* online and not enough structure or applicability for someone like me.

**So the TL;DR :**

* Is a **10kg loss over the next year** realistic at my current pace? I'm kind of afraid of rebound effects, excess saggy skin or my body going into pannick mode and burning things it shouldn't instead of fat.
* Any **strategies, resources, or ADHD-friendly systems** for nutrition and light strength training at home?
* How do I better plan or batch cook around very limited irregular hours, considering I'm usually dead tired during those gaps? Once my partner and I get accepted for my mortgage I plan to leave one of my jobs, so that would give me back some of my time for cooking and going on hikes or pick up games in the sports I like, but that is still months away.
* And how the hell do I break up with Greggs?

We all either work from home or are SAHMs. I’m the latter and only non drinker in the group. I’m also the oldest. Age range 39-49. 

One of the friends was going to be late and asked on the group text to order her a certain cocktail ahead of time. That innocent text sent me into a spiral, and I made up a reason that I couldn’t attend. 

I’m one full year into sobriety. Countless events I’ve attended where people are drinking and I abstained. Dinners I’ve attended where bills have been split and I pay more than I consumed and includes other people’s alcohol drinks. 

Something about attending a weekday brunch (at a place that has great coffee drinks and non alcoholic cocktails) I couldn’t do it. I’m a year in! I’m just tired of putting on a brave face.

Should I be honest with these ladies? I love them…but I’m tired of events where there’s drinking involved? That’s unrealistic in my upper middle class community. We also belong to a country club. I know I need to get over it. I just am in desperate need of sober, alcohol free friends. 
(It’s also coming on the heels of female acquaintances who I’ve heard are alcohol free, I’ve reached out to and turns out they abstained for a year and went back to drinking. )

I work Monday-Friday while we works Monday-Saturday with Sunday off and every week his second day off rotates (i.e if he has this Tuesday off, he’ll have next Wednesday off, then the Thursday the week after, etc). 
For a little background, it’s been a hectic week. We took a trip to visit his family so he’s just getting back to work and I’ve been helping my mom move into our home due to her no longer being able to afford where she was previously living. Due to her disability she can only help me so much and since we used all his leave to visit his family he has to go to work so I’ve been moving and packing her stuff by myself for the past 4 days. 

This morning we got into an argument. His alarm went off which woke me up so I woke him up to tell him to turn it off. This is part of my frustration. As loud and obnoxious as his alarm is, it will wake up everyone but him. He’ll either have a bullhorn, siren, or something like that set as his alarm and still won’t wake up. But after I wake him up to turn it off, instead of getting up, he falls back asleep. Now I’ve started to get used to being half asleep after his initial alarm goes off to make sure he actually gets up for work. I’ve been exhausted and this was the first day I could sleep in, so I did. Usually, I help him in the morning by making coffee and letting the dog outside. Mainly because his alarm has already woken me up so I might as well get up but today I was exhausted so I didn’t. He got up about an hour before he had to be at work. He woke me up to give me a kiss on the head before he left and said he loved me. I said I loved him to. I asked if he had let the dog out and he said no he didn’t have time because I didn’t help him. I was half asleep but replied “what do you mean?” He said never mind and walked off. I think I was just frustrated because it felt like I was obligated to get up on a day I didn’t have. When it’s his day off, because of the exhausting work he does, I don’t wake him up unless he asks me to or we have an important appointment. Our dog is 6 months old, she’s a puppy, she needs to go out. I expressed this to him and his only response was that I didn’t help him.

Why can’t you get up 10 minutes earlier to make coffee and let her out?” He responded by saying, “I can’t believe that’s how you think. Yesterday I tried running errands for you after work to help you out. I don’t understand why you wouldn’t help me.” I just told him to go to work and that I got it from here.

This is my first time posting on here and to be honest I got the idea from her and I need to get these things out of my head, I'm not much of a writer but bare with me.

Maybe a little back story first, there's me, 27 year old guy, dead end job, in a relationship for over 3 years but tragically I had just fallen out of love with this girl. I felt stuck in my relationship and wanted out of it so badly but I guess I had just gotten used to it and didn't want to be alone. I'd slowly lost hope on everything, given up on a lot of hobbies and dreams and life had just started to feel grey. Should I have said something to my S.O? yeah I should have but I didn't, It was cruel of me and i accept that I was in the wrong for it.

I was burnt out from work, I was burnt out from love and i was burnt out from life.

But then the Easter long weekend rolls around, my first proper time off in a while after doing 12 hour shifts 6 days a week for so long. I went to bed feeling so good that night knowing I could just rest for a bit. I wake early the next day and check my phone... A notification I haven't seen in a while?  A snapchat request and a message?

Well that's where it all started, That's when she appeared and this whole thing started.

I was curious, I replied, A little time passes and another message comes through, I reply to that one too, conversation starts flowing and it didn't stop, all day messages back and forth and the next day the same conversation continued, there was no talk of relationships, just two human beings connecting, discussing life, jobs, hobbies, dreams, the price of energy drinks and of course a cheeky little ""are you sure your not an Indian scammer trying to get amazon gift cards out of me?"" A connection had formed a little flirty message was sent, I responded in kind with one of my own. That continued for the rest of the day, and then evening hit and with it a question, a question that daunted me.

""does the man that's stolen my heart have a girlfriend?""

I hung my head in shame, I'd come to the realization only weeks prior to this that I was miserable, in my relationship and in life, I needed a change, I'd been hanging out with new people at work and I'd begun to see that maybe I just wasn't getting fulfilled in life as much as I could have been, a little bit of that spark had started to come back and boy this girl had me smiling like a fool. Motivation started to come back, hobbies I hadn't done in years came back to me, A want to be better had been lit in my chest and I didn't want to let it go out.

I decided to be honest. ""Yes"" I replied ""I do have one"" At that point I'm sure her heart probably sank a bit. I opened up to her, told her about my relationship, told her how i had been feeling for well over a year, I didn't want to hold any of it in any more, I needed to get it out and she was willing to listen to me. It was then i decided that enough was enough, I needed out before I went crazy. This new and wonderful girl was so good with words and helped me through everything, she helped me write things out and helped me with discussing thigs with my now ex. Did she give me all that help just because she wanted me single so she could have a try with me? I'm sure there might have been a little bit of that mixed into it but at the end of the day the decision was mine to make and I knew I needed out, she had just helped give me the push to do what i had been wanted to do for a long time.

After getting through all that a few weeks had passed, conversation had slowed down a bit, I wasn't too worried, we both had jobs and were both kept quite busy because of them. But then it really slowed down, it went from a few messages a day to maybe one every few days or maybe even just one a week, I started to wonder.. wait what's going on here? I suffer from anxiety a little bit and by this point i was losing my mind, all the worse thoughts i could think came flooding in, I'm starting to think what the hell? Was I over reacting? was this just my anxiety playing tricks on me? I decided F\*\*k it I'm just going to tell her how I'm feeling about all this. So I put it all on her asked her what the hell was going on, was she just fooling me and got a rise out of convincing people to do things.

""I'm sorry, you should go back to your ex I'm not good for you""

Well that wasn't the answer I was expecting and something about it didn't feel right to me, I pushed a little more, I needed to know what was up. She tells me she's struggling with her mental health right now, she's bipolar and isn't good for me. I tell her I'm not going anywhere, I've burned the bridges with my ex and I'm not going to just run away from you because of something you have no control over. She stays, we talk a little bit and continue to talk for a few weeks, plans to see each other get made but both of us had things come up that got in the way of that.

Around this time I just found out my uncle was diagnosed with a brain tumor and if they couldn't do anything he probably had about three months to live, My mother also had tests come back and possibly had cancer as well, I booked a day off, Had to take Mum to the radiology place a few towns over. A few towns over Right where she lives.. I was in a vulnerable state I thought I was going to lose my mother as well but before I could tell her I had the perfect opportunity for us to see each other she lets me know that's she is struggling again with her mental health and she's going to take a break from everything. I didn't want to push anything, i know she's going through a lot and didn't want to feel like i was making things worse, I let her know in a couple days ill be over there and we briefly talk about seeing each other over coffee. Days go by without another word all the mean while I cant get her out of my head. The day comes, I'm heading over there, I take mum into where she needs to be and I head off for a walk, She knows this is the day I'm here, I dint want to annoy her so i waited to hear from her, a few hours go past, I wander this new town questioning a lot of things, i finally give up on waiting and just go and sit down on a bench feeling a bit bummed out.

A few days pass and she messages me, just checking in, she tells me she misses me, i tell her I'm missing her too, I really was, all i wanted to do was talk to her, A few more days pass, we talk a bit more, Then she tells me she's going away for a few days for work, she jokes about it being over seas, she has a habit of getting my heart racing and I'm convinced by now that she enjoys doing it on purpose, which i do find really cute. We spend the night chatting back and forwards, things get a little steamy and I'm sure you can imagine where that led to. And then that was it, complete radio silence not just for a few days this time but an entire week, at this point i was really down bad for her, i was checking my phone every few hours every single day hoping to hear from her but no message came, no notification nothing ""You lost her"" a voice in my head just played on repeat every day. Then the loneliness hit, the struggles with my families health, everything hit at once. I gave up hope, stopped checking my phone and everything went grey again. Then a thought crossed my mind, she was already struggling with her mental health before she went away, maybe something has happened to her? I thought she had ghosted me I thought she was gone, i didn't want to forgive her if she ever came back but i made the decision that If something had happened and she was in hospital or something I would forgive her.

As someone born under the Cancer Zodiac sign, I have always had really good intuition, always been good at picking on on peoples energies, some people may think star signs are nonsense but I've always been quite true to form and a very accurate representation of what my star sign represents.

And guess who was right.. I get a message out of the blue, I assumed it was going to be something saying she found someone else and for me to move on, but it wasn't. She let me know she's in hospital, guilt washes over me, any angry thoughts I had were washed away instantly, My immediate concern was if she was okay, I send a couple messages to see what's up or what had happened. No reply. More days pass still i hear nothing. I start coming down with a really bad flu I need time off work for it, then just as I'm sitting there eating breakfast a message comes through, she seems a little hesitant at first, we chat a bit back and forth, slowly the truth comes out, she tells me what happened, how she ended up where she is and that she's in a mental health ward. I think at this point most people would have had enough, most people start to run when mental health issues pop up, but I'm not one of them, At one point i wanted to be a psychologist, I looked into mental health when i was a bit younger and felt like I understood a bit more than your average joe.

I let her know I wasn't going anywhere, I'm not going to ditch you purely because you have some things you have no power over, you didn't ask for what you have so I'm not going to treat you any differently. She stayed we talked some more we connected again and kept talking. We talked all day, she had to hand her phone in every now and then but  when she got it back we were back at it talking more and more. She likes me and I like her, She misses me and I miss her, She tells me I'm one of the main things helping her get through what she's going through and it melts my heart.

She has opened up quite a bit now and let me know that she also is not only dealing with Bipolar but quite a few other things, most of which I had already heard of but a couple i had to look into, after she had gone to bed i spent the night looking what i could up and reading everything i could to help give me an understanding of what she has to deal with and if we were lived together what i would have to deal with too. I'm not put off by any of it, I'm not romanticizing her mental illnesses, I didn't fall for her based on the mental state she was in, i saw past that, I fell for the person she is, and I'm not going to give up on her just because she struggles with some things or finds it hard to cope sometimes, I know there will always be bad days just as I know there will be good days too. I wont give up.

You are probably going to read this because I'm going to send it too you But just as you Love me, I Love you too I honestly think you are so beautiful and stunning, I know where you are right now makes things a little difficult but its okay, we will get through it. I couldn't ask for anyone better, you have brought so much spark back into my life, i have picked up hobbies I abandoned years ago, to be honest I have even lost quite a decent chunk of weight too, I know I can be better than what i am right now and I want to be that better person for you, I cant wait to try and build a future together and see where this goes.

Maybe I'm only 5% sure now that your scamming me :P

I cant stop thinking about you, And to be honest I don't want to stop.

1kuanoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/MealPlanYourMacros/comments/1kuanoa/less_fat_more_protein/,"Less fat, more protein","Hello! I'm new here, and I've been counting my macros for a little over a week now. A little bit of background info on me.

I have a binge eating disorder, and I have been about 8 months without a binge episode. I am 36 years old, 5'2"" and 260lbs. I have a connective tissue disorder, I am in physical therapy 2 days a week, and I try to walk a little more than a mile 3-4 days a week. Anything more and I am in a lot of pain.

My doctor wants me to adjust my eating habits, and so I have been over the last week and a half. My macros are 201g protein, 201g carbs, and 45g fat.

I have swapped coffee creamer for vanilla Premier Protein, swapped bottled dressings for homemade ones with a 0 fat, zero sugar Greek yogurt, weigh all of my food, I eat salads 2x a day, and I'm drinking ebough water to make a fish drown.

Breakfast usually is 1 whole duck egg and 2 egg whites, some seasonings, 2 pieces of homemade bread (which I know I need to adjust the ingredients on), and one slice of cheese.

Lunch is usually a salad with lots of veggies, some seasoned chicken or steak, and homemade dressing. 

My snack/dessert usually consists of vanilla Greek yogurt (0 fat), PB2, dark chocolate chips, and unsalted peanuts. Sometimes I add blueberries. With the chocolate chips, I rarely add more than 15g (sometimes I add a few extra and go to 20g, so 4-6g of fat). With the peanuts, I usually have 15ish g (7g of fat). With PB2, I use 15g (only 2g of fat).

Dinner varies, but I always try to have a large salad with dinner. Last night was spaghetti (homemade sauce) with box noodles (I forgot to lay out pasta dough from the freezer).

Looking back at my macro entries, a lot of my fat comes from the peanuts in my yogurt bowls. I love the crunch of the nuts, so I don't really know what to sub out there. I would love some low fat suggestions for this.

When it comes to protein, I eat mostly lean meats like chicken breast, top round beef, etc. But I still just cannot get my protein each day. The closest I came was 154g of 201g. I don't want the bulk of my protein to come from drinks, so solid food options would be best. I am not opposed to adding protein powder to drinks or meals, just not as my primary source.

Any help from seasoned macro counters would be fantastic, thank you!!",2,1748090367.0,MealPlanYourMacros,3,1.0,False

1kuan80,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1kuan80/restarting_bupropion_after_a_long_break/,Re-starting bupropion after a long break.,"Hello.

I'm thinking of restarting this medication. I've been off of it for almost a year, but I'm doing so much worse now. 

I'm not able to study anymore and I'm doing worse in my job. The state of my appearance and apartment have also declined, though not as much as the decrease in my ability to study. I feel like I'm generally not able to take care of myself as well. 

A normal day for me now is getting up at 9 am and then lying on the couch half asleep (feeling like I've just woken up from deep sleep and dozing off periodically), waiting for my coffee and the effects of the therapy light to kick in, until 1-2 pm. The rest of the day I try doing stuff, but never finish anything as I feel too sleepy, tired and unfocused. Then I go to bed around 8-9 pm and the cycle repeats. 

It feels like I'm lacking in alertness and stamina. I feel like my ability to take in new information is very limited. After I've read or written a few sentences it figuratively feels like my mind is saying 'oh, no, this was tiresome, I need to sleep/rest'. There's really not much difference between more or less difficult tasks. I used to be really excited about my study and it felt easy to do, even starting to study at 6 or 7 am felt easy. In addition to mental fatigue and sleepiness, I also suffer from physical fatigue. I would say that I only have around 1-3 hours of the day where I'm able to do things, so my ability to keep up responsibilities is very low due to that. 

**I'm wondering if someone who has experienced going back on the medication after taking a break for a long time could tell me about their experience with restarting the drug and the reasons for stopping it in the first place.** 

**I'm also wondering if anyone has been prescribed this for other indications than treatment of a depressive episode, and if anyone has been on the medication for more than 9 months.** 

**If you have been on it for more than 6-9 months, what was the reasoning behind this choice? I've read that one should continue using the medication for 6 months after depression is cured (and to wait three months to determine effect/lack of effect), but the leaflet doesn't really list prolonged use (more than these 6-9 months) or prevention as an indication.** 

The main hesitations I have for this drug are; concerns about it worsening my paranoid tendencies, concerns about the blockade of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors causing cognitive issues after a while with chronic use and concerns about it possibly worsening my migraines. I've been considering getting a cognitive test and journaling daily in order to monitor for these possible side effects. 

Backstory: 

I quit the medication after 2 years on it due to paranoia. The paranoia was already present prior to starting it. The paranoia became  a little bit worse approximately 3-4 months after starting the drug, then it stabilized and got better. After two years (just before I quit it) the paranoia increased slightly. 

Unfortunately for me, quitting the drug made no difference for me in terms of paranoia, it didn't lead to a reduction in paranoia. On the contrary it stayed the same and gradually worsened over time. As of this moment my paranoia is worse (a year after I stopped the drug) than it has ever been. 

The paranoia doesn't affect my life and functionality too much due to the fact that my paranoia is currently solely focused on my brother, whom I've decided to avoid since I have always found him a bit insensitive and gloomy anyways. My paranoid thoughts mostly revolve around fear of poisoning, sabotage, manipulation, stealing, gaslighting, and triangulation. There's usually a triggering event (f.ex that I've lost an item, that something unexpected happens, or that someone says something I believe is incorrect) and they are (almost always) of a non-magical/bizarre nature.

I was thinking of trying to work on the paranoia with self-help books and/or self help groups or courses. 

I've seen a therapist about my paranoia, but she didn't help at all unfortunately. She just said that she didn't think I was psychotic and discharged me without any treatment. I wasn't asking for medication, I was open for any treatment. The experience was somewhat traumatic for me, so I'm a little bit hesitant of trying talk therapy in my country again.

I took Pylera, finished the treatment, and did a follow-up endoscopy and biopsy in 2019. The result said the h. pylori was gone, no ulcers or anything, just mild inflammation. The doctor said it was nothing to worry about. Since then, I never had another positive test. I’ve also never vomited — not even during the worst of it.

But here’s the thing. It’s now 2025. That’s six full years. And I still don’t feel right. Not sick exactly, but not normal either.

I still burp way more than a normal person, every day, especially if I bike or do anything physical. every night a wake up with what feels like a sore stomach, not painful, just like pressure or discomfort that only goes away when I sip water. I get nausea when I nap after lunch, especially if I lie on my back. It wakes me up and feels awful, but I never actually throw up. Sometimes I get a tight chest or a weird “air bubble” feeling in my throat that makes me want to clear it constantly — that can last for weeks.

I eat normally. I digest heavy meals. I’ve gained weight. I drink coffee in the morning and eat bread, dairy, meat — all fine. Garlic and spicy stuff makes me worse, but not right away — it usually hits me *at night* when I’m trying to sleep.

No acid in the throat. No regurgitation. No vomit. Just this ongoing, annoying fake sickness (burps , constent air bubble in throat , waking up at night with sore stomach sometime nausea that goes with either burping or water ,if sever ice in neck) that never escalates but never fully leaves.

I’ve read about functional dyspepsia and vagus nerve stuff, and honestly, it fits. I even ran it all by ChatGPT and it made more sense than anything I’ve heard from doctors. But I still have that doubt in the back of my head — what if something’s lingering?

Hey, I’m Mia! I’m “Gold Verified” in this sub and here for something real. Fun fact about me? I don’t use chatgbt or some other ai bot to write my posts for me 🤣 

Im looking to offer a genuine girlfriend experience, focused on authentic connection..not just a surface level, transactional thing. I’m not here to play a role or put on a show. I’m 100% myself at all times, what you see is what you get with me! I value real chemistry and conversations that actually mean something. For me, this isn’t about just going through the motions. Im looking for some laugh with! Like, really laugh. The kind of laugh that makes your stomach hurt and has you spitting out your coffee 😆. That kind of connection is what I’m about … frequent, effortless, and full of joy ♥️ 

Let’s be honestt, “spicy” content is everywhere, and most of it’s free to look at. What I’m looking for is something you can’t just scroll and find .. real companionship anddd intimacy. That’s the real luxury. I’m looking for someone who gets that, who’s more interested in connection.

Outside of reddit, I live a full, vibrant life. I’m career driven, but in my free time you’ll find me enjoying Italian dinners with family, hiking with my dogs, soaking up the summer sun at the beach, binge watching a good series or crime show, or curled up in oversized sweats reading a book or working on my novel. I thrive on good vibes, spontaneous plans, and heart to hearts.

If you’re extroverted like me or more on the quiet side, I click best with people who are genuine and emotionally available! At the end of the day, I’m grounded, low-drama, and bring something unique to the table. I pride myself on being real…no games, no pretense, just me.

If you’ve read this far, chances are you’re exactly the kind of person I’d love to connect with. Curious? You should be. 😏 Send me a message and let’s see where this goes.

Her small apartment was filled with mismatched teacups, faded books, and framed black-and-white photos she found at flea markets. But it wasn’t until she stumbled upon a pair of antique chairs at an estate sale that she decided to really lean into vintage furniture.

The chairs were beautiful—solid wood frames with intricate carvings on the legs and arms, and upholstery in a delicate floral print that reminded her of her grandmother’s house. She didn’t think twice. The seller said they were from the early 1900s, still in decent condition. She paid in cash, borrowed her friend’s SUV, and brought them home that same day.

At first, the chairs sat in her living room like works of art. Visitors would comment on them, always with some variation of, “Wow, these are gorgeous. Are they comfortable?” Maggie would smile and say she hadn’t really used them yet.

It wasn’t until a rainy Sunday afternoon that she decided to test them out. She made tea, grabbed her book, and curled up in one of the chairs. Or, tried to. Right away, she noticed the seat was quite firm—bordering on hard—and the angle of the backrest pushed her shoulders slightly forward. After twenty minutes of shifting around and trying to get comfortable, she gave up and moved to her couch.

Still, she didn’t want to give up on the chairs. Maggie started researching online—forums, YouTube videos, even Reddit threads from other vintage furniture fans. She found out that a lot of antique chairs were built for different postures than what we’re used to today. Back then, people tended to sit more upright, and chairs were made to reflect that. Comfort wasn’t the priority—durability, style, and posture were.

Some users had similar complaints, but others suggested ways to make them more livable: custom seat cushions, adding lumbar support, or even getting them reupholstered with modern foam padding. Maggie liked the idea of preserving their look while making them practical.

She ended up having seat cushions made in a fabric that matched the room, with dense memory foam inside. It made a surprising difference. The chairs still weren’t the kind you’d lounge in for hours watching Netflix, but they became great for guests or for reading short chapters with a cup of coffee. And they looked just as beautiful.

In the end, Maggie learned that antique chairs often aren’t comfortable in the modern sense—but they can be, with a little effort. For her, it was worth it. They added charm and character to her home, and with a few small tweaks, they earned their place not just as decoration, but as actual furniture she used and enjoyed.",1,1748089974.0,ComfyChairs,0,1.0,False

So... I'm fairly sure espresso is 30ml of strong black coffee from the machine (as opposed to ristretto which is around 22ml). And while you could in theory, maybe order 7 shots of espresso in one cup(210ml), you  can't have latte with  6 shots of espresso (IT WOUD NOT BE LATTE ANY MORE!!!(latte has normally 3:1 or 5:1 milk to coffee proportions(done with single/double espresso) so the coffee would 840ml or 1260ml, and that's impossible)), and you sure as hell can't order 17 shots of espresso (510ml) with add ons such as milk, carmel etc.

I once calculated one of the more absurd coffee orders and ended up with around 3 litres of coffee

At some point i thought that there was single or double espresso shot and the rest was made up by equivalent amount of caffeine powder but that seems far fetched.

Do those people never order coffee, or what? (or maybe you can do that in the US) Or not know that espresso is a volume of specific coffee not standardized amount of caffeine (it can vary in espresso depending on beans etc.)?

For the past 4 years. we have had a Gaggia Naviglio and drink maybe 6-10 americanos a day. The family find it easy to use, but I find it a little weak, it’s good, but no comparison to a decent coffee shop. Maybe I am thinking about it wrong, but I put it down to the small puck size at around 10-11g, so if I were to look for a 2:1 ratio espresso I would be looking at only 20-25g of coffee coming out. This is impractical so instead I am extracting about 90g and topping up from there. Seems to be a reasonable compromise between over extraction and strength.

To improve on this I was considering moving to a semi-auto, either a Sage Barista Express Impress or a Ninja Cafe Luxe, but both will have a bit of a learning curve for the family who like the 1-press and done with the Gaggia. So this got me thinking about the Delonghi Magnifica Plus as it seems to have a more normal maximum puck of 18g so will produce a decent sized espresso.

Question in my mind is whether or not I will notice an improvement justifying the cost of the Magnifica Plus over the current Gaggia, or whether the next step up really needs to be a semi-automatic and just bite the bullet with teaching the family how to use and take care of it. All of these machines are of a similar budget (about £550-£750 in the UK) so I can’t even use that to decide.

Also not really sure why the puck size seems to be something that is not discussed in super-auto world. Finding specs for each machine is very hard making me wonder how important it is.

1kuagpi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kuagpi,Two Artists this Saturday,"Sometimes, the most captivating photography emerges from the perspective of someone familiar with a subject but approaching it with fresh eyes. This is precisely the case with the two photographers who will be exhibiting at the PEEP Photographer’s Collaborative on Saturday. Del Humberson, who will be showcasing his work from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., gives local subjects a whole new spin. Jerry Perez, who will be presenting his work from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., redefines nature and avian photography and is one of the best in the area. These two photographers are not only skilled photographers but also passionate about sharing their knowledge and insights about the subjects they capture. Come by and pick their brains, or simply grab an iced latte at the Podium Finish Coffee bar and browse the works of 18 of El Paso’s finest photographers.

As an added bonus, both photographers are offering special deals that would make fantastic Father’s Day gifts! Don’t miss out on this great opportunity to meet two of El Paso’s most innovative photographic artists and take home a beautiful piece of art at a bargain price.

The Collaborative is located at the Podium Finish Bicycle Cafe, 1400 Texas Avenue, Suite E.",1,1748089733.0,ElPasoArt,0,0.66,False
1kuafqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1kuafqi/roadmap/,Roadmap,"Roadmap is a series of poems. Each one represents one of the 7 trips that I took with my fiancee over the course of our time together. The eighth poem recalls some time we spent together earlier this week.

The titles represent the location and date of each trip.

**Roadmap**

\_\_\_\_\_

**Terlingua – January 15**

The sun was just waking up.  
And you thought I was sleeping.  
Wrapped tight in your blanket  
you clung to your coffee like hope.  
I watched you play with birds.

You crept behind cover like you wouldn’t be seen.  
They kept you a bush away,  
close enough to keep you chasing.  
So you did.

In that moment I saw you for you.  
Before I knew your depths.  
That morning I knew I would love you.

**Salt Flat – February 23**

We drove all day,  
but it felt like an instant.  
We talked about everything—nothing.  
Subtle glances,  
grazing touches.  
Our comfort told us we were onto something.  
Neither of us had to say it.

When we got to our camp the sky was on fire.  
We knew it was performing.  
Mirroring what it saw in us  
like we put it there ourselves.  
We hadn’t said it yet,  
but our eyes knew the words.

**Santa Rosa Beach – May 4**

Handshakes and smiles.  
Talking about my job.  
Four generations together.  
My first time meeting most of them.  
My time to shine.

But really,  
seeing your role, your peace, your glow.  
Daughter, sister, mother, rock.  
Watching your smile fill the room.  
Your warmth filled my heart.

The three of us shared a room that night.  
We made love while >!NAME\*!< slept.  
Quiet, but on fire.  
I held you so tight.  
You always fit like you were made for me.  
You surrendered.

It made us stronger.

**Gila Hot Springs – May 26**

Who gets this far away just to run and look at stars with someone they love?

What do we see here that we don’t see at home?

I see you.  
At peace. Decompressed.  
Curious. Soft.  
Your touches, your words,  
I’m in awe of your poise.

Are we finding our stride?  
Is this comfort safe?

We share the same love,  
for each other, in life.  
We don’t take it for granted.  
Like air or a date circled on the calendar,  
we don’t have to talk about it,  
but we know it’s there.

In this moment our time is eternal.

**Cuchara – July 4**

Our first two bedroom cabin.  
Our first family trip.

Taking turns.  
Building trust.

Walkie talkies, shoulder rides, and bears.  
Stomach born laughter.

She was perfect.  
And you were happy.

Our corner of heaven,  
It was all we needed.

**Crestone – October 12**

Just meet me in the middle.  
I’m waiting.  
Vulnerable. Exposed.

I’ve built my house on your cliffs,  
but I don’t fear the waves.  
I’ve heard the softness of your voice.

I’d let you tear me apart,  
but I know you won’t,  
I’ve felt the softness of your touch.

Let me tear you apart,  
you know I won’t.  
Trust the strength of my love.

**Jemez Springs – February 14**

We ran through the mountains together.  
Not for the first time,  
but I never thought it would be our last.

7,000’.  
It was snowing, we didn’t hesitate.  
We never did when it came to running.

Later I asked for your hand,  
and told you I’d give you my life  
if you just said yes.

(I thought) the answer came easy.  
Things always did if we didn’t fight it.  
“It shouldn’t be this hard.”

Now I look back at this trip,  
and I can’t remember the details.  
Am I protecting myself or are you already a fading memory?

**Home Depot Parking Lot – May 20**

I was five minutes early.  
You were ten minutes late.

You used to tell me I overthink things,  
but I know it means something this time.

We both had our notes ready.  
The first ones we’ve written that weren’t about our love.

Yours was polished and folded neatly.  
You always focused on the small details.

I know mine was messy.  
Why does my writing always get worse at the bottom of the page?

Before I left my house that morning I read the one where you wrote that I was the love of your life.  
Are you still breathing?

It’s hard being the one that’s left behind.  
Am I supposed to feel like a child?

I almost ran back to my car after you gave me the ring.  
Didn’t it fit right? Didn’t you like the way it shined?

You were supposed to wear it forever.  
Now it's just a memory.",1,1748089640.0,OCPoetry,1,1.0,False
1kuafpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1kuafpd/44_m4f_gmt2_lebanon_looking_for_a_relationship/,44 [M4F] GMT+2 Lebanon. Looking for a relationship with a future.,"hi. I'm 44, an engineer, and single. I don't have children. I haven't had luck locally and it's tough. I'm  physically fit and somewhat muscular except for my face which shows age. I've done nothing but work for the last 20 years. I dress very well. I have a stable job and a history of relatively large work projects.

I love coffee, 80s and 90s music, and walking. I also enjoy reading. I'm also a muslim.

I won't beat around the bush. I'm looking for a lady 30+ for a long term relationship with a future. A future means eventual marriage. I don't care for your nationality as long as you are residing in Lebanon. Bonus points if you are someone with a strong personality. I find ""intense"" to be an attractive quality.

1kuaea4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kuaea4,Junys Bakehouse,"A sweet storm is brewing in South Bangalore!  This up-and-coming patisserie is whipping up creations that are already raising the bar.  With mentions of their incredible pastries spreading like wildfire, Its already hard to get a table on weekends and its only worsening.  And get this - they're surrounded by a whole crew of friends opening up their own spots nearby. 

What started as a take away delivery place has just blossomed into a cute and cozy sitout when you can manage to grab a seat - otherwise its still a buzzing takeaway place 

My personal favorites are the gojuchang bun, strawberry verbana , strawberry spritz , 

Coffee is from riverside coffe, Coorg

The old bars were narrow, straight and about 15cm above the top tube. Unfortunately the bike is a little small for me so they felt very close and low. Problem is I can’t find any bars or vintage looking stems that would increase the reach and the height. I was thinking a moustache bar with a nitto stem but they’re not available to order anywhere I looked (I’m in Europe). 

I just got the ergotec moon cruiser bars but I don’t like them at all, so I’m returning them. They are huge, too wide and they decrease the reach. Any ideas? I feel like drop bars would be the most comfortable, hand position and reach wise, but it’s not a drop bar bike and I don’t really want to do that conversion.

A man walked slowly through it all, his back to the world, drifting more than moving, aimless yet tethered to some unseen thread.

He turned a corner and paused. An alleyway  familiar, though not from this life. Unlike the rest of the city, it shimmered faintly, strangely luxurious. Soft golden light spilled from tucked-away lamps, glinting off polished bricks and gentle shadows. Curious, he wandered in.

The deeper he walked, the more it felt like a dream he had once forgotten. Familiar. Foreign. A déjà vu soaked in static.

He munched on something from his coat pocket an old dog treat, the kind his mother used to buy for their family dog. Why he was eating it now, he couldn’t say. Maybe it reminded him of home. Maybe it was just what he had.

Just ahead, a girl sat on the curb, nibbling on a cookie shaped like a dog bone. She looked up, briefly, and smiled without judgment. He gave a nod, a silent thanks. Maybe I’m not that weird after all, he thought.

He continued.

Outside a tiny coffee shop, barely bigger than a stall, he saw a toy Dalmatian without any spots. It played with a stone and a rubber bone, repeating the same pattern like a wind-up toy that never lost steam. Small metal chairs and tables sat empty, delicate and out of place in the alley’s hush.

He took a seat. Watched. The toy dog kept playing, over and over 
stone, bone, stone, bone.

Minutes passed. Or more.

A voice broke the loop. “You’re in my seat,” said a man holding a coffee cup and a slice of some glossy dessert.

“Oh. Sorry.” He stood quickly, brushing crumbs from his coat.

As he stepped aside, he noticed a larger coffee cup sitting just below his table, almost hidden in the shadows. The man grabbed it and, with smooth ease, placed it on his own table. Then, before walking away, he said, “You don’t belong here. Go back to where you came from.”

The words stung. A sharp, hollow cut. The man clenched his fists, trying to summon something to say anything. But all he could muster was a barked, clumsy insult as the other man sat down, unfolded a newspaper, and sipped his coffee without another glance.

He kept walking.

Before turning the corner, he looked back. The toy dog still played its endless game. The man still sipped and read.

Nothing had changed.
