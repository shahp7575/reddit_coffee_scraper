1lmcmzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/1lmcmzp/first_miscarriage_at_work/,First miscarriage at work,"I’m positing again. 
I know I’m experiencing a miscarriage. I was suppose to be 8 weeks but measuring 6+2 with no heart beat. This was confirmed 1.5 weeks ago. I started bleeding a little last Wednesday and it has been constant up until today. 

I’m at work and had a wave of pressure in my pelvis well my vagina and cramps, and I also felt pressure in my butt like I needed to poop nothing unbearable as I was still serving customers and making coffees but I could feel it. Sorry this is so TMI.

Took about 20 minutes before I was able to go to the toilet. I went to the toilet and the bowl was red with blood and 2 50 cent size clots in the toilet. I was not fishing it out as I am at work and I’d prefer not to see. Before this it was just when I would wipe mostly and some on a pad and the clots were like little coffee grounds.

I am aware that this may not be the end but it is the most I have felt anything all week. I’m not bleeding as much now and the pain has gone away. Does anyone have any other experiences? And I can’t go home as I can’t afford not to work. 

I have always been pretty natural I don’t even take Panadol for things when I’m in pain I normally just ride it out. I did take ponstan this morning for the cramps. ",1,1751080067.0,Miscarriage,0,1.0,False

i wish someone would euthanize me. this is why i stay inside all day. so i can pretend like i pass by posting on the selfie sub. I tried voice training a few hours after i landed and I just started sobbing again because i got reminded that i‘ll always be a testosterone poisoned monster and earlier on the plane I made such an effort to not say a single word… :/ 

then I had to go to a family dinner and my grandma was telling me how much she disliked my threaded eyebrows and my haircut and the way i was sitting crosslegged. half of the things she said were just shitting on my appearance. then i left her house for a few moments and when i came back she placed this anti-trans children’s book on the coffee table intentionally so i would see it. she doesn’t know im trans but now ik she obviously suspects it.

1lmclu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1lmclu8/where_she_went_wrong/,Where She Went Wrong,"This story will have two parts Evie’s side and her best friend Lena’s point of view 

“Where She Went Wrong”

The sun spilled through the curtains like it had the day before, soft and golden and cruel. Evie blinked into it, letting the warmth touch her face like a quiet reminder: You’re still here.
She rolled over, phone already in hand. No new texts.
She wasn’t sure when it had started the ache, the silence inside her, the weight pressing against her ribs like someone was sitting on her chest while the world just... went on. But she did know why she stayed.
Lena.
Lena with the wild laugh, who once said, “If you die, I’ll haunt you just to yell at you.” Lena who saw her on the days she didn’t want to be seen. Who once found her on the bathroom floor, barely breathing, and sat beside her for hours, saying nothing just being there.
Evie had written hundreds of notes she never sent. Apologies. Explanations. Confessions. But each time she imagined Lena reading them, she saw her best friend falling apart. Saw her screaming into the wind. Ripping herself to pieces wondering what signs she’d missed. Wondering how she could’ve saved her.
So Evie stayed alive.
For her.
She smiled through dinners. Took the photos. Laughed at things that weren’t funny. She stitched herself together with Lena’s love like it was enough to make her whole. But it wasn’t.
She wanted to be okay. God, she tried.
One night, they lay under the stars on Lena’s roof, a blanket thrown over the shingles, and Lena whispered, “Promise me something?”
Evie turned her head, their fingers brushing. “Anything.”
“If you ever feel like... like you're slipping, tell me. Don't go quiet on me. Don’t go where I can’t follow.”
Evie swallowed the lump in her throat. “I promise.”
But some promises aren’t loud when they break. Some fall like glass silent and glittering in the dark.

It was a cold October morning when Lena found the final note. Short. Almost cruel in its simplicity.
I held on as long as I could. I swear. But please know this was never your fault. You gave me extra years. I just couldn’t find a way to give myself forever.
Please don’t try to figure out where you went wrong.
Lena reread that line a thousand times. Then a thousand more. And still every day after she did exactly what Evie asked her not to.

She searched for the wrong moment. The wrong word. The day she missed it. The day she should’ve hugged her longer. Should’ve said, “I love you” more often. Should’ve fought harder. Should’ve been more.

She became a ghost of herself, chasing shadows of Evie’s smile.
Because staying alive for someone is noble.
But dying despite their love?
That’s the kind of pain that writes itself into your bones and never leaves.
And Lena?She was never the same again.

“The Day I Couldn’t Save Her”

Lena’s Point of View

I still hear her laugh sometimes.

In dreams. In quiet places. In the moments I forget she’s gone.

Evie. My best friend. My other half. The one person who saw all the dark corners of me and never flinched. I loved her like something sacred. Not in a romantic way, though maybe once I thought it could’ve been. No this love was deeper. Fierce. Protective. Like she was the part of me I never got to grow myself.

She told me once, in that quiet, broken voice she used when she was trying not to fall apart, “I’m only still here because of you. You’d lose your mind if I disappeared.”

I laughed. I said something stupid like, “Damn right I would.”
But what I should’ve said was, You’re not allowed to ever think like that again.

I didn’t know how close she was to the edge. She smiled through everything, even on the worst days. She sent me memes. She asked me if I wanted coffee. She told me about some stupid bird that flew into her window. She made me feel better when she was the one carrying the storm.

I saw her pain but I thought I was helping her carry it.

I thought she was safe.

The last time I saw her, she hugged me tighter than usual. Said, “Thank you for everything.”
I didn’t realize that was a goodbye.

I found the note two days later.

I held on as long as I could. I swear. But please know this was never your fault. You gave me extra years. I just couldn’t find a way to give myself forever.
Please don’t try to figure out where you went wrong.
But how could I not?

How could I not wonder if I missed something? If I wasn’t loud enough with my love? If I should’ve gone to her house that night? If I should’ve broken down the door and screamed until she believed she was worth staying?

I have replayed that week, that month, that whole fucking year, over and over. Looking for the crack in the wall I didn’t seal. The day she slipped through my fingers.

She says it wasn’t my fault.

But it feels like it is.

Because if I had meant enough if I had done enough maybe she’d still be here.

I think about her every day. I wear her ring on a chain around my neck. I can’t listen to her favorite songs. I can’t go back to the coffee shop we loved. I talk to her sometimes, out loud. Just in case she’s still listening.

And I ask her the same question every time:

Why didn’t you let me hold you tighter?

This lifestyle news roundup synthesizes information from various sources, offering a glimpse into the trends, health advice, and cultural events impacting individuals on June 28, 2025. From fashion and beauty to health and career advice, the following covers a wide range of topics relevant to modern living.

**Health and Wellness:**

The health sector sees a mix of advancements, warnings, and practical advice. A significant concern highlighted in a recent study is the potential health risks associated with disposable vapes. Researchers from the University of California, Davis, found that certain disposable e-cigarette models release concerning levels of toxic metals, including lead, nickel, and antimony. Alarmingly, some devices emitted more lead during a single day's use than the equivalent of nearly 20 packs of traditional cigarettes. This has led to calls for stricter regulation of the disposable vape market, particularly given its popularity among young adults.

Complementing this cautionary tale, insights from the medical field continue to emerge. A neurologist offers a checklist for safe travel, and new studies are examining the impact of exercise on weight loss. The nuances of high vs. low-calorie burning exercises are discussed, with the recommendation for a balanced and sustainable workout routine. Additionally, the report highlights the potential of consuming coffee without sugar or cream to potentially lower risk of death by 14 percent. Furthermore, a report by the World Health Organisation states that tobacco control efforts are protecting 6.1 billion people.

Beyond physical health, the discussion also addresses mental well-being. It emphasizes lifestyle adjustments during the early years of life, highlighting the importance of overall health correction. The role of a healthy diet is highlighted, including the suggestion that ""shuffling food leads to better blood sugar regulation"" and the potential health benefits of jamun seeds. The content provides insights into various medical conditions, including aneurysms, AVMs, and trigeminal neuralgia, highlighting the importance of consulting a doctor when necessary.

**Career & Technology:**

The ever-evolving landscape of job searching and professional development is highlighted with a focus on leveraging technology. ChatGPT continues to be a powerful tool for professionals and students worldwide, with its capabilities extending beyond text generation. It is now utilized for resume enhancement, creating visually appealing images, and even voice capabilities, with the potential to become an invaluable asset for job seekers. The article suggests numerous ways one can use ChatGPT to enhance careers, offering potential career advancements by utilizing the software.

**Fashion & Beauty:**

Fashion continues to be a focal point, with coverage of celebrity styles, product launches, and the ongoing influence of trends. The best looks of the week feature Simone Ashley and Sonam Kapoor Ahuja, known for their structured and elegant looks. Other celebrities mentioned as influencing style trends include Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Ananya Panday, and Sydney Sweeney.

The beauty sector is bustling with new launches. June sees a rehaul of beauty routines, with a need for new summer perfumes and makeup. A curated selection of the best new beauty products for June offers options for every category. The article also reports on Amal Clooney, who sourced a gown from the 16Arlington Autumn/Winter 2025 collection, which is thriving in London. Other fashion trends for the season include Rihanna’s updo, Dakota Johnson, Rihanna, and Hailey Bieber’s go-to basics, and a range of under-$500 options.

**Cultural & Lifestyle:**

A look into the lifestyle and cultural practices reveals some interesting insights. One of the key findings is the traditional practice of ""cricket teas"" in Yorkshire, England. These teas, hosted by ‘tea ladies’, provide a sense of community through a spread of sandwiches, cakes, scones, and, of course, tea.

In the world of entertainment, the article highlights the trend of hairstyles worn by Rihanna, noting that she combines three trendy summer hair trends into one gorgeous look.

In addition to these articles, the India Today News highlights Lifestyle news in its section.

**Horoscopes:**

For those interested in astrology, the day's horoscopes are also available: Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn, Sagittarius, Scorpio, and Libra all offer insights into the potential for the day.

This has been torturing me for almost 3 years, it just doesn't make sense. 
So I have 2 older sisters. I'm 46 and have a boyfriend, b married and c divorced. 
I am a flirt, I'll admit it. I'm also Mexican and my family is way too conservative and traditional. 
So my boyfriend is a widower. His mom and my mom are best friends and have known each other about 40 years. 
3 years ago he was helping my mom with the remodeling of the house (I live with my parents). I offered him an iced coffee. Our eyes met across the room and I could feel the sparks. About 2 weeks later I had to pick up a couple of bookshelves from a friend's house and he happened to own a truck. So I called him and asked him for a ride. He asked me if we would meet there or if I was riding in the truck with him, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to be with him one on one!
We talked about everything! I had gotten his phone number from my mom and after that day he started calling me and we started going out. He kept calling me and asking me out, always picking me up.
Well, sister b and mom became very upset when they figured out we were dating and claimed I was throwing myself at him. That I was shameless somehow. 
He's a widower. His wife had passed months before we started dating (5, almost 6).
Now, sister b, who has been married 28 years (29 in September), had told my mom my boyfriend had 'looked funny' at her about 10 years ago (when his wife was still alive and had cancer). She claimed that meant he made a pass at her, even though he never said anything inappropriate and stayed with his wife until she passed away from cancer. He's a roofing contractor. He saw her once on top of the roof when he made the alleged pass, then he called to give the quote and never contacted her again. The next time she saw him was when he was dating me.
She claims to dislike him because he is so much older than me (16 years) but I think she may feel I somehow took him from her.

i cant even do things i wanna do like ive been saying im gonna redo/paint my nails for weeks now, coloring/other art projects, reading, organizing (its usually fun for me lol), etc. whenever im outside of the apartment, i used to like just walking around stores shopping/thrifting, going to a cute lil coffee shop, going to the beach/pool, etc and lately like none of that interests me. my brain is just like meh lets just go home and lay on the couch 

i barely eat too because nothing sounds appetizing and whenever i do eat anything bc i know i have to, it usually doesnt “hit” like i want it to which just makes me not wanna eat even more lol i feel like this may be a big part of everything and maybe i need to try and find certain foods i can tolerate that also will give me energy? 

i usually always go thru different phases of being more and less motivated to do more things/be productive but it doesnt usually feel this bad or for this long. i ended a previous job that had crazy long hours and started a new one beginning of june i was excited for to have more free time and have plenty of time to balance being productive and relaxing but i literally just spend every minute on the couch (or laying in bed) any advice is welcome!!!

1lmcdcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Afraid_Blackberry664/comments/1lmcdcs/balance_in_the_chaos_wellness_tips_every_mom/,Balance in the Chaos: Wellness Tips Every Mom Deserves to Know,"

Let’s face it: motherhood is beautiful, but it’s also relentless. From packing lunches and chasing toddlers to managing school schedules, remote work, and mental load, moms are the CEOs of their households—minus the paid vacation and catered lunches.

But while modern motherhood demands near-superhuman effort, moms are still human. And that means mental, physical, and emotional well-being aren’t optional luxuries—they’re essential tools for survival. If you've been running on caffeine, leftovers, and sheer willpower, it might be time to shift gears and refocus on something you probably haven’t prioritized in a while: *you*.

Here are eight powerful wellness tips for moms to help you feel more balanced, energized, and genuinely well—without adding more stress to your plate.

**1. Start With 10 Minutes—Not an Hour**

When you think of “self-care,” what comes to mind? A two-hour bubble bath? A yoga retreat? While those sound lovely, the truth is, most moms don’t have the luxury of long, uninterrupted breaks.

But that doesn’t mean you don’t deserve care.

Start with just 10 minutes a day—before the house wakes up, while the kids nap, or even in your car in the school pick-up line. Use that time to journal, stretch, breathe, or sip tea without distraction. Over time, those small moments add up and signal to your nervous system: *you matter, too*.

**2. Nourish Without Guilt**

Many moms fall into the habit of finishing their kids’ plates or grabbing quick bites while multitasking. But nutrition isn’t just about keeping your body running—it affects mood, sleep, immunity, and long-term health.

Instead of following restrictive diets or trying to “snap back,” focus on nourishment. That means colorful fruits and veggies, healthy fats, water, and regular meals—especially breakfast. And yes, that includes carbs. Your brain needs fuel, mama.

**3. Move in a Way That Feels Good**

Forget punishment workouts or bouncing back post-baby. Movement should be joyful, empowering, and realistic.

Can’t get to the gym? Dance in your kitchen. Go on stroller walks. Do yoga stretches while the kids play on the floor. Short bursts of activity release endorphins, improve sleep, and help regulate stress—even if you only have 15 minutes.

Consistency matters more than intensity. It’s not about the perfect body—it’s about building strength and energy to meet your daily demands.

**4. Create Boundaries Like a Boss**

If your to-do list never ends and “no” isn’t in your vocabulary, burnout is just around the corner.

Setting boundaries isn’t selfish—it’s essential wellness. That might mean carving out solo time after bedtime routines, saying no to one more PTA responsibility, or designating Sundays as “no plans” days.

When you protect your energy, you show your family what self-respect looks like. And believe it or not—they’ll benefit, too.

**5. Ask for (and Accept) Help**

One of the hardest things for many moms to do? Admit they need support. But you don’t win any prizes for doing it all alone.

Let your partner take over dinner or bath time. Trade babysitting with a neighbor. Say yes when a friend offers to drop off groceries. Your village is there—if you allow them in.

Asking for help is not weakness—it’s wisdom. And it sets a powerful example for your kids.

**6. Prioritize Mental Health Without Shame**

Maternal mental health is still too often dismissed or minimized. But postpartum depression, anxiety, and burnout are real—and treatable.

Even if you’re not struggling with a clinical diagnosis, emotional fatigue is common. Talking to a therapist, joining a support group, or even journaling can be powerful tools for clarity and healing.

If your cup is empty, you can’t pour into others. Tending to your emotional well-being isn’t optional—it’s vital.

**7. Redefine “Me Time”**

You don’t need an entire spa day to feel refreshed (although we won’t argue if you get one). “Me time” can be micro-moments: listening to a podcast in the car, reading a chapter of a book before bed, or simply walking alone with your thoughts.

The key is intentionality. Whatever makes you feel *you*—do more of that.

**8. Connect With Other Moms Who** ***Get It***

Motherhood can feel isolating, even in a full house. That’s why community matters so much. Talking with other moms who understand your challenges—whether in person or online—can be healing.

You’re not the only one reheating coffee four times a day. You’re not the only one who cries from exhaustion or feels guilty for craving space. Connection reminds us we’re not alone—and that we don’t have to be.

**A Healthier Mom Is a Happier Home**

The truth is, wellness looks different in every season of motherhood. Sometimes it’s a nap. Sometimes it’s a meal eaten sitting down. Sometimes it’s asking your partner to take over while you walk around the block with a podcast and your sanity.

Whatever wellness means for you, it starts with one simple mindset shift: *You are worth caring for, too.*

Because when you feel better, *everyone* in your orbit benefits—and that’s something every mom deserves.",1,1751079193.0,u_Afraid_Blackberry664,0,1.0,False
1lmcd49,https://www.reddit.com/r/SacramentoFriends/comments/1lmcd49/37m_midtowner_looking_for_new_friends/,37M – Midtowner Looking for New Friends,"Hey r/SacramentoFriends – I’m a 37-year-old straight guy living in Midtown, looking to meet some new people who actually enjoy getting out and doing stuff. Most of my longtime friends have either moved away or turned into couch furniture, and I’d much rather be out exploring the city than watching another episode of something I’ve already seen.

About me:
I work in construction management and grew up here in Sacramento. I’ve also spent time living in New Orleans and Hawaii before making my way back home. Now I’m hoping to rebuild my local social circle with people who are down for a good time, good conversation, and trying new things.

Stuff I’m into:

Working out - but usually prefer solo. I try to be in and out of the gym as quick as I can while still completing my routine.

Live music (bonus points if it's outdoors with a cold drink in hand). Last show I went to was Ajunadeep at the barn.

Bars, breweries, and festivals.

Coffee shops with a chill vibe — I'm there often, usually pretending to be productive.

Hanging out at the river when it’s hot out.

Hiking, travel, and spontaneous weekend adventures — heading to Canada in a week and Iceland in a couple months.

Kayaking (been plenty, always down to go again) and wanting to try stand-up paddleboarding.

Just got into snowboarding this year — didn’t die/break anything, had a blast, want more!

Cars — I own an Evo that I used to race; love talking builds, events, or going for drives.

Stock trading — I dabble, I gamble, I pretend it’s strategy 😅


Politically, I’d say I’m on the right side of left: open-minded and reasonable.

If you're also looking to meet someone to grab a drink with, catch a concert, hit the river or trails, or just chill with some solid conversation, shoot me a DM or drop a comment. Whether it’s one-on-one hangouts or tagging along to something going on, I’m up for it.

1lmc8c0,https://i.redd.it/05j0dyv10l9f1.jpeg,L1 Cleared. Sharing my Journey.,"[alert long post]

Hello! 

It is very good feeling once you see the results of your handwork. My journey started from Oct 2024 when I registered early bird for May 2025 exam. 

I studied Econ for 2 months and first few chapters of Equity until December. Didn’t studied a word till Feb third week then.

The real prep started around Feb 20, 3 months prior to the exam date - May 15. With no Finance background and core engineering background (bachelor’s and Masters), I started studying.

My strategy - Read LES, Solve that topic question instantly, solve practice pack questions of that topic instantly, move to new topic. At later stages I found if topic is too lengthy in LES and too complex, I watched Letmeexplain youtuber videos - I bought the membership. If you have the LES practice pack, you would know that you can solve questions of that topic of qbank and practice pack instantly. I used to make notes while reading - brief notes that helped me memorize because I was simply writing , yet I didn’t read them much later. This went on for easier subjects - Equity (2nd part which was left), Corp Issue, Derivative, Quant, and Alt Investment.

I work full time, so I studied 4 hours in eve - not every day but atleast 3 out 5 weekdays and 10 hours on weekends. This went on for 40 - 50 days. And I completed- Econ, Equity, Quant, Alt Investment, Corp Issuer, Derivatives - 6 smaller subjects.


Started hitting Ethics in April for first two weeks, then FSA which I couldn’t complete but somehow reached till Financial Lease, and completed half of FI, and did first 2 big chapters of portfolio management by 23rd April. 

I thought now its time to just give my First mock - and I scored 69%. Pretty positive - Mock A. I have made posts on Mock journey.

At around April 26- 27, I brought Schweser qbank. I started hitting questions left right and centre and balancing mocks and studying remaining parts of my syllabus half of FI and FSA last few chapters briefly from one of the prep providers notes. 

Some mocks gave me confidence, some didn’t - but I identified a pattern- If I did good revision of subjects one day prior to mock - I would score well in those subjects in mock. 

This made me realized, I have to have my brain stuffed up with info of all 10 subjects before exam. I knew 5 subjects that come in section 2 of exam and made critical choice on what to study in that 30 min gap.

Last 3 days were most critical, I studied and revised subjects of section 2 on 2 days before exam and never touched them until that 30 min gap in exam. I studied for section 1 subjects on day before exam.

Both days I hammered 200 schweser qbank questions and 1 mock a day to have a feel. 

And I did some mistake on the exam day - 15 May. only slept 45 min the night before as I was solving questions and I was the least focus I was ever. But for god’s grace we have enough time, I had a good coffee and went for the exam, section 1 happened and studied concise notes in 30 mins and section 2.

Results came yesterday and scored 1740 - first attempt. More than 70% on each subjects (I think I can say this without violating ethics .. lol) - Pic attached.

Things I learned 
- Starting little early - 4 months is always good.
- Completing Syllabus atleast 20 days prior- meaning marked Les topics read and solved all les + practice pack questions.
- Revision is not simple and reading new topics with revision is hell.
- Exam is structured in a way that you ll not feel confident, trust me its normal.
- Last one week is very important 
- Consistency is key, and even a single day miss wreck havoc - Daily for 4 months is key.
- Solving questions as you read topics is most important
- Mocks give you an idea on how much time you are spending, how do you feel when you attempt all 10 subjects together. Do not base your confidence on mock scores. Syllabus is so vast, there can be a paper in hypothetical world where all the questions are drafted from extreme corners of syllabus that you have shrugged upon saying ah ok, whats next and despite knowing everything you would fail this hypothetical paper. Use mocks to prepare exam style confidence- no overreliance on their results.
- Spending money on things are hard , like add ons - practice pack, membership of youtube channel I mentioned, schweser qbank, but those definitely add value - not endorsing these ones that I mentioned, but make your style and don’t hesitate in spending- focus should be on study.
- This can be optional, I had CFA charterholders (from my org.) as my mentors which kept my morale high and guided me. For example my mentor said to give mock on april 25 something and not delay more. My mentor said to start revising despite I was left to cover critical aspects of FI and FSA.

Sorry for long post, not adding TLDR, use chatgpt if you want. My dms open if you have any questions.

Delivering a luxury sushi order worth ¥99,999 on a stormy day—with an extra ¥100 tip—I was quietly thrilled.

But then I accidentally overheard laughter coming from inside the villa.

“She actually believes you were paralyzed in a car crash, and she delivers takeout every day to support you? She even sold her mother’s keepsake?”

“If she finds out you’re the Silvercrest Society's heir to the Reynolds fortune, worth billions of dollars, and you’re just playing the poor man’s game—wouldn’t she die of heartbreak?”

Jacob Reynolds swirled his wine glass lazily.

“A woman like that—cheap and born to serve others.”

“She used to outshine Sophia in school. Deceiving her now is the punishment she deserves.”

I stood in the rain, tears blended with the downpour.

So he faked being sick for two years—just to help his childhood sweetheart take revenge on me.

His paralyzed legs, his tragic orphan story, his helpless tears—All of it, carefully crafted lies.

In the end, I called the father I hadn’t spoken to in years.

“Dad, I lost. I agree to the engagement.”

After hanging up, Sophia Montgomery’s voice drifted out of the villa again.

“My sweet Jacob spoils and defends me, that’s why he taught that little tramp a lesson. I’m so happy.”

Her slender fingers hooked under Jacob’s chin.

And I saw the ring on her finger—my mother’s.

Jacob chuckled softly, gently biting her fingertip. “You naughty thing.”

I saw his supposedly paralyzed legs, casually crossed on the coffee table—completely functional.

The thick white cast that fooled me for over two years gleamed mockingly under the lights.

Clutching the delivery box, I knocked on the door.

Everyone inside turned their heads to look at me.

The once-lively living room fell deathly silent.

Step by step, I walked toward Jacob.

Each step left a distinct, wet footprint on the floor.

Jacob’s voice turned hoarse and tense, his eyes darting nervously. “Why are you here?”

“I was just... meeting some old classmates...” I ignored him. My eyes were fixed on the ring on Sophia’s finger.

“Give me back the ring.”

The smile on Jacob’s face froze. He hadn’t expected me to be this calm.

He instinctively wheeled toward me, trying to soothe me with that familiar gentle tone: “Emily, listen to me...”

“Listen to what?” I cut him off, my lips curling into a grimace that was uglier than crying.

“Tell me that you generously sold the ring to Miss Montgomery for a good price?”

“Or that your paralyzed legs just happened to be working today?”

Jacob’s face turned pale. He opened his mouth but said nothing.

The room grew heavier with silence.

Only Sophia let out a sneering laugh.

She stood with her hips swaying in her high heels, and came to stand before me, deliberately holding out her hand with the ring.

“This ring is a gift from Jacob. You like it? Want it back?”

She emphasized “a gift” with smug satisfaction in her eyes.

Jacob’s face twisted with guilt. “Sophia, stop! Emily, she—”

“She what?” Sophia cut him off impatiently, giving me a slow once-over—my soaked, cheap delivery uniform.

“You want it? Fine, for Jacob’s sake, I could give it back. But not at the original price. I’ve worn it already, after all. If I’m in a good mood, I’ll sell it to you at a ‘friendship price’— ¥500,000, cash. Pay now, and it’s yours.”

¥500,000?

After falling out with my father, I had nothing left. I’d pawned all my mother’s keepsakes to “treat” Jacob. I couldn’t even scrape together ¥500 now.

I looked at her gloating face, then at Jacob—who avoided my gaze, silently condoning her cruelty.

It felt like an icy hand had clenched my heart, crushing the last flicker of warmth I held for the past.

“Fine.”

“I’ll buy it.”

# Chapter 2

All I wanted was to get back the last thing my mother left me—and then never have anything to do with these people ever again.

“You’ll buy it?”

Sophia laughed as if she’d just heard the joke of the century, covering her mouth in exaggerated amusement.

Then she pointed at the insulated delivery box I was still holding—the ¥99,999 luxury sushi set.

“You couldn’t earn ¥500,000 even if you delivered takeout your whole life. Look at what you’re holding! Have you ever seen sushi this expensive? Have you ever tasted it? Do you even deserve to?”

Before I could react, she suddenly reached out, yanked the box from my hands, and hurled it to the ground.

BANG!

The wooden container slammed into the marble floor with a heavy thud.

The lid popped open, and the meticulously plated, priceless sushi spilled everywhere—sashimi, caviar, and wagyu beef scattered in disarray.

Sophia looked down at the mess and ground her high heel into a slice of precious bluefin tuna.

“See that? A ¥99,999 sushi meal. I throw it out whenever I want. But you—someone born into a life of poverty—you could never live so freely, could you?”

“You’ll never earn enough to eat food this high-end. You're only fit to smell it. That’s the difference between you and me, got it?”

Laughter and jeers erupted from the crowd.

“Yeah, seriously! A delivery girl daring to fight Miss Sophia over something?”

“She looks broke as hell. Wants to pay 500,000? Maybe if she seduces some old man at a retirement home!”

“Honestly, with that innocent look, she’s probably just the type rich old guys go for.”

Sophia basked in their mockery, her smug grin widening.

She looked at the ring on her finger, then back at my soaked, humiliated figure with a look of pure disdain.

“Jacob once told me this ring was supposedly some priceless thing. But judging by how poor you are, it’s probably just a piece of junk, huh?”

“You’re the only one who ever treated it like treasure.”

With that, she pinched the ring between her fingers.

Before anyone—including Jacob—could react, she yanked open the glass doors, raised her arm, and flung the ring outward.

It traced a glittering arc through the rain—And with a splash, it landed perfectly in the rushing waters of the Crystalbrook River beside the villa.

“No!”

My eyes widened in horror—that ring was the last memory of my mother!

My body moved before my mind could react.

Like someone possessed, I bolted toward the terrace and climbed over the railing, ready to leap into the freezing river below.

“Emily!”

Jacob shouted. In a split second, he stood up from his wheelchair!

The movement was fluid and agile—nothing like someone who had been “paralyzed” for two years.

In a flash, he ran forward and wrapped his arms around my waist, dragging me back from the edge.

“Let me go! Jacob! Let go of me!”

I struggled with all my strength, eyes locked on the river as the last glint of the ring was swallowed by the current.

Cold rain mixed with burning tears blurred my vision.

“Are you insane?! You’d risk your life for some damn ring?!”

Jacob’s voice was tinged with panic—but mostly impatience, as if I were the one being unreasonable.

Just a damn ring?

That was the only thing my mother left me.

And his beloved Sophia had just thrown it away like trash.

At that moment, all the rage, sorrow, and humiliation inside me turned into a chilling emptiness.

I stopped struggling.

My body went rigid in his arms, cold and lifeless.

“Let’s break up.”

My voice was calm—unnervingly calm.

# Chapter 3

Jacob’s body stiffened suddenly, then he let out a laugh like he’d just heard something ridiculous.

“Emily, stop it! I know you’re upset about the ring. I’ll have Sophia apologize! We can—”

“I’m not making a scene.”

I cut him off, prying his fingers from my waist one by one, forcefully.

Then I turned to face him—this face that now filled me with nothing but disgust.

“Jacob, haven’t you had enough of this performance of yours? Two years of pretending? I’ve lost my mother’s ring, and with it, every last bit of feeling I had for you. How long did you think you could keep playing me?”

His gaze flickered. That all-too-familiar expression—weak, helpless—reappeared on his face in an instant.

“Emily, what are you talking about? My legs really were injured. It’s just that I’ve made great progress through treatment. And now you’re just going to abandon me? So you have looked down on me all this time, haven’t you? You always wanted to leave me!”

He was doing it again—using his “disability” and fear of abandonment to emotionally manipulate me.

Watching his award-worthy performance, I found it all laughable.

I didn’t respond. I didn’t have the strength to say another word to him.

Silently, I bent down and picked up the delivery box—now filthy and empty—off the floor.

Without so much as a glance at him or the smug crowd on the terrace, I turned and walked away, step by step, into the pouring rain.

Behind me, Sophia’s honeyed voice rang out:

“Oh, come on, Jacob! So what if the truth’s out? You’re not actually upset about hurting that crazy woman, are you?”

“No way. You’re the heir to the Reynolds fortune, and you seriously fell for a takeout girl?”

I didn’t hear Jacob’s response.

It didn’t matter anymore.

Now that we’d broken up, I didn’t need to work deliveries anymore, either.

I called the station manager to resign.

He sounded shocked.

“Emily? What happened? You’ve been doing great—why quit all of a sudden? Don’t you still need money for your boyfriend’s treatment?”

“He’s fine now,” I said, forcing a smile. “Perfectly fine.”

“Oh! That’s great!”

The manager’s voice brimmed with relief. “After all he’s been through, he’s bound to treat you even better now. Things can only go up from here!”

Things can only go up?

I let out a bitter laugh, wordless.

Right—wasn’t it Jacob who got me into this grueling, rain-or-shine, humiliation-filled job in the first place?

He said it was to “share the burden.”

In truth, it was just so I’d suffer for Sophia’s revenge.

Good thing—it’s over now.

After packing all my belongings, I went the next day to the most luxurious hotel in the city.

Dragging my suitcase and bags, I stumbled into the grand lobby, soaked and disheveled.

I looked wildly out of place and instantly drew countless strange, judgmental stares.

“Well, well, who do we have here? Isn’t it our diligent little takeout queen—Emily?”

A shrill, mocking voice rang out behind me, one so familiar it made my stomach turn.

Sophia.

She was here—along with her pack of pampered parasites.

I didn’t stop. I just kept moving, dragging my luggage further inside.

But Sophia wasn’t about to let me go.

She and her entourage swarmed me like spectators at a zoo.

“Look who it is!”

Sophia pinched her nose dramatically, as if I reeked.

I have not used chatgpt for this post- these are my words (imperfect but mine). I work with so many doctors, MA's and others in the healthcare industry ( I work in a hopsital).

BTW I have not used chatGPT for this post ( but because I have used it alot in the past because Grammer is not my strongsuit- I used the format of chatGPT, so my entire post doesn't feel like a run-on sentence.

1. Working under (most) white women is the worst: I'm sorry but the white female managers that I have worked under are some of the rudest, most aggressive women I have ever met. They always target me and my other colleagues that are also WOC ( especially Black and Desi Indian women). White women will never have your back and always make it seem like you are never doing enough or you are lazy ( even if you are putting in your 100% into your job). My white female co-workers can get away with anything but I and other WOC are always put under a microscope and never given the benefit of the doubt. They will always see you as less than and treat you like second class citizens. I have also worked under non white WOC managers and they are not like this ( obviously there are exceptions cause I also had a horrible Indian female manager but it is usually rare).
2. Working with or under Brown Men ( millennial and gen Z men especially) is also the worst: From my experience it doesn't matter if the brown guys is above you in rank or equal or lower, they have always treated me and my other brown female coworkers really poorly. Most of them will treat me exactly how the white women would treat me, almost like I am a second class citizen. Also I get the feeling that anytime I try to have a friendly conversation with them, they ignore me, give me one word answers and are mean or start thinking I like them or something. Also those same brown men will treat other non brown women the complete opposite, that even if I complain to my managers, they think I am making it up or no one believes me.

I used to work at an Urgent Care as a MA during PT school and the Doctor that I was working with ( he was from India and in his late 40's) and he would literally scream at me and the other brown and black coworkers, while giving me orders vs being so nice to my white female coworkers and buying them lunch and making sure that they ""eat lunch"" or telling them ""make sure your eat"" while not even giving two flips about me or my brown compadres.

Right now I work with brown male doctors and brown male ASA ( Hospital secretaries). The brown doctors at my hospital are nice but I recently found out that most of them are cheating on their wives with some of nurses or even our medical assistants. Most of the wives of these brown male doctors are also brown and are super educated ( most of their wives are highly educated and many are doctors themselves). I often catch myself thinking, do their wives really not know ? Or are they okay with it ? Or just want to stay in the marriage because of culture ?

The other brown males that I work with, always are so obsessed with white women and develop these obsessive crushes on my white coworkers. Like this one guy was so obsessed with my friend ( who is a blonde white girl) and would buy her free coffee and lunch for no reason. She has no interest in him and has rejected him twice but he just doesn't get the message. He also gets super visibly upset whenever she speaks to other males in our workplace ( its so weird).

3) If you stand up for yourself at work, people will see you as reactive or rude vs when non brown women do the same thing they are praised for "" Standing up for themselves"".

4) You think your race doesn't matter when it comes to work and as long as you do your job right, then your race does not matter.

Unfortunately I also used to think this way but I realized how my skin color and they way I look sometimes puts me at a disadvantage compared to others. I spoke about this to my other brown and black female coworkers and they all agreed with me but also admitted that they were scared to feel this way and were living in denial because they did not want to use the ""race card"" as a reason for all their troubles at work.

I have also worked under non white WOC managers and they are not like this ( obviously there are exceptions cause I also had a horrible Indian female manager but it is usually rare).

  
2) Working with or under Brown Men ( millennial and gen Z men especially) is also the worst:  From my experience it doesn't matter if the brown guys is above you in rank or equal or lower, they have always treated me and my other brown female coworkers really poorly. Most of them will treat me exactly how the white women would treat me, almost like I am a second class citizen. Also I get the feeling that anytime I try to have a friendly conversation with them, they ignore me, give me one word answers and are mean or start thinking I like them or something. Also those same brown men will treat other non  brown women the complete opposite, that even if I complain to my managers, they think I am making it up or no one believes me.

I used to work at an Urgent Care as a MA during PT school and the Doctor that I was working with ( he was from India and in his late 40's) and he would literally scream at me and the other brown and black coworkers, while giving me orders vs being so nice to my white female coworkers and buying them lunch and making sure that they ""eat lunch"" or telling them ""make sure your eat"" while not even giving two flips about me or my brown compadres.

  
Right now I work with brown male doctors and brown male ASA ( Hospital secretaries). The brown doctors at my hospital are nice but I recently found out that most of them are cheating on their wives with some of nurses or even our medical assistants. Most of the wives of these brown male doctors are also brown and are super educated ( most of their wives are highly educated and many are doctors themselves). I often catch myself thinking, do their wives really not know ? Or are they okay with it ? Or just want to stay in the marriage because of culture ? 

  
The other brown males that I work with, always are so obsessed with white women and develop these obsessive crushes on my white coworkers. Like this one guy was so obsessed with my friend ( who is a blonde white girl) and would buy her free coffee and lunch for no reason. She has no interest in him and has rejected him twice but he just doesn't get the message. He also gets super visibly upset whenever she speaks to other males in our workplace ( its so weird).



3) If you stand up for yourself at work, people will see you as reactive or rude vs when non brown women do the same thing they are praised for "" Standing up for themselves"".

4) You think your race doesn't matter when it comes to work and as long as you do your job right, then your race does not matter. 

Unfortunately I also used to think this way but I realized how my skin color and they way I look sometimes puts me at a disadvantage compared to others. I spoke about this to my other brown and black female coworkers and they all agreed with me but also admitted that they were scared to feel this way and were living in denial because they did not want to use the ""race card"" as a reason for all their troubles at work.

The sisters would tell me about baptism every now and then and eventually i decided to be baptized

I was schedule to be baptized this saturday but an elder thought it would be better to postpone it cause ive been using cannabis

I was thinking of whether i should stop now or not and ended up deciding im not gonna stop it now

First of id never fight the church for such thing. Even if i would ""win"" the battle, id hate to be the guy who divides the community and makes some think ""well well well a revolutionary here"" so if thats the case, i trully loved being with them and would love to stay but that is an impasse

Then again is it revolutionary or anything disrespectful to the church? 

As far as i know it wasn't forbidden during Smiths times and, honestly, cannabis didnt cause 1/100 of the damage things like wheat and sugar caused throughout my life, which are two things that im working to withdraw from. Im around one month without sugar and life surely feels more clear. 

My point here is that i do understand the need to take care of our bodies. The elder who interviewed me is a rare case of a 19 years old man who trully looks as healthy and naturally strong as a 19 years old who wasnt corrupted by poison should look like so his parents definitely did a good job feeding him, much better than my parents no doubt about it so a mormon family surely deserves respect for such wisdom.

Then again i  believe we all see converts that surely should worry more about certain things not mentioned in the Word of Wisdom than cannabis or coffee or tea so i do have such disagreement with the Word of Widsom. I mean, shouldnt it at least be something that the church righteously recommend but leave it to our relation of God?

1lmbzf2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmbzf2,Vokus - Focus & Multitimer i build my own app,"Hi, I'm Andy!

I'm actually a classical guitarist, not a professional developer.

During the pandemic, I started learning Swift because I couldn’t find a timer that really worked for me. I just wanted something simple to help with focused practice or deep work. Most apps felt too bloated, messy, or just didn’t do what I needed.

So I built my own.

TestFlight link: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/g8RZfjVm](https://testflight.apple.com/join/g8RZfjVm)



It combines a clean solo timer for focus sessions with a flexible multitimer that lets you save and load timer lists. Great for structured practice routines, deep work blocks, or more complex workflows.

What Vokus can do:

TestFlight link: 

\-Clean Solo Timer for focused sessions with optional breaks (can be disabled)

\-Flexible Multitimer with support for saving and loading timer lists

\-Run entire timer lists automatically (optional)

\-Auto-delete finished timers (optional)

\-Live Activities & Dynamic Island

\-Dark Mode

\-Session statistics

\-CSV export



I use the app myself every day. Now it’s available as a public beta via TestFlight.

If you feel like giving it a try, I’d really appreciate your feedback, whether it’s about features, design or bugs.

Ok not that far back, but several years ago, the bank I worked for decided to try out ""extended hours."" Previously we had been drive up and lobby Monday to Friday 9-5. The new hours were the Monday to Friday 9-5 in the lobby with the drive up opening at 8 and Saturday 9-noon. Since we had to be there a half hour ahead and a half hour after that meant Saturday was a half day and full timers had an hour added to each of their other days to make up for the ""half day off."" 


We had a complete jerk for a manager let's call him (p)Rick. Absolutely no one was going to volunteer for Saturdays, because everyone knew (p)Rick would be be a (p)Rick and split your days off. Being the most recently promoted to supervisor meant I got assigned Saturdays, and no surprise Wednesdays off. 


I love to bake. It's calming, and since we had a full kitchen in that branch I decided I'd come in a bit earlier and throw a few tins of muffins in so they were ready when the tellers showed up. So everyone shows up, we have muffins, it's completely dead because no one thinks the bank is open on Saturday, we close and go home. It went over so well that the next Saturday I did the same thing. In a few weeks I've got some of the senior tellers volunteering to work Saturday if there are going to be muffins. 


Several weeks into this routine I have to take my mandated vacation week. All the other supervisors found reasons they weren't able to cover the Saturday shift, so (p)Rick ended up there. Things would probably have been fine for (p)Rick if he was in touch enough with his staff enough to know that the tellers expected fresh muffins on Saturday. Alas he was (p)Rick so he didn't know. 


If you've ever known anyone who is used to having a fresh muffin with their coffee on a Saturday morning, you can probably guess how they felt about there not being muffins. Since that particular Saturday the entire teller staff was made up of senior tellers, you can guess how willingly they expressed their displeasure to (p)Rick. All. Day. Long.

1lmbwfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditonwiki/comments/1lmbwfz/disaster_or_over_reacting_not_sure_at_this_point/,Disaster or over reacting? Not sure at this point.,"Hello Hello, I’m back again, with a disaster (?) date. Maybe I was being too harsh but either way.

So a few months ago, about April area I think, I went on two dates with this guy. He was really sweet, moved a little bit fast but I had blinders on for sure. We had a lot in common, the first date went well. We got food, talked, went to an arcade and bookstore, he got me a plush keychain I was looking at and some candies. Very nice, very cute.

One thing though, I like to think I can read people pretty well and my instincts were being set off, specifically my gaydar as a pansexual woman. Now I know how bad that sounds but just the energy he was giving off, it was setting off heavy alarms in my brain and gut, which weren’t helped by him showing me his favourite Yaoi manga at the bookstore. 

Sometimes you like what you like, even if you don’t lean that way and that’s fine, just made me side eye a little bit with what my mind was screaming at me but I digress.

Apparently, he had also drank like, A LOT of coffee on his drive into town, so admittedly he was a bit gassy and was hoping I wouldn’t notice. I just thought it was nerves and maybe he didn’t think it through before making the choice to have a bunch of coffee, so I brushed it off despite having a sensitive nose. And I’ll give him credit, I told him my sense of smell is rather strong and he did admit and apologize for needing to go to the bathroom often while we were out and for any smell. He was leaving me alone for 20 minutes at a time, to the point I thought maybe he didn’t like me and had ditched me, but he did come back.

He was sweet so I let it go.

Now, he was moving rather fast. He was using a pet name for me within a day after the date, then trying to have me unload my family trauma on him, along with telling me “I’d love to know every side of you” and making plans for the future.

Fast, but I was lonely honestly and liked feeling pampered for the first time in a year.
We make plans for a week from then to go out again, there’s a Bug Zoo in my city so as we’re both nerds, we plan to go to lunch then the bug zoo.

Day comes, I get dressed. I put in a lot of effort to my hair, my outfit is well thought out. He was dressed really well on the first date, nice black pants and a cardigan. He knows at this point I like wearing nice dresses and dressing up even for casual outings.

He texts me when he’s outside, so I go out and he gets out of the car to give me a hug.

On his shirt, is a Goku Pikachu.

Okay, yeah sure, we’re not going anywhere fancy after all.

The shirt though, was this stretchy, low quality almost spandex feeling fabric, you know that you get from a third party seller online? Think Wish graphic shirt.

But I brush it off, I’m wearing what makes me comfortable, who am I to control what someone else wears? Sure maybe Goku Pikachu isn’t something I would choose my second time meeting someone but I’m glad he’s comfortable enough to wear it second date.

So we’re driving, I’m still getting that weird feeling in my gut that just… something is off.

We go to a Filipino bakery downtown where I have a punch card for, we sit to eat and I recommend a bunch of pastries to him that I love from there. He eats maybe 2 of the stuff we bought, then says he isn’t hungry cause he ate a big breakfast. No problem, he paid for them so he can take them home, I don’t mind at all, I enjoyed what I ate and we talked about life for a bit.

We leave to the bug zoo, and after a few minutes in, he leaves me to go to the bathroom.

Oh no, it’s already beginning to be a repeat of last time.

He’s gone for like 20 minutes, I’m wandering around this two room bug zoo and enjoying the random bug facts I’m getting, waiting for the part about spiders when he comes back and apologized cause he’s once again, drank too much coffee and it upset his stomach. He also went to put more time on the car meter.

Alright sure, it happens, don’t know why you’d do that again knowing it upsets your stomach but we all make mistakes. And sure, don’t want to risk a ticket.

But then, every few minutes as we go through looking at the bugs, he’s making comments about poop. Like, a lot of comments about it. Poop and how much his stomach hurts. He’s pointing out bug poop, if one is in the process of pooping, and making poop jokes.

Why? I’m not sure.

Eventually, we leave when we’ve seen everything together, despite the fact I looked around the place for 20 minutes on my own already, I didn’t mind reading facts again and pointing cool things out to him.

As we’re in the gift shop though, we’re looking at bug shaped pride flags and I see a pansexual one, I get super excited. I’m explaining my mom loves getting Ally pins since both my brother and I are part of the LGBTQIA+, so I always look for pins for all of us when I see them. All he says is, “Oh… alright then.” And seems put off the rest of the time there.

We go on a drive after that to talk some more, we’re going to a popular ice cream place in one of the big parks of the city. While we’re going there he asks if I’ve ever been in a physical fight before, I say no, I’ve gotten mad at my parents or raised my voice at people but never been in a fight like that.

This man, don’t know why he thought this was a good story to tell.

He tells me that the last time he was at the beach we drove by, he was drunk with some friends and they were swimming. At some point, he got itchy down there and started to scratch himself in public. He was apparently scratching himself in such a way, that some stranger thought he was fully masterbaiting at the beach in public, and punched him in the face for doing that infront of his girlfriend and where kids could see him. He kept saying he couldn’t help that he was itchy, and he was drunk so he wasn’t thinking straight and that there wasn’t any kids around, but he thinks the guy was over reacting cause guys can’t help getting itchy there.

Like, dude, this isn’t the kind of story I think you should be telling. Not on a second date, not to someone you’ve known for two weeks, like that’s a story I personally, would take to the grave. But he’s laughing about it, I change the subject and we continue the drive.

At some point we stop at a look out place, looking over the ocean with a nice view. We’re talking about past relationships.

I’ve been in a few, I’m not afraid to admit that and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it, it’s helped me realize more what I want in relationships and given me lots of growth as well. I’m 24 now, I know what I want in a relationship because of those experiences.

And I don’t judge when he tells me he’s never been in a relationship, he’s 28 and the dating scene isn’t the greatest when you’re stuck on an island. That’s fair. He tells me that another reason is because he was traumatized when he was 14, cause he liked his best friend but she chose to go out with a guy he didn’t like instead of with him and their friends supported her choice so it made him cautious of dating. Alright sure, we all handle things differently, the way he described it bordered on NiceGuy territory in my mind since he kept saying the other guy wasn’t nice like him, but I won’t dismiss his feelings, he can let it out if he needs to.

At that point, I was already on the side of not seeing him in a romantic way, thought maybe we’d be better as friends. We kept talking and he’s telling me that he hasn’t tried socializing or getting out much till this year, so he’s experimenting with things. Life gets in the way so I get it.

His experimenting though, is going to raves and getting high on shrooms or other drugs. Something I’m very much not into, I have friends who do but it’s just not something I want for myself. If someone I know is doing it safely I’ll support them and be there if they need me, I just won’t do it myself and have had people try to pressure me in the past.

I’m just nodding, figuring in my mind that yeah we’re just in different points in our lives, different maturity levels, different points of finding who we are.

We talked about how sometimes the vibes just aren’t there as well, I say I’m totally okay with asking someone to just be friends if there isn’t a romantic connection, he seems upset by that. So then, we’re talking about the dating scene again, and we get to the topic of height on dating apps.

I’m barely over 5’1, I honestly don’t care about height and I know most women really don’t either. He had said on his profile that he was 5’8, definitely more close to 5’4, and I’m honest with him; I tell him I don’t care how tall someone is, I only care if they lie about it.

He starts getting a bit upset with me, saying dating is harder for guys because women care so much about height and a lot won’t date shorter guys. I tell him that I don’t think the issue is height, a lot of women I know and have read opinions from don’t care how short a guy is, the only thing they actually care about is if they lie about it, cause if someone can lie about their height for no reason then what else will they lie about?

He just grumbles out a “yeah okay” then asks if I want to go to the ice cream place. I was craving it, so we go, conversation is a little awkward at that point cause I guess we were both feeling the off vibes. I pay for food for me and a drink for him, and he drives me home.

When I get out of the car, he asks me to fill his water bottle for his drive home then also gives me the Filipino pastries I was excited for him to try. I try to get him to keep them, he says no that’s okay, so I fill his water bottle, he says hi to my cat (who doesn’t like him but she doesn’t like most people) and he leaves.

Never texts me again, I was honestly gonna ask him if he wanted to be friends cause we did have things in common but I guess that saved me the trouble?

I don’t know if it was his kinda put off reaction to me being open about being pansexual and liking women too, if it was my opinion about dating and becoming friends or what I said about height, but oh well.

Least I got to see some cool bugs and have some good Filipino food.

Wanted to share my story because reading these posts helped me so much — and if you’re anxious, I’ve been there. I just went through a medical abortion via Aid Access at about 5–6 weeks and overall, it was a really manageable, even positive experience. Hopefully this helps someone else feel less alone or scared.

⸻

Timeline + Context:
	•	5–6 weeks pregnant
	•	Two previous full-term pregnancies (one C-section)
	•	Got meds from Aid Access - live in TX and there were no issues w delivery. Ordered Friday night and they arrived Tuesday morn.
	•	Took mifepristone on a Wednesday afternoon, misoprostol Thursday night around 7:30pm

⸻

Prep:
	•	Took 800mg ibuprofen an hour before miso
	•	Took Zofran for nausea prevention (super helpful)
	•	Waited until kids were asleep and the house was calm
	•	Had everything ready: maxi pads, heating pad, water, snacks, and a distraction
	•	Took 4 misoprostol buccally (between cheeks and gums) — they didn’t fully dissolve in 30 min, which is normal, so I swallowed the remains

⸻

What Happened:
	•	Cramping was surprisingly mild — never more than a 2/10. Heating pad was a HERO. 
	•	Bleeding started about an hour later, along with small to medium clots (biggest maybe tangerine-sized)
	•	I took a second dose of 2 misoprostol at 11pm — probably didn’t need it, but wanted to be sure everything cleared
	•	About an hour after that, I passed a larger clot and felt a wave of wooziness/dizziness and general discomfort — honestly, I think this was partly due to just being exhausted (I usually go to bed by 9:30 and it was a lot for my body)
	•	That passed fairly quickly, especially after passing more clots. Once the major stuff came out, I felt way better.
	•	Around 4am I had some diarrhea (normal with miso) but otherwise was able to sleep in short amounts

⸻

Next Day:
	•	Bleeding slowed way down to a light flow
	•	Cramps just felt like a period
	•	No more big clots
	•	I felt tired and a bit weak, but also really relieved
	•	My husband made me toast and coffee and I felt like a new person 😂

⸻

Reflections:
	•	I was superrrrrrrr anxious about pain and nausea — but it ended up being a much gentler process than I expected.
	•	Having a plan (ibuprofen, Zofran, snacks, HEATING PAD, comfort setup) made a huge difference
	•	I plan to test in about 4 weeks to confirm everything’s cleared
	•	Emotionally, I feel okay — definitely tired, but mostly grateful and calm

⸻

If you’re scared:
	•	That’s okay. I was too.
	•	But this doesn’t have to be excruciating or traumatic. For me, it was a night of discomfort, and then it was over.
	•	You are not alone, and you are stronger than you think.

1lmbtin,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1lmbtin/victorians_anonymous_va/,Victorians Anonymous (VA),"I have a confession to make. I am addicted to this game. I have downed countless hours into Victoria 3, Europa Universalis 4, Hearts of Iron 4, and Crusader Kings 3 but **THIS RECENT PATCH HAS RUINED ME.** 

1.9 is perfect. It is so good I can't even explain it to anyone else. I read every dev diary the day they came out, salivating at the new content. The date of the update was marked in my calendar and I bought it as soon as it came out on steam. I have clocked close to 80 hours in the past month to Victoria 3 alone. I played hours before so I would be ready for the new features and I played after because it was intoxicating. It is to the point where I dream about seeing the green line go up. I have dreamed about ousting the landowners from power and establishing monopolies. I have dreamed about the most optimal way to export opium to the Qing to rake in hoard of money. I can't focus on anything else. It has started to damage my real world relationships as well. Once a friend asked me to play a game. I said I was busy, went offline, turned on activity privacy, and played Victoria 3....by myself.... Instead of going outside I play Victoria 3. I even set my alarm to wake up at 8 in the morning to wake up and play Victoria 3. I sometimes skip meals to play Victoria 3. 

No one else understands my madness. There is something so utterly satisfying about this game. The early game feeling of building those first few logging camps and iron mines to fuel your construction. The feeling of slowing making coal mines to get steel and improve your production methods. The feeling of establishing your first company and getting that sweet sweet throughput bonus and prestige good. The feeling of getting better education laws and reducing land owner power. No worldly drug could compare. Then you start making more barracks and naval bases, getting ready to assert your power beyond your own borders. You get laissez faire and financial districts propel your nation to new heights. Even the endgame is so captivating. As soon as pumpjacks are researched oil becomes the new gold. It is heavenly. I never get bored. If I am feeling like I'm tired, I scroll on the subreddit and get inspired for a new run.

The other day, my friends staged an intervention to help me with this issue. It has been 24 hours since then. These were the most excruciating 24 hours of my life. I didn't get out of bed till 10 in depression. I woke up and scrolled the subreddit for 20 minutes. I read the hotfix notes for 1.9.5 three times. I listened to the Victoria 3 soundtrack on Spotify while doing work. I sat on my couch for an hour pretending I was exporting my reserve coffee and river plate beef to Europe as Brazil. I sat at my computer for 2 hours watching Victoria 3 playthroughs and reviews. I opened up steam to read the recent reviews for the game as well. I am in gut wrenching pain. My skin itches. My hand is twitching. I don't have anything to do. Nothing gives the same dopamine boost. Nothing. 

I don't think I have a life outside of Victoria 3. It is all consuming. This game has a monopoly on my time. This is both the best and worst use of my money. 10 cents per hour of pure unadulterated gratification. That is the price. Close to 700 hours in this game (rookie numbers I know). But if I keep going at this pace, I might hit 1000 by the end of this year or die from stress. 

This is why I am starting a new support group for people like us. People who might end up homeless if they keep dedicating every waking moment to this game. People who are losing friends and family to this game. People who want to play, just play less than 40 hours a week. Victorians Anonymous is a group where we can recover and play sustainably. (Unless 1.10 is even better, in which case I will throw myself back into this game with no regard to my future.)

They said I have to make it to Wednesday July 2nd. Wish me luck.",5,1751077367.0,victoria3,1,1.0,False

1lmbqsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofOtago/comments/1lmbqsg/my_struggle_at_university/,My struggle at University,"I've been browsing some of the old threads that start off with OP talking about how they feel lonely and stuff, and everyone is like ""Don't worry its halls you will be fine"" or ""You're new, don't worry it might take the first year to find a good solid group"". I once believed that I too could be like that and one of them.

But it has now been almost 3 years, I will be turning 21 in a few months and heading into my final semester of my Bachelors' in Science. Not once during any of my labs or lectures have I managed to find anyone. Everyone always just says ""Go to everything at uni!! Meet people there"" but I don't honestly understand any of that (How can you make friends when listening to the lecturer and taking notes?). For my labs, most of it has been individual work. On the rare chance that there is group work, I immediately feel isolated from the rest of the group(s), who already have had previous connections. When I try to extend it briefly outside the work bounds it never ends up working when we are done, it just drops off. 

As for clubs, I've only ever been motivated to join the Computer Science club, but been trying to get into for these 3 years. It never works out though, most of the time I just sit at the back for a while, watching everyone else talk in their small little groups. I feel like it's not fair I have to be there alone, everyone else seems to come with someone else and then they all join up and be social together. Eventually I just get up and leave 10 minutes in. Sometimes I can't even make it into the room, I just look in through the window and that is as close as I can get. I feel like I've always been a bit disappointed by the options available, so many feel cultural based or degree based which IMO makes them very isolating. As a white person born in NZ, I don't think I fit really into any of them. 

SHS hasn't been the best. For 3 years now I have been increasing/changing my medicine, and now I'm hitting the limit of venlafaxine. I'm planning on asking to be referred to a psychiatrist for adjacent/multiple medications at once. Trying to get counselling has been an absolute nightmare; but I have had some experiences with the Polytech's Kowhai center. I feel like it only briefly helps as I can get shit off my chest to another student and just an chance to actually talk IRL, but I don't think there is any long term progress that I can make (nor are they allowed to, they said that they have to take a more passive/listening role). 

The only real socializing I do is at work. It's a weird thing, I'm able to get along and chat with both other university students/people my age and older coworkers. I'm able to be bright and helpful to both staff and customers, and they seem to like me. Why can't I do this at Uni? I wish I could just put that mask on and keep it on the whole time. Sometimes at work I almost feel normal, but then occasionally someone will say something that makes me remember I am not normal; not like you. For example, we were talking about who can take who out on a night for drinking and they asked how many drinks I usually have on a night out. Of course I managed to make it up and make it all smooth, but that stung me pretty hard. I've felt like I have missed out on a huge massive chapter of my life. 

For 3 years now, I have looked on in envy. It fascinates me, how people interact and get along with one another. It all seems to natural and I wish I could be like that. It's all like a puzzle piece, where everyone else fits together and is able to go with the flow. I'm jealous of their smiles, their warm comforting body language and their energy. And yes this of course extends to romantic relationships too, honestly I have no idea why any girl would want to be with me when every other dude seems to be more expressive, handsome, and sociable, with tan, smooth skin, bright eyes, and luscious hair. I don't think I have to explicit state how I don't like the look of myself, but at the end of the day I don't think that looks should be as important in just pure friendship and not romantic. But in first impressions? Maybe. I could go on a rant about being partially blackpilled/pessimistic and believing that I have bad genes, but I'm not. I try to convince myself I don't need you, I don't need friends or a lover, but that's a pathetic attempt to lie to myself. By now, we all know the real effects and damage caused by chronic loneliness.

Sometimes I feel like people don't truly get what it is like to be this lonely. Sometimes I see posts online talking about this but then I go to their profile and see their other posts of them out at a coffee shop or what not. I remember on the rare chance I got a match on a shitty dating app and we started talking that this idea came up and she said that she too felt quite isolated and alone. At another point in time, we were talking about how dating apps are and she revealed the amount of matches she gets, which made me think ""Oh she doesn't get how I feel"". Some of you may feel like you are in the same position as me, but I lack what I like to call the ""basics"": Random/old friends that you send reels/tiktoks to, people that you do streaks/snap replies to, hell even the fact of just having your group members or people in your class following you is a step above what I experience. Sometimes, I will go a full day without even speaking out one word. 

I have to confess, I do follow a few students on Instagram, which was for making a group chat to sort out group projects and stuff. But in the end, that has only increased my pain. I'm extremely self-aware and know all about how social media damages your mental health and how it is not real, but I believe that while that it is true for most people, it is different for me. You see, most of the time it references things such as: shopping at high end shops/cafes, having nice luxuries, taking nice holidays, constantly going out etc. And you, as a normal person with a stable social and love life, begins to believe that they are falling behind and that you should be with them. But the problem is with me the depravity has become so extreme that even normal posts hurt me and make me envious. Small things like getting a coffee and tagging your friend in with it, posting a happy birthday for your other friend, or posting you and your friends going to the gym together astound me and hurt me so much. 

At the end of the day, I feel invisible, slipped through the gaps of student life at university. You may not notice me, but I notice you, all of you, and am jealous of you all and wish I could be you. Not even with how you have friends, but even the small little nods of acknowledgement as you pass someone you vaguely know in your lab, or when you say you should catch up with other people. I feel like you are all in a net that I have fallen down and now sinking to the depths of the ocean. 

As I approach the end of my time at university, only my fears increase. How can I, someone who has struggled this much at uni, go into the real world and try and make friends and be a real person. I recently saw a tiktok talking about this and felt like it really spoke to me here: [https://www.tiktok.com/@blisabutimfamous/video/7518975246653738254?lang=en](https://www.tiktok.com/@blisabutimfamous/video/7518975246653738254?lang=en) . How do it just ""work out"" for other people but I have fallen down so far? Sometimes I reason it by saying that I am broken, a defective piece that cannot be changed. For 3 years, I have been in pain. For 3 years, I have looked on at you, envious and wishing I was you. For 3 years, I have struggled and only gotten worse.

1lmbq3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/1lmbq3o/my_father_the_kevinthe_third_and_final_chapter/,My Father the Kevin--The Third and Final Chapter,"Hello again, Reddit.  This marks the third time that I’ve elected to tell you about the biggest Kevin I know–my father.  

Dad is not your usual Kevin.  My father is what happens when a normal Kevin snorts depleted uranium and then hatefucks a rabid goat.  Kevin has spent the past sixty-nine years of his life believing that he is the smartest man alive and destined for greatness.  Accordingly, he has been continually disappointed.  Kevin spent frivolously, alienated every person who tried to help him, and is now destined for a cheap cremation and a memorial plaque on a wall.

If you’re interested Kevin’s exploits until now, you can check out part 1 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/16byk04/my\_dad\_the\_kevin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/16byk04/my_dad_the_kevin/) and part 2 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/1d3qsot/my\_dad\_the\_kevin\_part\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/1d3qsot/my_dad_the_kevin_part_2/)

u/undercookedbrotato is tagged a few times in this thread.  He's my little brother.

Thankfully, Kevin isn’t able to do any more damage, on account that he has Alzheimer’s.  Hospice has told me today that his FAST scores put him at a “7D”--and the scale only runs to 7F.  This means that Kevin has only one more drama trip to pull.  Knowing him, he’s probably going to do it on my birthday.

Anyway, I’m recounting a final batch of stories about my father.  Why?  Part sadness, part relief, and part anger.  Also, therapy’s fucking expensive.  So enjoy!  

* The TV show “Star Trek” aired in 1967, when Kevin was about ten or eleven.  Like many kids of the time, he loved the show, and would often pretend to be Captain Kirk during his bouts of make-believe.  One of the things he liked best about Kirk is that he always flirted with his yeoman, Janice Rand, who was played by Grace Lee Whitney.  Kevin developed an infatuation with the actress.  This puppy love extended into adulthood.  His eyes just about popped out of his head whenever he watched Star Trek reruns.
* In 1992, Kevin took me to the Albuquerque Star Trek convention, where Grace Lee Whitney was the guest celebrity.  We stood in line for an hour to meet her and I got her autograph!  Then Kevin took the autograph, said he would hold onto it for me “for safekeeping,” and proceeded to keep that thing on his chest-of-drawers until it finally went missing.  I still don’t know where that fucking autograph is, and I want it back.
* In my first post about Kevin, I recounted how Kevin once forced open an elevator door because he wanted to see the inside of an elevator shaft.  When talking about this with my mother, she reminded me that Kevin did this at the Albuquerque Marriott–you know, the famous one that’s shaped like a pyramid?  Moreover, the elevator shafts there are GLASS.  So yes, Kevin forced open the doors of elevator so he could see the shaft when the entire fucking thing was already transparent.   
* Kevin made me get an amateur radio license after I turned twelve.  He tried to make me get one when I was ten, but I made a compromise with him: I’d get a license when I turned twelve if he would leave me alone.  Being ten, I then forgot about my deal.  This would come back to haunt me.  
* Do you know that classic episode of “The Simpsons” where Homer decides to buy Marge a present, so he buys her a bowling ball and has his own name engraved on it?  For my twelfth birthday, I got ham radio equipment as my “gift” from Kevin and a ham radio test study guide.  I wanted Micro Machine Star Wars shit.  I instead got a Morse code CD-ROM.
* After I took and passed my ham radio test, Kevin was over the moon.  He took out a big ad in the “classified” section of the newspaper and put my sixth grade school picture in there, along with huge text that read “congratulations to the county’s youngest ham radio operator!”  Dad should have just tattooed “NERD” on my forehead and sent me to school with a wedgie, because you better believe that nerfed a lot of my aspirations of being popular, or even socially functional.
* My Christmas present from Kevin that year was my ham radio call sign as a belt buckle.  He didn’t understand why I didn’t want to wear it to school.
* Kevin decided he was going to sell “internet real estate.”  Kevin didn’t know anything about URLs.  Kevin paid somebody else to make a website for him so he could sell website space to other people.  The other person ghosted Kevin and took his money. 
* Kevin threatened to sue them.  The other party, likely not being in the United States to begin with, did not care.  Kevin sought out the services of an attorney, who promptly told Kevin to get out of his office.
* Kevin decided to redecorate the kitchen.  He got as far as pulling down the wallpaper.  That was all the renovation he ever did.  Mom was furious.
* Kevin’s pastor told him that he wasn’t allowed to talk about Amway at church anymore.  
* Kevin became a Freemason.  They told him he wasn’t allowed to talk about Prepaid Legal at meetings anymore.  
* When Kevin finally got work again when I was in high school, the electric company started doing work down the street for his workplace.  They had to block the road and everything.  Kevin called the electric company, claiming to be a representative from his workplace, and stated that they needed to move their vehicles IMMEDIATELY.  It did not end well for Kevin when the electric company called his boss and told on him.
* After I graduated college, Kevin’s Air Force Reserve unit deployed to Uzbekistan.  Kevin would call us on his unit’s satellite phone to complain about the internet speed.
* Kevin had a thing for big breasted blonde women of Germanic origin.  When he went to the Epcot World Pavilion, he proceeded to go to the Germany section, get drunk by one in the afternoon, and spend an awkward amount of time trying to ask out waitresses at the buffet because he was “being a wingman for u/thewrongbakedpotato.”  I had to shout him down and apologize to the waitress.  I’m pretty sure Mom smacked him, too.  
* Joke’s on Kevin.  Six years later, I got married to a Filipina.
* Kevin and his wife took a European river cruise vacation.  Right before they left Berlin to come home, Kevin stuffed himself silly on baked beans.  He then farted all the way across the Atlantic.  Mom says that the poor Germans on that aircraft hadn’t seen chemical warfare like that since 1918.  She said that it was offensive, loud, boisterous, unruly, and that Kevin was totally unapologetic.  
* Kevin decided he was going to become a cat breeder and breed Himalayan cats.  He got as far as mapping out where he was going to keep the pens, and then showed the idea to my mom.  Kevin apparently decided he was going to keep the pens for long-haired cats in an unconditioned storage shed in Florida.  Mom put her foot down and said that was incredibly stupid and dangerous.  Kevin got his feelings hurt and said that if she felt that way, he just wouldn’t breed cats, then.  Those notional cats dodged a huge bullet. 
* Kevin loves Western movies.  Western movies inspire Kevin.  They inspire him to drink whiskey, most specifically.  Kevin loved to watch “Deadwood” on HBO and drink whiskey.  Ordinarily, this wouldn’t be a horrible thing . . . except that Kevin would put on “Deadwood” before he had to go work the night shift.  Kevin called out of work a lot.
* Kevin used to like to meet up with a buddy after work and have a beer.  This is ordinarily not a bad thing . . . except that Kevin and his friend would pull their trucks over to the side of the highway and drink their beers right in front of all the cars passing by.  Unsurprisingly, Kevin got ticketed for an open container.  He’s lucky the cop didn’t push for a DUI.
* Kevin would get bizarrely religious when he wanted to win an argument.  One day, when I was home on leave from the Army, I took u/undercookedbrotato out the CD store and I bought him some classic heavy metal albums.  Slayer, Metallica, Megadeth, Judas Priest, that sort of thing.  Kevin flipped his lid, screaming that he wasn’t going to allow “Satanic music” in his house–which was totally hypocritical, because Kevin loved to tell us about the time he saw Black Sabbath in concert.  Anyway, we later found the CDs in Kevin’s collection.  Fuck you, Kevin.
* u/undercookedbrotato got a cheap MP3 player for Christmas from Belk’s.  You could add pictures to it, but had to do so through Windows Media Player.  While setting it up for u/undercookedbrotato, I found Kevin’s porn stash . . . on the family computer, of course.  Kevin freaked out and said that the MP3 player must have had a virus.  Why a Chinese factory would send random American families German porn, I dunno, but Kevin was INSISTENT on this.  When I doubted him, Kevin then claimed it was his boss that sent the porn.  
* Kevin’s workplace decided to have an “active shooter” drill.  They contracted with an outside security agency to make the training as realistic as possible.  All employees were told about the drill, and they practiced ahead of time.  Kevin was told that, when the drill was to sound, he was to lock the door to his workroom, shut off the lights, get down on the floor, and remain silent.  Instead, the supposed gunman walked right into Kevin’s workspace (which was unlocked), and found Kevin cruising the internet and drinking coffee while listening to Pink Floyd.
* The trainer pointed a fake firearm at Kevin and announced, “bang.  You’re dead.”  Kevin’s response?  “Uh-uh.  YOU MISSED.”
* The entire affair, including his flippant response, got him in trouble at work.  Again.  However, he did come home and tell the story, which the family DID appreciate.
* Sadly, however, I’ve since learned that Kevin’s entire exchange mirrors a “Calvin and Hobbes” strip almost exactly.  I was a big fan of the strip while I was in middle school and high school, and often had the treasury collection lying around for bathroom reading.  Kevin likely got the idea from there.  Even when Kevin was being creative, he was copying somebody else.  

[https://www.reddit.com/r/calvinandhobbes/comments/15tlsfh/did\_you\_miss\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/calvinandhobbes/comments/15tlsfh/did_you_miss_me/)

* During the conflict with Islamic State, Kevin became convinced that ISIS was trying to kill him (probably because of the Jordan deployment where Al-Qaeda in Iraq blew up the hotel six months after he left).  Whenever he would travel anywhere, he would check the local safety advisories.  He literally thought ISIS had deployed sleeper agents into Florida to whack him.  When we would tell him not to worry because he wasn’t that important, he’d get angry.  We found it easier to just leave him to his delusion because he seemed happier that way.  
* Kevin told his wife that he would move the family to Alaska so they could be closer to me and my kids.  Kevin had just gotten fired from his job for having porn on his computer, but he was able to get a new job lined up.  On the day of the move, Kevin got cold feet and didn’t go to the airport.  Kevin then took the rest of the day off, because he had to cancel the movers and utilities and back out of the pending sale of his house.
* Kevin also got all sorts of phone calls from family members absolutely PISSED at his shenanigans.  At about five in the afternoon, Kevin did the only thing he could think of to make the criticism of him stop: he threatened to kill himself.
* After telling me to “mail him some rope so he could make us happy,” I called Mom and told her to call his bluff and take him to the local ER.  Kevin suddenly wasn’t suicidal anymore when he realized how much the hospital bill would likely be.
* Kevin stopped worrying about ISIS trying to kill him when he got a different job in Alaska (and this time, he actually went.  Mom threatened divorce otherwise).  He then became overly worried about polar bears trying to kill him.
* Kevin lived in Fairbanks.  Save for the taxidermied one at the airport, there are no polar bears in Fairbanks.
* I drew a picture of a polar bear in a turban wielding a sniper rifle and posted it on Kevin’s fridge when he was out.  He didn’t talk to me for three days.  10/10, would do again.
* Kevin is bald.  Kevin decided he wanted to reinvent himself for his move.  Kevin “invested” in a “hair system for men.”  It cost $6000.  Kevin didn’t keep up with his toupees and stopped wearing them after two months.
* Kevin would often get into bizarre fits of one-up-manship with me.  When I bought a car, he’d try to buy a more expensive one.  If I got a degree, he’d register for classes, too.  When I closed on a new house, he’d try to get pre-qualified for a bigger one.  The weirdest flex he tried to pull is when he claimed he outranked me in the military.  He was an Air Force tech sergeant.  I was an Army captain.  He said “time is service is what really decides who outranks who.”  Protip: It is not.
* I was cleaning out my email box when I found an email from Amazon that said, “your purchase of Women’s College Volleyball has been successful.”  Now, I’m not a big volleyball fan, and the only sporting event I watch is the Superbowl, so I started doing some digging.  Turns out that I had forgotten to log out of my Amazon account at my parent’s house, Kevin decided to go looking for eye candy, and apparently decided to see if Amazon offered streaming porn.  When he realized they didn’t, he settled for women’s sports.  Anyway, Kevin lost Amazon and Netflix privileges.
* Kevin was totally tone deaf.  He could not distinguish people’s voices from each other.  He once mistook my wife’s voice for \*his\* wife . . . and my wife has a heavy Filipino accent.  To that end, he called every female singer “Pat Benetar.”  Whenever a song by a woman came on the radio, he’d happily crank up the volume.  “It’s Pat Benetar!  I haven’t heard this one!”  Uh, no, Kevin, that’s Lady Gaga.  
* The night he got caught in his infidelity, Kevin tried to wave it away by saying, “it could be worse!  I could have been looking to have sex with another man!”  I sighed and told him that I’d actually have MORE sympathy for him if that was the case.  He didn’t understand.
* The last time Kevin went to vote, he made it very clear he wanted to vote for Trump.  Instead, he somehow managed to vote for the Party for Socialism and Liberation.
* Now that Kevin is in memory care, we’re just now untangling the mess of financial and legal ruin he left in his wake.  It involves lots and lots of calls to credit unions, lawyers, and the Internal Revenue Service.  Through it all, I’ve encouraged my mother to NOT divorce him–because she’ll be entitled to half of his pension from the government and she will 100% be in a better place financially when he finally croaks.  Sometimes, the greatest thing you can do for your family is to stop being in it.

That all being said, you may think that Kevin was a terrible father and a terrible man.  You’d mostly be right.  But there were some small things about my father that I treasure.  It was in those moments that you’d see a bright star of potential–of things that could have been–had it not been for his narcissism and selfishness.  Like when he spent money that I know he didn’t really have to get me Nintendo 64 for Christmas the year they came out.  Or the fact that he DID wait in line for an hour with me to meet Grace Lee Whiteny (even though he then stole the autograph).  Or when he came over to my house unexpectedly when I had the day off and made enchilada casserole just because he felt like it that day.  Or the day I got my Master’s Degree and he bought me one of those stupidly expensive degree frames that the university bookstore was hocking outside the civic center.  Hell, I honestly think he was more excited than I was.  It did, after all, inspire him to sign up for his own Master’s course load and then drop all the classes.

Kevin, I still go visit you twice a week in memory care even though your brain is now made of strudel.  You can’t walk, can’t talk, and it’s obvious you don’t have a fucking clue who I am.  I bring you cookies and chips and you remember THOSE well enough, because I always feel bad for the nursing home staff who have to sweep up after you after you demolish them like a three-year-old in a candy shop.  You weren’t a good dad, but you were mine.  Despite everything you put me through, there’s a part of me that’s going to miss your antics when you finally pass from this earth.  (Not having my identity or my car stolen, though.  I’m not going to miss that at all.)   

Kevin, here’s a toast containing a bad batch of Christmas toilet pruno.  I gotta say, you sure made an impression.  Mostly a bad one, but hell, at least we got the memori . . .

1lmbq17,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmbq17,30M Philippines - Someone I can share my life and my faith with,"Call me R. I’m a university professor, wedding officiant, political trainer, and — surprise — a preacher. I’ve helped people say “I do,” stood at pulpits with trembling conviction, and taught classrooms filled with restless souls. And yet, here I am, still hoping someone might say “I do” to me.

I’m the kind of man who buys coffee for the girl who cancels last minute, still writes thank-you notes for heartbreaks, and jokes with cab drivers even when my heart is quietly breaking. My life has been many things — structured, chaotic, public, painfully lonely — but never loveless. I’ve loved deeply. I still do. Maybe I always will.

What I’m looking for?
Someone who doesn’t get scared off by the title pastor or the fire that comes with it.
Someone who can laugh at life’s messiness and still believe in good endings.
Someone who’s not just passing through.

I’m not perfect. I get tired. I overshare. I carry people longer than I should.
But if you’re looking for a man who’ll hold your story like scripture, walk beside you when everyone else runs… I might be worth your scroll.

Drop me a hello. Or just whisper a prayer my way.

Area of study/work:
University professor by day, pastor by divine calling, and wedding officiant on weekends. I juggle classrooms, pulpits, and love stories. Political Science is my academic playground; the Gospel is my core.

Hobbies/interests:
Coffee shops, books with bent spines, podcasts, spontaneous road trips, language learning (German and Russian!), and planning a wedding I hope will be mine someday. I love music that tells stories — from Schlager to Christian rock. I write letters. Real ones.

Tell us a bit about your Christian journey:
I was broken, then called, then sent. Serving Christ hasn’t always been easy — the burden of ministry, heartbreak, and loneliness still sting — but the cross remains heavier than all of it, and I carry it with joy. I preach from scars, not just scriptures. I’m committed, not perfect.

Age range:
25–38

Would you be willing to do long distance/relocate?
Yes. If the connection is real, so is the commitment. I’ll pack my suitcase and my sermons.",5,1751077057.0,ChristianDating,0,1.0,False

My billionaire husband spent hundreds of thousands of dollars sponsoring the graduation art exhibition of a female college student he had been supporting for two years.  
  
However, when I asked him for two thousand dollars to pay for our son's medical expenses, he refused.  
  
No matter how I pleaded, my husband Edwin Stone remained unmoved. With tears streaming down my face, I sold the engagement ring he had custom-made for millions at a low price.  
  
I took the money and rushed back to the hospital.  
  
As I walked down the long corridor, I heard the sharp beeping of machines from the room at the end of the hall.  
  
Then, within seconds, the world came to an eerie standstill, as if someone had pressed the pause button.  
  
""I'm sorry, Ms. Chloe, please accept our condolences...""  
  
""Actually, if the medical fees had been paid a few days earlier, this wouldn't have happened.""  
  
""Our hospital has a policy: if patients or their families don't pay medical fees on time, we cannot proceed with treatment. I'm very sorry, Ms. Chloe, we really did our best... Please take care of yourself...""  
  
I opened my mouth, but the pain and suffocation in my throat made it impossible to speak.  
  
I dragged my heavy legs to the bedside, not knowing how to face my son's death.  
  
Just this morning, the child lying in bed had been smiling and calling me ""Mom.""  
  
The TV on the white wall flickered for a moment before the signal returned, and Edwin's face appeared on the screen.  
  
He was smiling.  
  
This usually cold man stood behind the female student he sponsored, greeting every exhibition visitor with gentle politeness.  
  
Some bold people didn't hesitate to gossip about their relationship in front of the media cameras:  
  
""Mr. Edwin and Ella aren't just sponsor and beneficiary, right?""  
  
""Come on, tell us, is there a story between you two?""  
  
Ella blushed shyly at these teasing remarks, her eyes full of love as she constantly looked toward Edwin.  
  
Edwin didn't deny these comments.  
  
From the smile at the corner of his mouth, you could tell he was enjoying it.  
  
""But isn't Mr. Edwin married? His child is five years old this year. Have Mr. Edwin Stone and Mrs. Stone already divorced but not made it public?""  
  
The crowd fell silent for a few seconds, and the person who asked the question shrank back into the crowd, not daring to speak again.  
  
Ella looked somewhat embarrassed in front of the camera. She turned her head and asked the man timidly:  
  
""Edwin, why didn't Chloe come to the exhibition? Is she still angry about the auction incident?""  
  
""Should I go apologize to Chloe again?""  
  
Edwin refused without hesitation.  
  
""No need.""  
  
""I've spoiled her too much, which has made her petty now. It was just a valuable piece of jewelry, and she actually hit you over it. Since she's become so money-obsessed, I won't give her a single dollar. I won't let you take that slap for nothing.""  
  
""Seeing her take her anger out on you made me very angry.""  
  
His protectiveness convinced everyone of the speculation about Edwin and my marital troubles, while also making most people think I was the one at fault for this relationship breakdown.  
  
""Mrs. Stone must be a very petty person. It must be exhausting to be around someone like that. No wonder Mr. Edwin fell in love with Ella.""  
  
""But they have a child together, right? If they really divorce, what about the child?""  
  
""If Mr. Edwin and Ella continue their relationship, they'll definitely get married in the future. Being a stepmother in a billionaire family won't be easy.""  
  
I didn't know if I was angrier or sadder.  
  
The air conditioning in the hospital room was very cold, and the cold air seemed to drill into my body.  
  
I was shivering all over and couldn't help but remind the family at the next bed:  
  
""Could you turn up the temperature a bit? My child has been having diarrhea and can't catch cold again.""  
  
I don't know how long passed, but that cold air kept drilling into the bottom of my heart.  
  
I angrily looked up and met the nurse's terrified eyes.  
  
""Ms. Chloe... usually, family members are not allowed to stay in the morgue for more than 15 minutes. You've been here all afternoon. Please leave now.""  
  
""The doctor is urging you to sign the death certificate, and your child's father—he still hasn't appeared. Now that the child has passed away, he should show up, don't you think? You should try to contact him.""  
  
My head felt like it was going to explode.  
  
I completely came to my senses and staggered to my feet, walking out.  
  
The process of handling the death certificate was quick.  
  
In less than two hours, I stood in the cold wind, dialing the funeral home with shaking hands.  
  
Then I called Edwin more than thirty times. Unsurprisingly, all went unanswered.  
  
Leaning against the cold wall, I couldn't help but mock myself.  
  
The funeral home staff arrived and took away my son's body.  
  
Throughout the journey, I don't know how many times I fainted from crying.  
  
At the funeral home, the staff immediately placed my son in cold storage. Then they gently suggested I go home and bring back some of his favorite clothes for him to wear.  
  
Clean and tidy.  
  
Yes.  
  
My son, like Edwin, had a cleanliness obsession.  
  
""After the deceased's body arrives at the funeral home, it's usually cremated within 72 hours, but if the family requests, we can extend the time—3 days, 5 days, or even 7 days. Do you need this?""  
  
I reached out to touch my son's cold face. ""3 days.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I stumbled home late at night.  
  
When Edwin saw me, the smile in his eyes disappeared.  
  
""Why are you so late? How's Leo? Ella heard he had diarrhea and was very worried—she asked me to bring some medicine back.""  
  
I avoided the medicine he handed me and looked at the expiration date on the box. I let out a cold laugh, and tears flowed uncontrollably again.  
  
""Expired medicine—who is she trying to kill?""  
  
Edwin's expression froze on his face. He quickly flipped the box over to hide the production date, then his expression became impatient again.  
  
""Ella probably just didn't notice. Can you stop blaming her? She's pregnant, you know she has to be careful with medication. She's only in her twenties—how could she think of so much?""  
  
""Also, why didn't you come to Ella's art exhibition today? I told you days ago that it was important, and you just had to cause trouble on this day?""  
  
Edwin instinctively defended Ella by scolding me—not even noticing how red my eyes were.  
  
""Do you still remember why you originally sponsored Ella?""  
  
Edwin paused.  
  
""You forgot, didn't you?""  
  
""Then do you remember when your relationship with her crossed the line?""  
  
I looked at him calmly. ""Do you remember what you said to me that night after I caught you two in bed?""  
  
The living room fell silent.  
  
A faint scent of vetiver floated in the air—triggering memories of Edwin and me from the past.  
  
Ella was a college student Edwin met two years ago when he was on a business trip to a rural town.  
  
At the time, she was upset because her conservative family was pressuring her to drop out of school and marry the son of a local church elder—a man she barely knew and didn't love.  
  
She cried to Edwin about how hard she had worked to attend school and how unfair her parents were. Her fierce resistance moved Edwin.  
  
So he brought her back.  
  
He got her into a prestigious university, just a short drive from the Stone family estate.  
  
He bought her an apartment, gave her a luxury car, and gave her a card with no limit, calling it ""pocket money.""  
  
Gradually, Edwin's relationship with her grew closer—while becoming more distant from me.  
  
Edwin even became indifferent to our son.  
  
Finally, one night when he was working late, Edwin went to the wrong home.  
  
I caught him at Ella's apartment.  
  
He collapsed on the floor, grabbed my hands, and begged me to hit him.  
  
""I'm sorry, Chloe. I was drunk. She didn't want to—I forced her...""  
  
""I promise this was just once. I won't see her again. When she graduates, I'll stop sponsoring her.""  
  
Then Ella got pregnant.  
  
I laughed mockingly. ""Edwin, can you tell me why you slept with her a year ago, but now she's eight months pregnant?""  
  
""Did I miss some new medical breakthrough where ovarian fertilization can be delayed by 2 to 4 months?""  
  
""Enough!""  
  
Faced with my questioning, Edwin interrupted sternly.  
  
""I'll explain these things to you later.""  
  
""What about Leo? Why didn't you bring him back? It's just diarrhea. Does he really need to stay in the hospital this long?""  
  
Thinking of my son, my heart felt like it was being hammered by thousands of iron hammers.  
  
I took out the folded documents from my bag—Leo's death certificate and our divorce papers.  
  
I collapsed on the floor, completely numb.  
  
""Cremation in three days.""  
  
""You should make time to say goodbye and sign the divorce papers.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Taking the certificate and agreement, Edwin's scrutinizing gaze fell on me.  
  
Suddenly, he couldn't help but laugh.  
  
""What perfect timing?""  
  
He let go, and the certificate and agreement fell at my feet.  
  
""Sorry, I didn't think diarrhea could actually kill someone.""  
  
""I know you're sad, but it's okay. Ella's child will be born in three days.""  
  
""She's grateful for my sponsorship and never takes it for granted. We've already agreed—once the child is born, we'll bring him home. You can raise him, just focus on being a good Mrs. Stone."" He paused. ""But there's one condition: you have to allow Ella to visit the baby often.""  
  
I was stunned.  
  
Then I slowly turned to him, dumbfounded—hardly believing what I'd just heard.  
  
""Edwin! How can you say such things? Are you crazy?""  
  
My voice was loud, waking Ella who was sleeping in the bedroom.  
  
Edwin looked impatient.  
  
""Keep it down. Ella is resting with the baby.""  
  
Slap!  
  
I raised my hand and slapped Edwin. He turned his head, his eyes cold.  
  
""Feeling better now?""  
  
""Don't make such jokes next time. How could anyone die from diarrhea? Aren't you afraid Leo will learn bad habits from you?""  
  
So Edwin didn't believe the death certificate.  
  
A wave of exhaustion washed over me. I picked up the divorce papers, walked to the coffee table, and signed my name.  
  
I put away the death certificate and reminded Edwin, ""Remember to sign.""  
  
Edwin opened his mouth as if to argue, but then his expression changed.  
  
The irritation on his face instantly disappeared.  
  
""Awake?""  
  
Ella came out of the master bedroom, her silk nightgown slipping off one shoulder.  
  
Her collarbone was covered with kiss marks.  
  
""Edwin, did you argue with Chloe?""  
  
She dramatically picked up the divorce papers, her widened eyes full of theatrical shock.  
  
""Chloe, are you really going to divorce Edwin?!""  
  
""Why? Is it because of me?""  
  
I looked at her with a cold smile. ""Yes, because you slept with a married man and got pregnant with his child, and because he dared to sleep with another woman while still wearing his wedding ring.""  
  
Ella's eyes filled with tears.  
  
She raised her hand, trying to cover those red kiss marks.  
  
""I'm sorry, Chloe, I... I didn't know it would cause such a big misunderstanding... I thought Edwin came to talk to me about his troubles.""  
  
I found it ridiculous.  
  
What troubles require abandoning your wife on your wedding anniversary to tell another woman?  
  
Edwin took his coat and considerately draped it over Ella's shoulders, not forgetting to comfort her: ""Don't mind her, her head isn't clear today.""  
  
I didn't want to waste more time with them. Ignoring the provocation in Ella's eyes, I walked into Leo's room and began packing his clothes.  
  
When I came out again, only Ella was left in the living room. She crumpled the paper in her hands into a ball and threw it at my feet.  
  
I immediately recognized it.  
  
Leo's death certificate.  
  
""Who gave you permission to go through my things?"" I looked at her coldly.  
  
She dramatically opened her mouth wide, but couldn't hide the joy in her eyes.  
  
""Chloe, did your son really die from diarrhea? That's so ridiculous, haha! Edwin was right—some children are just too fragile!"" She burst into laughter.  
  
I was shaking with anger. Without thinking, I rushed over and slapped her hard.  
  
She screamed, staggered backward, and collapsed on the floor.  
  
The next second, two slaps landed hard on me.  
  
Edwin picked up Ella, looking at me with pure hatred.  
  
""Chloe, you've gone too far!""  
  
Ella leaned weakly in his arms, tears streaming down her face.  
  
""I just asked about Leo's condition, and Chloe... I just suggested that Chloe shouldn't raise children to be so fragile, and shouldn't lie with the child. Edwin, what did I say wrong?""  
  
Edwin shook his head.  
  
""Chloe, Ella didn't say anything wrong. How did you become like this? This is the second time you've gotten physical with her. One more time, and we'll really get divorced!""  
  
With that, he carried Ella and strode out.  
  
I didn't want to get entangled with them anymore. I deliberately waited fifteen minutes before going downstairs with the packed luggage.  
  
Edwin had probably forgotten.  
  
I was a gentle person. As long as no one crossed my bottom line, I would never make things difficult for anyone, let alone hit them.  
  
The jewelry set from the auction was a wedding gift custom-made for me by a world-famous designer that Edwin had commissioned six years ago.  
  
Not just Edwin—probably everyone had forgotten that the Stone family and Holt family had always supported each other.  
  
Unfortunately, after that plane crash, the Holt family gradually crumbled into nothing.  
  
That jewelry set was made when Edwin knelt before my parents' grave, swearing to give me all the best and most perfect things, just as they had loved me.  
  
But six years later, he had long forgotten about the final payment for that jewelry. Due to the overdue payment, the designer had no choice but to put it up for auction.  
  
And I just wanted to get back what should have belonged to me, but Edwin froze my bank card.  
  
Because of that, I couldn't afford Leo's medicine—and he lost his chance to live.

Not sure if this is the right place for advice but it will make sense as you read.,"I am a 20 year old trans man, turning 21 next month. I came out at 17 and started my medical transition at 18. My mother and I were very close growing up. I only ever lived with her as she was a single mom and I was an only child. I spent a lot of time with family as well especially my dad’s side but never with my dad. Just a little background.


I moved out at 17 and live almost 2 hours away now. At first everything was fine, she liked my girlfriend and they seemed to get along. Then fast forward to my Top surgery. My mom was very weary of me getting it since she had a reduction and it grew back. I explained to her several times that it was not the same thing. Most of it felt like she just genuinely did not want me to transition. We moved past that and then came my surgery day. Her and my girlfriend took me to the hospital and when I went under, they went and drove around and got food. My mom then proceeded to cry to my girlfriend saying I was basically “dying” and she was loosing her daughter. I get it to an extent. She was sobbing and saying how she was going to turn the ring she had with my deadname on it into a coffin necklace and get a coffin tattoo with my deadname on it. Then I get out of surgery and she was going to stay with us for a couple days to help out. The night after my surgery my girlfriend had to work and only went because my mom was supposed to be with me all night. Apparently she had a hair appointment I did not know about, she said it would only take about an hour and she would be right back. She moved our coffee table right next to the couch so I could reach my meds and anything I would need. Fast forward about 4 hours and she still was not back. I needed to use the bathroom and walk around some. My girlfriend called her and asked why she had left me and when I was going to be back. My mom was very rude to her so my girlfriend hung up. I could not get up myself as I literally did not have the ability to move the coffee table out of my way. When my mom finally came back she started crying to me saying how we were “attacking her”. I told her I was not going to argue as I was exhausted and in pain. I don’t exactly remember what happened after that but I know she did end up leaving eventually after my girlfriend got home. Months went by and she never apologized. We sorta just moved past it even though me and my girlfriend were both very uncomfortable with it still. As time went on she would still mess up and call me the wrong name or pronouns even though even my extend family at this point had gotten it down. Even my little cousins. Whatever. Then about a year ago I proposed to my girlfriend who is now my fiancée. When I told my mom I was going to propose and showed her the ring all she had to say was “is it just an upgraded promise ring?” At this point me and my girlfriend have been together for 3 years. After I told her no, it’s an engagement ring, all she had to say was “❤️”. She showed no interest in our engagement or relationship. Now after this we would still go to visit her almost every weekend in the summer and fall. Everytime we would go up she would not have much to say to us and just sit on her phone and drink. She showed no interest in my fiancée anymore nor did she care to know anything about what was going on in our personal lives. All she would want to talk about is the newest and latest crazy expensive things her and her boyfriend of a year have purchased after she would complain to me how broke she was. She would also do weird ass things like sit on my lap or use me as her prop to tell inappropriate stories which made me and everyone else extremely uncomfortable. As if she just ignored that I am a guy. It felt like a weird ass play and she would only do stuff in front of my fiancee. After this we stopped going over there and I never knew how to bring it up to her as it makes me extremely uncomfortable even talking about it. Fast forward through the winter to this spring. We didn’t talk much at all. Still no interest in our lives or our upcoming wedding. Only her life. Then one day she texts me a picture of a ring that looks EXACTLY like my fiancées dream ring that I had purchased her and proposed to her with a year ago. My mom knows what my fiancées ring looks like. She has seen it multiple times but all she has ever said to my fiancée about her ring or anything to do with our wedding is “nice ring”. I asked if her boyfriend proposed to her and she said “no, buying the rings enough.” She had this ring custom made. CUSTOM MADE. My mom’s dream ring she has wanted forever looks nothing like this ring she “custom made” to look exactly like my fiancées ring. (Pear shaped ring for those wondering). I just ignored the pictures as I knew that was weird as hell and she never gave an inch about us getting engaged. My fiancee thought it was nuts as well. Fast forward about a month to my cousins graduation party. My mom was invited because I am extremely close to my dad’s side of the family and they always extend an invite to her as well. She shows up and sits next to my fiancee and shoves the ring in her face. She says “since *insert my name* didn’t ask or want to see it.” Finally after I am done getting my food I join them. We are having a decent conversation considering we haven’t talked really. Then all of a sudden she blows it into an argument and tells us we aren’t adults and we don’t know what we are doing and we should just move into her boyfriend’s house with her and give up our whole life for literally no reason at all? This lady knows nothing about our life. Genuinely we do not tell her anything. She misgenders me after 3 YEARS. She then calls my fiancee a bitch and storms off. Reminder we are literally at my little cousins grad party. She makes a huge scene and then makes go have a private conversation with her where she tells me we don’t care about her feelings and never come around. She never comes and visits us and expects us to drive 2 hours one way every weekend to see her when we work full time and have animals to take care of. She tells me my fiancee has always been disrespectful to her our whole relationship. My fiancee has never done anything disrespectful and hasn’t said anything to her about everything she has done to us. All she has ever wanted was for my mom to like her and have that MIL relationship most DIL’s have. She starts sobbing to me and says that we just hate her. This was about a month ago and I haven’t really talked to her because I am genuinely extremely hurt and extremely upset with her. I don’t know how to even talk to her about any of this because she will never listen. She flips it on us. She will not take accountability for anything. She has never once apologized for making us feel uncomfortable or saying that to my fiancee. I am at a lost and I don’t know if this is the right place to vent about this but none of this has started to happen until I came out and it amped up when I proposed to my fiancee. There is so much more I could add. I will reply to any questions because I know there is stuff I am missing but am I crazy and dramatic? Has anyone else had issues with a single parent acting this way? I don’t know where to go from here. She just refuses to treat me like her son and is so stuck on the fact that her “daughter died”. It makes me sick to think she thinks about it that extremely as well. It has affected my relationship and I need to come up with a solution. I will never leave my fiancee for my mom which is what my mom seems to want me to do which is absolutely crazy. She cannot get over the fact that I am an adult now and have a life. We live pretty “traditionally”. I’ve always wanted a wife and to have children and get married. She says she’s so accepting but has been pretty condescending since I have came out. Again I don’t know if this is the right place to vent about this or find answers. Mostly I just need to know if any other trans people have had similar experiences. It has made me grow to resent her and it’s to the point where I really don’t know if I want her to be apart of our wedding day. Thank you for reading if you made it this far.

# Yuumi, The Magical Cat

  
**Niche: Normals Zoner**  
Approachable Zoner that can keep people at a distance has special interactions with Assists. 

**Summary**  
Cheeky, Capricious, and Curious Yuumi is a cat through and through. She wants nothing more than to keep danger at an arms distance - Or at least approach it from behind someone dependable. But when her owner went missing, she found the courage to hunt for her across the globe. With the help of trusty Book she can open a portal anywhere in the world, and it helps that Book is sentient and intelligent enough to keep the cat on track and out of trouble.

**Gameplan**  
Keep away is the name of the game and Yuumi’s your cat. Pelt enemies with an assortment of projectiles from different angles, arcing, straight shots, anti-airs and even from behind. Her disjointed and ranged normals and specials means she has a great neutral game; allowing her to fish for stray hits and keep opponents on the backpedal, and frustrate approaches. Set up traps that catch your opponents off guard when they get too busy with your projectiles. Your assortment of ranged warfare makes you (and Book!) a great teammate for allies that may lack good ranged options. Speaking of assists Yuumi has special interactions with them to empower them meaning you will work especially well when you use them as often as possible to cover any gaps in your offense especially if an opponent manages to close the distance on you, of course you can always use your teleport to recreate space but who doesn’t love a big body coming to their rescue?

**Visuals:**   
Yuumi the Cat and Book make up a singular fighter body for hitbox, movement and combat. Book floats low to the ground and Yuumi floats just above Book. Both “characters” participate in movement and combat actions, and remain in close proximity to each other.

**Control Scheme**  
Yuumi and Book are effectively two characters, who share the same body and hitbox. They never fully separate from each other and always float in close proximity to each other regardless of if they make “independent movements”. They are always intrinsically linked together (for gameplay purposes). If Yuumi is “attached” to a Teammate she and Book may be slightly reduced in size visually as they float behind their teammates shoulder. Yuumi cannot input normal movement commands to control her own movement and is untargetable while Attached.

# Passive Mechanics: 

**Calling** **an Assist:** Yuumi can choose to dash to the assist champion’s location while they remain on the screen as a function of one of her Special Moves. Once nearby Yuumi will **Attach** to ride on that champion’s shoulder while they remain on screen.

**Called** **as an Assist:** Yuumi will dash to the Player Champion to **Attach** before performing her assist action. Yuumi will remain floating on the Player Champion’s shoulder at the end of the Assist action for a duration, which can be increased if her Call Assist action was charged by the Player Champion.

1lmblhc,https://youtu.be/ACgBetyCneY,3 Very Scary TRUE School Bus Horror Stories,"# ""The Hatch Above Us"":

I was 10 years old, sitting near the back of the yellow school bus, my backpack wedged between my knees, stuffed with books, a crumpled lunch bag, and a notebook filled with doodles. It was July 15, 1976, in Chowchilla, California. We’d spent the day at a summer program, splashing in the community pool and eating hot dogs at the fairgrounds. The bus was alive with noise—kids laughing, shouting, some singing off-key songs about summer. I was staring out the window, watching fields blur by, thinking about my dog, Rusty, waiting for me at home. Emily, my best friend, was next to me, braiding a friendship bracelet with bright pink thread.

The bus slowed down, the engine’s hum softening. I glanced up, curious. “Why’re we stopping?” Emily whispered, her fingers pausing on the bracelet. I shrugged, leaning forward to see. A white van was parked sideways across the narrow road, blocking our path. Mr. Ray, our driver, a kind man with graying hair and a soft voice, leaned over the steering wheel, squinting. “Stay seated, kids,” he said, but his words sounded tight, like he was holding his breath.

Three men stepped out of the van. My stomach dropped. Their faces were covered with nylon stockings, stretched so tight their eyes looked like dark, hollow pits. One held a rifle, its long barrel catching the light. The other two had shotguns, gripped tightly in their gloved hands. My heart started pounding, a loud thump in my ears. This wasn’t a game. This was real.

“Everyone, stay calm,” Mr. Ray said, his hands trembling as he raised them slightly. His voice shook, and I could see sweat beading on his forehead. The man with the rifle climbed onto the bus, his boots thudding on the steps. “Get up! Move! Now!” he shouted, waving the gun toward the door. The other two stood behind him, silent but menacing, their weapons trained on us. I grabbed Emily’s hand, her palm cold and sweaty. She was shaking, her eyes wide with fear.

We stumbled off the bus, all 26 of us kids, ages 5 to 14, tripping over backpacks and each other. A little girl in pigtails was crying, clutching a stuffed rabbit. “I want my mom,” she whimpered. “Quiet!” one of the men snapped, shoving her forward. I wanted to comfort her, but my own legs felt like they might give out.

They herded us into two vans parked nearby. The windows were painted black, and the insides were lined with thick, gray paneling that smelled like glue and dust. It was like stepping into a box with no light, no air. They split us up, pushing me, Emily, and about a dozen others into one van. Mr. Ray was shoved in with us. The door slammed shut, and the lock clicked, loud and final. I felt like I couldn’t breathe, the air already heavy with panic.

“Where are they taking us?” Emily whispered, her voice barely audible over the van’s engine. I shook my head, my throat too tight to answer. A boy across from me, maybe 7, was hugging his knees, rocking back and forth. “I don’t wanna die,” he mumbled. Mr. Ray reached over, putting a hand on his shoulder. “We’re gonna be okay,” he said, but his eyes didn’t match his words. They were wide, darting around the dark van.

The ride felt like forever. I tried to keep track of the turns—left, right, left again—but the twists and bumps made it impossible. The van was hot, the air stale. Someone was sniffling. Another kid was praying under their breath. I pressed my face against the painted window, hoping to see something, anything, but it was just black. My mind raced with horrible thoughts. Were they going to hurt us? Would we ever see our families again?

After what felt like hours, the van stopped. The door slid open, and one of the men grabbed my arm, yanking me out. We were in a rocky, dusty place, surrounded by low hills. A large hole gaped in the ground, and next to it was a buried truck trailer, its top barely visible above the dirt. A ladder led down into it. “Get in!” one of the men shouted, pushing us toward the hole. My legs shook as I climbed down, the metal rungs cold under my hands. Emily was right behind me, her breath hitching.

Inside, the trailer was dark and damp, the air thick with the smell of wet earth and rust. Old mattresses were scattered across the floor, some torn and stained. A few cans of peaches and a jug of water sat in a corner, next to a bucket that made my stomach churn when I realized what it was for. The walls were metal, scratched and dented, closing in around us. There were 26 of us kids, plus Mr. Ray, crammed into this tiny space, barely 8 feet by 16 feet.

The men climbed up the ladder and slammed a heavy hatch shut above us. I heard loud thumps—something heavy being piled on top. “Batteries,” Jodi, a 14-year-old boy with messy brown hair, whispered. He was one of the older kids, always quiet but smart. “They’re weighing it down so we can’t get out.”

Darkness swallowed us. The only sounds were kids crying and the faint creak of the trailer. My chest felt tight, like the walls were pressing in. I sat on a mattress, pulling my knees up, trying to stay calm. Emily was next to me, her head on my shoulder. “What if they leave us here forever?” she whispered. I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

“Mr. Ray, what’s gonna happen?” a girl asked, her voice small. She was holding the stuffed rabbit girl, trying to keep her calm.

“We’ll find a way,” Mr. Ray said, kneeling beside them. “We just need to stay strong, okay?” But his hands were clenched into fists, and I could tell he was as scared as we were.

Hours passed. Maybe it was minutes, but it felt like forever. The air grew thicker, harder to breathe. Some kids fell asleep, their heads resting on the lumpy mattresses. Others sat silently, staring into the dark. My fingers traced the rough edge of the mattress, trying to focus on something, anything, to keep the panic away. But every sound—a creak, a rustle—made my heart jump. Were the men coming back? Were they watching us?

Then Jodi spoke, his voice low but steady. “We can’t wait for them to decide what happens. We have to get out.” He stood up, feeling along the walls, testing the hatch above us. “It’s heavy, but we can do this. We have to.”

Mr. Ray nodded. “He’s right. Let’s try.” He started moving mattresses, stacking them under the hatch to make a platform. Jodi climbed up, pushing against the hatch with his shoulder. It didn’t budge. “It’s those batteries,” he said, his voice tense. “They’re too heavy.”

I crawled over, my hands shaking, and started digging at the dirt around the hatch’s edges. The ground was hard, packed tight, and my nails tore as I clawed at it. Emily joined me, her fingers scraping alongside mine. “Keep going,” she whispered, her voice hoarse. My hands were raw, blood mixing with the dirt, but I didn’t stop. None of us did.

Other kids helped, passing chunks of dirt back, clearing a path. A little boy handed me a broken piece of wood from the trailer’s floor, and I used it to dig faster. Every minute felt like an hour. My arms burned, and my lungs stung from the dust. “What if they hear us?” a girl whispered, her eyes darting to the hatch.

“They won’t,” Jodi said, but he didn’t sound sure. He was pushing harder now, grunting with effort. Mr. Ray climbed up beside him, adding his weight. The hatch creaked, just a little. My heart leapt. “It’s moving!” I said, my voice louder than I meant.

“Shh!” Jodi hissed, glancing around like the men might appear out of the dark. We worked faster, digging, pushing, praying. The dirt piled up around us, sticking to our sweaty faces. My fingers were numb, but I kept going, fueled by fear and hope.

Then, a rush of cool air hit my face. The hatch lifted, just an inch at first, then wider. Jodi and Mr. Ray shoved with everything they had, and it opened enough for a small kid to slip through. “Go, go!” Mr. Ray whispered, lifting the youngest kids up. I helped push them, my hands slippery with sweat and blood.

One by one, we climbed out, scrambling into the open. The quarry was quiet, the ground rough under my sneakers. I looked around, half-expecting the men to be waiting, guns raised. But there was nothing—just rocks and shadows. We ran, all of us, toward a small building in the distance, a guard shack glowing faintly with light.

My legs felt like they might collapse, but I kept going, Emily’s hand in mine. Mr. Ray was at the back, making sure no one was left behind. The guard inside the shack jumped when we burst in, his coffee spilling. “Help us!” Mr. Ray shouted. “Call the police!”

The guard fumbled for his phone, his eyes wide as he took in our dirty faces, torn clothes, and bloody hands. “What happened to you kids?” he asked, already dialing.

Soon, police cars screeched up, their lights cutting through the dark. Paramedics wrapped us in blankets, checking our cuts and bruises. My parents found me, their arms squeezing me so tight I could barely breathe. I cried then, the fear finally spilling out.

We were safe, but the terror of that trailer stayed with me. For years, I’d wake up gasping, feeling like I was back in that dark, damp hole, the walls closing in. I’d check my windows at night, afraid of seeing a face behind a stocking mask. We survived, but the fear clung to us, a shadow we couldn’t outrun.





# ""The Long Ride Home"":

I was 14, sprawled across a worn seat on the church bus, my sneakers scuffing the floor, still buzzing from a day at King’s Island. The amusement park’s roller coasters, bright lights, and cotton candy sweetness felt like a dream now. My best friend Tom slouched beside me, his head pressed against the window, eyelids drooping. The bus was packed with 66 of us—kids from our youth group, a few adults, all tired but content. The air smelled of old vinyl seats and the faint tang of sweat. Kids in the back were giggling, swapping stories about the rides, while others dozed, heads bobbing with the hum of the engine.

“Jake, you think the Beast was scarier than the Vortex?” Tom asked, his voice sleepy, one eye cracking open.

I grinned, nudging him. “Vortex had us spinning like tops. You screamed so loud I thought you’d wake the dead.”

“Did not,” he shot back, shoving my shoulder. His laugh was warm, familiar, like we’d done this a hundred times. We had—best friends since we were six, always together. I leaned back, the seat creaking under me, and watched the highway lights flicker past outside. The bus was cozy, safe, like a cocoon carrying us home.

Mrs. Carter, our chaperone, walked the aisle, her sneakers squeaking on the floor. She was in her 40s, with a kind smile and a clipboard she always carried. “Get some rest, boys,” she said, pausing by us. “It’s a long ride back to Radcliff.”

“Yes, ma’am,” I said, giving her a mock salute. Tom chuckled, and she shook her head, moving on to check on the younger kids. A girl across the aisle was braiding her friend’s hair, whispering about some crush. In the back, a group started singing a hymn, soft and off-key. I closed my eyes, letting the rhythm of the bus lull me. I was almost asleep when it happened.

A deafening bang—like a bomb going off—ripped through the air. The bus lurched violently, throwing me hard against the seat in front. My forehead smacked the metal bar, and pain shot through my skull. Screams exploded around me, high and panicked. The bus tilted, tires screeching, and I grabbed Tom’s arm, my fingers digging into his sleeve.

“What was that?” I gasped, my voice shaking. My heart pounded so hard it hurt.

Tom’s eyes were wide, his face pale in the dim light. “We hit something! Or something hit us!”

The bus skidded, metal grinding against metal, and came to a jarring stop. The floor was slanted, like we were on a hill. I smelled it first—gasoline, sharp and sour, stinging my nose. Then smoke. Thick, black smoke poured in from the front, curling like fingers through the air. My eyes burned, and I coughed, my throat tightening.

“Everyone, stay calm!” Mrs. Carter’s voice cut through the chaos. “Get to the back door, now!”

I scrambled to my feet, my legs wobbly. The smoke was so thick I could barely see Tom’s face, just inches away. Kids were screaming, coughing, stumbling over seats. Then I saw it—orange flickers at the front, growing brighter. Fire. It was spreading fast, licking up the seats, eating the curtains. The heat hit me like a wave, prickling my skin.

“Tom, move!” I grabbed his hand, pulling him into the aisle. People were already rushing toward the back, tripping over bags and each other. The air was hot, heavy, like breathing in an oven. My chest ached with every breath, and the smoke stung my eyes until tears streamed down my face.

“Jake, my leg!” Tom’s voice cracked, desperate. I looked down. His right leg was trapped, wedged under the seat where it had crumpled in the crash. The metal was bent, pinning him like a trap. He yanked at it, his hands shaking, but it wouldn’t budge.

“Hold on!” I dropped to my knees, my fingers fumbling at the jagged metal. It was sharp, cutting into my palms, but I didn’t care. The fire was louder now, a low roar, and the flames were closer, crawling up the walls. The heat pressed against my back, and sweat dripped into my eyes. Screams filled the air—kids calling for help, for their parents, their voices raw with fear.

“Jake, it’s stuck!” Tom said, his face twisted in pain. “You gotta go!”

“No!” I shouted, pulling harder. My hands were slick with blood, and the metal wouldn’t move. The smoke was thicker, a gray wall that hid everything beyond a few feet. I could hear Mrs. Carter at the back, her voice hoarse, yelling, “One at a time! Don’t push!” But the panic was too strong. People were shoving, climbing over each other to reach the rear door.

I glanced back. The door was open, but it was chaos—a bottleneck of bodies, arms flailing, kids crying. Something blocked the exit, maybe a bag or a broken seat, making the gap too small. The flames were halfway down the bus now, the heat so intense my skin felt like it was blistering. The hymn-singers had stopped. All I heard were screams and the crackle of fire.

“Tom, I’ll get you out!” I said, my voice breaking. I yanked at the seat again, my muscles burning, but it was no use. His face was pale, sweat beading on his forehead. He grabbed my arm, his grip weak.

“Jake, go,” he whispered. “Please. I’ll be okay.”

I shook my head, tears mixing with the sweat on my face. “I’m not leaving you!” But the fire was closer, the smoke so thick I could barely breathe. My lungs felt like they were collapsing. A girl nearby screamed, her voice cut off by a cough. I looked at Tom, his eyes pleading, and I hated myself for what I was about to do.

“I’ll get help,” I choked out, stumbling to my feet. My heart felt like it was being ripped apart. I pushed through the aisle, the floor slick with spilled soda and who-knows-what. The crowd at the door was a wall, people shoving, some falling. I couldn’t get through. My eyes darted around, desperate. Then I saw it—a window to my left, cracked, the glass spiderwebbed from the crash. The firelight glinted off the shards.

I climbed onto a seat, my sneakers slipping on the vinyl. With all my strength, I slammed my elbow against the window. It shattered, glass cutting into my hands and arms. Blood ran down my wrists, warm and sticky, but I didn’t stop. I punched out the remaining shards, making a hole just big enough. The air outside hit my face—cool, clean, a shock after the smoke. I crawled through, the glass scraping my stomach and legs, and fell onto the grass outside.

I hit the ground hard, my hands stinging, blood dripping into the dirt. I turned back, and my breath caught. The bus was a monster, engulfed in flames, the windows glowing orange. Smoke poured out, black and thick, curling into the sky. The screams from inside were louder, sharper—kids trapped, banging on the windows, their faces blurred by smoke and fire. My stomach twisted, and I screamed, “Tom!” My voice was lost in the roar of the flames.

I ran toward the back door, my legs shaking. I could see people still trying to get out, but the fire was too fast. Hands grabbed me—strong, rough hands. A man in a trucker hat, his face grim, pulled me back. “Stay away, kid! It’s too dangerous!”

“I have to get Tom!” I yelled, fighting against him. My arms were weak, my hands slick with blood. Another man joined him, holding me as I kicked and screamed. The bus was an inferno now, the heat so intense it burned my face even from yards away. The screams inside were fading, replaced by the crackle of fire and the groan of melting metal. My knees gave out, and I sank to the ground, staring as the flames swallowed everything.

Sirens wailed, growing closer. Red and blue lights flashed, cutting through the dark. Firefighters and paramedics appeared, shouting orders, pulling people away. I saw a few kids stumble out, coughing, their faces black with soot. But not enough. Not nearly enough. The trucker held my shoulder, his voice low. “You did what you could, son. You got out.”

I shook my head, tears streaming down my face. I didn’t do enough. I left Tom. My best friend, who’d laughed with me hours ago, who’d shared his fries at the park. I left him in that fire.

They took me to the hospital, the ambulance ride a blur of flashing lights and beeping machines. The smell of antiseptic stung my nose as a nurse cleaned the cuts on my hands and arms, stitching up the deepest ones. My skin was raw, covered in bandages, but the pain didn’t compare to the ache in my chest. The hospital was chaos—crying parents, doctors rushing, kids with burns and broken bones. The nurse, a woman with gray streaks in her hair, sat by my bed.

“You’re lucky,” she said, her voice gentle but firm. “You made it out alive.”

“Lucky?” I whispered, my voice hoarse from smoke. The word felt like a lie. I saw Tom’s face every time I closed my eyes—his wide eyes, his hand reaching for me. I heard the screams, smelled the gasoline, felt the heat. Twenty-seven people didn’t make it that night. Kids I’d known for years, adults who’d planned our trip, Mrs. Carter with her kind smile. Tom was one of them. They told me later a drunk driver caused it—a man who’d had too much to drink, driving the wrong way, not caring who he hurt.

I stayed in the hospital for days, my hands wrapped in gauze, my dreams filled with fire and screams. When I got out, I went to the memorial, standing in silence as names were read. Tom’s name hit me like a punch. I saw his mom, her eyes red, clutching a photo of him. I wanted to tell her I tried, that I didn’t want to leave him, but the words wouldn’t come.

Now, years later, I still wake up at night, my heart racing, my hands reaching for someone who’s not there. The scars on my arms are faint, but the ones inside are deep, raw, like wounds that never heal. I speak at schools, telling kids about that night—the crash, the fire, the screams. I tell them about Tom, how he was brave, how he told me to go. I tell them about drunk driving, how one person’s choice can destroy so many lives. It’s the only way I can keep going, the only way I can make sense of the horror. I carry Tom with me, every day, hoping my words might stop another bus from burning, another friend from being left behind.

  


# ""Bus 17"":

I was 12, a seventh-grader, trudging through the school parking lot to the yellow bus parked at the curb. The seats were sticky, the kind of vinyl that squeaked when you slid in, and the air smelled like old lunch bags and pencil shavings. I plopped into my usual spot, third row from the front, window side, where I could watch the world blur by. My friend Jake flopped down next to me, already fiddling with his Game Boy, the tinny music barely audible over the chatter of the other kids. There were 13 of us on the bus, from little second-graders to a couple of eighth-graders, all piling in after a long day of math tests and gym class. Mr. Nuss, our driver, sat up front, adjusting his faded baseball cap. He was older, maybe 60, with a quiet way about him, always staring straight ahead. Today, though, his hands seemed to grip the steering wheel a little too hard, his knuckles pale. I didn’t think much of it at first. Just another ride home.

The engine growled as we pulled out of the lot. Kids were loud—yelling about a dodgeball game, tossing crumpled paper, giggling over some joke. I pressed my forehead against the cool window, watching familiar houses roll by, their porches cluttered with bikes and flowerpots. But after a few minutes, something felt wrong. We passed the corner store, the one with the neon ice cream sign where we always turned left toward my neighborhood. Mr. Nuss kept going straight. The road stretched into a two-lane highway, lined with scraggly trees and not much else. My stomach gave a little lurch. I nudged Jake. “He missed the turn.”

Jake glanced up, his Game Boy screen glowing green. “Huh? Maybe it’s a detour or something.”

But the houses were gone now. No more stop signs, no more kids on scooters. Just the hum of the tires and the endless road. I raised my hand, like I was in class, my voice shaky. “Mr. Nuss? Where are we going? You passed my street.”

He didn’t turn around. His voice came out flat, too calm, like he was reading a script. “Special field trip today. You kids are gonna see something important.”

Field trip? My heart thudded. We didn’t have field trips on random Thursday afternoons. No permission slips, no announcements. Jake leaned forward, his voice louder. “Mr. Nuss, my mom’s waiting for me. She’ll be mad if I’m late. Can you take us back?”

“Sit down, son,” Mr. Nuss snapped, sharper than I’d ever heard him. “We’re going somewhere you need to see.”

Whispers rippled through the bus. Little Emma, a second-grader with pigtails, sat in the front row, clutching her backpack. Her eyes were wide, and she started sniffling. Her brother, Tim, a fifth-grader across the aisle, leaned over to shush her, but his face was pale, his hands fidgeting. Rachel, an eighth-grader who always acted tough, stood up in the back. “This isn’t funny, Mr. Nuss. You can’t just drive us somewhere without telling our parents.”

He glanced at her in the rearview mirror, his eyes narrow. “Sit down, young lady. You’ll thank me later.”

I looked around, hoping someone would know what to do. The younger kids were quiet now, their laughter gone. My eyes caught something on the dashboard—a stack of maps, unfolded, with red pen scribbled over them, circling places I couldn’t read from my seat. Next to the maps was a jacket, lumpy, draped over something long and narrow. My breath hitched. The shape was unmistakable. A rifle. My hands went cold, like I’d plunged them into ice water.

“Jake,” I whispered, my voice barely a sound. I pointed at the dashboard. “Do you see that?”

He followed my gaze, and his Game Boy slipped from his hands, clattering onto the seat. “Is that… a gun?” he mouthed, his eyes huge.

My heart was pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat. I wanted to yell, to run, but we were trapped in this moving box, the doors locked, the windows too high to jump from. The bus radio crackled, the dispatcher’s voice faint. “Bus 17, report your location.” Mr. Nuss didn’t touch it. He just kept driving, his jaw tight, his eyes fixed on the road. A sign flashed by: “Maryland 50 miles.” Maryland? We lived in Pennsylvania. My house was 10 minutes from school, not another state. My stomach churned, and I felt like I might throw up.

“Mr. Nuss!” Rachel tried again, standing despite his warning. “This is kidnapping! You have to take us home!”

He didn’t answer at first. Then, in that same creepy, calm voice, he said, “I’m showing you the truth. About what happened last year. The towers. You kids need to understand.”

The towers? 9/11? My mind spun. That was months ago, planes crashing, people dying. What did that have to do with us? Was he angry? Crazy? I glanced at the rifle again, the jacket slipping slightly, showing more of the black barrel. Was it loaded? Would he use it if we tried to stop him? My legs felt like jelly, and my hands were shaking so bad I shoved them under my thighs.

Tim leaned across the aisle, his voice low. “We gotta do something. Emma’s freaking out. She’s only seven.”

“What can we do?” I whispered back. “He’s driving. He’s got a gun.”

Jake’s voice was trembling. “Maybe the radio? We could call for help.”

I looked at the radio, mounted just above the dashboard. It crackled again. “Bus 17, this is dispatch. Where are you?” Mr. Nuss reached over and turned it off, his fingers twitching. My heart sank. Even if we got to it, he’d see us. And that rifle was right there.

Hours dragged on. The bus hummed along unfamiliar highways, the signs counting down to Maryland. Emma’s sniffles turned into soft sobs, and Tim hugged her, whispering, “It’s okay, it’s okay,” but his voice shook. Rachel kept pacing in the back, muttering to the older kids, but no one had a plan. I kept staring at the rifle, imagining it in his hands, pointed at us. What did he want? To hurt us? To keep us forever? My throat was so dry I could barely swallow.

Finally, the bus slowed, pulling into a gas station. Mr. Nuss turned to us, his eyes scanning every face. “Stay in your seats. I’m getting food. Don’t try anything.” He grabbed the keys and stepped out, locking the door behind him. The rifle stayed on the dashboard, taunting us.

Rachel rushed to the front, banging on the door. “Help! Somebody!” But the parking lot was nearly empty, just a couple of trucks and a guy pumping gas who didn’t look our way. Tim grabbed a pencil from his bag and scribbled “911” backwards on the foggy window, his hands shaking so bad the numbers were wobbly. “Maybe someone’ll see it,” he said, but his voice was hopeless.

Emma was crying harder now. “I want my mom,” she kept saying, her voice breaking my heart. I wanted my mom too, wanted to be in my kitchen, eating cereal, not stuck here, wondering if I’d ever get home. The fear was like a heavy blanket, suffocating me.

Mr. Nuss came back with paper bags of burgers and fries, tossing them onto the seats. “Eat,” he said, like we were on a picnic. “You’ll need it for the trip.” His smile was wrong, too wide, like he was trying to be nice but didn’t know how. The smell of the food made my stomach turn. I couldn’t eat, not with that rifle staring at me, not with his words about “the truth” echoing in my head.

“Where are you taking us?” I asked, my voice so quiet I wasn’t sure he’d hear.

“Washington,” he said, starting the engine. “To see what they don’t want you to know.”

Washington, D.C.? That was hours away, a place I’d only seen on TV. My mind filled with awful pictures—us lost in some dark place, no one knowing where we were. Jake grabbed my arm. “He’s nuts,” he whispered. “What if he never lets us go?”

“Don’t say that,” I hissed, but the thought was already in my head, growing bigger every second. The bus rolled on, the road signs a blur. Maryland now, the signs said. No one was coming. No one knew.

At another stop, a small diner with flickering lights, Mr. Nuss let us out to use the bathroom. “Stay close,” he said, his hand resting on his coat pocket. I wondered if he had another gun there, something smaller. Inside, the diner smelled like coffee and grease. I tried to catch the waitress’s eye, a tired-looking woman wiping tables. I wanted to scream, “He’s kidnapping us!” but Mr. Nuss was right behind me, his shadow looming. I washed my hands, my heart pounding, and whispered to Jake, “We have to tell someone.”

“How?” he said. “He’s watching us like a hawk.”

Back on the bus, the younger kids were silent now, their faces pale, their eyes red. Rachel whispered to us, “If we all rush him, maybe we can grab the keys.”

“With a rifle?” Tim snapped, his voice low. “He’d shoot us before we got close.”

I felt like I was drowning, like the air was too thick to breathe. The radio crackled again, louder. “Bus 17, this is an emergency. Report your location now!” Mr. Nuss slammed it off, his face twitching. Was he scared? Angry? I couldn’t tell, and that made it worse.

More hours passed, the bus a prison on wheels. My legs cramped, my back ached, but the fear was worse than any pain. I kept imagining my parents, wondering where I was, calling the school, the police. Would they find us? Or would we disappear, like in those stories you hear on the news?

Finally, the bus slowed. Flashing lights appeared ahead—red and blue, cutting through the dark. Police cars, three of them, blocking the road. My heart leapt, hope and fear crashing together. Mr. Nuss pulled over, his hands tight on the wheel. “Stay seated,” he said, his voice flat. He stepped out, hands raised, talking to an officer. We watched, barely breathing. The rifle was still there, under the jacket. What if he ran back for it?

But he didn’t. More officers surrounded the bus, their voices sharp but calm. “Kids, you’re safe now,” one called through the door. They pried it open, and we stumbled out, legs wobbly, air cold on our faces. Emma ran to a cop, sobbing into his jacket. Tim followed, hugging her. I looked back at Mr. Nuss, his hands cuffed, his face blank, like he didn’t even see us anymore.

Later, at the police station, they told us he’d turned himself in, said he wanted to “show us the truth” about 9/11, something about the government and the towers. He was sick, they said, off his medicine, not thinking right. He had a loaded rifle, 93 bullets, but he hadn’t hurt us. We were lucky, they kept saying.

We got home that night, my mom hugging me so tight I could barely breathe. But I didn’t sleep. I kept seeing that rifle, hearing his voice, feeling the bus moving farther from home. Even now, I check the driver’s face every time I get on a bus, just to be sure it’s not him. I don’t think I’ll ever feel safe again.",1,1751076660.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I caught my husband cheating – right in my best friend's bed.  
  
There was my husband Milo Harrison, who couldn’t get it up for three years, desperately pounding my best friend Gina Reed.  
  
I whipped out my phone and snapped their fucking from every conceivable angle.  
  
Then I packaged the whole collection and sent to Gina's husband.  
  
Along with a sweet message: \[Congratulations, Oliver! Your wife's a genius healer! She juet cure my husband's impotence!\]  
  
""Well, honey, how's your impotence sure cleared up this fast?""  
  
I leaned against the doorframe with a sickeningly sweet tone.  
  
The two naked bodies on the bed instantly froze.  
  
My husband Milo looked at me like he'd seen a ghost, stammering without getting a single word out.  
  
My dear friend Gina was quicker on the uptake – she grabbed the sheets and wrapped them around herself.  
  
""Rita... we can...""  
  
""Don't rush to explain."" I pulled out my phone.  
  
""Let me get a picture first. This is the first time in three years of marriage I've seen my husband's dick this... perky.""  
  
Milo threw off the covers and lunged for my phone. I nearly got blinded by his swinging penis.  
  
""Whoa there, honey, easy does it. Why so worked up? It's not like I haven't seen it before.""  
  
I stepped back.  
  
""Oh wait, actually I haven't seen it like THIS – since you've been keeping your V-card for my bestie this three years. How thoughtful of you.""  
  
Gina's cheeks flushed red: ""Rita, let me explain. This isn't what you think.""  
  
I smiled at her: ""Explain what? You sacrificed yourself to cure my husband's ED. I should be kissing your feet in gratitude?""  
  
""You two go on. I'll just call Oliver Harrison and have him come watch his wife's sexy performance.""  
  
Gina's face went ghost white.  
  
She was Milo's brother‘s wife, my sister-in-law, and my best friend.  
  
Ah, What a fucking mess of relationships.  
  
""You wouldn't dare!"" Milo roared.  
  
I raised an eyebrow: ""You did it. Why the hell wouldn't I?""  
  
Gina suddenly threw herself at my legs.  
  
""Rita, please, don't tell Oliver. I know I screwed up.""  
  
Looking at my childhood friend, now half-naked and clinging to my legs, I suddenly found it ridiculious.  
  
""Gina, get up first.""  
  
I bent down and patted her shoulder: ""The floor's cold.""  
  
She looked up at me hopefully.  
  
I continued: ""With that pitiful face, you’re gonna break my husband’s heart.""  
  
Then I turned to leave, and Milo grabbed my arm.  
  
""What are you trying to do? You want to destroy our family?""  
  
I clenched my fists, smiling sweetly.  
  
What a shameless thing to say.  
  
""I need to go to the hospital for some tests to figure out why my husband is impotent with me but fucks everyone else so hard.""  
  
Milo's face turned bright red: ""Rita Collins, cut the sarcasm!""  
  
""Ohoh, calm down."" I held up my phone.  
  
""Want to see the photos I just took? Great composition, angles, lighting – they'd probably go viral on tiktok.""  
  
Gina lunged for my phone, but I dodged.  
  
I grinned: ""Oh, should I add a caption? How about 'My Husband and Best Friend's Sweet Moments'?""  
  
""You—!"" Gina was shaking with rage.  
  
Just then, my phone rang. Oliver's call.  
  
I hit speakerphone: ""Hey, Oliver.""  
  
""I'm downstairs. What's the apartment number?""  
  
Oliver's deep voice filled the room.  
  
Gina's pupils contracted, her whole body visibly trembling.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Footsteps echoed from the hallway.  
  
I leisurely leaned on my chair and pulled out my phone, hitting record.  
  
Oliver pushed through the door, his face stone-cold as he scanned the room.  
  
His gaze swept over half-naked Gina, then locked onto his panicked brother's face.  
  
""Bro...""  
  
Milo's voice was shaking like crazy.  
  
Oliver said nothing, just turned to me: ""You recording this?""  
  
I blinked, then quickly nodded like a good student: ""Yep.""  
  
Gina collapsed to the floor, tears streaming down her face.  
  
""Honey, this isn't what you think...""  
  
""Shut up.""  
  
Two simple words, but Gina clammed up like someone had grabbed her by the throat.  
  
I sat there watching this unfold, feeling weirdly detached from it all.  
  
I'm the one who got betrayed. I should be the most devastated person here.  
  
But instead, I sat there like a spectator, coldly watching this whole shitshow unfold.  
  
""Both of you, get dressed. Now."" Oliver's voice was ice-cold.  
  
Watching them scramble into their clothes, I almost wanted to laugh.  
  
This whole scene felt like a trashy TV drama.  
  
Once they were decent, Oliver grabbed Milo and landed two solid punches across his face.  
  
Then came a brutal knee to the gut. I watched Milo double over, clutching himself, his lips going white.  
  
After years of faking impotence, looks like he might actually achieve it now.  
  
My brother-in-law always seemed so refined and gentle. Who knew he could get this savage when pissed.  
  
After Milo hit the floor, Oliver finally spoke: ""Spill it. How long?""  
  
No one answered.  
  
""I asked you how fucking long!"" Oliver roared.  
  
Even I jumped.  
  
Gina sobbed: ""Three... three years...""  
  
Three years.  
  
Exactly how long Milo and I had been married.  
  
So he'd been lying to me from day one.  
  
All those excuses, all that bullshit about his ""condition"" – pure lies.  
  
I spoke up, my voice dripping with sarcasm:  
  
""So you two are true love? Started before Milo and I even got married?""  
  
Milo kept his head down.  
  
""Look up! Look at us when we're talking to you!"" Oliver bellowed again.  
  
Milo slowly raised his head, eyes full of terror: ""Oliver... I...""  
  
""Don't call my name!"" Oliver's voice was pure rage.  
  
""You're not my brother, you're a fucking bastard.""  
  
Milo went pale as a ghost.  
  
Gina suddenly dropped to her knees: ""Honey, I'm sorry... I really know I screwed up...""  
  
I added: ""You know you screwed up, or you're just scared now?""  
  
If I hadn't caught them, who knows how long they would've kept us wearing these green hats.  
  
I stood up and faced Oliver: ""Got everything on video. Let's go – this place is disgusting.""  
  
Oliver nodded and turned to leave.  
  
""Wait! Don't go!"" Milo panicked and dropped to his knees.  
  
I turned back with the sweetest smile:  
  
""Stay for what? Watch you and your sister-in-law go for round two?""  
  
""Besides, you want to be with your brother's wife so badly – we're doing you a favor.""  
  
""No! Honey, we can't get divorced!"" Gina shrieked.  
  
Oliver was more successful than my husband, never let her want for money. Now she probably couldn't bear to give that up.  
  
Guess compared to Milo's love, she cared more about Oliver's bank account.  
  
""You're always working, I got so lonely and made this stupid mistake. Please forgive me just this once, I swear I'll never see him again, please?""  
  
Gina looked absolutely heartbroken, even I felt a little sorry for this ‘poor beauty’.  
  
But Oliver didn't even glance her way.  
  
""No way.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
""You bitch! Get your ass out here!""  
  
Bright and early in the morning, there was screaming and wailing coming from the company lobby.  
  
I was in my office drinking coffee when a colleague told me Gina's mom had come looking for trouble. I nearly spit out my coffee.  
  
This plot development is so melodramatic.  
  
""Rita Collins, you shameless homewrecker! Seducing my son-in-law and destroying my daughter's marriage – do you have any fucking shame left!""  
  
Gina's mother had serious lung power, standing at the reception desk acting on a whole dramatic show.  
  
My colleague Kevin rushed over: ""Rita, Gina Reed's mom is downstairs causing a scene, saying you seduced her son-in-law...""  
  
I leisurely set down my coffee cup: ""Oh, well then I better go see this.""  
  
When I got to the lobby, Gina's mom was wiping away tears while trashing me to anyone who'd listen.  
  
""Everyone listen up! This woman was so jealous that my daughter married into a rich family, so she had to stick her nose in and wreck my daughter's perfect family!""  
  
I leaned against the reception counter, grinning as I watched this comedy show.  
  
The receptionist looked relieved when she saw me: ""Mrs. Reed, Manager Collins is here.""  
  
Gina's mom whipped around, getting even more pissed when she saw how relaxed I looked: ""Well look who finally dares to show her face!""  
  
""Why wouldn't I?"" I raised an eyebrow.  
  
""Should I hide like some people do after they get caught doing nasty shit?""  
  
Gina's mom's face turned bright red.  
  
""Stop twisting the facts! My daughter and son-in-law were perfectly happy until you destroyed their family.""  
  
I cut straight to the point: ""Which son-in-law are we talking about here? The older one or the younger one?""  
  
She looked confused: ""What older and younger?""  
  
I had a lightbulb moment: ""Oh! You don't know? Let me tell you then.""  
  
""Your daughter Gina Reed is married to Oliver Harrison – that's your older son-in-law.""  
  
""But she's also screwing Milo Harrison – that's your younger son-in-law.""  
  
""So I'm genuinely curious – which son-in-law are you referring to?""  
  
All my colleagues gasped.  
  
Gina's mom's expression shifted: ""That's... that's complete bullshit!""  
  
I pulled out my phone.  
  
""Want to see the video? I recorded your daughter getting pounding by the younger son-in-law.""  
  
She panicked: ""You... don't you dare!""  
  
I continued: ""If you really cared about your daughter, you'd go home and tell her to stop stirring up shit.""  
  
""The divorce papers are already filed. What's the point of coming here to make a scene?""  
  
She got frantic: ""My daughter can't get divorced!""  
  
I laughed: ""What is it – can't bear to give up the older son-in-law's money, or think the younger one's not good enough?""  
  
Gina's mom was so mad she stomped her feet, but she knew she wouldn't get anywhere here and stormed off.  
  
My colleagues all looked at me with admiration.  
  
Kevin came over: ""Rita, that was fucking awesome!""  
  
I smiled: ""Awesome? That's just the warm-up act.""  
  
Back in my office, I texted Oliver:  
  
\[Your former mother-in-law just caused a scene at my company.\]  
  
Oliver replied quickly: \[Need me to handle it?\]  
  
Me: \[Nah, I took care of it.\[  
  
Oliver: \[Thanks.\]  
  
Looking at my phone screen, I couldn't help thinking life was full of surprises.

now for my tips!
I used NCLEX Bootcamp (my holy grail), Archer, and Mark K. 

Listened to all of Mark K, but relistened to the ones i knew i needed help on, like OB and Psych.

Bootcamp was my lifesaver especially since the rationales for each question were so in depth, the AI tool is heavenly. I used the AI tool to explain the thought process for each question I didn't understand. 

Archer.. I honestly didn't watch any of the videos, and HATED their rationales. I would copy and paste the questions into ChatGPT and tell it the answer I selected versus the correct answer and had it explain it to me like I was 5 years old.. LOL, it worked for me! 

And finally, note taking. I personally benefit from hand written notes, and every readiness assessment I did I would take notes on each question and I would really try to understand ""why did i choose this answer versus the others"" and basically ""how can i choose the right answer in the future"". I also refreshed on certain topics like arthritis, meds (this was a huge trouble for me), insulin, etc. 

Lastly, I took the day before my exam date to just relax. I'm big on meditating and really took the day to zone in and trust in myself.

EXAM DAY! I was a complete wreck. My exam was at 12:45pm, I had Chickfila, and my coffee (if you have coffee everyday and it doesn't give you jitters, just drink the coffee) And I had someone drive me to my testing sight so I could just focus on me myself and I. When I sat down for the exam, I closed my eyes and repeated to myself, ""I trust I am a safe competent nurse."" I also went in expecting 150 questions. Luckily I shut off at 85, but you must trick your mind to expect all questions or you'll keep wrecking yourself. 

GOOD LUCK FUTURE NURSES! I can't wait to work besides you :) 🤍🤍

Zero API costs, full privacy, works offline. It's stupidly simple to set up and genuinely game-changing for anyone tired of AI subscription bills.**

Three months ago, I got my monthly OpenAI bill and nearly choked on my coffee. $2,247 for API calls. As a developer constantly experimenting with AI models for client projects, I was burning through tokens like a kid in a candy store. That bill was my wake-up call to find a better way.

Enter **Ollama** \- a tool I'd heard whispers about but never seriously considered. The premise seemed too good to be true: run powerful language models locally, completely free, with no internet required. After diving deep into **Ollama** for three months, I'm convinced this is the future of AI development.

# The ""Holy Shit"" Moment with Ollama

Installing **Ollama** took exactly 47 seconds. Download, install, type `ollama run llama3` in terminal, and boom - I'm chatting with a model that rivals GPT-3.5, running entirely on my MacBook Pro. No API keys, no rate limits, no monthly bills.

The moment I realized **Ollama** was working offline (airplane mode test), my jaw hit the floor. Here I was, having full conversations with an AI model at 30,000 feet, while my colleagues were complaining about conference WiFi being too slow for ChatGPT.

# Living the Ollama Life: Three Months Later

# Project Work Transformation

Every client project now starts with **Ollama**. Instead of burning through API credits during the brainstorming phase, I can iterate endlessly with local models. Need to generate 500 variations of product descriptions? **Ollama** doesn't blink. Need to experiment with prompt engineering? Go wild - it's all free.

I'm currently running Llama 3.2, Mistral, and CodeLlama simultaneously on my machine. Different models for different tasks, all humming along without costing me a penny.

# Privacy Game-Changer

Working with client data used to stress me out. Sending sensitive information to OpenAI always felt risky, even with their privacy claims. With **Ollama**, everything stays on my machine. Client NDAs? No problem. Confidential documents? Process them locally without breaking a sweat.

# Development Speed Boost

**Ollama** responds instantly because it's running locally. No network latency, no server queues, no ""high demand"" slowdowns. When I'm in flow state coding, **Ollama** keeps up with my pace instead of forcing me to wait for API responses.

# The Reality Check: Ollama Limitations

Let's be honest - **Ollama** isn't perfect, and it won't replace every use case.

# Hardware Requirements Bite

Running larger models on **Ollama** demands serious RAM. Llama 70B wants 64GB+ to run smoothly. My 16GB MacBook handles smaller models fine, but I had to invest in a beefier workstation for the big guns. Factor hardware costs into your ""free"" calculation.

# Model Quality Varies

While Llama 3.2 and Mistral perform amazingly well, they're not quite GPT-4 level for complex reasoning tasks. **Ollama** excels at 80% of my use cases, but I still reach for GPT-4 for the trickiest problems.

# Setup Learning Curve

**Ollama** uses command-line interface by default. Non-technical users might struggle initially, though community tools like Open WebUI make it more accessible. It's not as plug-and-play as opening ChatGPT in a browser.

# Real-World Ollama Use Cases

**Code Review Assistant**: I feed entire codebases to **Ollama** for review suggestions. No worried about proprietary code leaving my machine.

**Content Generation**: Blog posts, social media content, product descriptions - **Ollama** handles it all. I've generated thousands of pieces without spending a dime.

**Research Assistant**: Upload PDFs, ask questions, get summaries. **Ollama** with document processing tools creates a powerful research workflow.

**Client Prototyping**: Quickly demo AI features for clients using **Ollama** as the backend. They see working prototypes without me burning through API credits.

# Ollama vs The Alternatives

**vs. OpenAI API**: **Ollama** wins on cost and privacy but loses on cutting-edge model quality. For most tasks, the quality difference isn't worth the cost difference.

**vs. LM Studio**: Both excellent for local models. **Ollama** has better CLI tools and automation capabilities; LM Studio offers a prettier GUI.

**vs. GPT4All**: **Ollama** has a larger model library and more active development. GPT4All is more beginner-friendly but less flexible.

# The Economics are Insane

My **Ollama** setup cost breakdown:

* Software: $0 (open source)
* Additional RAM upgrade: $800 (one-time)
* Electricity for running models: \~$15/month

Compare that to my previous $2,000+ monthly OpenAI bills. **Ollama** pays for itself in two weeks of heavy usage.

For freelancers and agencies, this math is a no-brainer. Client projects become more profitable when your AI assistant doesn't eat into margins with usage fees.

# Community and Ecosystem

The **Ollama** community is incredibly active. New models get added regularly, and the integration ecosystem is exploding. I've found **Ollama** plugins for VS Code, Slack bots, Discord integrations, and custom web UIs.

The model library keeps growing - from specialized coding models to multilingual conversational AI. **Ollama** has democratized access to AI in a way that felt impossible just two years ago.

# Should You Switch to Ollama?

If you're spending serious money on AI APIs and have decent hardware, **Ollama** is a must-try. The learning curve is minimal, the cost savings are massive, and the privacy benefits are real.

**Perfect for**: Developers, content creators, agencies, privacy-conscious users, anyone with high AI usage.

**Skip if**: You only use AI occasionally, prefer GUI interfaces exclusively, or need absolute cutting-edge model performance for critical tasks.

**Rating: 9/10**

* **+2 points** for eliminating monthly AI costs
* **+2 points** for complete privacy and data control
* **+2 points** for offline functionality
* **+2 points** for excellent model variety and performance
* **+1 point** for active community and ecosystem

# The Bottom Line

**Ollama** has fundamentally changed how I think about AI tools. Instead of rationing API calls and worrying about costs, I can experiment freely and build more ambitious projects. The combination of cost savings, privacy, and performance makes **Ollama** essential for any serious AI user.

Three months in, I'm using **Ollama** for 90% of my AI tasks and only reaching for cloud models when I absolutely need the latest and greatest capabilities. My monthly AI costs went from $2,000+ to basically zero.

If you're tired of AI subscription bills controlling your creativity, give **Ollama** a shot. Your wallet (and your privacy) will thank you.

**What's your experience with local AI models? Anyone else make the switch from cloud to local? Drop your thoughts below!**

I caught my husband cheating – right in my best friend's bed.  
  
There was my husband Milo Harrison, who couldn’t get it up for three years, desperately pounding my best friend Gina Reed.  
  
I whipped out my phone and snapped their fucking from every conceivable angle.  
  
Then I packaged the whole collection and sent to Gina's husband.  
  
Along with a sweet message: \[Congratulations, Oliver! Your wife's a genius healer! She juet cure my husband's impotence!\]  
  
""Well, honey, how's your impotence sure cleared up this fast?""  
  
I leaned against the doorframe with a sickeningly sweet tone.  
  
The two naked bodies on the bed instantly froze.  
  
My husband Milo looked at me like he'd seen a ghost, stammering without getting a single word out.  
  
My dear friend Gina was quicker on the uptake – she grabbed the sheets and wrapped them around herself.  
  
""Rita... we can...""  
  
""Don't rush to explain."" I pulled out my phone.  
  
""Let me get a picture first. This is the first time in three years of marriage I've seen my husband's dick this... perky.""  
  
Milo threw off the covers and lunged for my phone. I nearly got blinded by his swinging penis.  
  
""Whoa there, honey, easy does it. Why so worked up? It's not like I haven't seen it before.""  
  
I stepped back.  
  
""Oh wait, actually I haven't seen it like THIS – since you've been keeping your V-card for my bestie this three years. How thoughtful of you.""  
  
Gina's cheeks flushed red: ""Rita, let me explain. This isn't what you think.""  
  
I smiled at her: ""Explain what? You sacrificed yourself to cure my husband's ED. I should be kissing your feet in gratitude?""  
  
""You two go on. I'll just call Oliver Harrison and have him come watch his wife's sexy performance.""  
  
Gina's face went ghost white.  
  
She was Milo's brother‘s wife, my sister-in-law, and my best friend.  
  
Ah, What a fucking mess of relationships.  
  
""You wouldn't dare!"" Milo roared.  
  
I raised an eyebrow: ""You did it. Why the hell wouldn't I?""  
  
Gina suddenly threw herself at my legs.  
  
""Rita, please, don't tell Oliver. I know I screwed up.""  
  
Looking at my childhood friend, now half-naked and clinging to my legs, I suddenly found it ridiculious.  
  
""Gina, get up first.""  
  
I bent down and patted her shoulder: ""The floor's cold.""  
  
She looked up at me hopefully.  
  
I continued: ""With that pitiful face, you’re gonna break my husband’s heart.""  
  
Then I turned to leave, and Milo grabbed my arm.  
  
""What are you trying to do? You want to destroy our family?""  
  
I clenched my fists, smiling sweetly.  
  
What a shameless thing to say.  
  
""I need to go to the hospital for some tests to figure out why my husband is impotent with me but fucks everyone else so hard.""  
  
Milo's face turned bright red: ""Rita Collins, cut the sarcasm!""  
  
""Ohoh, calm down."" I held up my phone.  
  
""Want to see the photos I just took? Great composition, angles, lighting – they'd probably go viral on tiktok.""  
  
Gina lunged for my phone, but I dodged.  
  
I grinned: ""Oh, should I add a caption? How about 'My Husband and Best Friend's Sweet Moments'?""  
  
""You—!"" Gina was shaking with rage.  
  
Just then, my phone rang. Oliver's call.  
  
I hit speakerphone: ""Hey, Oliver.""  
  
""I'm downstairs. What's the apartment number?""  
  
Oliver's deep voice filled the room.  
  
Gina's pupils contracted, her whole body visibly trembling.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Footsteps echoed from the hallway.  
  
I leisurely leaned on my chair and pulled out my phone, hitting record.  
  
Oliver pushed through the door, his face stone-cold as he scanned the room.  
  
His gaze swept over half-naked Gina, then locked onto his panicked brother's face.  
  
""Bro...""  
  
Milo's voice was shaking like crazy.  
  
Oliver said nothing, just turned to me: ""You recording this?""  
  
I blinked, then quickly nodded like a good student: ""Yep.""  
  
Gina collapsed to the floor, tears streaming down her face.  
  
""Honey, this isn't what you think...""  
  
""Shut up.""  
  
Two simple words, but Gina clammed up like someone had grabbed her by the throat.  
  
I sat there watching this unfold, feeling weirdly detached from it all.  
  
I'm the one who got betrayed. I should be the most devastated person here.  
  
But instead, I sat there like a spectator, coldly watching this whole shitshow unfold.  
  
""Both of you, get dressed. Now."" Oliver's voice was ice-cold.  
  
Watching them scramble into their clothes, I almost wanted to laugh.  
  
This whole scene felt like a trashy TV drama.  
  
Once they were decent, Oliver grabbed Milo and landed two solid punches across his face.  
  
Then came a brutal knee to the gut. I watched Milo double over, clutching himself, his lips going white.  
  
After years of faking impotence, looks like he might actually achieve it now.  
  
My brother-in-law always seemed so refined and gentle. Who knew he could get this savage when pissed.  
  
After Milo hit the floor, Oliver finally spoke: ""Spill it. How long?""  
  
No one answered.  
  
""I asked you how fucking long!"" Oliver roared.  
  
Even I jumped.  
  
Gina sobbed: ""Three... three years...""  
  
Three years.  
  
Exactly how long Milo and I had been married.  
  
So he'd been lying to me from day one.  
  
All those excuses, all that bullshit about his ""condition"" – pure lies.  
  
I spoke up, my voice dripping with sarcasm:  
  
""So you two are true love? Started before Milo and I even got married?""  
  
Milo kept his head down.  
  
""Look up! Look at us when we're talking to you!"" Oliver bellowed again.  
  
Milo slowly raised his head, eyes full of terror: ""Oliver... I...""  
  
""Don't call my name!"" Oliver's voice was pure rage.  
  
""You're not my brother, you're a fucking bastard.""  
  
Milo went pale as a ghost.  
  
Gina suddenly dropped to her knees: ""Honey, I'm sorry... I really know I screwed up...""  
  
I added: ""You know you screwed up, or you're just scared now?""  
  
If I hadn't caught them, who knows how long they would've kept us wearing these green hats.  
  
I stood up and faced Oliver: ""Got everything on video. Let's go – this place is disgusting.""  
  
Oliver nodded and turned to leave.  
  
""Wait! Don't go!"" Milo panicked and dropped to his knees.  
  
I turned back with the sweetest smile:  
  
""Stay for what? Watch you and your sister-in-law go for round two?""  
  
""Besides, you want to be with your brother's wife so badly – we're doing you a favor.""  
  
""No! Honey, we can't get divorced!"" Gina shrieked.  
  
Oliver was more successful than my husband, never let her want for money. Now she probably couldn't bear to give that up.  
  
Guess compared to Milo's love, she cared more about Oliver's bank account.  
  
""You're always working, I got so lonely and made this stupid mistake. Please forgive me just this once, I swear I'll never see him again, please?""  
  
Gina looked absolutely heartbroken, even I felt a little sorry for this ‘poor beauty’.  
  
But Oliver didn't even glance her way.  
  
""No way.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
""You bitch! Get your ass out here!""  
  
Bright and early in the morning, there was screaming and wailing coming from the company lobby.  
  
I was in my office drinking coffee when a colleague told me Gina's mom had come looking for trouble. I nearly spit out my coffee.  
  
This plot development is so melodramatic.  
  
""Rita Collins, you shameless homewrecker! Seducing my son-in-law and destroying my daughter's marriage – do you have any fucking shame left!""  
  
Gina's mother had serious lung power, standing at the reception desk acting on a whole dramatic show.  
  
My colleague Kevin rushed over: ""Rita, Gina Reed's mom is downstairs causing a scene, saying you seduced her son-in-law...""  
  
I leisurely set down my coffee cup: ""Oh, well then I better go see this.""  
  
When I got to the lobby, Gina's mom was wiping away tears while trashing me to anyone who'd listen.  
  
""Everyone listen up! This woman was so jealous that my daughter married into a rich family, so she had to stick her nose in and wreck my daughter's perfect family!""  
  
I leaned against the reception counter, grinning as I watched this comedy show.  
  
The receptionist looked relieved when she saw me: ""Mrs. Reed, Manager Collins is here.""  
  
Gina's mom whipped around, getting even more pissed when she saw how relaxed I looked: ""Well look who finally dares to show her face!""  
  
""Why wouldn't I?"" I raised an eyebrow.  
  
""Should I hide like some people do after they get caught doing nasty shit?""  
  
Gina's mom's face turned bright red.  
  
""Stop twisting the facts! My daughter and son-in-law were perfectly happy until you destroyed their family.""  
  
I cut straight to the point: ""Which son-in-law are we talking about here? The older one or the younger one?""  
  
She looked confused: ""What older and younger?""  
  
I had a lightbulb moment: ""Oh! You don't know? Let me tell you then.""  
  
""Your daughter Gina Reed is married to Oliver Harrison – that's your older son-in-law.""  
  
""But she's also screwing Milo Harrison – that's your younger son-in-law.""  
  
""So I'm genuinely curious – which son-in-law are you referring to?""  
  
All my colleagues gasped.  
  
Gina's mom's expression shifted: ""That's... that's complete bullshit!""  
  
I pulled out my phone.  
  
""Want to see the video? I recorded your daughter getting pounding by the younger son-in-law.""  
  
She panicked: ""You... don't you dare!""  
  
I continued: ""If you really cared about your daughter, you'd go home and tell her to stop stirring up shit.""  
  
""The divorce papers are already filed. What's the point of coming here to make a scene?""  
  
She got frantic: ""My daughter can't get divorced!""  
  
I laughed: ""What is it – can't bear to give up the older son-in-law's money, or think the younger one's not good enough?""  
  
Gina's mom was so mad she stomped her feet, but she knew she wouldn't get anywhere here and stormed off.  
  
My colleagues all looked at me with admiration.  
  
Kevin came over: ""Rita, that was fucking awesome!""  
  
I smiled: ""Awesome? That's just the warm-up act.""  
  
Back in my office, I texted Oliver:  
  
\[Your former mother-in-law just caused a scene at my company.\]  
  
Oliver replied quickly: \[Need me to handle it?\]  
  
Me: \[Nah, I took care of it.\[  
  
Oliver: \[Thanks.\]

We romanticize the coffee-fueled, cross-country business trips, but imagine the sheer logistical challenges. No instant directions meant relying heavily on paper maps, meticulously planned routes, and trusting landmarks.Maintaining contact wasn't a simple email; it involved finding a payphone, sometimes waiting in line, and hoping someone was at the other end of the line ready to take a message. Hotels were more than just a place to sleep; thay were frequently enough temporary offices, offering fax services and meeting rooms that were crucial for closing deals on the go.

The tools they carried were radically different, too. A bulky briefcase might contain a pager, a physical day planner, a stack of presentation materials, and maybe even a portable typewriter. Presentations were slides displayed on overhead projectors, and backing up data meant carrying floppy disks. It really puts modern convenience in perspective, and makes you appreciate how easily we can now connect and collaborate from anywhere.

I was diagnosed with fatty liver in 2023 but didn’t pay much attention to it.  I also have genetic hemachromatosis confirmed by blood, so I did stop eating red meat and had a phlebotomy here and there.  

I’ve been on a terrible health journey the past 7 months with breathing issues (confirmed not to be asthma and copd), I was unable to sleep at all the first two months of this year as I’d choke while lying down.  I have mild sleep apnea and started using cpap in February.  But between December and February I was so distraught from what was happening, I lost about 45 lbs via depression and anxiety and just stopped eating.  Well it sent my gallbladder into a spiral.  And then it had to come out.  I got a wedge biopsy done at the same time which showed Steatosis 2-3, Fibrosis 2-3, inflammation 1- NAS score 2-3, borderline NASH.  Well fuck. 

I decided to get more aggressive with my weightloss after I cried for 3 days about those results. 2 weeks post gallbladder removal I started zepbound.  Since December, I’ve lost a total of 103 lbs and yesterday went to the Mayo Clinic for a follow up on my breathing issues and saw a hepatologist who decided it was time to check back in on my liver with an MRI liver with contrast plus paddle board test.  Results came back this morning, and I was shocked!  No abnormal steatosis, no fibrosis.  Gone.  I’ve been lurking here for months, hoping one day I would be able to post a success as I’ve felt so defeated in so many other areas of life.  My endoscopy showed massive signs of GERD which may be contributing to my breathing issues/shortness of breath but that’s another story.  

I don’t know if this will be helpful to anyone, but I’ll post what I’ve done here because I learned a lot from people who posted what they did.  I may have done things a little differently.  I’m a busy busy lawyer with not a lot of time to prep food and what not, so please don’t come for me- I just tried to do my best.  

1) focused on assembly meals versus prep meals.  This meant a lot of pre-cooked chicken or meats plainly seasoned from mostly Trader Joe’s or Sprouts for me;
2) cut wayyyyyyyy back on carbs, including fruit.  The only carbs I’d eat would typically be a piece of lavash bread with chicken and salad rolled up in it maybe 2-3 times a week; 
3) started looking for more vegan options (cue Trader Joe’s again, such as the vegan tzatziki sauce);
4) drank coffee every morning with half a premixed protein shake as the creamer (don’t come after me for this one, I just needed a quick way to get protein and caffeine and this was it for me);
5) 30-45 mins of walking each week day.  1 hour of walking each weekend day. 2-3 Pilates classes per week;
6) zepbound.  Right now I’m on 10 mg/week;
7) no red meat- I have hemachromatosis so that’s been my rule for a while;
8) I used to be an Advil addict.  I don’t take pain meds anymore.;
9) I had to calm the fuck down.  The stress of hearing I was at borderline NASH almost killed me (on top of my breathing issues).  I had to BELIEVE that if I improved my diet and lifestyle, there was no way I could ever be worse;
10) let myself cry and feel how I needed to feel;
11) took omega fatty acid as a supplement;
12) forgave myself for taking shitty care of my body and focused on how to fix it.  

I wish I was breathing better, but otherwise, knowing I’ve fixed my liver and lost 103 lbs is an amazing feeling in contrast to the incredible pain of hearing that I  had fatty liver/NASH.  Wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

1lmbb2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1lmbb2p/a_bit_of_a_success_story/,A bit of a success story,"I want to share my experience while it's fresh. I hope it inspires others who are struggling with BPD and dating.

For a bit of context, I was diagnosed with BPD when I was 26 y/o. Things got better when I turned 34 and was in remission by 35. The 30s tamed everything down. This happened with a few handful of therapy sessions and meeting a solid friend who became my anchor in my healing. And also I had the luxury of a freelancing job where I could slow down or totally unplug when things are too much.

Anyhooo...I'm 37 now and recently just got back to dating after being single for 6 yrs. It was scary and I probably didn't do it right. Jumped on the deepend and spent a full holiday with a man I met in Bumble. We had 1 date in Sydney, a few weeks of talking, and decided to have a holiday together. Before this, I work from home, have very little human contact, was very careful with everything to control my stress levels, to the point that I avoid coffee and alcohol because their effect on me is inconsistent. So this was a BIG and SCARY thing for me.

The date didn't turn out exactly as I want. I thought we will be sweet and intimate with each other. But that wasn't the case and there were moments I felt unwanted. It was so painful! As painful as the feeling of rejection from my previous relationship was. BUT! I'm happy to report that I was able to sit with the feelings. It was painful but it didn't destroy me. The trip was for his healing, and even though it hurt, when I remind myself of that, I was able to put my feelings aside and remind myself that this trip is not about me...it's his healing first. I had to do that a zillion times tho.

When difficult emotions arise, the things I did were...

* Deep breathing
* Shower
* Eat ice
* Acknowledge the feelings, feel them, cry and then bounce back
* Think that, ""This is a practice opportunity. An opportunity to try out the steps on how to regulate my emotions""

I have to be honest...there was one bad day that I had to down two shots of tequila to silence the feelings. Bad idea because it didn't. It still hurt and it didn't work. There was one mini suicidal thought. Ate ice and that disperse the emotional pain into other body stimulus.

So, at the moment, I'm pretty much heart broken. It's hard when someone you like doesn't like you back. But I'm a bit proud of myself that the trip wasn't ruined because of emotions I can't handle. I'm proud of putting myself out there even though my senses were constantly under attacked with stimulus from all the new things I experienced. Feeling unwanted is still hard to cope with. I still cry about it. It's not a perfect straight road to Lalaland. But I feel like I'm slowly getting there. I'm still scared to date again and worried that it will be painful again in the next date. But at least now, I know that I can be both afraid and still do it afraid. I have more confidence in my capacity to handle the emotional pain.

We had some great memories too. Karaoke nights! Island tours! Me learning to drink cocktails! I hope we both remember the good ones. ",2,1751075741.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

But I'm sure of one thing","   I'm sure this ""reality"" is being heavily manipulated. I think there's an entity/ies (let's call it that way for the lack of a more accurate word) manipulating everything in this world. And I'm tired of pretending coincidences exist at this point.

  In my case this manipulative thing is making my life really difficult since it doesn't let me enjoy anything without ruining it by making me feel bad with these ""coincidences"" that happen before, during or immediately after I'm trying to do or enjoy something, even the simplest of things like a coffee break.

  These pseudo-coincidences, as I call them, are mostly noises, among other things, like random people suddenly starting to whistle no matter where I go. What are the odds of that happening? That's one the most clear patterns that prove the manipulation I'm talking about. And it's not hallucinations coming from my head, when I'm with someone they also hear it.

  This entity even has access to my (everyone's?) thoughts, since I see very specific thoughts of mine very ""coincidentally"" reflected in posts on social network feeds, like Reddit and others. I wouldn't even care about being called crazy or paranoid. I'm not a dumb person, I have a college degree, for whatever reference it's worth, and I know how to recognize patterns when I see them. And who knows how far the manipulation rabbit hole goes.

  All in all I think the concept of manipulation is equally or even more important than the concept of simulation, since we probably wouldn't complain about being in a simulation that's not against us, or that it's even in our favor.",10,1751075677.0,SimulationTheory,8,1.0,False

I (18f) recently started working my first part-time job in a local coffee shop. It’s the type of place where everyone knows each other, so I’m basically the odd one out. 

The owner of the shop (I’ll call her J) has a granddaughter (4f, I’ll call her A), who sometimes ends up spending the afternoon with us when her parents need to go somewhere. I end up helping take care of her. She’s a sweetheart and we get along very well so I don’t mind at all. 

Everything was great until recently, when a costumer that I hadn’t yet meet appeared. He was nice, but I immediately took notice of the fact that he gave a lot of attention to A. This is not really uncommon, because like I said, everyone knows each other there and she really is a sweetheart so it’s just normal that people are going to want to interact with her, but it got to a point where he was straight up ignoring me/her grandmother to speak to A. J didn’t seem bothered by it, so I didn’t think much of it at first and chalked it up to him just being very passionate about kids. 

Some days later, he came back, and the same thing happened, but this time he decided to tickle her. I wouldn’t normally have problems with this, but I noticed he was touching A’s hips/lower back a lot, and for some reason, I just felt really uneasy. 

Then yesterday happened. When he came in, A was in the bathroom with her grandmother, he asked me where she was and I told him that she was in the bathroom. He proceeds to go and knock on the door to try and talk to her, A greets him from the inside and this man proceeds to OPEN THE DOOR to the bathroom without permission. Thankfully A was already fully dressed and washing her hands, but it genuinely threw me off. But again… no one seemed bothered but me, or at least, nobody said anything. This man is not part of their family, not does J know him that much from what I’ve seen. 

I talked with my family about this, my mother says that yes, it’s pretty weird (though she’s more paranoid than me so I don’t know how much I should consider her opinion), but my father told me that it was likely nothing and that the man was probably just tone-deaf, as he doesn’t believe anyone with bad intentions would be dumb enough to try anything like that in a public place.

I don’t plan on really doing anything (not am I sure what I could do apart from talking with J, which would probably be a pretty awkward conversation), nor do I think A is really in any danger, as from my knowledge the only interaction these two have is inside the shop, and there’s always someone around. I guess I just want some outside perspective on if I’m being too paranoid or if anyone else finds this unsettling. ",6,1751075565.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

I had planned for the 5% increase but the boss emailed me I was getting a 30% raise privately but to keep it hush hush.


Half a year into starting this position, 2 of the coworkers were going to me for advice. One time they said something about me going to the same university they went. I corrected that I went to the local community college. They’re like what? You only have a 2 year degree? How did you even get this job? You shouldn’t be making more than us that’s not right. Then they stop going to me for advice. 


Fast forward a year I find out they’ve been telling other coworkers my schooling and pay. I find out they’ve been asking the boss for raises multiple times and using me as the excuse because if I’m being paid X for my 2yr than they should be paid more for their 4 and 6 yr degrees. I’ve told them repeatedly when asking for a raise to show how they provide value to the company, training they’re taking to up their value, times they’ve shown initiative to pick up additional responsibilities, stats for their position in surrounding companies, but not to compare to others unless they’re in similar roles.


Fast forward to present day. Two weeks after getting my raise I’ve been keeping it under hush hush besides family/friends. One of the coworkers asks me to go for some coffee. We’ve done this plenty of times the last 2 weeks and would talk about our hobbies. During the coffee break I’m caught off guard and asked how much my raise was? I panicked and said 7.5%, idk why I said this. They asked how’d I get 7.5% when they only got 5%. I feel like I couldn’t say I didn’t want to discuss my raise because they would automatically assume I got a larger raise bc they asked last year.


It’s a difficult situation because one of them is 10 years my senior but makes the basically the same with their 6yr degree. The other 2 are 1-2 years older (1 6yr 1 4yr) and make ~20% less. We all have completely different roles from each other but started around the same time. We got 10% the last 3 years except last year mine was 12.5%. ",1,1751075090.0,careerguidance,4,1.0,False

My Fiancé Faked His Death, I Married His Brother
Chapter 1
On the eve of our wedding, Tristan Vale fell to his death.

Everyone assumed that, given how deeply I had loved him, I would follow him in death. But I didn’t shed a single tear.

Three years later, I met him again.

He had not only come back from the dead—he had lost his memory.

""So you’re the fiancée I supposedly had? Haven’t seen you in years, and now you look so shabby? Out of old times’ sake, I can spare one day a week for you to serve me.”

I didn’t even spare him a glance.

Tristan didn’t know that on the night he fell, I received a video.

Even more so, he had no idea that during the three years he spent faking amnesia and traveling the world with Vanessa Quinn—I got married.

And my husband is his elder brother.

Inside the private room, no one noticed I was already standing by the door.

Someone suddenly brought me up in conversation.

“Tristan, it’s been three years. What are you planning to do about Elena?”

Tristan said indifferently, “It’s been three years—what’s the rush? I’ll deal with it after I marry Vanessa.”

The room burst into chuckles.

“If you ask me, that woman Elena really is shameless. Bet she’ll be shocked stupid when she sees Tristan again!”

“Heard she’s been living in misery all these years. Figures—without Tristan, her life’s gone straight down the drain.”

Their mockery hung in the air—thick, unrestrained, and brimming with mirth.

I was just about to leave when someone spotted me and shouted, “Elena!?”

Suddenly, all eyes turned on me.

The ones who had just been laughing so gleefully now scratched their heads awkwardly, trying to smooth things over.

“Elena, we didn’t tell you Tristan was alive because he lost his memory—we didn’t want to upset you.”

I glanced at them with disgust. Before I could say anything, Tristan gave me a once-over from head to toe.

“So you’re my ex-fiancée? Why do you look so pathetic? Heard your life’s been a total mess since I was gone?”

He was still as arrogant as ever.

But I no longer had the patience I once did. Now, all I felt when I looked at him was overwhelming disgust.

Seeing me silent, Tristan didn’t get angry. He lazily wrapped an arm around Vanessa, twirling his finger on her lips.

Vanessa giggled and caught his hand, casting a provocative look in my direction.

“Elena, it’s been three years—how did you end up like this? No wonder Tristan forgot you. Looking like that, who’d even remember you?”

My fingers curled into fists before I even realized—disgust tightening every muscle. Their shameless display sickened me.

But Tristan mistook my reaction for jealousy, and looked rather smug.

“Relax, no need to be so possessive. If you still want to be with me, you’ll need to get used to this dynamic. Don’t worry—I’ll give you one day a week.”

At that, the people around me swarmed closer, jeering gleefully.

“Oh Elena, you see? Tristan still has a soft spot for you. Even with amnesia, he saved a day a week just for you!”

“As long as you serve Tristan and Vanessa well, won’t that be better than your current miserable life? Look at you—living like a beggar. Time to seize this chance!”

Vanessa lounged on the couch, her long legs lazily propped on the coffee table, body pressed tightly against Tristan.

She clicked her tongue.

“Sorry, Elena, but you’ll have to put up with it for now. What can I say? Tristan loves me the most.”

Tristan let out a scoffing laugh. Admiring Vanessa’s freshly done nails, he gave me a casual glance.

“What’s there to complain about? She loves me so desperately. Spending even one day a week with me is a gift. She should be grateful.”

His words pierced something deep inside me.

The Tristan standing here was a stranger I didn’t recognize.

Years ago, he had loved me so much.

When I was burning up with a 40°C fever for days, he dropped everything to stay by my side day and night.

He even went to Mount Aurelian, climbing all those steps, kneeling with each one, to pray for a Protection Talisman for me.

I remember his swollen, bleeding forehead and his knees, raw and torn. I was heartbroken, calling him a fool.

But he just gently cupped my face in his hands.

“As long as you’re safe and healthy, even if it costs me my life—it’s worth it.”

Those memories are vivid as ever.

But reality has changed beyond recognition. And so have I.

Chapter 2
Turns out, a person can really change that much.

Suppressing the turmoil inside me, I met Tristan’s gaze and raised my hand to show the wedding ring. I kept my tone as calm as possible.

“You’re mistaken. I’m not who you think I am.”

“And for the record, I’m already married.”

Silence fell instantly. Everyone exchanged glances, trying to read each other’s expressions—then the room erupted into laughter.

Tristan raised an eyebrow indifferently and gave my ring a cursory glance.

“Married? To who, your food delivery guy?”

“Judging by how you look, I bet the ring’s from a dollar store. What, you think that’ll jog my memory?”

With that, he suddenly stood up and yanked the ring off my finger.

I was already worn out from recent project work and didn’t react in time.

Vanessa stepped up to examine the ring closely, then suddenly burst out laughing.

“Tristan, doesn’t this look exactly like that pair of Heart of Eternity wedding rings your brother bid for in Valoria three years ago?”

“Wait a minute—Elena, are you saying your husband is… your brother Sebastian?”

Vanessa twirled the ring, casting me a smirking glance as the room erupted further.

To them, it was simply absurd.

After all, Sebastian Vale was the current heir to the Vale family—a ruthless, decisive man feared by everyone in the business world, cold as ice.

And yet, three years ago, this very man had suddenly married in secret. He loved his mysterious wife with a devotion bordering on obsession.

For the past three years, thanks to the Vale family’s airtight security and control over the press, no media outlet had been able to uncover a single detail about his wife or child .

“Elena, are you seriously claiming to be that mysterious woman no one’s been able to uncover in three years?”

Vanessa tossed the ring into the air and caught it again. Under the lights, it sparkled brilliantly.

“Oh wow, gotta admit, this fake ring’s craftsmanship is impressive. Which factory did you get to make the knockoff?”

Their jabs came one after another, and I was quickly losing patience.

“Don’t touch my ring. It’s real—”

Before I could finish, Tristan slapped me hard across the face, snapping my head to the side. A burning sting bloomed across my cheek.

“Elena, have you lost your damn mind? You’re spreading lies about my brother now?! Everyone knows how devoted he is to his wife—he won’t even show her face to me! And you dare pretend to be her? Who gave you the guts?!”

I licked my dry lips and slowly turned back to meet Tristan’s eyes.

Perhaps my stare was too chilling—Tristan frowned slightly.

Vanessa quickly stepped in, pointing a finger at me and yelling:

“Elena, how heartless can you be? Tristan’s already promised to spend a day a week with you, and you not only don’t appreciate it—you dare impersonate his sister-in-law? Everyone in Eastmere knows Sebastian’s wife is his bottom line. Are you trying to get him to take it out on Tristan? How vicious are you?”

Her words made something click in my mind.

Vanessa had always seen me as a threat. She constantly schemed to undermine me—spreading rumors, sabotaging presentations, even flirting with Tristan.

She’d even tried to sabotage my relationship with Tristan by slandering me every day in front of him.

But back then, Tristan never believed her. He’d even punished her harshly for it.

And now, the man who once stood by me… was siding with her.

He grabbed Vanessa’s hand and flung a wad of cash in my face.

“Alright, enough pretending. Out of old feelings, I won’t press charges. Considering how desperate you seem, this should last you a while.”

The sharp corners of the bills nicked my skin, drawing beads of blood. I didn’t react. I simply looked up and locked eyes with Tristan.

For a brief moment, something like guilt and panic flickered across his face.

I crouched to retrieve the ring, a frosty smile tugging at my lips.

Tristan’s panic faded, replaced by sneering disdain.

“Pfft, thought you had some pride…”

But before he could finish, his words stuck in his throat.

Under his stunned gaze, I picked the ring out from the pile of red banknotes.

Tristan’s body went rigid, breath caught halfway. Before I could leave, he stepped in front of me.

“You’re still pretending? One of these bills is worth more than dozens of your cheap rings!”

His face contorted—on closer look, rage simmered beneath the surface.

I ignored his reaction and slapped his hand away.

His arm stiffened midair, and he bit down so hard his teeth clicked.

“Well, looks like you’ve grown some nerve,” he snarled. “Still clinging to your pride, even in poverty, huh? Fine. In three days, it’s my wedding with Vanessa. My brother will be flying back then, and he’s bringing his mysterious wife to the ceremony. If you’ve got the guts—come.”

Chapter 3
At the mention of “wedding,” Vanessa’s eyes lit up as she added sarcastically,

“Maybe she’s too scared of getting caught and won’t even dare show up.”

I had no intention of getting dragged into their games any further. I turned and walked away with long strides, leaving one final remark behind.

“I’ll be there in three days. I hope you’ll all still be this confident then.”

As soon as I stepped out of the club and breathed in the fresh air, the nausea that had churned in my gut slowly subsided.

I pulled out my phone and replayed the video I had received three years ago.

In the footage, the man held Vanessa in an intimate embrace, a smug, half-lidded grin on his face.

“Elena is such a bore. Sure, I love her, but she doesn’t give me the thrill I want.”

“This little game of faking my own death—once I’ve had enough fun, I’ll go back. She’s the type to settle down with. With her personality, she might even go all out and die for me. You guys better keep an eye on her.”

The day I received the death certificate, I truly considered ending it all.

It was his friends who stopped me again and again, not letting me do anything foolish.

Now I see it—their sobs were an act, trembling on the edge of laughter.

I put away the phone and looked up at the dim streetlight.

Whether Tristan lived or died—it no longer mattered. In my heart, he ceased to exist three years ago.

Three days later, I arrived at the wedding venue as promised.

The moment Tristan saw me enter, the tension in his expression abruptly melted away.

I averted my gaze, moving toward a seat with measured calm. But just as I was about to sit, someone deliberately tripped me, and I went sprawling into the towering wedding cake, nine tiers tall.

Sugar roses, fondant figurines, and whipped cream came crashing down. My designer gown was immediately drenched in frosting. I looked utterly disheveled.

A glass goblet shattered beside me, and the shards sprayed upward, slicing across my face.

The room exploded into chaos. All eyes were glued to me.

Cream blurred my vision. As I struggled to get up, someone shoved me hard again, and I fell once more.

Vanessa’s furious voice rang above me.

“Elena, what the hell are you trying to do?! We were kind enough to invite you to our wedding. You didn’t even bring a gift—and now you pull this stunt? Jealous much? Just couldn’t stand seeing us happy, huh?!”

There were a lot of people at this wedding—many of them came hoping to catch a glimpse of Sebastian and his mysterious wife. Now, they were all scrambling to curry favor with his younger brother.

“Seriously, the nerve of some people. Causing a scene at the wedding of Sebastian Vale’s brother—let’s see how she talks her way out of this.”

“Hey, look at the ring on that woman’s hand! Doesn’t it look just like the Heart of Eternity ring Sebastian spent a fortune on three years ago?”

“Everyone knows how deeply Sebastian loves his wife. And she dares to show up pretending to be her? She’s got a death wish.”

Tristan heard the comments too. His chest heaved with rage, his eyes blazing like wildfire.

“Elena, you’re a curse! I must’ve been blind to ever fall for you. Wearing that fake ring—what, you think my brother’s going to deal with you personally?”

With that, he stormed toward me and stomped on my left ring finger, grinding his heel mercilessly.

Pain shot through me like lightning, sharp and unbearable. My heart felt like it was being stabbed by a thousand knives.

I tried to resist, but Vanessa ever the manipulator, shouted for the guests—her family’s cronies—to pin me down. In seconds, I was pinned in place.

Cream still clung to my vision, and I could barely move.

Furious, I shouted through clenched teeth:

“Sebastian is my husband!”

Tristan burst into laughter, as if I had just told the world’s funniest joke. His foot twisted cruelly, and the tip of his leather shoe threatened to crush my finger entirely.

“Still trying to fake it? Just wait till my brother gets here. He’s obsessed with my sister-in-law—you’ll be dead the moment he sees you!”

I saw no hope in him. My heart sank.

I struggled with everything I had, but the others held me down tightly.

Mark my words. Every last one of them will regret this day.

Tristan ground down again, and a sickening crack tore through the air—I felt it before I heard it.

Then—suddenly—the pressure lifted.

Everyone around me sprang up, hastily fixing their clothes and turning their attention toward the entrance.

The banquet hall doors were being pulled open by the waitstaff.

And in walked Sebastian, with our son in his arms, commanding the room like royalty.

Chapter 4
Sebastian strode confidently into the room, holding a small child in his arms.

The boy looked very young, but his speech was surprisingly clear as he called out for his mother.

“Daddy, where’s Mommy? You said she’d be here. Where is she?”

With that, he squirmed to get out of Sebastian’s arms.

The little one landed softly on the floor, instantly drawing the gaze of the entire room. Bodyguards followed him closely, tense and alert in case he fell.

Vanessa stepped forward just then, holding a small plate of cake.

“Auntie just loves sweet little boys! Come here—how about some yummy cake?”

She smiled warmly, but the child frowned and swatted the plate out of her hands.

“Go away! You’re smiling like the bad guys in cartoons. My mommy said I shouldn’t take food from strangers. And you definitely look like a bad person. Stay away from me—I want my mommy!”

“You’re the bride, right? My mommy said she’d come. Have you seen someone pretty and kind?”

Vanessa’s hand froze mid-air. Humiliated by a child in front of everyone, her expression turned pale with fury, but she didn’t dare lash out in front of Sebastian.

“Your mommy isn’t here. Everyone who’s attending is already here—do you see her among them?”

As soon as she said that, the room erupted in hushed whispers.

“What?! Sebastian’s wife is here today? She’s been hidden for three years—is she finally coming out of the shadows?”

“Who is she, exactly? I’ve looked around this entire room and honestly, not a single one of these women seems good enough for Sebastian!”

“Elena just had the audacity to pretend to be her—imagine, Sebastian’s wife might’ve been here the whole time, watching her humiliate herself. What a disgrace!”

Even now, I couldn’t believe there were still people convinced I was an impostor pretending to be Sebastian’s wife.

Tristan stepped forward, beaming as if reuniting with family.

“Sebastian, you’re finally here! It’s been years—I’ve missed you! By the way, where’s your wife?”

Sebastian cast him a distant, indifferent glance and replied in a flat tone.

“I had some unresolved business overseas and came later than expected. She came back three days ago. Said she’d contact you herself. Didn’t she?”

Tristan was caught off guard, a flicker of surprise crossing his face.

“No… No one’s contacted me in the past three days. I haven’t seen her at all.”

The boy, still unable to find me, began to cry.

“Waaaah! I want Mommy! I haven’t seen her in three days! Where did you all take her?!”

Vanessa stepped forward again, wearing a gentle smile.

“Sweetheart, your mommy is probably stuck in traffic. She’ll be here soon. But you know what? There’s a bad woman here who’s been pretending to be your mommy—do you want to see her?”

A flicker of doubt crossed the boy’s little face. Vanessa smiled even wider.

“She pretended to be your mommy and even made a fake ring to fool people! She caused a huge scene and ruined our big day—all with a fake ring made of cheap junk. But don’t worry, Auntie already punished her for you. I made sure your mommy got justice!”

Guests who were eager to flatter Sebastian now chimed in one after another.

“That’s right, Mr. Vale. You wouldn’t believe how outrageous that woman was—she claimed to be your wife even knowing you were about to arrive. And she flashed that cheap fake ring around, thinking none of us would notice!”

Tristan stepped forward too.

“Don’t worry, Sebastian—I handled her. Taught her a lesson and tossed that fake ring. No one’s going to impersonate my sister-in-law again. You can rest easy now!”",1,1751075067.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,3,1.0,False

ABOVE THE SUN

As she wanders in the woods, she sees a brilliant light beaming down from a small, decaying tree, the tree not higher than 2 feet, calling to her as if it were drawing her in. ""Come, darling, come closer."" She slowly approaches, scared that if she gets too close, it will engulf her. The beam of light is now so bright it's just a white sheet in front of her. She takes a deep, inviting breath as she disappears into a bluish-grayish environment new to her. He is on the other side, a tall, bulky man staring her down like she is his new prey. ""Who are you?"" she softly whispers, still walking towards him. ""I am your angel."" She sits in front of her now, stunned by his beauty and deep green eyes like most of the purest kind. ""Why do I get an angel?"" she thought. ""I am sick and dangerous. I destroy everything I touch. Everyone around me becomes bruised and aching. How do I know he is who he says he is? Maybe he is a mimic or a beautiful hallucination."" She shuddered at the thought and then stood as straight as she could and loudly and in a confident cadence said, ""Who are you? Tell me the truth."" As he opened his mouth to answer, she felt a wave of anxiety wash over her. ""I am..."" He cut himself off and started a new string of conversations. ""That's not important. All you need to know is I belong to you, and you belong to me."" Was that supposed to make her feel better, that she now owned someone? Well, that didn't do anything for her. Why would it? I don't want to be owned by anyone. I don't want to own anyone. I want to live a life that I am proud of. I want to find someone that I can love and cherish. He smirks a cold and dark smirk. ""Too bad you have no choice."" Only as he says these words, his voice slowly slides up what seems to be like 4 octaves, matching her voice to a tee. Suddenly, she realizes who he is exactly. ""You're me."" She blurts out, now cursing under her breath because that should have stayed a thought and only a thought. She had no idea who he was really or what he was capable of. He then starts to laugh so uncontrollably that he begins to shake. You think like a child, don't you, darling? He brushed the strands of her hair out of her face with his fingers. Think again, and this time, take your time and use your grown-up brain. She felt an urge to pout and stick her tongue out at him. How dare he speak to her like that, like he knew her, like that's the way you speak to anyone, let alone a stranger? As she thought again, she closed her eyes. Staring at him was too distracting at this point because, as scared as she was, she was also comforted by his presence. Who was he? She becomes stiff and cold to the touch. He notices quickly, not thrown off by it in the slightest. She feels his breath in her ear, now hot and angry, yet he speaks with a slow and encouraging voice: ""Hurry up, darling, we don't have all day."" This statement confuses her because he had just told her to take her time, and now he is rushing her. ""You're not me."" ""No,"" he said with a soft laugh in his voice, ""you're not an angel."" ""Wrong again, darling,"" he responded, a little less friendly. ""You are..."" ""Hurry up,"" I said. He now barked fast and venomously. Another flash of light came, but this time, she only noticed it in the shadows behind her eyelids. He is my shadow.""  ""That's exactly what I am, darling. She heard now with her eyes open. She realized his mouth didn't move at all when she heard that she heard his thoughts or, rather, their thoughts. Why are you here? Why are we here? What is this place? Questions now flooding her mind, she looks down at her and simply states, This is our home. Home?! All other questions are now obsolete. How could this be home? It's dark and lonely. There is nobody here, not a single soul besides her and him. Nothing made sense. She sucks in a deep breath, pushing away the desire to melt down to the ground and sob. He grabs her hand firmly and walks her over to a small table that suddenly appears behind them. She had let a few tears escape. He reaches his other hand to her face and wipes them away. Expecting him to wipe them on his clothes, she becomes bewildered as he places his now wet fingers in his mouth, tasting the salt on her tongue. As he does it, all becomes undeniable: he is my shadow, my actions are his and mine, and his. Do you have a name? she whispers, scared for some reason. You can call me anything you are comfortable with. He responds sweetly somehow. That was scarier to her—that he was so sweet and nice. It's a matter of time before he is a dark monster. Even when he was impatient earlier, it was almost as if he were a parent frustrated with a child because he could see the potential they had. She flicks back to minutes ago when he was telling her to hurry. The heat in his eyes was never truly venomous. It was rather an anticipation for the truth. He knew who he was, and so did she; she just had to remember. She slowly stands up, leaving him sitting. Even sitting down, crunched up, he seemed massive compared to her, his stature long and his shoulders broad. He looked like he could easily pick her up and fold her in half if he wanted to, yet his face looked so soft and gentle. He looks at her with questioning eyes. So, where are you off to? She looks into his eyes and says, I am going to explore. There's no way we're the only two here. His face suddenly drops. He is hiding something, she thought. As quickly as that thought appeared, she heard his voice: Do you dare go snooping around here? This isn't your playground. She was offended by his audacity. He told me this is my home, and now I can't even look around. Make it make sense. A small child then pokes her head around from a tree and gives out a small giggle. You're here! Finally! SHE'S HERE! She screamed as if she was an intercom, loud and booming—well, as booming as you can be for a small child of her size. Suddenly, a whole group of people came out from every corner of this forest, all different ages and genders, all bearing this sense of familiarity. Even I was sure I had never met any of them before. We knew you would make it. We knew you would come home. HOME  i repeat loudly and now staring at the man with the moss colored eyes who are these people and i swear to god if you tell me they're my shadows i am wringing your neck out with it i say sharply not wanting to wait for a convoluted lie or excuse as his lips part to give an answer the little girl speaks first we are your family this confused me even more than his answer to me before huh what do you mean your my family there they are the tears i was pushing back now a never ending faucet a taller girl who looked like she couldn't be older than fourteen then moves in front of the little girl and grabs my hand her hand is cold and her eyes are watering we are your family she repeats back to me we are all different parts of you shadows if you will she gives a small chuckle glancing at him by the the confusion has grown into full blown anger without thinking i exploded DO NOT LAUGH AT THIS this is not fucking funny She quickly apologizes as a new person speaks up from the back of the group ""isnt it though funny i mean we have been in here so long, and you finally get here demanding answers from day one without even so much as a hello."" ""This isn't my fault,"" I spit back. ""It's not ours either, not even his."" He gestures to the moss-eyed man. So let's start this over, shall we? Hello, I'm Dante. Who are you? I took a long, deep breath and calmly said my name was Clara, except after I introduced myself, the same voice spoke again in a straightforward way, ""No, it's not. Try again this time; think a little harder."" That made me angry all over again. What did he mean? No, it's not. I was fairly certain I knew my name, but I humored him, closed my eyes, and thought, Who am I? What's my name? As soon as that question left my mind's eye, I heard a loud, angry, almost violent voice scream. Alice Sofia Rossi, come here. My eyes snapped open, and suddenly, I was no longer in the forest; I was in a house, staring at my mother, who had tears welling in her eyes. I couldn't tell if they were angry tears or tears of sadness. She was at the front door of the house, door wide open, her hands now on my shoulders. She looks at me and says, ""Your dad is here. Bye."" There is a car outside, a man in the driver's seat, and no one else in the car. I say, ""Okay, Mama, I love you. Bye."" She, still looking at me, says, ""Bye,"" and just like that, I am in the car alone with my dad. My eyes close again and open to the forest again. What was that?! That was the first time you saw us. That makes zero sense, though; you weren't there. It was just my parents and me. How old were you? Give an educated guess. Ben says I had to have been no more than five years old. That was your first split. The first time, you couldn't handle what was happening in your life. After that car ride, I showed up at my grandma's house. I noticed it wasn't me speaking now.
At all, it was that little girl, now scared and trembling. ""Are you okay?"" I say quietly to her. ""I was there, not you,"" she whimpered. ""So your name is Alice too?"" I ask. She responds, almost in a trance-like state, ""My name is Cecilia. I am 5 years old.""  I start speaking to Dante again, ""If you're all parts of me, how are you all different people of all different ages and genders? We are all at the age where we can handle what is going on in life, so our brain creates people who do it for us. We don't know why we are all different genders, though, so I did it. I caused you all pain and suffering. I am a monster. I knew it. 
No, not at all. None of this is your fault; it's not our fault either. It's the fault of the people who were supposed to protect you. I started to feel sick i double over nearly dry heaving all of these people are me but not they’re stronger than me in so many ways even the little girl who can barely speak is stronger than me i couldn't handle my own life so they stepped in to take over why couldn't i handle it there are so many others in the world who endure the same and they could but not me no my brain broke isn't that what happened when it became a “normal” occurrence my brain cracked and shattered into a mess of people how many people are here i slow start counting reaching a easy twelve there could be more but even at twelve my head starts swimming all of you are my saviors you beared the burdens i could thank you i start saying as i fall to my knees tears streaming down my face stand up please you do not need to thank us for this if anything you need to get to know all of us because we hold the secrets of your life that you can't remember its not that you werent here for it all you were you were just riding passenger if you will once you start talking to us more youll remember it wont be as scary as it feels right now these words came from a older women who looked as old as my mother  she was a short brown haired girl tied in a ponytail she was smiling but it seemed forced like she wasnt happy more just trying to put me at ease her eyes were soft and inviting come with us we will protect you as we have all these years but this time you will get to drive sometimes youre stronger now and you are getting stronger daily it may be terrifying at times but you will learn to love the person you have become i look at her now slightly confused because how can i learn to love myself and not them she said oh silly girl we are you well rather parts of you you can learn to love us too if you would like but our main goal in our existence is to get you to heal and learn to love yourself you have been through so much in your life but do not go blaming everyone she was quick to say because the people you relied on did the best they could most of the time they had no idea what was going on and when they found out it was too late to fix the damage that occurred now i know some of those people hurt you separately and they were wrong for doing that and should have owned up to those actions but you cant blame them entirely even you yourself have done things in your life that were horrible you have hurt a lot of people but you are slowly trying to fix that damage and heal yourself and others around you we are so proud of you. When I heal, will you all leave me? Alice whispers enough that it could have easily been to calm herself rather than a question for the girl. Even so, the girl responds, 'No, we will be here, at least some of us.' Which confused Alice ""only some of you""? Yes, as you heal, some of us will leave then rendered unneeded. Is this all a dream am i going to suddenly wake up and be in my bed in the real world ""Fuck no this is not a dream"" Alice heard from the back of the crowd from a deep gravely voice who i knew wasnt Dante but someone far darker in intent  ""who was that"" Alice snapped back ""name's  Lucious"" he quickly retorted then they all stopped  it grew quiet and still all eyes now on Alice she suddenly felt like a fish in a very small bowl little Cecilia toddled up to her very unsteady on her feet balancing on her tiptoes she slowly reached up offering her small hand Alice looked at her hand for a brief minute her little fingers curled towards the sky naturally but as to not make Cecilia uncomfortable she darted her eyes back to the little ones and grabbed her hand Cecilia let out another small giggle and smiled widely ""come see "" she said pulling Alice towards a group of tall trees weery but curious Alice followed they loop around the bend of the trees a small house appeared no bigger than a studio apartment ""what the hell"" Alice whispered thinking has this always been here it didn't seem like it when i first showed up. Cecilia knocks on the door, and you hear a hurried click of heels running towards the door. ""Hold on, I am coming,"" a high-pitched voice calls out. Then, the door opens to a huge front entryway. A short-haired girl stands in the doorway, ushering Alice to come in with a slight smile on her face. ""Welcome home, hun,"" she says. I am         Francesca. She was elegant and poised, almost as if she hoped out of a fashion magazine. ""Nice to meet you. I am Alice."" ""Oh, no, you don't need to introduce yourself. I know exactly who you are. We have been waiting for you. "" she then locks the door and walks off into a hallway. I look around at the entryway, dumbfounded by how big this place truly is on the inside. It didn't make any sense how could a place that looked no bigger than a studio apartment be this big. I see a giant projector-style screen on the wall. Below it, a long table that accommodated four chairs lengthwise was positioned, and behind the table, two lounge couches were situated, separated by the hallway walls. Aside from the couch on the right side, there was a set of double doors, and on the left sat a small coffee bar, a coffee table, and a window looking out to the forest. Alice stands in awe at what she is looking at. Just then, a robotic-sounding voice coming from an intercom system said, 'You can look around more if you'd like.' I promise it is okay. This is your home. Now accepting this as a fact, she turned to face the double doors. She walked into a mid-sized kitchen that was too small for the double doors it had. It was your typical kitchen, nothing special. She could see someone had been in it recently. A plate of cold toast sat on the counter next to an empty coffee cup. She grabbed the cup, placed it in the sink, and left the toast sitting on the counter, unsure if someone was done with it. Then turned and walked through a small door in the kitchen, revealing a mop closet. On the other wall, there was a second door. This door led her into a hallway lined with many doors, some bearing names, others decorated. Just then, Francesca walked out of a room. Follow me she said with a gentle smile. Alice was jealous of how good her makeup looked. She could never get the hang of makeup. Alice, now following Francesca, stops in front of a white door, bare and plain. This is your room. You are free to decorate it any way you want, and if you want any help, I am always here. Francesca was short, like really short, barely surpassing Cecilia's height. Alice wondered if she, too, was a child or just short. ""How old are you, Francesca?"" ""I am 19. I know I might not seem like it with my height."" She gives a light chuckle and then asks me for my age. ""I don't understand how you know my name and that I belong here but do not know my age.""? ""because we aren't all-knowing, silly,"" Francesca playfully says. I wondered where everyone else was. It's been a while since I last saw them; they were in the middle of a forest, even though this was their house. Then I got curious. Why were you here when I arrived and not with everyone else? I asked. Certainly, someone needed to stay in the house to ensure he didn't break in, so I volunteered. I needed my makeup anyway. She said this so casually as if she knew who she was talking about. ""Who""? I said, ""Oh right, you have no idea what I am saying, Diavolo. He is a horrible, mean person."" I have not met anyone like that today. Everyone I have met has been at least cordial, not exactly nice but not horrible, and no one by that name has spoken to me. She pushes my face to face hers, and our eyes meet. ""Are you positive""? She says this in a very stern way though she was slightly panicking; I could see it. ""Yes, I am sure about that. I promise you"". ""listen to me. You need to never listen to him. No matter what he says, he is bad and will try to take over the body,"" before I even have time to respond I hear a rush of voices in the entryway suddenly she snaps to her normal bubbly self smiles and says ""sweet their home lets go hang out with everyone"" we turn to leave my room I am still left confused and scared. Still, I couldn't show them that I'd just arrived, so I put on a smile and walked out with Francesca. ""Hey everybody,"" she said. ""Hey,"" they all say in unison. ""I'm glad you're all back; I missed you guys."" You saw us three hours ago, Jesus; a girl replied, obviously annoyed by Francesca. ""Oh, fuck off. I'm just happy to hang out with everyone here. We never get to anymore"". damn, it's been three hours. It hasn't felt like more than half an hour, and why was that girl so rude to Francesca? ""So, anyone trying to smoke""? Dante says, sitting at one of the furthest at the long table. Oh yeah, Francesca says. I am the girl from before,"" she says, less annoyed this time. I grab the papers. Someone grab the bud. Lucious calls out, walking to his room. Then, another tall, almost bald man walks off, saying not a word. Cecilia starts running to her room, chanting, ""Tea party time!"" You hear a loud door slam, followed by upbeat music. That one guy returns, holding a large bud jar packed with dusty purple buds. ""I will roll,"" a girl comments. ""Thanks, Adrienne,"" Dante replies. I plop down on the floor in front of the couch. I prefer the floor. It feels safer, especially in these uncertain times. I don't know them well enough to sit so close to them. As the rotation progresses, we begin to get to know each other. Adrienne is 18 and into dark, witchy things and isn't very keen on socializing. She is a tall, slender girl with long black hair that covers one side of her face like a curtain. Lucious is a large-built guy like he belonged on a football team. He looked very unfriendly, yet Cecilia was his kryptonite.

1lmb0ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PopularEnthusiasm692/comments/1lmb0ar/snake_in_tall_grass_part_2/,Snake in Tall Grass (Part 2),"The dog days of summer. Lazy mornings bled into lazy afternoons bled into lazy nights and back again. Around the wheel in a hopeless timelapse. I had bought a bag of green apples at the Farmers’ market, and was sitting on a rock overlooking the river, slowly chewing on one. I don’t know why I bought green apples. I never really liked them. But when I was younger, mom loved them, and would always buy big bags of them in the summer. I used to jokingly call her Granny Smith, and she would laugh right along with me, every time, though I guess the joke never was that funny. 

My thoughts were interrupted by the starchy taste of paper in my mouth. I spat. Looked at the apple. There seemed to be a strand of paper inside of it. I pried pieces of the apple off, so as not to rip the paper. Once I had the entire strand out, I took a good look. The words flowed into one another in beautiful cursive. Here is what they said: “Teal suitcase. Man with spiders in his beard. Halfway tree. May your journey be blessed.” Then there was a signature, but that was the part that had been in my mouth, and it was too smudged to read. It looked like it started with an E.

I wondered what these words could mean. What was the halfway tree? Anytime my brain registered the phrase, I felt something stir inside. Not metaphorically. It felt like there was a literal movement inside of me, a kind of shifting deep within. I wondered how this message ended up in the apple, and what that strange woman had to do with it. I had seen her more frequently now, or maybe just noticed myself seeing her more. Peeking at me from behind a food truck, looking at me from the top story of a building. She was starting to show up in the background of some of my old photos. I was convinced I was having a mental breakdown, but couldn’t bring myself to do anything about it.
------------------------
I slept that night. Saw strange images that frightened me. None quite made sense. They were all just beyond my ability to explain. Maybe if I could see them again, I could put them down here, but at the same time, I don’t want to see them again. Some things are like that.

I jerked awake, sheets tangled around me like a snake coiled around a rod. My face was wet. I thought I must have been sweating or crying. In my peripheral, I saw a shadow pass in front of the window. I looked up, and it was her. My head pulsed. A light must have turned on, because I could see her perfectly well, and I know for a fact that the room was no longer dark.

“Aidan,” she said. “You’re bleeding.” I put a hand to my face and pulled it away, and I saw warm, sticky blood dripping from my fingers. I had an urge to scream, not from pain, but from fear. I must have had a sizable gash in my forehead. Yet I couldn’t feel any pain from it. I couldn’t feel anything at all. “Let me help,” she said. Before I knew it, her small hand was running over my face. Suddenly I could feel again. It felt cold and electric. I shivered. I touched my face again, and there was no bleeding, nor any cut or gash that I could feel. She had erased it as though it had never existed. 

“Th-Thank you,” I said. I didn’t look at her face. I didn’t look at her at all. Every time I saw her, there was something not quite right. I can’t quite think of what it is, now. But there was something.

“Sing with me,” she said. She held out an instrument I had never seen before. My mind couldn’t quite understand it. Have you ever seen one of those one-sided strips of paper? Mobius strips, they call them. It was kind of like that. It was real, physical, tangible, and yet something about the geometry wouldn’t quite click in my brain. But she started playing it as easily as I play the six-string, and soon, the music had me in a strange state. I felt I had sunk deep into myself. Just like when I stare at the wallpaper too long, or try too hard to reflect on my past. Peaceful, but trapped, like when you’re pinned beneath something and then have a moment of utter relaxation before the claustrophobia kicks in. 

At some point during this state, I must have moved, for now I was playing my guitar with her, playing chords I’d never heard before, progressions that sounded ancient and secret, unholy even, which I felt deep inside of me, echoing in empty caverns within my soul. She began to sing. Sing? No. It was more of an…intonation, a strange, open-mouthed humming in falsetto. She seemed to be producing multiple notes at once, and they reverberated around the room, contributing to my lull. I joined in. As if through a tunnel, I saw her playing that impossible instrument, and it seemed she had hundreds of hands sprouting from one arm, like the crown of a tree growing out of the trunk. Words started floating around me. She was singing, and I was singing along. I had to focus to make out the words, and even now, I’m not quite sure about all of them:

“If I make it to the halfway tree,
I’ll open up my soul to see
Elysian fields of ecstasy,
A blot on a white sheet.

The beaded one will cradle us,
Eternity will be our lust,
Shadows slowly gain our trust,
And we: their favorite treat.

But here is where we find true bliss,
In upward rain, in garden mist.
In halfway tree, forever.”

The music swelled louder and louder as the song drew on. The tempo increased; the passion in our voices became more potent, more venomous-–there were more voices altogether-–until the last verse, when the instruments dropped out, and it was just us two again, singing an eldritch melody about a pipe dream I longed to see fulfilled.

I opened my eyes. It was daylight. I was lying on my stomach, on my bedroom floor. She was not there, nor any sign of her, though I still could hear a faint echo of the song in my skull. I tried to hum the melody again, but I couldn’t quite think of it, and whenever I felt like I was about to place my finger on it, it slipped away, unfathomed. 

I felt like a husk. Emptier than ever before. I felt like until I reached the halfway tree, I could never feel whole again. I stalked the town just before dawn and just after sunset, walking alone, trying to think of something. But I didn’t know what I was trying to think of. I would sometimes catch myself staring at my hands, waiting for a vein to slither out, or an extra finger to grow from my palm. Anytime I thought something like this, I would find a sink and splash cold water on my face, and it would bring me back to a semblance of normalcy for a while.
_____________________________________________________________________________
When I was a child, my cousins and I used to try to catch garter snakes at my great aunt’s farm. One time, we had a giant one cornered under a car. My cousin John lunged for it, and got a grip on its tail. It wrapped itself around his arm, and he started to freak out. Irrationally, he tore it off his arm and flung it onto the ground, even though we all knew that garter snakes were harmless. John stomped that snake to death. I remember it’s crushed head on the gravel. What I remember more is the smell on his arm. Garter snakes release a foul-smelling musk as a defense mechanism. Few predators will eat a garter snake, but some might kill one nonetheless. John didn’t feel bad about killing it. In his mind, it was completely the snake's fault. It had been the one to wrap itself around him. It had been the one to leave that disgusting odor on his body. I’m not sure why, but that event burned itself into my mind, and it comes back every once in a while to haunt me.
_____________________________________________________________________________
My performance at work was slipping. I was giving people tea when they asked for coffee, or coffee when they asked for tea. I kept getting lost on strange details. I would hold the string of a tea bag and pluck it repeatedly, trying to evoke the sound of her instrument. Or maybe I was trying to bring the string to life. I can’t tell. Any time I try to examine my motives, it’s the same pulsing head, the same fuzziness I’ve grown to hate and embrace.

Soon, I stopped showing up to work altogether. At some point they must have fired me. I don’t think I ever got my last paycheck. I couldn’t think about that though. I was empty, as sure as if someone had taken a shovel and scooped out my guts. 

It was in this hollow state that I saw it. The teal suitcase. Don’t ask me what month I found it, because for the life of me, I can’t remember. It was rainier, is all I know. I was walking through shrubbery in some park. I think it was Carson Park. I didn’t remember driving there, but there was no way I could’ve walked that far. Right? My leg was barely sore.

It was sitting there as though it had been waiting for me for a long time. It looked worn, but it still held its vibrant color. It was zipped shut, and I could make out no holes in the case. I walked up and felt it. It was dry despite the rain. It was warm despite the cold. I tried to lift it from the ground, but it remained stuck.

I unzipped the suitcase, not sure what to expect inside. I opened the lid, and looked in. I saw nothing. Nothing, that is, except a deep pit falling endlessly into the ground, its end out of sight, obscured in shadow. A ladder on one cement wall. The suitcase was a trapdoor, leading somewhere. I wondered how no one else had found this. 

Any sane person would have zipped the suitcase shut, and contacted authorities about the situation. But not only was I no longer sane, I was starting to doubt altogether that I was even a person anymore. With barely a moment’s hesitation, I started the climb down the deep hole. 

Growing warmth. As I descended, everything started to seem different. The cement of the walls gradually shifted into some strange, more organic material. Once the rungs ran out, I was forced to touch it, stick my hands and feet into it. It was warm and wet and squishy. As I plunged my hands and feet in, it shifted in protest, and I felt an acidic bile come to try to fill the new abrasions. Whatever I was inside of was alive. This much was clear. I was being digested.

The steep drop slowly evened into a horizontal crawl. I worked my way through the darkness, which had taken on a red tint, like when you shine light through your hand. I was on my hands and knees, for I couldn’t stand up. The further I went, the tighter the crawl got. I considered turning back. A strange stench had started to grow, and I was now army crawling through the system. But something pulled me forward. Not a curiosity. A necessity. I had no option but to continue. It was my destiny being made manifest, for lack of better words.

After what felt like minutes or hours or days of crawling, I started to hear noises other than the pulsing of blood on the other side of the flesh I was crawling through. Skittering. Something was in here with me. It was too dark to see, but occasionally, I would reach my hand forward, and it would brush against something scratchy, something moving. My brain quickly filled in the blanks after touching a few of these moving things. Spiders. Big spiders. Tarantulas. 

I’ve always had a fear of spiders. Even in this state, the realization of what I’d been touching, what I’d been crawling with, scared me. I felt my heart booming in my chest. I wondered how many spiders were here with me. I wondered how long it would take before one would bite me, or crawl onto my face, or, God forbid, into my mouth. I thought I felt one of these legs brush up against my forehead, though I might have imagined it. My arms were stuck underneath me, and I couldn’t swat at it. If it weren’t for the squishiness of the tunnel I was squeezing through, I would’ve been pinned for eternity. 

However, as it was, there was just enough leeway for me to pull myself to the end of the tunnel, and through the exit, though it was tighter than any passage I had passed through since birth. Squeezing my way out, I was worried my hips were not going to be able to make it through, but the walls expanded just enough for me to take a great, final pull, and I escaped, breathless, and smelling of intestine.

I landed on soft ground. Grass, softer than any I had ever touched before. I laid on my back with my eyes closed for an extended moment before examining my surroundings. When I did, I almost choked with fear. Hundreds, no, thousands of tarantulas, the smallest of which were larger than my hand, all standing dead still, eyes fixed to me. Each of them had their two front legs raised toward me. I’ve never been one to read human emotion into animals before, not even family pets, but I knew at that moment that the spiders were angry. Angry at me. I slowly stood up, spinning around, afraid to take my eyes off the gigantic arachnids. As I stood, their eyes seemed to follow me. Too many eyes. All hating me. I glanced down. Underneath where I had been laying, there was no grass. There was the crushed body of the largest spider I have ever seen, huge and black and hairy and soft. Dead. Oozing. 

That was when they started coming toward me. Helplessly, I watched as countless of these abominable arachnids crawled toward me on long, hairy legs. Before I knew it, they were on me, all over me, covering my legs, my torso, my arms, neck, face. I couldn’t see anything but shifting gaps of light through dozens of tarantula legs. I felt a million pricks of pain erupting on my bare skin. First one bite, then another, then ten more, and my body was exploding in agonizing, excruciating pain, like a million poisoned needles injected into my skin.

I thought for sure I would die at that moment. I didn’t think a body could take that much hurt without simply shutting down. Surely I would pass out at any second, be relieved from that fiery, fiery pain; that sharp and fiery pain.

I was relieved from the pain. But I did not pass out. For through the muffling legs in and on my ears, I heard a low voice humming. Through the pain, I felt a stab of ecstasy. I recognized that melody. It was the one I had been trying so hard to remember for the last God-alone-knows how many months. The one she had taught me. And it seemed I wasn’t the only one who had noticed the melody. For as soon as it started, I felt weight leaving my body, felt the hairy creatures scurrying off of me, shedding like a layer of skin. Eyes free, I saw them crawling toward the source of the voice. But I couldn’t see the source.

Everything was multicolored now, like my eyes were applying a strange filter to it all. My skin was no longer stinging from the bites, but tingling, like when your leg falls asleep, and you feel a million delicate pinpricks. My brain felt like it was rapidly expanding and shrinking. Vision lagging, I truly looked around the area for the first time. Because of the spiders, I hadn’t noticed the strange trees, with feathery webs hanging from them. The trees were changing color, and the bark was shifting in perpetual motion. Once in a while, it looked like they would spell out foreign words, but they never stuck around long enough for me to try and decipher. It seemed I was in a clearing in a large, incomprehensible forest. And I was quickly being abandoned, left alone in a place I couldn’t understand. I saw the last of the spiders disappearing into the trees, following the ever quieting humming that was faintly echoing through the woods, quieter, quieter still, shhhhh.

I was alone in the silence of a strange, hostile place. The colors were deep crimson and black, and the trees were closing in. I no longer feared the spiders. I feared the silence, and the growing darkness. I looked around, trying to remember which direction the spiders had gone. I picked one at random, and went with it. Entered the forest, webs brushing like soft cotton against my cheek. I ran blindly through the shifting trees, tripping over moving vines on the forest floor, picking myself up again, running, running. Trying not to notice the dark patches of fuzz flitting through the canopy above.

Soon, I heard the humming again, as though through a tunnel. It sounded distant, but I hoped against hope that I could catch up to whoever was making the noise. And all of a sudden, just like that, I ran into him. I had been sprinting, and the humming had stopped, and then I collided face-first into the barrel-like chest of an expansive man. I looked up, and towering above me was a face that seemed oddly familiar. I couldn’t place it, but it made me feel warm and happy and unafraid and unalone. He started laughing jovially, his large cheeks growing red. His large grey beard was rippling in strange ways, and I could’ve sworn I saw a hairy leg stick out of it.

“You must be in a bit of a hurry, little man,” he said. Usually, if someone would call me “little man”, I would be confused, and probably take it as a strange insult (considering I’m 6 '1). But the way he said it seemed so friendly, so inviting. I found myself smiling and laughing along. Tears came to my eyes, not sad, nor happy. Rather, bittersweet, like I finally found something I had been missing for a very long time.

“Was that you humming that lovely song?” was all I could say.

“Why of course! Do you know it? Would you like to sing it with me? Would you like to sing it with me, Aidan?”

“Yes! Yes!” I yelled. It felt as though someone had offered me…as though I had died and someone had offered me a ticket back. I felt excited and whole and filled to the brim with expectation. I hadn’t felt so whole since I first heard the song, when something had been taken out from inside of me.

“Now, take it easy, my friend! Let’s see if we can’t find somewhere a little nicer if we’re going to put on a concert.” Before I knew it, we were next to a crystal stream fed by a purple waterfall, each little rivulet tinkling softly as it hit musical stones on the ground. Playing a melody. The melody.

Then we were singing, and there were spiders watching us from the trees, from the webs, but they weren’t angry anymore. They were ecstatic, and I may have been imagining it, but it sounded like they were singing along. His arm around my shoulder, and he singing in his deep bass and me in my tenor:

“If I make it to the halfway tree,
Through the canyon singers’ quay.
Ancient dried up, Godless seas,
Embracing the blue heat.

Cow on stick, and stick in mud.
A token of an ancient flood
The waters part for holy blood
But I am bloodless meat.

Yes, there is where we find true bliss
Where all is sacred, hear the hiss
By Halfway Tree, forever.”

And the song was done, but my ears were still ringing with rapture. The bearded man was smiling like someone I once knew, but I could no longer think of who, and spiders were crawling over his face lovingly. He reached into his dark cloak, and pulled out a colorful mushroom, and handed it to me.

My heart sank. The water had stopped flowing, the music had fully ended, and the spiders had ceased their crawling. They were staring at me again. The man had a look of concern on his face. “Eat it,” he said. “It’s for your own good.”

“I…I don’t know,” I responded. 

When I was five or six, my family and I used to go on hikes a lot, through the deep forest. My family always loved the outdoors. During one of these hikes, my older brother Abe and I were trailing a little bit behind, and he pulled me aside. “Aidan,” he had said. “Look what I found.” He held out a mushroom, beige and sickly looking. “I think this is the kind grandma always gives us. Let’s eat them!” And we did. We ate them, right there, only yards behind the rest of our family. We both became very ill almost immediately. We threw up repeatedly, writhing on the ground in our own vomit, until there was nothing left inside to vomit anymore. We were empty, but we were still dry hacking. The family was around us, screaming, and asking us what happened. My dad was the one who noticed the mushrooms on the ground next to us and our vomit. He called poison control. An ambulance came. The next months went by in a strange and deathly blur. I was sicker than I had ever been before. And as for Abe, he never recovered. He died from those mushrooms. Since then, I had never allowed myself even within eyesight of a mushroom.

And now here was a man who I had trusted, holding out a mushroom for me to eat. “I know what happened,” he said. “I can read it through your eyes. But this is for your own good.” The spiders were slowly crawling toward me again. “They forgot what you did while you sang with me. But no one can hold a grudge like them. They still hate you, and want to see you fall. Nobody hurts one of their sisters and leaves with their life. Unless you eat one of these. I’ve fed these mushrooms to all of them since birth. They’ve grown to associate the smell with friendship. If you eat one of these, you will become a friend, a brother. If you don’t, you will become meat.”

I hesitated. I took a mushroom. The spiders were on me now. It wouldn’t be long before they were biting me again. I might not survive this time. I took a bite of the mushroom. Everything exploded into pure energy and color. I could see sweet violin music zipping through the air, tousling my hair. The spiders were not biting me, but kissing me, stroking their scratchy faces on my skin. I was one of them. The man was laughing loudly, too loudly. 

“Who are you?” I strained to ask him with slurred words, through my cage of color.

“Why, you can call me Mr. Saul,” he said. “And you’ve made a real mistake, son. A real mistake!”

“What? No! You told me to eat the mushroom!”

“That I did! But you took it and ate it yourself. That was your choice! You must leave now. If you make it to the halfway tree, tell Uriel I said hello!” He was laughing too loud, too hard. Still, it sounded like someone I knew, someone from another life. The colors were pulling my eyelids open further than they were meant to go. I was on my back, being carried along by the tarantulas. Through the corner of my bleeding eye, I saw Mr. Saul growing more legs, shifting into something else: a black, black spider, before going up like a mushroom cloud in a dark puff of smoke, laughing all the while. The trees were swaying and their bark was forming into symbols that I felt dirty just for looking at. 

I was being carried along as though I were a lifeless body, floating through a river. I couldn’t control my body, and it was contorting and wiggling, and I thought something was changing, but I could not see what.

1lmaxdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1lmaxdp/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1751074535.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

1lmap9n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmap9n,"June 2025 trip report: late 30s couple, Park MGM, concert","**TL;DR** \- Thank you so much to this group and /LasVegas too! I'm more of a lurker than poster, so researched plenty here to not ask duplicate questions, and watched lots of YouTube videos. You all helped us decide on spots that easily led to some of our highlights of the trip - Park MGM, Bavette's, and Best Friend. The Sphere was amazing. Vegas definitely proved itself as a service town: hotel staff, servers, bartenders, and even Lyft drivers were all incredibly friendly and helpful. We even came out a head a little bit between hotel comps and gambling wins. Didn't get to everything on our list, but that only means we need to make a return trip! Thank you so much again.

**Detailed report** \-we're a couple both nearing 40. It was my 5th time in Vegas (but first in well over 15 years) and my girlfriend's 1st. The impetus was my gift of concert tickets at The Sphere to see Kenny Chesney, one of her favorite artists.

* **Tuesday 6/17**: late-ish flight, checked into Park MGM \~9:30pm. Had a standard king room booked, but it was so late they only had accessible left. For that ""inconvenience"" they comped two nights resort fees, which we gladly accepted and didn't even have to use the “$20 trick”, lol. After dropping off bags & quick change, we had dinner at Best Friend (slippery shrimp and kimchi fried rice were both so delicious, music & vibes in the restaurant were awesome). Walked up the strip to catch Bellagio fountains.
* **Wednesday 6/18**: gf wanted one buffet, so we had Palms AYCE, which was great *value* for the price (we both got bottomless mimosas without the extra $60+ fees at other top end buffets). Walked around the west side some more: Fashion Show Mall, Caesars and Forum Shops, Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens, Aria, Cosmo. Pitstop in the room to rest a bit and change for the concert. Then we grabbed cheap beers at ABC to walk up the east side - MM & PH, past Paris, etc. up to LINQ Promenade for frozen baileys at O'Shea's (and holy crap... in 100+ weather, they hit the spot). Grand Canal Shoppes. Happy hour at Grand Lux Cafe inside Venetian before hitting The Sphere for Kenny. Had seats in the 202 on the left. Absolutely incredible show, and I can see how big concerts are well worth Sphere prices over that movie shown during the day.
   * One tip: if it's a residency, wait for prices to drop, more than you think. I purchased our tickets for $195 each the day before we left for Vegas. Day of the concert there were better seats - about the same row but two sections over more in the middle that would have saved me about $60.
   * After the show, we walked back to Park MGM to gamble a little. I put $50 in Wheel of Fortune slots. Got down to about \~30 left, then hit a jackpot to get me back up to $751!!! Played one more roll to make a clean $750 and quickly cashed out. Winner winner chicken dinner! Know when to walk away.
* **Thursday 6/19**: cheap breakfast at Earl of Sandwich, then Lyft ride to the Arts District. We're both big beer people, so we did a little taster tray crawl at Las Vegas Brewing Company, CraftHaus, and Able Baker. All were great. Quickly checked out Fremont Street, then back to Park MGM for a little gambling before dinner, this time a loser (put down $200 at craps table, walked away with \~$70).
   * Dinner at Bavette's: this is where I made my first mistake. Thought I had 7:45 reservations, but I made them for the wrong day (in July). GF was rightfully upset when we walked out, but I redeemed myself by going back inside for one more quick check at the bar where it was perfect timing, as another couple was getting up to leave on a corner that I snagged.
      * From then on she was fine and the night was amazing. We each had one drink and shared the small bread order, wedge salad, 14oz bone-in NY strip, brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, and lemon meringue pie for dessert. All of it was perfect and insanely delicious. 
      * Corner spot at the bar was great too. We could hear servers & bartenders chatting it up about patrons and a couple behind us at a table were arguing the whole time. Just great eavesdropping all around, lol.
* **Friday 6/20**: this is where I made my second mistake. GF wanted to get late check-out for a while, it was available on both my MGM Rewards app and the in-room TV. I waited too long and both disappeared. She was upset again, thinking they were all out. But, I went down to the front desk to check. Was very polite (and maybe a little desperate in my voice, lol). Front desk woman saw we were in an accessible room, and moved us to 1pm and comped the $50 fee. Redeemed myself again.
   * Then we spent a few hours at the pool for breakfast. Originally thought to do Primrose and then pool time, but skipped that and headed straight to the pool. We split the breakfast burrito from the pool menu, plenty for two people. That plus two coffees was cheaper than Primrose. So, it worked out great. We also splurged on two rounds of pool drinks, frozen daiquiris were good.
   * Shower, packed, checked out, and dropped off bags at the bell desk. 
   * Then we hit up our final activity and checked out the Grand Prix Plaza (we’re both F1 fans). Cool photos of the starting grid, pit lane, browsed the store, and I did the $39 racing sims, which was a blast. 
   * Made our way back to the hotel via the Cosmo for lunch at Secret Pizza and drinks at Chandelier. Both were so good. Then one last round at Eataly - aperol spritz for her, Peroni for me. Some final gambling, where I tried out bubble craps. Won about $30. $3 minimum bets are much more my speed than $15 table mins. Then we grabbed our bags and headed to the airport. 

**Final notes:**

* **Park MGM:** total for 3 nights was about $250 after the $150 in comps. Picked it for the food options & non-smoking aspect which you all mentioned, and it was the right choice. To me it also felt more upscale than its mid-tier price would suggest, punched well above its weight. My past stays in Vegas were Circus Circus, Riviera and MGM Grand. Park was clean, refreshing, and easy to navigate (especially from entrance to guest elevators).
   * To save a little $, I’d be interested in renovated rooms at NYNY in the future. Or if I wanted to splurge, Aria (maybe Circa downtown for a big sporting event at Stadium Swim)... but Park MGM might be our go-to. It was that great. 
* **Bavette’s:** holy cow did this place live up to the billing, at least in our experience. TYSM for the recs. All in was about $285 for the two of us, including a great tip to our bartender. We’ll definitely eat here again, for the burger and french dip sandwich next time. 
* **Costs:** spent about $900 all said on food & drink. Not the best, but less than I thought we would. Next time we’ll seek out more HHs and other deals - STK, Beerhaus, etc. $113 in Lyft rides and the concert was $390 for two tickets.
   * Neither of us are big gamblers. My budget was $600, hers $400, and neither of us spent all that. Plus my $720 jackpot. 
* **Next time(s):** more activities from our list we didn’t get to. I wanted Meow Wolf, she wanted the High Roller Happy Half Hour, we both wanted Mob Museum. Just couldn’t fit it in. Other “hidden” bars like Ski Lodge, Craft Creamery, the one at Mob Museum, etc. Maybe a show like Absinthe or Zombie Burlesque. 

All in all, this trip reminded me why I like Vegas. Great food, drinks, fun gambling, amazing service. I’m a big city person too - some of my favorite cities are San Francisco, NY, Philly, etc. and Vegas is like that. But I can handle lounging around and not doing anything (reading a book on the beach in the BVIs a long time ago was better than I thought). So, the Park MGM pool was great to unwind for both of us after work stress. It had been a while since we took a trip (DC a couple years ago).

Along with two other notes, a suspicious photo someone tagged him in from a private Facebook profile (which had since been deleted), and a red silk scarf that definitely wasn't hers.
""I made a mistake.""
She let out a quiet laugh. 
""Which one?""
He blinked. That landed.
""I thought... I thought Candace was something different. But I realize now it was just an escape. A fantasy. I was drowning and instead of reaching for you, I—""
""Chose someone else.""
He looked down. ""Yes.""
Emily turned to him. ""You didn't just cheat on me, Nathan. You abandoned me. While I was trying to fix us, you were out lying with someone who didn't even know the first thing about who you really are.""
Nathan opened his mouth, then closed it again. He had no defense. Not anymore.
""I don't know if we can come back from this,"" she said finally. ""I'm not sure I even want to.""
______________
 
The morning light slipped through the linen curtains like a secret, soft and golden, wrapping everything in a glow that could almost convince you nothing in the world was broken.
Emily Whitaker stirred in bed, her eyes still closed, listening to the faint hum of the espresso machine downstairs and the occasional chirp of birds outside. The duvet smelled like lavender and something clean-like comfort, like home. She reached a hand over the pillow beside her and found... emptiness. Cold sheets.
Again.
She opened her eyes slowly. The king-sized bed looked too big without Nathan in it. Too white, too crisp, too untouched. His side might as well have belonged to a ghost. A neatly pressed indent marked where he had once lain, or maybe hadn't.
Emily sat up, brushing a strand of hair from her face, trying to chase away the quick sting in her chest.
Maybe he left early for work.
Maybe he didn't want to wake me.
Maybe-
God, she was tired of maybes.
She stood and slipped into her robe, the satin sash whispering against her skin as she moved toward the en-suite bathroom. Her reflection met her in the mirror-hazel eyes shadowed with sleeplessness, lips chapped from nervous biting, the faintest crease forming between her brows. She used to call it her ""thinking line."" Now it was permanent.
As she brushed her teeth, she caught sight of a note tucked into the mirror frame. Nathan's handwriting-slanted, charmingly careless.
""Breakfast downstairs. Meeting at 7:30. Love you. - N""
It should've been comforting. It wasn't.
She traced the words with her finger. ""Love you."" Three syllables that used to feel like sunrise, now hollow as an abandoned church.
Downstairs, the kitchen smelled of cinnamon toast and espresso. The counter was immaculately clean, just like everything Nathan touched. A small plate of toast, one slice already eaten. Two cups-only one half-drunk.
He had been here.
She picked up the mug, still warm, and held it between her palms like it might give her answers. But there were none, just the same weight in her chest she'd been carrying for months. Years, maybe.
---
At that very moment, Nathan Whitaker sat in a conference room downtown, laughing too loudly at something his assistant said. The room was sleek, all chrome and glass, and Nathan fit in perfectly with his tailored suit, Rolex catching the light like a blade.
The man was handsome-undeniably so-with stormy gray eyes and the kind of smile that could charm anyone into forgiveness. Emily had fallen for that smile once, long before she learned it could be a mask.
As he scrolled through his phone, a text popped up:
>""Last night was amazing. Can't wait to feel your hands on me again.  - C""
He smirked, locked the phone, and sipped his coffee.
Later that morning, Emily drove their daughter, Lily, to school. The five-year-old chattered away in the backseat, recounting a dream about flying unicorns and chocolate rain. Emily smiled, nodding, but her mind was miles away.
She dropped Lily off with a peck to the forehead, whispering ""be brave, be kind,"" like she did every morning. Then she sat alone in the car for several minutes, engine off, eyes on the steering wheel.
Be brave, be kind.
She could teach it. But living it? That was harder.
Flashback - 6 Years Ago
Their wedding had been a dream. White roses cascading down the altar, vows spoken with watery eyes, a first dance that felt like floating.
""He looks at you like you're magic,"" her maid of honor had said, fanning herself with a napkin.
And he had. Back then.
They used to lie in bed at night planning baby names, future vacations, and even the color they'd paint the nursery someday. They had intercourse slowly, reverently-like they were building something sacred.
But time, Emily had learned, could be cruel to sacred things.
Present Day
By noon, Emily sat in the café where she wrote freelance articles-a side gig that was more about sanity than money. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, unmoving.
How do you write about healthy relationships when yours feels like a slow implosion?
Her phone buzzed.
Nathan: ""Dinner tonight? Thinking Italian. Just us?""
She stared at the message, bile creeping up her throat. Italian. Their favorite. Or rather, hers. He always let her pick, always made it seem like she had a choice.
Me: Sure.
One word. That's all she could give today.
That night, she wore the navy dress he liked. The one with the open back. Her makeup was soft, her hair curled just so. A beautiful lie wrapped in silk and mascara.
They sat at a candle-lit table, sipping red wine. He told stories from work, exaggerated slightly for flair. She laughed in the right places. She always did.
But beneath the table, her fists clenched in her lap. Because as he spoke, she noticed him glance at his phone under the table. A quick flash of a name she didn't recognize.
Candace.
Emily's throat tightened.
She didn't say anything. Not yet. But something inside her shifted. Not a break, not yet-but a bending. Like the first tremor before the earthquake.
She would go home with him tonight. She would lie beside him again. He might touch her, maybe even with tenderness. They would peck. They might have intercourse.
But nothing would feel real.
Because something had changed.
And though she couldn't name it yet, karma had already begun its slow crawl. Its teeth were still hidden, but they were there. Sharpening.
 
The hum of the dishwasher filled the kitchen as Emily stood motionless at the sink, her fingers buried in a soapy plate she'd long since stopped scrubbing. Outside, the world looked serene—early spring sunlight casting a filtered glow through budding branches—but inside her chest, a storm churned low and quiet.
She was stuck in that hollow hour between dinner and bedtime when everything felt too loud and too quiet all at once. Nathan had retreated to his office—""just finishing up a pitch,"" he'd said—while Lily sprawled out on the living room floor coloring with her headphones on.
Emily wanted to scream.
Not out loud. Just... inside. The kind of scream you push down with smiles and dinner plans, where no one can hear it but you.
She rinsed the plate and placed it carefully into the rack, her mind still on the text she'd seen the night before. Candace.
The name was too new, too sharp. Not one of his coworkers—at least not one she'd ever heard him mention. But it had flashed so clearly on his phone under the table, she could still see it when she closed her eyes. Just like that time six months ago—another name, another late text. Always a new lie wrapped in a casual shrug.
She wasn't ready to confront him. Not yet. Something in her needed more than intuition. She needed proof. Tangible. Undeniable. Because Nathan was a master at dancing around the truth—he'd turn any accusation into an indictment of her.
She'd heard the phrases too many times:
""You're overreacting.""
""You're just being paranoid again.""
""You always ruin good nights like this.""
And each time, she swallowed her doubts like poison. Until now.
---
Flashback - Three Weeks Earlier
Emily had borrowed Nathan's car after hers wouldn't start. He was out of town—Boston for a sales convention—and had told her to go ahead and use the Range Rover.
She didn't mean to find it. Truly. She was looking for the car registration when her fingers brushed against something folded in the glove compartment.
A receipt.
Hotel Lumière. Downtown. Two nights. Room 809.
Dated during the trip he claimed had ended a day earlier.
The hotel was local. So much for Boston.
She'd held the paper like it was burning her fingertips. Her first instinct had been to crumple it and scream. Her second? To tuck it away. Hide it. Like she had with so many other suspicions.
She never confronted him about that receipt. Not yet. But now, she had it hidden in a shoebox in the back of her closet. Along with two other notes, a suspicious photo someone tagged him in from a private Facebook profile (which had since been deleted), and a red silk scarf that definitely wasn't hers.
A little evidence box of heartbreak.
---
Present Day
Emily opened the pantry and stared at the shelves, not seeing the cans and boxes. Just the widening void of her own reality unraveling.
Nathan used to look at her like she was the only thing in the world that made sense. Now, she wasn't even sure he saw her at all.
She didn't cry. Not yet.
Instead, she closed the pantry door and pulled out her phone.
She opened a private Instagram account she'd made weeks ago under a fake name—an idea from her therapist, Dr. Amina Welles, who once said, ""If you're afraid to confront him yet, then at least start gathering your version of the truth. Even if it's only for yourself.""
So Emily followed the crumbs. She searched hashtags and tagged locations, often scrolling late into the night with trembling fingers and a blank stare. The one she'd found this time—a photo of a woman clinking glasses with a man in a dim bar—had a hand suspiciously like Nathan's. The watch was the same. So were the cufflinks.
She screenshotted it, heart pounding. Another puzzle piece.
God, it felt like she was going mad.
---
Nathan leaned back in his leather chair, the room bathed in amber from the vintage lamp on his desk. He wasn't working—not really. His laptop screen was still on the same spreadsheet he'd opened twenty minutes ago. Instead, he was texting.
> C: ""Miss you already. You drive me crazy ""
He smirked, typing back quickly.
> N: ""Next Friday? Tell your boss you need a long lunch ""
He was careful. Always had been. Passwords changed regularly. Pictures deleted. Candace was a newer fling, younger, easily impressed. With Candace, he didn't have to pretend to be a perfect husband. He could just be... free.
Or at least, that's what he told himself.
---
The next night, they went to Lily's school for a spring performance. The auditorium buzzed with excited parents, the smell of popcorn and crayons hanging in the air.
Emily wore a soft yellow blouse Nathan once said made her look ""like morning."" She'd ironed it three times to calm her nerves.
Nathan was charming as always—greeting the other dads with easy confidence, rubbing Emily's lower back possessively when people looked. But when no one was watching, his touch disappeared.
On stage, Lily stood front row in a hand-sewn daffodil costume, her smile brighter than the lights above her.
Emily clapped until her palms stung.
Halfway through the performance, Nathan leaned over and whispered, ""Be right back.""
She nodded absently, eyes glued to Lily.
But twenty minutes passed. Then thirty. The show ended. Parents filtered out.
Nathan never returned to his seat.
When she found him outside by the car, he was on his phone, voice low and urgent.
He flinched when he saw her. ""Work,"" he lied. ""I had to take it.""
Emily just nodded, her hands ice cold.
She didn't ask any questions.
Because she was done asking.
---
Emily lay awake long after Nathan fell asleep. His back to her, breath deep and even. She watched the ceiling, counting the tiny cracks in the paint, her hands gripping the sheet like it could tether her to this reality.
She didn't want to believe he was cheating, again.
She wanted to believe this was a rough patch. A marriage gone stale. A man with stress. She wanted to believe the man she married still existed somewhere inside this stranger.
But wanting didn't make it true.
She quietly slipped out of bed and walked barefoot to the closet. Pulled down the shoebox.
She added tonight's screenshot to the folder she was compiling.
Then she sat in the closet and cried for the first time in weeks.
Not because of Nathan.
But because she still wanted him to come home, even though he never really left.
---
Flashback — 2 Years Ago
They were at the beach. Just the two of them. Lily at her parents' house.
It was sunset. They walked along the shoreline, their feet buried in the cool sand.
Nathan had pecked her shoulder and whispered, ""I'd marry you all over again, you know?""
She'd laughed and said, ""You're just trying to get laid.""
He'd replied, ""Not tonight. I just want to hold you.""
And he had.
That version of him—real or not—had been hers once.
That's what made this betrayal unbearable.
---
Present
By morning, Emily knew what she had to do.
She wasn't ready to confront him—not until she was safe. Not until she had everything she needed.
But she would protect herself. Her daughter.
And she would stop pretending.
 
The first whisper came in the middle of the night.
It wasn't a voice. Not really. It was the silence. Heavy. Breathing. Pressed up against her like the weight of truth she no longer had the strength to ignore.
Emily lay wide-eyed in the darkness, the ceiling fan spinning above like a lazy clock. Beside her, Nathan slept soundly, one arm flung across his pillow, mouth parted slightly. He looked peaceful. Innocent.
But Emily knew better.
She hadn't slept. Not really. For weeks, sleep came in short, fractured segments—interrupted by nightmares, cold sweats, and the slow realization that the life she'd built was becoming a house of mirrors. Everything looked intact until you looked too closely.
Now she lay still, heart thudding against her ribs like a warning.
She had found another receipt tucked in the side pocket of his gym bag earlier that day. A boutique hotel in the city—The Vesper. Another weekday. Another lie.
She didn't confront him. She didn't scream.
She made dinner. She smiled when Lily showed her a drawing of a rainbow cat. She let Nathan peck her cheek as he passed behind her, the casual, performative affection of a man who thought his stage was still secure.
Emily no longer knew what was worse—his betrayal, or the ease with which he continued to wear the mask.
---
Nathan sat in his car outside work the next morning, staring at his phone. He'd received a text from Candace at 3:12 a.m.
> ""Can't stop thinking about you. Wish you were here.""
He should've felt guilty. A sliver of shame, at least. But all he felt was exhaustion.
It wasn't that he didn't love Emily. He did. In some way. Or maybe he loved the memory of her—the version of them that existed before life became so routine.
Before she started looking through him instead of at him.
Candace made him feel wanted again. Alive. The way Emily used to.
But Nathan didn't consider himself a cheater. Not in the real sense. Not like those stories in tabloids or movies. He wasn't heartless. He still came home. He still played with Lily. He still paid the mortgage.
He was a good husband. Wasn't he?
---
Emily sat in Dr. Welles' office, the soft scent of eucalyptus in the air doing little to calm her nerves. She held a tissue in one hand, fingers trembling around it like it might dissolve in her grasp.
""I feel like I'm dying from the inside out,"" she whispered.
Dr. Welles nodded gently, her voice measured. ""Tell me more.""
Emily stared at her lap. ""It's like... every time I look at him, I see a stranger. But I still wait for him to come back. The man I married. The man who used to make coffee just the way I like it, who used to call me beautiful without needing a reason.""
""And now?""
""Now he lies. And I let him.""
""You're protecting yourself,"" Dr. Welles said softly. ""Your brain is buying time until your heart catches up.""
Emily looked up, tears brimming. ""I'm scared. I keep collecting proof like I'm building a case. Like if I have enough, it'll hurt less when it all falls apart.""
Dr. Welles tilted her head. ""What are you most afraid of, Emily?""
Emily's voice cracked. ""That it won't fall apart. That I'll stay. That I'll keep letting him do this.""
---
At dinner, the air in the Whitaker's home felt brittle.
Lily chatted about school. Nathan nodded along, asking polite questions in between forkfuls of risotto. Emily watched him, searching his face for signs of the man she once trusted.
He wore a clean white dress shirt, sleeves rolled to his elbows. The veins in his forearms, once so familiar to her, now seemed like roads leading to places she could never follow.
""How was work?"" she asked.
Nathan blinked, caught off guard. ""Same as usual. Boring meetings.""
Emily nodded. ""You were at The Vesper yesterday, right?""
There it was. A fissure in his composure. So small, so fast, anyone else might've missed it. But not her. She caught the slight pause. The second it took for his brain to reach for a lie.
""Oh—uh—yeah,"" he said. ""Client meeting. Last-minute change of venue.""
Emily took a sip of water. ""Must've been a nice room.""
Nathan didn't respond.
Lily dropped her fork. ""Oops!""
The tension cracked, redirected.
Emily smiled at her daughter, but behind her eyes, storm clouds gathered.
---
After Lily was in bed, Emily stood in front of the mirror brushing her hair. Nathan came up behind her, hands slipping around her waist.
""You were quiet tonight,"" he murmured, pressing a peck to her neck.
Emily flinched, almost imperceptibly.
""Tired,"" she said.
""Come to bed,"" he said against her skin. ""I miss you.""
She met his eyes in the mirror. The lie was right there. In his pupils. In the way his fingers gripped her like a reflex, not desire.
She let him lead her to bed.
And when he touched her—gently, rhythmically, the way he thought she liked—she stared at the ceiling, letting her mind drift.
She didn't resist. She didn't cry.
She just... disappeared.
---
Nathan sat in his office, scrolling through emails. Candace was getting clingy. She'd sent three messages already, asking when they could meet again. She was beautiful, yes. But messy. Too emotional. Starting to ask too many questions.
He was tired.
There was a time when cheating felt thrilling. Dangerous. Like a dope. But now? It just felt like quicksand.
His phone buzzed again. A fourth message.
> ""Are you ghosting me? I thought this meant something.""
Nathan sighed.
He minimized the message and opened a new tab to book a hotel room for Friday. Not The Vesper this time. Somewhere different. Somewhere she wouldn't suspect.
---
Emily stared at the name: Candace Fields.
She'd finally found her. After weeks of digital digging. A LinkedIn profile, a Twitter account with no posts but a recognizable photo, and finally—an open Facebook gallery with a dozen photos of her and Nathan. All cropped, all implied, but all damning.
In one, he was just a reflection in her wine glass.
In another, a blurred shoulder and jawline. But Emily knew that jaw.
She saved them all.
One by one.
Then she did something she hadn't done in years.
She opened a blank document and started to write—not an article, not a list of facts, not a financial breakdown of the Hartleys' future—but a letter.
> To the woman who has been sleeping with my husband,
I'm not here to shame you. I just want you to know who he really is.
You're not the only one he lies to.
She stopped. Deleted it.
Instead, she closed the laptop and whispered into the silence: ""You're not winning. Not this time.""
---
That night, Emily pecked Lily goodnight and lingered in the doorway, watching her daughter breathe softly beneath her pink quilt. She thought about legacy. About what kind of woman she was teaching Lily to become.
Brave. Or quiet.
Kind. Or obedient.
The difference mattered more now than ever.
In the hallway, Nathan called for her.
She didn't answer.
She stood in the dark, listening to the house breathe. Knowing that soon, it would all come undone.
But not yet.
Not until she was ready.
Not until she had everything.",1,1751073812.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

1lmamu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/migrainescience/comments/1lmamu3/could_migraine_be_adaptive/,Could migraine be adaptive?,"Hi everyone, I recently discovered this sub and it has been very useful. I hope it's alright for a lay person to post a theory here; if it's not insightful I don't think anyone will read it anyway. I don't have training in the relevant science, but I do have a background in engineering, so I'm used to thinking through things carefully.

 

# Theory Introduction



Migraines are miserable. But I wonder if they might be a state that is helpful in *neurological emergencies.* Like a fire alarm in the brain. For this to be true it would need to be the case that, in some extreme conditions, things will actually get worse if we don’t get a migraine. As unpleasant as they are, having a migraine absolutely compels you to do all the behaviors which make the situation better. That situation is that your brain is overwhelmed with *mental stimulation* and truly is at risk of injury if it tries to do even more.

 

Think about what feels best when you do have a migraine: laying in a cool, dark, quiet room alone. These are also the same conditions that are ideal for sleep. Because many signals are so automatically processed by the brain that it cannot choose to simply shut them off. It can only turn down the volume of those signals a bit. But when you're asleep, if you hear a loud noise or someone shines a flashlight in your face, or you feel a sharp pain, you will wake up. And think of the things that often cause insomnia: an abundance of thoughts (racing mind), unusual emotional distress, stimulants too late at night (coffee). It's not a coincidence that these are all things that can *contribute* to having a migraine.

 

# Possible Usefulness of Symptoms



Back to how a migraine could be useful, it compels you in several different ways to seek out the *lowest stimulation environment* possible. I'll just use my own migraine symptoms as examples, yours might be different.

 

**Pain**

Compels you to lie down and take it easy.

 

**Sensitivity to light and sound**

Compels you to avoid or diminish light and sound as much as possible. Both require a lot of processing by the brain and the louder the signal is the more taxing it is to make sense of.

 

**Increased social anxiety**

Compels you to get out of social situations as much as possible, at least for the time being. This lowers the work that needs to be done by the network of brain regions that enable social cognition (social brain)

 

**Increased Irritation with people and tasks**

Compels you to get away from the annoying people or give up on the aggravating task. Either one will allow your brain to rest more.

 

**Increased Pessimism/Negativity**

Compels you to give up on your projects today. Not generally good, but as a temporary measure it can give you time to focus on immediate recovery.

 

**Acute Depression/Sadness**

Pushes you towards a low energy state in general.

 

I know '*Acute Depression'* is not a medically recognized term because the diagnostic criteria for depression involves it lasting for at least a couple of weeks. But I think all the symptoms of depression can have a *rapid onset*, especially among people with a history of depression and for whom the depression network is well established.

 

**Increased thirst**

Compels you to drink more water, which the body uses to cool the brain and thereby reduce inflammation. It doesn't necessarily mean you were dehydrated before the migraine, but if you can go through water as quickly as possible right now that will help the 'water cooling of the brain'.

 

**Confusion (brain fog)**

I don't know if the thinky thinky parts of the brain actually calm down, or if they just choose to send your consciousness (executive) fewer thoughts in order to ease the traffic jam that's going on in your brain. I can see how either fewer thoughts or a greater proportion of subconscious thoughts would be helpful.

 

**Craving for certain foods (especially in early stages)**

I find I have increased cravings for foods that happen to have an established neuroprotective benefit. Like a handful of mixed berries, nuts and seeds, dark chocolate, or green tea.

 



Okay, that's definitely a long enough post. Please let me know if parts of this sound right or wrong. I do want to improve my thinking on this, so that I have actual insight into how migraines function. Thank you even if you scanned this over.

 

^(Note on terms:)

^(I consider 'mental stimulation' to be inherently neutral. Think of seeing sunlight; there is nothing inherently good or bad about it. So, migraine can happen when you are having a great day and doing all the things you enjoy and care about. Or it can happen when you're having a terrible day and are assailed by negative emotions. The 'feeling tone' of the mental stimulation doesn't really matter here.)",0,1751073604.0,migrainescience,2,0.5,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Washington Nationals vs. Los Angeles Angels: A Tale of Two Teams, One Disastrous Rotation**  
*June 27, 2025 | Angel Stadium | 9:38 PM ET*

**The Setup:**  
The Washington Nationals (33-48) are here to remind us that 28th in ERA (4.97) and 24th in WHIP (1.381) is not a recipe for success. The Los Angeles Angels (40-40), meanwhile, are here to remind us that 118 home runs and a 62.5% win rate when favored is a *very* good recipe for success.

**Key Players & Stats:**

* **Jake Irvin (Nats):** 6-3, 4.18 ERA. A pitcher who’s better than his record but still worse than a bowl of lukewarm oatmeal.
* **José Soriano (Angels):** 5-5, 3.39 ERA. A solid arm who’s better than Irvin and about 100% better than the Nationals’ offense.
* **Offense:** Angels rank 4th in MLB in HRs (118), while the Nationals’ James Wood (22 HRs) is their only hope to avoid being outscored by a coffee table.

**The Odds Breakdown:**

* **Moneyline:** Angels -210, Nationals +190
* **Spread:** Angels -1.5 (-200), Nationals +1.5 (+150)
* **Total:** Over 9.5 (-110), Under 9.5 (-110)

**The Sarcasm Meter is Off the Charts:**  
The Angels are favored by 1.5 runs, which is generous given their recent 3-0 streak and the Nationals’ 1-3 skid. The Nationals’ pitching staff is so bad that even a game against a team of 12-year-olds would result in a 10-run deficit. Meanwhile, the Angels’ offense is so good that they could probably hit a home run off a brick wall.

**Injury Notes (or Lack Thereof):**  
No major injuries reported. The only “injury” the Nationals have is their dignity, which was lost in a 2023 game against the Miami Marlins.

**The Data-Driven Best Bet:**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like we’re trying to escape a math class.

1. **Moneyline Implied Probabilities:**
   * Angels: 210/(100+210) = **67.7%**
   * Nationals: 100/(100+190) = **34.5%**
2. **Adjust for Underdog Win Rate (41% in MLB):**
   * Nationals’ adjusted probability: (34.5% + 41%)/2 = **37.7%**
   * Angels’ adjusted probability: 67.7% (

1lmam6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuroraCO/comments/1lmam6i/i_want_to_thank_this_subreddit_and_community_and/,I want to thank this subreddit and community and the real life city of Aurora for being so welcoming to me,"Hello all, I’ve not posted here in a bit, and I’ve only posted here in total like 3 or maybe 4 times going back to April, so many of you probably won’t remember me. For those who do it’s me again! And for those who don’t, I’m a 35 year old trans woman from Texas who recently moved here from there.

These last few months have been a (mostly good) roller coaster. I didn’t know what the future in Colorado held for me, but I told myself that Aurora meaning “dawn” in Latin meant something, and it does. My confidence has gone up tremendously. I walk down the street now with confidence and not constantly looking over my shoulder, wondering if people can tell I’m trans and if they’re judging me about it if they can, or if they’ll do something worse than just staring.

Since I’ve arrived here, I haven’t noticed a single side eye or lingering stare, and I haven’t been misgendered once, ANYWHERE since I’ve moved here from that other place, and that includes days where I was lazy and wasn’t even making an effort to look feminine, with things like sweat pants and an oversized hoodie, hair a mess and no makeup, and sometimes a ball cap even.

I was desperate and moved here with basically nothing. Most of my big stuff is still in Texas because my roommates there are literal angels in human form, and they allowed me to come back at a later yet undecided date to pick it up. I made a pretty lengthy post on fb in an episcopal group I’m a member of, and a particular woman I’d never spoken to before reached out to me and offered me her living room. No money or strings, just a 100% safe and secure place to start over and blossom again, and I jumped on it.

Since arriving here I’ve been nothing short of amazed at the good nature of most Coloradans, even if the problem from Texas of jackass drivers on the road seems to have followed me here lol.

I thought I was coming to stay with a couple who maybe didn’t have the most resources or money but were genuinely good people and wanted to help. If there has ever been something that was understated in the history of the world, this thought of mine was it. Because actually what happened, the day I arrived here I was driven behind the protection of a literal army. Before I even knew what happened, I had people literally surrounding me wanting to help.

A nonprofit I didn’t even reach out to contacted me and said they wanted to help me into my own apartment. They wanted to put me in Denver proper because they said not that Aurora is bad, but Denver is even better for someone in your circumstance. If you feel safe walking in Aurora, wait until you see Denver.

But by now I have seen Denver, and it’s true. Never seen so many pride flags, but it’s not just Denver. My job in Broomfield (I’m a CNA working in a skilled nursing facility) had their annual pride day on Tuesday. I didn’t work, but when I came back Thursday there were pride flags everywhere inside and rainbow stuff kind of everywhere, and this is in a facility that caters mostly to seniors and elderly. And when I say I haven’t been misgendered at all I’m including at work and I’m including all these residents who “come from a different time”. My work and how I was treated was one of the hardest things about Texas, and hell would’ve frozen over before a single one of my facilities had a “pride day”. Also, the city government of Broomfield had a flag raising ceremony in which they raised the progress Pride flag at city hall on June 2nd.

Since arriving here I had another transition milestone, I used the women’s bathroom at a new place I’d never been to before where I didn’t know anybody. Granted this particular instance was in Denver, but still.

To say my confidence has increased here would be a massive understatement. I really can’t put it to words. While I am not and will never be ashamed of my trans identity, I am feeling less trans and more “just like a woman” everyday. Colorado and specifically Aurora, Denver and Broomfield have shown me that a woman’s life is not only possible for me, but it’s here already staring me in the face.

I have acquired the apartment, and I’m set to move in on Tuesday July 1st. The nonprofit has promised 6 months of rent and even already paid my first month rent and security deposit to move in. I had to make my puppy a ESA so I could bring her but still, that’ll end up being a good thing and open up more conveniences for me later. They also have acquired some donations of furniture for me. Things like a bed and tv stand, a coffee table and some nightstands, a stand for my bearded dragons tank, and some other things. I also have commitments from a couple of them to help move, and they’re also paying for the moving van and the relevant fees, as well as getting me some groceries to start out, because while I got my first check from job just a few days ago and while it was nearly $1300, I was incredibly behind on some stuff including my HRT which I’m almost out of and needed to refill, and after getting caught up on everything I have less than $100 left.

When I found out I was moving here, which was less than 2 days before I actually drove up because the mental health crisis I’d had in Texas which was the worst in over a decade and led to me actually having a plan for suicide, resulting in my then current job sending literal police to my home to do a wellness check, the process during which they of course repeatedly deadnamed and misgendered me, I scared myself so badly that I knew I couldn’t live like that anymore, and I could never go back to that very dark place. I didn’t want to, and I intended to avoid it all costs. So when this woman reached out to me, I was full speed ahead, yes, LFG.

Anyway after I talked to her but before I actually left, I made a post here on this very sub introducing myself and saying I was moving here and why, and wondering how Aurora is for people like me, and the responses were nothing short of awesome.

My next chapter in Colorado begins in just a few days, and thank you to all of you for being there and in my corner, supporting me, and being my cheerleaders in the shadows. I truly believe if I didn’t leave Texas exactly when I did, I would be dead by my own hand right now. I had a 6 hour conversation with a friend right whenever all that was happening and he didn’t succeed in talking me off the ledge, and right after that this woman contacted me. In the post, I didn’t even say anything about wanting to leave Texas, I just was detailed about everything that was affecting me and I asked for prayers and encouragement. The result was this woman who didn’t know me from Eve, sending me a message that basically was “want to come to Colorado and stay on my couch?”. Of course we talked more in depth before I actually left, but still I was humbled and amazed.

I don’t want to keep dragging this out, I’m just so thankful for this city and the good people in it, I really truly believe that in your own way, every last one of yall saved my life.

1lmam1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1lmam1w/graduating_from_sr_my_experience/,"Graduating from SR, my experience","Hi everyone, I recently made a post about being ""forced"" to break my 14-month streak due to deciding to have a baby with my wife, and while I appreciate all the support, it has been pointed out to me that I probably have a lot of lessons to share with this great community.

**Yes, I did have sex while on SR:** I feel like this ""version"" of sex is 10x better than ""regular"" sex. The stamina, the energy, and the overall enjoyment for both parties go through the roof!

**How to have sex while on SR:** The best piece of advice I can give you is to not practice ""edging,"" ESPECIALLY with a partner involved. Aside from the fact that it is dangerous and overall bad for your health (do your research, stop coping, guys), it just downgrades the experience so much. What I recommend instead is that when you believe you are even starting to be close to finishing, just *stop* that motion or tell your partner to stop. If you're afraid of it ""killing the mood,"" you can try non-verbal ways (my favorites, tbh) to do so. if she's on top, lift her up and switch positions; take a few seconds to catch your breath. If she's giving you head, pull her by the hair (look into the proper way vs. the improper way to do so by Stirling Cooper) and make out with her a bit, or kiss her neck, or do something else. If you feel like you need more time, try other ways of making it enjoyable for your partner (non-penetrative sex is a lot of times just as enjoyable as penetrative sex to women).

**Benefits:** Where do I start. After the 30-day mark, it really became apparent to me that the benefits were real (I just checked, and I met my wife around day 70-ish haha). For me, the biggest thing in terms of quality of life was not crashing after meals; this used to force me to drink a coffee every day and is something I do not do anymore! Aside from that, confidence is at an all-time high. I carried myself a bit better and really felt an impact at work. I stopped second-guessing myself a lot on minor things and felt a noticeable improvement in the relationships I had with my female co-workers. It also helped me a lot in the gym. I was already at a size I liked (98kg at 187 cm), but I noticed it was a lot easier to maintain body fat. Before, if I went out with my friends or had a six-pack with them on the weekend, I did notice an effect on body fat (after all, it's around 2k+ calories, haha), but I really burned a lot more calories, and especially towards the end of the 1st year, my wife noticed she had to start cooking a bit more food than before and even had to buy a bigger lunch box for me to take to work.

**Advice:**

**-** Dont do edging; it fries your brain just as much as releasing every day

\- Get a tracker! As I mentioned before, I really enjoy answering the ""did you masturbate or watch porn? question every day on my phone and letting it know that NO, I did NOT do it. It never gets old or boring, even after 30, 100, or even 300 days.

**Notes:** Yes, my wife does prepare me lunch for work. And yes, I do brag about it at the office when someone makes fun of me.",7,1751073534.0,Semenretention,0,0.89,False

1lmai9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lmai9r/theres_a_corpse_in_the_freezer_at_work/,There's a Corpse in the Freezer at Work,"Across many ancient religions, blood was considered sacred. The Mesopotamians believed humans were formed from the blood of a slain god. In Greek mythology, the divine blood of the gods—called ichor—held supernatural properties. And perhaps most famously, Levitical law in the Torah forbids the consumption of animal blood, declaring it the seat of life.

These are just a few of many examples, but the point is clear: there’s something about blood we don’t fully understand.

I work in a bioanalytical lab, where my job is to analyze blood and plasma for drug levels, diseases, or whatever else my boss says we’re after. Or at least, that’s what I signed up for. Most days, I’m just pulling plasma samples for hours. Easy work. But monotonous. Repetitive.

We store the samples in a walk-in freezer, locked with a heavy latch, until the day before we need them. Then we line them up on the counters before we leave, so they’ll thaw overnight and be ready by the next shift.

This is my first job like this, and the one thing I wasn’t prepared for was the smell. Plasma stinks. Not like excrement—nothing sharp or sour. It’s a sickly sweet odor that clings to the air. Every breath brings the stench of pus. Breathing through your mouth doesn’t help. It just means you taste it.

I’ve grown to hate plasma. It’s the liquid part of blood, but don’t imagine something clean or clear. It varies from sample to sample—colors ranging from bright red to dark amber, to orange, to a jaundiced yellow. Some look almost translucent. Others are thick, polluted, with solid chunks drifting inside like jellyfish in a jar. I hate them the most. 

Taking samples means handling racks and racks of empty vials. I work through them one by one: take a bottle, pry it open with metal tongs, and squeeze out the disgusting concoction until each tube is half full.

I’ve gotten chunks on my gloves more than once. Every time, I insist on changing them. Without the surrounding liquid, the solid bits look like fleshy snot.

Still, the job isn’t all bad. I share a bench with one other guy—Francis. He’s a year younger than me, but he’s been here longer—about nine months. It took a bit to warm up to each other on my first day, but once we did, we’d joke and trade stories as we sampled and labeled bottles.

He told me about his family, about this absurdly rich couple he sometimes house-sits for—how they pay him stupid amounts of money to do practically nothing. 

And then there’s his favorite: the ghost that supposedly haunts the lab. According to him, it opens boxes, undoes the freezer latch, and bangs on the inside wall when you’re too deep in thought to notice. 

Our manager knows the ghost story too. It’s mostly a joke—an easy excuse when one of us forgets something or leaves the freezer door cracked.

But I did hear the noises a few times while Francis was still around. Nothing worth writing home about. Just soft knocks or the faint clink of a latch shifting. The kind of thing you'd chalk up to the building settling.

Then, a few weeks ago, Francis stopped showing up. No call, no notice. Just gone. Very unlike him. He’s got a family to support, and this job was his main source of income. 

But things happen, you know? Maybe he had some emergency, found a better job. Hell, maybe he won the lottery and decided to say screw this place. I wouldn’t have blamed him. If only. 

I should mention something about the plasma we work with. It comes in bottles, sealed tight, packed in cardboard boxes. Each is labeled—donor name, lot number, inventory codes. Everything accounted for. Or it’s supposed to be. We’re not allowed to sample anything without checking the label first.

I remember Francis would sometimes tell me we were missing a few samples. He mentioned it more towards the end of his time at the lab. 

Now that he was gone, I was the one trying to hunt down our missing samples. It isn’t the end of the world and it is certainly explainable. Someone forgot to ship something, someone did ship something somewhere they weren’t supposed to, or maybe someone just lost them.

Usually, we notify our suppliers who either send us more or cancel the order. 

But it’s been so consistent recently. I suppose our resident ghost has been active. 

I joke, but it was getting a bit strange. Francis’s supposed supernatural encounters got worse too. I think it stopped being a joke to him. The guy got pretty freaked out. 

He used up all his sick time to stay away from work, and did all he could to only be in the lab if me or someone else was there too. I brought it up to him once and he explained it to me, but not in depth. 

Banging from the inside of the freezer. And voices. He had been hearing voices. I could tell by his tone that he wasn’t giving me the full story. 

But he seemed so genuinely afraid, I figured I didn’t want to push him to speak about something he was clearly uncomfortable with. 

That being said, I never heard the banging or the voices, or whatever else was clearly bothering him. No, what really started bothering me were the damned missing samples. It got to the point where almost every order was missing several bottles—sometimes whole boxes.

I would take stock of our samples the night before, lock them in the fridge, only for them to be missing the next day. And I would have no issue with this, I didn’t pay for the stuff. But when they went missing, I was the one stuck scavenging the lab—or worse, writing a report.

I brought it up to my manager but he always played it off. Made it seem like no big deal. Which it wasn’t, I suppose. But my manager has always been a stickler. He once had me spend 2 whole shifts triple checking inventory because the intern miscounted. He is not the type of person to just brush this off. 

Eventually, I decided to check the inventory myself. Box by box. Pallet by pallet. Including the ones in the freezer. Even the ones in the back.

I don’t like going into the freezer. We keep it very, very cold. So cold that when you walk in, it almost knocks the wind out of you. The white, condensed air is so thick you can only see a few feet in front of you. 
 
The freezer has just enough room for 8 pallets, stacked in 2 rows of 4 from front to back. And so, I latched the door behind me - the alarm goes off if you don’t - and started with pallet number one. 

The boxes are heavy, and I went through what felt like hundreds. My shoulders, arms, and back ached as I unpacked a pallet, searched every box, checked every bottle, only to restack it after not finding my samples. I didn’t sweat. It was far too cold for that. I had to take breaks in between pallets to go back outside and heat up.

Things didn’t get strange until pallet 4. Midway through I heard tapping - light, barely audible. Like someone was tapping on the outside of the freezer wall the same way you would a fish bowl. I paid it no mind - not even Francis’s ghost would stop me from finding those plasma bottles. I was not about to come in on Saturday to find them. 
On my next break, I wandered into the manager’s office. I kicked the frost from the latch and shoved the door open then headed down the hall to warm up.
He keeps everything on paper so I figured I’d check the shipment logs myself. Just to be sure we ever received the missing boxes at all.
At first, everything looked normal. Shipping dates. Lot numbers. Supplier names.
But a few pages in, I found a folder tucked between two binders with no label. Just red pen marks on the spine.
Inside were handwritten entries. Not in the usual format. Sample IDs I didn’t recognize.
Next to them, in neat little columns: “Rejected.” “Drained.” “Vessel.”
And beyond that, the notes became more like erratic drawings. Circular sketches. Veins drawn like constellations. And one that sticks in my head even now. It showed what looked like a throne of twisting, blood-filled tubes. Above it was a phrase written in red ink, in all caps:
“SANGUIS EX SOMNO.”
Blood from sleep. 
Another series of tapping jolted me back to reality. 
I closed the folder and stepped back, trying to shake off the unease creeping into my spine. The notes were weird, sure. The drawings were worse. But maybe it was just some kind of joke, or old training material, or hell—maybe the manager’s into occult nonsense. It didn’t mean anything. Probably.
Still, one of the sample IDs stuck in my head. I remembered it from earlier—half-covered in frost on the bottom row of pallet four. I hadn’t opened that box yet. And as much as I wanted to walk out, slam the office door, and pretend none of this happened… I needed to know.
If that box was missing too—fine. But if it was there?
Then maybe I'd finally get some answers.
I went back and finished restacking pallet 4, which did not yield me my prize. The condensation was thicker now, even the floor had frozen over like an ice skating rink. It was time for a break. Maybe even a cup of coffee to warm me. 

I shuffled my way to the exit latch and pulled with all my might, but it didn’t budge. Panic filled my stomach and throat. I yanked harder, desperately trying to get out, but it may as well have been a vault.

I banged on the door and yelled at the top of my lungs for my manager. But it was no use and I knew it. He told me he was going to make a delivery and wouldn’t be back for another hour or 2.

I tried to calm myself, panic wouldn’t help me. It’s likely something was caught on the sliding freezer door, keeping it stuck in place from the outside. 

But there must be another way out, another safety feature somewhere in here. I fumbled through the white fog, shivering, groping for the wall in front of me. I felt around as I shifted down the walls, like someone looking for a lightswitch in the dark. 

I got to the back wall and noticed the difference in texture immediately. It was smooth. And colder than the previous wall. Solid, transparent ice, like a one way mirror. I looked up from my hands to the wall and fell backwards in fear. 

Frozen inside was a corpse. Eyeless, shriveled like an old piece of beef jerky. Mouth agape in a silent scream. Its withered hand reached out to put its palm on the surface of the ice. 

I staggered to my feet and tried to collect myself. A frozen body wasn’t immediately dangerous to me, terrifying as it was. After a moment, it dawned on me just how familiar it looked. 

I leaned against the ice, trying to get a better look through the building condensation. The figure looked mummified. Hollow and ruined. But the face.

I knew that face.

My eyes dropped to the hand on the glass.
There was a ring on the finger. Simple. Cheap. Blue stone.

Francis’s ring.

My thoughts didn’t have time to race before I heard it.

Crack.

A sound like a dam breaking. 

A spiderweb of splinters and cracks formed on the wall that separated me and my once coworker. The epicenter of which I traced back to the corpse’s palm. 

Before I could process what was happening, before I could flee, Francis breached the ice, wrapped his arms around my shoulders, and pulled me through the ice.

I feel through darkness. Through nothingness, until I landed hard on my back on something plastic and pointed. It was like being dropped into an ocean made of broken toys.. 

I struggled to the top of this ocean only to see the impossible hellscape I had been abducted into. 

An ocean of bottles. Bottles of blood. Of plasma. Some sealed, some cracked open. All of them leaking that horrid, inescapable stench. That sickly-sweet, curdled smell that clung to my throat and eyes.

Above me, the sky was the same color as the yellow plasma I had grown so familiar with. Murky, sour, and thick with light that didn’t feel like light at all.

Every breath made me gag. Every movement I made put pressure on the bottles beneath me, which would in turn squirt its chunky, putrid contents onto me. As I crawled desperately, not an inch of me was spared.

As my brain struggled to process my new Hell, I noticed the only thing there was to notice. In this ocean of filth was a hill. A hill of the same bottles stood like a monument several meters away from me.

I made my way to it, an agonizing crawl of bodily fluids and sharp plastic. I vomited more than once on the way.

But, eventually, I did make it there. 

It wasn’t a hill, rather it was a perch. On it stood what looked like a mockery of an ornate throne. Blood clots for gems, and made almost entirely of veins, capillaries, and sinews. Just like my manager had drawn. 

On it, sat what once was Francis. The same posture, the same silent scream. His hollow eyes bore into me with an intensity that forced me to my knees. As if gravity had increased on my shoulders. 

New figures had emerged now. Maybe they’d been there the whole time, and I was too panicked to see. Maybe they’d risen from the ocean of filth around me. I couldn’t say.

I recognized many of them. They had traded their lab coats for hoods and robes. They stood in a half circle around the throne, all of their attention on me and the corpse. 
I don’t remember standing. I don’t remember walking. But I was face to face with it now.
Francis - or what he was now - watched me from the throne. But something else moved beneath his skin. A pulsing, writhing thing that stirred the veins like puppet strings. Its hollow mouth twitched. Opened.
And then I screamed.
Blood poured from my nose. My ears. My eyes. It welled up in my throat and spilled from my lips, thick and hot. The taste of metal overpowered even the stench of plasma. 
There was a sound that wasn’t a sound at all. A feeling rather? A vibration deep in my marrow, a wordless hunger. It was pulling me. My veins, my bones, my very cells. The corpse was going to drink me as if through a straw. 

Then a new sensation - cold. My palms were cold. 

My body knew what to do before my mind did. I pushed with all my might against nothing. Against the air, like miming the act of forcing open a sealed door.. 

I pushed with every ounce of my being, fighting for my life to escape my fate.

I successfully pushed myself off of the ice wall. I stumbled backwards into a pallet and looked up - still face to face with the corpse. 

A deafening howl came from its mouth. Its outstretched, withered arm banged on the ice in a furious rage. 

I ran to the door, slipping on frost as I went but never falling. 

The freezer door was ahead, fogged and rimmed with frost.

The latch was still jammed, but I didn’t care. I threw my weight into it again and again, shoulder first, shouting until my throat tore.

Something gave.

A crack. A hiss. The seal broke.

I feel forward into the lab, shivering and pale. I stood and immediately slammed the door shut, latching it behind me once again.

I kept running until I reached my car. I never knew my car could reach that speed - I must've halved the time it takes to normally get home. 

Even there, I didn't stay long. I packed up everything I thought I may need and took off again, this time to the airport.

That brings me to now - typing this on my laptop during a flight. I’m not going to tell you where to.

I have no idea how far this goes. How deep those people have infiltrated my field. And I don’t plan on risking it again.

I’m staying as far away as I can from anything even remotely related to bloodwork. And I plan to do so far, far away from that place.

That being said - I plan to update again, 

for my own safety.

If I don’t post within a few days, please check the freezer.",2,1751073198.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1lmah9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_United-Lecture3928/comments/1lmah9m/ummm_yall_were_right_about_this_whole_beans_shit/,Ummm y’all were right about this whole beans shit????,"Have a good old Casabrews Ultra and been buying some random costco ground blend since like forever (it's the one my mom used, my sister used…you get the picture). And wow I’ve been drinking piss this entire time and no one told me. 

Whole beans are just so much better. Yeah, sure you have to grind them first and all that, but honestly a grinder’s like 25 bucks on Amazon (didn’t pitch for an expensive one, since even the coffeemaker’s cheapish). Gamechanger. 

The thing is I’ve tried a couple of random small bags (you guessed it, they’re from costco) and I’m already noticing the difference. But now I wanna get serious about this stuff. Did a little Reddit deep dive before this and came up with [Caffe Borbone](https://videoguidelines.com/dp-B0CCVRNF2J). Here to provide a little context and ask for more reccs. 

Reasons I wanna try Caffe Borbone: 

1. It has some floral notes (Arabica beans) and I’m so curious cos I’ve tried fruity and they’ve been a little bit citrusy so wanna taste the difference. From what I’ve tried in coffee shops, I think floral notes might be more to my taste. 
2. Medium Roast. This I know for sure that I’m only into medium roast coffee, light roast espressos taste like water to me and dark ones are like tar. 
3. Italian. Leaning towards Italian coffees, they seem to have good reviews online and on r/coffee especially for beginners. 
4. Cheap. I know its another mass produced bag, but that makes it cheaper and that’s unfortunately something I have to keep in mind for now. And for the price, I think it's a pretty good deal, considering its not from a big chain that’s selling me idek what in the name of coffee. Been hearing good things about Illy and Lavazza too btw. 

Reasons I haven’t tried Caffe Borbone yet: 

1. I’m fully broke. I wanna invest in a good 2 pound bag to last me a while and it’s not feasible to go around trying $50 bags to see whether I like it or not, so I’m here to gain some more reccs before I settle on one. 

And PLEASE no one recc anything from local roasters, trust me there are none in my area, I’m in the backend of nowhere so Amazon is really the only option and keep the reccs affordable please. ",1,1751073115.0,u_United-Lecture3928,0,1.0,False
