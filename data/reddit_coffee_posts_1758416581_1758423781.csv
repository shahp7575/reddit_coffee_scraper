1nmh0hp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1nmh0hp/sycamore_row_john_grisham_jake_brigance_series/,Sycamore Row ‚Äì John Grisham (Jake Brigance Series Book 2),"Hello everyone,

I've just finished diving into [Sycamore Row ‚Äì John Grisham (Jake Brigance Series Book 2)](https://pdfhive.com/sycamore-row-john-grisham/), and I wanted to share my honest thoughts with you, almost like we're just chatting over coffee. If you're a fan of legal dramas or just a good story with plenty of twists, you're in for a treat with this one.

**A Quick Look (No Spoilers, I Promise!)**

""Sycamore Row"" picks up a few years after the first Jake Brigance book, ""A Time to Kill,"" but you don't necessarily need to have read the first to enjoy this one. The story kicks off in 1988 in the fictional town of Clanton, Mississippi, when a wealthy, ailing old man decides to shock everyone by leaving his massive fortune not to his estranged children, but to his Black housekeeper. Naturally, this ignites a fierce legal battle, bringing racial tensions simmering beneath the surface to a full boil. Our familiar lawyer, Jake Brigance, finds himself once again caught in the middle, trying to honor the deceased's last wishes against a tide of public opinion and legal challenges.

**What Really Stood Out For Me**

*   **The Story's Heart:** What I truly appreciated was how Grisham delves into complex themes like race, justice, and the deep-seated prejudices that can linger in a community. It‚Äôs not just a legal thriller; it‚Äôs a peek into the human condition, making you think long after you've closed the book.
*   **Jake Brigance:** Jake is such a relatable character. He's not some superhero lawyer; he's flawed, tired, and often overwhelmed, but he possesses a strong moral compass. You really root for him as he tries to navigate the ethical minefield this case presents.
*   **Pacing and Detail:** Grisham is a master at setting a scene. The courtroom drama felt incredibly authentic, almost as if I was sitting in the jury box myself. The pacing is deliberate, building suspense with each legal maneuver and testimony. If you enjoy detailed procedural drama, this is definitely for you.

**A Few Things to Keep in Mind**

While I thoroughly enjoyed ""Sycamore Row,"" I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a couple of points. Because it's a legal thriller, there are moments of detailed legal discussion that might slow down the pace for some readers. It's not a fast-paced action book, but rather a slow burn that builds to a powerful climax. If you're looking for something that moves at breakneck speed, you might find certain sections require a bit more patience. However, this attention to detail is what makes the story so rich.

**Would I Recommend It? And For Whom?**

Absolutely, yes! I would highly recommend [Sycamore Row ‚Äì John Grisham (Jake Brigance Series Book 2)](https://pdfhive.com/sycamore-row-john-grisham/) to anyone who loves a good legal thriller, particularly those who appreciate stories that tackle significant social issues. If you're a fan of John Grisham's other works, or if you enjoy authors like Scott Turow, you will likely find this to be a compelling read. It‚Äôs also excellent for casual readers who enjoy a well-crafted mystery with depth.

**A Little Note for New Readers**

If you're new to longer books or legal thrillers, here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Take Your Time:** There's no rush to finish. Read at your own pace.
2.  **Break It Down:** If a chapter feels long, just aim to read a few pages or a specific section. Small victories add up!
3.  **Don't Be Afraid to Look Up Things:** If legal terms or historical context confuse you, a quick search can often clarify things and deepen your understanding.
4.  **Find Your Spot:** A comfy chair, good lighting, maybe a cup of tea. Make reading a pleasant experience.
5.  **It‚Äôs Okay to Put It Down:** If you're not enjoying a book after a fair shot, it's perfectly fine to set it aside. Not every book is for every person, and that's okay. But for a story like this one, I'd encourage you to stick with it ‚Äì the payoff is worth it!

Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore. ""Sycamore Row"" offers a robust story that makes you think, and I hope you consider giving it a try.

1nmgw9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1nmgw9k/f4aplayingm_romance_ideas/,(F4AplayingM) Romance ideas,"
Hello Reddit! Do you love romance ideas?Slow-burn romances? Hurt and comfort romances? Ohh, maybe a pregnancy romance idea? Well, I have ideas for all those categories! I'm not replacing any of my current partners or anything. I'm just posting the ideas floating around my head. Anyway, let's get to the important stuff! My name is Em, and I am a 22-year-old woman. I have been roleplaying for a long time. Like a very long time. I consider myself a novella-length writer. Which means I write around 500-2,000 words per post. I prefer to roleplay on Discord. I write exclusively in third person. I am an adult, so I will require that you are at least 22. I love chatting about our characters and sending TikToks or other stuff. Ohh, also the important part. I do enjoy smut, but I do a ratio of 80 percent story to 20 percent smut. That is not negotiable; I write for the joy of crafting a story, not to get off.



So to recap, here is what I'm looking for in a partner. Someone who is at least 22 years old. Someone who can match my length and writes exclusively in third person like I do. Someone who understands that these roles are not all smut. Someone who enjoys chatting and building friendships with their partners!Also, I understand you get busy, as I'm a college student and work full time, so if you are busy, just let me know! 

Also please use the password: Romance awaits. 



On to the roles! Now, I broke them up into categories to make it easier to understand. 
MMC is the male main character. 
FMC is the female main character. 




Pregnancy Plots:

1. The MMC is looking for a surrogate to help him start his family. Maybe his wife has passed, or maybe he is just tired of waiting for the one to come along. So he finds FCM through a surrogate agency and begins the journey to give him a family and much, much more.



2. MMC and FMC were a fling in college, and then they had a messy breakup. So she figured he wouldn't want anything to do with his special needs daughter. That is until they run into each other in a store years later. 



3. MMC and FMC work together. They actually despise each other. So much so that everyone in the office knows that. MMC pulls pranks on FMC just to piss her off. That is until FMC life falls apart. She was married, but then she found out her husband was cheating on her weeks after finding out she was pregnant. Her life falls apart. Little did she know the man she hated would be the one to help her put her life back together. 



Slow Burn plots:

1. FMC is a journalist, a reporter for a huge newspaper company. MMC is the famous person she is tasked with trying to get to agree to an interview. Fate has other plans, and the two end up in a love story fit for the times.  All the drama MMC has in the press is fabricated by FMC to save him. 



2. FMC is a world-class bull rider. When she is paralyzed in an accident. Her family hires FMC to help bring her out of her shell. The only problem is FMC hates MMC, but that slowly ebbs away. 



3. FCM is the queen of Scotland. The only child of the king and queen, she becomes queen after her mother's death. She is amazing at it, but to keep the country afloat, she must find a king. Her father arranges for her to marry the king of another country. Maybe Russia or England or something. FCM hates MMC with a passion. She wants to run the country because MMC cannot do it. So she spends her time planning to kill him. Unaware that MMC wants nothing to do with being king and would much rather study his hobbies. 



Hurt/comfort plots: 

1. MMC and FMC were best friends. They were inseparable until FMC was in a car accident after leaving MMC's party. He thinks he caused the accident, so he no longer speaks to her. That is until one day when he comes across her YouTube page that talks about her life and her love for him. 



2. FMC is homeless and injured, living in New York. She is barely surviving if she is being honest. Sure, she spends most of her money on drugs, but that's only because her leg doesn't hurt when she is high. One day she is trying to get a hot chocolate from a coffee shop while people grumble behind her. When it's not enough money, she just leaves. MMC watches the whole thing play out and decides he must help her. After all, he definitely has enough money to do so.



3. FMC has cystic fibrosis; she has made peace with dying. That is until she meets MMC, a vampire who now works at her job. He can't understand why she won't let him fix her. She can't understand why he cares enough to want to fix her. A beautiful love story is born. 



Enemies-to-lovers plots:


1 This one is truly an enemies-to-lovers idea. MMC is an awful person, a racist, a bigot, you name it. They are just awful.That is until they meet FMC, a woman who is everything they hate, but she isn't afraid to call him out on his wrongs. To change his mind. It's slow, it's ugly, and it's beautiful.



2. MMC and FMC families have hated each other for years. They don't really know why or understand it. Waking up one morning from a one-night stand, FMC is shocked to find MMC beside her. She vaguely remembers the night. The guy was smart, funny, and interested in her. Though she still hates him. This starts a very weird friendship with benefits that turns to more. 



3. FMC is a brutal serial killer. MMC is a cop tasked with getting FMC to help them catch a copycat killer. The two can barely stand each other, though in the hatred something else blooms.


4. FCM is a siren.  Her entire existence is to lure men to their deaths.  MMC is a hunter of supernatural. The entire time he has been looking for his friend.  Only to find she is the very thing he is hunting. 



Sample of my writing: 

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes‚Äîfive minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.

The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left.

Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact Adrain and slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.

Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.

That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrain was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.

It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.

That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world.  
""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.

Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.

The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.

PREGNANT.

In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.

All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow.  
With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.

Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed. She smiled at the memory of Jim reading bedtime stories in an empty room as Paige hid under the bed. He would end everyone with, ""Papa, loves you; it's okay. You are safe."" She needed that now more than ever.

One year ago I had my dream life. I was making $140k a year while working remotely 20 hrs a week, married to the love of my life, and travelling the world. Then suddenly I was let go from my job because of industry changes. As a contractor I wasn‚Äôt eligible for EI or severance.

Shortly after, I found out I‚Äôm pregnant with my 3rd baby. I was excited but scared since I‚Äôm now making $40k a year, and as a contractor, I‚Äôm not eligible for maternity leave. My husband assured me we would be ok and he would take care of us. But then he lost his job too!! 

We lost our insurance benefits from his work, he had to stop taking very important meds, and I had to stop going to much needed therapy. This led to both of us going a little crazy and some very toxic moments. We‚Äôre now taking a break from our relationship indefinitely. 

Our baby will be here soon and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do. I‚Äôm barely scraping by. I don‚Äôt have enough for my basic necessities and there‚Äôs nothing left over to even get a coffee or go out to eat with friends. How the f am I going to afford another baby!! And how am I going to work at the same time??? Luckily I work remotely but my work is very focused and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to do it.

What should I do?? Please don‚Äôt suggest adoption. I love this baby girl so much already, I‚Äôll never let her go. ",2,1758423089.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False

My best friend Monica was on top of my husband. Her dark hair spilled over her bare shoulders as she scrambled to cover herself, her eyes wide with shock.
Richard lay beneath her, his face flushed, his hands still gripping her waist like he could not let go.
Our bed. The Egyptian cotton sheets I had bought for our anniversary.
My heart was broken and I could not breathe.
""Claire!"" Monica's voice cracked as she grabbed for the sheet. ""Oh my God, Claire!""
Richard's eyes met mine across the room.
""How long have you been standing there?"" His voice was cold, almost annoyed like I was the one interrupting something I should not have.
""Are you saying I'm disturbing you?"" My tone was sharp as I stared at them.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
CLAIRE‚ÄôS POV
I should have known something was wrong when I came home to silence.
Richard's car was in the driveway next to Monica's little red BMW, but the house felt empty. Too quiet.
""Richard?"" I called out, setting my purse on the marble table by the front door. ""Monica?""
My best friend had texted me an hour ago, saying she had stopped by to drop off the wedding photos from her cousin's ceremony last weekend.
Monica was always doing thoughtful things like that, bringing over fresh cookies, helping me pick out new curtains, and making sure I never felt lonely when Richard worked late.
Which was most nights lately.
I kicked off my heels and padded through the corridor in my stockings. The living room was empty, but I could hear something from upstairs.
A soft thudding sound, rhythmic and steady.
The sounds were coming from our bedroom.
My stomach twisted with an uneasiness I could not name. Something felt wrong, but I could not put my finger on what.
The air itself seemed heavy, charged with a tension that made my skin tickle.
I paused outside our bedroom door, my hand pausing over the handle. The sounds were clearer now, a rhythmic creaking, soft gasps, and something else.
Something that made my heart start racing for all the wrong reasons.
""Richard?"" I called again, my voice smaller this time.
The sounds stopped.
For a moment, there was complete silence. Then I heard Monica's voice, breathless and panicked: ""Oh God, someone's here.""
My hand shook as I pushed the door open.
And my world shattered into a million pieces.
Monica was on top of my husband. Her dark hair spilled over her bare shoulders as she scrambled to cover herself, her eyes wide with shock.
Richard lay beneath her, his face flushed, his hands still gripping her waist like he could not let go.
Our bed. The Egyptian cotton sheets I had bought for our anniversary. The throw pillows I had embroidered with little hearts during those lonely evenings when Richard worked late.
I could not breathe.
I could not move.
I could not think.
This was not real. This could not be real. Monica was my best friend. She was the one who helped me plan our anniversary dinner just last month.
She was the one who listened to me worry about Richard working too much, and who guaranteed me that all successful men went through phases like this.
She was the one who told me I was lucky to have such a devoted husband.
""Claire!"" Monica's voice cracked as she grabbed for the sheet. ""Oh my God, Claire!""
Richard's eyes met mine across the room. For just a second, I saw a flash of something‚Ä¶guilt, maybe, or regret. But then his face went hard, like a door slamming shut.
""How long have you been standing there?"" His voice was cold, almost annoyed like I was the one interrupting something I should not have.
How long? The question echoed in my head, but I could not make sense of it. How long had I been watching my life fall apart? How long had I been staring at the two people I trusted most in the world betraying me in the most intimate way possible?
""I... I just got home,"" I whispered. My voice sounded strange like it was coming from underwater. ""I called for you.""
Monica was crying now, hugging the sheet to her chest. ""Claire, please, you have to understand. We did not mean for this to happen. It just... it just happened.""
It just happened. Like they had accidentally fallen into bed together. Like clothes removed themselves and bodies just found each other without any choice or decision or betrayal involved.
The room started spinning. The walls seemed to stagger and sway like I was on a boat in rough water. My vision blurred at the edge, and a strange ringing filled my ears.
""Claire?"" Monica's voice sounded far away now. ""Claire, are you okay?""
I looked at Richard again. My husband. The man who had promised to love and cherish me until death do us part.
He was sitting up now, not bothering to cover himself, his blue eyes‚Ä¶.the eyes I had once thought were the most beautiful thing in the world‚Ä¶looking at me like I was a stranger.
Like I was an inconvenience.
""Richard,"" I breathed his name like a prayer.
But he did not answer.
-
In hospital, Richard wore an expensive suit and a face that belonged in a boardroom, not a hospital room where his wife was there.
But now is not the time to think about these.
""Richard."" I reached for his hand, but he pulled it away before I could touch him. ""We need to talk about what happened. About Monica. About us.""
Something flashed across his face, but it was gone so fast I might have imagined it.
""You're right,"" he said. ""We do need to talk.""
Relief flooded through me. Thank God. He wanted to work this out. We could get through this. Marriages survived infidelity all the time.
We could go to counseling, we could‚Ä¶.
Richard pulled an envelope from his jacket and set it on the bedside table.
My heart stopped.
""What is that?"" I whispered, even though some part of me already knew. Some part of me had been preparing for this moment since I saw the coldness in his eyes yesterday.
""Divorce papers."" His voice was steady, businesslike. ""My lawyer had them drawn up this morning.""
The words hit me like a physical blow. I flinched, my hand flying to my chest where it felt like something was tearing apart.
""Divorce papers,"" I repeated because surely I had misheard.
Surely my husband of three years was not sitting in my hospital room, while I was recovering from emergency surgery, handing me divorce papers.
""I want this done quickly and quietly,"" he continued like he was discussing a merger or a stock trade. ""No messy custody battles, no drawn-out proceedings. Clean and simple.""
I stared at him, searching his face for any trace of the man I had married. The man who used to bring me coffee in bed every Sunday morning.
The man who used to dance with me in the kitchen while dinner was cooked. The man who used to tell me I was the most beautiful woman in the world.
""Richard,"" My voice broke on his name. ""Is it because of Monica?‚Äù
He was silent for a while before he spoke, ""Monica is everything you're not,"" he continued, his voice never changing, never showing any emotion at all. ""She's independent. She has her own career, her own friends, and her own interests. She does not need me to validate her existence.""
Monica. My best friend. The woman who had held me while I cried about feeling disconnected from my husband.
The woman who had told me that Richard was just going through a stressful period at work. The woman who had encouraged me to be more understanding, more patient, more helpful.
Had she been planning this all along? Had every conversation we had about my marriage been her gathering information, figuring out exactly how to steal my husband away from me?
""How long?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.
""What?""
""How long have you been sleeping with her?""
Richard's jaw tightened. For the first time since he had walked into this room, he looked uncomfortable.
""That's not important.""
""It is to me."" I tried to sit up straighter, ignoring the pain in my side. ""How long have you been lying to me? How long have you been coming home to me after being with her?""
""Six months.""
Six months. Half a year of betrayal. Half a year of lies. Half a year of him smooching me goodnight with the same mouth he had been using to smooch her.
""Sign the papers,"" he said, his tone final. ""The settlement is generous. More than generous. You'll be able to buy a nice condo somewhere, start over.""
Start over. Like three years of marriage could just be erased. Like the life we had built together was nothing more than a rough draft that could be crumpled up and thrown away.
""What if I don't sign?"" I asked, even though I already knew the answer.
""Then I will challenge it. I will drag this through the courts for years. I will make sure everyone knows exactly why our marriage failed."" His blue eyes‚Ä¶the eyes I had once thought were the most beautiful thing in the world‚Ä¶.went ice cold.
I looked down at my left hand, at the wedding ring that had lived there for three years. The ring Richard had slipped onto my finger while he promised to love and cherish me until death do us part.
I twisted it off my finger and held it out to him.
""Take it,"" I whispered.
He stared at the ring for a long moment, and for just a second, I thought I saw something crack in his carefully controlled face.
But then he took the ring and slipped it into his pocket without a word.
I picked up the pen the lawyer had left with the papers.
My hand trembled as I brought it to the signature line. Claire Blackwood, I started to write, then stopped.
That was not my name anymore, was it? I was not Mrs. Richard Blackwood. I was just Claire. Claire nobody. Claire with no identity except the one I had lost when I had given up everything to be his wife.
I set the pen down and closed my eyes.
Somewhere in this hospital, there were other women recovering from surgery. Women with husbands who held their hands and brought them flowers and whispered words of love and comfort.
Women whose marriages were real, whose love was valued, whose hearts were not being ripped out of their chests by the very person who was supposed to protect them.
But I was not one of those women.
I was Claire, the woman who was not enough. The woman who loved too much. The woman who was so pathetic and clingy that her husband could not wait to escape her.
I opened my eyes and picked up the pen again.
This time, I signed.
""Good,"" he said, gathering up the papers. ""That makes this easier.""
""Makes what easier?""
Richard sat down in the chair again, but this time he leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, his blue eyes fixed on my face with an intensity that made my skin crawl.
""Monica's pregnant. And we are getting married,"" he smiled, ""As soon as the divorce is final.""
Pregnant. Married.
The words hit me like a cargo train. Monica was pregnant with Richard's baby. The baby I had been hoping for, praying for, dreaming about for three years.
""How long?"" I whispered.
""Two months."" Richard's voice was steady, matter-of-fact. ""We're telling people after the wedding.""
Two months.
She had been pregnant when she helped me plan our anniversary dinner. She had been carrying Richard's child when she sat in my living room and listened to me worry about our marriage.
She had been growing his baby inside her while she comforted me and told me everything would be okay.
""Claire?"" Richard's voice seemed to come from very far away. ""Are you all right?""
All right? Was I all right?
My husband had just told me I disgusted him. He had told me our entire marriage was a lie. He had told me he had been sickened by my touch for months.
And now he was telling me that my best friend was pregnant with his child.
Was I all right?
I started to laugh.
It came out as a broken, hysterical sound that did not seem to belong to me. I laughed until tears streamed down my face, until I could not breathe.
""Claire."" Richard stepped back into the room, and for the first time since this conversation started, he looked worried. ""Claire, stop. You're scaring me.""
Scaring him? That was rich. He had just finished telling me I was the most pathetic, disgusting, suffocating woman alive, and now he was scared because I was laughing?
""I'm sorry,"" I gasped between fits of laughter. ""I'm just trying to figure out how I'm supposed to thank you for this favor you're doing me.""
""Claire‚Ä¶‚Äù
""No, really,"" I continued, my laughter taking on an edge that made even me nervous. ""You've given me such a gift. You've shown me exactly how pathetic I am. How worthless. How completely unlovable.""
""That's not what I‚Ä¶‚Äù
""Isn't it?"" I wiped the tears from my cheeks with the back of my hand.
""You've made it very clear, Richard. I'm disgusting. I'm suffocating. I'm so nauseous that my own husband couldn't stand to touch me. And my best friend? She's carrying your baby while I'm lying here like the pathetic fool I am.""
The laughter died in my throat, replaced by something harder. Something colder.
""But you know what the funny thing is?"" I looked directly into his eyes, and for the first time in this entire conversation, he was the one who looked away first.
""Someday you're going to realize what you threw away. Someday you're going to miss having someone who loved you unconditionally.""
""Claire‚Ä¶‚Äù
""Get out."" The words came out quiet but firm. ""Get out of my room. Get out of my life. And Richard?""
He turned back to look at me.
""Don't ever come back.""
The door closed behind him with a soft click, and I was alone.
Alone with the machines beeping around me. Alone with the divorce papers that made our separation official. Alone with the knowledge that the man I had loved more than life itself thought I was disgusting.
But as I lay there in that sterile hospital room, something began to change inside me. The heartbreak was still there, raw and agonizing. But underneath it, something else was growing.
Anger.
Not the hot, explosive kind that burns out quickly. This was something cooler, more dangerous. This was the kind of anger that was planned. That waits. That remembers every cruel word and files it away for later use.
Richard thought I was pathetic? He thought I was weak?
He was about to find out just how wrong he was.",1,1758423083.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Since then when have changed store managers twice and got our old lead manager(2nd in charge) back. J our new SM is a great guy and K (2nd) has always been amazing and I was thrilled she came back.  After the last SM left I have been  voicing that I would like to be a supervisor again now that things have settled at home. 
  I know just because I want a position doesn't mean I get it so I've been making sure to help how ever I can and go above and beyond in what ever I could i.e helping teach new hires, helping the new SM with issues any issues he had, calling the help desk for issues, food/coffee runs, starting and running the stores social media(per SM's request) truck team, markdown team, party planing/potluck planning etc. Never an issue, never told anything was wrong, always praised on being a great employee.  2 months ago my older brother passed away and I was crushed, I took my  3 bereavement days and 4 days I already had off before coming back.  About a month or so ago they rehired a girl we'll call V.  I didnt have have a problem with V and we generally picked on each other like sisters or hit on each other( nothing to crazy or uncomfortable) but when she left we were both sups. And had an argument, we made up 10 mins later but she walked out and quit.  I was excited she was coming back and we laughed about the whole ordeal like it was so stupid.  
  2 weeks after V came back a new girl, T, told me that she and V were going to be sups, I went told K and asked her if the was true and she said yes but they were seeing if they could and another supervisor position and then the would add me too.  I left the office but that stung a little but I let it go and went on.  Last week I pulled into work not really feeling it but still trying V told me I looked like a BA and I said thanks still in my car, then she turned to K and told her she didn't recognize me and thought they were gonna be robbed.  It felt high schoolish, but I tried to brush it off and went in.  Greeted T like ""heyyy boss lady"" and went to put up my lunch, side note it was a day we had truck and we have potluck those days but I hadn't heard anything about it.  T came in as I was locking my locker and asked what we were doing for potluck, I nonchalantly replied ""fuck if I know I just brought my lunch"" (not an uncommon response for me in employee only areas) and I walked out of the break room.  While waiting for the truck J gave everyone tasks and turned to T and V and told them they were the managers on duty, it reminded me that I had been looked over for the position and it hurt so I figured since I was not really cheery I would just keep to myself and just do my tasks.  Truck shows up we unload and start getting it unboxed and out on the floor, some of the boxes are long so I asked V if she could turn hers so I could put the last of this set on the table and it had a quick exchange:
Me: hey V can you turn your box so this one will fit?
V: sure you happy now
Me: nope never happy
V: yeah I can tell your miserable 
Me: yup that's me miserable b*tch
I assumed it was our usual banter put the box on the table and went to go to the bathroom.  While I was waited K came and told me she was feeling some hostility between me and V and didn't want any issues so we needed to come to the office. We sit down V says she has no issues, I relay the box thing and that we weren't serious and V says if someone give attitude she's giving it back. I was confused I said I hardly spoke to anyone today what did I do, V said she wasn't the only one who thought so and did I want to get the other person, I said sure.  She came back with T who said the exchange in the breaktoom was filled with attitude why would I say that to her.  Again I'm confused I didn't snap at her and like I said that's a pretty common response from me in areas with no customers. I continue to tell all 3 to just leave me be and I am fine but now it's 3 against 1 talking over me interrupting, not letting me talk and rapid fire ""what's wrong, somethings wrong, why are you upset, why do you have an attitude?"" I snapped, I slammed my hand on the desk and shouted pointing at K "" you want to know what's wrong you and J kept telling me when a position came up you would get me in and you skipped over me twice!"" 
  T and V asked like 5 times that it wasn't them i said no, so they walked out and told J to come in where I told him the same thing; for months I had been hyped up to believe that I would be a supervisor and had been taking on extra to show I  still could, that they had lied to me and while I know it's a business but that hurt to constantly be told how great i was and everything but not good enough. K was focused mostly on the fact that i called her a liar, J started telling me that here lately i had been giving 110% like I used to and that it was the little things such as i left my drink on the back counter twice, I sometimes forgot my walkie talkie, every time there's an issue I have to come up with a better solution, I've been on my phone on the floor.  Now to be fair the walkie talkie is considered part of our uniform when we are clocked in, and the drink I had been told that's no lie and my fault, the phone was making content for the 5 socials I had made like he asked, and if you ask me for ideas I give them not trying to one up anyone.  I chose not to remind them that I was still working through my brothers passing because they were going on about how I was good enough and they did care about me and they discussed it for days before choosing T and V.  That V didnt even was the position.  That hurt even more. I did point out that in those 2 months they never gave me any criticism on my work only praise and they said they should have communicated with me better.  I told them the damage was done and couldn't be undone I would be putting in my notice when I found a new job.  J then told me "" we'll now the management team isn't complete"" it is, all the spots have been filled.  I started to feel trapped and I just wanted out of the office so I just nodded said yep sure were all good let's go back to work, K hugged me and told me I wasn't going anywhere and to stop looking for a new job, V and T came back we all said we are good and went out.  One of the other associates told me when V and T came out the first time the didnt go back to work but off to the side to whisper and giggle like high school mean girls.

Standing in the middle of my bedroom, I bend forward, letting my long, dark hair hang down, down, down‚Äîalmost touching the ground. I grab it with both hands, and with the help of years of practice, I swoop it up into an effortless, messy bun and slide the hair tie off my wrist to secure it to the top of my head.

I stand straight and look at the mirror hanging on my wall to see my dimly lit reflection staring back at me. My hair is dirty and tangled, but I don‚Äôt worry about it‚Äîno one knows but me. My skin feels oily, but I‚Äôm tired of caring for my everyday needs right now.

Ignoring myself, I walk out of the room, through the hallway, and into the kitchen with a rhythmic march. I walk to the stove and turn it on with purpose, as if it was something I‚Äôd thought about before doing it. I decide this means I‚Äôm making tea, so I pull the nearby, half-full kettle over to the reddening burner and go to the pantry to get a tea bag.

I approach the tea cabinet and pull open the top drawer. I scan the contents, but nothing catches my attention. I push the drawer closed with discontent and open the one below it. The first thing I notice is the box of green tea pouches. I pull one out as if it‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôd been looking for.

Then, with the same purposeful, brisk walk, I leave the pantry, march through the kitchen, the hallway, and into my bedroom. I snatch the mug I drained of my morning coffee hours earlier from my desk. I bring the two items‚Äîtea bag and mug‚Äîback to the kitchen and set them next to the stove, where the kettle still sits and the water inside is still smooth and unbothered by the heat underneath.

I lean back on the kitchen island behind me and stare at the stubborn kettle with impatience. I don‚Äôt necessarily want tea, and I‚Äôm not in a hurry for anything or anyone, but I want to want something‚Äîso I decide that wanting a big, steaming cup of bland green tea will have to be enough.

I sigh. Why is wanting so exhausting?

I wish I could just be satisfied with not wanting‚Äîsatisfied with satisfaction. But I know nothing is that simple.

And yet, here I am, executing my daily tasks in my daily schedule. Not happy, but not unhappy. I just want out of the simple‚Äînot for life to slow down or speed up, just for it to feel less monitored. And making tea in the middle of the day, after months of not drinking tea, seemed like success enough.

I give an unexpected grin to the tea kettle as it begins to whisper to me. It has no idea what I‚Äôm thinking‚Äîjust like the people around me, who are alive and animate but still don‚Äôt know. Even I, who think my own thoughts, haven‚Äôt got a clue what any of it means. It‚Äôs like I exist on an entirely different philosophical wavelength than I can even interpret myself.

I continue to stare at the kettle as I begin to notice a stinging sensation‚Äîone singular strand of hair pulling too tightly against my scalp in the tangle of knots I‚Äôve called a bun. With complete disassociation, I fold my body over again and pull the tie from my hair‚Äîjust as the kettle starts to screech at me.

But I don‚Äôt care.

I continue the familiar motion of smoothing out my hair and redoing it all over again.

Bahrain‚Äôs 2025 Business Environment: Economic Growth, New Incentives, and Regulatory Updates\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain business towers with professionals walking outside.). Forbes Business ranked Bahrain among the world‚Äôs top five destinations for foreign SME investment, crediting business process simplification and near-unmatched 100% foreign ownership (Forbes business analysis).\
Importantly, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism (MOICT) announced that, effective March 2025, a single-window Sijilat update slashed CR waiting times by 55%. That‚Äôs not marketing fluff. This policy change directly cut our team‚Äôs average license turnaround from 14 to just 5 business days‚Äîa fact validated by recent Gulfnews reports on regional reforms.\
Bahrain‚Äôs strategic location between Saudi Arabia and the UAE remains a powerful draw. However, its distinct regulatory agility‚Äîflexible business structures, real 100% foreign ownership options, and investor-friendly free zones (ownership guide, free zones details)‚Äîputs it ahead of its neighbors in speed, simplicity, and value.\
The Numbers That Matter: Business Formation in 2025\
\
Foreign-owned enterprises: Up 21% since 2023.\
Sijilat platform adoption: 87% of all new CRs processed online.\
Average total setup cost for SMEs: BHD 250-800 (standard LLC or SPC).\

What Is Commercial Registration (CR) and Why Does It Matter?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration: Bahrain entrepreneurs at a professional meeting. step.\
\
‚ÄúNo CR, no business. Simple as that. Yet, getting the CR right the first time saves months of untangling compliance knots.‚Äù\
(Personal tip: Always double-check your business activity codes on Sijilat‚Äîincorrect classification costs time and money later.)\
\
Bahrain Company Formation: Structure Choices that Affect Your CR Fees\
Your business structure‚ÄîLLC, SPC, partnership, or branch‚Äîsets your CR cost and compliance obligations. Deep dive into entity types and structures for context.\
\
LLC (With Limited Liability): Most popular for SMEs. Minimum two shareholders.\
SPC (Single Person Company): For solo founders and consultants.\
Branch Office: Foreign businesses seeking Bahrain presence.\
WLL/Partnerships: Niche uses; usual for family or local partnerships.\
\
Key point: More complex structures (e.g., holding companies) mean higher fees, longer registration, and extra documentation. For 99% of foreign founders, a straightforward LLC or SPC is optimal.\

- Memorandum & Articles of Association\

- Activity details (precise Sijilat codes; check twice!)**\
Step 2: Submit via Sijilat‚ÄîSmart Timing\
\
Avoid: 11:00 am‚Äî2:00 pm (queues swamp the system, especially mid-week and during Ramadan).\
Best: 8:00‚Äì8:45 am or 3:30‚Äì4:30 pm (faster government responses).\
Pro hack: Use Bahrain Bay‚Äôs Sijilat service desk for English-speaking help‚Äîless crowded than Seef or Isa Town.\
\
Step 3: Pay Fees Swiftly and Get Receipts\
Pay all government CR fees via Sijilat or at the designated MOICT window in Seef, Diplomatic Area, or online. Never hand cash to ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù outside‚Äîthe only exceptions are licensed company formation agents (recommended provider), who will issue official receipts.\
Step 4: Municipality and Chamber Approvals\
If your business requires a Municipality License (retail, F&B, warehouse), file this in parallel to your CR, not after. Many overlook this, causing multi-week delays (I learned this the hard way‚Äîdon‚Äôt repeat my mistake).\
Step 5: Collect and Verify Your CR\
Once approvals land, download your digital Commercial Registration certificate‚Äîprint multiple copies, and create a folder for renewals and amendments (CR process guide). Bring paper copies to banks and regulatory meetings; electronic documents speed up verification.\
Personal aside: My first banking appointment in Seef ground to a halt because I hadn‚Äôt printed the Arabic CR. Now, I keep both English and Arabic versions on my phone and in my bag.\

Best approach: Use a free zone for unrestricted ownership and cost savings on certain taxes. For regulated sectors (e.g., insurance, banking), consult with the EDB or a trusted company formation expert.\
Compliance, Accounting, and Post-Formation Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation: Legal professional preparing regulatory documents in an office.\
\
CR Renewal Fee: BHD 80‚Äì400 (activity-dependent)\
Chamber of Commerce Renewal: BHD 20‚Äì60\
Accounting/Bookkeeping: From BHD 200/year (outsourcing saves time)\
VAT Registration (if BHD 37,500+ turnover): No charge for registration, but quarterly filings are mandatory.\
\
Ramadan business hours: Most government offices shift to 8:00 am ‚Äì 1:00 pm‚Äîplan filings accordingly. And always accept invitations to majlis coffee if offered; local business etiquette is unique, and these small rituals go a long way in smoothing regulatory hurdles.\
Compliance Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\
A common misstep: missing the annual CR renewal window. The MOICT sends an SMS reminder, but system hiccups sometimes mean you‚Äôll only see the notice in your Sijilat dashboard. I now use a dual reminder system: Google Calendar and a local business WhatsApp group.\
\
‚ÄúRenewing late cost me BHD 100 in fines once‚Äînow I tell every new founder: set two reminders, and never assume the system will auto-notify you on time.‚Äù\
\
Bahrain Business Customs: The Culture That Shapes Regulatory Realities\
Tangent? Perhaps. But understanding Bahrain‚Äôs unique business culture is not just a nice-to-have‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic advantage.\
\
Majlis-style Meetings: Important negotiations often take place over coffee, not in boardrooms‚Äîespecially in the Diplomatic Area.\
Ramadan Adjustments: Expect slower processing and shorter working hours; patience and respect go far.\
Coffee Service Protocols: Accepting coffee (even if you take only a sip) is a gesture of respect‚Äîrefusal is frowned upon.\
\
These traditions spill over into the bureaucratic process. Relationships and reputation matter. Staff at the Sijilat desk in Bahrain Bay will remember if you‚Äôre courteous and prepared‚Äîwhich honestly helped me through a sticky municipality approval snag last year.\

Bahrain wins on cost, speed, and ownership flexibility. The UAE‚Äôs free zones are efficient‚Äîbut can be expensive and restrictive outside of tech or professional sectors. Saudi Arabia offers a vast market, yet the local partner requirement and slow license process are frequent deal-breakers for SMEs.\
\
Bahrain: BHD 170‚Äì300 for most CRs, 100% ownership, typically 5‚Äì10 days setup.\
UAE: AED 12,000‚Äì30,000 (BHD 1,200‚Äì3,000+) for free zone licenses, local agent sometimes required.\
Saudi Arabia: SAR 10,000+ (BHD 1,000+), plus capital deposits, and mandatory Saudi partner in most sectors.\
\
Recommended Resources and Avoiding the Most Common Mistake\
\
Alt text: Professional business support: Business consultant advising client in a modern office.. They speak fluent English, handle 90% of paperwork, and know exactly which Sijilat codes to use to sidestep hidden surcharges.\
Most common mistake: Rushing document prep and missing a required item (especially the Arabic translations).\
Prevention strategy: Triple-check the Sijilat requirements online, have docs translated before you start, and always bring an extra hard copy to the MOICT desk.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
1. Can I register a company in Bahrain as a 100% foreign owner?\
Yes‚ÄîBahrain allows 100% foreign ownership for most business activities and sectors. Double-check the eligible activities and consider free zones for maximum flexibility.\
2. What is the total cost of commercial registration for a standard SME in Bahrain?\
Typical all-inclusive CR setup costs in 2025 range from BHD 170‚Äì300 for a basic LLC or SPC. Branches or specialized sectors pay more (detailed breakdown).\
3. How long does the registration process take in Bahrain?\
Thanks to the March 2025 Sijilat update, most new CR applications process in 5‚Äì10 business days‚Äîprovided all documents are complete and fees paid promptly (read how to fast-track your application).\
4. Are there annual fees or renewals I should be aware of?\
Yes‚Äîannual CR renewal (BHD 80‚Äì400) and Chamber membership renewal (BHD 20‚Äì60). Penalties apply for late renewals. Good bookkeeping (outsourcing info) helps you stay compliant.\
5. What documents are required for commercial registration in Bahrain?\
You‚Äôll need:\
- National ID/passport for all shareholders\
- Proof of address\
- Memorandum & Articles of Association\
- Activity codes (accurately identified via Sijilat)\
- Translations if documents are not in Arabic (full requirements)\

For further, up-to-date guidance and personalized support, see the Bahrain government portal, Reuters market analysis, or contact a reliable local service provider.

1nmgnld,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nmgnld,My DIY headphone project using AliExpress parts,"Hi, this is my DIY headphone project. As you can see, I used a Koss Portapro replica from AliExpress that came with its own cable. At first, I installed the drivers without any baffle, and they sounded really bad, almost like an ""evil harman"" tuning, then I covered the entire baffle with eva foam, but that made them way too dark, i ended up mounting them on a piece of eva foam with open spaces on the top and bottom, all sealed with this porous paper I found at home and firmly secured with masking tape.

I don‚Äôt have a lot to compare them to, but next to my CCZ Coffee Beam IEMs, they sound really similar. Compared to my Redragon Chroma Lamia 2, the only difference is that the Redragons have more expansive bass.

I built them into a pair of hearing protection earmuffs, also from AliExpress, these are wider than the typical 3M ones, just a heads-up, not all AliExpress earmuffs isolate well. I‚Äôll include a screenshot of the ones I recommend.

I‚Äôve always wanted a pair of headphones that are really durable, offer great isolation, but aren‚Äôt like Bluetooth ones that suck at blocking sudden high-frequency noises. I also love that I can just open these up, clean them, or replace any part. The cable exit is covered with hot glue (silicone) to help reduce microphonics.

I‚Äôm open to trying more expensive drivers in the future. However, a cable upgrade is unlikely‚ÄîI greatly prefer the comfort of a thin one and have no plans to make it replaceable, as simplicity is a priority. Furthermore, the vocal clarity is currently in a real sweet spot, so adding a mesh in front of the driver is out of the question. I've also considered 3D printing parts but seriously doubt the typical plastic used would provide the same level of sound isolation and resistance.

Last but not least, I have hyperacusis. I can‚Äôt listen to loud music or for long periods, so having headphones that isolate this well without the discomfort of IEMs lets me listen peacefully at low volumes. I've been in situations where I've cranked the volume all the way up by accident, and by instinct I throw them away, that is another great advantage of how resistant they are‚Ä¶

I mean, here I am, just chugging along in my 50s, thinking my biggest challenge was going to be finding the best bingo hall in town. Instead, I picked up a paddle and suddenly found myself giggling like a kid again. Seriously, have you ever tried running around chasing that little yellow ball? It‚Äôs exhilarating! 

Here are some reasons why I think you should grab a paddle ASAP:

- **Full-Body Workout**: It‚Äôs not just about the arms! Running around the court, shifting your weight, and lunging for that ball? Hello, core engagement!

- **Social Connection**: I‚Äôve met some amazing people! üçπ Sharing laughs and stories about how we (almost) missed the ball, while enjoying some pickleball banter? Sign me up!

- **Mental Boost**: You know that feeling of winning a point? Or just for hitting that perfect shot? Instant mood booster! Who needs therapy when you‚Äôve got adrenaline?

- **Low Impact, High Fun**: It‚Äôs much easier on the joints than, say, tennis. Trust me, my knees and I are dancing through this new hobby instead of groaning!

- **Easier to Learn**: If you can swing a paddle, you can join in! There‚Äôs not a ton of pressure ‚Äì everyone‚Äôs just there to have a good time (and show off their lightning-fast reflexes once in a while).

I honestly feel like I‚Äôve stumbled onto a hidden gem. I‚Äôm talking about a fun way to stay active while meeting new friends and flushing away the stress of everyday life. Who knew pickleball could be this magical?

I just had a heart palputation I believe. I was sitting on the toilet (just sitting not using the restroom), and my heart rate got really fast for a few seconds. Afterwards I started feeling a sort of ache in the middle of my chest and I started shivering (I think due to anxiety). My chest is still sore in the center but seems to relieve when I massage the middle of my sternum, and the shivering has mostly stopped. Although the soreness in the middle of my sternum was not there before the palputation. 

I did not feel a numbing sensation or any slurring. I can smile fine. Talk fine. Raise my arms. 

Context to maybe help:
I am male, 24, 5'11"", ~190lbs. I weightlift 4-5 days a week, I drink preworkout (approx. 200mg caffeine per day), although I did not workout today, but did drink coffee. I don't smoke, I drink socially. I've been taking tylenol/advil pm for the last few days, and plan to take 28mg diphenhydramine tonight. 

I drink creatine, magnesium (for rls symptoms) and protein supplements. 

I woke up a bit more irritable today, not sure why, and I ate more fast food today than usual. But that seems to be the only difference today. I drank 2.5 liters of water so far, usually about 3 liters. 

I'm not sure if I should be worried or what the next steps are? Can I wait to get to a PCP about this or is this an emergency? Can I workout tomorrow?

I've gone by my name for 7 years and started HRT immediately after moving out 2 years ago. 23. 

 Im growing facial hair but just shave before anytime I visit family, which is about once every week or two. Shaving in itself is fine and euphoric but not having facial hair is dysphoric. My dad is openly disgusted by trans people and has said queer people should die. My mom has seen my name tags over the years and makes comments but ignores it. My older sister of 14 years is pretty chill as a person.  I know she thinks being queer doesnt matter, her best friend is bisexual, and her 5 year old likes dresses and skirts and she just says she wishes people cared less. I just REALLY want to frown my facial hair out so I feel like I have to come out, and it'll help me pass more. If I lose people I lose people and its inevitable if I want to be happy. 

After two weeks of calling my sister a lot and stopping by her work at the end of the day to get her coffee (new job down the street so not odd) I kept putting it off. I started to dissociate about it and then just told her on Wednesday while I was a little over it to get it done with. 

She was supportive but seemed kind of at a loss and sounded sad about it. We could joke but she said she wished I told her sooner. That she thought I was just androgynous since I dont seem like 23 year old boys she knows. That she'll need time to adjust speech but it'll be fine and she just values my comfort and doesnt want to diminish the bond we've had. She doesnt know how my dad will take it but thinks our mom will freak out. She said she'd give them crap if they went no contact with me, so its just a matter of conflict that we'd have to figure out. Then she said she'd call me back and we'd talk about it more another time. 

I think thats good. But it feels weird. I know she was positively affirming but its so hard to learn not to feel scared. I know she's busy with her kids but Im waiting on the edge of my seat for a phone call back üíÄ

Kramer protests a bookban","Jerry's GF is very particular about sound systems, speakers headphones, etc. She only listens to specific music file types and vinyls on specific headphones made of specific materials

He finds whenever he plays something she'll immediately say it's poor quality. He thinks she's full of it and determines to buy great equipment, disguise it as ugly/old/bad and prove her wrong. 

George writes a letter to Dear Abby about his dating woes, parents, neuroses and losing his fiancee. Its wildly popular with women and he hears them every day comment how they wish they could meet him. 

Nobody believes its him. He starts writing a series of letters to Dear Abby with specific details about his life to prove it but they're being edited out or not published at all. 

Kramer goes to a bookstore that has a group trying to get them to ban some books, including an obscure pulp novel he read over and over as a lonely child. 

He protests and starts a ""read-in"" version of a sit-in  where they  bring their own books and take up seats. It makes the store look popular though and he also caves quickly to buying snacks/coffee and using their restroom. 

""It doesn't sound like you're protesting at all. It sounds like you're their best customer!""

He tries to devise better ways. 

Elaine dates a man who says he is a ghost writer for a popular romantic thriller series. He's written 3 of the 6 books and his are the most popular ones. 

He introduces her to the public author and they hit it off. He explicitly comments how he dislikes that the other guy gets all the credit and fans and the money isn't worth it. He's jealous and says if the other author wasn't so darn attractive and ""cover friendly"" as the ""face"" then HE would be able to get his picture on the back cover 

Elaine finds his little-brother syndrome annoying and notes that the Face is actually more attractive and is into HER as well. 

The ghost writer helps George write some later letters and ends up using it as am opportunity to claim HE is Despondent and Discouraged and finally get some publicity. 

The real writer has a signing at the bookstore Kramer is protesting at. He and Elaine have a secret tryst in the self-help section.

Kramer does a drastic measure that goes horribly wrong and the Face gets his face disfigured

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

Standing in the middle of my bedroom, I bend forward, letting my long, dark hair hang down, down, down‚Äîalmost touching the ground. I grab it with both hands, and with the help of years of practice, I swoop it up into an effortless, messy bun and slide the hair tie off my wrist to secure it to the top of my head.
I stand straight and look at the mirror hanging on my wall to see my dimly lit reflection staring back at me. My hair is dirty and tangled, but I don‚Äôt worry about it‚Äîno one knows but me. My skin feels oily, but I‚Äôm tired of caring for my everyday needs right now.

Ignoring myself, I walk out of the room, through the hallway, and into the kitchen with a rhythmic march. I walk to the stove and turn it on with purpose, as if it was something I‚Äôd thought about before doing it. I decide this means I‚Äôm making tea, so I pull the nearby, half-full kettle over to the reddening burner and go to the pantry to get a tea bag.

I approach the tea cabinet and pull open the top drawer. I scan the contents, but nothing catches my attention. I push the drawer closed with discontent and open the one below it. The first thing I notice is the box of green tea pouches. I pull one out as if it‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôd been looking for.

Then, with the same purposeful, brisk walk, I leave the pantry, march through the kitchen, the hallway, and into my bedroom. I snatch the mug I drained of my morning coffee hours earlier from my desk. I bring the two items‚Äîtea bag and mug‚Äîback to the kitchen and set them next to the stove, where the kettle still sits and the water inside is still smooth and unbothered by the heat underneath.

I lean back on the kitchen island behind me and stare at the stubborn kettle with impatience. I don‚Äôt necessarily want tea, and I‚Äôm not in a hurry for anything or anyone, but I want to want something‚Äîso I decide that wanting a big, steaming cup of bland green tea will have to be enough.

I sigh. Why is wanting so exhausting?

I wish I could just be satisfied with not wanting‚Äîsatisfied with satisfaction. But I know nothing is that simple.

And yet, here I am, executing my daily tasks in my daily schedule. Not happy, but not unhappy. I just want out of the simple‚Äînot for life to slow down or speed up, just for it to feel less monitored. And making tea in the middle of the day, after months of not drinking tea, seemed like success enough.

I give an unexpected grin to the tea kettle as it begins to whisper to me. It has no idea what I‚Äôm thinking‚Äîjust like the people around me, who are alive and animate but still don‚Äôt know. Even I, who think my own thoughts, haven‚Äôt got a clue what any of it means. It‚Äôs like I exist on an entirely different philosophical wavelength than I can even interpret myself.

I continue to stare at the kettle as I begin to notice a stinging sensation‚Äîone singular strand of hair pulling too tightly against my scalp in the tangle of knots I‚Äôve called a bun. With complete disassociation, I fold my body over again and pull the tie from my hair‚Äîjust as the kettle starts to screech at me.

But I don‚Äôt care.

I continue the familiar motion of smoothing out my hair and redoing it all over again.

The earth is a sphere but our consciousness resides in a dimension which is a plain. Paradoxical to this, the mind is the creator of the shape of all it interprets by being the sole, 'soul projector'. Subliminal manipulation is the corner stone of our society. The only thing that exists is the energy of the whole. Which is what we all are. You and your coffee table are the same atoms perceived differently.

You and your table and your couch and your dog and your car and your friends and the trees and the fungi and the stars and the universe are all atoms vibrating on a frequency that is recognised by a debated fact called consciousness. From a flat fabric we create then project an external code forming an environment. We exist from ancient laws and codes which are yet to be fathomed. Time doesn't exist without measurement that entropy forces us to give.

We have tricked ourselves into imagining that the illusion is real for soul purpose of consciously rediscovering what we truly are.

It frustrates me that, it's been scientifically proposed on with great merit that we exist in a holographic matrix,  built by atoms through binary coding, given information by a quantum field and fundamentally only viewed as solid because were only here for a short and slow enough amount of time that what we see and interact with is conceived and viewed as a solid environment. There is absolutely no law or manifest by our common man that is real. Only ideas deemed to constitute some sort of a society which is perceived as appropriate. While helpful in some aspects, we exist in a debatable state of existence and on any given day our dignity and safety are threatened in a never ending loop of fear and control.

I am a lesbian as well as introvert and so on. 

I am glad to be single. 

I mean, we all used to be able to fit a gazillion things into a day; now you can wake up at 6-630 am, be done your morning by 7am and by the time your coffee pot is done making your coffee it is almost 9am. 

The absolute hell. 

But being that I‚Äôm also mildly autistic and such a Forrest Gump with it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just glad I can do anything at all. So what I can‚Äôt drive, work and all else I said?‚Ä¶ But that doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt care, that I don‚Äôt know it and know how to. It is just that it has proven like I said that no matter what I do; it doesn‚Äôt work or change anything for me. 

Some of us like Forrest Gump; we know it all and know how to it all. But for the life of us nothing changes for us and it just doesn‚Äôt work. 

I don‚Äôt want friends and a relationship. I like being introverted and such. 

 But seeing as I‚Äôm also gay it is there if something did ever happen. 

I rather be to myself in this regard. 

This CK shit has gotten out of hand. The celebrating is the fact that there is one less bad person. Not the how it happened.

We're constantly juggling responsibilities, chasing goals, and trying to find a sense of balance. It's easy to get caught up in the routine, so much so that we forget to pause and appreciate the journey.
The Myth of Perfect Balance
Many of us strive for a ""perfect work-life balance,"" a state where every aspect of our lives is neatly compartmentalized and equally prioritized. But what if that ideal is a myth? Life isn't a spreadsheet; it's a dynamic, ever-changing dance. Some days, work demands more of you; others, your family or personal well-being needs your full attention. The key isn't to achieve a static balance, but to learn how to find your rhythm‚Äîto shift your focus intentionally and without guilt.
Think of it like a musician playing a song. They don't play every note with the same force. They change their tempo and volume to create a beautiful melody. We can do the same with our lives, adjusting our energy to what each day requires.
Embracing the Imperfections
Social media often shows us curated snapshots of people's lives‚Äîhighlight reels that can make us feel like we're falling behind. We see flawless homes, perfect vacations, and unblemished successes. But real life is full of imperfections. There will be days when things don't go as planned, when you feel tired, or when you simply don't have all the answers.
Embracing these imperfections is a powerful act of self-acceptance. It's about recognizing that growth doesn't happen in a straight line. It's messy, and that's okay. When you let go of the need for everything to be perfect, you create space for authenticity, resilience, and genuine joy.
The Power of Small Moments
In our quest for big, life-changing moments, we sometimes overlook the small, ordinary ones that truly shape our happiness. The quiet cup of coffee in the morning, a spontaneous conversation with a friend, the feeling of the sun on your face‚Äîthese are the moments that weave together to form the rich tapestry of our lives.
Make a conscious effort to notice these details. Take a few minutes each day to be fully present. Put your phone away and just be. This practice of mindfulness can ground you and remind you that a beautiful life is built not from grand gestures, but from the accumulation of simple, joyful moments.
So, as you navigate the chaos, remember to be kind to yourself. You are not a machine meant for constant output. You are a person, and your journey is a unique one. Find your rhythm, embrace the imperfections, and cherish the small moments that make it all worthwhile.

>AI can transform businesses, but only if the CEO leads the charge and pairs with a strategist who gets tech. Here‚Äôs why, plus a real-world story of how my team made it happen for a manufacturing company. Let‚Äôs discuss: who‚Äôs driving AI in your world?

# Why CEOs Need to Own AI Transformation (And Why They Can‚Äôt Do It Alone)

Hey Reddit, I‚Äôve been chewing on a big question: who‚Äôs supposed to steer the ship when AI‚Äôs flipping business upside down? I‚Äôve spent years diving into tech‚ÄîAI, data, the works‚Äîand I keep coming back to one answer: the CEO. Not some tech guru or a random manager, but the top dog. But here‚Äôs the real talk: they need a strategist who lives and breathes this stuff to make it work. Let me break it down, share a story, and get your take.

# Why the CEO‚Äôs the Only One for the Job

AI isn‚Äôt just a shiny new toy. It‚Äôs a game-changer that can rewrite how a company runs, from crunching numbers to delighting customers. I‚Äôm talking about an *intelligent enterprise*‚Äîa business where data flows like oxygen and decisions get smarter every day. That‚Äôs not a small tweak; it‚Äôs a total overhaul. And who‚Äôs got the clout to pull that off?

Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs gotta be the CEO:

* **Big-Picture Power**: Only the CEO can get sales, ops, HR, and tech to march to the same beat. No one else can break the silos.
* **Culture Shaper**: They set the vibe‚Äî**‚ÄúNo more coasting‚Äù**‚Äîand make constant change the new normal, not a one-off project.
* **Decision Muscle**: They greenlight the big bets, like investing in AI to dodge supply chain disasters or boost margins.

I‚Äôve seen it go south when AI‚Äôs handed off to a side team. Projects fizzle, budgets dry up, and everyone‚Äôs pointing fingers. But when the CEO steps up? That‚Äôs when the magic happens. It‚Äôs not about hitting a finish line‚Äîit‚Äôs about building a machine that keeps evolving.

# Why a Strategist Is the Secret Sauce

Okay, so the CEO‚Äôs the driver. But let‚Äôs be real: they‚Äôre swamped. Running a company while decoding AI, quantum tech, or IoT? That‚Äôs a tall order. They need a wingman‚Äîa strategist who can translate tech chaos into a clear path. Not the coder in the basement, but someone who gets the business side and can say, **‚ÄúStrategy trumps tech every time.‚Äù**

Here‚Äôs what a strategist brings to the table:

* **Clarity**: They turn ‚Äúcool AI stuff‚Äù into ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how we grow revenue or cut costs.‚Äù
* **Connection**: They bridge the CEO‚Äôs vision with the nitty-gritty‚Äîdata insights, tech tools, team buy-in.
* **Future-Proofing**: They spot trends (like predictive models or edge computing) and keep the plan tight.

The CEO dreams big; the strategist makes it real. It‚Äôs a partnership, not a solo act.

# A Real-World Win: How We Made AI Work for Apex Manufacturing

Let me tell you about Apex Manufacturing‚Äîa mid-sized outfit stuck in the slow lane. Their CEO, Lisa, knew AI could shake things up, maybe fix their messy supply chain or predict demand spikes. But she was drowning in day-to-day fires and jargon overload. So she called me in.

I brought my squad: strategy analysts who eat data for breakfast and AI tech experts who speak fluent algorithm. Here‚Äôs how we rolled:

1. **Kickoff**: Lisa and I grabbed coffee. She said, ‚ÄúI want us leaner, smarter‚Äîwhere do we start?‚Äù We nailed down her goal: a supply chain that doesn‚Äôt choke under pressure.
2. **Data Hunt**: My analyst, Sam, dug into Apex‚Äôs numbers‚Äîshipments, delays, forecasts. He found gold: patterns in shipping lags no one had clocked.
3. **Framing the Win**: I told Lisa, **‚ÄúThis is our wedge.‚Äù** My tech crew sketched a predictive model to spot bottlenecks before they hit.
4. **Getting Buy-In**: I worked with Lisa to rally her ops head and CFO. It wasn‚Äôt all high-fives‚Äîthere were debates, but we got alignment.
5. **Making It Happen**: The tech team built the model, I kept things on track, and Lisa pushed her crew to trust it.
6. **Results**: Six months later, Apex cut costs by 15% and dodged a peak-season meltdown. Lisa‚Äôs take? **‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt just fix a problem‚Äîwe built a muscle.‚Äù**

That‚Äôs the power of a CEO leading and a strategist guiding. No fluff‚Äîjust results.

# Why This Matters Now (And Why You Should Care)

AI‚Äôs not waiting around. It‚Äôs moving fast, and it‚Äôs dragging a posse of tech‚Äîquantum, IoT, data ecosystems‚Äîalong for the ride. Companies that nail this will own the future; those that don‚Äôt will be roadkill. Here‚Äôs the deal:

* **The Stakes Are High**: The gap between winners and losers is growing. **‚ÄúThe future‚Äôs built one choice at a time.‚Äù**
* **CEOs Set the Tone**: They‚Äôre the ones who can say, ‚ÄúThis is ours to own,‚Äù and make it stick.
* **Strategists Amplify**: A good one turns vision into action, keeping the CEO focused and the plan sharp.

# What‚Äôs Next? Let‚Äôs Talk

Reddit, you‚Äôre the real MVPs for hashing out big ideas. So, what‚Äôs your take? Is your CEO ready to lead the AI charge, or are they passing the buck? Got a story of AI saving the day‚Äîor crashing and burning? Drop it in the comments. Upvote if this hits home, share it with your crew, and let‚Äôs get this convo going. **AI‚Äôs rewriting business‚Äîhow are we rewriting leadership?**",1,1758420369.0,u_Sani_Abdul-Jabbar,0,1.0,False

I used to be such a horrendous gooner that I couldn‚Äôt go to public places like this. But I got the help I needed and I started to do much better.

The biggest mistake I made was opening Reddit in the coffee shop. First thing that came up was the Overwatch circle jerk post with genjis head on a sexy big boobed woman‚Äôs body. It got me super riled up and I began foaming at the mouth.

Then I had the following internal battle:

No‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm stronger than this‚Ä¶. I can fight it! I know I can. I‚Äôve been consistent with therapy and my new medication. I‚Äôm stronger than my urges. I‚Äôm in control. I‚Äôm in control‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm not in control. 

‚ÄúGAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH‚Äù I screamed.‚ÄúLET THE DRAGON BECOME ME!‚Äù

I stood up in a rush and knocked my chair over. I threw my coffee mug at the wall, it shattered and sprayed coffee everywhere. Coffee patrons began screaming.

I ripped off my kimono, and moved my g-string to the side to expose my raging erection. I then 
began vigorously jerking with both hands while making motorcycle revving noises. I felt truly alive. Fuck therapy. Fuck these meds. I don‚Äôt need any of that shit. I just need to be ME.

Everyone who was in the coffee shop still was screaming and attempting to evacuate. As if I actually posed a threat to them? I‚Äôm just gooning to sexy genji, what about that makes them think I‚Äôm going to kill them? I stopped jerking for a second and singled out a woman who was behind the counter, looking at me with large, terrified eyes. I approached her, furious that she saw me as a threat. I screamed in her face, ‚ÄúWHAT, DO YOU THINK IM GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU OR SOMETHING?? IM NOT HURTING ANYONE YOU BITCH.‚Äù I almost wanted to slap her I was so mad. I stopped myself from hurting her as I remembered the objective, and I went back to my phone at my table and continued jerking. Both hands, hard.

The police arrived shortly after, a whole squadron, pointing guns at me and everything. They tased me, and then tackled me and roughed me up. Then they put me in handcuffs and stuck me in the car. They treated me like a dangerous, violent criminal‚Ä¶ 

How do I get out of this guys? This was all u/SharpyLeko512 ‚Äòs fault. If he hadn‚Äôt posted that pic of sexy genji I wouldn‚Äôt have lost all my self control, and gotten arrested for the aftermath.

I‚Äôm thinking I will sue him in court. And then I will be exonerated of the following charges: destruction of property, public disturbance, public nudity, and lewd conduct. Then I will once more be a free man.

Hey everyone! I‚Äôm 24M in the Bay Area ‚Äî turning 25 in just 5 days. 

A little about me: I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, 150 lbs, and I try to stay active by hitting the gym about 5 times a week. I am selectively extraverted but people usually describe me as caring, thoughtful, and family-oriented. I really enjoy movies, hiking, traveling, dancing, badminton, long walks, and diving into deep conversations ‚Äî the kind that make you lose track of time. I also love exploring new restaurants and coffee spots, or just chilling with good music.

I‚Äôm genuinely looking for something long-term and meaningful, not just casual dating. If you‚Äôre in the Bay Area, around my age, and some of this resonates, I‚Äôd love to connect. I‚Äôm also open to making new friends‚Ä¶Sometimes the best relationships, romantic or otherwise, start from a genuine connection.",1,1758420059.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1nmfvpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/R4R30Plus/comments/1nmfvpk/31f4m_californiaonline_i_might_just_be_your_idea/,31[F4M] California/Online - I might just be your idea of the good kind of chaos‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm usually about 5 minutes late to every event I‚Äôm invited to with a coffee in hand. By 9:30am there is something on my shirt (coffee usually). I can‚Äôt ever find my phone. I lock my keys in my car weekly, and my desk drawers are filled with junk from open enrollment 3 years ago because I might still need that paper I can get on the online portal and at minimum 3 salad dressing‚Äôs. But I like every other hotdog lover I  turn my neon hot dog sign on, one button at a time. And I‚Äôm looking for someone who likes their life with a little bit of well intentioned chaos and sprinkle of humor. 

I‚Äôm seeking someone who thinks the idea of drinking a pitcher of beer at the dive bar and taking over the TouchTunes with deep cuts of bands you definitely know aren‚Äôt played there ‚Ä¶.ever, sounds like a fun date night. Doesn‚Äôt absolutely hate that I love hot dogs in an unironic non performative way. Understands that while I love the gym - that is not me saying I want to be gym buddies. I love concerts and have been to over 200+ and it‚Äôs important to me that you‚Äôre outgoing and enjoy events and such and can handle crowds. Bonus points for Midwest Emo lovers, wanna sit in my car and cry? I primarily watch football and baseball, but I think hockey is an absolute blast too, despite a lack of knowledge. I need someone who understands I have tattoos and will not be shocked to hear I got a new one that is more strange than last one. Someone who knows that I‚Äôve never met a stranger, and I‚Äôll talk to anyone and everyone. 

I will say what probably excludes me from otherwise good matches is that I don‚Äôt enjoy video games or anime. Neither of these interest me. I can deal with hobbyist gamers and anime enthusiasts - but I won‚Äôt watch you play or watch it with you. Not my jam. 

For me mutual attraction is NECESSARY and I will be honest if I don‚Äôt find you attractive as I assume, once you scroll, yes SCROLL, through my photos, you find me, I‚Äôll tell you. I am honest. I am 5‚Äô6 for reference on the thicker side. Included photos of me full body, at the gym, no make up etc. https://imgur.com/a/BzXz3em

I‚Äôm not sure why I have to say this, but if your idea of a first message is to tell me you hate something I‚Äôve said I love that won‚Äôt work for me. 
Ideally here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeking - a connection that starts friendly with mild flirting that we build off. You are ~26-40. You must indicate you read this post in someway shape or form. I don‚Äôt care what it is, you can tell me about the time your mom dropped you as a baby, you got lost at the zoo, or even your first concert, but for the love of god don‚Äôt just say ‚Äúhey‚Äù or ‚Äúhi‚Äù or I won‚Äôt respond.

Hello fellow creeps. This is my first ever story on reddit (second if you count posting this on r/CreepCast_Submissions first). I pray that Hunter and Isaiah will read this in the future, and to anyone else who reads this I would love some criticism. Thank you for reading and I hope you like the story.

‚ÄúTo Tommy and his fiance! Cheers!‚Äù¬†

A man and his friends clink their mugs together and each takes deep swigs. Wiping the foam off his top lip, the man slapped Tommy on the back and reached for another buffalo wing when his phone began to buzz. Rubbing his fingers on his napkin, he took out his phone and saw the caller. ‚ÄúLove of my life‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúSorry guys, I got to go.‚Äù The man said. ‚ÄúMy girlfriend is calling.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go dude‚Äù One of his friends called out, clearly drunk already. ‚ÄúI better- I better see you again later tonig‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off before slumping in his seat.

The man got up from his chair and pushed past the other patrons and dodged pool cues as he opened the doors to the pub and stepped outside in the chilling March breeze. Slightly trembling, he rubbed his hands together and answered the call to the yelling of his girlfriend.¬†

‚ÄúWhere are you?! I thought you said you were going to come home and watch Real Housewives!‚Äù She shouted, her voice cutting through the background chatter coming from behind the pub doors.¬†

‚ÄúI told you I was going to do it tomorrow!‚Äù He hissed back. ‚ÄúTommy just got engaged and me and my friends had to celebrate.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBullshit! You know why we can‚Äôt do it tomorrow!‚Äù His girlfriend spat.¬†

While his girlfriend continued yelling at the man, he couldn‚Äôt shake off the feeling something was watching him. He glanced around with his phone still in his ear. The street he was on had one streetlight, and standing underneath it was an old woman. A chill zipped up his spine. There was an old woman staring at him. She had unkept, stringy white hair that made her look like she had white electricity crackling off her scalp. Her wrinkled, sagging jowls were dotted with liver spots and hung off of her face like melted cheese. Her lips looked like two caterpillars made of leather. Her eyes were a greenish-gray, like the windows on a sunken submarine. Everything about this old woman creeped the man out.¬†

‚ÄúUh, hey, I‚Äôm going to need to call you later.‚Äù The man said.¬†

Before he could hear her response, he hung up on his girlfriend and slipped his phone into his pocket. The man walked towards the old woman, careful with each step to not trigger her. The old woman‚Äôs eyes, glassy and empty, continued to bore into the man.¬†

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam? Can I help you?‚Äù The man said.¬†

The old woman didn‚Äôt respond. The man noticed that she was wearing what looked like a browned and stained¬† hospital gown. Maybe she had come from the nearby hospital?¬†

‚ÄúDo you need some help getting back to your room?‚Äù The man asked slowly. ‚ÄúI can help you find your way back.‚Äù

Suddenly, the old woman‚Äôs leathery lips curled into a large smile, revealing an array of brownish-yellow crooked teeth that looked like sandy pebbles hammered into her gums. The old woman released a wheezing laugh that followed with a gurgling cough, making her sound like a balloon releasing air and soap bubbles. Flecks of spit flew out of her mouth and one landed on the man‚Äôs shirt. This caused the man to begin to back up, keeping his eyes on her just until he felt the bars to the pub doors brush his fingers. The man turned around and was just about to head back inside when he felt a powerful grip grab on his wrist. His arm was wrenched backwards, shooting pain into his shoulders. The man‚Äôs face was forced back to point at the old woman, his nose almost touching a large, brown wart on hers. The old woman, her face still arched with that ghoulish grin, suddenly lunged her face forwards. Her leathery lips bit down on the man‚Äôs and the man felt something warm and muscular forced into his mouth. The man immediately pushed himself off the old woman, separating their locked lips. He cocked back his fist instinctively and threw a punch at the old woman. It connected with a gravely crunch on her nose, spurting blood out. She immediately crumbled. The man looked down at the old woman. Her limbs were strewn and bent in separate directions, reminding the man of a dead bird. But the old woman‚Äôs dusty green eyes still lingered on the man‚Äôs, keeping her eyes on his.¬†

\*\*\*\*\*\*		

A man wakes up, groggy with a splitting headache, in his bed. His back laid in a pool of his own sweat, sticking his bedsheets to his skin. His vision was blurred, so with one tired hand, he rubbed his eyes. Blinking again, he noticed that his vision was still off. The dresser that he usually saw out of the corner to the right of his room was missing. He turned his head and saw that it was still there, but why couldn‚Äôt he see it earlier? The man took his right hand and moved it forwards and backwards in front of his eye. Nothing. He couldn‚Äôt see his right hand.¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù The man grumbled.¬†

He swung his legs over the edge of his bed and lurched to his bathroom. Looking into the mirror, he noticed something strange. His right eye wasn‚Äôt the blueish gray like his left. His right eye was a foggy green, like the algae in an old, unkept fishbowl. The man quickly rubbed his eyes again, questioning if this was some post-hangover hallucination even though something like this has never happened before. Furiously blinking his eyes again, his right eye was still the same foggy green as before.¬†

‚ÄúDid- did I put in a contact last night or something?‚Äù The man wondered out loud.¬†

He opened up his right eyelids with his right hand and reached into his right eye with one left forefinger. He accidentally reached too far, prodding his iris. But the man didn‚Äôt even flinch. He didn‚Äôt have to. He didn‚Äôt feel anything in that eye. The man prodded it again, but instead of feeling pain, he felt something pushing his eye back. Suddenly, his green eye moved. It rolled, like a bowling ball down the gutter, down his eyelid and bulged out the skin in his face as it crawled down. The man‚Äôs vision on his right side faded back as he watched as his right eye, the¬† same blueish-grey as his left, popped back into his eye socket with a sick squelch. The green eye slid down onto the man‚Äôs tongue as his mouth hung agape and then it slickly melted into a green mucus and slid down his throat. The man stared back at the mirror, unable to comprehend what he had just seen and felt. He kept on blinking again and again, feverishly rubbing his eyes. He pried open his eyelids again and checked on his right eye again. Blueish-gray. Not a foggy green, not a foggy green that was like pale algae, it was a blueish gray like cartoon thunderclouds. The man sighed and reached for his razor, ready to continue with his morning routine until he felt something. Something tapping his front teeth. Slowly and shakily, the man opened his mouth. A long, thin finger was tapping his front tooth. It was hot pink and wrinkled, with a pale pink fingernail on the end. The man immediately screamed and the finger slithered back down the man‚Äôs throat like a rat snake darting back into its hole. Rushing to the toilet, the man began heaving and tried to puke out the finger. His heart pounding with fear, the man continued to heave and gag but with no avail. After twenty minutes of dry heaving, the man began to sob, resting his head on his arm to not make contact with the toilet seat. But then, a voice cut through the sobs of the man, immediately forcing a stop to his whimpers.¬†

‚ÄúStop‚Äù

A whisper had escaped from the man‚Äôs throat. But the man didn‚Äôt move his lips. He didn‚Äôt say that. The whisper was hoarse and weak, like the voice of an old man on his deathbed. The man immediately ran back to the bathroom mirror and opened his mouth. In the back of his throat was a set of small, tiny teeth circling his throat. Suddenly, the man felt his own throat close in on itself as the tiny set of teeth began speaking again.¬†

‚ÄúAre you ready to talk?‚Äù

The man, with tears welled up in his eyes, began to respond.¬†

‚ÄúWho- who are- who are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlexander Carren Hormel.‚Äù

Suddenly, the man slammed his fists on his sink and yelled out.¬†

‚ÄúHow did you know- who- how- HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI can feel your hippocampus. I know your memories. Now, you must listen to what I have to say.‚Äù

Alexander‚Äôs chest was heaving up and down. What does that mean, he knows his memories? What could that mean? Would it be able to see every happy memory with his family? Every passionate evening with his girlfriend? Every rowdy night out with his friends? Would that thing be able to rewatch his first bicycle ride? His first kiss? His bittersweet goodbye to his father? Alexander had too many questions and his mind was racing too fast.¬†

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlexander Carren Hormel.‚Äù The voice responded. ‚ÄúI am Alexander Carren Hormel. Now, go downstairs and eat.‚Äù¬†

Gulping, Alexander shuffled out his bathroom shaking. He reached the staircase, fear weakening his knees as he stumbled his way down the stairs. He made his way to his kitchen and opened up his pantry doors, looking around for anything that could satisfy that thing. He quickly snatched a loaf of bread, took out two slices and then opened his fridge and took out a package of ham and a jar of mayo. Alexander quickly made himself a sandwich, and then ate it right in his kitchen. Alexander then got up and reached for his coffee pot before feeling tapping on his teeth again. After opening his mouth again, the thing in the back of his throat began speaking again.¬†

‚ÄúNo coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Alexander responded, trying to not sound scared.¬†

‚ÄúCoffee stunts growth.‚Äù The voice whispered back.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not growing anymore.‚Äù Alexander said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm twenty five.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot growth for you. Growth for me.‚Äù¬†

Alexander‚Äôs face fell and his eyes widened.¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you mean you‚Äôre still growing?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am a growing child. And a growing child needs fruits and vegetables to grow big and strong. Prepare some fruits and vegetables for us now.‚Äù

Alexander opened up his fridge again and looked around.¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing. I was supposed to go grocery shopping today.‚Äù Alexander mumbled.¬†

‚ÄúThat cannot do.‚Äù The thing responded. ‚ÄúOrder groceries off your phone now.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Alexander argued, feeling a surge of defiance . ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I just go to the grocery store?‚Äù

Suddenly, a tube of pink flesh shot out of Alexander‚Äôs mouth, forcing his jaw open. It was as long and as thick as Alexander‚Äôs forearm but felt hollow, like he had a wet cardboard tube in his mouth. Hot breath was shuttling out from inside the tube, pulsating on Alexander‚Äôs tongue and painfully stretching his cheeks with each beat. The tube split into two halves on the end with a row of horselike teeth, each as long as Alexander‚Äôs thumb. Alexander‚Äôs lungs were forced empty as a shout of hot air funneled from the tube and out the jaw.¬†

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù The tube bellowed. ‚ÄúYOU WILL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE! NOT NOW!‚Äù

With tears of pain in his eyes, Alexander nodded in defeat. The tube slithered its way back down his throat, the horselike teeth scraping against Alexander‚Äôs front incisors. As soon as the tube was all the way down, Alexander began gasping for breath. After filling up his lungs again, the thing spoke.

‚ÄúYou will be ordering online. Take out your phone and order.‚Äù

Alexander took out his phone and tapped on his delivery app, ordering anything he thought the thing would want.¬†

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù The thing muttered. ‚ÄúNow, go and change. We cannot have the delivery man see us undressed.‚Äù

Alexander lumbered up the stairs, feeling as if he had gained ten pounds. His adrenaline-filled knees now felt like they were injected with lead. He shuffled to his room and took out a dress shirt and pants. After getting dressed, Alexander spotted something that might help him. A pen and a notepad on his nightstand. After running to the bathroom and checking his eyes to make sure the thing wasn‚Äôt watching, he scribbled down some words on a piece of paper and tucked it in his pocket. Walking down back to the living room, Alexander rested on his couch, letting his exhaustion take over.¬†

‚ÄúWhy are you doing this to me? Why me?‚Äù He moaned.

Alexander felt a tap on his front tooth and swinged open his mouth.¬†

‚ÄúYou have ideal genetic code. You are young enough.‚Äù The thing cooed back.¬†

‚ÄúStop- don‚Äôt give me that bullshit.‚Äù Alexander angrily responded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a real reason. Why did you pick me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are young. You are able-bodied.‚Äù The thing purred. ‚ÄúYou can act as a sufficient host.‚Äù¬†

Alexander‚Äôs brow furrowed and felt his heart beat faster. He didn‚Äôt know if it was rage or fear filling his body this time.¬†

‚ÄúHost? What do you mean by host?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt ready.‚Äù

Alexander rocketed himself off the couch and began yelling, even if there was nothing he could yell at.¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not ready‚Äô?! This is my body we‚Äôre talking about here! I deserve to know!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDo not yell at me.‚Äù The thing whispered back hoarsely.

‚ÄúSHUT UP AND ANSWER MY QUESTION!‚Äù Alexander hollered out.¬†

A thin, pink arm forced Alexander‚Äôs lips open, flipped its wrist around and shot the hand at Alexander‚Äôs face. The hand was flat and long, with sharp pale nails that resembled pink sand glass. The hand hooked its thumb and two end fingers onto Alexander‚Äôs face, digging its nails in Alexander‚Äôs cheeks and drawing blood. The hand hovered its middle and pointer fingers just above Alexander‚Äôs eyes, the sharp glasslike nails just millimeters away from his irises. Alexander watched as the skin on the palm split open a thin crevice like a papercut and a multitude of tiny, pebblelike teeth revealed themselves as the lipless mouth opened to speak.¬†

‚ÄúDo not yell at me.‚Äù The mouth hissed. ‚ÄúI have fingers smaller than these,‚Äù It said, wiggling its fingers, ‚Äúhooked to your spinal cord. I will crush and sever everything below your shoulders, and then use my own arms to move and feed myself. The only reason why I haven‚Äôt done that is because I don‚Äôt want to, as I would rather have you feed me.‚Äù

The arm quickly climbed back down Alexander‚Äôs throat, releasing the tension on his jaw and leaving a trail of mucus on Alexander‚Äôs lips. Alexander slumped back down into the couch, heaving in air to make up for all he just lost. Hot tears had begun streaming down his face again. His tears began pooling into his shirt collar when the thing spoke again.¬†

‚ÄúNo crying. You cannot have puffy eyes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy.‚Äù Alexander sniffled.¬†

‚ÄúThe delivery person will have their suspicions.‚Äù¬†

As soon as the thing said that, the doorbell rang with a shrill *DING!*, startling Alexander. He wiped the remaining tears away and trudged to the front door. An old man in a delivery vest stood in the doorway holding a bag of groceries.¬†

‚ÄúIs this 217 Lincoln street?‚Äù The old man grunted.¬†

Alexander nodded his head. The old man set the bag down in front of Alexander‚Äôs feet. He then pulled out a credit card reader attached to his phone.¬†

‚ÄúWould you like to leave a tip?‚Äù¬†

Alexander swallowed his spit and nodded again. A swell of adrenaline fired from his stomach to his arms and fingers. He reached into his pocket and took out his wallet. With shaking hands, he picked out his credit card, but also pinched a folded up paper underneath his card. He reached out his hand to the reader, a bead of sweat falling down his forehead. Alexander tapped the card on the reader. It made a small *DING*. Alexander was about to release his fingers and drop the folded paper on the old man‚Äôs phone when the thing spoke again, muffled from behind his lips.¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you think you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù

Alexander froze. He had been caught.¬†

‚ÄúDid you say somethin‚Äô?‚Äù The old man mumbled.¬†

Alexander shook his head. With a sunken heart, he slowly took his credit card back and placed it in his wallet, keeping the folded piece of paper next to it. Alexander closed the door, and the thing immediately knocked on his teeth again. Opening his mouth, Alexander‚Äôs sunken heart suddenly jumped back up racing. It was over for him.

‚ÄúWhat were you trying to do?‚Äù The thing growled.¬†

‚ÄúNothing- I was doing nothing-.‚Äù Alexander stammered out.¬†

‚ÄúTake out that paper from your wallet.‚Äù The thing demanded.¬†

Alexander could feel his throat close up and he hurriedly reached into his pocket and took out his wallet. Fumbling around his various cards and dollar bills, he pinched the piece of paper he had nestled away next to his credit card. Trembling, he took it out of his wallet.

‚ÄúI need to see.‚Äù The thing hissed.¬†

Suddenly, Alexander felt his right eye being pushed upwards and his vision there went dark.¬†

‚ÄúUnfold it.‚Äù The thing imposed.¬†

Alexander whimpered again.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm- I‚Äôm sorry. Please, I'm sorry.‚Äù He moaned.¬†

The fleshy, pink tube shot out of Alexander‚Äôs jaw again, wrenching him forwards and causing him to stumble. The toothy mouth on the end opened and bellowed out with a hot breath.

‚ÄúUNFOLD IT NOW!‚Äù

Quivering, Alexander unfolded the paper. On it, with rushed handwriting, Alexander wrote:

*Please help. There is a parasite in my body that is going to kill me. Please call a doctor or the police.*

For what seemed like the hundredth time that day, tears had fallen down Alexander‚Äôs cheeks again. It was over. That thing was going to take its fingers and jam them into my vertebrae, Alexander thought. Would begging for mercy even work? What would he say? That he would continue to be a slave, a steed for that thing to drive his body around in like a brand new Cadillac? Like it wasn‚Äôt doing that already? Begging would‚Äôve been useless, because who needs a Cadillac that tries to rid itself of its owner? Alexander wasn‚Äôt even scared of the thing anymore, he had accepted that it wasn‚Äôt going to leave anytime soon. But the fear in his heart didn‚Äôt come from the thing itself, with its stringy fingers and a fleshy tube for a jaw. It came from what punishment that thing would give to Alexander. 	

Finally, after what seemed like hours of Alexander fearing what was going to happen next, the thing rolled its eye back and restored vision to Alexander‚Äôs right eye. It tapped a finger on Alexander‚Äôs teeth and he opened his mouth. Finally, the thing spoke again.¬†

‚ÄúAre you trying to abandon me?‚Äù It asked.¬†

Alexander furiously shook his head.¬†

‚ÄúNo- no no I- I wasn‚Äôt trying to do that I-‚Äù But he was cut off by the thing before he could finish his sentence.¬†

‚ÄúAre you trying to kill me?‚Äù It asked again.¬†

‚ÄúI- I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing- I was just-‚Äù Alexander stammered again like a schoolboy who got in trouble with his teacher. But the thing cut him off again with a hoarse shout.¬†

‚ÄúARE YOU TRYING TO LEAVE?!‚Äù¬†

Alexander closed his eyes, pushing out the tears that were welled up in his eyes. Slowly, he nodded his head.¬†

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù The thing said. ‚ÄúI get it. I am being unfair to you, aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù

Alexander opened his eyes again. Was the thing showing him sympathy?¬†

‚ÄúI guess this should be uncomfortable to you, shouldn‚Äôt it?‚Äù¬†

Alexander nodded his head.

‚ÄúThen I think the best thing for the both of us would be to hurry it up. I think we must start the split early.‚Äù¬†

Alexander‚Äôs eyes bulged out. Another bead of sweat dripped down his back and sent shivers down his spine.¬†

‚ÄúWhat is the spli-‚Äù¬†

Before Alexander was even able to finish his answer, he suddenly felt an immense, tortuous hunger. He immediately bent over in pain, his stomach paining with hunger so terrible it sapped the energy from his entire body.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt kneel. It‚Äôs time to eat.‚Äù The thing whispered.¬†

Alexander took the bag of groceries and rushed to the kitchen. Taking out a tomato, he opened the sink and was about to run water over it when the thing yelled at him again.¬†

‚ÄúNo time! Just eat it!‚Äù The thing urged.¬†

Alexander, his hunger still pounding and stabbing into his stomach like he was being hit with a spiked bat, immediately obeyed the thing and shoved the tomato in his mouth. Gnashing and chewing, Alexander immediately finished the tomato. The juice was sticky, coating Alexander‚Äôs face with red and dropping seeds in between his chin stubble. He reached back inside the bag and dumped out the rest of the vegetables, dusting his counter with dirt. He ate them all, devouring bell peppers, crushing cucumbers and crunching down potatoes. But his hunger continued to torment him, the pain making Alexander scream. Desperate to eat more, Alexander took out a package of raw ground beef. He rushed to the stove and opened the package. He was about to dump the beef into the pan when the thing roared at Alexander again.¬†

‚ÄúNo time! Eat it now!‚Äù¬†

Alexander tried to respond, trying to interject that he couldn‚Äôt eat raw beef, but the thing ignored him. Multiple thin, pink strands resembling veins rapidly slithered out from the sides and roof of Alexander‚Äôs mouth and forced Alexander‚Äôs mouth open. They scooped up a large hunk of the beef and slithered back into Alexander‚Äôs mouth, forcing the beef down his throat. Alexander tried gagging and forcing the beef back up, but some of the tendrils shot out again and melted together, forming a crude hand. It forced itself onto Alexander‚Äôs face, keeping his mouth closed. A small opening peeked open from the back of the hand and began speaking at Alexander.¬†

‚ÄúSwallow. Swallow it and keep it down. I need the nutrients.‚Äù

Alexander nodded and swallowed. The cold, slimy beef slid down his throat and landed in his stomach with a thud. Alexander immediately fell to his knees, panting and gasping. The pain in his stomach from hunger had been replaced with a pain of fullness.¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt eat anymore.‚Äù Alexander said, the taste of raw beef still lingering on his tongue.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry.‚Äù The thing replied. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre out of time anyways.‚Äù¬†

Suddenly, Alexander collapsed to the ground. His entire body was completely numbed and limp. Alexander tried to cry out and scream, but his mouth wouldn‚Äôt respond. Alexander‚Äôs eyes remanded in one spot and spotted his arm out of the corner of his eye. Suddenly, the skin on Alexander‚Äôs arm began to split. It parted open in the middle of his forearm, his skin was being pushed open by a hotter, pinker arm underneath. Alexander braced for blood to gush out from his arm but it didn‚Äôt. The hot pink arm, which was the exact same size and shape as Alexander‚Äôs, slid out from Alexander‚Äôs skin and the rest flopping down like a rubber glove. Alexander watched, unable to move, as the pink arm bent over and neared his face. It was shiny, almost glossy, like an eel. The arm reached Alexander‚Äôs face, and two fingers and the thumb suddenly disappeared out of view. Then, Alexander‚Äôs vision split as his right eye was plucked out of the socket. Alexander‚Äôs right eye was placed a foot away, and soon his other eye joined it as they were placed in a position where Alexander could see his entire body from his view. Alexander stared in horror as the rest of his body crunched and cracked, pushed itself off the floor and stood up. Alexander‚Äôs body reached one arm and gripped at his chest and shirt. He ripped the shirt and skin off and threw it aside, revealing a hot pink chest exactly like his. Finally, the body took two hands, one still covered in skin and the other pink with skin flopping behind it, and hooked it into his empty eye sockets. He ripped Alexander‚Äôs face in half. Alexander tried to scream even though he was without a mouth, because the face he saw was vile and horrific.¬†

\*\*\*\*\*

A woman walked up to a door. The front porch was unlit, the nearest light coming from a streetlight on the sidewalk. She knocked three times on the door before calling out:¬†

‚ÄúAlex! Open up already!‚Äù

She tried looking in through the window, even though she knew she couldn‚Äôt see anything since all the lights were turned off. She pressed her ear up to the door but before she was able to hear anything, the door swung open. The woman stumbled back and looked up to find her boyfriend, Alex, was standing above her.¬†

‚ÄúAlex? Why are all the lights off?‚Äù She asked, squinting her eyes to try and see his face.

‚ÄúJessica! It‚Äôs so great to see you!‚Äù Alex replied happily. He quickly swung his arms around and gave her a hug. Jessica couldn‚Äôt help but notice that he smelled off, like a baby.¬†

‚ÄúAlex! Can you turn on the light already?‚Äù Jessica grumbled.¬†

Alex immediately reached a long arm over and flicked on the light. Alex was wearing a hoodie with the hood up, sweatpants and weird contacts. His skin was lightly pink, and Jessica wondered if he got sunburnt or something. But maybe the strangest thing he had was his smile. The Alex that Jessica remembered had a goofy, toothy grin. But for some reason Alex now had a smile that was all lips.¬†

‚ÄúOkay, can you let me in now?‚Äù Jessica said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold outside.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù Alex said.¬†

He stepped away from the entrance, turning on all the lights while making his way to the kitchen. Jessica took off her shoes and followed, noticing that the house was a bit messier than usual. Little bits of scraps were left all over, there was a large trash bag in the corner of the living room and a lot of water splattered on the kitchen floor. That strange baby smell was also lingering in the air, making Jessica feel slightly sick.¬†

‚ÄúSo, I can‚Äôt see anything going on.‚Äù Jessica commented while looking around.¬†

Alex turned around, looking into Jessica‚Äôs eyes with a strange blankness.¬†

‚ÄúYes. Today is our anniversary and I didn‚Äôt prepare anything special.‚Äù¬†

Maybe forgetting their anniversary was a forgivable offense, but bringing it up and saying that he didn‚Äôt do anything? Jessica raised her voice and was about to start yelling at Alex but stopped. He had that shit-eating grin, with nothing but lips curling to make that smile. The smile creeped Jessica off so much that she didn‚Äôt even feel like being mad at him anymore. Usually, Alex would fight back a little and they would banter and argue but make up in the end. It was their special little ‚Äòdance‚Äô and kept life exciting. But this? What was going on with him?¬†

‚ÄúOkay? Well, I did get you a gift.‚Äù Jessica said.¬†

She placed her gift bag on the dinner table. Alex lumbered over awkwardly and opened it. He looked in and took out a little round doll shaped like an egg with a flat bottom. It was painted with a yellow scarf, little eyes and a tiny smile.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Russian nesting doll.‚Äù Jessica explained. ‚ÄúI got it at an antique store. I know how much you like collecting Russian stuff so I kind of thought you‚Äôd like it.‚Äù¬†

Alex took the top half of the doll off and revealed a smaller doll inside, painted with the same eyes and smile but with a red scarf instead.¬†

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù Jessica said, eyeing Alex‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù¬†

Alex set the doll down on the dinner table and looked back into Jessica with his green contacts.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very nice. Thank you.‚Äù

Jessica was a bit taken aback. Alex was a very expressive and dramatic guy. Last year, when she got him a set of Soviet Union coke bottles, he literally jumped with joy and lifted her up with a bear hug in the air. She remembered how happy he was and how much he really showed it. So when Alex barely reacted to her gift, it made her feel awful, especially since she worked so hard to find a Russian nesting doll for him.¬†

‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù Jesscia asked, setting a hand on Alex‚Äôs shoulder.¬†

‚ÄúI am feeling great! Would you like to order some food and eat in? We can watch that show you were talking about.‚Äù Alex replied, setting his hand on her shoulder.¬†

‚ÄúAlright?‚Äù Jessica said, looking at Alex strangely.¬†

Suddenly, Alex began violently coughing into his hand. Jessica reached out to help him but Alex pushed her arms away with his other hand.¬†

‚ÄúSorry honey, I need to use the restroom real quick.‚Äù¬†

Alexander walked to the bathroom and locked the door behind him. Looking down at his hand, he saw that it was covered in blood. He turned his hand around and looked at the back. His hand had no nails, instead skin and flesh where they should‚Äôve been. Alexander looked into the mirror. His green eyes, with a hint of fog to them like an old soda bottle, were yellowing. Alexander opened his mouth and saw that the large, white teeth he wanted weren‚Äôt there. He had baby teeth instead, spread out and crooked like gravestones on a hill. Alexander reached a finger in his mouth and poked at his front incisor. It wobbled and fell out, landing on his tongue.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm falling apart.‚Äù Alexander grunted, spitting his tooth down the sink. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get enough nutrients.‚Äù¬†

Alexander took off his hood, revealing a hairless scalp. He ran two fingers above his eyelid, feeling how smooth it was lacking eyebrows. He patted his head, careful not to push his own skull in. Alexander shook his head, coughed up more blood and wiped it off on his pants.¬†

‚ÄúI need a new host.‚Äù Alexander wheezed to himself. ‚ÄúBefore I completely fall apart.‚Äù¬†

Suddenly, a knock on the bathroom door startled Alexander.¬†

‚ÄúAlex? Are you okay?‚Äù¬†

A disgusting grin spread across Alexander‚Äôs face, finally revealing his tiny teeth.¬†

Jessica stepped back as Alex opened up the bathroom door. His sweatpants had a red stain at the waist and he was finally smiling again. Except his teeth were really strange. They were tiny and spread out, reminding Jessica of a photo she saw once. It was in a nature magazine and they were doing a piece on creatures of the deep sea. There was one creature that she just really hated. It was called a goblin shark, and in Jessica‚Äôs opinion it was the ugliest, most disgusting creature she had ever seen. Goblin sharks have long snouts and wrinkled gums, both of which disgusted Jessica but the worst thing about that fish was their teeth. Sharp, tiny and spread out like the teeth of a bear trap, they looked truly *vile*. Alex‚Äôs teeth were that of a goblin shark that moment.¬†

‚ÄúAlex? What happened to your tee-‚Äù

Jessica‚Äôs voice was interrupted as Alex suddenly swooped in and kissed her. Jessica was used to being kissed by Alex, but Alex was usually gentle with his romantic displays. Now, he was being unnecessarily rough, forcing his tongue down her mouth and bending her back backwards. Alex springed off of Jessica, leaving her in a confused daze. And just as sudden as he kissed her, Alex crumpled to the floor. Jessica screamed and immediately rushed down to Alex, whose limbs were all bent in separate directions. Jessica shook him, crying and asking him what happened. But Alex didn‚Äôt say anything, instead responding by keeping both his eyes on hers, unmoving.

This was actually the first meal I ate from it for dinner the night I opened it. I had the vegetable bullion, chocolate bar, sesame sticks, chocolate cookies, dried fruit and pasta Bolognese with tofu crumbles. 

The bullion is a standard vegetable soup base that's a good alternative to the coffee or isotonic drink at night. Extra salt but better than the extra sugar? 7/10 for me. The chocolate cookies are excellent and I like them better than the vanilla ones. 10/10 for me. I love the sesame brittle and any brittle for that matter. 10/10 and mix it with the cookies and chocolate...it might blow your undies off. Speaking of the chocolate. It was a bit bloomed on the surface but otherwise fine. It's not quite as good as the French chocolate but still top tier. 9/10 for me. The dried fruit is dried fruit. Nothing more, nothing less. I wish the US would get on board and do mixed fruit instead of just cranberries. So, so many cranberries. 7/10, dried fruit gets no complaints from me. 

On to the main. This was a freeze dried main with pasta, sauce and tofu crumbles. It called for 450mL of water and that's what I put, but as you can see it was super juicy. Start with 350mL or even 300mL to get it hydrated and adjust to the thickness you like. It was almost like pasta in tomato soup at that point. It's a lot of food too once it finishes. The pasta texture was a surprise. Usually I find the pasta to be on the soft side but this was close to al dente and made this dish. The tofu crumbles and they had a meaty texture. Not much flavor but that's tofu for you. It provided the extra texture that was needed to mimic the meat sauce. Now for this sauce. I'm sorry Germany but my Granny would've been horrified by this. It really reminded me more of a chili Mac instead of pasta Bolognese. It even had a slight chili taste to it. Don't get me wrong, it didn't suck and I ate the whole bowl. It just didn't taste like Bolognese. Like I said in the beginning it was more like a tomato soup with pasta. I still give it a 7.5/10. Change it to chili Mac or change the sauce flavor to more Italian style and it would've scored higher.

Overall this is a solid menu and I give it 8.5/10.  You should get one if you can. Sig can hook you up or if you're wary of ordering from outside the US because of customs shenanigans SirG2020 is another sold seller based on the West Coast.

Not much flavor but that's tofu for you. It provided the extra texture that was needed to mimic the meat sauce. Now for this sauce. I'm sorry Germany but my Granny would've been horrified by this. It really reminded me more of a chili Mac instead of pasta Bolognese. It even had a slight chili taste to it. Don't get me wrong, it didn't suck and I ate the whole bowl. It just didn't taste like Bolognese. Like I said in the beginning it was more like a tomato soup with pasta. I still give it a 7.5/10. Change it to chili Mac or change the sauce flavor to more Italian style and it would've scored higher.

Overall this is a solid menu and I give it 8.5/10.  You should get one if you can. Sig can hook you up or if you're wary of ordering from outside the US because of customs shenanigans SirG2020 is another sold seller based on the West Coast. I've never had a customs problem with Sig as many will atest to. ",2,1758418491.0,MRE,0,1.0,False

1nmezxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID/comments/1nmezxf/suggestions_and_advice_needed/,Suggestions and advice needed!,"Hey all, 

I (27 F) have ARFID and can‚Äôt eat any fruits or vegetables. When I try, my throat closes up and I start to gag and have thrown up from it before. It‚Äôs been this way for as long as I can remember, and I grew up with parents who wrote it off as ‚Äúpickiness‚Äù and said I would grow out of it. Because of this, I have an aversion to trying things :( a huge reason is because of the texture of foods, which I know changes depending on how it‚Äôs prepared, but much of what I try comes back to a slimy texture when it‚Äôs chewed.  I think that‚Äôs the main thing that bothers me, the slimy wetness of fruits and veggies, either as is or when I chew them. I find this is mostly across the board depending on how I cook them. I do love olives (super weird one, I know) and I love roasted garlic. I can do onions if I dice them super small and cook them a lot, I love potatoes, and I can make tomato sauce from roasting tomatoes and blending them. Smoothies have averaged out to be a no-go for me, but I‚Äôm open to trying more. Seeds bother me! And I prefer salty over sweet. 

As an adult with these aversions, I find that I get A LOT of anxiety around them. Whether it‚Äôs anxiety to eat at someone‚Äôs house, go to a restaurant, anxiety telling people about my ‚Äúpickiness‚Äù or so on, it‚Äôs all so stressful. The worst, however, is I am diagnosed with OCD with my main theme being around health and disease of myself and others. As a person who has been nicotine and coffee dependent for quite some time(currently trying to ease up), and who takes prescribed stimulants, my eating habits make me worry so so so much about my health and specifically my heart health. There are days I convince myself I am having a heart attack or I will have one and I think a lot of these fears/anxieties come back to ARFID and my inability to eat healthy. 

I am looking for any advice or suggestions to broadening my ability to consume fruits and veggies because I do worry about my health from not getting enough nutrients. Any suggestions would be appreciated! I currently don‚Äôt have access to a therapist, and when I have I didn‚Äôt find much support in this area.

Not a massive redditor by any means and usually use it to chat to people about specific shows and movies (as a cinephile and TV series-phile I have surprisingly few real life friends who are the same. 

And for some reason this morning while I'm waiting for my gut to do its thing so I can get on with the day, I thought I'd search for IBS on reddit and found this sub.

Hx: Growing up I had iron guts. Eat anything anytime anywhere and not a problem. Then at around 24 years old the IBS-D started. Now 46 so have been living with this for 22 years. 

Triggers: Fructose and Stress main ones. I can drink milk but do take lactose enzyme tablets as a just in case. Imodium had become my best friend but take way too much of it. I was using this herbal supplement called Iberogast but some of the herbs started playing havoc with my liver enzymes so had to stop still use it occasionally.

Am seeing a therapist to deal with the stress but it's hard to be stress free when I have an hour commute to work every morning and I don't usually do anything until I've had at least 1 bm. Fortunately I own my own business so theoretically I can be a bit late, unfortunately my business partners don't understand and think that I'm just exaggerating the problem to slack off. Unfortunately one of my business partners that I have known for close to 30 years and I considered my best friend - my lateness and the toll this condition has taken on me has stuffed our friendship. My other business partners also have the luxury of not having to worry about living your life about where the nearest toilet is nor do they get it.

My wife understands but even she gets a bit sick of my 30+ min toilet visits. I don't particularly like them either. She also hates that we can't go for a walk together in the morning because I'm just too scared to go unless I get caught short. Yes there are public toilets on our walk but an attack can come on so suddenly I may not get there in time. 

My car has a bag in it with toilet roll, a spare pair of underpants and wet wipes. Even still I'd rather go to a toilet than squat on the side of the freeway. I've had a few close calls over the years. There's been several times on the freeway I've driven at stupidly illegal speeds to get to a toilet either at work or a McDonald's before I've shat myself. 

To say that my quality if life for the last 22 years has been crap (no pun intended) is an understatement. People just don't get it unless they also live it. Just seems a lot of people in my life don't have this issue so they just don't understand.

I'm trying to loose weight as the constant stress of my job and the IBS has made me put on considerable weight. I'm currently 20kg over what I should be. I have a supportive group of school dad's who always try and encourage me to go riding with them. I love riding my bike. What I don't like is taking off all the paraphernalia that comes with riding a road bike to get to the toilet in time. 

If I know that I have to be somewhere the next day, I essentially starve myself or what I do eat is to bind myself up. Of course that means bloating and pain, but I'll take that over shitting myself or running looking for a toilet. This is also what I do when I am lucky enough to get time to play a round of golf. Don't eat and eat a handful of Imodium and hope for the best. Of course not eating and not having a coffee just leads to a shocking headache so the day usually turns out to be a bust. Same as if I need to be at work to open (I am a pharmacist - and weekends I have to be at work on time - so day starts very early for me as that commute is an hour regardless of it being school traffic or a weekend)

I've been to many doctors and had several scopes and none have been conclusive for anything other than IBS. However I did read a post up here about using IBD medication because there is Micro flare ups of IBD that may not be detected with a scope. So will 
get a script for some low dose mesalazine and see how that goes.

I also find that my condition is bad here in Australia (home). We visit Greece every year for holidays and my bowel is almost perfect for the weeks we are there. I can even eat trigger foods and I'm fine - so the stress is a major trigger for me and potentially any additives or herbicides they add to the food in Australia.

Anyway that's my story. Will prob spend most of the day reading everyone else's as I know that a lot of people suffer from this but I seem to have a lack of people in my real life circle that do so feel extremely lonely and isolated because of this, which then makes me sad which then triggers anxiety and the whole vicious circle goes round and round",1,1758417299.0,ibs,2,1.0,False

No fear, no emotion, no thought. The heat on my face as it all went up in flames comforted me. No more life as I knew it, no more work, no more employees, just flames and the heat on my face. Atomic bomb. Nuclear explosion, night sky turned to day in an instant. I was miles away from home and miles away in my mind. I could hear screaming, I could hear pain and agony. I didn‚Äôt care, the warmth on my skin felt like a mother‚Äôs hug. A day like today will be remembered forever, and I‚Äôll be forever grateful that I saw it with my own eyes. A day like any other. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Coffee, news, work, chat, listen, listen, listen, death in the form of a paycheck. A day like any other. It wasn‚Äôt a surprise to me, honestly, even I wanted to nuke this place from time to time, but the timing was immaculate. I had just spit in my ungrateful bosses face. I had just finally allowed myself the courage to tell him what I thought of him. Boom. The ground shook and a light brighter than heaven itself ripped apart the sky. Freedom rang. I answered. 
My name doesn‚Äôt matter. When this started I was a lonesome man, I had nothing and no one. I was controlled by what I was told controlled me. Work. Sex. Drink. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Money. Money. Money. Work. Drink. Sex. Meaningless. Wake up. Do it again. Media had been consumed with greed, only telling the story as it fit the narrative of the highest bidder. We knew that, I think. I knew that? But I listened anyway. Hate the blacks. Hate the whites. Hate the tans. Hate your neighbor. Listen to us, we tell the truth. Your low wages are because of immigration. You‚Äôre in a downward spiral because your neighbor voted against you. Hate him. Hate him. Love us. Listen we tell the truth. 
I was fed up. I had enough. I was ready to quit my job and leave it all behind, move to an empty state. Somewhere people didn‚Äôt want to go because it wasn‚Äôt comfortable. Boom. The ground shook and I could see the fear in my bosses eyes. I hated him so much I reveled in the moment. I didn‚Äôt care if the flames licked my skin to bones, I had made my peace with it. Before this moment I knew it would never be the same and I was happy for the first time in my miserable life. 
When I woke, ash was falling from the sky. I couldn‚Äôt understand what had actually happened. Not fully. Not partially. I was lost, burried underneath the place I had sworn to leave, wake up. Wake up. Wake up. My lungs burned from the smoke I had inhaled, my body burned from the light that I had been exposed to, life had ended. Life as I knew it anyhow, and now I was crawling from the aftermath. Like a snake shedding its skin, like a flower emerging from the ground. I was changed. Fundamentally my world was turned on its head. This wasn‚Äôt my plan, this wasn‚Äôt what I had imagined quitting my job would feel like, but here I was. Caught in the tide and I was sick of drowning. 
Days after the initial blasts most of my country was in shock. Nobody knew the truth. The news that got through was saying it was another country, but the people who were part of our government revolted saying it was brought on by our own people. The people in charge of keeping us safe. It was a culling. 
I wasn‚Äôt built for war. I wasn‚Äôt built for conflict, I learned this very quickly. But I also learned how easy it is for another man to put himself first. Above all. Self righteous murder. When I saw first hand what a man could do to another man, it changed me. Made me accept my new reality. Kill. Kill. Kill. Wake up. Kill. Or be devoured. Devoured by your neighbor. Hate him. Hate the blacks. Hate the whites. They caused this. Your neighbor. Kill. Kill. Kill. 
Murder was easy, a trigger. A slight pull of the finger. A good aim. At a distance it wasn‚Äôt personal, just business. Take theirs, add to your own. Worm your way through the undergrowth. Kill. Kill. Kill. Hide. Kill again. Again. Better. Accurate. Then the bullets ran out. Then the people alive wanted ‚Äúpeace‚Äù. No more. No war. Please speak. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. We share. We love you. We care. Listen to us. We tell the truth. 
It only brought the worst of us. The rapists. The predators. The ones who didn‚Äôt have a soul before the blasts. So I persisted. I crafted. I built. I alone murdered for my own gain. 
I am not a good man. I am not just. I am a product of my environment and I prevail. I hunt. I kill. I take. I am what inherits this rubble. In my own words, I was expecting to leave a world behind for something unknown. For something new, and untouched. But now. Now everything was touched. Everything bore the scars of human ignorance. Crops didn‚Äôt grow, sunlight was a myth. Humans had returned to the animals that we knew we were. And I was exceptional. I took. I killed. I added to my own. I prevailed. 
I had never been an athlete, nor was I traditionally smart. I learned from trial and error, I learned from others mistakes. I didn‚Äôt have friends, neither did I care to make them. Another mouth to feed? Seriously? Fuck that. I killed. I murdered. I pillaged. I stole. I am not a good man. I hated my neighbor. I wanted him to suffer so I could enjoy a full stomach. 
I am a product of my environment, wake up. Wake up. Wake up. I kill. I murder. I hate my neighbor. 

Years passed, the light in people‚Äôs eyes dimmed. We tried to form communities, but we couldn‚Äôt overcome our hunger for excess. Our countries government tried to step in soon after the explosions, they tried to remind us of our ‚Äúhumble‚Äù beginnings. But it all turned to anger, anger that it had gotten so bad. Rage that it had gotten to the point where they deemed a culling inevitable. They rallied troops against us.  Tried to bring order from the orchestrated chaos they created. It only made us more angry. More hungry. More determined. I told you about my beginning. Now I‚Äôll tell you what changed. What brought me to the revolution. The voice.  Wake up. Wake up. Kill. Again. 
It was early October, I was traveling between colonies when I heard a sound from beyond the wood line. HELP. HELP ME PLEASE. MY DAUGHTER! PLEASE GOD HELP! 
Usually I ignored cries, I‚Äôd heard them all before. The begging. The shot. The silence. But this time it was different. I don‚Äôt know how but it touched me somewhere beyond my flesh. A man screaming out in fear was one thing, a woman screaming out in desperation had a certain quality to it that could move the most hardened of us. 
So I turned and began to walk silently into the snow. I listened. I stalked. I was silent. 
HELP GOD PLEASE, MY BABY! MY BABY! GOD PLEASE HELP!
The screams echoed through the pine in such a manner it made my hair stand up. I am not a good man.  I am not just. But what I heard made me bolt into the woods like a wolf after a rabbit. If this was a trick, it was a damn good one. 
In a clearing just beyond the trees I saw a woman doubled over what looked like a balled up quilt, just behind her was a small group of teenagers smiling like they had just taken down a bull elk. 
I squatted behind a bush and waited. My gun at the ready and my breath under control. 
‚ÄúHahaha good shot Jacob, she was running full sprint and you folded her!‚Äù
The teens were reveling in their kill. 
‚ÄúThis bitch should have stopped when you hollered Jacob. I don‚Äôt blame you for shooting her. She deserved it!‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah bro, you really have gotten good with your dad‚Äôs bow.‚Äù 
‚ÄúHa! Jacob! She‚Äôs got a kid! You got two for one!‚Äù
My safety clicked off as I watched through my scope. I don‚Äôt know why I felt inclined to shoot but something about this situation had my blood boiling. 
A woman. Alone. Teenagers acting out. They probably weren‚Äôt even alive before the bombs. 
God my head is throbbing in anger. Why?
Why do I care? I don‚Äôt know her? 
She could be a thief. She could be a killer. 
These kids could have done us all a favor but I was on fire. I couldn‚Äôt stand it. 
Boom. Recoil. Click. 
Boom. Recoil. Click.
Boom. Recoil. Click.
I‚Äôm not a good man. Nor do I care to be one. 
But I am not a monster. 

The wind was exceptionally cold, the snow was stained red and the lines I had just drawn were not visible to human eyes. 
I watched the wood line to make sure no one else was coming. No one else was around. 
After I was satisfied I walked up to the three teenagers that laid on the ground. Two of them were dead. Eyes wide open, staring into the sky for whatever God they prayed to. 
I could hear gurgling. Whining. Coughing. Jacob, the leader of the party was barely alive. Scared as he was he looked at me and begged me to save him. I just stared as he drowned in his own blood. Some how, I knew he deserved it. 
The woman that was the cause of this disturbance was doubled over with three arrows sticking out of her back. Under her was a quilt, folded neatly. Wrapped around a child. 
I am not a good man. I am not just. I do not care for others. But. But. But. This child, this kid looked at me. This child crawled out from under her mother and hugged me. Wake up. Wake up. Please woman. Wake up. Wake up. 
I can‚Äôt raise this kid. I can‚Äôt keep this child safe. Her own mother couldn‚Äôt. Didn‚Äôt. Fuck. 
I smiled at this child while I raised my rifle. I am not a good man. Not a good man. Not good. A man. Click. 
Click. 
Click. 
Click. 
My rifle was empty. God. My rifle is empty. 
Click. 
Click. 
Please. 
Click. 
She giggled. 
I was trying to kill a baby. God. 
I am not a man at all. 

The snow cracked under my feet as I carried this little girl away from her dead mother. I was three miles from the nearest colony and I was certain someone there was more qualified to take care of her than I was. 
She wasn‚Äôt scared of me. She clung to me. I had forgotten what a humans touch even felt like. Of course every now and then a fight had gotten too close and I got decked in the mouth or grabbed by the throat, but this. This was different. This was trust. Trust. Trust. Trust. 
I couldn‚Äôt do this. I tried to kill her, of course in my mind it was justified. She was about to die anyway? Right? Why did I care what happened to her? Why did I give a shit if another child died alone in the woods? As we got closer to the colony I had to keep shifting which arm I was carrying her in, and that‚Äôs when I heard it. 
A crinkling of paper. 
Paper? 
I sat the kid down on the ground and reached into her pocket, where I found a note written on paper. 
‚ÄúTo whoever finds my daughter,
Please please take the time to read this. 
I have been trying to reach the colony in the Wyoming territory, if you find this it means I wasn‚Äôt successful. I only pray my daughter is still alive. 
Her aunt lives in the colony near big river, my daughter is deaf so please understand if she doesn‚Äôt react to your words. 
God bless you, whoever reads this. Please keep my Effie alive. Please.‚Äù 
I am not a good man. I am not just. I take. I kill. I murder. 
I did not ask for this, but yet I feel compelled to see it through. 
As we neared the colony, I could hear yelling. I could see smoke and hear the sounds of gunfire and explosions. 
It was unusual considering guns had almost become obsolete, no one had ammunition anymore and the few of us that knew how to reload were often kidnapped and forced into labor by colonies. 
I only ever reloaded my own and when asked I always answered with a volley of fire. I am not a good man. 
Effie couldn‚Äôt hear the blasts so she was content on my shoulder. And toward hell we marched. ",2,1758417123.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

1nmetzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/LOTR_on_Prime/comments/1nmetzn/end_credit_song_ranking_from_worst_to_best/,End credit song ranking. From worst to best. (Strictly in my opinion!),"So a while back, I made a list that was consisting of the many end credit songs throughout different forms of media of Middle-earth. I decided to make an updated list, this time with newer additions. Even spanning from a video game inspired by Tolkien lore. Now, chances are there is a song that I am missing. But I believe that I have listened to and ranked all of the ending songs that stick out the most. Also, the list consists of songs with lyrics, so instrumentals do not count. Also, I can‚Äôt stretch this enough. Allow me to place this crucial bit in all caps. Hopefully to ensure that there are no other loose ends to tie. Anyways, as said in the title, this order in which these songs stand in, ARE JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION! Odds are, there is a song on my list that‚Äôs your favorite or least favorite. So fill free to let me know, but please be civil about it. I don‚Äôt want to start any arguments, or step on too many toes as I already am. Another thing, the songs throughout are from three different forms of media. Films, video games, and TV. Yeah. I know, it‚Äôs taboo to talk about ‚Äúyou know what,‚Äù but when we get there, just hear me out. This list will also be going from worst to best. Again, in terms of preference. So, here we go. Oh! Before I forget! Another note, I do know that there are many writers who had a hand with the song. I‚Äôm merely focusing on the artists who sing them, but I will bring up the writers in most if not all of the entries. Alright, with that addressed, let‚Äôs begin. 


12. The Ballad of Damrod: by Jens Kidman. Now, if there is one thing that Ring of Power does right, from the very start, it‚Äôs the music. Bear McCreary has a very vast grasp on what makes great Middle-earth music. Doesn‚Äôt help that prior to his inclusion, he was also the composer of both the new God of War games. Not to mention we get the legendary Howard Shore to compose the opening theme. I tend to listen to the soundtracks often when I am just sitting at home relaxing, or doing other activities like cleaning the house. Obviously, I listen more of Howard Shore‚Äôs masterpieces from all six films, but Bear is among the library as well. Unfortunately not all of Bear‚Äôs works are a hit. 
I‚Äôve talked about this one in the past, that while I do like the music itself, I can‚Äôt say for the vocals. I love some rock, I can even like heavy rock. But not when the singer sounds like he is getting over a sickness! The singer sounds like he has throat cancer or something! When a rock song does that type of vocalization, I check out. It‚Äôs fine if it‚Äôs done for a little while, just not the whole thing. Which is a shame, because the song starts out really well, and seeing as Professor Tolkien has been a huge inspiration for rock and roll as a whole, you‚Äôd think doing a rock song featuring Middle-earth would be genius! Which it is, but what matters is the execution. For me, the execution just isn‚Äôt there. 

11. Gollum‚Äôs Song: by Emiliana Torrini. Oh boy. I just know I‚Äôm pissing someone off. But truth be told, out of the 6 live action films, this was always my least favorite. I don‚Äôt know why. I mean, the orchestral score by Howard is chilling, beautiful even. The vocals of Torrini are haunting, and hypnotic even. Fran Walsh does a fantastic job in writing the song, but for some reason, this is the one I listen to the least; film credit songs that is. I‚Äôve spent years wondering why that was, and I still don‚Äôt have a definitive answer to that! Maybe because when I first heard the song, I watched the music video, and remembered being confused on what the song was about. Yeah. Imagine, but I was like seven, so cut me some slack. Also the fact that I would constantly listen to the number one song many times(no spoilers just yet,) Gollum‚Äôs Song just felt inferior in comparison. But, I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get the definitive answer to this, and maybe, it‚Äôs best if I didn‚Äôt. Keep in mind, I‚Äôm not saying that this is a bad song! Far from it! But compared to the other five songs from the saga, this one just isn‚Äôt my cup of tea. 

10. Fires of War: by Kelli Schaefer. The newest placement in my list, and it comes from the sequel to one of my all-time favorite games. Shadow of War was, and still is, a very odd game for me. Like, it does a lot of questionable stuff when it comes to the writing and the lore, sexy Shelob is the prime example of that. As someone who played through and adores Shadow of Mordor, I will say that I was disappointed that that game didn‚Äôt have a credit song, that wasn‚Äôt mainly orchestral. But after playing through Shadow of War, when I heard the ending song, I was both amazed, and glad that the minor nitpick was fixed. Now, truth be told, I haven‚Äôt listened to it that much, heck, Gollum‚Äôs Song got more plays. But I have to say, out of the two, though despite not listening to as often as the other songs, it just fits more at home with me. Maybe because it‚Äôs my love for the first game, and my satisfaction of finishing the second one, completing Talion‚Äôs story, maybe it‚Äôs the vocals of Kelli, or the lyrics and music written and composed by Nathan Grigg. I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it. If I were to give an answer, it would be a mix of both. As said, I love the first game to death, even though like any game, there are admittedly parts that piss me off,(not as much as Shadow of War though,) so hearing the lyrics with the score that reflect the struggles of Talion just resonated with me more. 

9. I See Fire: by Ed Sheeran.
I love Ed Sheeran. The very first song recall hearing of him was I See Fire. That very first time came from that fateful Christmas Day when I went to see The Desolation of Smaug with my Dad as a present. Got the tickets in a Gandalf bookmark too! Needless to say, that was a great Christmas for me! So when the credits started rolling and the song played, I wanted to listen to the whole thing, but my Dad just wanted to go home. So I went home and listened to it on YouTube. Since then, it is a go-to song for me whenever I am out and about. With that said, I See Fire kind of sticks out. What I mean is that the other songs have a certain feel to them, like they‚Äôre in a uniform which reflects that they are songs meant to represent the Tolkien universe, while Ed‚Äôs still does this just fine, I feel it does it less than the others. Even Gollum‚Äôs Song did that better, admittedly. But then again, maybe that‚Äôs why I like it so much. Because it sticks out. Regardless, it helped introduce me to a man with great talent, and I honestly, wouldn‚Äôt change that for the all the gold in the world. 

8. This Wandering Day: by Janet Roddick. Now, I wasn‚Äôt going to include this in my list, as it was featured in the Rings of Power episode, Partings. As Poppy would sing it throughout the Journey. But that changed when a user showed me that another singer had sang it during the end credits. Obviously the singer was better in the end, but Poppy‚Äôs actress(whose name escapes me,) did fine for what she was given. Oddly, this was one of the few times in Season One where it felt like it was a proper welcome back to Middle-earth. What makes it even more shocking was that it was written by J.D. Payne, one of the showrunners. One of the few times that Tolkien had a small chance shined through in his writing, and, he actually did a decent job. While not perfect, I do find myself listening to either version. Even more so with the cover by Colm McGuiness, and his duet with Jax the Bard. That one I have listened to many times over. They have such great voices, and I highly recommend that you give it a listen to. But with that said, This Wandering Day, a shining moment from a Tolkien adaptation that‚Ä¶well, is incredibly flawed. To put it in the nicest way I can. I know a lot of people here hate it, but personally, I just find it, meh. But even so, I still choose to just listen to the soundtracks. Those will always be a treat to me. Still, not near the majesty of Howard, but still good. 

7. The Rider: by Paris Paloma.
This one I have been wanting to listen to for a while. Finally got around to last week. When I was sitting down at my local bookstore, and just enjoying my day. Writing down notes, and taking in the atmosphere. There‚Äôs a little space you can sit in and rest by a fake fireplace, while reading a book, or just drinking some coffee. Anyway, I‚Äôm getting off track. I saw that the Rider was on the list on YouTube, and since I have been looking to listen to it, basically since War of the Rohirrim came out, I decided to give it a go. I‚Äôm very glad I did. The vocals of Paris really do feel as though one of Rohan was singing. The music itself is nice. As all Middle-earth music would naturally be. Phoebe Gittins and David Long did a good job as writers for the song. The only real thing is that holds it back for me, is that I really need to listen to it more for it to really stick with me. Also doesn‚Äôt help that I still need to watch the film, which I look to fix this coming Tolkien week. So maybe in the future, this song will reach higher onto my list. But will it reach the top five? Personally no. Because I love those songs way more, as they hold deeper to me, not to mention that the very four in question have remained firm in their place for years. Frankly, I don‚Äôt think that will chance. Number 5, well, time will have to be the judge. 

6. Where The Shadows Lie: by Fiona Apple. 
You know, when I first watched Season one of ROP, I kept saying to myself after like the first episode, ‚ÄúThis is supposed to be a Lord of the Rings show, right?‚Äù All I was getting was that it was trying to be‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶whatever it was trying to be. Wheels of Time? Maybe the Witcher? I don‚Äôt know. But aside from a few moments where it did shine through that this was meant to be an adaptation of Tolkien‚Äôs work, I felt lost many other times. But as soon as the last episode played, and Sauron returns to Mordor, and the Three Rings are made, the credits roll, and then it starts to feel like Lord of the Rings! All thanks to the ending song, sung by Fiona Apple. Who did a nice rendition of the One Ring Poem. I can‚Äôt complain about the lyrics of the song, because it‚Äôs word from word the poem written by Professor Tolkien! So the lyrics are solid. The music, once more by Bear, is chilling, foreboding, and a signal for the worst events in the Second Age are about to begin. Fiona brings a performance that is decently reflecting that. Once again, the music comes to the rescue for the show, this time, Tolkien‚Äôs lyrics are a skeletal structure. 

5. Old Tom Bombadil: by Rufus Wainwright.
Season two, was definitely an improvement over Season 1. My Dad and I watched it when it came out and we both found it to be more enjoyable; as it felt more like Lord of the Rings, compared to whatever Season 1 was trying to be. I feel that it was really a case of missing identity. While the identity for season isn‚Äôt all there, I can at least say that it was a more fitting welcome back to Middle-earth. Although, it was still riddled with issues. Some I‚Äôd rather NOT talk about, due to disgust, and stupidity. If you know, you know. But I digress, the first thing I did in preparation to Season two was listen to the music. When I heard that Tom Bombadil was finally getting adapted in another form that wasn‚Äôt a video game, and after over twenty years of images of what could have been in the Peter Jackson films, I was intrigued. Not excited, or angry, just intrigued. Then I looked up Tom Bombadil online to see if any new information was out, and I saw the song on YouTube. I clicked on it, and learned that singer Rufus Wainwright was singing it. I must admit, he was an actual good fit to sing a song written by Tolkien. Though the lyrics were combined from other songs that Tom sung in the books, I didn‚Äôt mind. Because I just loved hearing Rufus‚Äô voice, and to hear more of Tolkien‚Äôs lyrics sung, was always a treat. I have to say, out of all of the songs that ROP released with lyrics, Old Tom Bombadil is the one I visit the most. Because I just love the lyrics, because of course, the music, once more by McCreary who just kills it, and Wainwright‚Äôs singing, as I used to love Hallelujah as a kid. So yeah. This is the ROP song I‚Äôve heard the most, and in my opinion, the best of the four. 

4. Song of the Lonely Mountain(film version): by Neil Finn. 
It was in April of 2013, it was a rainy day, and both me and my Dad were at home. He comes to my room and asks me if I wanted to rent a movie from Redbox, so we go to Wal-Mart, and we find that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was available to rent. We missed out on seeing it that previous year, so I immediately jumped at the chance to rent it. In the end, my dad and I watched it twice that night. A wonderful welcome back to the land of Middle-earth. Not to mention, this was officially where I wanted to read the books. I found a copy of The Hobbit at a further Wal-Mart, bought it, and I was hooked. As of today, The Hobbit is the only novel I have ever read twice! That is another reason why I hold An Unexpected Journey close to my heart. It was a mix of fond memories of my past, making new ones with my father, and it helped me become a bigger fan of Professor Tolkien‚Äôs mythology. It also inspired me to create my own fantasy worlds. But that‚Äôs a topic for another day. Back to the song. I actually heard it through when I watched the film with my granny one day when I went to spend the day with her. Long story. So as the credits rolled, I sat in silence, and listened to the song. Since then, Song of the Lonely Mountain became the end credit song of Middle-earth that has been replayed on my music lists for years. Second to only my number one favorite. I love Neil‚Äôs vocals, the background vocals, which I‚Äôve heard were done by his sons,(which makes it even better in my opinion)the music once more done by Howard Shore, the fact that it matches the same melody as Misty Mountains Cold in the film(one of my favorite parts by the way,)and the lyrics. Now, I mainly speak of the film version.‚Äôfor the soundtrack has this echo when Neil sings, and it doesn‚Äôt have that orchestral beginning like in the credits. I don‚Äôt think have much to complain about aside from the difference in versions. Nothing more to say, just that I adore the song, but I love the top three just a bit more. But hey! Still the second most listened song of the list. That‚Äôs still something to be proud of. 

3. Into The West: by Annie Lennox. 
Ah. Annie Lennox. I adore her voice. From Sweet Dreams, Here Comes the Rain Again, and Love Song for a Vampire. She has such an amazing talent, and is on my list as being one of my favorite singers. When I learned that it was she who sung Into The West, I have to be honest, being a kid, I never put it together. But as I got older, and learned it was her, I listened to the song once more, like actually listened to it, and like her other works of art, I was enchanted. There is no wonder as to why this song one the Oscar for best song back in 2004. All in thanks to the writing talent of Annie, and the lovely Fran Walsh, as well as the music composed by Howard. Used throughout sections of such a masterpiece of cinema, yes. Now, while not my number one favorite song, I still love it, and personally, it was really close for the last three. For Annie, I was just listening to it over and over last week. I don‚Äôt think I have anything bad to say about the song. It‚Äôs a masterpiece, through and through. 

2. The Last Goodbye: by Billy Boyd. 
It‚Äôs Billy Boyd! Pippin, who sings the song to close out the saga! Like, come on! Billy has already shown he has a great voice in Return of the King, so of course it only made sense to give him a full length song! It also helps that he helped Fran and Philippa write it! I had to stop myself from leaving the theater when my Dad and I went to see The Battle of the Five Armies that very year. It was going to be another Christmas present, but neither Mom and Dad knew if they would be able to get tickets for Christmas Day. But when I was watching the credits, and I heard the song, I literally murmured to myself, ‚ÄúPippin.‚Äù Of course the thought was correct as moments later after the cast was shown, it showed that Billy Boyd was indeed singing. As I went home, I went to YouTube, found the music video, and was in tears, not only did it have Billy singing like an angel once more, but the video played clips from all six of the films. Locations, characters, behind the scenes moments from the crew, and when it ended with Billy singing, ‚ÄúI bid you all, a very fond farewell,‚Äù no lie, I teared up. To so many, like myself, this felt like it was indeed the last goodbye, and we could close that very chapter in our lives. Seems silly to think of it like this now, but back then, this truly felt like the very end of Middle-earth. So for the past two years, as I would allow the end credit songs to play, I also like to add The Last Goodbye music video to my watch list, as a way to say goodbye to Middle-earth, until next time. To me, it just makes my marathon a little more special, and I intend to do so again this year! Oh, I can‚Äôt wait! Tolkien week Can‚Äôt get there sooner!! 

1. May It Be: by Enya. 
The gold standard to what songs of Middle-earth should be. Or at least in my honest to Eru opinion. Let me go back to the past, and unlock a memory of my childhood. When I was a kid, wee boy, my older sister and I were talking to ourselves after watching the Lord of the stings for what felt like the thousandth time. So, we decide rondo something different. We went to the second disc of the Fellowship of the Ring DVD, and found the bonus features, we found the music video of May It Be, I was immediately in love with such a magical song. From the lyrics, the melody, and of course Enya‚Äôs unworldly voice which lifted my very spirit. Which for a six year old child, this was rare. Out of all the credit songs, this is the one I listened to the most, the one that captured my heart, and became what I feel all of the songs should strive to be. It just clicks all of the boxes for me. Not to mention the fact that I believe this is where my love for Celtic and New-Age singers began to blossom. But I digress. Beautifully written by Enya herself, with additional aid from Roma Ryan to boot! Like Into the West, this song is just flawless, at least in my opinion. It‚Äôs a freaking masterpiece and it really should have won the Oscar as well. Randy Newman, nothing personal, but If I didn‚Äôt Have You was no where near an Oscar worthy song in comparison to May It Be. But I digress, another thing I used to do is listen to it before I went to sleep when I uploaded it to my mp3 player, many years later. It is such a soothing piece that can make anyone dream such wonderful things. It also soothes my anger whenever something gets me riled. Like, I swear they use this song in therapy sessions. Another thing that makes this song so great, is that it has great covers. One specifically is an acapella piece performed by Peter Hollens, with the addition violin by Taylor Davis. If I‚Äôm not listening to Enya‚Äôs rendition, the Peter is there is enchanting me with his own great talent. I highly recommend you check that cover out if you haven‚Äôt already. It‚Äôs a masterpiece in its own right. Especially at the second chorus. That is my favorite part of that performance. Another thing I nearly forgot to add was complementing Nick Ryan for composing the song, and of course, our dear Howard Shore for conducting it with the London Philharmonic Orchestra of all things. That is truly the cherry on top of such a beautiful cake that shall live on for years to come. 

So, there we have it! All of the Middle-earth related credit songs from worst to best, in my opinion. What are your favorite or least favorite songs? Let me know, and remember, this is just my personal opinion. So please do not take any of this post to heart. I merely wanted to share another thing I love about the world of Tolkien. Also, if you do decide to reply, please don‚Äôt be a jerk about it. I just want to have a nice conversation free from any drama and chaos. With that said, comment below, and let me know.

1nmesmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1nmesmv/memory_loss/,Memory loss,"Hello. Kind of an odd story that happened to me this evening, wanted some input. I‚Äôm a 28 y/o female with hashimotos/hypothyroidism, I take 50 mcg of levothyroxine daily. I just had my labs done and my T4&t3 are normal and my TSH is normal 1.6. Here‚Äôs the story‚Ä¶ 
Sitting at the park with my husband and kids. Talking about buying a home, then brought up all of the houses we lived in, then all of a sudden I literally forgot where we lived. I could not remember our address or the location of our current home we have lived at for 2 years. I went into panic mode bc I could not for the life of me remember. It was the weirdest thing. It felt like out of body. Everything was fine then boom, I forgot my address and my home. It came back to me after about 60 seconds. I think I freaked my husband out cause I told him ‚ÄúI literally don‚Äôt know where we live. I cannot remember‚Äù. It was more than a brain fog thing I feel like. It was odd. I‚Äôve never forgotten where I live before? 
Anyway, I read it could be because I did have a cup of coffee basically on an empty stomach 4ish hours before. Something to do with my adrenaline, then my brain crashing and just not working? 
I don‚Äôt know. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. It freaked me out. anything similar ever happened to any of you?",1,1758416734.0,Hashimotos,5,0.99,False
1nmes5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipproblems/comments/1nmes5m/am_i_being_unrealistic_or_should_i_move_on/,Am I being unrealistic or should I move on?,"Hi yall, hoping to get some perspectives here, mainly guys cause im trying to understand and because I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm being unreasonable, or if my experience is common.

I (F25) and my partner (M30) have been together for about 4 years. In the beginning, everything was great, felt like the stars aligned. We connected instantly, had a long honeymoon phase (over a year), and were just so into each other.

Things started changing around 2.5 years in. The first big argument was about him not helping around his place (setting the table, cleaning, dishes, etc.). I told him I couldn‚Äôt be with someone who didn‚Äôt pull their weight/was comfortable with being a slob, especially since he talked about us moving in together. At first, he got offended, but eventually he did make more of an effort.

But over time I started noticing a big effort imbalance. At the start, we would both surprise each other with little things (coffee, dinners, trying new places) and try to have new experiences together. Later, I realized I was the only one still doing it. I was a full-time student working two part-time jobs, and he worked long hours too I still made the effort/time to plan dates, spend time thinking of the perfect/meaningful gifts, and come up with ways to spend quality time. Meanwhile, he would often blame it on just being ‚Äútoo tired‚Äù or ‚Äútoo busy.‚Äù

Some examples: I planned all our birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays. If I didn‚Äôt, nothing would happen.

I surprised him with gifts, food, little notes, flowers, and even big gestures like decorating his car for his birthday ‚Äî he‚Äôd just give me a quick ‚Äúthanks‚Äù say he liked it and move on.

He rarely planned dates or tried new activities with me. Saturdays he'd be up and at wrestling practice from 9-12, then workout more at home, so realistically he wouldn't be ready until around 4 or 5pm (and I mean this was every Saturday, like it was a routine and rarely moved it around). If I suggested things like a farmers market or morning hike, going to the gym together he never made the effort.

We'd get intimate only around 2-3 times a month.

Communication also dropped off. He‚Äôd text me in the morning, then I often wouldn‚Äôt hear from him until late evening. I felt like I was waiting all day just to hear from him. 

What hurt the most was feeling like he didn‚Äôt prioritize me. For example, I‚Äôd asked him for years to take me dancing/club at least once in a while (I love to dance), but he never did. After about 4 years of asking him to go it wasn‚Äôt because of me ‚Äî it was for his friend‚Äôs birthday. I got really annoyed that when I asked every time for him to accompany me, there was an excuse but for his friend, he was able to rearrange his training/time to go and stay out late. 

Over the last year especially, I felt more like I was single than in a relationship. I wanted the kind of effort I gave ‚Äî not constantly, but at least sometimes. A thoughtful note, flowers ‚Äújust because,‚Äù planning a date where all I had to do was show up, or dressing up for me once in a while, when I get dressed up I'd like something more than ""pretty"" (never called me beautiful), he never took pictures of me/us, but I was always taking pictures of him/us. I don't think he started opening the car door for me until around 3 and a half years in, again only cause I asked him to/said I'd appreciate if he did that. I even made an effort to learn his language and asked if he can at least make a small effort to start learning mine. 

The final straw was realizing that if he couldn‚Äôt show up for me now, how would he show up in a marriage, or when kids were involved? I expressed that I don't want to be in a marriage like our parents where our moms have to buy themselves flowers on mothers day, or have to hold out on attending concerts or going out to a fancy dinner because their husbands don't feel like it/say they have too much work. I also said that I would want the father of my kids to be involved in their lives and make time for them, but how can I expect that for him if he's not even doing that for me. I encouraged him to find a better work-life balance, but he'd just say ""yea I know"" and things wouldn't really change. It felt like life was passing us by, and I was the only one trying to make it meaningful.

I feel like Im the one constantly carrying the bigger effort load, I know relationships aren't supposed to be 50/50 all the time, but it's been like this for a while now, it's tiring where even my guy/girl friends joke saying that I'm the boyfriend & the girlfriend. I won't accept his excuse that he's not ""good at relationships"" cause during the first 2 years, the effort, care and thoughtfulness was there. 

So here‚Äôs my question for the guys here:

Is this kind of withdrawal/low effort normal in long-term relationships? Do men just naturally ‚Äúsettle in‚Äù and stop doing the little things? I'll be honest and say maybe this is where my unrealistic expectations come from, but i kinda thought when a guy loves his girlfriend, yk these things come kinda natural because you have this want to do it for them/make them feel special...I understand maybe lack of relationship experience may play a part, but with the right person, it sort of ""clicks"" in a sense and/or they brings this loving behavior out of you. I've brought this up to him multiple times, about every 4-6 months for 2 years but recently since this February and that friends bday party, I starting to think i need to move on since when he does ""change"" it only lasts for 2 weeks and back to the same cycle. 

If your partners voiced concerns like this, what would y'all/did y'all do to improve?

(I‚Äôd also appreciate any perspective on whether I was asking for too much. Am I being unrealistic in wanting these certain actions/efforts, or is it fair to expect some reciprocity?)",2,1758416692.0,relationshipproblems,1,1.0,False
1nmerqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1nmerqq/tifu_by_not_remembering_what_its_like_to_be_a_kid/,TIFU by not remembering what it's like to be a kid.,"I (20m) had the hardest interaction of my life (so far) today. I was hone alone this morning, my family was out to eat but i had work later. I was enjoying some of my coffee when i heard a knock at the door, when i went to look it was one of the kids who lives a couple houses down, i opened the door and went outside because if i stayed inside my dog's would have ran outside, he asked me if there were any other kids who lived nearby who would want to play with him. I told him that i didn't know of any except my brother who spends six nights out a week for the sports he plays. i could tell that he was upset so i decided that this would be the perfect time to tell my experience in this department. i told him that i didn't have any friends until high school, and i didn't have any true friends until i got my first job. i wanted him to know that even if it takes some patience and waiting, he will make some amazing life long friends. he left after the sickest fist bump in the world and i went to work. 

I ONLY drank coffee this morning and basically passed out two hours into my shift from dehydration. i drank some water from my stores concessions, my boss paid for it, and went home. when i got home the kid was sitting on his porch crying and his mom consoling him, i asked what was wrong, from the sidewalk, and she just looked at me, asked him a question and then looked back at me and said ""are you the asshole who told my son he wont have kids until his first job?"" i explained what i said and how i was trying to help and she said ""He is a child, to him you basically just said he will die alone!"" i went back inside and told my aunt and she said that i could have put it into better terms because he is a kid. I just feel so bad because that was me. i was that kid who would cry with his mom because he didn't know how to make friends. I have cried four different times in the last six hours because i can't take it! 

TL:DR: I made a kid feel like he was going to die alone, it was a communication error.",16,1758416653.0,tifu,2,0.81,False

 I said something along the lines of ‚Äúhey I‚Äôve noticed we have similar beliefs and if you are interested I would love to grab a coffee or something with you. I would love to get to know you better‚Äù 

She replied on Tuesday saying ‚Äúlol sure‚Äù I replied ‚Äúbet what‚Äôs your week like?‚Äù She never replied.
