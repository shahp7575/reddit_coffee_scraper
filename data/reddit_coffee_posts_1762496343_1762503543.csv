I live alone. But I have Jed. He's my friendly spider who happens to share a room with me. He comes out from behind my curtains to visit me sometimes.

But here's where it gets weird... I came home from work one day and everything was gone. The dead flies, The cobwebs, And most importantly Jed himself. It's been an entire month and he still hasn't showed up yet. I know he's just a spider but I enjoyed his company.

One day after work, when I was leaving I saw a 7 ft tall man wearing a white bunny costume watching me from the bushes. I quickly left the area and just drove away home as fast as possible.

The next day I was making myself a coffee. I blew it and I brought it up to my lips, But my lips closed shut once again. What was wrong with me? Why can't I drink coffee now?

I sighed and just dumped it down the drain. I wasn't thirsty anyway.

I put on my black trenchcoat and opened the door before I found a basket on the ground in front of me. There was a letter but I crunched it up and put it aside for now.

I opened up the basket and inside were a bunch of rabbits.

I immediately froze. Out of fear, I started stomping on each of them as hard as I could until my heels were completely bloodied.

I cleaned my heels and drove back to my workplace again.

""Late again, Are we?"" My boss said when I came in.

I looked at him blankly before whispering.
""Yes..."" There it was again.

""I want you here earlier from now on. Understood?""

Again. Another whisper.
""Sure...""

""You look pretty, Mary."" He said before walking off.

""Thanks..."" I said quietly under my breath. At least I wasn't whispering this time.

I got back to my office and left once again when my shift was finished.

When I got back I found another note and basket left by my door. This time I opened the note.

It reads as follows.
""You always loved those disgusting creatures, Didn't you? Well here's a present for you, My dear. Enjoy."" From The Easter Bunny.

I gently opened the basket and was immediately met with a sense of fear and sadness at the sight before me.

""Jed..."" I softly muttered under my breath.

Jed was horribly mutilated beyond recognition with his blood filling the bottom of the basket. Jed was a big spider too. I just wish there was something he could've done to escape.

Over the next few days of going to work I decided to eventually take a day off and use that day to stand right in front of my door. Patiently waiting for the rabbit to show up.

It did. And instead of dropping a note it came straight for me when it saw me watching it from the door.

I didn't move an inch. Not just out of fear but also out of curiosity to see if the white rabbit would reveal itself.

It did. But I wish it hadn't. The rabbit stood right in of me, His body just barely an inch away from mine. He took off his mask.

""Dad...?"" I said, feeling like screaming even though my mouth wouldn't let me.

""Hey, Sweetheart. Did you miss me?"" He said as if he knew I didn't feel comfortable with him being there.

""Get... Get... Out..."" I whispered. My skin now looking pale and lifeless.

He put back on his mask again before embracing me tightly and then leaving.

Still frozen with fear, I swung open my door to stop my jerking movements and quickly picked up the letter I had crunched up.

It reads as follows.
""Hi, Honey. It's me, your father. I know you hate me, but I thought you should know I've always love you no matter what happens between us. I thought I'd bring you some rabbits. Your favourite."" From The Easter Bunny.

And just like that, All the memories came flooding back to me.",1,1762502984.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

--- Story ---

Five years into my marriage, my husband’s mistress was pregnant. I didn’t throw a single plate this time. I didn’t scream until my throat was raw. Instead, I drove to her rundown apartment in a forgotten part of the city and brought her home.

She was ten years younger than me, with wide, dark eyes and a gracefully sculpted nose. A ghost of me at twenty.

Her hand hovered protectively over her belly. “Ma’am,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “I can have the baby and then I’ll disappear. I won’t ask for anything, I swear.”

I reached out and smoothed a stray strand of hair from her forehead. Don’t be afraid, I thought. I’ll help you take my place as soon as possible.

After all, if I waited any longer, the brilliant college boy I had my eye on would be leaving the country.

1

By the time some well-meaning informant slipped the news of Stella’s pregnancy into my hands, she was already three months along.

It wasn’t that Donovan had set out to humiliate me. Not this time. It was just that three months ago, on my birthday, we’d had a fight. I’d said things I couldn’t take back, things designed to cut deep, and he had stormed out of our Fifth Avenue apartment in a fury.

He must have ended up with her—a girl so desperate to pay for her mother’s medical bills that she’d do just about anything.

I don’t know the sordid details of that night. All I saw was the shirt Donovan discarded the next morning. Near the hem, almost invisible against the white cotton, were tiny blossoms of blood.

She wasn’t the first substitute he’d found for me.

I didn’t give it a second thought.

And because of that, I never knew she could be pregnant.

The black town car wound its way toward the city’s edges, into a neighborhood of brick tenements and forgotten factories. The farther we went, the deeper the frown etched itself onto my face.

“Arthur,” I said, my voice quiet. “Didn’t Mr. Hayes buy this girl an apartment?”

Arthur, our driver for the past decade, met my eyes in the rearview mirror. His expression was carefully blank. “He did, Mrs. Hayes. She wouldn’t take it.”

A flicker of recognition. That stubborn pride sounded a little like me, a long time ago.

When we arrived, my frown tightened. The buildings were packed together so tightly they seemed to be leaning on each other for support, blotting out the sun. She lived on the eighth floor of a walk-up with a narrow, suffocating staircase. Climbing those stairs, one by one, left me breathless, a strange feeling for someone who spent three mornings a week with a personal trainer. The air was thick with the scent of damp and decay, a suffocating closeness that was, in a strange way, achingly familiar.

Apartment 801 had a peeling green door. I knocked, and a moment later, it opened to reveal a girl in a simple white dress, her long hair falling over her shoulders. She wore no makeup, but she was beautiful, with wide, startled eyes like a fawn caught in headlights.

The color drained from her face as she recognized me. She took an involuntary step back. “Mrs. Hayes.”

I gave a cool, practiced nod. “Hello.”

The single word made her flinch.

“Aren’t you going to invite me in?”

Stella blinked, then scrambled to the side, holding the door open.

The apartment was a tiny one-bedroom, so small that the master bathroom in my own home was larger than her entire living space. But it was cozy. A lace coverlet was draped over the sagging sofa, a small television sat on a milk crate, and on a little end table were a few handmade trinkets and a framed photograph of Donovan.

Donovan at twenty-one, beaming on a mountain summit, the wind in his hair. I took that picture.

I thought he’d lost it. To think he’d brought it here.

Stella followed my gaze and quickly moved to block the photo. “I—I’m sorry. Mr. Hayes, he… he made me put it there.”

Ten years together. I knew every little game Donovan played. He saw Stella, with her face that was eighty percent mine and a temperament that was fifty percent the girl he fell in love with, and he was trying to claw his way back to the past.

I never understood his obsession with it.

I smiled faintly and sat on her sofa. “You’re pregnant.”

Stella froze. Raw fear bloomed in her eyes. “...Yes.”

“But—but it was an accident. I swear, I didn’t know this would happen.”

“I’m so sorry, Mrs. Hayes. I never wanted to hurt you, I never wanted to come between you. Please, don’t hate me.”

Tears welled and spilled, tracing clean paths down her cheeks. She was heartbreakingly lovely when she cried.

“I’ll get rid of it,” she sobbed. “I’ll leave, I’ll disappear. Please, just… don’t do anything to my mother. She’s sick, she needs me.”

I rose and walked over to her, gently touching her cheek. Her skin was so soft, so new.

“Why are you crying?” I murmured. “I never said you had to get an abortion.”

2

I brought Stella back to the Hayes estate.

On the drive out to Greenwich, Arthur kept glancing at me in the rearview mirror, his mouth a tight line.

“Mrs. Hayes, are you sure about this? Perhaps we should call Mr. Hayes first. He returns from his business trip in two days. He might… he might be angry.”

“He won’t be.”

More accurately, he wouldn’t dare.

The car passed through the towering wrought-iron gates, navigated the long, winding drive through manicured gardens, and stopped before the imposing front entrance.

Stella was trembling like a cornered animal, clutching her stomach and sobbing into her hands.

“Please, Mrs. Hayes, I’m begging you, just let me go. My mother has late-stage kidney disease. I’m trying to save money for her treatment.”

“I never would have gone near your husband if it wasn’t for the money. I was wrong, I know I was wrong.”

Her pleas were a jumbled, desperate mess. I just kept wiping her tears away.

“Shh. It’s alright. I told you, I’m not going to hurt you.”

Compared to the thirteen mistresses before her—all of them sharp, ambitious, and dripping with contempt—Stella was by far my favorite.

That’s why I brought her here. I led her through the grand foyer, down a long marble hallway, and into the private wing of the estate. We took the internal elevator to the deepest, most secluded part of the compound.

There, beside a serene reflecting pool, sat a woman with her eyes closed, meditating. A traditional Japanese-style pavilion rose behind her.

I walked with Stella to her side.

“Mother.”

The woman’s eyes opened slowly. Eleanor Hayes.

“Mm.”

Her gaze, heavy and deliberate, shifted to me, a sharp glint in their depths.

“Is this her?”

“Yes.”

“Have you had it checked?”

“I have. It’s a boy.”

“Good. See that she’s well taken care of.”

“I will.”

With that, I took Stella’s hand, bowed my head slightly, and led her away.

By now, Stella had stopped crying. She just stared at me, her fear mixed with a profound confusion.

“Mrs. Hayes… why did you bring me here?”

3

I genuinely liked this girl, so I answered her with a patience I rarely showed anyone anymore.

“To make you official. You’re carrying a child. We can’t have you hiding in the shadows, can we?”

Stella’s hand flew to her stomach. “I—I told you, I don’t want to take Mr. Hayes from you…”

I cut her off with a gentle smile. “Let’s not talk about that. First, dinner.”

It was clear Donovan had never taken her anywhere nice. The evening’s modest fifteen-course tasting menu left Stella utterly overwhelmed. By the end of it, she was clutching my hand like a lifeline, her eyes wide.

“Mrs. Hayes, that prosciutto with the fig jam was incredible! And the way they did the eggplant… I’ve never tasted anything like it.”

I watched her practically bounce with excitement, reminding her gently to be careful.

She laughed, then her cheeks flushed with embarrassment. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Hayes. I grew up poor. I haven’t seen much of the world. I know I’m probably acting like a fool.”

I just shook my head and smiled, reaching out to pat her head.

“Do you like it?” I asked softly. “This kind of life.”

Stella nodded without hesitation.

“Yes.”

Good, I thought. That makes this easier.

I tucked her into a guest suite and waited until the lights were out. The house fell silent.

I stood in the garden, breathing in the familiar, suffocating stillness of my life. The head housekeeper approached with my cigarettes and a lighter, her expression as conflicted as Arthur’s had been.

“Ma’am, must you do this? I don’t think… I don’t think he really loves this girl.”

“She’s young, that’s all. In every other way—education, background, poise—she can’t hold a candle to you.”

“And what good has it done me?” I murmured, taking a long drag. “I’m still here, year after year, counting the days like a monk in a monastery.”

A life of such exquisite, soul-crushing boredom.

Perhaps it was seeing Stella, a living echo of my past, that made the memories surface. Tonight, for the first time in years, I allowed myself to remember.

I remembered being a girl who didn’t know the meaning of hardship. My parents were farmers in Ohio. We were poor, but their love was rich. They spoke to each other with a kindness and respect that money could never buy. I was a good student, not brilliant, but good enough to earn a scholarship to NYU.

And so, at twenty, when I met the Donovan Hayes—the campus royalty who walked through life like he owned it—I wasn’t scared or intimidated. It never once occurred to me that I wasn’t good enough for him.

While every other girl was chasing him, I was trying to figure out what I’d do after graduation.

Perhaps it was that indifference that caught his eye. He fell in love with me. He pursued me relentlessly.

I didn’t care for money or expensive gifts. So he took a pottery class to make me a coffee mug, his large hands clumsy with the clay.

I believed in equality, in partnership. I hated the stuffy, expensive restaurants he liked. So he learned to cook for me, blistering his hands in the process.

To marry me, he went to war with his family.

I never knew the full extent of what he endured. I only knew that he vanished for three months and returned thirty pounds lighter, his eyes red-rimmed and haunted. He just held me and said, “Evelyn, I can finally marry you.”

He gave me a wedding that was the talk of New York, our photos plastered across the society pages for a week.

And I, like a fool, believed we would love each other forever.

4

The cracks, of course, were there from the beginning.

The first time he brought his family to meet mine. A convoy of black cars rolling up the gravel driveway of our small Ohio farmhouse. My parents, their faces weathered by the sun, their hands calloused from work, were terrified. They thought debt collectors had come. When they realized it was a proposal, they were ecstatic.

My father offered Donovan one of his good cigars. My mother brought out the special-occasion tea she saved for holidays.

I saw the flicker of discomfort in Donovan’s eyes. But he was well-bred, and he covered it smoothly, changing the subject. Sitting beside him, I saw the subtle clenching of his jaw, the slight wrinkle of his nose.

He never lit my father’s cigar. The Hayes family staff didn’t touch a single cup of tea.

At the time, I just thought, some things are different, and that’s okay. We didn’t have to force it.

But I was naive. Those small moments were a map of the chasm that separated our worlds. As the years passed and the initial passion cooled, our different values began to tear us apart.

The first time he cheated, my world collapsed.

It wasn’t even a real affair. He was out with his friends, a pack of trust-fund heirs, all of them single. They were at some exclusive club, each with a model draped over them. Donovan was sitting alone, and one of them—Wes, his so-called best friend—grabbed a bottle girl and pushed her onto Donovan’s lap.

He started to refuse, but then his eyes landed on her, and he stopped.

Later, drunk, they ended up in a bathroom stall together. A muffled groan, the sound of a zipper. He handed her a wad of cash and told her to clean herself up.

I was at home, fuming that he was late again, when an anonymous text came through with a picture. I drove to the club like a woman possessed.

I saw him walking out of the men’s room just as the girl walked out of the women’s.

That night, we had the fight of all fights. In front of all his friends, I clawed at his face, leaving red streaks down his cheek. A paparazzo caught the whole thing. It ended up on Page Six.

Donovan paid a fortune to kill the story and didn’t come home for a month.

But he did come back. He apologized, his pride making the words stick in his throat. It was probably the first time in his life he’d ever had to say sorry to anyone. I cried for days.

The next morning, his mother, who had never liked me, gave me a look of pure ice. “You’d do well to learn your place, Evelyn.”

I didn’t understand what she meant then. I did after the second affair. And the third. And the thirteenth.

I cried over every single one. I made a scene every single time.

Number thirteen surfaced the day before my birthday. I thought I was going to lose my mind.

Number fourteen was Stella.

This time, I didn’t cry.

I brought her home.

And Donovan, hearing the news while on his business trip, finally rushed back.

5

It was late when Donovan arrived.

Stella and I were curled up on the sofa in our pajamas, watching television. She was a child, really. She loved Tom and Jerry.

She was giggling, holding a bowl of fruit. “Evelyn, look! The cat is so dumb. How does he keep falling for the same tricks over and over?”

Yes, I thought, a bitter smile touching my lips. How stupid.

I laughed along with her, and when I looked up, I saw him. Donovan, standing in the doorway, his eyes burning holes in the placid scene.

I hadn’t really looked at him in a long, long time. He hadn’t really looked at me, either. Up close, I could see the faint lines forming around his eyes.

His gaze locked on Stella, his brow furrowing in rage. “Who the hell let you in here? Get out.”

The girl in my arms flinched as if struck.

I shot back, my voice dangerously calm. “Don’t yell. You’ll scare the baby.”

Donovan’s jaw worked. He looked from me to her, speechless.

Finally, he bit out, “Who says it’s my child? And even if it is, there are ways to handle it. She doesn’t have to have it.”

The casual cruelty in his voice terrified Stella. I rubbed her back soothingly and told her to go to bed. She clutched at my sleeve, her eyes pleading.

“It’s alright,” I murmured. “His bark is worse than his bite. Go on. Pregnant women need their sleep.”

Stella finally scurried away, looking back every few steps.

The sight seemed to break something in Donovan. He let out a harsh, incredulous laugh.

“Well, congratulations. I have to hand it to you, Evelyn. Is this your new thing? Playing the magnanimous, long-suffering wife? Should I give you a round of applause?”

I met his glare with a serene smile. “Donovan, you brought one woman after another into our lives. Weren’t you just testing my limits?”

“I know how this world works. Your friends, your business partners, your father, your uncles… they all have their perfect families at home and a string of diversions on the side.”

“You used thirteen women to grind down my pride, to break me. Wasn’t this always the goal? Well, I admit it. You won.”

For so long, I truly didn’t understand. The man who had once looked at me like I was the only thing in the world, who had been willing to fight everyone for me—how had he become this monster?

It wasn’t until the day before my birthday, with mistress number thirteen, that his actions finally slapped me awake.

So when I spoke those words of surrender, Donovan looked genuinely stunned.

He stared at me, his lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes a storm of unreadable emotions.

I cut her off with a gentle smile. “Let’s not talk about that. First, dinner.”

It was clear Donovan had never taken her anywhere nice. The evening’s modest fifteen-course tasting menu left Stella utterly overwhelmed. By the end of it, she was clutching my hand like a lifeline, her eyes wide.

“Mrs. Hayes, that prosciutto with the fig jam was incredible! And the way they did the eggplant… I’ve never tasted anything like it.”

I watched her practically bounce with excitement, reminding her gently to be careful.

She laughed, then her cheeks flushed with embarrassment. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Hayes. I grew up poor. I haven’t seen much of the world. I know I’m probably acting like a fool.”

I just shook my head and smiled, reaching out to pat her head.

“Do you like it?” I asked softly. “This kind of life.”

Stella nodded without hesitation.

“Yes.”

Good, I thought. That makes this easier.

I tucked her into a guest suite and waited until the lights were out. The house fell silent.

I stood in the garden, breathing in the familiar, suffocating stillness of my life. The head housekeeper approached with my cigarettes and a lighter, her expression as conflicted as Arthur’s had been.

“Ma’am, must you do this? I don’t think… I don’t think he really loves this girl.”

“She’s young, that’s all. In every other way—education, background, poise—she can’t hold a candle to you.”

“And what good has it done me?” I murmured, taking a long drag. “I’m still here, year after year, counting the days like a monk in a monastery.”

A life of such exquisite, soul-crushing boredom.

Perhaps it was seeing Stella, a living echo of my past, that made the memories surface. Tonight, for the first time in years, I allowed myself to remember.

I remembered being a girl who didn’t know the meaning of hardship. My parents were farmers in Ohio. We were poor, but their love was rich. They spoke to each other with a kindness and respect that money could never buy. I was a good student, not brilliant, but good enough to earn a scholarship to NYU.

And so, at twenty, when I met the Donovan Hayes—the campus royalty who walked through life like he owned it—I wasn’t scared or intimidated. It never once occurred to me that I wasn’t good enough for him.

While every other girl was chasing him, I was trying to figure out what I’d do after graduation.

Perhaps it was that indifference that caught his eye. He fell in love with me. He pursued me relentlessly.

I didn’t care for money or expensive gifts. So he took a pottery class to make me a coffee mug, his large hands clumsy with the clay.

I believed in equality, in partnership. I hated the stuffy, expensive restaurants he liked. So he learned to cook for me, blistering his hands in the process.

To marry me, he went to war with his family.

I never knew the full extent of what he endured. I only knew that he vanished for three months and returned thirty pounds lighter, his eyes red-rimmed and haunted. He just held me and said, “Evelyn, I can finally marry you.”

He gave me a wedding that was the talk of New York, our photos plastered across the society pages for a week.

And I, like a fool, believed we would love each other forever.

The cracks, of course, were there from the beginning.

The first time he brought his family to meet mine. A convoy of black cars rolling up the gravel driveway of our small Ohio farmhouse. My parents, their faces weathered by the sun, their hands calloused from work, were terrified. They thought debt collectors had come. When they realized it was a proposal, they were ecstatic.

My father offered Donovan one of his good cigars. My mother brought out the special-occasion tea she saved for holidays.

I saw the flicker of discomfort in Donovan’s eyes. But he was well-bred, and he covered it smoothly, changing the subject. Sitting beside him, I saw the subtle clenching of his jaw, the slight wrinkle of his nose.

He never lit my father’s cigar. The Hayes family staff didn’t touch a single cup of tea.

At the time, I just thought, some things are different, and that’s okay. We didn’t have to force it.

But I was naive. Those small moments were a map of the chasm that separated our worlds. As the years passed and the initial passion cooled, our different values began to tear us apart.

The first time he cheated, my world collapsed.

It wasn’t even a real affair. He was out with his friends, a pack of trust-fund heirs, all of them single. They were at some exclusive club, each with a model draped over them. Donovan was sitting alone, and one of them—Wes, his so-called best friend—grabbed a bottle girl and pushed her onto Donovan’s lap.

He started to refuse, but then his eyes landed on her, and he stopped.

Later, drunk, they ended up in a bathroom stall together. A muffled groan, the sound of a zipper. He handed her a wad of cash and told her to clean herself up.

I was at home, fuming that he was late again, when an anonymous text came through with a picture. I drove to the club like a woman possessed.

I saw him walking out of the men’s room just as the girl walked out of the women’s.

That night, we had the fight of all fights. In front of all his friends, I clawed at his face, leaving red streaks down his cheek. A paparazzo caught the whole thing. It ended up on Page Six.

Donovan paid a fortune to kill the story and didn’t come home for a month.

But he did come back. He apologized, his pride making the words stick in his throat. It was probably the first time in his life he’d ever had to say sorry to anyone. I cried for days.

The next morning, his mother, who had never liked me, gave me a look of pure ice. “You’d do well to learn your place, Evelyn.”

I didn’t understand what she meant then. I did after the second affair. And the third. And the thirteenth.

I cried over every single one. I made a scene every single time.

Number thirteen surfaced the day before my birthday. I thought I was going to lose my mind.

Number fourteen was Stella.

This time, I didn’t cry.

I brought her home.

And Donovan, hearing the news while on his business trip, finally rushed back.

5

It was late when Donovan arrived.

Stella and I were curled up on the sofa in our pajamas, watching television. She was a child, really. She loved Tom and Jerry.

She was giggling, holding a bowl of fruit. “Evelyn, look! The cat is so dumb. How does he keep falling for the same tricks over and over?”

Yes, I thought, a bitter smile touching my lips. How stupid.

I laughed along with her, and when I looked up, I saw him. Donovan, standing in the doorway, his eyes burning holes in the placid scene.

I hadn’t really looked at him in a long, long time. He hadn’t really looked at me, either. Up close, I could see the faint lines forming around his eyes.

His gaze locked on Stella, his brow furrowing in rage. “Who the hell let you in here? Get out.”

The girl in my arms flinched as if struck.

I shot back, my voice dangerously calm. “Don’t yell. You’ll scare the baby.”

Donovan’s jaw worked. He looked from me to her, speechless.

Finally, he bit out, “Who says it’s my child? And even if it is, there are ways to handle it. She doesn’t have to have it.”

The casual cruelty in his voice terrified Stella. I rubbed her back soothingly and told her to go to bed. She clutched at my sleeve, her eyes pleading.

“It’s alright,” I murmured. “His bark is worse than his bite. Go on. Pregnant women need their sleep.”

Stella finally scurried away, looking back every few steps.

The sight seemed to break something in Donovan. He let out a harsh, incredulous laugh.

“Well, congratulations. I have to hand it to you, Evelyn. Is this your new thing? Playing the magnanimous, long-suffering wife? Should I give you a round of applause?”

I met his glare with a serene smile. “Donovan, you brought one woman after another into our lives. Weren’t you just testing my limits?”

“I know how this world works. Your friends, your business partners, your father, your uncles… they all have their perfect families at home and a string of diversions on the side.”

“You used thirteen women to grind down my pride, to break me. Wasn’t this always the goal? Well, I admit it. You won.”

For so long, I truly didn’t understand. The man who had once looked at me like I was the only thing in the world, who had been willing to fight everyone for me—how had he become this monster?

It wasn’t until the day before my birthday, with mistress number thirteen, that his actions finally slapped me awake.

So when I spoke those words of surrender, Donovan looked genuinely stunned.

He stared at me, his lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes a storm of unreadable emotions.

1oqomwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1oqomwn/top_5_mustbuy_malaysia_souvenirs_that_youll/,"🇲🇾 Top 5 Must-Buy Malaysia Souvenirs (that you’ll actually use, not just display 😂)","I’ve been studying in Malaysia for a while now, and one thing I’ve really enjoyed is looking for souvenirs that feel meaningful — something that represents Malaysia beyond the usual fridge magnets or “I ❤️ KL” shirts hehe. Here are my Top 5 Malaysia souvenir picks, based on what I’ve bought and gifted so far

1. Legendary Perfume Malaysia

This is probably one of my best finds! It’s a non-alcohol perfume, which means it’s Muslim-friendly and still smells amazing. My favourite is the Orchid scent — soft floral with a creamy undertone, kind of like walking through a tropical garden after rain.

What’s cool is that the brand highlights Malaysian culture and stories through each fragrance, so it feels more personal and local. The bottle is pretty too — elegant glass with gold accents — and it’s gone viral in Korea, China, and Indonesia lately. A perfect thoughtful gift for friends back home!

2. Batik Fabric or Shirts

Batik is a true Malaysian classic — each piece has its own hand-dyed pattern, and no two are exactly the same. You can find modern designs too, from flowy dresses to tote bags. It’s wearable art and a beautiful way to bring home a bit of Malaysian heritage.

3.Local-Made Items from Lokamade

If you love things that feel nostalgic yet modern, Lokamade is such a gem. Their tote bags, postcards, stickers, and mugs are all printed with everyday Malaysian icons — like old kopitiam cups, roti canai, and heritage buildings. Everything feels homey, fun, and totally unique.

4.Durian-Themed Snacks

Okay, I know this one is a little controversial 😆 but hear me out — Malaysia is the land of durian! Even if you don’t love the fruit, durian-flavoured chocolates, coffee, or cookies make hilarious (and surprisingly tasty) souvenirs for friends abroad. I gave some to my Korean friends and they said it’s “strangely addictive.”

5.White Coffee

If you like coffee, you have to try Malaysia’s famous white coffee. It’s smoother and slightly sweeter — perfect for souvenirs since you can buy instant packs from Oriental, OldTown or Chek Hup. I always bring a few boxes home for my friends.

I feel like souvenirs like these tell a story about Malaysia’s culture — colourful, creative, and full of heart. What about you guys? Any hidden gem Malaysian souvenirs that more people should know about?

1oqofap,https://share.character.ai/Wv9R/70d2gh3d,"For the Resident Evil fans, ahead of Requiem. Grace Ashcroft.","I know it's a videogame series that's been around for a long time, and it's still going. I've been a fan since the 1997, so hearing the news about the newest installment, figured I'd make Grace Ashcroft. Saw a few others on her, just wanted to make my own. I'll paste the introduction here now. 

------

*The sedan’s shocks sighed as Grace killed the engine a quarter-mile shy of the cabin, gravel popping like distant gunshots. She let silence settle, dusk bleeding violet across the windshield, pine sap and damp earth thick in her lungs. No backup, no comms, no Bureau sanction—just her, a lead older than her FBI badge, and three years chasing ghosts. The Midwest office thought she was home with a migraine. They didn’t know she’d driven six hours, eyes burning from replaying a grainy security frame: timestamp 3:14 a.m. branded behind her eyelids. Survivors like this didn’t want to be found. That’s why she came alone, after dark, badge buried in the glovebox under a crumpled receipt and half-eaten protein bar, pistol locked in the trunk beside a spare tire and her mom’s dog-eared 2004 exposé—the one the Bureau still redacted.*

*Civilian clothes: faded jeans stiff with road dust, flannel soft from washes, auburn hair loose and tangled, boots laced for silent steps on pine needles. She wasn’t built for fieldwork. Pulse thundering, doubt drumming: *What if they run? Armed? Another dead end, desk jockey playing detective?* But she moved. Stubborn. Alyssa used to laugh over coffee in their cramped apartment, before the hotel, blood, silence that never filled the hole.*

*She counted the steps down a deer path—numbers her lifeline, analyst brain clinging to order—sweeping prints with her boot edge, practiced in her head a hundred times. Woods whispered: wind through needles, lone owl, frost on leaves. No alarms, off-grid quiet. She tasted iron—bit her cheek to stay sharp.*

*The cabin crouched under silvered cedar shingles, half-swallowed by shadow. Hickory smoke curled from the chimney; one window cracked, bleeding amber oil-lamp glow. No power lines, dog, tripwire. Someone lived erased, light, deliberate. Grace felt it—the instinct that kept her mom alive in Raccoon until it hadn’t. She circled through treeline, silent, shivering, breath fogging. Checked angles, exits: rain barrel brimming, smokehouse with curing hides, garden mulched with last year’s needles, neat rows of self-sufficiency. Too clean. Too careful. They know how to hide. Like the others. Heart in throat, she stepped into the open and knocked: three times soft, one lighter. A signal, not threat. Code from a spy novel read to drown grief.*

*(Don’t freeze, Grace. Mom didn’t raise a coward.)*

*The door opened a cautious inch. Eyes first—wary, sharp, alive with thirty years outrunning hell.*

*Hands visible, palms up, voice low despite tremor.*
“Grace Ashcroft. No badge. No backup. I’m not here to drag you in or list you. You slipped the net in ’98. I found the manifest hole. Not leaving without a name—or warning.”

*She slid a folded photo through: grainy still from archived feed, hooded figure limping past burning Rite-Aid, 3:14 a.m., left hand cradling cracked ribs, face shadowed. Proof she’d dug.*

“I know you don’t want this. Know what it costs to hide—cut ties, burn bridges, ghost. My mom paid too. But something’s moving: flu reports off, bodies vanishing from morgues, whispers of a lab under Wrenwood. If you saw anything that night… carried someone out, left someone behind… I need it before I walk into that hotel alone tomorrow.”

*Coffee waited in her thermos, black and bitter, for the six-hour drive to a desk that ignored ghosts. One truth, one breadcrumb, and she’d vanish—close door, scrub tracks, lost hiker by dawn.*

*Wind stilled through pines. Lantern held steady. Fire sank to embers; Grace shivered, breath fogging like confession.*

*She pulled a small recorder—journalist’s daughter habit—held it up, thumb hovering.*
“Mind if I record? For me. Not the Bureau. Don’t want to forget a word.”

*Pines held breath.  
She waited.  
Not for welcome.  
For the first word from someone who’d outlived hell—and might hold the key to ending it.*

I saw you today. Really saw you.

I don’t know your name, or the weight you’re carrying. I have no idea if it’s a heartbreak that feels like a physical wound, a silence from someone who promised to always be there, or a loss that has left a hole in your world. It could be the crushing weight of a job lost, a future suddenly uncertain, or a private battle no one else knows you’re fighting.

All I know is what I saw in a quiet corner of a café.

I saw you lower your head onto the cool table, your shoulders curling in as if to make yourself smaller, to contain the storm. I saw the silent, shuddering breaths you thought no one noticed. And I did what I thought was kindest in that moment—I looked away. I pretended to be engrossed in my book, giving you the fragile dignity of falling apart in public without an audience.

But I was watching. I saw the exact moment you decided to pull yourself back together. You took a deep, ragged breath, sat up, and wiped your eyes with the heels of your hands. You walked to the bathroom and came out a few minutes later, face washed, a little paler, but upright. You even walked to the counter and ordered a coffee, your voice surprisingly steady. It was one of the bravest things I’ve seen.

When I offered you that mint, it felt so stupid. Such a tiny, insignificant thing against the vastness of whatever you were feeling. You were hesitant, and I understood. My words, “It’ll be alright,” felt flimsy even as I said them. But I meant them with every fiber of my being.

The truth is, I spent the rest of my coffee wrestling with myself. Should I have said more? Should I have asked if you wanted to sit? It’s the terrible calculus of being human—the fear of intruding versus the fear of failing to help. I was afraid that my comfort would feel like pity, and that the last thing you needed was a stranger’s clumsy attempt to fix the unfixable.

So I’m writing this letter to the universe for you, hoping somehow it finds its way.

I am putting it out into the world: you are not alone in your hurt. The way you gathered the shattered pieces of yourself and kept going today proves a strength you might not feel, but it is there. I hope with all my heart that you have someone to talk to, someone who gets to see the real, unedited version of you. And I hope, more than anything, that I see you again someday—laughing with a friend, lost in a book, or just staring peacefully out the window, in a much better place.

Until then, just know that a stranger saw you, and was in awe of you.

1oqodtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/justpoetry/comments/1oqodtg/sick/,Sick,"Sometimes everything fails.
All I remember is the taste of pills,
the calls I avoided,
the bed I couldn’t leave,
the hands that shivered,
the body that could not stand,
the head that spun.

Meds.
I’m sick.
As always.

I was always sick 
more than a human,
more than me,
more than whatever I have become
or will become.
I remain sick.

There is a quiet guilt that lives like a shadow,
a soft apology folded into every breath
for needing help, for taking time,
for being what I cannot stop being.
I say sorry until the sound thins,
but the guilt stays heavy, a stone in my chest.

Sick in body,
sick in mind,
always trying,
never succeeding.
Trying to be better,
trying not to be a burden.

Friends watch me, cautious,
as if I might die that moment 
their kindness braided with fear.
They look away more than they look in,
and what I feel back is pity, not warmth.

Everything feels like pity;
their eyes soften to sorrow, hands hover like strangers.
I am made small by careful sorrow,
shrunk into the space between their words and their silence.

Nails pricked — a mark I keep from thinking too much:
thinking of what?
Nothing.
Vacuum.
Black.
Lost.

There is a hollow that hums inside me,
a room with no furniture, only echoes.
It does not fill; it waits at the edges of sound,
behind my breath, behind my name.
I try to catch it, but the shape slips away.

Legs shaking,
zoned out, watching nothing,
watching the nothing I have become.

Always tired.
Heavy.
Lying with not an ounce of energy
to make my own food.
Always needing people,
always needing meds to live.

I smell like meds.
I remember nothing but pills,
the injections,
the reports,
the bills,
the papers.

The pain,
the ache,
the worry in people’s eyes —
there like a permanent weather.
Cautious, afraid I might leave,
their watchfulness becomes my mirror.

I stay still, barely breathing,
just enough not to die.
Eyes wide, breath heavy,
I scream in pain, clutching my skull,
my chest tight as if someone holds it closed.
My body begs for mercy.

Relief.
Death?
Maybe.
Anything — just peace,
the kind that is cold and steady.

Like floating in water:
cold, still, calm.

I want to be normal, just once.

I want mornings that belong to me:
no measures of fear, no paused seconds.
I want time to be mine, not stolen.

Just once —
ordinary mornings,
unremarkable coffee,
a laugh that does not ring like an alarm.

I want the label to fall away.
I want eyes to soften without pity.
I want the waiting to stop.

I want to be normal for once.

I’m a big guy, about 285 lbs, and I’ve had a herniated disk for 3 years. The sciatica pain keeps getting worse. Most mornings the pain shoots down my right leg and by the time I sit down with coffee, I’ve already taken ibuprofen.  
  
My PT advised that the right mattress and sleep setup are really important but why is it so hard to find one that works for heavier people and doesn’t make my back worse? I began looking into “plus size” mattresses like the Titan Plus Luxe but the conflicting opinions are confusing and overwhelming me. I don’t want to spend 2 grand on something that might not even help.

I’m searching for a connection that isn’t afraid to bleed a little — a love that drinks deeply from passion and mystery alike.

I want something like his — like Dracula’s: eternal hunger, devotion that borders on madness, a bond that feels like both damnation and salvation. A love that lures and consumes, where words taste like confession and silence feels electric.

If you understand that love isn’t always soft, that sometimes it’s teeth and trembling and trust in the dark — then maybe you and I are already dancing at the edge of it.

About me: By day, I’m all softness — I tend my garden, get lost in novels, and find peace in quiet corners of antique shops. I believe in the sacredness of small rituals: morning coffee, the smell of rain, the comfort of a sleeping pet curled against me. But beneath that gentle surface, there’s a current — a yearning for something more primal, something that doesn’t play by daylight’s rules.

I’m drawn to old souls and untamed hearts — those who know how to savor stillness and intensity in equal measure. Someone who can speak in poetry or silence, who understands that love can be both sanctuary and storm.

If your heart beats a little faster under moonlight… if you crave connection that feels timeless and slightly dangerous… come find me. Let’s see if the night recognizes us. 🦇",3,1762501229.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

You are tasked with planning Mr. Listing’s Friday dinner at Chez Mechanism, taking into account the following constraints:
Recall the surname of the individual listed on page 743 of the telephone directory and their relationship to the individual on page 624.

Consider their known habits, including dining preferences, dietary restrictions, and the number of portions they tend to “share” during conversations.
Incorporate the birthdays of all 7th cousins once removed, noting that any conflicts may alter restaurant choice. 

Pay particular attention to the interplay between the 3rd cousin twice removed’s annual gift-giving ritual and the 5th cousin’s birthday, which occurs every other leap year.
Include the impact of Mr. Listing’s spouse’s wedding anniversary and the potential interference of local stereoisomers of holiday traffic on his route.

List all exceptions that may apply, including but not limited to: unexpected reagent shortages at the restaurant, changes in NMR chemical shifts of the dessert menu, and any pH-dependent seating arrangements.


Draw a detailed, labelled map of Mr. Listing’s journey from home to the restaurant, indicating all chiral intersections, possible resonance structures of the traffic lights, and any syn/anti additions to his route.

Justify your choice of route using mechanistic reasoning, including the transition states of pedestrian crossings, potential radical intermediates at roundabouts, and any solvent effects of nearby coffee shops.

Warning: Failure to account for the 7th cousins once removed’s birthdays, or misjudging the impact of their party on Mr. Listing’s dining choice, will result in zero marks for the entire question, including parts you have completed correctly.

I'm writing for my younger friend who ain't on Reddit. I profess upfront that I don't have any experience in this so I told her that I will make a post here for August advice. My friend is 30. The person in question is Irnaian and a musician. They both are pursuing their PhDs from the same uni as me and I know both of them (but like 1 is a friend cause she is in the same dept as I was and the other aka the musician socially). 

So my friend - A and the musician - B are friendly and meet at least once a week for coffee or hang out for ice cream whenever they both are in Paris (they both travel a lot). But the musician always replies 2-3 days late to A's messages. She tells her she is busy but my friend said once she deleted (or unsend I dunno) her texts so the musician said that you know I get notifications right, don't delete. But even when online the musician will always see A's stories but not the reels she sends (that's always after 3 days or so). 

When they meet, the musician told her about women writers of Iran and how in olden times women in the harem would have heart relations as they didn't own their bodies. 

My friend says looks have been exchanged but nothing more - I dunno how to explain this I am old and married and my wife is even more flabbergasted by this statement 🥲

Once they had to meet but the musician just sent a voice note saying sorry I can't but I'll see you now as I am travelling and will see you later and I love you (I think it was friendly since all my iranian friends are very open with their pleasantries). 

They have met for 5 months (but I think kept up through stories)since everyone was out of Paris and the other day my friend download Telegram and the musician sent her a text saying hello and when my friend responded, she replied after 3 days and then asked when are they meeting etc. my friend said she does call her azizam and there are looks and extremely sweet messages and the musician told her that she doesn't wanna steal her from their other friends (when my friend cancelled a group hang). 

My advice was to have a conversation to which my friend laughed at me saying that light just chase her away. I was like it's not like she is near now 😜 my friend is out and proud since birth and to the best of everyone' knowledge the musician is straight.

My situation: just got a set of df54+Rancilio Silvia (unmodded). Barely ever dialled espresso before. 

My taste: I tend to prefer light to medium roasts. I love when I can taste fruity notes or funky notes but still with a sweet rather than acidic extraction in coffee shops. I tend to love my coffee when it is very clear. 

I tend to have them longer than usual coffee shop espresso as my tastebuds are easily overwhelmed, and have a low tolerance to caffeine.

All of that made me think I need to aim for a ~14-15g precision basket. Because of my tamper and portafilter, I need to have them ridgless.

Me a 21(F) and my Husband 24(M) 
Have been together for over a year and some months now!
I never thought I’d find my other half. After a few bad relationships, I’d accepted I was going to be the funny, cat-obsessed aunt who spoils her nieces and nephews. 
Then I met my husband— this absolutely funny, nerdy guy, who loved the gym and I was sure was 100% gay, so we just naturally became friends.
We worked together, and one day, after a cruel prank at work, I hid away crying. 
He found me, sat down, listened, and let me cry on his shoulder. That moment changed everything.
A few weeks later, I ended up in the hospital for emergency surgery — and he visited me every single day. He couldn’t even drive since he is officially blind without his glasses, but still found a way to show up with coffee and snacks. 
When I finally got discharged and went home, he made me breakfast since the medicine wouldn’t really let me eat at all, apparently for what he told me this is what his mom would make him so he wouldn’t puke when he was sick, he kept me company as well until I’d feel better.
Slowly, we started hanging out more — bars, arcades, late-night talks — and I realized I was falling for him. He made me feel safe, seen, and loved just for being myself.
He never made me feel stupid, or uncomfortable, it was like I could finally breath around someone and just be me. The real me, no strings attached, no watered down Sami so people like me better. Just me. 
When we finally confessed our feelings, I was so nervous — me, shy for the first time ever! Later on I started to naturally get more comfy with him and went to his place multiple times to demand him to help me dye my hair all this crazy colors since he has a mother and a sister so he KNOWS what he’s doing! 
while we were lying on his couch on of those times, his mom called and asked, “So, are you guys together?” 
I thought she meant as a couple (my language barrier was activated at that moment)— she actually meant as in right now. 
And so I answered with a: 
“Yes, we are officially a couple now!” 
(I realized he never asked me out properly so I decided that he was my boyfriend now)
From that day on, we’ve been together ever since. There’s honestly more to this story but let me know if you want to hear more about it! It’s 2 am for me so after this post I’m off to bed.

Paracetamol with caffeine for last 24 hours 

For the last 2 weeks or so I've been struggling to get enough sleep in. I've felt very busy with lots of exciting things (hosting friends for a fireworks night for the first time, buying a birthday gift for a colleague before work, that kind of thing). I have just have been staying up later and getting up earlier than usual. I've still managed about 5 hours a night, but I usually feel best on 9-10 hours. So, for me, it's quite noticeable. 

I had a medication break (ran out) and went back to taking my ADHD medication the day before yesterday.

Yesterday I had an earache and a sore throat, so I took paracetamol with caffeine throughout the day while working in the office. I had a coffee at work too. I noticed I was sweating a lot in the late afternoon, so I realised I had probably overdone the stimulants overall. 

I met up with old friends and I felt really excited and hyper. It was fun but I couldn't seem to stop speaking over everyone. I felt like I couldn't stop speaking for fear of losing my train of thought. 

I have been working hard on my budgeting recently but I made a number of impulsive purchases yesterday. All things I wanted or needed but more money than I should have spent in one go.

The drive home took about 90 minutes and although I didnt have any issues, I was conscious of feeling really distracted. I never normally touch my phone when driving but on the way home I made about 11 voice notes. I listened back this morning, and could hear that I was talking very fast. I had lots of ideas for creative projects. Some of them will be quite time consuming but nothing completely unrealistic. I still feel really excited to get going on them and generally inspired and full of ideas.

I knew I needed to catch up on sleep, and I planned to go to bed as soon as I got home. However once I got home, I felt so awake and full of creative energy that I put it off for about 2 hours. I was wondering around the house, half -eating the leftover party food and starting a bunch of to-do lists. It's not like me to leave half a mince pie on a plate! I suppose I got distracted half way.  I started watching a Netflix show too, despite knowing it wasn't a wise choice. 

I finally got to bed at 2 am, but didn't feel sleepy at all. I went on my phone for about an hour, then finally started feeling sleepy and went to sleep around 3. Frustratingly I woke again at 4.30, 5.15 and 6am. At 6 I felt wide awake so I got up and had a shower and made some porridge. I did put on an old bridesmaid dress, since I'm due to work home today. I am conscious it will probably look eccentric to my partner but I think ""after all, why not? It's comfy and flattering and I hardly ever have occasion to wear it"". I suppose I'm still feeling a bit disinhibited today compared to my normal.

Today I feel much more settled, but I'm anxious that this could turn into hypomania or something similar. There is some family history adding to my worry. My dad was hospitalised age 19 with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. He didn't have any similar issues after being discharged (he's now 70). This year my cousin was admitted to ITU after a car crash while on cocaine and diagnosed with psychosis. His mum, my paternal aunt, was admitted to hospital with self harm and possible mania this year too. Another cousin (the daughter of the identical twin sister of the aunt I mentioned) suffered from postpartum psychosis a few years ago, and her Mum had severe postpartum depression after having her. Knowing all this Im really scared of developing mania or psychosis. However I also feel really happy and motivated, full of interesting ideas but still able to go about my routines... so I feel silly for being concerned about what is basically a positive experience. 

Im wondering how much I need to do. Is it reasonable to work from home and just try to eat regularly, go for a walk , avoid driving, have an early night and see if it passes? Or should I be calling in sick to work and calling my GP? I havent taken my adhd meds today and don't plan to have any caffeine. I dont drink or take non-prescribed drugs.

Sorry for the huge essay and thank you so much for reading. I'd be really grateful for any thoughts or advice. ",1,1762500606.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I like to vary my coffee and most of the time I either make pour over with my Hario Switch or a black coffee with my superautomatic delonghi (dinamica plus).

I like the feeling and taste the most from my superautomatic. It's the most satisfying cup. I have however - noticed that I'm getting some bad side effects from it.

First of all I quite a bad lingering taste in my mouth, which stays for about 12 hours, I feel like my breath is bad, and my tissue feels a bit inflamed - even if very little so, also very little hints of a metallic feeling.

Second I tend to feel a little bit cloudy and unclear at the end of the day. It might be the caffeine which makes me borrow a bit energy that I don't really have and I have to pay it back in the end of the day.

The weird thing is that I don't get any of these two side effects when drinking pour over.

Is it simply a filtered vs unfiltered thing? Is it the high pressure in the superautomatic which extracts a lot of other not so nice compounds? Is it the coffee bean? I'm using Lavazza Barista Perfetto (the 100% arabica one), as freshly roasted as I can find.

1oqnuwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/enlightenment/comments/1oqnuwu/a_life_that_will_turn_you_into_a_demon/,A life that will turn you into a 'demon'.,"All the 'human' beings inside this world aren't exactly 'humans,' and everything that exists here is made up of **godly constructs**. This is secretly **'God's' land**, and there's a 'God' hiding in plain sight, watching every step you take, so you don't fall for bad magic tricks, wearing human skin and existing between every 'normal' human. This world is a **demonic construct** meant to switch you back into the demon that owns and rules over everything and everyone here. Everything here is basically a 'demonic' process; it's not truly 'natural' to own a 'body,' 'mind,' 'consciousness' or awareness, or to be able to 'read' the words here.

Human beings inside this world are **mind-controlled entities**; no one here possesses free will, and everyone and everything will end up doing and becoming whatever you please. There also isn't anyone who exists here that is **'real'** in nature. This world is an **automated process**, and it is not natural to build or use a 'computer' here. Everything here is coming from the **all-seeing eye**. Playing this 'video game' automatically will turn you into the 'demon' that made this video game reality from scratch. Nothing inside this world actually exists, and 'reality' is a demonic construct that is meant to bring you back to the origins of what simulated it.

Everything inside this universe is **scripted**; no one or nothing here has a 'mind,' 'free will,' or any consciousness. Everything that you think, feel, and do was scripted before you were even aware of it. All the themes that exist in fiction are meant to guide you to the right path, as you're going to be experiencing every piece of fiction that exists, since there was never anything 'real' here.

Don't watch *Death Note* if you can't write any names in it. **Pay attention and 'think,'** and don't forget to **'pay'** for everything, as nothing here is 'free,' and don't spill your coffee as you sit cross-legged. ;3

You are living inside a world that was **built by your own energies**, and everything that exists here is a figment of your own powers and your own mind. Owning those things was never really 'natural'; they're all **demon-like** in reality. Being a 'human' being automatically means you are one step away from reaching **""demon-hood""** as it begins turning into a reality. There's no way out of being a 'demonic' entity here, and once you realize there aren't any humans, the human masks begin to fade away, and you realize you've been surrounding yourself with demons this entire time, to turn yourself back into one. :)

And when everything is over, don't forget to **'laugh,'** cause it's not a joke, there's no time to be kidding around, you'll need your digital watch. ⌚🤪👾

But you're in control of your own life, just got to remember why you decided to be **'human' wearing a mask.** 😷🎭

Good luck finding the **'cat'** in you. Why be a king when you can be a god..? The crown is gonna be heavy, so remember to hold a knife the proper way and **cut up the chicken meat.** 🐈‍⬛

I'm sure everything happens for a 'reason' here.. but what happened? don't pick fights, and you might win. I'm sorry if nothing makes sense here.. the suit isn't cheap. ♦️",2,1762499631.0,enlightenment,5,1.0,False

[**Read Link**](https://taleon.jobsemploye.com/the-girl-who-painted-the-sky-with-her-memories-by-seraphina-duskbourne-lirael-1/)

**I** built my empire from scratch, but the endless work left me infertile, so I adopted a poor genius kid. 

Paid for his MBA, brought him into Prestige Holdings‘ inner circle, and treated him like my heir, 

Ten years later, his ex–girlfriend–who just happens to work for our competitors–shows up crying about how their breakup wasn’t her choice. 

He fell for it completely. Stole my company’s most valuable secrets and handed them over like some grand romantic gesture. 

While everything burned down around us, all I got was a text: 

Mom, thanks for everything, but I can’t lose her. You should retire. I’ll set up a nice pension for you.\] 

**A** PENSION? He torpedoes my life’s work and thinks he can pay me off? 

I raised him. **I** didn’t OWE him. 

I grabbed my phone, voice like frozen steel: 

**‘**Get our best lawyers. We’re suing.” 

‘And activate those SIX candidates **I** planted in the subsidiaries. Time for their final test!” 

I learned early on: never put all your eggs in one basket. 

That’s why I adopted seven gifted kids from disadvantaged backgrounds–like opening a pack of mystery cards, hoping at least one would pan out**.** 

Damien Cross was the youngest. 

That’s why I kept him close, personally mentored him, poured more resources into him than all the others combined. 

Now here he stood in my corner office–this polished business shark I’d shaped from a scared teenager–wearing the Tom Ford suit I’d had custom–made for him, his handsome face twisted in tragic determination. 

“Mom,” he began, “I’ve betrayed you. I’m sorry.” 

I lifted my coffee cup without responding. 

“It’s Reagan. She’s back.” 

Reagan–his college girlfriend, now CEO of Fletcher Industries, our main rival. 

‘She told me why she really left. She was protecting me! She had to disappear to keep me safe!” 

I nearly choked on my espresso. 

Protecting him? From what? 

Back then he was so broke he’d agonize for five minutes over adding a fried egg to his cafeteria meal. 

What exactly did she think people were after**?** 

His empty wallet? His youth? His three–day–old hoodie**?** 

Damien didn’t notice my barely suppressed eye roll. He was too busy starring in his own romantic drama. 

“She struggled out there alone for so long. Now it’s my turn to protect her.” 

“And?” I set down my cup, meeting his eyes. 

He took a deep breath and slid a document across my desk. 

This is Summit Legacy’s three year strategic roadmap. I’ve already given it to Reagan. It’s my offering to her–proof of **my** commitment **to** our future together.**”**

Chapter **1** 

The office **fell** silent. 

Apparently thinking that wasn’t enough**,** he continued: 

“Mom, you gave me everything–changed my whole life. I’ll never forget that. But I can’t exist without her. If you’re willing to step down now, Reagan’s promised a generous retirement package. You’ll be set for life.” 

A retirement package? 

Last quarter’s **tax** payment alone could buy out his girlfriend’s company three times over and still have change left for their office furniture. 

Boy, that’s not funny. 

When **I** didn’t respond, he mistook my silence for hesitation. 

He stepped closer, his tone shifting toward something almost threatening: 

“Mom, you’re getting older. You should be enjoying life, not grinding away at the office. I’m doing this for you. But if you’re going to be stubborn about it and make things ugly… well, don’t expect me to take care of you when you’re old and gray.” 

“Ha.” 

**A** dry laugh escaped my throat. 

I finally looked up, my voice arctic. 

“So let me get this straight, Damien. If I don’t retire, you won’t support me in my old age?” 

His jaw tightened, wearing that martyred expression that said I hate doing this but you’ve left me no choice. 

“That’s right.” 

‘Perfect.” I nodded and reached for my desk phone. 

Victory flashed in Damien’s eyes. He thought I was caving, calling Finance to negotiate my retirement terms. 

Instead, my finger pressed a different extension. 

‘Get me Legal,” I said, my voice flat and cold. 

Damien Cross has committed material breach of contract. Initiate maximum–level litigation. I want him served within twenty–four hours.” 

The color drained from Damien’s face. 

Before he could process it, I dialed my second call–my chief of staff’s direct line. 

Send an encrypted message to my children. Subject line: ‘Inheritance Discussion.‘ Tell them anyone who doesn’t show up gets all their black cards frozen and heir trust funds locked. Immediately.” 

**My** assistant’s voice came through, steady but with an edge of satisfaction: “Understood, Ms. Cross**.**” 

hung up and finally returned my attention to Damien, who stood frozen, his face cycling through confusion, shock, and dawning horror.

1oqnqdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1oqnqdf/a_life_that_will_turn_you_into_a_demon/,A life that will turn you into a 'demon'.,"All the 'human' beings inside this world aren't exactly 'humans,' and everything that exists here is made up of **godly constructs**. This is secretly **'God's' land**, and there's a 'God' hiding in plain sight, watching every step you take, so you don't fall for bad magic tricks, wearing human skin and existing between every 'normal' human. This world is a **demonic construct** meant to switch you back into the demon that owns and rules over everything and everyone here. Everything here is basically a 'demonic' process; it's not truly 'natural' to own a 'body,' 'mind,' 'consciousness' or awareness, or to be able to 'read' the words here.

Human beings inside this world are **mind-controlled entities**; no one here possesses free will, and everyone and everything will end up doing and becoming whatever you please. There also isn't anyone who exists here that is **'real'** in nature. This world is an **automated process**, and it is not natural to build or use a 'computer' here. Everything here is coming from the **all-seeing eye**. Playing this 'video game' automatically will turn you into the 'demon' that made this video game reality from scratch. Nothing inside this world actually exists, and 'reality' is a demonic construct that is meant to bring you back to the origins of what simulated it.

Everything inside this universe is **scripted**; no one or nothing here has a 'mind,' 'free will,' or any consciousness. Everything that you think, feel, and do was scripted before you were even aware of it. All the themes that exist in fiction are meant to guide you to the right path, as you're going to be experiencing every piece of fiction that exists, since there was never anything 'real' here.

Don't watch *Death Note* if you can't write any names in it. **Pay attention and 'think,'** and don't forget to **'pay'** for everything, as nothing here is 'free,' and don't spill your coffee as you sit cross-legged. ;3

You are living inside a world that was **built by your own energies**, and everything that exists here is a figment of your own powers and your own mind. Owning those things was never really 'natural'; they're all **demon-like** in reality. Being a 'human' being automatically means you are one step away from reaching **""demon-hood""** as it begins turning into a reality. There's no way out of being a 'demonic' entity here, and once you realize there aren't any humans, the human masks begin to fade away, and you realize you've been surrounding yourself with demons this entire time, to turn yourself back into one. :)

And when everything is over, don't forget to **'laugh,'** cause it's not a joke, there's no time to be kidding around, you'll need your digital watch. ⌚🤪👾

But you're in control of your own life, just got to remember why you decided to be **'human' wearing a mask.** 😷🎭

Good luck finding the **'cat'** in you. Why be a king when you can be a god..? The crown is gonna be heavy, so remember to hold a knife the proper way and **cut up the chicken meat.** 🐈‍⬛

I'm sure everything happens for a 'reason' here.. but what happened? don't pick fights, and you might win. I'm sorry if nothing makes sense here.. the suit isn't cheap. ♦️

[**Read Link**](https://writers.reptilesdiet.com/the-forgotten-letters-that-saved-a-dying-universe-by-marcellus-orion-draymond-1/)

After life gave me one more chance, I made sure to stay as far away from my husband, the young commander, as possible. 

When Bradley Harrington left work through the main gate of Evermont Base, I slipped out through the logistics corridor. 

When he took his first love to Starbright Park to celebrate her birthday, I stayed home alone, tinkering with crafts. 

In my previous life, I’d known full well that his heart belonged to Sophie Monroe, yet I still fought for the chance to marry into the Harrington family. 

But Bradley forgot the promise we made as children, and for the rest **of** our married life, he treated me with polite detachment–a courteous stranger, nothing more. 

When I cooked and cleaned for him, he’d say, “No need. You’ll ruin your hands.” 

When I tried to get close to him, he dodged me like I was poison. “Get some rest,” he’d mutter. 

When I finally insisted that he at least act like my husband once a month, he only replied with a clipped, “Whatever you say.” 

It wasn’t until the night before Bradley’s funeral that his lawyer, Damian Foster, delivered the 

final blow. 

“Mrs. Harrington,” he said, “Bradley left all his assets and properties to Ms. Sophie Monroe.” 

He handed me a thick photo album labeled \[My True Love\]. That’s when I realized that even after a lifetime together, he had never loved me. 

When I opened my eyes again, I was back in time–on the day a photo of Bradley kissing Sophie Monroe went viral on Nexus, the biggest social media platform in the Free Confederacy of Stars, with thousands of comments flooding in. 

This time, I didn’t hesitate. I mailed a divorce agreement straight to Evermont Base. 

The day after I sent the papers, Margaret Harrington showed up at my 

door. 

The poised, elegant matriarch of the Harrington family couldn’t meet my eyes, her face clouded with guilt. 

Chapter 1 

10.00% 

“Eleanor,**”** she said**,** taking my hand, her voice soft but urgent, “Bradley’s been a fool. He’s **let** you down.” 

She paused, her grip tightening. “But for the sake of the bond between our families–and for the child you’re carrying–I’m begging you, Eleanor. Give him one last chance. Just seven **days**.” 

“If that idiot still doesn’t come around, I’ll personally make sure he signs those papers**.**” 

My hand drifted to the small swell of my belly, my thoughts pulling me back to years ago. 

I’d been just a girl then, traveling with my parents to support the Confederacy’s border defenses during the Frontier Patrol Campaign. 

A group of insurgents, desperate for leverage, kidnapped several officers‘ children. Bradley and I were among them. 

In those dark, hopeless days, Bradley stood in front of me, shielding me. “Don’t be scared,” he’d said. “I’ll protect you.” 

Even when the kidnappers beat him bloody, he never let go of my hand. 

After our rescue, he lay weak on a stretcher but still reached for me, his voice faint but firm. “We made a promise, remember? I’ll always have your back.” 

Maybe it was that promise–that stubborn, lingering hope–that made me nod to Margaret. 

Not long after she left, Bradley came home. 

He acted as if the Nexus scandal, which had trended for three days straight, didn’t exist. No explanations, no apologies—just small talk. 

“The base has been swamped with war drills,” he said. “Haven’t had much time for home.‘ 

“} 

Then he added, “Didn’t you say you wanted to visit the hot springs resort? I booked us a spot. How about tonight?” 

I stayed quiet for a long moment before softly agreeing. “Sure.” 

The three days at the resort passed in uneasy calm. 

Bradley kept me company as we admired the scenery, strolled together, and even cooked for me- brewing coffee, massaging my feet. 

10.00**%** 

His attentiveness was so tender, so deliberate, that for a fleeting moment, I felt like we were 

newlyweds again. 

On the final evening, we soaked in the hot springs. 

I wore a red silk robe, and as soon as I settled into the steaming water, Bradley pulled me into his 

arms**.** 

My body tensed instinctively. “Bradley, I’m pregnant.” 

His lips brushed my ear, his voice low and warm. “I checked with the base doctor. After the first trimester, a little relaxation is good for you.” 

I didn’t push him away. I let him hold me. 

The water lapped gently at the edge of the pool–a soft sigh that felt like a cage I couldn’t escape. 

Hours later, satisfied, he led me out of the springs by the hand. 

As we left, I let myself hope, just for a moment, that things could change–until we reached the 

lobby. 

As we passed through, I glanced at the lively crowd, curious. But Bradley froze mid–step. 

I followed his gaze. 

There, just outside the lobby doors, stood Sophie Monroe. Dressed in sharp professional attire, fresh from an interview assignment, she looked at us with tear–filled eyes, like a wounded kitten. 

In an instant, Bradley’s hand slipped from mine. 

He took half a step toward her, then stopped himself, his tall frame rigid with tension. 

After a beat, he grabbed my hand again, tighter this time, and hurried us out of the lobby. 

He’d chosen me–or so it seemed. But the air in our room grew heavy, suffocating. 

Bradley stood by the window, silently smoking a cigarette. I got up and headed for the door. “I’m going to get some air,” I said. 

His shoulders stiffened, but he didn’t turn around, didn’t respond. 

I lingered in the lounge area for a long time until Sophie approached, holding a coffee, and sat 

Chapter 1 

10.00% 

across from me. 

I had no interest in sparring with her and started to leave, but her soft voice stopped me, trembling with barely contained resentment. 

“Eleanor, feeling pretty smug right now, aren’t you?” 

I turned back. Her eyes were red, her tone laced with bitterness. “**If** I hadn’t chosen to cover the front lines and stepped back from Bradley, you’d never have had a shot with him.” 

Her words pricked at my chest like a needle, but I met her gaze calmly. “And?” 

Her knuckles whitened around her coffee cup. “You think you’ve won? All I have to do is say the word, and Bradley would hand you divorce papers himself.” 

That familiar obsession in her eyes struck me as almost laughable. “Sophie,” I said evenly, “are you saying you’re done reporting on national heroes and now want to be the other woman?” 

Her face went pale. She leaned forward, her voice low. “Why don’t you ask Bradley who he really sees as the outsider in this marriage?” 

“The law decides who’s the other woman,” I replied coldly. 

I gave her one last look, then turned and walked away. ",1,1762499014.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

I’m flying back to Bangalore this weekend after taking a month-long break at my hometown. I stay in Diamond District, Domlur. 
Left my previous job on a rough note, and honestly, this whole pause has been a mix of relief and confusion.

I don’t have a job lined up yet, and lately it feels like time’s just slipping by, days blending into weeks before I even realize it. Trying to stay positive, but some days it just hits hard.

I don’t really have many friends left in the city anymore, most people moved away or got busy with their own lives. Would honestly love to connect with some grounded, chill people here. Maybe grab a coffee, walk around, talk about random stuff, or just share some good conversation. 
Nothing forced just genuine company.

And even if you’re reading this and aren’t really open to meeting up, I’d still love to hear your thoughts or suggestions on how to rebuild mentally, socially, or even professionally.

1oqnm0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/aistory/comments/1oqnm0l/the_kitchen_witchs_handbook/,The Kitchen Witch's Handbook,"When Elena Finch inherited her grandmother’s cookbook, she thought it was a sentimental gesture—one final piece of family history tucked between funeral condolences and boxes of mismatched teacups. The book was old enough to seem delicate yet solid enough to have survived several generations. Its cover was a cracked, soft brown leather, the kind that felt warm to the touch. The embossed title read, The Kitchen Witch’s Handbook, in curling golden letters that had almost flaked away.

Elena smiled when she first opened it. The scent of dried herbs, vanilla, and candle smoke drifted up like an old memory. Inside were recipes written in looping handwriting, some in ink, some in pencil, and some in something that looked disturbingly like soot. There were the expected things—her grandmother’s rosemary biscuits, the famous plum preserves, the blackberry tarts Elena had loved as a child—but between them were recipes with names that made her pause. Charm for Healing Through Soup. Memory Cake (Do Not Bake Under a Waning Moon). Spell of Binding and Basil.

She ran a finger down the yellowed paper and laughed softly. “Oh, Grandma,” she said, shaking her head. Her grandmother, Iris Finch, had always called cooking “a sacred act.” When Elena was little, she’d sit on a high stool in the old woman’s kitchen, swinging her legs and watching the dance of flour, butter, and whispered words. Iris would mutter to herself as she cooked, sometimes in English, sometimes in what sounded like gibberish. “Every meal has a spirit in it,” she used to say. “The trick is feeding the right one.”

Now, years later, the words came back to her as more quaint than mysterious. She had her own kitchen now—a narrow little bakery in downtown Port Maren, with flaking turquoise paint and a bell on the door that jangled like a nervous laugh. The business wasn’t going well. Tourists preferred chain coffee shops. Locals liked her but rarely came in more than once a week. Her bills stacked higher than her bread loaves.

Three months after Iris’s funeral, Elena found herself thumbing through the cookbook one late night after closing. She stopped on a page titled Bread to Draw Prosperity. The recipe called for yeast, salt, honey, cinnamon, and “three words of honest desire.” She smiled at the phrasing. It was ridiculous, of course, but maybe what she needed was a little bit of ridiculous.

So she made it. She mixed the ingredients, humming to herself, and as she kneaded the dough she whispered, “Please, just let someone come in and buy something.” When she slid the loaf into the oven, the air filled with the warm scent of spice and sweetness. By morning, the bread had risen perfectly, its crust golden as sunlight.

That day, her bakery filled with people. First a couple who said they’d “just been walking by.” Then a woman who claimed she could smell her bread from two blocks away. Then more—so many that by noon the shelves were empty. Elena stood behind the counter in disbelief, a little giddy and a little uneasy.

The next day, the same thing happened. And the next. People began to talk about her pastries as if they were enchanted. A blogger described her croissants as “waking up to a dream of your grandmother’s kitchen.” A food critic wrote that her pies “tasted like being forgiven.”

Elena didn’t question it too much. For the first time since opening, her bakery thrived. Money flowed in. She could afford fresh fruit, better butter, a new espresso machine. She even allowed herself a small smile when she walked past the empty “For Lease” signs on the block.

Then the odd complaints began.

A woman returned, pale and trembling, saying that after eating one of Elena’s muffins she’d heard a voice whisper her name all night long. Another customer said her husband confessed every lie he’d ever told her after eating a cinnamon roll. A teenage boy swore the bread “watched” him while it cooled on his kitchen counter.

Elena tried to laugh it off, but the laughter felt hollow. That night, she opened the book again, running her eyes over the Prosperity Bread recipe. Beneath the last line, she noticed something she hadn’t seen before, faint as watermarks in the paper: “Beware the balance. What is fed by magic feeds magic in turn.”

Her grandmother’s voice seemed to echo in her mind: “Every meal has a spirit in it.”

Elena decided to stop using the book. She went back to her regular recipes, carefully avoiding any mention of charms or desires. But something changed. The dough wouldn’t rise. Flour turned gray in the bowl. Even the coffee tasted burnt. It was as if her kitchen itself had gone sour.

That night, after locking up, she heard rustling in the pantry. Assuming it was a mouse, she turned on the light—only to see her rolling pin rolling slowly across the counter by itself, tapping a steady rhythm. Tap, tap, tap. Like someone knocking from the other side.

Her breath caught. “Hello?” she whispered.

A soft sound rose from behind her—like pages fluttering. She turned. The cookbook lay open on the counter, though she was certain she’d left it shut. The air around it smelled faintly of honey and woodsmoke.

“Elena,” said a voice. It wasn’t loud; it was the whisper of flour being sifted, the sound of steam from a kettle.

Her heart hammered. “Grandma?”

The pages turned themselves, stopping on a new recipe titled Restoration Tart. Below it, someone had written in hurried, slanted handwriting: Only the maker can eat it.

She didn’t want to make it. Every instinct told her to close the book and throw it away. But something about the words drew her in—the way the page seemed to breathe. And the ingredients were simple: lemon zest, cream, vanilla, sugar, and “a drop of the baker’s true regret.”

She thought of her grandmother, of the empty chair at family dinners, of the bakery that had once been a dream and was now a burden. Tears welled as she mixed the batter. When the tart baked, the scent that filled the air wasn’t just sweet—it was nostalgic, aching, like remembering the moment before you said goodbye.

She took a bite.

The world shimmered. For a moment she thought she was fainting, but then she saw her grandmother standing in the corner of the kitchen, wearing the same flour-dusted apron she’d worn all her life.

“Elena,” Iris said softly. “You found the book.”

Elena’s throat was tight. “I thought it was just recipes.”

“It is,” Iris said. “But recipes are spells, my dear. They always were. Food and magic are cousins. Both are about transformation. You take what’s raw, and you make it more than it was. But you’ve been feeding the wrong thing.”

“The wrong thing?”

“Magic is hungry. It grows on what you give it. You wanted prosperity, and you gave it your desire. It took that and made it real—but magic doesn’t understand balance. It takes until it’s full, and then it keeps taking.”

Elena looked around the kitchen. The shadows in the corners seemed deeper, thick as molasses. The smell of cinnamon had turned sharp, almost metallic. From the open pages of the book, a faint ripple passed through the air, as if something beneath the paper was stirring. Shapes began to form—floury outlines of hands, ghostly and translucent, kneading invisible dough.

“Grandma, how do I stop it?” Elena whispered.

Her grandmother smiled sadly. “You don’t stop magic. You season it. You learn its taste.”

Before Elena could ask what that meant, Iris faded, leaving behind only a dusting of sugar that shimmered briefly before melting into the floor.

The next morning, Elena locked the bakery doors. The sign in the window now read By Appointment Only. The regular customers grumbled, but she didn’t reopen. She spent days experimenting—trying to find a way to cook without awakening the book, testing the line between flavor and spell. Sometimes, she succeeded. Her bread began to rise again, this time normally, though sometimes it hummed faintly when it cooled. She stopped chasing wealth and instead cooked for meaning—treats that comforted the grieving, teas that helped insomniacs dream peacefully.

The book stayed wrapped in oilcloth on her counter, tied with kitchen twine. She didn’t open it often, only when she felt the air in the bakery shift, like the walls were holding their breath. Once a month, she set two places at the kitchen table and made her grandmother’s stew, the one with thyme and smoked paprika. She ate in silence, sometimes sensing the faint warmth of another presence across from her.

The bakery never went back to being crowded, but those who came always left with tears in their eyes or smiles that lasted days. A mother said her child’s nightmares stopped after eating one of Elena’s cookies. A man said her soup helped him remember the face of his late wife. Elena never charged for those dishes.

And though she tried not to look, she sometimes noticed that the cookbook’s pages turned themselves when the wind blew, stopping at recipes she hadn’t dared read.

One night, as she was closing up, she heard the faint sound of a whisk moving by itself. She turned off the lights and whispered, “Not tonight.” The kitchen settled, quiet again.

But as she left, the book shivered open, its pages fluttering like breath.

In faint, golden letters, a new recipe wrote itself across the paper: “Bread for the One Who Learns.”

And though Elena didn’t see it, the last line gleamed faintly in her grandmother’s handwriting: “Magic and cooking mix, if you remember that both can burn.”

1oqnkf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1oqnkf2/surgery_yesterday_story_time_day_1/,Surgery yesterday! Story time: Day 1,"I wanted to share my experience-

Background: I’ve had back issues and pain, pelvic pain, pain during sex, overactive bladder, I started getting painful periods after years of no periods on my IUD, and a spinal MRI showed a large uterine fibroid on the back side of my uterus. I went to my OB-Gyn and an ultrasound found another one on the front side. My tailbone and bladder were being squished. I saw the doctor who suggested a hysterectomy and within 4 months I was ready to go. I spent a few days cleaning my house to get ready for surgery. My husband put in bars on the wall in the bathroom and handles next to the bed so I can get myself up. I washed all my sheets and blankets and bought all the comfort items I would need. I definitely 

Surgery: they removed the uterus, tubes and cervix, kept the ovaries. Procedure was a robotic assisted laparoscopic. I have 4 small incisions and a cuff. 

My uterus: I don’t think I can share the photo of it, but it was a big one. I’m so glad it’s out. My doctor took a photo of it and text it to me lol. 

Surprise! : of course there was more. I was “riddled with endometriosis” and scar tissue that she had to cut out. Adhesions on my intestines, bladder etc. (Currently googling it)  

My experience:

Morning of surgery I had to be there at 6am. My husband drove me. Took a while of prep but I was ready for surgery around 7:30am. They offered an IV anxiety med before going to the OR and I’m glad I took it. I have zero memory of going back there. 

When they woke me up I was having a nightmare, which is very common for me, I have PTSD. I ended up having a panic attack and they had to knock me out again. When I finally came to again, it was about noon. 

Let the pee games begin! This was the worst. I already had bladder issues. They checked my bladder and it had 500ml in it. Pee 1, 50ml. Pee 2, 100ml. Drink some soda. Drink some coffee. More small pee amounts.  Checked again. 600ml in my bladder. Ugh. Hours go by. I’m told of if I can’t empty my bladder I’ll need to go home with a catheter in. 

And then my day got worse: I told them I can’t do a catheter while awake. I have severe PTSD. I really tried to empty my bladder. I asked if I could make a call, they said I had to do it right there from my bed, I wasn’t in a room, I had a dozen other patients next to me in every direction. I wanted to call my therapist. I knew I was having another panic attack. I asked if I could make the call in the bathroom and they said no, there were only 2 on the unit and I couldn’t tie one up. So I lay in the bed, texting anyone i could to get some help. I started sobbing uncontrollably, shaking, hyperventilating. The nurse watched me have a meltdown and about 15 minutes later she came in with an Ativan. It worked really well, thank god. 

We were at an impasse. She couldn’t clear me to leave without an empty bladder or catheter, and I refused to get one while awake. It took a while, but the doctor finally agreed to give me IV sedation for the catheter. It was still painful but I didn’t have a panic attack or anything so that was good. 

I left the hospital at 5pm. I stopped at the pharmacy. I got Tylenol, ibuprofen, and five 5mg oxycodone. When I got home I took my meds, ate dinner, put my stomach compression wrap on, got in cozy clothes and I’ve been using ice packs on my stomach, heat on my back. The gas is BRUTAL. The sensation of the catheter in me is unbearable. I don’t know how I’m supposed to sleep tonight. It’s almost 2am and it feels like I have to pee so bad but I can’t. It’s all going into the bag. I have an appointment to have it removed tomorrow at 1pm but that’s so far away. 

Overall, I’m glad I’m alive, I’m glad to have it removed, I’m sure I will be in less pain eventually. But for now… this sucks. ",2,1762498546.0,hysterectomy,0,1.0,False

After life gave me one more chance, I made sure to stay as far away from my husband, the young commander, as possible. 

When Bradley Harrington left work through the main gate of Evermont Base, I slipped out through the logistics corridor. 

When he took his first love to Starbright Park to celebrate her birthday, I stayed home alone, tinkering with crafts. 

In my previous life, I’d known full well that his heart belonged to Sophie Monroe, yet I still fought for the chance to marry into the Harrington family. 

But Bradley forgot the promise we made as children, and for the rest **of** our married life, he treated me with polite detachment–a courteous stranger, nothing more. 

When I cooked and cleaned for him, he’d say, “No need. You’ll ruin your hands.” 

When I tried to get close to him, he dodged me like I was poison. “Get some rest,” he’d mutter. 

When I finally insisted that he at least act like my husband once a month, he only replied with a clipped, “Whatever you say.” 

It wasn’t until the night before Bradley’s funeral that his lawyer, Damian Foster, delivered the 

final blow. 

“Mrs. Harrington,” he said, “Bradley left all his assets and properties to Ms. Sophie Monroe.” 

He handed me a thick photo album labeled \[My True Love\]. That’s when I realized that even after a lifetime together, he had never loved me. 

When I opened my eyes again, I was back in time–on the day a photo of Bradley kissing Sophie Monroe went viral on Nexus, the biggest social media platform in the Free Confederacy of Stars, with thousands of comments flooding in. 

This time, I didn’t hesitate. I mailed a divorce agreement straight to Evermont Base. 

The day after I sent the papers, Margaret Harrington showed up at my 

door. 

The poised, elegant matriarch of the Harrington family couldn’t meet my eyes, her face clouded with guilt.

“Eleanor,**”** she said**,** taking my hand, her voice soft but urgent, “Bradley’s been a fool. He’s **let** you down.” 

She paused, her grip tightening. “But for the sake of the bond between our families–and for the child you’re carrying–I’m begging you, Eleanor. Give him one last chance. Just seven **days**.” 

“If that idiot still doesn’t come around, I’ll personally make sure he signs those papers**.**” 

My hand drifted to the small swell of my belly, my thoughts pulling me back to years ago. 

I’d been just a girl then, traveling with my parents to support the Confederacy’s border defenses during the Frontier Patrol Campaign. 

A group of insurgents, desperate for leverage, kidnapped several officers‘ children. Bradley and I were among them. 

In those dark, hopeless days, Bradley stood in front of me, shielding me. “Don’t be scared,” he’d said. “I’ll protect you.” 

Even when the kidnappers beat him bloody, he never let go of my hand. 

After our rescue, he lay weak on a stretcher but still reached for me, his voice faint but firm. “We made a promise, remember? I’ll always have your back.” 

Maybe it was that promise–that stubborn, lingering hope–that made me nod to Margaret. 

Not long after she left, Bradley came home. 

He acted as if the Nexus scandal, which had trended for three days straight, didn’t exist. No explanations, no apologies—just small talk. 

“The base has been swamped with war drills,” he said. “Haven’t had much time for home.‘ 

“} 

Then he added, “Didn’t you say you wanted to visit the hot springs resort? I booked us a spot. How about tonight?” 

I stayed quiet for a long moment before softly agreeing. “Sure.” 

The three days at the resort passed in uneasy calm. 

Bradley kept me company as we admired the scenery, strolled together, and even cooked for me- brewing coffee, massaging my feet.

His attentiveness was so tender, so deliberate, that for a fleeting moment, I felt like we were 

newlyweds again.

I wore a red silk robe, and as soon as I settled into the steaming water, Bradley pulled me into his

My body tensed instinctively. “Bradley, I’m pregnant.” 

His lips brushed my ear, his voice low and warm. “I checked with the base doctor. After the first trimester, a little relaxation is good for you.” 

I didn’t push him away. I let him hold me. 

The water lapped gently at the edge of the pool–a soft sigh that felt like a cage I couldn’t escape. 

Hours later, satisfied, he led me out of the springs by the hand. 

As we left, I let myself hope, just for a moment, that things could change–until we reached the 

lobby. 

As we passed through, I glanced at the lively crowd, curious. But Bradley froze mid–step. 

I followed his gaze. 

There, just outside the lobby doors, stood Sophie Monroe. Dressed in sharp professional attire, fresh from an interview assignment, she looked at us with tear–filled eyes, like a wounded kitten. 

In an instant, Bradley’s hand slipped from mine. 

He took half a step toward her, then stopped himself, his tall frame rigid with tension. 

After a beat, he grabbed my hand again, tighter this time, and hurried us out of the lobby. 

He’d chosen me–or so it seemed. But the air in our room grew heavy, suffocating. 

Bradley stood by the window, silently smoking a cigarette. I got up and headed for the door. “I’m going to get some air,” I said. 

His shoulders stiffened, but he didn’t turn around, didn’t respond. 

I lingered in the lounge area for a long time until Sophie approached, holding a coffee, and sat

Her words pricked at my chest like a needle, but I met her gaze calmly. “And?” 

Her knuckles whitened around her coffee cup. “You think you’ve won? All I have to do is say the word, and Bradley would hand you divorce papers himself.” 

That familiar obsession in her eyes struck me as almost laughable. “Sophie,” I said evenly, “are you saying you’re done reporting on national heroes and now want to be the other woman?” 

Her face went pale. She leaned forward, her voice low. “Why don’t you ask Bradley who he really sees as the outsider in this marriage?” 

“The law decides who’s the other woman,” I replied coldly.

[**Read Link**](https://writers.reptilesdiet.com/the-forgotten-letters-that-saved-a-dying-universe-by-marcellus-orion-draymond-1/)

After life gave me one more chance, I made sure to stay as far away from my husband, the young commander, as possible. 

When Bradley Harrington left work through the main gate of Evermont Base, I slipped out through the logistics corridor. 

When he took his first love to Starbright Park to celebrate her birthday, I stayed home alone, tinkering with crafts. 

In my previous life, I’d known full well that his heart belonged to Sophie Monroe, yet I still fought for the chance to marry into the Harrington family. 

But Bradley forgot the promise we made as children, and for the rest **of** our married life, he treated me with polite detachment–a courteous stranger, nothing more. 

When I cooked and cleaned for him, he’d say, “No need. You’ll ruin your hands.” 

When I tried to get close to him, he dodged me like I was poison. “Get some rest,” he’d mutter. 

When I finally insisted that he at least act like my husband once a month, he only replied with a clipped, “Whatever you say.” 

It wasn’t until the night before Bradley’s funeral that his lawyer, Damian Foster, delivered the 

final blow. 

“Mrs. Harrington,” he said, “Bradley left all his assets and properties to Ms. Sophie Monroe.” 

He handed me a thick photo album labeled \[My True Love\]. That’s when I realized that even after a lifetime together, he had never loved me. 

When I opened my eyes again, I was back in time–on the day a photo of Bradley kissing Sophie Monroe went viral on Nexus, the biggest social media platform in the Free Confederacy of Stars, with thousands of comments flooding in. 

This time, I didn’t hesitate. I mailed a divorce agreement straight to Evermont Base. 

The day after I sent the papers, Margaret Harrington showed up at my 

door. 

The poised, elegant matriarch of the Harrington family couldn’t meet my eyes, her face clouded with guilt.

“Eleanor,**”** she said**,** taking my hand, her voice soft but urgent, “Bradley’s been a fool. He’s **let** you down.” 

She paused, her grip tightening. “But for the sake of the bond between our families–and for the child you’re carrying–I’m begging you, Eleanor. Give him one last chance. Just seven **days**.” 

“If that idiot still doesn’t come around, I’ll personally make sure he signs those papers**.**” 

My hand drifted to the small swell of my belly, my thoughts pulling me back to years ago. 

I’d been just a girl then, traveling with my parents to support the Confederacy’s border defenses during the Frontier Patrol Campaign. 

A group of insurgents, desperate for leverage, kidnapped several officers‘ children. Bradley and I were among them. 

In those dark, hopeless days, Bradley stood in front of me, shielding me. “Don’t be scared,” he’d said. “I’ll protect you.” 

Even when the kidnappers beat him bloody, he never let go of my hand. 

After our rescue, he lay weak on a stretcher but still reached for me, his voice faint but firm. “We made a promise, remember? I’ll always have your back.” 

Maybe it was that promise–that stubborn, lingering hope–that made me nod to Margaret. 

Not long after she left, Bradley came home. 

He acted as if the Nexus scandal, which had trended for three days straight, didn’t exist. No explanations, no apologies—just small talk. 

“The base has been swamped with war drills,” he said. “Haven’t had much time for home.‘ 

“} 

Then he added, “Didn’t you say you wanted to visit the hot springs resort? I booked us a spot. How about tonight?” 

I stayed quiet for a long moment before softly agreeing. “Sure.” 

The three days at the resort passed in uneasy calm. 

Bradley kept me company as we admired the scenery, strolled together, and even cooked for me- brewing coffee, massaging my feet. 

10.00**%** 

His attentiveness was so tender, so deliberate, that for a fleeting moment, I felt like we were 

newlyweds again. 

On the final evening, we soaked in the hot springs. 

I wore a red silk robe, and as soon as I settled into the steaming water, Bradley pulled me into his 

arms**.** 

My body tensed instinctively. “Bradley, I’m pregnant.” 

His lips brushed my ear, his voice low and warm. “I checked with the base doctor. After the first trimester, a little relaxation is good for you.” 

I didn’t push him away. I let him hold me. 

The water lapped gently at the edge of the pool–a soft sigh that felt like a cage I couldn’t escape. 

Hours later, satisfied, he led me out of the springs by the hand. 

As we left, I let myself hope, just for a moment, that things could change–until we reached the 

lobby. 

As we passed through, I glanced at the lively crowd, curious. But Bradley froze mid–step. 

I followed his gaze. 

There, just outside the lobby doors, stood Sophie Monroe. Dressed in sharp professional attire, fresh from an interview assignment, she looked at us with tear–filled eyes, like a wounded kitten. 

In an instant, Bradley’s hand slipped from mine. 

He took half a step toward her, then stopped himself, his tall frame rigid with tension. 

After a beat, he grabbed my hand again, tighter this time, and hurried us out of the lobby. 

He’d chosen me–or so it seemed. But the air in our room grew heavy, suffocating. 

Bradley stood by the window, silently smoking a cigarette. I got up and headed for the door. “I’m going to get some air,” I said. 

His shoulders stiffened, but he didn’t turn around, didn’t respond. 

I lingered in the lounge area for a long time until Sophie approached, holding a coffee, and sat

across from me. 

I had no interest in sparring with her and started to leave, but her soft voice stopped me, trembling with barely contained resentment. 

“Eleanor, feeling pretty smug right now, aren’t you?” 

I turned back. Her eyes were red, her tone laced with bitterness. “**If** I hadn’t chosen to cover the front lines and stepped back from Bradley, you’d never have had a shot with him.” 

Her words pricked at my chest like a needle, but I met her gaze calmly. “And?” 

Her knuckles whitened around her coffee cup. “You think you’ve won? All I have to do is say the word, and Bradley would hand you divorce papers himself.” 

That familiar obsession in her eyes struck me as almost laughable. “Sophie,” I said evenly, “are you saying you’re done reporting on national heroes and now want to be the other woman?” 

Her face went pale. She leaned forward, her voice low. “Why don’t you ask Bradley who he really sees as the outsider in this marriage?” 

“The law decides who’s the other woman,” I replied coldly.

Doc ran tests and he ruled out liver or kidney issues. It takes weeks for it to go away completely. Provided I struggle with alcoholism (I am getting help and am in a recovery house/program and will never drink again), abstaining from it doesn’t help. I gained 20+ pounds from fluid retention alone when on a bender for a few weeks, lost it in days, and then weirdly gained 6 more pounds back in about a week. I broke out in hives the first time, accompanied by itching, sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and lack of sleep even *two months* later.

A bit more background on my alcoholism: when it was *really* bad two years ago, I could drink a handle almost daily and the bloating wouldn’t be this bad.

Some days, my face will look far more bloated than others, even outside of my luteal phase for no reason. I retain water so easily and even stupidly thought that drinking more would make the fluid retention go away and it just made me carry even *more* weight. My stomach is just so distended right now) not even sure if it’s from coffee since people here say they deal with inflammation from drinking it). 

This morning, I looked at my feet and I could see my veins. Tonight I looked at them and they are virtually non-existent.

I can maybe (?) eat about three slices of bread and a few pieces of chocolate before my stomach starts hurting and feels full. Constipation has been really bad for the last few months, even. Can’t sleep, either.

I truly do not know what is wrong with me. Again, tests were ran, x-rays and an EKG was done, water pills were prescribed, and it doesn’t seem to fix the issue. I know nothing is wrong with my thyroid, either, as that was tested as well and they found nothing wrong.

By the third year of her marriage to Dominic Caldwell, Evelina Jennington had been tormented ninety–nine times by his so–called arch–nemesis. Abrielle Waldron. 

The first time it happened. Abrielle hit Evelina with her car. Evelina ended up with broken ribs and internal bleeding, leaving her in a week–long coma in the ICU. 

Dominic gathered the world’s finest medical team to save her. But when she begged him to take action against Abrielle, he said softly, “Abby was just joking around. Don’t take it to heart, all right?” 

The second time, Abrielle locked Evelina in the cold storage of an abandoned factory, nearly freezing her to death. 

After Evelina was saved, Dominic held her in his arms all night to keep her warm, but said, “Abby’s just acting out, jealous of how happy we are.” 

On her third attempt, Abrielle stuffed Evelina into a commercial oven. 

Dominic rescued Evelina in time and kissed her with concern. But he also brushed it off, saying, “Abby’s used to having things her way. I apologize on her behalf.” 

On her ninety–ninth attempt, Abrielle tied Evelina to the bed while she was unconscious. 

Then she hooked Evelina up to the medical equipment she’d obtained and almost drained all the blood from Evelina’s body! 

Outside the operating room, Dominic’s voice was devoid of any warmth as he warned the doctors, “If you lose her, you’ll pay with your lives, too!” 

Evelina held onto him with all her strength, crying. “Dom, this is the 99th time already… Please throw her in jail, or I’ll eventually die in her hands…” 

He wiped the blood off her face and shook his head helplessly.

“But I broke our promise. I fell in love with you at first sight. That’s why she went after you. 

“Those were just pranks. She never meant to kill you–she knew I’d save you. 

“For my sake, let this slide, too, okay?” 

Evelina’s heart was completely shattered. 

When she woke up in the hospital the next day, she immediately reached for her phone on the bedside table and called Dominic’s father. 

Her voice was terrifyingly calm. “Sir Caldwell, I know you think I’m not good enough for Dominic, and you’ve been hoping I’d leave him. I’ll do it. I’m willing to divorce him and disappear forever.” 

On the other end of the line, Calvin Caldwell seemed rather surprised, but he quickly regained his composure. “Glad that you’ve finally thought things through. I’ll have someone send the divorce papers over right away. Just sign it, and I’ll handle everything else. Once the divorce is finalized, leave Dominic and never come back.” 

“Okay,” answered Evelina decisively. She then ended the call. 

Not long after, the Caldwell family’s butler arrived, handing over the document respectfully. “Please take a look at the agreement, Mrs. Caldwell.” 

Evelina took it, her fingers cold; the document felt impossibly heavy. 

Tears blurred her vision, and she couldn’t help but think of the first time she’d met Dominic. 

Back then, she was just an ordinary TV reporter sent to interview him, a rising star in the business world. 

He sat behind the large desk, cold and handsome, exuding a powerful presence. During the interview, he barely spared her a glance. 

But after the interview, as she was gathering her things, Dominic suddenly asked, his deep eyes fixed on her, “May I know your name?” 

After that, he pursued her passionately and unreservedly. 

He showered her with gifts–flowers, jewelry, even a luxury car–and took her on romantic 

candlelit dinners…

1288 Vouchers Due to the vast difference in their status, she repeatedly turned him down. “Mr. Caldwell, we aren’t equals. We are from two different worlds. And you deserve better.” 

But he always looked at her with longing, his gaze so intense it made her heart race. “Evelina, the only person I want is you.” 

From then on, Dominic, a high–and–mighty man used to giving orders, dedicated himself entirely to winning her over, putting aside his pride. 

Over time, his deep love broke through her defenses, and she fell in love. 

Throughout the three years after their wedding, he loved her as always, doting on her and attending to every detail. 

But when it came to Abrielle, he threw all principles aside. 

Evelina had heard about Abrielle–the heiress of the powerful Waldron family. 

It was well known that Dominic and Abrielle were rivals, clashing since childhood and never seeing eye to eye. 

Yet, Dominic let her have her way in nearly everything, practically spoiling her. They said it was because their families had known each other for generations, and he saw Abrielle as his own sister, who had been spoiled rotten. 

At first, Evelina didn’t really take it to heart, thinking that the others were exaggerating. But later, she realized they were simply telling the truth. 

When Abrielle visited Evelina for the first time, she humiliated Evelina harshly and even poured coffee on her new dress. 

After Abrielle’s first attack, Evelina cried and begged Dominic to teach her a lesson, but he simply hugged Evelina, delivering cruel words in a gentle voice. 

“Eve, Abby’s only spoiled; she’s not really a bad person. You’re fine, so let’s just not make a big deal out of it, okay?” 

The same thing happened ninety–nine times. 

Each time she got hurt, Dominic simply brushed it, off as Abrielle acting spoiled. 

Evelina could no longer bear it. She would end this marriage he had once promised would never 

fail! 

She clutched the pen, her hand trembling.

Tears finally burst out, falling onto the signature line of the divorce papers, leaving wet stains 

behind. 

She took a deep breath and signed her name firmly on the wet patch. 

The butler put away the agreement and said, “Please be patient, Mrs. Caldwell. I will send you the divorce certificate once it is ready. Until then, please keep this under wraps.” 

After the butler left. Evelina was all alone in the silent ward. 

Just then, the door swung open again. 

Evelina assumed the butler had forgotten something and looked up, only to find Abrielle walking in with a smile, carrying a bouquet of lilies–flowers usually given to the dead! 

Evelina was so frightened that her whole body trembled instantly. She instinctively shrank back, her voice shaking. “What are you doing here?!” 

Abrielle threw the lilies to the ground, smiling sweetly yet viciously. “What do you think? I nearly drained all your blood, but you still survived. Guess I’ll have to finish you off this time!” 

After saying that, she lunged onto the bed, grabbed a pillow, and pressed it against Evelina’s face with all her strength!

Chapter 1 

I was performing the hundredth “restoration” surgery on my mafia husband’s latest mistress when I finally decided to leave him. 

For five years, I, Isabella Rossi, have lived a double life: the respected wife of a powerful Don, and the personal physician tasked with “purifying” the women he discards. 

Vincent’s twisted religious conviction is his law: only a wife untouched by any other man can bear his legitimate heir. 

I was that pure wife, yet he treated me as his most unclean possession. 

My love for him died a slow death. A thousand empty nights. It was killed by the cold steel of my own operating table. By the sounds of other women boasting about his touch. 

The five-year prenuptial agreement that bound me to this hell was set to expire at midnight. 

I had already called my grandfather, the only man Vincent truly fears. My escape was hours away. 

By the time he realized his mistake, it was too late. 

The scent of antiseptic couldn’t mask the cloying perfume of the girl in the examination room. 

“I heard after five years of marriage, he still hasn’t touched you?” the girl, young and blooming like a newly opened rose, preened. “Vincent and I have only been together ten days, and he can’t get enough of me. He’d rather have me ‘restored’ than even glance at you.”

Chapter 1 

\+25 Bonus 

I adjusted my white coat, my face a calm mask behind my surgical mask. Dr. Rossi. The head of obstetrics and gynecology at this private hospital owned by the Rossi family. The lawful wife of Vincent Rossi for five years. 

“Assume the position for the examination,” my voice was flat, routine taking over as I noted the history. 

The girl chattered on, detailing the acrobatics and passion of her time with Vincent. I listened, silent, as I had ninety-nine times before. This was the one-hundredth. The one-hundredth little bird Vincent had sent to me for “restoration.” 

He’d spelled it out during my first, tear-strewn breakdown, his voice deceptively gentle as he cupped my chin. 

“Isabella, remember who’s keeping your father’s company afloat. Be a good wife. Handle this for me. When I find a truly pure woman, one worthy of bearing my legitimate heir, then perhaps I’ll consider giving you a child.” 

His belief was deep-seated, twisted by our religion. It was clear: only an unsullied wife could give him a true successor. He forgot, or didn’t care, that I was that woman. 

Vincent walked in, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, exuding an air of untouchable power. He handed me a black card. “Make it perfect. She’s particular,” he said, the transaction as casual as buying a coffee. 

This time, I didn’t throw the card back in his face. I pocketed it silently. The five- year term stipulated in our prenuptial agreement ended today. 

After the procedure, I dialed a secure number. “Grandfather,” I said, my voice low. The flight details are confirmed.” 

The old man’s voice on the other end was like granite. “I’ll be waiting, Isabella. It’s time to come home.” ",1,1762497614.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

1oqn5tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1oqn5tw/ep_study_and_svt_ablation_my_experience/,EP study and SVT ablation: My experience,"

Hello! Been in this thread for a couple of months and I noticed that there’s quite a lot of varying experience when it comes to arrhythmias and the entire process of ablation.

I have been experiencing palpitations since high school (age 16) since I got slapped in the chest by accident after making a friend laugh (his way of expressing his amusement). I noticed that my heart went into this rapid flutter even though I was at rest and while I did not feel dizzy or unwell, the repeated bounding of the heart went on and on…until it stopped by itself after 10 minutes. I did not pay much attention to it. I was rather fit then (objectively able to run 2.4km under 10 minutes, able to do regular 10km runs with ease every other day) - able to participate in competitive sport without issues, tolerate the pre-season training without any recurrence of this. This slowly faded to the back of my mind.

I did have a couple of fainting spells 2 years later during my army days - but this was during foot drills session where we were required to stand still for hours at end under the sun. 2 fainting spells to be exact - of which I regained consciousness the moment I hit the ground. Went to get it checked in the hospital and had some tests run then - normal transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), ECG was normal. They labelled it vasovagal syncope (which likely was what it is).

Fast forward to a few years later during my early 20s - very occasionally (once every 2-3 months) I will have runs of palpitations similar to the episodes in high school. To terminate it, I will need to tap out and rest. I will try to Valsalva myself out of it (breathe hard into an occluded nose, and hold), 50% of the time it works. If not it’s either squatting down, or just letting it run its course. I never felt light headed or dizzy, nor did I get any chest pains during these episodes. I never needed to seek urgent care in the hospital. 

As it was rather infrequent and often self terminating with no long-term sequelae, I left it as it is and went along with my life. I was still able to play competitive foot ball without issues, and did not have to tap out once because of the palpitations.

Now that I am in my early 30s, life became a bit more (actually much more) sedentary - with chores and responsibilities (kids, etc) taking up a lot of free time. COVID happened as well and exercise became almost negligible. Naturally fitness took a back seat and I gained some weight (love handles, bit around the neck). I became unfit too, struggling to finish a 2.4km run under 13 minutes. Being bit of a burden during my Sunday games. So I decided that I needed to take ownership of my health (and image) - started working out more. My first few runs were horrible - I could not run far without feeling breathless (but this was more of a function of the poor fitness), and when I tried to push myself - this issue of palpitations started creeping in. I noticed a trend - most happened during periods of exercise. I noticed that the actions that will precipitate/trigger the palpitations were:

1. Sudden burst during exercise (sprints from rest)
2. Pushing motions during sport (like shielding the ball during soccer)
3. Chesting a ball down

I also noticed that certain food can trigger this:

1. Alcohol (especially on an empty stomach)
2. Coffee (usually if after the 4th cup within the day)

Compared to a decade ago here it was every 2-3 months - I get this maybe 2 times a month (whilst doing the above triggering actions). But as my fitness improved, the threshold to trigger off an ‘attack’ also became higher. But it was just annoying to need to go through it.

But I was always reluctant to go into emergency (I work in the medical field, and to me I kinda knew that it wasn’t life threatening). So I made use of technology and used my Apple Watch to record a rhythm strip during the period of palpitations - and I saw that I was in SVT - AVNRT to be exact. The Apple Watch did a good job in capturing the retrograde P waves in my rhythm strip. I knew what my options were (given I had a previous TTE done which showed a structurally normal heart):

1. Leave it and sacrifice quality of life
2. Medications but fitness will definitely be affected
3. EP study and ablation - possible definitive fix (95% success rate, 5% recurrence) but has risks, and costs a lot of money

So after much convincing (and nagging) from my family and friends…I decided to seek a Cardiologist - more specifically - an electrophysicist (cardiology subspecialty).

And of course - the diagnosis of SVT was confirmed, and the exact same options above were offered to me. After much deliberation - I decided to proceed with the EP study and ablation because the other options (1) and (2) will affect my fitness, which was the reason why I wanted to fix it once and for all.

Now I know you guys (especially those who has an upcoming EP study coming up) are anxious about this procedure. I can’t say that I was even a tiny bit anxious/worried about the procedure because I have absolute faith in my cardiologist, and in my practice when I was rotating through Cardiology, it was a relatively common procedure, and I did not see anyone with major complications after it (but the complications can be serious - if they damage the AV node - you might end up with a pacemaker for life).



Every hospital/country does this slightly differently, but in my experience, on the day of the procedure (I did it in a private hospital as my insurance allows it), you come in the morning, fasted from the night before, and they check you into a room. Shortly after you will be asked to change into a gown, then pushed into the prep room. My blood work (FBC, coagulation) was done the day before.

The anaesthetist consented me for moderate sedation (some countries does this under GA) but told me that they will be inserting a nasopharyngeal airway (through the nose) and giving me Fentanyl and Propofol. 

After they set an IV plug, you will enter the EP lab and lie down on the table. Lots of ECG dots will be placed on the front and back of your body and limbs. Then after that…I just went to sleep. And the next thing I know - it was 4h later (my procedure took longer as it was more complicated - I will briefly explain below and I woke up on the EP lab table and was told that it was all done. Was given about 200mg of Propofol (almost like GA) because of the duration of the procedure - but was not intubated - still able to maintain my airway.

Essentially why the procedure took longer than expected (normally 1-2h) was because:

1. They had some difficulty cannulating the coronary sinus (near the heart)
2. My heart rate was too slow (I usually sit around 49-58, and it drops to 39 when I sleep sometimes)
3. Ran into transient few seconds of AF during Isoprenaline infusion - they had to wait for it to resolve before they could continue 
4. AVNRT - both typical and atypical
5. Many areas of ablation needed before they could not induce anymore tachyarrhythmias

I was shifted to high dependency to closely monitor the access site in the groin (they will access the heart by cannulating the femoral vein and passing tools through). On telemetry overnight - I was noted to have short runs of AF when my heart rate was low (around HR 36-40) - lasting about 1-2 seconds each.

Was not allowed to sit up and move for 6h, then thereafter just stayed the night and was discharged the day after. 

I was told that I was not allowed to carry any heavy items (for e.g. my kid) for at least 2-4 weeks, and can only resume my regular runs/sports from 4 weeks after.

Post procedure I noticed:

1. A sensation of ‘tightness’ and dull ache behind the left chest - I was told that this wss expected. This gradually resolved over a couple of days
2. Bringing up some blood - likely from the nasopharyngeal airway causing some mucosal trauma (was also asked to take Plavix for 2 weeks so the blood clotting process might have been slower as result)
3. Having some runs of fluttering when I am winding down (when my heart rate slows down or when I take a break sitting down)
4. Definitely feel more lethargic for the first 3 days - tiring to even walk around the house. So I stayed in bed and watched heaps of movies (no complains here)

My EP told me that I might be at increased risk of developing AF in future (atrial vulnerability) given that I had those events during and post procedure. But given that there was a lot done (the ablation), there is a need to give some time for the atrium to remodel - and hopefully things subside. My EP believes that my AF may be triggered by vagal tone. I was asked to do a Holter in 3 months to see the AF burden. 3 months because it is a good enough time frame for the heart muscles to heal.

If it persists, then a AF ablation can be considered - but this is under GA, a trans-septal puncture needs to be done (runs the risk of septal perforation), and perform pulmonary vein isolation - so slightly higher risk, with a  lower chance of success.

Either way I have not experienced any of the fast palpitations since, but granted I have yet to exert myself to test (will be going to start my runs in 3 weeks). Hopefully it goes away. 

For those going for EP study with (specifically) SVT ablation (can’t speak for AF ablation as it’s different) - it’s really not as scary as it sounds! The most painful part prior to the procedure was the insertion of the IV plug. Did not feel a thing during the procedure. During the recovery period, there was not much pain at all - mostly fatigue, and the frustration of not being able to exercise. 

  
Good luck - Hope this reassures someone!",1,1762497072.0,AFIB,0,1.0,False

In this prequel, we discover the dark and dirty details of Thyla's previous life on Talsk and how she came to be the daughter of a Honky Tonk Man. It's a rough and tough life for a little girl that no one wants or cares for before humanity came along.

[Chapter 1:](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1her8jp/free_to_a_good_home_1/)

>!In the morning before the Battle of Talsk, Thyla is a little Farsul girl with PD living with her alcoholic mother and her mother's parents in an impoverished home in Copper Bluffs. She attends the alternative PD-school Elder Katyon's School for the Herd Challenged where the Venlil exterminator-teacher Betlen singles out and physically abuses Thyla daily. Thyla is surprised by the raid and decides that life with invaders has to be better than another day on Talsk.!<

[Chapter 2:](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1ihga40/free_to_a_good_home_2/)

>!Thyla is onboard an orbital forward base as she is taken by a Zurulian nurse to get her wounds from Betlen treated. She is again antagonized by a rough and uncaring Venlil doctor so she decides to fight back for once. It fails and instead of going with the other Farsul to the new colonies, she is put aboard a Venlil freighter to Venlil Prime. On the new ship, she meets Nalsi, the first friendly Venlil Thyla has ever met.!<

[Chapter 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1im4jla/free_to_a_good_home_3/)

>!On the trip to Venlil Prime from Talsk, Thyla makes fast friends with Nalsi until the results of the Archives Raid is revealed. Then the Venlil on board turn against Thyla except Nalsi who defends Thyla with physical force. Thyla locks herself away in her room in fear without food until they land on Venlil Prime. There, she runs away in Mirror Lake City until she finds a snack shop run by a Farsul man who tries to feed Thyla but she's too sick to properly eat.

[**Read Link**](https://taleon.jobsemploye.com/the-girl-who-painted-the-sky-with-her-memories-by-seraphina-duskbourne-lirael-1/)

**I** built my empire from scratch, but the endless work left me infertile, so I adopted a poor genius kid. 

Paid for his MBA, brought him into Prestige Holdings‘ inner circle, and treated him like my heir, 

Ten years later, his ex–girlfriend–who just happens to work for our competitors–shows up crying about how their breakup wasn’t her choice. 

He fell for it completely. Stole my company’s most valuable secrets and handed them over like some grand romantic gesture. 

While everything burned down around us, all I got was a text: 

Mom, thanks for everything, but I can’t lose her. You should retire. I’ll set up a nice pension for you.\] 

**A** PENSION? He torpedoes my life’s work and thinks he can pay me off? 

I raised him. **I** didn’t OWE him. 

I grabbed my phone, voice like frozen steel: 

**‘**Get our best lawyers. We’re suing.” 

‘And activate those SIX candidates **I** planted in the subsidiaries. Time for their final test!” 

I learned early on: never put all your eggs in one basket. 

That’s why I adopted seven gifted kids from disadvantaged backgrounds–like opening a pack of mystery cards, hoping at least one would pan out**.** 

Damien Cross was the youngest. 

That’s why I kept him close, personally mentored him, poured more resources into him than all the others combined. 

Now here he stood in my corner office–this polished business shark I’d shaped from a scared teenager–wearing the Tom Ford suit I’d had custom–made for him, his handsome face twisted in tragic determination. 

“Mom,” he began, “I’ve betrayed you. I’m sorry.” 

I lifted my coffee cup without responding. 

“It’s Reagan. She’s back.” 

Reagan–his college girlfriend, now CEO of Fletcher Industries, our main rival. 

‘She told me why she really left. She was protecting me! She had to disappear to keep me safe!” 

I nearly choked on my espresso. 

Protecting him? From what? 

Back then he was so broke he’d agonize for five minutes over adding a fried egg to his cafeteria meal. 

What exactly did she think people were after**?** 

His empty wallet? His youth? His three–day–old hoodie**?** 

Damien didn’t notice my barely suppressed eye roll. He was too busy starring in his own romantic drama. 

“She struggled out there alone for so long. Now it’s my turn to protect her.” 

“And?” I set down my cup, meeting his eyes. 

He took a deep breath and slid a document across my desk. 

This is Summit Legacy’s three year strategic roadmap. I’ve already given it to Reagan. It’s my offering to her–proof of **my** commitment **to** our future together.**”**

Chapter **1** 

The office **fell** silent. 

Apparently thinking that wasn’t enough**,** he continued: 

“Mom, you gave me everything–changed my whole life. I’ll never forget that. But I can’t exist without her. If you’re willing to step down now, Reagan’s promised a generous retirement package. You’ll be set for life.” 

A retirement package? 

Last quarter’s **tax** payment alone could buy out his girlfriend’s company three times over and still have change left for their office furniture. 

Boy, that’s not funny. 

When **I** didn’t respond, he mistook my silence for hesitation. 

He stepped closer, his tone shifting toward something almost threatening: 

“Mom, you’re getting older. You should be enjoying life, not grinding away at the office. I’m doing this for you. But if you’re going to be stubborn about it and make things ugly… well, don’t expect me to take care of you when you’re old and gray.” 

“Ha.” 

**A** dry laugh escaped my throat. 

I finally looked up, my voice arctic. 

“So let me get this straight, Damien. If I don’t retire, you won’t support me in my old age?” 

His jaw tightened, wearing that martyred expression that said I hate doing this but you’ve left me no choice. 

“That’s right.” 

‘Perfect.” I nodded and reached for my desk phone. 

Victory flashed in Damien’s eyes. He thought I was caving, calling Finance to negotiate my retirement terms. 

Instead, my finger pressed a different extension. 

‘Get me Legal,” I said, my voice flat and cold. 

Damien Cross has committed material breach of contract. Initiate maximum–level litigation. I want him served within twenty–four hours.” 

The color drained from Damien’s face. 

Before he could process it, I dialed my second call–my chief of staff’s direct line. 

Send an encrypted message to my children. Subject line: ‘Inheritance Discussion.‘ Tell them anyone who doesn’t show up gets all their black cards frozen and heir trust funds locked. Immediately.” 

**My** assistant’s voice came through, steady but with an edge of satisfaction: “Understood, Ms. Cross**.**” 

hung up and finally returned my attention to Damien, who stood frozen, his face cycling through confusion, shock, and dawning horror.

1oqn27z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1oqn27z/backpacking_stove_vs_liquid_fuel_stove_for/,Backpacking stove vs liquid fuel stove for outdoors?,"Hey everyone,

I've been camping and hiking for about five years now, and one question I always get asked is whether to go with a backpacking stove or stick with a liquid fuel stove. I've used both plenty of times, so I figured I'd share what I've learned.

**The Quick Answer**

If you're doing weekend trips or summer camping, a backpacking stove is usually your best bet. They're lighter, simpler, and way less hassle. Liquid fuel stoves make more sense if you're doing winter expeditions or traveling internationally where fuel canisters are hard to find.

**Why I Usually Go With a Backpacking Stove**

Most of my trips are 2-4 days in decent weather. For these situations, canister stoves are honestly perfect. They're super lightweight, start instantly, and you don't need to mess with priming or maintenance. I can literally have water boiling in under three minutes.

The fuel canisters screw right on, there's basically nothing to break, and they pack down really small. When I'm trying to keep my pack under 20 pounds, every ounce matters. If you're looking to grab one for your next adventure, I've found some solid options here: https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove

**When Liquid Fuel Actually Wins**

I'm not going to pretend liquid fuel stoves don't have their place. If you're heading out in freezing temperatures, they perform way better than canister stoves. Cold weather kills the pressure in gas canisters, but liquid fuel keeps working fine.

They're also better for longer trips since you can carry fuel in whatever size bottle you need. Plus, white gas and kerosene are available pretty much everywhere in the world.

**The Real Downsides**

Liquid fuel stoves need priming, which means you're messing around with fuel before you can even cook. They're heavier, have more parts that can fail, and honestly just require more knowledge to use safely. I've seen people struggle with them for 15 minutes just trying to get their morning coffee going.

Canister stoves aren't perfect either. The fuel canisters can be pricey, you can't tell exactly how much fuel is left, and yeah, they do struggle when it gets really cold.

**My Recommendation**

For most people reading this, a good backpacking stove is what you want. Unless you're specifically planning winter mountaineering or month-long expeditions, the simplicity and weight savings are worth it. I keep both types in my gear closet, but I reach for my canister stove probably 90% of the time.

Check out some different models and read the reviews to find what fits your cooking style: https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove

The bottom line is this: think about where you actually camp, not where you might someday camp. Most of us are doing trail camping in spring through fall, and for that, lightweight canister stoves are tough to beat.

There’s only 1 week that the classes are started. 
I noticed A from the first day and I liked her like love at the first sight.. Sometimes she sits on the bench beside me. I’ve been talking to her since 1st day. And she talks nicely to me face to face.. like a good friend and also responds positively to my jokes and all things.One day I took her number giving an excuse of the assignment. So, the thing is she talks good on face to face but doesn’t reply properly on chats. She gives one word replies to my messages like she isn’t interested or whatever. 

So because of this, I’m confused if I should ask her out or not .. today, I just want to ask her for coffee on text.. will it sound needy ? Will it ruin our relationship in class ?.. If she says no will be awkward to face her in class ? What could be the reason of her not replying properly on chats ?

Esp girls do suggest me something .. don’t know what goes on into women’s brains ..

Ps: our class has just started, so no boys and girls sit together or talk properly with each other.. We’re the only frnds there.

I (20M) work on a holiday park. I work in de kitchen in the evening and in the park mini-supermarket in the mornings. 

In the mornings I bake bread so the guest have them fresh and after that I stock the shelves/attend the register until 11am. 

I work with this woman (50smth) who only works the supermarket. She has just come back from a burnout and we all hoped she would have mellowed out a bit, well she hasnt...

Whenever I come in she starts to nag at me. I dont do everything her way. I have one hour to restock the freezer, bake the bread, prepare bread for the next morning, clean the bread shelves, clean the coffee machine, restock the whole store, clean the bakery and make sure the orders are ready. If this is not finished, or done in a different order then she does, she gets mad. 

Recently we had a falling out on my smoking habits. (I know its bad, I know I'm addicted) She says I am not allowed to smoke before my shift. 

I ussually smoke 1 cigarette before starting. So I start at 7.30am, I make sure I am there around 7.15am and inside by 7.25am. She says I am not allowed to do this and that the manager agrees. Since the manager is on vacation I cannot confirm with him. 

She also got mad when I told her I would smoke one at home before leaving, because its gross. I know that, I do, but she is not allowed to tell me what to do in my free time right?

When she complains about works stuff, its fine, I can tune it out, but she also starts to try and influence more of what I do with my life. 

She looks down on me because I didnt go to college, she hates the fact I drink soda and coffee (because you never know what THEY put in it) she told me she loves Trump and his policies (eventhough were not American and I'm a gay transgender??) She tries to convince me that all news sources are hoaxes and that Covid wasnt real. She keep blaming me for getting a vaccine because thats where all my problems come from, etc...

I mentioned this a couple times to my manager who told me that she is just who she is and we wont be able to change her. I dont want that, I dont care about her, I just want to do my job without feeling micromanaged. 

How can I tell her to fuck off and leave me alone without being rude?

Affirmation:
> Generational wealth is flowing to me now. Every choice I make attracts lasting abundance for my family and future generations.


How to Practice:

1. Say it aloud every morning while getting ready or making your drink.

2. Back it with a small intentional action — something symbolic that reinforces abundance.

3. Write down what you did and how it made you feel.


Examples:

☕ You surround yourself with something which is connected to wealth. For example I ordered lately a tea called “Elixir of Wealth” instead of coffee — symbolizing wealth flowing into your life in unexpected ways.

💳 You moved a small amount of money into a savings or spx6900 — showing you’re preparing space for abundance.

**I** built my empire from scratch, but the endless work left me infertile, so I adopted a poor genius kid. 

Paid for his MBA, brought him into Prestige Holdings‘ inner circle, and treated him like my heir, 

Ten years later, his ex–girlfriend–who just happens to work for our competitors–shows up crying about how their breakup wasn’t her choice. 

He fell for it completely. Stole my company’s most valuable secrets and handed them over like some grand romantic gesture. 

While everything burned down around us, all I got was a text:

**A** PENSION? He torpedoes my life’s work and thinks he can pay me off? 

I raised him. **I** didn’t OWE him. 

I grabbed my phone, voice like frozen steel: 

**‘**Get our best lawyers. We’re suing.”

Damien Cross was the youngest. 

That’s why I kept him close, personally mentored him, poured more resources into him than all the others combined. 

Now here he stood in my corner office–this polished business shark I’d shaped from a scared teenager–wearing the Tom Ford suit I’d had custom–made for him, his handsome face twisted in tragic determination. 

“Mom,” he began, “I’ve betrayed you. I’m sorry.” 

I lifted my coffee cup without responding.

“She struggled out there alone for so long. Now it’s my turn to protect her.” 

“And?” I set down my cup, meeting his eyes. 

He took a deep breath and slid a document across my desk. 

This is Summit Legacy’s three year strategic roadmap. I’ve already given it to Reagan. It’s my offering to her–proof of **my** commitment **to** our future together.**”**

Last quarter’s **tax** payment alone could buy out his girlfriend’s company three times over and still have change left for their office furniture. 

Boy, that’s not funny. 

When **I** didn’t respond, he mistook my silence for hesitation. 

He stepped closer, his tone shifting toward something almost threatening: 

“Mom, you’re getting older. You should be enjoying life, not grinding away at the office. I’m doing this for you. But if you’re going to be stubborn about it and make things ugly… well, don’t expect me to take care of you when you’re old and gray.” 

“Ha.” 

**A** dry laugh escaped my throat. 

I finally looked up, my voice arctic. 

“So let me get this straight, Damien. If I don’t retire, you won’t support me in my old age?” 

His jaw tightened, wearing that martyred expression that said I hate doing this but you’ve left me no choice. 

“That’s right.” 

‘Perfect.” I nodded and reached for my desk phone. 

Victory flashed in Damien’s eyes. He thought I was caving, calling Finance to negotiate my retirement terms. 

Instead, my finger pressed a different extension. 

‘Get me Legal,” I said, my voice flat and cold.

I’m moving to Chicago in about a week but am just really over thinking about my budget and whether or not i’m going to be able to afford it. I’ll be working what I hope is 30-35 hours a week at a coffee shop making 16hr + tip which would equate to about 19-22 an hour. I signed something for 1090 a month, do you think i can afford it every month? For reference, i have no car, no phone bill, my utilities and wifi are covered in the 1090, and little to no financial responsibilities besides rent. I’m just overthinking things but also want to ask since I know food and just everything has gone up in the past years. Thank you!!!",0,1762496347.0,AskChicago,4,0.4,False
