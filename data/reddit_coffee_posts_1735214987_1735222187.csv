Opened this a few days ago but have been struggling to get a great cup from it, everything I've made has been pretty lacking in any flavour.

I had been trying just 2 pours (bloom +1 more) so as to not agitate too much since it's an Ethiopian coffee and has been stalling on the drawdown

Typical recipe has been: Plastic Hario V60, Cafec Abaca filters papers, Tesco Ashbeck water at 94-96°C, 15g:250ml, 45s bloom with 45ml water, then pour close to the bed in small circles up to 250ml with a slight 'jiggle' at the end just to make sure the bed is even

I've tried various things in isolation, such as higher/lower temp, grinding finer/coarser (Kingrinder K6 ranging from 80-105 clicks) agitating more while pouring or by swirling and elongating the bloom time. Of these, only elongating the bloom out to 1m30s started to bring out some fruity flavours, but it still wasn't overly clear what the flavours were - had tried a 1m bloom and a 2m bloom, but both were pretty tasteless strangely",1,1735221936.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Vikings have long been romanticized as fierce warriors and skilled seafarers, but there's so much more to their story! Let’s dive into some humorous and lesser-known facts about these Norse adventurers that might just surprise you.

**1. Viking Hygiene: The Original Clean Freaks**

Contrary to the popular image of Vikings as dirty barbarians, they were actually quite obsessed with cleanliness! Archaeological findings suggest that Vikings bathed at least once a week, which was more than many of their contemporaries. They even had grooming kits that included combs, tweezers, and ear spoons. So, next time you picture a Viking, imagine them scrubbing up rather than just scrapping!

**2. The Power of the Puns**

The Norse had a great sense of humor, and their sagas often included clever wordplay and puns. They loved riddles and jokes, proving that even in the midst of battles, Vikings enjoyed a good laugh. Can you imagine a Viking raider pausing mid-sword fight to throw out a pun? Talk about a killer sense of humor!

**3. Drinking Horns: Fashion Over Function?**

Vikings are often depicted drinking from horns, but those horns weren't just for show. While they did use them for drinking, it turns out that they were also a bit impractical. Imagine trying to sip from a pointy horn while on a rocky boat! It’s like drinking from a fancy cup that’s way too hard to hold—stylish, but not very functional.

**4. The ""Viking"" Look: Not What You Think!**

The classic Viking look of long beards and horned helmets? Pure myth! Historians believe that no self-respecting Viking would wear a horned helmet into battle. Those helmets were likely plain and practical. So, the next time you see a Viking in a movie looking all fierce with horns, just remember—they were probably more about practicality than fashion!

**5. Names That Make You Chuckle**

Viking names were often descriptive and sometimes downright funny. For example, there were Norsemen named “Bjorn Ironside” and “Ragnar Lothbrok,” but also “Einar the Bane of His Enemies” and “Harald Hardrada,” which translates to ""Harald the Hard Ruler."" Imagine introducing yourself as “Einar the Bane of His Enemies” at a party—talk about setting the bar high for expectations!

**6. The Viking ""Fart""**

Viking ships were designed to be swift and agile, but they also had a unique issue—farts! With all those warriors packed into small spaces, it’s said that the air on a Viking ship could get pretty stinky. So, if you ever find yourself on a long voyage, just remember: there’s a good chance you’re not the only one bringing the smells!

Vikings were more than just warriors—they were a complex culture with a sense of humor, a penchant for cleanliness, and some surprisingly impractical fashion choices. Next time you think about Vikings, remember these funny quirks that make them relatable and amusing!

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

But since other people’s misfortunes are a chance to learn something, here’s the story. If you don’t want to read it, now’s your chance to bail. Let’s go.

The Backstory:
I’ve been working remotely for about three years, traveling the world and living my dream. Then, in my latest destination, at some casual event, I ran into this guy who is, quite literally, the Supreme Hater of Digital Nomads. He firmly believes we’re a modern plague that destroys local cultures, raises rents, and steals public Wi-Fi. Okay, fine, that’s his opinion, right? The problem is, he’s not content with just hating. He makes it his mission to turn every interaction with a digital nomad into a public humiliation. And I became his perfect target.

The Incident:
We bumped into each other at a café where I was quietly trying to finish a report before my deadline. He figured out I was “one of those nomads” when he saw my “Remote Year” sticker on my laptop. Then the subtle jabs began:
“Working hard or just pretending for Instagram?”
I gave him a weak smile and kept ignoring him. But the guy wouldn’t stop. At one point, he said loudly:
“Funny how you nomads love coming here, but as soon as rents go up for everyone else, you disappear, huh? No commitment, just leeching off everything.”

The entire café started looking at me. My head was already boiling, but I took a deep breath and stayed quiet. Then he hit me with the worst:
“Must be nice living like that, no responsibilities, abandoning your family while pretending to be a global worker. Bet you didn’t even pay for that coffee, just using the free Wi-Fi before you leave.”

Seriously, dude? First off, the Wi-Fi was from the café that I paid for. Second, he doesn’t even know me, and he’s dragging my family into this, as if I’m some kind of bum?

I stood up and calmly said:
“Listen, man, I get that you have some personal issue with remote workers, but can you just leave me alone?”

That’s when he snapped. He slammed the table and shouted:
“You people are the plague of the 21st century! No homes, no roots, and you just screw over the people who actually live here!”

I swear I tried to keep my composure, but then he went for the final blow:
“You shouldn’t even be allowed in places like this. Bet your family is ashamed of you.”

At that moment, I lost it.
“Listen here, pal. You don’t know anything about my life. I worked hard for the freedom I have. I don’t depend on anyone, and unlike you, I don’t go around spreading free hate to everyone who thinks differently.”

He stood up and tried to throw his coffee at me, but it hit the floor instead. I was furious. Chaos broke out. Baristas trying to break it up, people filming, tables flipping. He came at me like a bull, and while I was looking for a way to dodge him, I glanced out the café window and noticed something strange: a giant drone flying low, followed by a massive robot with a mechanical arm holding a weapon. Suddenly, a blinding flash lit up everything. It was the beginning of the age of machines.",0,1735221593.0,digitalnomad,3,0.15,False

1hmow10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hmow10/i_didnt_leave_the_light_on/,I Didn’t Leave the Light On,"I moved into my new apartment two weeks ago. It’s a small, one-bedroom unit on the second floor of an old building downtown. The rent was cheap, and I was eager to get out of my cramped, noisy place. The apartment wasn’t much—worn-out carpets, faded wallpaper, and ancient appliances—but it was mine. Finally, a space to call my own.  
  
The first night I stayed there, I felt strangely uneasy. It wasn’t anything specific—just the sort of nervousness that comes with being in a new, unfamiliar place. But by the time I climbed into bed, I had forgotten all about it. The city outside my window was quiet, and I drifted off quickly.  
  
When I woke up the next morning, the kitchen light was on. I was sure I’d turned it off before I went to bed. In fact, I always double-check the lights when I leave a room. But there it was—bright and glaring, casting a sharp shadow across the counter. I shrugged it off, thinking maybe I was just too tired and had forgotten. The place was old; the wiring probably wasn’t great.  
  
The next night, the bathroom light was on. I hadn’t even been in there before bed. It was as though someone had turned it on in the middle of the night. But I convinced myself it was another oversight on my part. Old building. Faulty wiring. It wasn’t a big deal.  
  
But the pattern continued.  
  
Every night, a different light would be on when I woke up. The living room, the hallway, the bedroom lamp. It was always something. And it was always after I had turned everything off and settled in for the night.  
  
I started to get paranoid. Maybe I wasn’t turning the lights off as carefully as I thought. Maybe I was sleepwalking. I started setting up my phone to record at night, just to see if I could catch anything unusual.  
  
The first time I checked the footage, I was met with a blank screen. No recording at all. I had been charging the phone, so the battery wasn’t an issue. The file was there, but it was completely empty, as though it had never even been turned on.  
  
That’s when I decided to do something about it. The next night, before bed, I unscrewed the bulbs from every light in the apartment. If they couldn’t get power, they couldn’t turn on. I was sure this would fix the problem. I went to bed feeling smug, convinced I had outsmarted whatever was happening.  
  
But the next morning, I woke up to a nightmare.  
  
Every single light was on again.  
  
I shot out of bed, my heart racing, and ran to the living room. The bulbs I had unscrewed the night before? They were screwed back in. And they were all glowing brightly, as if they had never been touched.  
  
But that wasn’t the worst part.  
  
My furniture had been rearranged. The couch, the chairs, even the coffee table—everything was moved. And it wasn’t just haphazardly placed. No, everything was positioned carefully, deliberately, as if someone had spent hours aligning each piece, making sure it faced my bed.  
  
I froze, staring at the scene. My mind raced, trying to make sense of it. But it didn’t.  
  
There, in the middle of the living room floor, was a mirror. One I didn’t own. And in the mirror, written in what looked like dust or ash, were three words:  
  
**“STOP UNSCREWING THEM.”**  
  
That was it. I couldn’t stay here any longer. I grabbed my things, slammed the door behind me, and ran. I’ve been staying at a friend’s place for the past few days, but I can’t shake the feeling that whatever is in that apartment is still following me. The lights are still out of control, and I know it’s only a matter of time before it finds me again.  
  
If you’re reading this and you ever notice the lights turning on when they shouldn’t, don’t ignore it. Don’t go back. Whatever is in the dark is far worse than you can imagine.",1,1735221568.0,nosleep,1,0.6,False

Nice fluffy snow kind. There's no other houses of cabins, just mine with a clear view of the skies. 
It's night time and I'm drinking coffee/hot choco by the sliding door that looks out into the wild. Though it was night time, it's well lit and there's green dancing aurora borealis happening in the night sky. I saw a huge green Chinese dragon flying by and came down to the sliding door, and my husband got scared but I could tell it was friendly. Because it's so big, there was a up draft of wind around it. I started waving at it and it was following my gestures. I opened the sliding door and tried to pet it on its head. It was happy and it flew back up in the skies. It was beautiful. I went out of my cabin and looked up, I saw train tracks in the mid air and there was a train going on it kinda like Santa on his sleigh type deal. The train had stopped so people could enjoy the aurora borealis view and the mountain peak right next to it. Then I woke up ......

1hmotxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1hmotxq/three_years/,Three Years,"Just hit three years and here are some thoughts. I am forever grateful for this amazing loving community and usually stop by once a day. I don't post much but have learned some much from all of you, thank you! This place gives me motivation to stay the course, get inspired by amazing turn-around stories, and also be aware through ""field research"" that things could turn for the worse if I decide to take that first drink again.  Here are some of the positives from three years no booze  :)

Staying the course & one day at a time is key for me. It took probably a bit over two years to start feeling really good consistently and to stop having any cravings for beers/wine. It took way longer than I thought it would for a proper mind/body reset. This was after partying pretty hard for about 30 years. Kind of crazy as I remember waking up one day after two years and some change feeling really good and that feeling is still here thankfully. I finally feel really settled in my own skin at age 48 and have very little to no anxiety. As a baseline I feel really clear headed, well rested & calm even with all of the coffee that I drink! Do your best to make it through one day at a time and stay the course.

Being mindful of the chase. Gosh looking back I used to chase so many things from surfing (a +) throughout the day to partying at night to hunting things on Offer Up & Craigslist super hungover. The hungover chase! Besides consistent daily exercise (surfing & other things) now if I chase anything I chase sleep! My sleep has been a major priority since beginning this journey and it has improved so much that I consistently get good sleep (6-7 hours a night) where's I used to get maybe get two nights a month of quality sleep. Ask yourself if your chasing something positive or negative? Do your best to chase only + things.

Playing the tape forward is another tool that I love and use consistently.  One great thing about getting older is the wisdom that you gain through experience. I love the recklessness of being young and youth culture with the fuck it attitude and just going for things BUT I am looking at living my 2nd half of my life feeling good and doing positive things for my mind and body. Yes I can go out with friends and see live music yes I can have beers if I want but I know by playing the tape forward I would not sleep well & would be hurting in the morning. No bueno. Also, I am at the point now where I am OK and stoked with being able to see live music and just focus 100% on that and not be distracted by drinking. When in doubt play the tape forward and do your best to make it through another day. As I just read this morning here in this community ""No one wakes up in the morning wishing they drank last night"" TRUTH

Being a married Dad to two boys now 15 & 18 I am thankful I stopped drinking when I did. Yes I wish I stopped earlier for sure.  Age 40, I think would have been the sweet spot, ha. Thankfully I never got in trouble with the law, no DUI's, did terrible regretful things, but I was pretty sloshed in front of them a few times.  However, now I am thankful I can be 100% present for them and that I can do my best to model healthy habits and behaviors as they move through their teenage years. 

Hopefully this post will help someone out today and maybe give that little motivation or spark to make it through another day.  You can do it! Just get through today and start the process again tomorrow! Please know that I am thankful for each and everyone of you as you have all helped me make it to where I am today.

1hmot0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1hmot0b/4_star_mods_some_impressions_so_far/,4 Star Mods - Some impressions so far,"So I have been testing different mods on custom since the raid dropped and also on live.  Below is a summary of what I have learned so far myself and also from tests that others have done.   Feel free to add onto it or correct.

**Polished:**  It is bugged.  To get it to work, you need durability to be higher than 100 and less than 190.  Ideally, when you get to 189 durability, you should slap on a +50 Dur and that will stop it from degrading.  If you did it correctly, then polished damage should show up on your stats..

**Conductor:**  Great in theory but in reality, I found it to contributing more to health regen vs AP regen.  It is basically vampires and the AP regen is bugged to 1 ap for 5 secs - not sure how much it stacks. To keep it simple, not worth it vs. say, pin pointer.

**Pin-pointer:** This is great.  Multiplicative damage i.e. 1.5x for regular damage, not crits.  From the description, I think it was meant to be additive 50%.  And heads count as limbs.

**Pyromaniac:** Works as advertised.  Really shines on Holy Fire and Cremator.

**Pounders:**  Broken in a good way as everyone knows.  Scales up to 1000% and in all probability, will be nerfed so use it while you can.  Even after the nerf (not really nerf as they will just bring it back to what the description says), it will be really good........just not overpowered as it is now.

**Reflective:** I have used this one extensively.  In my controversial view, this is a great niche use mod for certain situations but a full reflective set (outside of raids) as a daily driver is a waste in my opinion.  I think the prices being charged for it are ridiculous.  This was the first mod I used on my sets and I was up in arms when turtle marked it as an A tier mod and not an S-tier.  Later on, I find myself agreeing with his conclusions.

For one thing, it is not like ricochet/bullet shield i.e. it doesnt stop you from taking damage.  And for another, deflect aka ricochet/bullet shield damage is boosted based on armor types (200% with PA I believe).  Reflective, reflects a portion of the damage taken by you and boosts seems to be affected by your resistances only (low resistances, less dmg reflected).  I have farmed the robot extensively solo and tested various scenarios.  But the long and short of it is that full reflective without ricochet is slower than just ricochet on it's own for that purpose. With ricochet/bullet shield you can farm the first boss faster vs. on full reflective without these two perks.  Taking one for the team boosts reflective damage and obviously, the fastest would be reflective, ricochet, bullet shield and taking one for the team.

So running with full reflective is only really worth it for raids or solo game scenarios like silos or PVP. You won't find many other scenarios in game where a hard & fast hitting boss is only focused on you exclusively (maybe if you start an event solo on private and then just stand there - but other than ego boost, you won't get any time benefits with or without reflective....no other boss has the perfect factors for this like EN06 solo has). No point against normal enemies as you will delete them before reflective has a chance to do it.

For raids, from a time perspective, 3 pieces of reflective seems to be a good spot against the first boss (no tangible time difference) and frees up two spots for rejuvenator or limit breaking.  For daily driver armor, one piece of reflective would be good enough for getting tags on enemies.

So all in all, it is a good mod but vastly over-rated and over-hyped.  Definitely agree with turtle now on his classification of this to A tier vs. S-tier.

Personally, I am still happy when a reflective drops for me as I know that I can easily do a 2:1 trade for it to get the mods that I want, lol.

**Ranger:** I guess the go to damage booster for normal armor as the choice there is limited.  5% straight damage boost per piece.  Can't go wrong with that.

**Limit breaking:**  Great.  Finally something that can allow full health builds to crit every other shot like bloodied.

**Scanner:** I am not sure about this one.  Whether the display is bugged or it doesn't do anything if you have a weapon with -25% AP cost equipped. In any case, I tested it by number of shots in VATS because of the bugged display but to be honest, there wasn't that much difference with scanner vs. without (3-5 shots at max which does imply AP cost reduction vs. VATS optimized but not to the full extent as written on scanner description - the description implies additive which means I should get double the shots but the effect seems multiplicative).   Could be potentially bugged. Or it is meant to replace the -25% AP on your weapon so you can swap that out for a more useful star like +3 luck.

**Rejuvenator:**  25 AP/25 HP per sec on full stack.  Better than two canned coffees *(one coffee 12 AP per sec over 25 sec for a total of 300)*. And on top, benefits to your team - Hell yes.   This in my opinion is the strongest 4 star mod out there for armor. Just a caveat, I have read somewhere that it is doing regen more than intended and will get fixed.  In any case, there are really good synergies you can achieve with this, instead of going full rejuv e.g. 3 rejuv 2 limit breaking or 3 rejuv and 2 aegis.  I am honestly surprised as to why reflective is so overpriced and rejuvenator is not.

**Aegis:**  This is another good mod for a team support build.  Improves your and your team's survivability.  Personally I wouldn't run full aegis unless another raid comes out which needs a dedicated team buffer / tank.   But good synergy with other mods as described above.

As I said, please feel free to criticize or correct.  Also add your analysis of mods as I haven't gone though all the mods yet.

1hmos9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1hmos9l/trigger_elimination_protocol/,Trigger Elimination Protocol?,"There are numerous posts on diet but has anybody come across an elimination protocol to find all triggers?

I see a lot of posts on different subs that if I do this than I get sick or vice versa. I know from personal experience that finding triggers is very difficult. The golden rule of statistics is that correlation does not mean causation. What is the threshold for statistical significance and how to much do we have to suffer to prove a trigger? As an example, I can flip a coin and get heads five times in a row and that wouldn't be conclusive that I am dealing with a weighted coin. Ten times is very unlikely, and I could then infer that there is something wrong with the coin.

I believe following a strict elimination protocol may be the solution for many of us. Once you find your triggers then maybe you will find a root cause that is treatable. I don't see any help from doctors when we have these mystery illnesses. Standard allergy testing can have false positives and only covers what it covers where we are exposed to millions of things each day.

So just to start to flesh out how we scientifically approach our issues, we need a baseline and build from there. It would consist of 1 week of baseline activity and then add stuff back in from there:

1. Need a safe filtered indoor environment, preferably a small bubble with no mold and no allergens. I have seen some prefab homes online and maybe the cost would be around 30k for a material I would feel comfortable with.
2. A very strict diet. Only five items for the week. I would go with eggs, carrots, peas, lamb, and  mold-free coffee.
3. Only natural cotton materials on the inside. Some may request a different fabric if cotton has been a possible trigger.

After one week, how do you feel? Significantly better? Great, the second week is about adding items back each day.

Edit #1: This is a rinse and repeat for most of us. Once you are back home, you probably will get sick again but now you have a baseline and you can approach it from there by tracking everything. After a period of time, you return to the safe house and start where you ended on the second week. ",1,1735221213.0,MCAS,1,1.0,False

And it’s making things really difficult. What do I say or do?,"This may make me sound like an asshole, but I feel like I’m wasting my life away. I live her to death (and have no interest in leaving), but my days feel consistently wasted. If she doesn’t go on a day trip to her family’s or her friends, I can chalk up my day as a wasted day. I’ll give an example. 

I am very much a planner, and very intentional with my time. With my 8-5 job, my free time feels very sparse. So when the weekend or holiday comes around, I am very diligent. The moment I wake up it’s like I’m off to the races. I eat and immediately get into chore mode. Typically, by noon or 1, I finished all I set out to do and can enjoy my day. I’ll play games, or watch football, or work on a side hustle project. And there is so much day time left I can usually get 5-6 activities in and still be tired by nighttime when I’m ready to just watch mind numbing tv and settle down. 

My day feels great, I accomplished everything, feel productive, and got to enjoy myself. 

Here are my days now. 

I wake up let’s say at 8, and if I’m home we like to go grab breakfast, which I love. I get up at and get dressed and go to wait. She’s up at 9:30 sits on her phone for a while, maybe up to an hour, gets dressed and walks down. It’s 10:30 and she starts a coffee and sits in her robe on the couch. The whole time I have been in “we are leaving any second mode” so I don’t do anything. Maybe I’ll do a small chore like dishes. But no big chore and no recreation. 

We leave at 11:15, go eat and are back around 12:30. It’s time for me to eat lunch, but I just ate breakfast. She goes to sit down before she starts her day and feels bad if I just leave her. If I stay, we sit and hang out on the couch for an hour or so. It’s nearly 2 and she starts chore mode. We work until 5-6, and get ready for dinner. 

I’m now itching to do my activities, and she feels we have been busy all day and now wants to spend time with me. If I put up no resistance we watch a mindless show until she goes to bed. If I resist and do my own thing she feels like I’m ignoring her. 

But my day that was efficient to the second has now been reduced to waiting around to finally get the pleasure to not do anything come evening time. And I love her, and this isn’t a serious fight, but I feel like I am literally wasting my life. I get more free time in the last hour of my workday now than I do a whole day at home. 

What do I even say or do? ",0,1735221213.0,relationship_advice,10,0.25,False
1hmorok,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlairEspresso/comments/1hmorok/james_hoffmann_tiramisù_recipe/,James Hoffmann Tiramisù recipe.,"[Pics and vids here!](https://imgur.com/a/james-hoffmann-tiramis-recipe-OA7XAP0)  
  
On monday I was with a terrible hangover wondering about my life choices as we all do, and a friend suggested me to make dessert for christmas, since it has been quite some time from the last time I made something sweet. Then I remembered James literally uploaded this recipe a couple days ago, and immediately signed up for it. Especially since this recipe is oriented for espresso users, and I now have a brand new Flair 58.  
  
I even made my own mascarpone cheese (literally just heating up cream to +-85º and dropping a bit of acid) because it's not so common around here and can be expensive. Used 1kg of cream, and ended up with 625g of mascarpone, just 15g shy of James' ""8 people"" recipe. I followed everything else to the letter (except the sous vide, just heated the eggs over a double boiler with the sugar for pasteurizing).   
  
I made 12 shots of 18 grams, with 4 shots for dialing in some cheap beans I froze a while ago in a bit over an hour. I can't imagine doing this with anything other than a 58mm portafilter machine like my other Flair Signature (especially with a hand grinder) and I definitely will not waste this much coffee again (although it wasn't all wasted, my family happily drinks any type of coffe with enough milk and sweeteners lol), I ended up with approx 320 grams of espresso with most shots being 36g-40g in about 25-28 secs. Not the best tasting espresso but at least better than just making a lazy french press or diluted moka brew.  
  
The mascarpone cream ended up being a hair too short, I barely could cover the whole tray, maybe the eggs texture was messed up from the double boiler and the fact that it sat there for over an hour when I was brewing the espresso shots. Also, I didn't need nearly as much coffee as the recipe suggests. I literally used maybe half of the 480g coffee requested, the rest also went straight to the fridge.  
  
Anyways, in the end I received so much compliments, not only for my sacrifice lol, but because everyone said it tasted soooo good. For me? It tasted good, obviously way stronger than any other tiramisù I ever had, but I kinda was hoping to find a bit better coffee flavor. Obviously it depends on the quality of your beans but I didn't feel like using 144g of good beans. The recipe isn't crazy sweet and I think the strong coffee really balances everything, but I don't think wasting so much coffee to not use it all and then maybe not tasting it in the final dish is worth it.

1hmoqcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hmoqcg/making_the_most_of_a_budget_espresso_machine_in/,Making the Most of a Budget Espresso Machine in Argentina [$100-$500],"Hey everyone,

For Christmas, my family gave me my very first espresso machine (the brand is Suono; from what I’ve seen, it’s quite similar to the DeLonghi Stilosa, in case you want to look it up). Just to give you some context, I live in Argentina, where prices in USD are extremely high, and the variety of coffee gear available is very limited.

They got me the machine because I’ve been making lattes with my AeroPress, Timemore C2, and a Nespresso milk frother. I love milk-based drinks like lattes, and I usually have 1 or 2 cups of coffee per day. However, I’m a bit stuck on how to get started with espresso. The Timemore C2 can’t grind fine enough for espresso, my scale only has a sensitivity of 1g (not 0.1g), and the tamper that comes with the machine is just a plastic scoop that doubles as a tamper.

Given all this, I’d really appreciate your advice on how to make the best possible coffee with this machine. Which accessories should I prioritize, and which ones would make the biggest difference in simplifying my process?

My budget can vary, but it’s tough to find good and affordable gear here. For reference, the Baratza Encore grinder costs around $350 USD, and even a generic cheap scale that measures to 0.1g is about $60 USD.

Thanks in advance for your help!

The Himalayas roared with an unforgiving wind, a relentless force that whipped through the crumbling remains of an ancient temple.

Snow lashed at the stone walls, the swirling storm barely muffling the clash of magic within. 

Inside the ruined sanctum, Doctor Stephen Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme, stood firm amidst the chaos, the crimson folds of his Cloak of Levitation snapping like a banner in battle.

Across from him, half-shrouded in smoke and shadows, a man radiating dark energy grinned through the destruction. 

Kaluu, an ancient mystic, regarded Strange with a predatory gaze. His blackened robes rippled as waves of magic pulsed around him, crackling with chaotic force.

“You should’ve stayed in Kamar-Taj, Strange,”

Kaluu hissed, his voice resonating with a sharp, venomous tone. 

“You’ve meddled where you don’t belong.”

Strange’s hands moved fluidly, golden glyphs sparking to life in the air as he countered an incoming barrage of dark tendrils. 

His expression was focused, unshaken.

“And let you run loose with powers you barely understand? Not my style.”

Kaluu sneered, his dark eyes narrowing as he summoned another wave of shadow. 

The temple trembled under their combined magic, loose stones falling from the high ceilings. 

[Crack…] 

A jagged fissure snaked across one of the ancient columns, sending a spray of dust cascading to the floor. 

Symbols etched deep into the walls glowed faintly, reacting to the intensity of their clash.

“You think you’re protecting something sacred.” 

Kaluu growled, raising his arms as black smoke coiled around his fingers.

“But all you’re doing is delaying the inevitable. This place has secrets you’ll never grasp.”

[Boom!]

A burst of dark energy erupted from Kaluu’s hands, sending vibrations rippling through the chamber, the sound reverberating like distant thunder.

Strange didn’t respond immediately. 

He had faced many threats in his time as Sorcerer Supreme, but something about Kaluu’s energy—his fervent desperation—set him on edge. 

The man wasn’t fighting out of arrogance or greed; he was driven by something far more dangerous: conviction.

Kaluu lunged, and the shadows he commanded came alive, snaking toward Strange with predatory speed. 

Strange countered with a swift motion of his hand, summoning the Shield of the Seraphim, a glowing golden barrier that absorbed the onslaught of energy. 

The impact sent vibrations through the temple floor, cracks spidering out from their feet. 

[Boom!] 

The collision echoed like a clap of thunder, shaking the ancient walls.

Strange stepped forward, his tone calm but firm. 

“You can’t control what you’ve unleashed here. Walk away, and this doesn’t have to end badly.”

Kaluu’s laugh echoed through the chamber, cold and unhinged. 

[Hah-hah!] The sound was jagged, almost inhuman. 

“You don’t understand, do you, Strange? This isn’t about control. This is about destiny. And you, of all people, should know you can’t stop it.”

With a sharp motion, Kaluu hurled a wave of dark energy toward Strange, the air around it distorting with its force. 

[Whummm!] 

The energy rippled, the oppressive sound building as it streaked toward him. 

Strange twisted his wrist, conjuring the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak—glowing red tendrils that wrapped around the attack, absorbing it before binding Kaluu’s arms and legs in place. 

[Snap!] 

The tendrils tightened, crackling as they locked Kaluu in place. 

The mystic snarled, struggling against the binding, but Strange tightened his grip with a flick of his fingers.

“Destiny is a convenient excuse for destruction…” 

Strange said, stepping closer. 

“But this temple, its power, isn’t yours to claim.”

Kaluu gritted his teeth, his expression defiant even as the bands held him firmly.

 “You’re wrong, Strange. This temple—this power—it’s not yours either. It belongs to the one it’s waiting for.”

Strange’s eyes narrowed. 

The cryptic statement lingered in the air, but he didn’t let it distract him. With a precise gesture, he summoned a portal beneath Kaluu’s feet. 

[Shwoom!] 

The ground shifted, glowing with mystic energy as Kaluu began to sink into the void.

“You can’t stop destiny!” 

Kaluu spat, his voice rising as his form disappeared into the portal. 

“The one who’s meant to wield this power—when they rise, even you will bow to them!”

Strange sealed the portal with a sharp motion, and the temple fell into an uneasy silence. 

Only the faint [Crackle…] of dissipating magic remained, mingling with the distant howl of the wind outside. 

Strange lowered his hands, exhaling slowly as the tension in the room subsided.

He turned toward the inner sanctum of the temple, his gaze falling on a raised dais in the center of the room. 

There, resting in a faint glow, was an artifact that seemed to pulse faintly with energy, as though alive. 

Strange approached cautiously, the weight of Kaluu’s words lingering in his mind.

The artifact’s intricate design caught the dim light, revealing symbols and patterns that seemed to shift subtly under Strange’s scrutiny. 

He didn’t reach for it. Instead, he hovered his hand above its surface, feeling the immense power radiating from it. 

This wasn’t an ordinary relic—it was tied to something far greater, something vast and unknowable.

As he closed his eyes, focusing on the energies surrounding the artifact, flashes of imagery began to flood his mind. 

They came in quick, disjointed bursts: a city skyline, familiar yet distant. Rooftops bathed in golden light.

And a boy—a figure leaping effortlessly between buildings, moving as though gravity itself was merely a suggestion.

The images sharpened, the boy’s face coming into focus. Strange’s brow furrowed as the name surfaced, clear and undeniable.

""Ethan Langston""

Strange’s eyes snapped open, the vision dissipating as quickly as it had come. He stepped back from the artifact, the name echoing in his thoughts. 

Whoever this boy was, he was connected to the artifact in ways Strange couldn’t yet understand. And if Kaluu’s claims about destiny held any truth, this boy’s life was about to change…

…

8:33 PM - San Francisco

That evening, as the lights of San Francisco began to glow against the encroaching darkness, Strange stood silently atop a rooftop in the city’s heart. 

His cloak settled around him as he observed the figure below—Ethan Langston, weaving effortlessly across the rooftops with the fluidity of a dancer. 

The boy’s movements were natural, precise, and unyielding, his confidence radiating in every leap and bound.

Strange watched as Ethan paused on a ledge, his phone propped up to capture his latest stunt. The boy grinned, his chest rising and falling with exhilaration. 

Strange couldn’t help but see the raw potential in him—the untapped power that was already subtly bending the world around him.

But the boy didn’t know. Not yet. For now, he was just Ethan Langston, living his life, unaware of the storm that was about to engulf him.

Strange stepped back into the shadows, his presence unnoticed. The gauntlet’s journey had already begun, and Ethan’s role in its story was inevitable. 

For now, Strange would watch, waiting for the right moment to intervene.

…

Philz Café, Minnesota Street

Late-night neon flickered against the windows of the café where Ethan Langston and Jay Kwon sat huddled over a laptop, reviewing raw footage of their most recent rooftop run. 

The digital glow danced across their faces as they watched themselves vault over alleyways and scale fire escapes. 

Outside, San Francisco’s busy streets still buzzed with life, but inside the café’s warm light, it felt like their own little world.

“Dude, check that angle!” 

Jay nearly spilled his coffee in excitement. 

He paused on a clip that showed Ethan clearing a wide gap between two buildings near the Embarcadero. The city lights behind him framed the jump perfectly, the bay shimmering under the moonlit sky.

Ethan, leaning back in his seat, grinned.

“That’s going in the highlight reel for sure. Think this’ll get more views than the last one?”

Jay shrugged, eyes bright. 

“We can only hope. You know how it is with the algorithm—unpredictable. But hey, we’ll keep posting. Somebody out there loves our brand of insanity.”

Ethan took a sip of water, sliding one earbud out. 

They had been at it for a good hour, trimming footage, adding quick transitions, and brainstorming a catchy thumbnail. 

His mind drifted for a moment, recalling the conversation he’d had with Jay about the future. 

Calm before the storm, Jay had said. But so far, life still felt pretty normal—just parkour, school, and the occasional run-in with bullies.

Jay tapped away at the keyboard, uploading their final edit to YouTube. 

“Alright, it’s live. Guess we wait.”

Ethan nodded, a hint of excitement warming his chest. 

Even if they weren’t aiming for viral fame, sharing their runs felt validating—like they were part of something bigger. 

“Cool. Let’s pack up. We’ve got school tomorrow.”

Jay shot him a playful smirk. 

“Who needs school when you’ve got sweet rooftop skills, right?”

Ethan just rolled his eyes, zipping his laptop bag. 

“You know Ms. Andrews will chew you out if you don’t show up for the physics quiz.”

Jay groaned. 

“Fair point. Let’s bounce.”

The next morning, Ethan was scrolling through his phone on the way to Jefferson High when a post on a local forum caught his attention:

SF UnderGround Parkour: High-Stakes Edition - No rules. Bring your skills. Win big. Mask up. Saturday night. Pier 70.

He frowned at the details. The event sounded sketchy—anonymous sign-ups, a big cash prize, and a mention of “sponsors” that sounded more like shadowy bettors than legit parkour fans. But it was also intriguing. 

His phone buzzed, and he noticed Jay had texted the link to him, too.

Jay: “Dude, this is wild. Let’s do it!”

Ethan typed a quick reply as he weaved through the crowded hallway:

Ethan: “Might be shady. You sure?”

Jay: “C’mon, we got skills. Bet we can take first place easy. I’m in. You?”

Even though a part of Ethan felt uneasy, he couldn’t deny the adrenaline jolt coursing through him at the thought of a no-holds-barred parkour challenge. 

Besides, the post mentioned a substantial payout, and Ethan could use some extra cash—bills at home were piling up, and his mom quietly stressed over finances. Maybe this could help, he reasoned.

He texted Jay back: 

“I’m in.”

As Ethan stared at his phone, his thoughts buzzing with excitement, another figure in the city was busy laying the foundation for the night’s chaos.

Pier 70 - Week Before The Event

The warehouse was dimly lit, the flicker of a lone overhead bulb casting jagged shadows across the room. The air smelled faintly of oil and concrete, the remnants of machinery long since abandoned. 

In the center of the space, a group of men gathered around a table cluttered with blueprints, stacks of cash, and a laptop displaying a live feed of a parkour course being hastily constructed across the rooftops of San Francisco.

At the head of the table stood Darius “Dare” Hines, leaning casually against a chair, his gold chain catching the weak light. 

His sharp grin was ever-present, exuding the same cocky charm that made him a natural in the underworld’s gray spaces.

Across from him, a thickset man with a gruff demeanor shuffled through the blueprints, muttering to himself.

“This the best course you could come up with?” 

The man grumbled, slapping a hand on the table. 

“Looks like a playground for kids.”

Dare laughed, low and easy, waving a hand dismissively. 

“Relax, Harry. The point isn’t the course—it’s the people running it. You think I care how many flips they can do? Nah, man, this is about eyeballs. Spectacle. Get the bets flowing, and the money takes care of itself.”

Harry scowled but said nothing, folding his arms as Dare straightened, addressing the room.

“Here’s how it works…” 

Dare began, pacing with a casual swagger. 

“We make it look like just another underground event. No big deal. Amateurs show up, try to make a name for themselves, maybe take home a few bucks if they’re lucky. But for us?” 

He tapped the side of his temple. 

“It’s all about the bigger picture.”

Another man at the table, lanky and wearing a leather jacket too big for his frame, leaned forward. 

“You mean Cottonmouth’s picture,” he said, his voice low.

Dare shot him a sharp look, his grin fading for the briefest moment. 

“Cottonmouth’s paying for this little experiment, yeah,” he said, his tone clipped. 

“But let’s be real—he’s looking for more than just money. This is about setting up shop. Expanding the empire. And if we do this right, we’re the ones who make it happen.”

The lanky man hesitated, then nodded. 

“Alright. So what’s the angle? Just the bets?”

Dare’s grin returned, sly and calculating. 

“The bets are the appetizer. Get the crowd hooked. But the main course? It’s all about finding talent. Cottonmouth’s got eyes on this city, and he’s looking for more than muscle. He wants someone who can move, someone who’s got something… special.”

Harry snorted, shaking his head. 

“So what, we’re scouting? That’s it?”

Dare stepped closer, his grin fading into something colder. 

“Think bigger, Harry. We’re not just scouting. We’re testing. We find the right people, we bring ‘em into the fold. The rest?” 

He shrugged. “They’re just cannon fodder. Something to keep the crowd entertained.”

The room fell quiet for a moment, the weight of Dare’s words settling over the group. The faint sound of hammering and shouting filtered in from outside as workers continued assembling the course. 

The live feed on the laptop showed the scaffolding and ramps coming together, a chaotic maze of obstacles designed to push the participants to their limits.

“And what about Cottonmouth?” the lanky man asked. 

“He cool with all this? Using his money for a sideshow?”

Dare smirked, pulling a cigarette from his pocket and lighting it with a flick of his lighter. 

“Cottonmouth doesn’t care how we do it, as long as it works. He wants control of this city, and I’m giving him a way in. Parkour, street racing, underground fights—it’s all just pieces of the puzzle. The people running the rooftops tonight? They don’t even know they’re part of the game.”

Harry grunted, glancing at the blueprints again. 

“And if this goes south?”

Dare exhaled a plume of smoke, his grin sharpening. 

“Then it’s not my problem. But trust me—nothing’s going south. This city’s ripe for the taking, and we’re gonna be the ones to bring it home.”

He tapped the stack of cash on the table, his eyes gleaming. 

“Now, get out there and make sure everything’s set. I don’t want any screw-ups when the runners show up.”

As the group dispersed, Dare stayed behind, leaning back against the table and watching the live feed. His grin widened as he spotted a few masked participants already warming up on the outskirts of the course.

“Let the games begin,” he muttered to himself, his voice low and amused.

…

Saturday Night at Pier 70

Pier 70 was a sprawling industrial site along the waterfront. Abandoned warehouses towered over the docks, their rusted metal frames and graffiti-stained walls creating a surreal urban jungle. 

Under the glow of makeshift floodlights, the place buzzed with energy—people in hoodies and masks milled around, a rough crowd of thrill-seekers and spectators.

Ethan and Jay arrived together, each wearing a mask they’d picked up from a costume store. 

Jay’s was a neon fox design, while Ethan’s was a sleek black faceplate with small teal accents around the eyes. They wore dark athletic gear, hoods up to obscure their faces. 

A requirement of the event was total anonymity: choose a codename, wear a mask, and keep your identity hidden.

They approached the sign-in table, where a bored-looking staffer took their info.

 “Codename?” she asked, eyeing Ethan.

He froze for a second, thinking about the alias he’d picked.

It was something from his father’s old files—an acronym that had once named a prototype device: E.O.N. 

Scrawled on a blueprint, it had fascinated him as a child. Ethan never knew exactly what it stood for, only that the file’s title read: “E.O.N. – Experimental Oscillation Nexus.” Or maybe it was “Energy Oriented Node.” The sketches were too faded to be sure. 

But the name stuck with him.

“Uh, Eon,” Ethan said firmly.

The staffer raised an eyebrow, nodded, and wrote it down. 

“You’re in. Good luck.”

Jay nudged Ethan, grinning behind his neon fox mask. 

“Eon, huh? Sounds futuristic.”

Ethan shrugged. 

“Just something that stuck with me.”

An announcement blared over the speakers: 

“Welcome to SF Underground Parkour—High-Stakes Edition! Competitors, to the starting line!”

A makeshift course had been set up across several warehouses, scaffolding, and shipping containers. Large ramps led to precarious rooftops, and the final stretch was a daring leap over a thirty-foot gap onto a cargo crane platform. 

Spectators cheered from below, placing last-minute bets.

Ethan’s heart thundered in his chest. Jay hopped in place, shaking out his limbs. 

“Let’s do this.”

As soon as the horn sounded, they were off. Bodies launched into a sprint, scrambling up walls and rolling across rooftops. 

Ethan felt the rush he always did, the sense that all that mattered was the next jump, the next step. He and Jay maneuvered in tandem, leaping across broken ledges and ducking under low-hanging beams.

A few other skilled runners kept pace, but Ethan and Jay had practiced for years. 

They slid down a metal ramp, turned a corner, and soared over a large gap, hitting the next rooftop in near-perfect unison. 

Cheers erupted below, where a crowd watched with rapt attention.

As they neared the final stretch, Ethan’s shoe snagged on a raised piece of metal. He stumbled, momentum lost. 

“Jay, keep going!” 

He yelled. Jay glanced back but pressed on.

Ethan’s heart pounded as he sprinted toward the final gap—a thirty-foot leap from the rooftop to a shipping container crane. 

He could see the others already ahead, their movements swift and sure, disappearing onto the steel platform. 

His breaths came in sharp bursts, his legs burning with every step.

At the ledge, he pushed off with all his strength. 

[Whoosh!] 

The sound of air rushing past filled his ears as he launched himself forward, arms outstretched, his body straining for the edge of the crane.

For a brief moment, the world seemed to hold its breath.

And then his foot slipped.

Panic surged through him as the metal edge gave way under his weight. 

The ground below—a deadly expanse of concrete and shipping containers—seemed to rise to meet him. His arms flailed instinctively, but he could feel gravity pulling him toward a fall he couldn’t survive.

Then, suddenly—Click.

The noise was subtle but sharp, like the snap of a lock turning. 

The world froze. Time itself stopped. The air hung motionless, the raindrops suspended mid-fall like tiny glass orbs. 

Ethan’s eyes darted around, wide with confusion. The cheers of the crowd were silenced, their mouths open in frozen gasps. 

His body hung in midair, weightless and immobile, like a fly caught in amber.

“What… what is this?” 

He whispered, his voice trembling in the vacuum of the moment.

The silence pressed against him, heavy and surreal. Every detail sharpened: the faint glint of rain on his shoes, the jagged tear in the metal where his foot had slipped. 

He could hear the slow, deliberate beat of his heart, impossibly loud in the stillness.

Then it came.

[Whirrr~]

A low, resonant hum filled the air, building like a distant storm. 

Time rewound in a blur of motion, dragging Ethan backward through the air, pulling him away from the fall and toward the rooftop. 

His stomach flipped as the entire sequence unraveled—his jump, his sprint, the starting line—all of it snapping back into place as if it had never happened.

He gasped, clutching the crumbling edge of the rooftop where he now stood. His legs trembled, and a sharp headache pounded behind his eyes. His chest heaved as he struggled to process what had just occurred.

“W-What the—?” 

He choked out, gripping the edge tighter. 

The texture of the rough stone grounded him, but his mind spun in frantic loops. 

His gaze darted around. The crowd was still there, cheering as if nothing had happened. 

No, not still—they had gone back. The moment had reset.

The hum faded, replaced by the sounds of reality. The sharp patter of rain resumed, tapping against the rooftops. 

Ethan closed his eyes, his breaths uneven. He glanced at the crane across the gap. His muscles ached, his head throbbed, but his memory was crystal clear. 

He had slipped. He had fallen. But now… he had another chance.

He adjusted his stance, this time planting his feet carefully on the ledge. 

“This time,” he muttered under his breath, “I’m not missing.”

With a powerful push, he leapt again. The wind rushed past him as he sailed through the air, his body aligning perfectly with the platform ahead. 

This time, the landing was flawless.

Cheers erupted below, but Ethan barely registered them. His body shook as he stood on the crane, his breaths shallow and ragged. 

Something had happened—something impossible.

His mind raced, but for now, he raised a fist to the crowd, a shaky grin masking the storm within.

Jay stared in disbelief from a few feet away, having caught only glimpses of Ethan’s near-death slip. 

“How the—? You were—?!” 

But time marched on, and the event staff blew another horn, indicating Ethan had successfully finished. 

Jay swallowed his confusion, pulling Ethan to his feet. 

“You good, man? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

“I—I don’t know…” 

Ethan mumbled, pressing a hand to his temple. 

A splitting migraine hammered behind his eyes. Black spots danced in his vision. He tried to stand but his legs buckled.

Jay reached out to steady him. 

“Whoa, you good?”

Ethan’s chest tightened. A migraine flared behind his eyes. 

“I…I’m not sure.” 

The edges of his vision went white, and before he could add anything else, darkness swallowed him…

A Dream of Infinite Worlds

Ethan blinked and found himself adrift in a kaleidoscopic landscape—multicolored swirls of light, images flickering in and out. 

[Whirrr…] 

A low, resonant hum surrounded him, vibrating through the expanse as if the entire universe were breathing in rhythm.

He saw visions of San Francisco twisted in impossible angles, recognized fleeting glimpses of alternative versions of himself: older, younger, sometimes wearing strange armor or carrying bizarre gadgets. 

A kaleidoscope of times and places layered over one another, all connected by thin threads of shimmering light.

[Zap!] 

A jagged streak of energy shot through the threads, causing them to ripple and pulse, momentarily distorting the swirling landscape. 

The sensation left Ethan breathless, his chest tightening as the reality around him seemed to crack under its weight.

He heard a voice—distant, echoing:

 “You… hold the key… Eon…”

And just like that, the visions evaporated. 

[Whoosh.] 

The swirling light dissolved into nothingness, leaving only an echo of something vast and incomprehensible.

Ethan’s eyes fluttered open. He lay on a makeshift cot in a side room of the warehouse, fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. He could hear muffled cheers and music from outside. 

Jay hovered by his side, mask pulled up on his forehead, worry etched across his features.

“Eon—Ethan—hey, can you hear me?” 

Jay asked softly, relief flooding his eyes as he noticed Ethan stirring.

Ethan pressed a hand to his temple, the headache still lingering. 

“W-What happened…?”

“You collapsed,” Jay explained, voice taut. 

“I dragged you off the course before any staffer could stick their nose in. Figured you wouldn’t want them prying.”

Ethan forced a weak chuckle. 

“Yeah… thanks. Did we… finish?”

Jay blinked. “We got second place, man. Some French dude was a hair faster. Not that it matters—are you okay?”

For a moment, Ethan just stared at the floor, replaying the impossible event. Time had reversed. He had rewound reality. Or had he imagined it? 

The memory was too vivid to dismiss—the sensation of falling, the hum of time rewinding, the sharp snap back to the ledge. 

His hands trembled slightly as he clenched them into fists.

“I… I think I need to get home,” he murmured, his voice barely audible.

“Sure, let’s go,” Jay said, his tone steady as he offered his shoulder. 

“We can split the winnings and bounce.”

They slipped away quietly, collecting their prize—an envelope of cash—and ignoring the curious looks from other runners. 

Ethan avoided eye contact, his mind racing, while Jay filled the silence with small talk about the competition.

Across the makeshift podium, Dare Hines leaned against a stack of crates, his sharp eyes narrowing as they caught Ethan’s pale expression. 

He tilted his head slightly, his usual grin fading into a thoughtful smirk. 

“Huh…” 

He muttered to himself, tapping a finger against his chin.

“Interesting.”

Ethan and Jay had already slipped out the back before anyone could ask questions, their footsteps disappearing into the night.

…

Later, in a darkened corner of Pier 70

Dare lit a cigarette, the faint glow casting shadows across his face as he pulled out his phone. 

The cold night air bit at his skin, but his focus was elsewhere. He dialed a number and held the phone to his ear, his smirk returning as the line connected.

“We might’ve found something,” he said, his voice low but excited.

The reply was muffled, but Dare’s grin widened as he exhaled a plume of smoke. 

“Oh, you’ll want to hear this. Something about one of our runners… the kid’s got potential.” 

He paused, glancing toward the faint silhouette of the city skyline. 

“And if I’m right? Cottonmouth’s gonna want to know.”

Dare hung up, flicking the cigarette into the gutter with a faint hiss. His eyes gleamed as he turned back toward the warehouse.

“Let the games begin.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to fashion and interior design, the right color combinations can create stunning visual experiences. One of the most elegant pairings that has stood the test of time is beige with either gold or silver. This combination works harmoniously to evoke a sense of sophistication and warmth, making it a popular choice among designers and stylish individuals alike.

Beige serves as a versatile canvas that enhances both gold and silver accents. This neutral shade offers a soft, understated backdrop that allows metallic tones to shine without overwhelming the senses. Here are a few ways in which beige beautifully pairs with gold or silver:

### The Warmth of Beige with Gold

Beige and gold create a delightful blend that exudes warmth and luxury. Gold brings a radiant glow that can brighten up any space or outfit, and when placed against beige, it creates a balanced yet cozy atmosphere. Here are some ways this combination shines:

- **In Fashion:** A beige dress with gold accessories makes for a chic look perfect for any occasion. Gold jewelry, such as chunky bracelets or delicate necklaces, adds a touch of glamour that effortlessly elevates your outfit.
- **In Interior Design:** In living spaces, beige walls paired with gold frames, decor, or fixtures can create an inviting and stylish room. Think of gold light fixtures or mirrors that reflect natural light, giving the space an ethereal glow.
- **In Textiles:** Beige cushions adorned with gold embroidery can serve as standout pieces in your living room. This mix invites warmth and luxury into your home while ensuring it remains comfortable and approachable.

### The Sophistication of Beige with Silver

On the other hand, pairing beige with silver offers a sleek and modern aesthetic. Silver's cool tones contrast elegantly with the warmth of beige, creating a refined look. This combination is perfect for those who prefer a chic, understated elegance.

- **In Fashion:** A beige suit can be perfectly complemented by silver accessories, such as a sleek handbag or stylish loafers. This look is suitable for professional settings while still allowing for your personal flair.
- **In Interior Design:** Bathrooms or kitchens often look stunning when beige tiles are matched with silver fixtures. This combination enhances a modern appearance while remaining timeless and clean.
- **In Artwork:** Adding silver accents to beige canvas art can make a statement in a room. Look for wall art that combines both colors to create a seamless transition and visual flow in your decor.

### Layering Textures for Visual Interest

Moreover, layering different textures can elevate the beige and metallic pairing even further. For example, consider incorporating soft textiles like velvet or silk in beige alongside metallic gold or silver elements. This tactile diversity adds depth to your design while maintaining a cohesive color palette.

In a room setting, you might use a beige upholstered sofa with silver or gold accent pillows and throws. On a fashion level, imagine soft beige fabrics, such as a cashmere sweater paired with silver metallic skirts or gold-plated chunky necklaces. Such combinations allow the neutral base to showcase the shiny elements while keeping the overall look balanced and sophisticated.

### Creating Balance with Accessories

Accessories play a crucial role in achieving the perfect balance between beige and metallics. Since both gold and silver can vary in hue and shine, consider mixing these metals judiciously. A well-placed gold lamp can complement beige furniture while a silver coffee table can provide a sleek contrast.

Additionally, when styling your outfits, don’t shy away from combining both gold and silver together. A beige ensemble can be beautifully enhanced with both gold and silver jewelry. Just a hint of metallic shine can take your look from simple to stunning.

The pairing of beige with either gold or silver opens up a world of possibilities in both fashion and interior design. It’s a classic combination that stands out yet stays understated. By thoughtfully incorporating these colors into your wardrobe or home decor, you can achieve a refined and elegant aesthetic that speaks to your personal style. Whether you gravitate towards the warm embrace of gold or the cool sophistication of silver, embracing this color pairing will undoubtedly elevate your designs to new heights.

I started dating someone in the summer. I’m not one to fall into NRE but this definitely came close to it. Butterflies in my tummy. A real desire to spend time with him. He said he had been manifesting a different non-traditional relationship for a year and he was happy to get to know me. Fast forward a few months and things are getting serious and he decided that this is something he wasn’t ready for. He had gone on a date with someone else and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was cheating on me. It was very distressing for him. At this point I was already feeling love for him and my heart was so sad. I respected his decision and his honesty. I wished him well and moved on. Over the next 6-7 weeks there was very little communication. We would send funny memes to each other on IG, but that’s about it. Last week he reaches out to me and asks to meet for a coffee. He appreciated that we kept the lines of communication open, and asked to talk. 

He spent every day of the last 6 weeks thinking about me. Regretting his decision to end it. He asked if we could slowly try again. This time though, he’s done his research. He’s watched polyamory videos. Subscribed to subs and fb poly groups. He’s doing a deep dive into learning. And most importantly, his mistake the first time was making (incorrect) assumptions, so he’s not making assumptions any more and he’s going to communicate and ask more questions. We’ve had a few dates since then and we have spent hours talking and breaking down what polyamory entails. 

I was surprised. Gobsmacked really. Sometimes you have to let things go if they don’t fit into your life. But sometimes those things come back around to you when the timing is better. 

He’s breaking down his internalized monogamy and programming. He’s happy. I’m happy. All is well. ",3,1735220683.0,polyamory,1,1.0,False

That’s what happened to me at the LIAM Workshop at Great Eastern on December 18-19, 2023. As insurance interns from different companies came together, I had no idea how special these two days would be.

When I walked into Great Eastern’s office, I was one of the first to arrive along with my colleague from Great Eastern, who also studied at UTAR like me. The room was filled with 24 eager participants, all ready to start. We had the chance to choose our teammates, almost like shopping for the perfect ingredients. That’s how I ended up with Celeste and Guan Hong from AmMetLife, and Hazwa from MCIS Insurance. Even though we worked at different companies and didn’t know each other before, we clicked right away because we all brought unique skills to the table. We were all a bit nervous but excited when they told us our task: to come up with new ways to make insurance better using technology.

# Working Together on Our Big Idea

Our team had four people instead of five, but this turned out to be perfect. Everyone brought something different.

[Standing up to share our ideas - nervous but ready!](https://preview.redd.it/u4p8xt51579e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69bff89f167453ad82efa33811867e8ed1236213)

After lots of talking (and many coffee breaks!), we came up with an app that would use AI to help people understand insurance better. I remember how excited Celeste was about making insurance easier to understand, and how Guan Hong helped find sources to prove our statments. Hazwa made sure our idea would actually help real people. We wanted to:

* Help people find the right insurance
* Make insurance words easier to understand
* Let AI suggest the best plans for each person

# Getting Ready to Present

The night before our big presentation, we stayed up going over everything. I can still see us sitting together, with Hazwa and Guan Hong finding helpful facts, and Celeste making our idea clearer. Even after we all went back home, we continued to work on our parts, making sure everything was perfect. When it was time to present, we all stood together, each taking turns to explain our parts. I was nervous, but my teammates believed in me, and that made all the difference.

When it was time to present the app, we were excited to show a hands-on demo using the app mock-up on a phone. However, just as the judges were about to try it out, the phone app died unexpectedly. We had to switch to presenting on the projector instead. It was a bit disappointing, but we didn’t let it stop us. We continued with our presentation, making sure to explain everything clearly and keep the judges engaged.

# The Big Surprise

When it was time for the awards, we all held hands and hoped for the best. Hearing our team announced as the winners of the Best Team Award was an incredible moment. It was a testament to the power of collaboration and the unique strengths each member brought to the table. The recognition was not just for our idea, but for how well we worked together to bring it to life.

When they called my name for the Best Presenter award, I was genuinely surprised and deeply honored. This achievement was a personal milestone for me, reflecting my ability to present our ideas clearly and passionately. It was a proud moment that I will always cherish.

[Our Team getting best team prize](https://preview.redd.it/n6gvanrm479e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=317937510a41279061b6e04ea334069de49b0511)

What I learned:

1. A small team can do big things if everyone works together
2. Good ideas come from understanding what people need
3. Speaking clearly is more important than using big words
4. Being a leader means helping others and speaking up when needed

This workshop wasn’t just about winning awards. It was about learning new things and growing together. I’ll always remember how we worked together to solve problems.

To my teammates Celeste, Guan Hong, and Hazwa - thank you for making these two days so special. It didn’t matter that we came from different companies; what mattered was how well we worked together. Thank you to LIAM and Great Eastern for bringing us together.

As Helen Keller said, “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” Our team showed just how true this is.

That hasn't worked, here is my debt breakdown. ","**Debt**

$9k credit card debt (20-25% APR). 3k doesn't collect interest until April. 

$16k personal loan debt from trying to consolidate credit card debt between my personal cards and cards I used for my small business. 30% interest rate. Right now I'm paying $450 a month on this. 

$19k in federal student loans

$10k in Sallie Mae student loans 14% interest 

$11k left on my car. 8% interest. I am a huge guillable dummy and paid some huge fee to finance the car instead of my down payment going to the actual car. So I don't see selling my car as an option as I would be at a significant loss. At least I can get another 5 years of commuting to work out of this. 

**Income**

Currently taking home $1700 bi weekly. Will increase to $2100 bi weekly next august when I complete school. 

Also by next August I will be certified in my field (Medical Lab Science) and will be able to pick up extra shifts as a PRN at other locations. 

I have 5k in tuition reimbursement coming hopefully next pay period. I am planning to use it to pay down the personal loan. The other 5k reimbursement will come at the end of spring semester.

My small business will hopefully be selling in the next few months. When everything goes through with that my portion will be about 12k after taxes. Also for personal loan when I get that. 

Rent/phone/storage/electric/city $1000/month
I have no idea what I spend on food I should figure that out 

**How TF did I get here**

Obviously, impulsive spending poor life planning and being realistic with my choices. Thinking I could afford the seasonal dirt bag lifestyle and only work 7 months out of the year. This has all accumulated over about 4 years (except the undergraduate student loans). Partner wanted to run a small business and instead of saying ""no I can't afford it"" I went along with it anyways and sacrificed 3 years of income and spent all my savings for a job that made me miserable. I also am so afraid to face the poop hole I've gotten myself into and I keep my head in the sand. I don't want to ask for help so I keep spending money on decent groceries/house projects to seem normal when really I'm drowning and am barely on a rice and beans budget. 

Too many coffees, too many apps/subscriptions. Too many clothig purchases off Poshmark! I thought I was saving money but really by buying secondhand offline I was rarely *loving* what I bought and so therefore would just buy more. 

**Where I want to be** 

Debt free! Eventually! By the end of next year I would like to have my credit cards and personal loans paid off (25k accruing interest so probably more like 30k). Hopefully my business sells (-12k) and I will be using 10k in tuition reimbursement for the personal loan. Then putting $1000 towards credit card debt/month

------------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is a crucial part of maintaining good health. Most of our body is made up of water, and it plays many important roles in our daily lives. Understanding how much water you should drink each day can be a game-changer for your overall well-being. Let’s explore the top benefits of making sure you get enough water daily.

### Boosts Energy Levels

Feeling tired or sluggish? One reason could be that you’re not drinking enough water. Dehydration can lead to fatigue since even a small loss of fluid can impact your energy levels. By drinking adequate water, you can help keep your body energized and ready to tackle the day.

### Improves Focus and Concentration

Staying hydrated is essential for your brain function. Studies show that even mild dehydration can affect your mood and concentration. When you're well-hydrated, you’re more likely to stay focused and think clearly, which is especially important when you need to get work done or stay alert during a long meeting.

### Supports Healthy Digestion

Your digestive system depends on water to function properly. Drinking enough can help prevent issues like bloating and constipation. Water aids in breaking down food, allowing your body to absorb nutrients effectively. Here’s how to enhance your digestive health through hydration:

- Drink water before meals to prepare your digestive system.
- Incorporate water-rich foods like fruits and vegetables into your diet.
- Aim for at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily.

### Promotes Healthy Skin

If you want glowing skin, hydration is key. Water helps to keep your skin moisturized and can improve its elasticity. When you’re well-hydrated, your skin is less likely to appear dry and flaky. By drinking enough water daily, you can support a radiant complexion and reduce the appearance of fine lines.

### Aids in Weight Management

Looking to manage your weight? Drinking water can help. Drinking water before meals can reduce your appetite, making it easier to eat less. Additionally, choosing water over sugary drinks can reduce your overall caloric intake. Here are a few tips to use water for weight management:

- Replace sodas and juices with water to cut calories.
- Use water as a hunger suppressant before meals.
- Keep a water bottle handy to remind you to stay hydrated.

### Regulates Body Temperature

Water plays a critical role in regulating your body temperature. When you exercise or it's hot outside, you sweat to cool down. This process relies on having enough water in your system. If you don’t drink enough, you risk overheating. Stay cool and comfortable by making hydration a priority.

### Enhances Physical Performance

Whether you enjoy running, cycling, or any other sport, staying hydrated is crucial for peak performance. Dehydration can lead to decreased strength and stamina. Make sure to drink water before, during, and after your workouts to keep your body performing at its best.

### How Much Water Should You Drink Daily?

The common recommendation is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, known as the “8x8 rule.” However, the amount can vary based on several factors:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Activity Level:** If you exercise frequently, you may need more.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid conditions require increased hydration.
- **Health Status:** Certain health conditions or medications can influence your hydration needs.

To get a better idea of how much water is right for you, pay attention to your body's signals. If you're feeling thirsty or your urine is dark, it’s likely time to drink more.

Enough water into your daily routine can lead to numerous benefits, from improved focus and energy to better digestion and skin. Make hydration a part of your lifestyle, and you'll feel the difference it makes. Remember, your body deserves the best—so give it the water it craves!

Hydration and Its Impact on Physical Performance
------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is essential for everyone, but it plays a particularly crucial role in enhancing physical performance. Whether you’re an athlete or someone who enjoys occasional workouts, understanding how hydration impacts your body can lead to better performance and results.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
When you work out, your body loses water through sweat. Dehydration can start to affect your performance even before you realize it. Here are some key ways hydration influences your physical performance:

### Improved Endurance

Drinking enough water helps maintain your endurance during workouts. During intense physical activities, adequate hydration supports cardiovascular function and keeps your heart rate in check. This allows you to exercise longer before you start to feel fatigued.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Increased Strength

Water plays a vital role in muscle function. When your muscles are well-hydrated, they are stronger and can perform better. Dehydration can lead to muscle fatigue, which might reduce your ability to lift weights or engage in strenuous activities. Staying hydrated ensures that your muscles can contract optimally, promoting better strength outcomes.

### Enhanced Recovery

Hydration is essential for recovery after intense workouts. Proper fluid intake helps to transport nutrients throughout your body and remove waste products. By drinking enough water, you reduce muscle soreness and aid the recovery process, allowing you to hit the gym harder the next day. Consider drinking water or electrolyte-rich beverages after exercising to replenish lost fluids.

### Better Focus and Concentration

Even subtle dehydration can negatively affect cognitive function. When you’re well-hydrated, your brain functions better, helping you maintain focus during workouts. You can concentrate on your movements and techniques, which is crucial for preventing injuries and improving your overall performance.

### Temperature Regulation

Your body needs adequate fluids to help maintain a stable temperature, especially during physical exertion. Sweating is a natural cooling mechanism, and if you’re dehydrated, your body has a harder time cooling down. This can lead to fatigue, heat exhaustion, or heat stroke. By staying properly hydrated, you ensure your body can sweat effectively and regulate its temperature in hot conditions.

### Creative Hydration Tips

To stay hydrated, consider these practical tips:

- **Drink Before You’re Thirsty:** Don’t wait until you’re thirsty to have a drink. Make a habit of sipping water throughout the day.
- **Set Reminders:** Use phone alarms or apps to remind you to drink water regularly.
- **Infuse Your Water:** Add slices of fruits or herbs to make plain water more appealing.
- **Have a Water Bottle Handy:** Carry a reusable water bottle wherever you go. It’s a constant reminder to stay hydrated.
- **Check Your Urine:** A light yellow color usually means you’re well-hydrated. Darker urine may indicate you should drink more water.

### The Right Amount of Water

Many people ask, ""How much water should I drink?"" A common guideline is to aim for about 8 cups (64 ounces) of water each day. However, factors like your weight, activity level, and climate can affect your individual needs. A useful formula is to divide your body weight in pounds by two; that’s the number of ounces of water you should aim for daily. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, you should try to drink around 75 ounces of water each day.

### Hydration Sources

While drinking water is essential, you can also get hydration from:

- Fruits such as watermelon, oranges, and strawberries.
- Vegetables like cucumbers, lettuce, and celery.
- Soups and smoothies.

Ultimately, focusing on hydration is key for anyone looking to boost their physical performance. Remember to listen to your body and adjust your intake according to your needs and activity levels. By incorporating these tips and recognizing the importance of staying hydrated, you can elevate your exercise routine and achieve your fitness goals more effectively.

Water Consumption and Mental Clarity: The Connection
----------------------------------------------------

Water plays a crucial role in our overall well-being, and its impact on mental clarity is becoming increasingly recognized. Understanding the connection between hydration and cognitive function can help you enhance your daily performance, whether at work, school, or home. Ensuring you drink an adequate amount of water can lead to significant improvements in mental clarity.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
When your body is dehydrated, your brain is one of the first organs to feel the effects. This is because the brain is approximately 75% water. Even a slight decrease in hydration levels can lead to issues such as fatigue, confusion, and trouble concentrating. So, how much water should you drink to maintain optimal mental clarity? The general guideline is to aim for about 8 to 10 cups of water a day, but needs can vary based on individual activity levels and environmental factors.

### The impact of hydration on cognitive function

Staying properly hydrated can contribute to a range of cognitive improvements. Some of the notable benefits include:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Improved focus:** Hydration helps maintain adequate blood flow to the brain, allowing you to concentrate better on tasks.
- **Enhanced memory:** Studies suggest that proper hydration can boost both short-term and long-term memory retention.
- **Increased alertness:** Water consumption can help prevent the lingering fatigue that accompanies dehydration, keeping you mentally sharp.
- **Better mood:** Dehydration has been linked to increased feelings of anxiety and irritability. Adequate water intake can help stabilize your mood.

### Signs you may be dehydrated

Understanding how to recognize dehydration is crucial for maintaining mental clarity. Here are some common signs:

- Dry mouth: A lack of moisture can lead to discomfort and difficulty focusing.
- Headaches: Dehydration is a frequent cause of tension headaches.
- Fatigue: Feeling unusually tired can be your body signaling that you need more water.
- Difficulty concentrating: A foggy mind often indicates that you need to drink more water.

### Integrating water consumption into your routine

To maximize the benefits of hydration for mental clarity, try these effective strategies:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
1. **Set reminders:** Use your phone or calendar to schedule hydration breaks throughout the day. This ensures you stay on track.
2. **Carry a reusable water bottle:** Having water readily available encourages you to sip consistently.
3. **Flavor your water:** If plain water doesn’t excite you, consider adding fruits or herbs to enhance the taste. Options like lemon, cucumber, or mint can make drinking more enjoyable.
4. **Track your intake:** Use an app or a journal to monitor how much water you’re consuming. This can help you improve habits over time.

### Mindfulness and hydration

Being conscious of how your body feels regarding hydration can significantly impact your mental clarity. While drinking water is essential, listening to your body's signals is equally important.

Practical Tips for Increasing Your Daily Water Intake
-----------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is crucial for your overall health, and it’s easy to overlook how much water you should drink each day. If you’re looking to boost your daily water intake, here are some practical tips that can help you stay on track and feel your best.

### Start Your Day with Water

One of the simplest ways to increase your daily water intake is to start your morning with a glass of water. After sleeping for several hours, your body needs hydration to kickstart your metabolism. As soon as you wake up, drink a glass of water; it sets a positive tone for the rest of your day.

### Set Reminders

With our busy lifestyles, it's easy to forget to drink water. Setting reminders on your phone or using apps designed to track water intake can be an effective strategy. Choose intervals throughout the day to nudge yourself to take a sip. You might be surprised by how much easier it becomes to meet your hydration goals.

### Use a Reusable Water Bottle

Investing in a reusable water bottle can make a significant difference. Opt for one that’s easy to carry and fits into your daily routine. You’re more likely to drink water if it’s conveniently available. Plus, having a marked water bottle with incremental measurements can help you gauge your intake throughout the day.

### Incorporate Water-rich Foods

Eating foods with high water content is a delicious way to increase your hydration. Here are some tasty options:

- Watermelon
- Cucumber
- Strawberries
- Celery
- Spinach

These foods not only hydrate you but also add essential nutrients to your diet.

### Drink Before Meals

Another effective strategy is to drink a glass of water before each meal. Not only does this increase your daily consumption, but it can also help you feel fuller, which may support weight management. Make it a habit to pour yourself a glass before you eat.

### Add Flavor to Your Water

If you find plain water boring, try infusing it with fruits, herbs, or even spices. Lemon, mint, or berries can add a refreshing twist and make you more excited to drink water. The more enjoyable it is, the more likely you’ll keep sipping throughout the day.

### Keep Water Accessible

Ensure that you have easy access to water at all times. Keep a glass of water on your desk while working or bring a water bottle with you when you’re out. The mere presence of water can remind you to drink more frequently.

### Pair Water with Activities

Incorporate water into your daily activities. For instance, drink a glass of water while watching your favorite TV show or during breaks at work. Pairing water consumption with another routine activity can help make it a regular part of your day.

### Track Your Intake

Keeping a journal or using an app to track your daily water intake can help you stay accountable. Seeing how much you've drunk can motivate you to reach your goal. Set incremental targets and celebrate your achievements as you get closer to your daily target.

### Stay Mindful of Your Body

Pay attention to your body's signals, such as thirst and dryness. When you feel thirsty, don’t wait! Grab a glass of water right away. From dry skin to headaches, these can signal that you need more fluids.

### Make It a Group Effort

Involve your friends or family in your hydration challenge. You can encourage each other to drink more water and even share tips. Whether through text reminders or friendly competitions, having a support system can make a significant impact.

Increasing your daily water intake doesn’t have to be a daunting task. By using these practical tips, you can easily integrate more hydration into your routine. Remember, your body will thank you for it!

Common Myths About Hydration: Separating Fact from Fiction
----------------------------------------------------------

Hydration is crucial for your health, but many misconceptions surround how we should drink water. Understanding these myths can help you maintain proper hydration. Let’s explore common myths about hydration and distinguish between fact and fiction.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 1: You Must Drink Eight Glasses of Water Daily

This popular belief isn't a one-size-fits-all rule. While the eight-glass guideline helps some people remember to drink water, your needs depend on various factors. These include:

- Your age and sex
- Your physical activity level
- The climate you live in
- Your overall health

Some individuals may require more or less than the standard eight glasses to stay adequately hydrated. Listening to your body and adjusting your intake accordingly is always advised.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 2: You Only Need Water When You’re Thirsty

Although thirst is a natural indicator, it isn’t the sole signal of dehydration. By the time you feel thirsty, you may already be mildly dehydrated. Regularly sipping water throughout the day prevents this. Think of hydration like a steady stream rather than a last-minute rush.

### Myth 3: Drinks Like Coffee and Tea Dehydrate You

Some people believe that caffeinated beverages lead to dehydration. In reality, moderate amounts of coffee and tea can count toward your daily fluid intake. While caffeine does have a mild diuretic effect, studies show that drinking these beverages in moderation does not cause significant dehydration. Enjoy your morning cup without guilt!

### Myth 4: You Can’t Hydrate with Foods

Water isn’t the only source of hydration. Many foods, especially fruits and vegetables, are packed with water and contribute significantly to your daily fluid intake. Consider adding hydrating foods such as:

- Watermelon
- Cucumbers
- Oranges
- Strawberries
- Celery

These delicious options can keep you hydrated while providing essential nutrients.

### Myth 5: All Your Fluids Should Come from Water

While water is an excellent choice for hydration, it’s not the only option. Other beverages, such as herbal teas, milk, and even juices, can keep you hydrated. However, be cautious with sugary drinks, as they can lead to excess calorie intake and may not be the best for overall health.

### Myth 6: Hydration is Only Important During Exercise

Many think hydration is only critical when exercising. However, you need to stay hydrated throughout the day, whether you're active or not. Your body constantly loses water through breathing, sweating, and even digestion. Therefore, drinking fluids regularly is vital for your overall well-being.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 7: Clear Urine Means You're Perfectly Hydrated

While light-colored urine often indicates good hydration, it isn't the definitive answer. Certain foods, medications, and supplements can alter urine color. Additionally, hydration needs vary throughout the day. Instead of relying solely on urine color, consider whether you experience other signs of hydration, like energy levels and skin elasticity.

### Myth 8: Electrolyte Drinks are Necessary for Everyone

Electrolyte drinks can be helpful during intense workout sessions or after prolonged illness. However, they are not necessary for daily hydration for most people. Plain water usually suffices for everyday activities. Save those electrolyte beverages for after you've sweated heavily or engaged in strenuous exercise.

### Tips for Staying Hydrated

Now that you’ve debunked common myths, here are some practical tips to help you stay hydrated:

- Carry a reusable water bottle to keep track of your intake.
- Set reminders throughout the day to drink water.
- Incorporate hydrating foods into your meals and snacks.
- Monitor your energy levels and thirst cues.

Staying properly hydrated is essential for maintaining good health. By understanding these myths, you can improve your hydration habits and enjoy the benefits that come with it.

### Conclusion

Adequate water intake into your daily routine unlocks a myriad of benefits that extend beyond mere hydration. Understanding how much water you should drink daily is crucial for maintaining overall health. Hydration plays a significant role in enhancing physical performance, making you feel more energized and focused during workouts. Whether you’re hitting the gym or enjoying outdoor activities, staying properly hydrated can boost your endurance and agility.

When you embrace the habit of drinking enough water, you're also nurturing your brain's health.

To make water-a companion in your daily life, consider practical tips such as carrying a reusable water bottle, setting reminders, or infusing your water with fruits for added flavor. These small changes can lead to significant improvements in your hydration habits.

By recognizing the essential role of water, understanding its benefits for both your body and mind, and implementing practical strategies, you empower yourself to thrive. Start making conscious choices about your water intake today, and witness positive changes in your energy levels, mental clarity, and overall wellness.

Hi everyone, 


I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc. 


As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.  


In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).


I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.


Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me). 


In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

Sunday morning woke up with a headache. Figured it was just a hangover but it still hasn’t fully gone away. For the last 2 days the back of my neck has been sore causing a tension headache that then progresses to the migraine I’ve been feeling since sun morning  as well sometimes both at the same time. It’s currently 4 am and I was woken up with this.  The back of my head where it meets my neck is severely sore as well as right side of my forehead and around my right eye are pounding. Pain level is probably an 8/10 and it’s definitely one of the worst headaches I’ve ever had. So bad I’m considering having someone drive me to the ER if they can even do anything about this. 

I had no head injuries or anything like that. The level of alcohol drank wasn’t anything more than I usually do or something I couldn’t handle as I was not near blacking out or  anything similar. Could it still possibly be some sort of hangover? I’ve heard of people having reactions to certain types of alcohol, and that night I drank whiskey which I don’t usually do. 

I pulled a muscle on my back last week. Causing me to walk at a bad posture for a day or two. Which maybe could be the cause of the neck pain? 

I’ve been taking excedrin for migraine to just be able to function. As I still have a dull headache with it most of the time. As well as neck pain. Other than that I am not on any prescription or anything. 

Another theory I have is possible addiction to caffeine? I had my finals last week and was drinking coffee to stay up at night. But I’m a semi regular coffee drinker so I don’t understand why I would have issues now. 

Any help or tips for relief would be appreciated as I can’t even sleep properly.

👔 **9 AM - 6 PM:** Work? Sure, but my mind is elsewhere. My colleagues think I’m focused, but I’m really calculating how much I’ll make when $EGO hits 2.4M MCAP again. Spoiler: a lot.



🏋️‍♂️ **7 PM:** Gym time. Every rep is a silent prayer for the next pump. ""Push for EGO, pull for gains!""



💻 **9 PM:** Research time. Solana, Base, Tron… and soon a secret new chain? My gut says Abstract, but who knows?



🎮 **10 PM:** Watching the teaser for gamified staking. If EGO turns staking into a game, I’ll probably hit level 100 just farming degen vibes.



💭 **11 PM:** Pre-sleep thoughts. I’m already picturing myself at the next IRL, shaking hands with Loïc BELLEZ, celebrating $EGO breaking into the top 10 memecoins.

1hmnwr4,https://i.redd.it/bfn47kvcy69e1.jpeg,Magnifica ESAM04.110S Any idea what's going on here?,"I just bought a magnifica bean to cup machine. It's second hand.

It worked perfectly yesterday, used it as few times. Switched it off just by the power button on the front, went to bed and got up this morning to this light show. No one has touched it overnight. Can't find any videos on yt of this warning light combination. I'm stumped. 

I have a video, but not sure how to upload it here. 
No buttons really do anything, the steam button seems to activate a repositioning of the infuser inside, rather that hear up the thermal block. Sometimes after pressing the steam button, once it's repositioned things, you can brew a coffee. Eco button doesn't turn off eco mode, rinse/descale button doesn't work, nothing is really doing what it should.


It is an old machine, didn't realise how old until reading the documents i got with it this morning. It was last serviced/repaired in 2012 😂😬.

I'm hoping I haven't wasted my money (although it wasn't a huge amount) and that there's a way to solve this as yesterday I thought it was a great machine.

I've tried all the solutions I can find online, emptying everything, washing everything, refilling everything. Can't run a descale as that button isn't working.

Any ideas? Do I need a service call, and if so, do they even still service something this old?",1,1735218119.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False

Hey, fellow Travel Trotters! After globe-trotting my way through 50 incredible countries, I've finally sat down to share some unique, heartfelt, and sometimes quirky experiences with you all. Whether you're an experienced wanderer or just planning your first big trip, there’s a little something here for everyone. So grab a cup of coffee (or a glass of wine 😉) and let’s dive into some unforgettable travel adventures.

#### 🌟 Unique Experiences You Can't Miss

1. **Dine in a Cave Restaurant in Italy 🇮🇹**
   Imagine savoring a delicious meal in a centuries-old cave overlooking the Adriatic Sea. In Polignano a Mare, Italy, you can do just that. Grotta Palazzese offers a dining experience that’s both romantic and other-worldly. Pro tip: Book well in advance and time your visit around sunset for a truly magical evening.

2. **Chase the Northern Lights in Iceland 🇮🇸**
   Standing under a sky illuminated by the Aurora Borealis was nothing short of surreal. The best time to go is between September and April, when the nights are longest. For the best chance of a great view, head to remote areas away from light pollution. Don’t forget to dress warmly and bring a tripod for those stunning long-exposure photos.

#### 🏕️ Tips for the Adventurous Traveler

- **Pack Smart, Pack Light**: Trust me, you don’t need five pairs of shoes. Stick to essentials and versatile clothing pieces to keep your backpack manageable. Plus, you’ll want some extra space for souvenirs.
  
- **Learn Basic Local Phrases**: A friendly ""hello"" or ""thank you"" in the local language can go a long way in making connections and enhancing your travel experience.

- **Embrace the Unexpected**: Some of my most memorable adventures began with detours due to unexpected weather or spontaneous decisions to join local festivals. Stay flexible, and you'll often find the best stories.

#### 🚀 My Memorable Moments: From Samba Dancing in Brazil to Hiking in Nepal

Travel isn’t just about ticking boxes; it’s about the stories you gather along the way. Like that time I got drenched during Holi festival in India, covered head to toe in colorful powders, or when I learned to dance samba in a small Brazilian village, the rhythms ingrained in every joyful movement.

And let’s not forget the serene moment hiking the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal, where the sheer scale of the Himalayas made my daily worries seem insignificant.

I loved working on aesthetic boards for each of the four seasons, dream decor ideas for my house, or even just cool pictures that caught my eye. If I had plans for that day, I would use it to curate ideas for outfits, aesthetics, or just to get into the right mindset for the event.

But...these days it's lost it's appeal. 

The new algorithm now clogs my home board with pins unrelated to my interests, pins I've already pinned weeks ago, or just ads. 
So. Many. Ads.

(And don't even get  me started on the constant violation notices for pins I've had for years...🙄)

Pinterest has lost its coziness for me. Even the boards I already have made don't feel as pleasing to me because of how the format has changed. I find myself on it less and less these days, and at this point, I'm only keeping it for work related items. I'm hoping that one day that the owners will see the light and fix what isn't working, but that's probably just me screaming into the void.

Take a moment to think about any electronic device or piece of equipment containing electronics. There’s the coffee pot you use every morning, a smartphone you carry around in your pocket, the computer you use for work, a child’s battery powered toy, an electric car zooming down the interstate, robotic armatures welding together car parts in an automobile factor, a satellite orbiting earth, a robotic vehicle exploring Mars – each of these and other common electronic items contain circuits within them.

Circuits are ubiquitous in our modern world and perform important tasks for the majority of us on the planet every single day, but what exactly *is* a circuit?

We take an unorthodox approach to learn what a circuit is, unravel their mysteries and explore their significance in the realm of electronics.

Recently, I've been exposed to all the stories and posts, and I was thinking of sharing my story.

So, about 10 years ago, I got divorced. At the time, I, 39M, was married to my wife, Emily, 38F, for almost 9 years, and we had two sons: 8M and 6M.

The moment I saw her at the same coffee shop I used to go to every morning before my work shift, I knew I wanted to ask her out. After 2-3 times of hesitating, I finally asked her, and she agreed. About a month later, we were dating. I don't know if I noticed right away or if all the first relationships disgraced me, but she used to ask odd things while we were dating, and I just rolled with it. She asked that the car be clean before I picked her up and that if she spent the night, I would change the sheets and other small things.

One day, she announced that she got pregnant, and the path to a wedding was pretty much straight. We got married quickly before that belly would pop. I don't know why I accepted it, but her demeanor increased after the labor became insufferable; when I confronted her, telling her that I was not her employee, she would state that this is the way she demanded her life would be, and I couldn't argue.

Fast-forward to before the divorce. Our life was a list of demands and strict roles for me and the boys, including cleaning, dressing, and chores. At one point, she woke us all up because the cups in the kitchen weren't placed the way she wanted. She was basically never-ending nagging me, and the boys were miserable. 

As for me,  I enjoyed being a father; I used to take my boys outside for walks, parks, and sports events, and the boys and I were close, i was the one who went to the teacher's meeting and friend b-day parties, the boys came to me with any issue and avoided their mother i tried to encourage them and her for better communication, but my wife focused her energy into renting at them that she is busy.

 one day when I saw a message buzzing when I entered the kitchen; maybe she left a second before because her phone was unlocked. The text said: ""can't wait to be with you again, looking forward to tonight, kisses P."" I scrolled through the texts and saw that, without a doubt, she was having an affair with a guy named ""Patrick.""

My first intention to confront her quickly faded away as she entered the room and didn't mention the dirty towel on the floor. She grabbed her phone and smiled. ""What is it?"" I asked. ""Nothing, just work stuff,"" she replied. ""I have a team event, so I will be out this evening."" She didn't ask, just let me know. ""Ok, have fun."" Surprisingly, I did not feel hurt or mad. I thought I would be furious, but I realized it didn't bother me at all. I just wanted her and her nagging out of the house because the game was about to start. That night, from the moment she left, the house was quiet, and me and the boys watched the game and ate in front of the TV. My ex would disapprove of this behavior, so my sons kept asking if it was OK. I smiled and ignored the look on their faces.

Our life after that was stressful—not because of the affair; I didn't want the affair to end. It was quiet and peaceful on the days she wasn't around. When she told me that she would go for a weekend with her sister, I was thrilled! I planned an outdoor and indoor activity with my sons and another friend with kids—movies, hikes, and takeout in front of the TV. Of course, I made sure that the house would be clean when my wife got back, but she noticed, of course, that my cleaning wouldn't be acceptable. But it was worth it!

After almost a year, we sat one night for dinner. One of my sons told us a school story, and she didn't pay attention. I saw his disappointment and asked her to pay attention to him, but she didn't. To this day, I don't know why, but I said, ""I hope you don't treat Patrick like that."" She stopped and gave me a look like I was in the dungeon of hell. ""What did you say?"" The room got quiet. ""You know what I said!"" There was no coming back from that. She grabbed my arm and took me to the living room. I had never seen her face like that; it was anger combined with concern. She got herself together and asked, ""How long have you known?"" Her voice was shaky. ""About a year,"" I answered. ""What—a year?"" She suddenly realized something; her face turned to pure anger. ""A year and you never said anything?"" In that moment, I decided to go all out. ""It was peaceful, and I didn't want the boys to come from a broken home.""

She screamed, ""You've known for a year and never said anything?""

I kept my voice firm. ""Well, this is surreal—the cheater screaming at her husband.""

She looked utterly shocked and furious, a mix of confusion and rage. ""You let me continue this, thinking everything was fine, just for some peace?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""I didn't want the boys to suffer from a broken home. But seeing how you're treating them, maybe a broken home is better than this.""

That was the tipping point. That evening, she packed a suitcase and left to stay with Patrick. He came to pick her up about an hour later, and she drove off with him. The next day, she told me she wanted a divorce and eventually gave up custody.

The process was messy and took a toll on all of us. But in the end, we managed to sort out custody arrangements, and the boys stayed with me most of the time. Since then, our lives have slowly improved. I've focused on being the best father I can be, giving my boys a stable and loving environment. It's been tough, but also incredibly rewarding. We've built a new life together, one filled with more understanding, respect, and most importantly, peace. The boys have thrived at school, and I believe it's because they feel loved and secure at home.

It was the birthday party of my ex-sister-in-law's daughter. The garden was filled with colorful balloons, laughter, and the joyful chaos of children playing. I was there for the sake of my boys, who were excited to see their cousins.

As I mingled among the guests, I spotted her—Emily my EX—standing with Patrick. She looked the same, but Patrick’s expression was different. There was a look of exhaustion and frustration on his face, one that I recognized all too well.

I don't know where I found the courage, but I couldn't resist. Once Emily left his side, I took a deep breath and approached them. ""I know that look,"" I said, directing my words to Patrick.

Patrick looked startled for a moment, then let out a bitter laugh. ""You would, wouldn't you?""

I nodded. ""It took me years to understand it. The constant demands, the endless naggings need for things to be perfect...it wears you down.""

Patrick sighed, looking defeated. ""I thought I could handle it. But now I see why you...why do you seem so relieved after the divorce.""

I placed a comforting hand on Patrick’s shoulder. ""It's not easy. But sometimes, peace of mind is worth more than anything else.""

Patrick gave a small, grateful smile. ""Thanks. I needed to hear that.""

Suddenly, Emily noticed our conversation and approached us. ""What are you talking about?"" she asked coolly.

Just then, my boys ran over and climbed onto my lap, laughing and enjoying themselves. I smiled and said to Emily, ""You're not my problem anymore.""

The kids giggled softly, and Patrick looked down, a faint smile playing on his lips. Emily was clearly displeased.

I stood up, shook Patrick’s hand, and left the party, wishing my ex-in-laws a happy birthday on my way out.

A few weeks later, I got a call from an unknown number. It was Patrick. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""It's not right to be with someone else's wife, and cheating is terrible. I'm sorry I took part in it.""

I sighed and replied, ""I'm glad she no longer controls me. If you're so unhappy, maybe you should leave her.""

""It's not that simple,"" Patrick said sadly. ""But I've learned my lesson.""",1,1735217156.0,cheatingwivesbusted,0,1.0,False
1hmnneq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hmnneq/my_38f_neighbour_35f_is_transgender_and_i_dont/,My [38F] neighbour [35F?] is transgender and I don't know if I'm interested?,"I moved into a new place a few months ago with my kids (8F, 5F). I haven't really made any friends with anyone in the area, which is pretty normal for me, so I've just been dropping the kids off at daycare so they can take them to school and pick them up, going to work, collecting the kids and that's my day. Their dad isn't around much, sees them every few months, pays child support, that's about it.

A week or two in, I met my neighbour. He kept to himself and seemed really shy so I said hi one day, and he said hi back, and has been friendly since. About a month ago, I invited him over for coffee, and he's been over a lot since then. Not every day, but he'll be over at least a a couple of times a week to just hang out, talk, watch TV, that kind of thing. It's been really, really nice to have a friend nearby finally. 

Something I noticed early on is that's he's really really pretty. Like ridiculously so. Also we're in a pretty poor area with a lot of drinking and drugs, but he's into reading, gaming, sci fi movies, talking about politics and society, that kinda thing, like me. He'll play with the kids if he's over, seems to love spending time with them. He's a really gentle, kind person. All that to say, I started getting a pretty big crush on him. He's like the complete opposite of my ex, and I like that. I have to admit that I've been thinking about sex as well.

So today I took the plunge and decided to ask if he wanted to start dating. He looked kinda scared and kinda mumbled something. I said that if he wasn't interested that's cool, I'm happy to be just friends. He said, no, that's not the problem. He'd been kind of thinking about me a lot, as more than just friends, but had resigned himself to just having that. But that I needed to know that, she I guess, is transgender. I was pretty shocked. Not upset, I've never really been bothered by the idea of transgender people. But I've also never met one as far as I know. She noticed that and said it was completely fine if I wasn't interested. I said I wasn't sure, I needed time to process. She said that was understandable, but something I needed to know was that she'd be completely fine continuing our friendship if I couldn't think of her as a woman, she wouldn't judge me for it, because she knows that she still looks a lot like a guy, and it's a lot to take in. But she couldn't be the man in her relationships any more, so she'd need me to think of her that way if I wanted us to be together. That she started hormones a few months ago, and she's probably going to change over time. She looked kinda sad, like she's assuming that would be a deal breaker, said goodnight, and said she'd be happy to talk again tomorrow.

I really don't know what to do. I know dating or not is my decision, that's fine. But I don't really know how to get my head around this. I'm still not put off by this, and I let my thoughts stray over to sex again, and I still like the idea. But I want to make sure I'm respecting her wishes, and so I guess I need to think of her as a woman before I can decide whether I'd want more than friendship.",2,1735217141.0,relationship_advice,5,0.57,False

i was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for other drinks to make with the moka pot? of course i will use decaf espresso, but i was also looking into coffee alternatives that use ingredients such as mushrooms or dandelion (weird, i know. but i see people swear in the comments that the specific product being discussed tastes just like coffee!)

Before you read: 

What i mean by scroll addiction is constantly crave dopamine and have hard time getting focused on a task that gives me instant pleasure, unless its a habit that i built.

I really cant tell if im addicted to scrolling or i have ADHD. I know i have to get professionally diagnosed by a psychiatrist, but the processs will be long and time consuming. 

The reason i made this post is because whenever i drink coffee i feel super tired. And i pointed that out on reddit and people have told me this is a common ADHD symptom. 


I think i have scroll addiction but after someone pointing that feeling exhausted after drinking coffee is an adhd symptom, im kind of second guessing myself. 

I want to know if there are other symptoms that are in adhd but not in scroll addiction.

Symptoms may vary from person to person but it gives a good starting point before i commit to therapy.

1hmnl3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hmnl3a/best_friend_guilt_tripped_me_to_leave_my_house/,Best friend guilt tripped me to leave my house when I was 6.5 months pregnant ," I'm writing because I need to offload. 

We've been friends for 15 years. The first 5 years she was always positive, honest, and considerate. 

 There is a lot going on with BF but I'll get to the main issues.

BF was again going through a difficult time with her Boy friend for the 50th time, so I offered her to visit. BUT I stupidly scheduled an appointment just before she was meant to leave. Realising the morning she arrived. 

I let her know, apologized, and asked if she doesn't mind leaving one or two hours earlier. And I don't mind dropping her off or she can walk there go to shops in the way. there are coffee shops, a whole shopping centre about 5 mins away and the train was 10-15 walk away. It's a busy area. she would be waiting about 45 mins 

She seemed unhappy about this, which I got to an extent, and kept asking what the appointment was. Either I told her it's just a personal or private appointment, apologising as I realized too late to cancel. She reluctantly agreed. But throughout the weekend she kept seeming quite annoyed about it. Asking me what it was, asking if it was about my baby. At one point she realized the train was not far, and said she would walk.... But somehow kept going back... At one point she said she could always just stay at mine while I go to my appointment (she didn't ask). I told her it  was an online appointment, and I would have offered that, but we live in a two bedroom apartment and she will be able to hear me. She seemed annoyed but reluctantly went back to the plan, still defaulting to not going every now and then.

There's more stuff that happened on the day, but... It's too long as is.

The time comes... She's taking a while, But she had her stuff and was about to leave. Except... My husband walks through the door. Now my husband doesn't understand that there are some conversations you don't want to be having with guests in the other room. It's been an issue before, he also forgets what I tell him regularly. He kept suggesting ""why doesn't she just stay in the room"". Well my friend jumped on this. I won't go through the whole conversation but it was 5 mins to the appointment, and we're now trying to find another solution, but both keep defaulting to just stay in the other room. No matter how often I said I do not feel comfortable with that..I offered for her to go for a walk with my husband, I asked my husband to drop her off, I suggested coffee shops, I suggested the pub literally across the road from us and I'll drop her off after..  it kept defaulting to her staying in the other room, no matter how many times I said ""but she will hear me!"". I suggested what about you stay in the car and I'll come out as soon as I'm done. Her face dropped so low as though I had been terrible to her, I immediately felt guilty. As I was already late for the appointment... I said I'll just go to the car... Best friend immediately perked, smiled and was like ""ooooh you sure? Ok then!"".

I ran out of the apartment remembering wondering if I should feel guilty...  until I realized ""wait if it was so bad that she go outside why didn't she care that I was?""... I got to the stairs realizing how put of breath I was ""hold on I'm pregnant, if the role was reversed I would have insisted she stayed""... I finally got to the car and had a moment to settle to start my appointment when I realized something. When you are pregnant there is something (almost) everyone reminds you, what you do to yourself affects your baby, what you eat, where you go, everything. If you get stressed baby is stressed. If you are tired and exhausted baby is. At this moment I realized, it wasn't just me in my car, it was me and my baby. And it broke something inside me.

Well the appointment couldn't go ahead because no Internet, light, and phone overheated. I went inside about to cry,  o see best friend with her feet on my table laughing with husband, looking relaxed. She asked how it went, when I told her i couldn't make it work in the car nothing... She casually said ""well why don't you have it the other room"". At this point I held back the tears and just said because ""because I don't want you to hear me"". She shrugged her shoulders. I sat at my computer and tried not cry for 30 mins until I had to drop her off. She barely spoke to me during that time, just laughed wit my husband.

After that day... I don't know what happened. You know when women say they are nesting? Well I had an incredibly hormonal response. I genuinely felt like some gorilla who had just been thrown out of her nest with her baby, so some other gorilla could be comfortable in it. I'm saying this to emphasize how biological this responde was. I could breathe in my house, I could eat, I had panic attacks in my kitchen crying, I had the worst depression ever, crying for hours every day. Everytime I was at home I could feel my best friend sitting at my table telling me to go to the next room. I had this intense urge that this is not me or babies space, I need to get my baby somewhere safe. I honestly ran away for a day..my husband though I would do something stupid during this time. I honestly thought I was going to be locked up in a mental institution. This lasted months. The only place I felt safe was my car, I had to go there for hours a day just to let the emotions calm.

I confronted my friend about this mid run away, and her response was to say that it was just a misunderstanding but I didn't make it clear enough. That she should have twigged when I said I didn't want anyone to hear me but I only said it once (I said it many times).  That she was going based on what my husband was saying, and she figured if he didn't know what it was it couldn't have been a big deal or important. And that if she knew it was a big deal she would have left. And a bunch of other stuff I found personally condescending. Also apparently I didn't make it clear the appointment was private. I felt so gaslight.

When I told her that I know this was a small thing but it had a big impact on me because I was so vulnerable, her response was not to acknowledge that she should have been more considerate that I was vulnerable, but rather forgive me for my response because I was pregnant and of course vulnerable. (She did later agree she should have been more considerate of me being pregnant, but still did not apologize).

I still hurt remembering what happened to me after...

More stuff happened, like she told people what I was going through, my baby shower ended up being cancelled because of her... And generally... She was just a bull in a china shop for me.

But... She was supposed to be my friend. I get she was going through a hard time... But I don't know.",1,1735216889.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,0.67,False

However I have wanted to get with a man for many of those years as well which I suppose makes me bi but not in practice. 

I have recently started a ??? I don’t even know what as yet with a really nice guy. I’d like to at least date and explore physical intimacy with him. I am NOT looking for a partnership with him. I just want some fun and to get laid. I don’t want to catch feelings more than that. 

I don’t know if I had told him I was divorced from a woman and I appear fairly butch but he’s only seen me professionally so it’s less obvious. I am a lawyer & of a certain age. In court I look like a lawyer of a certain age.

My question is: I am not looking for a hero. I’m not particularly submissive. I can take care of myself and like to take care of myself. I am independent.

I love coffee. My mom knows I love coffee. This Christmas, she has gifted me an extremely expensive espresso machine. The kind that costs several hundred dollars.

I am not rich, and neither is she. I know for a fact my mom is living on a very tight budget and doesn't have this kind of money to freely spend on luxury products.

I do not know what to do. 

I feel extremely guilty for receiving such a gift because I honestly do not need a domestic robot covered in LCD screens to brew me italian espresso cups. 
My good old reliable filter machine is all I've ever needed since I'm the kind to gulp down cheap coffee by entire mugs rather than enjoying small cups of high-quality brewage. 

I also feel worried. In the last couple of years, my mom told me she felt guilty for the semi-impovered youth she's given me, and I'm afraid she now wants to relieve this guilt, and that she thinks gifting me this extravagant device is a way to start ""making up"" for it, while really there's nothing to apologize for since I've never felt like I've had a bad childhood despite what she seems to think.

I don't want to make her sad by telling her straight up to send the machine back and get a refund. Since I have no idea where she bought it, I don't even know if she can actually get a refund on it, and that would be risking both making her sad AND saying goodbye to her money anyway.

But I can't accept it either. Just looking at the gigantic unopened box fills me with dread, and I'm afraid that not telling her anything right now may result in her gifting me more stuff she can't afford down the line.

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.
