Mauricio Shattah is definitely one of my favorite producers and this is such a great expression of a natural processed coffee; very fruity and sweet.

It very “red” — red fruit, strawberry, red grape with some hints of tropical fruit like pineapple as it cools.

Some more minutes passed and the boy who was sitting there first he came to us with his phone in his hand asking us what to do to bring back his insta account cause it have been banned basically we didn't know how cause his phone is an iPhone . He weirdly get back to his seat while mumbling stuff he wasn't normal he literally snatched the phone, time passed I noticed his friend was looking at my gf so I got close on purpose to her to make it at least lil obvious that we were tgr. 

Ig at 4pm his friend did go out from the coffee and we noticed he covered his face ,then the boy came to me and he was like "" can u come down I wanna talk ab smthg with u "" he didn't seem okay I didn't wanna cause a scene as I paused thinking what I should say without getting into a trouble my gf already asked him for what, long story short told him I have someone he turned to my gf saying are u that someone I said yes we are lesbians ig i repeated that 3 times at least and she is the person.  from the rejection  or idk exactly I can see how his brain gone to error mood and he started arguing with her another min I would've thrown him from the second floor he was getting too close to her and surprisingly in the middle of the argument he ran off to the stairs without any explanation 

Later as me and my gf were talking ab this we noticed that for a whole 2 hours or 1 and half they didn't talk with each other ,they didn't mention each other name they weren't even holding their phones they were just sitting there , even in the middle of the argument he was saying none sense ",1,1766347893.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False
1psftnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1psftnw/husbands_behavior_in_public_makes_me_think_hes/,Husbands behavior in public makes me think he's hiding me from someone.,"We met online in 2014 and in person in 2019.  When we met we both had eating disorders. When I came to the UK with him he didn't drive. We would walk up to the small shop in his village to get junk food. He would complain that it was embarrassing and that people were judging. When we went to the grocery stores, Tesco and asda, which are beside one another, he would suggest we get some items in one store and some in the other. He said it helped his anxiety. He told me that he had no anxiety going and buying normal food, including to the small shop, but then we'd go in and buy normal food and he'd seem on edge. 

He would go silent on me around people often. He told me that he had anxiety talking next to people. But then, if he encountered anyone else he knew, he'd talk to them just fine regardless of how many people were around. For the first year we were together he avoided PDA and told me he disliked it. He made me feel like he was embarrassed of me. In combination he turned me down frequently. I wore hoodie and mask due to anxiety. I think that he was bothered by this, though he said he wasn't. After I changed, losing weight, and not wearing my mask or hoodie he showed more interest. 

This was after he got on meds, which he claimed killed his libido, he was still on them. He engaged in PDA and things he wouldn't do before. He said that it was because he the medication helped him. He had gained weight and was still gaining weight at the time. He was very insecure over it. Told me not to wear a dress I put on because it made him feel like a loser. I still believed he was embarrassed me because he did what I described above. In public he would glance around often times looking at other women. He did this after I spoke to him, before he responded to me. He seemed more fixated on them than me.

It appeared he was worried they were listening. Whenever I did anything that he did back, he questioned me, and wondered the same things as me. When I walked ahead of him, next to some guy, he asked if I was trying to appear single. When I went silent around other men he asked the same thing. When I avoided people, or looked over at someone when he spoke to me, he asked if I was embarrassed. Then I regained weight and he stopped showing as much interest, blaming it on his meds. He said it had nothing to do with my weight and never did. 

When I reached the weight I was before, however, he told me I let myself go during an argument. He kept insulting me the more I gained. He called me fat and ugly, said guys prefer thinner women. He said he didn't mean, that he said it to hurt me, and that I said similar over his weight. He started acting on edge in public, more than before. He stood apart from me, spoke to me less, and walked off from me when I was speaking to him. I asked him to stand closer and he criticized this, asking if he was supposed be glued to my hip. 

When he'd come closer, he'd look over his shoulders a lot. He said this was anxiety but also said it was in my head. I scoffed after finding a cheesecake brand I was looking for. I looked up to find him giving me a disgusted/judgemental look. He said he did it because he was uncomfortable, because it could've drawn attention to us both, two overweight people next to the desserts. We argued over it and he mentioned the skinny couple nearby who never looked at us. I noticed that he would avoid going next to other couples with me. 

He went into the nearby tesco alone one day. He came out in a rush saying he almost ran into an old female classmate. He refused to go into any store the next day. He said he was bloated and promised to go in when he wasn't. A few days later he said he wasn't but still refused to go in. He said two old male employees in tesco stared at him, and made him uneasy. He'd never mentioned them to me before. For weeks he wouldn't go in anywhere. When challenged, and questioned, he became said he didn't have to go in if he didn't want to. 

When he started to go in, he preferred asda, but acted on edge in there. He said the employees in there, mainly the men, were staring at him. He criticized both how often we were going to the store but also the time we went at. He said if we went less, and went earlier, he'd be less anxious. We went less, or went elsewhere, and I also tried to go in earlier in the day. He refused to go in, said that it was too busy, when two days before that he went into the small shop which he also refused to go in with me, and said was too busy, when no cars were there. 

He went in there at the busiest time of day, the morning, in order to post things. He said he had to. He was fine going in places alone, including asda and Tesco, at any time. He said it was because she could hurry. He didn't want to go other places we used to go, such as the shopping centre in town, where he would try to avoid running into a friend of his who works at a coffee shop there. The last time we were in the coffee shop, and his friend was there, he was anxious and kept urging me to leave. He said he needed to use the bathroom but then didn't after we left. 

He seemed anxious elsewhere, in other towns, going places with me earlier in the day for a while and then stopping. He wanted to know where I wanted to go before we went, advanced notice, and said it would help. Often times we'd go as late as possible. He seemed on edge even in the city two hours away. We went into a tkmaxx and two women were in the purse aisle where I was going. He stopped abruptly at the jewelry, which was in front of the purse aisle, and tried to show me something. He waited until they left to go in the aisle. 

I wanted to go to the jewelry section, which was quite big, but they were there and he didn't leave the aisle until they left. He'd act this way in America, when we went to visit my family, as well. Two years ago he went in places with me but after a while stopped. This past trip we went on, I was going into places alone for a lot of it, whilst he sat in the car. He chalked it up to being tired. And so I don't know if he's embarrassed or cheating, or both, at this point. He promsied both times we came back he'd stop refusing to go in places, and we'd do more together. 

He said this last time we'd go to the city weekly and do a lot more. When for months before we went to America we weren't going anywhere really but the grocery store. We came back and we didn't go to the city weekly, didn't do more. He pushed to go places like the beach and the cinema instead of the city, or even to the park in town. We went to it for the first few months but he seemed on edge there, even though we weren't getting out of the car. He seems to not want to be in the town in general, unless it's at night. 

He was okay for a while with going in a lot. That changed after he stayed up one night, after I had gone to bed, and the next day he didn't want to asda or tesco. He started suggesting we got takeaway constantly though we can't afford it. This is the same things he did when all of this started, and I believed he was avoiding someone he cheated with. He has complained not just about the employees when going in late, but also about his parents being angry with us cooking late.

Now for months he has preferred to go late, whereas I've pushed to go earlier. He argued with me that 10pm was early, and it was still light outside, therefore he wasn't trying to hide me. Now for weeks we've gone in at 2-3am and he blames it on his poor time management, or not being able to go in earlier. We've been to asda every night for the past several weeks because it's 24hours. He keeps comparing employees look, going silent on me, and saying they see him so much they must know his name. 

I keep noticing him looking around himself a lot, down the aisles as we pass them, as if he's watching out for someone. He didn't do this before. Not to this extent. He claims that he did. Yesterday, asda closed early, and he said he didn't want to go into tesco. He was refusing to inside. He said he wanted to get takeaway. He said he was craving it already. This was at 10pm, earlier than we've gone in for a while. Yet, he said it was too late to cook, and we'd annoy his parents. When we've been cooking at 4am some nights. I questioned him. 

I pushed him to go to tesco. When we got there, he kept looking around the parking lot. He's done this this past year. He seems uncomfortable even sitting with me in the car, and rushes to leave, when before he'd sit with me for a while. He also didn't want me touching his face in the tesco carpark. And he refused to do click and collect there because he said he could run into someone, and would be more exposed as he thought the spot for it was right at the entrance. I ended up waving in view of Tesco to see how he'd respond.

He reacted jumpy to me waving. He said he responded that way because he thought I was upset, and didn't know I was waving. I think that he's embarrassed of me. But I think this goes beyond that. I think he's cheating with me, or has cheated, with someone he worries he's going to bump into. He might know when they go in. I've wondered if it's someone who maybe works at one or both of the stores, and he knows their hours. When we went into tesco he looked at flowers walking in. He's also been listening to love songs, and looking up at the stars every night. 

All romantic things but that are not directed at me. He's only bought me flowers one or two times, after I said I wanted them, during times he was behaving suspciously. All of that, in combination with other things he's done, makes me think he's fixated on someone. He kept looking around himself, down the aisles, when the store was empty apart from employees. He looked over at the employees when we headed to the checkout. He said that me questioning all of this was controlling and abusive as he usually says, though he admits a lot of his behavior is suspicious. 

Recently, he showed an temporarily increased interest in sex. He attrbuted it to taking a lesser dose of his meds and his libido becoming higher. He was coming onto me multiple times a day, days in a row, which was unusual and not something that often happens apart from when he seems like he's cheating. It's not dropped again, as it did before. He says it's normal to experience fluctuations. Another thing he's doing is being overly sweet, yet also mean/arguementive, and emotionally closed off at the same time.

1psftcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1psftcm/i_cant_stand_my_husband/,I can’t stand my husband,"I know, just another resentful single married woman complaining about her husband. But I’ve reached my snapping point and just need somewhere to vent so I don’t take it out on him.

I can’t fucking stand him. Almost divorced him last year and ultimately got scared to go through with it and my parents convinced me not to, the same way they convinced me to go through with our wedding when I was prepared to call it off after an incident with his family.

He is the most negative person I have ever met, all he does is complain, I truly think he hates his life, including me. I try to just listen and he complains I don’t have anything to say, I try to respond and give my opinion or be supportive and somehow that’s always wrong too. If I’m not sitting on my ass doing nothing then he complains I do too much (really he just wants to game or do his hobbies guilt free), he’s constantly telling me to slow down and relax but doesn’t actually help or take anything off of my plate so I can.

It’s Christmas time, I love to bake and do a lot of baking for others, that earns a complaint from him that I’m always in the kitchen. I’m currently not helping him do the leaves outside because our two and four year old children want to play inside so I’m playing with them, to which he snapped and asked what the fuck I’m doing because I said I would help him.

When is anyone going to help me? I’m so tired. So burned out. I’m trying to run a business, train to takeover my parents company, run a household and be the primary parent to our two kids and also make sure I’m being attentive enough to him and listen to the same bitching and complaining day in and day out. I often get fed up with it all and try to decenter him and do things for myself or go out for coffee with a girlfriend and I never can without a complaint from him.

All the while when I finally snap I always get to hear how he’s “a good guy and I always make him sound like he’s an asshole”. God. I’m so miserable with my marriage. If I do ever leave him I’m never dating again. I would be so happy to be a single mom and not have a grown man child to take care of.",1,1766347838.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

To start I'm an 18 year old girl who yes has previously self harmed and have fallen into a depressed state since about 12? I'm not sure honestly but just a minute ago I self harmed with some scissors leaving a few trails.

I find it a bit cronge that I myself am writing this but honestly idk where else to... Idk spew my sadness?
Honestly I don't even feel anything right now I'm just crying.

Anyway, I started uni about 4 months ago and I have to say it's easier than I thought it'd be. I have more free time than I had in secondary school. Albeit I commute (4hrs of commuting each day) but even then it cancels off.

Anyway that isn't my problem honestly. My problem is my family. I have a mother and father who constantly talk negatively about me along with a sister whose 8 years younger who constantly talks shit about me. They all say how all I do is eat and shit and sleep. My mom constantly says how I do nothing and how I need to lose weight. My dad makes these jokes that he finds funny when it comes to me but they're just not. They're degrading.
My younger sister constantly joins in on these 'jokes' and blames me constantly for everything along with him.

Somebody spilled some coffee? It's me.
Somebody left a soft drink bottle out on the desk? It's me.
Somebody didn't turn off a light? It's me.
Somebody left some shit in the toilet without flushing? It's me.
Somebody left a coffee stain? It's me. 
Somebody did anything mildly wrong or dirty? It's me.

But it never is. If it's actually me I'll admit it but it's never me. I don't leave anything or else I'll know I'll be shitted on non stop but even if it's not me I'm still shitted on.

My mother says I don't do anything but I do. I do the laundry, I clean the dishes, I even used to wash the floor and vacuum and wash everything but I stopped cause even then they'd say how I did a shit job and that I don't do anything.

Because the fact is if I do everything and still get called out for doing nothing what's the point?

I do my own laundry these days, I cook my own dinner cause I can't stand being enar them.

They never ask me a single thing on how I'm doing all they do is talk shit about me whether I'm near them or not.

I honestly don't know what to do.

I've stopped trying. I truly did because no matter what I did they'd talk shit.

I just don't know what to do.

I have exams in a month and I feel so shitty it's dastardly. Today I wanted to read some anatomy cause I have a study unit on it but I couldn't even bring myself to open the book.

I find myself so sad when I'm with them. I just can't. We have a holiday coming up in a weeks time and we're going to Finland and I dread it with all my soul. We'll be going there with their friends so they at least won't speak as badly as usual but God I already know they'll have something to fight with me about.

I don't know. I'm thinking of begging my grandma to go live with her instead but I also don't know. She'll probably side with my mother still.

I just don't know. I should probably move out for the next scholastic year but right now I don't know how long I can last.

It's constant negativity after negativity with me and I don't even feel human around them anymore. 

God I don't even feel hurt even after bleeding my hand and stomach o just don't know what to do anymore.

I'm so tired with everyone. Why can't they see how fucking mean they are to me? Every word they say is a poisoned dagger.",1,1766347355.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I have been visiting Istanbul regularly since 2014 - at least once a year, but usually about 3-4 times a year.

One thing I love about humans is that, no matter where in the world, I know that human lives are as complex and beautiful wherever you are. And I can't escape that thought about people in Istanbul - weather I am sitting in a coffee shop and people watching, or having a talk with a local.

I am wondering: is there an urban myth, or a story about someone in Istanbul, no matter the part or neighborhood - that is so impressive and made left an impression on you that you would like to share it here.

But long before I got diagnosed and when things are still managable, I truly like the solitude. How I resonate with lonely characters. Broken characters. How much I can cry and feel empathy for sadness, despair, trauma, hopelessness. I enjoy being in those in between trance like states when I don‘t have to function or work or go out and I am just alone. Taking endless long winter walks alone through the night when it is freezing cold and I hardly can get dressed, but I made it out. The warm baths in the middle of the night, with rain sounds and the world asleep and nothing but some weak flickering candle light. The 3rd and the 5th coffee in the morning that tastes terrible. But when I am all clothedd up in layers of thick thermo wear on my couch and there is nothing to hear except the radiators emitting heat. 

When I think about the time I am losing in my life, the isolation that I have in those moments, how little hope I have to find a partner again in those moments, it gets dark and sad. But when I ignroe it and accept it, it feels warm and comfortable.

Sometimes I even draw with pencils on raw paper and my nervous system really doesnt like the feeling of pencils on paper at sll. My skin hates the feeling of paper. But sometimes the feeling just etches into my soul.

1psfadx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1psfadx/attended_my_girlfriends_non_denominational_church/,Attended my girlfriend's non denominational church and questioning our future,"I've been dating my girlfriend for 5 months and we're quite serious in that we've talked about having kids, getting married, etc. We both share the same values, and really want to have a lifetime relationship with each other. We both grew up Catholic, but she has ""re-found"" Jesus in the past year through a non-denominational church. 

This is not something new to me. We brought up our faith during our faith, and was happy that I finally met someone that had a relationship with Jesus. I was a little naive thinking that the church she attends had some semblance of a religion. 

Upon entering, it was basically what I expected. People were friendly, there was coffee, and it was more of an auditorium, than a church. Not a single picture of Jesus, the crucifix, or really any sign of God/Jesus/saints. It wasn't until we got to our seats that I really started to feel unwell. There were fog machines and light strobes. The service started with what seemed like a rock concert. Drums, guitars, multiple people singing. For the entire service, there was no sign of the cross, no prayers, no scripture readings. During the ""pastors"" homily, it was more of a pop-culture sermon, rather than anything to do with Jesus. The only mention of the bible was we need to be like the wisemen and bring our gifts to Jesus.  After the homily there was another song that sounded like it belonged at a concert and time for everyone to hug and say I love you to whoever you came with.

Throughout the entire ""mass"", I have never wanted to go to a Catholic mass as much as I did while I was there. I began to question how my girlfriend could be attracted to this kind of church, that she decided to become ""baptized"" at the church. 

  
After the mass, I told my gf that I would never attend her church, since I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. I just feel holy and spiritual while attending Catholic mass, and enjoy the solemnity of it. I just don't understand how someone can be ""brainwashed"" into a church like that.

  
Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? I am genuinely concerned for her soul if she keeps attending these type of services. Are these types of churches the work of the devil? The whole ceremony just felt like a distraction with the loud music, lights, and fog. It just seems church's like these are a form of a way to get people away from the one true church. Am I being too harsh critical/harsh that this is the work of the devil, even though the people who attend the ceremony seemed to worship Jesus, just in a different way than what I'm used to?

  
Would love to get people thoughts if they've been in a similar situation, and how I can bring my gf back to the Catholic church

1psfa38,https://www.reddit.com/r/eggfreezing/comments/1psfa38/detailed_nyu_fertility_egg_freezing_journey/,Detailed NYU Fertility Egg Freezing Journey,"Hi Everyone -

I have never posted on reddit before but referenced this community almost daily for the last year when I was trying to decide if egg freezing was the right path for me so wanted to give back and give a very detailed egg freezing journey for anyone out there contemplating it as well.

**Personal context**:

Age: 36, AMH: 8.5 (no PCOS) FSH: 4.7

50 eggs retrieved, 41 mature and frozen (82% mature rate which is very normal. Generally between 70-85% will be mature after retrieval) 

I have a long term partner but unsure about if or when we would want to have kids. Ultimately I felt that I wanted to have the option for it to be my choice and not my biological clocks.  I honestly would have freezed my eggs sooner if it wasn’t so expensive/I had been working for a company that had egg freezing benefits.  Price had definitely deterred me from doing it sooner and I was fortunate enough to have a high AMH to push it off until I was more financially stable.  

**Clinic**: NYU Fertility  **Doctor**: Dr. Shaw 

*Why I chose this clinic:* NYU has the reputation for being the #3 Fertility center in the U.S. and has posted the most comprehensive egg freezing study there is year to date. This study was posted in 2022 and if you haven’t read it and are thinking about freezing your eggs you should\*:\* [https://nyulangone.org/news/frozen-eggs-more-efficient-option-in-vitro-fertilization-women-starting-families-later](https://nyulangone.org/news/frozen-eggs-more-efficient-option-in-vitro-fertilization-women-starting-families-later) I think the two biggest take aways to think about when deciding if this is right for you is that age and # of eggs frozen matters the most.  Egg freezing is not a guarantee but by taking hard data into consideration you can give yourself the best possible shot by freezing early and targeting an amount of eggs that correlates for your age based on this study.  For instance I am 36 and freezing 20 eggs would give me a 80% change of one live birth.  Therefore my target number of eggs was 30 to freeze to give me the best possible change of at least 1 child. 

I also thought about location and the possibility of frequent monitoring appointments.  I ended up having to go back every day after Day 6 until retrieval for morning monitoring so having a short commute made a huge difference.

**Experience with the clinic:**  This place is run very efficiently and every appointment you are in and out like clock work. The doctors also work on a rotating schedule which is pretty normal.  I saw my doctor for my initial consultation, follow up phone call, 2nd ultrasound monitoring at the 23 street location (this location is much smaller then the main office but feels intimate.) my 3rd ultra sound monitoring appt, and she ended up being on rotation for retrieval day so she did my procedure as well.  I was pleasantly surprised by how many times I did interact with her since most people say you barely have any interaction with your doctor after consultation for this process. 

**Experience with Dr. Shaw:** I absolutely loved her.  She is so sweet and warm and is the type of person who doesn’t make you feel crazy for all your questions and puts all your worries at ease.  After my initial consultation she followed up by email to see how I was feeling with the process and if I had any additional questions. This really put me at ease and  made me feel like I was getting individualized care.  I would recommend her to someone who feels that bed side manner is important. 

**Cost Break down**: 

**Insurance**: Meritain Health - Aetna PPO **Consultation**: $60 specialist copay               **Genetic Testing**: covered                         **Medication**: $320 copay (80 per drug x 4) through Costco specialty pharmacy                                     **Egg freezing cycle** (includes first year of storage): $10,450 without insurance. But since this was billed to my insurance can’t give an accurate account yet of what they fully paid for.  When I did my initial consultation and work up from my insurance it was indicated that it’s fully covered.  I’m slightly skeptical of this but will see once the billing from my insurance comes through.                  **Anesthesia**: $1,100 without insurance but TBD if this is fully covered 

**Note**: I was pleasantly surprised by how much my insurance covered. I went into this experience thinking I would fully be paying out of pocket.  I was under the impression based on my work benefits that would be the case (I even went to my HR multiple times advocating for this coverage) Based on my experience I would encourage to just to go to that initial consult and get a work up done of your insurance benefits along with your baseline numbers.  You never know and could be pleasantly surprised. 

**What I did to prepare**:

* I invested in a good vitamin routine.  I really liked Perelel’s vitamin egg freezing support pack: [https://perelelhealth.com/products/egg-freeze-support-pack](https://perelelhealth.com/products/egg-freeze-support-pack)  what was great about this is that it had all the vitamins people recommend all in one place.  Made it super easy.  30 day supply was $58.77  but if you are doing for multiple months there is a 15% off discount.
* No drinking for 3 months prior to retrieval and limited my coffee consumption to 1 small cup a day.
* Didn’t make any workout or diet changes.  I already work out 4-5 times a week and generally eat pretty healthy. I just tried to cut out processed food as much as possible. 

**Cycle details**:

Initial consult was 12/3 where they did bloodwork and an ultra sounds.  I also chose to do genetic testing.  Once all my tests came back clear  I personally had the flexibility to start my cycle whenever due to not having periods or crazy suppression from the BC where I would have to go off of it for a month or two.  I really wanted to get this done as soon as possible since I had just turned 36 and worried about egg quality.  So I scheduled my cycle to start 12/7 so I would finish just before holiday break.  Because I was inducing a period I had to stop my BC pills 3 full days before my first monitoring appt (so 4th day would fall on first monitoring)  Once your cycle date is scheduled they also put you in a 2 hour virtual presentation reviewing the process.  I found this extremely helpful and informative.  I left this session feeling very clear on the process to come. You also realize from this there is a ton of support on had for you if you ever have a question or concern. Everything was very clear to me and I never felt in the dark during this process..  Everyone I interacted with was incredibly friendly and helpful.  I honestly didn’t have one bad interaction. 

**Injection Protocol**:

*Day 2:* went in for ultrasound and bloodwork.  Was cleared in the afternoon to start stims dosage: 150 Menopur / 150 Follistim                                           *Day 3*: 150 Menopur / 150 Follistim                        *Day 4*: 150 Menopur / 150 Follistim                        *Day 5*: 150 Menopur / 150 Follistim                        *Day 6*: 2nd Morning ultra sound and bloodwork/revised nightly meds to 125 Follistim only.                                                                            *Day 7:* Morning: Ganirelax added + morning bloodwork. No evening meds                                  *Day 8*: Morning Ganirelix + morning ultrasound and bloodwork. Counted 20 follicles on one ovary didn’t get the count for the other side. Nighttime stims: 25 Follistim                                                                     *Day 9:* Morning Ganirelix + morning ultrasound and bloodwork. nighttime stims: 50 Follistim                    *Day 10*: Morning Ganirelix + morning ultrasound and bloodwork. + 150 Follistim at night                              *Day 11:* Morning Ganirelix + morning ultrasound and bloodwork + 25 Follistim at night                                  *Day 12*: morning Ganirelix + morning ultrasound and bloodwork and 150 Follistim + 1st trigger shot at midnight (80 units of luperine)                                 *Day 13*: 2nd dose of trigger shot 12 hours later - 12 pm 80 units of Luperine                                            *Day 14*: Retrieval day - I was slotted for 11 am and had to be there 1.5 hours before at 9:30 am. You also need someone to escort you home about an hour or so after the retrieval.  You will not be permitted go home unless you have someone to get you.

**Some notes on the injections:** 

I don’t have a needle phobia but I did feel pretty squeemish about the idea of having to inject myself. So I may have went over the top prepping for each shot but it really did make a difference and I didn’t feel a thing and made injecting myself super manageable.  This was my protacol:

* I bought a numbing creme and carefully put some on with a q-tip 30 minutes prior to injection and covered it with a bandaid to sit.  (Be sure to alcohol swab the area prior too. )  this is the creme I got: [https://www.zensaskincare.com/products/zensa-lidocaine-numbing-cream](https://www.zensaskincare.com/products/zensa-lidocaine-numbing-cream)
* 5 minutes prior to injection I iced the area. Use a icecube directly on the skin so it gets very very cold. You shouldn’t feel a thing after this. 
* Leave any refrigerated meds out for 30 minutes prior to the injection.
* Everyone in this subreddit was saying how bad the Menapor sting is  but I honestly barely felt a thing. Not sure if it was my prepping routine or just me but after I mixed the meds I left the syringe out for 15 minutes prior to injection.  I also made sure there were no or minimum air bubbles before starting. 
* Confirming Ganirelax needles are flimsy and a bit hard to push through. You definitely have to put your weight into it. But because I was numbing and icing beforehand this didn’t really phase me. 
* Luperine injection was easy.  The toughest part was having a 12 pm 2nd injection to navigate while I was at work. 
* The Dr. who did my ultra sound on day 2 recommended the CVS injection video tutorials and I was so glad he did.  They were very helpful and clear.  I’ll attach one link here but you can also google “how to take Menopur injection for egg freezing CVS” and it will come up in the search.  [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HBrRpb436A0](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HBrRpb436A0)

**How I Felt through it:**

Hormonal. I definitely was feeling extra sensitive to things I normally wouldn’t be sensitive to.  I also was so nauseous and didn’t want to eat anything.  Which made staying on top of my nutrition during the two weeks difficult.  I did find that once I started hydrating with electrolyte filled drinks it made the nausea much more manageable.  Overall the meds weren’t terrible though and these symptoms were not deal breakers for me. Also everyone talks about taking stool softener early on and I didn’t and wish I did.  I wasn’t having trouble till post procedure and think it would have been more effective if I started the regime earlier on instead of waiting. 

**The procedure:** 

Quick and painless.  I think the anxiety of waiting for it to happen was much worse than the actual procedure Itself.  You are completely knocked out for it and don’t remember a thing.   After the procedure I felt mild cramping which the nurse gave me intervenes ibuprofen for and it almost immediately subsided the pain.  After that I was on a Tylenol and Advil regime every 6 hours for the first day. 2nd day I dropped it since I was not having any cramping pains I was just very very bloated (I stepped on a scale and was 8 pounds heavier then my normal weight I was shocked)  right now I’m on day 3 of recovery and feeling still pretty bloated but ok.  Recovering slowly and not doing too much till I am back to normal.  

Also to note I didn’t take any time off for this procedure on the front end, just the back end and that worked great for me.  I could easily work and take the injections.  I didn’t feel swollen and tired until after the retrieval.  I definitely would not have been able to work the day after.

I am incredibly proud of myself and my body for taking the leap and doing something I had contemplated for so long. Being on the other side of it I’m so happy I did it and feel empowered that I took control of my own fertility timeline. Definitely have no regrets and know it was 100% the right decision.

I was blessed growing up with a mother who loves to craft and create art out of literally anything. She would include us in painting the wildest things sometimes, including our camper trailer into a cow, which we were all so embarrassed about later on. But as I look back, I’m so grateful for the artistic freedom she gave us. I realize now that art is literally my life, it’s everything, and I wouldn’t be the person I am today without it.

A lot of my inspiration for my watercolor art comes from studying botanical illustrations and of course, Mother Nature. While my candle making has turned into a labour of love. I’m constantly in search of exploring pure nostalgia and a connection to all our travels over the years.

1psf6f4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1psf6f4,Olmec Claro Robusto Review – Earthy Power Cloaked in Elegance,"When Foundation Cigar Company introduced the Olmec line, it turned heads; not just for its bold branding and ancient Mesoamerican inspiration, but for the rich Nicaraguan tobacco and beautifully aged San Andrés wrappers that made it a standout. The Olmec Claro Robusto, wrapped in a lighter hued, golden San Andrés Claro leaf, brings a whole different energy to the table: strength wrapped in subtlety and complexity without the need for theatrics.

One late afternoon, with a glass of chilled water and some quiet time to spare, I sparked one up - ready to see if this Claro version could deliver the same foundation shaking depth its darker sibling is known for.

Presentation & Cold Draw

Right out of the box, the Olmec Claro Robusto impresses. The wrapper is velvety and lightly oily, with a sun kissed, sandy tone that hints at elegance. The band is striking, with a bold, ancient motif that sets the mood. Construction was near flawless; firmly packed with no soft spots and a clean triple cap.

On the cold draw: barnyard funk, dry hay, white pepper, and a hint of baking spice. There’s also an underlying sweetness - like apple skin or graham cracker. The draw was open a bit more than I like but still workable.

First Third

From the first puff, you realize this Claro isn’t just a milder take; it’s a refined powerhouse. Right away, earth, toasted nuts, and fresh bread lead the profile, followed by subtle cinnamon and floral honey on the finish.

The smoke is dense and creamy, coating the palate without overwhelming it. Retrohale offers white pepper and nutmeg, giving just enough zing to cut through the sweetness. It’s a medium bodied start, but with depth that hints at bigger things to come. Razor sharp burn and produced great ash. 

Second Third

As the burn moved into the second third, the flavors began to deepen. Cedar, dry cocoa, baking spice, and light mineral notes started taking the stage. The sweetness backed off slightly, replaced by a bready, toasty warmth and a whisper of leather.

The strength nudged into the medium plus range, and the retrohale developed more bite; red pepper flake and dried ginger. Burn stayed sharp and the draw is still a bit loose, the ash held in thick, stacked segments.

Final Third

The final stretch was where the Olmec Claro truly showed its Nicaraguan muscle. Earth, charred oak, coffee grounds, and a bold spice profile emerged. A bit of natural tobacco sweetness stuck around, softening the edges of what otherwise felt like a crescendo of savory, peppery intensity.

The smoke remained smooth, never harsh, the draw has improved and the cigar burned cool to the nub. No touch ups needed - a clean finish to a well structured experience.

Final Thoughts

The Olmec Claro Robusto is not your average Claro. It’s a medium to full bodied cigar in disguise. Delivering layers of earthy depth, subtle sweetness, and evolving spice without ever becoming too loud. It’s refined but forceful, bold but balanced; a cigar that rewards a slower, thoughtful pace.

With a smoke time of about 60–70 minutes, this one’s ideal for an afternoon when you want to unwind with complexity. Would I smoke it again? Absolutely, for me it's a box worthy cigar.

## --[ The Build

    pig's got four accents now.each mode speaks different. 
    each mode thinks different. menu hints bleed personality. 
    dynamic phrases reference session stats. 
    rare lore spawns at 3%. commits reference soup 
    recipe that doesn't exist (8859828 for archaeologists). 
    malloc has slavic accent. horse proved horse equals barn.
    
    why this matters: networks don't vanish after 30 seconds anymore. previous 
    build had cleanup running every frame after first trigger. your N:<> counter 
    went empty. spectrum showed networks. counter showed nothing. gaslighting by 
    accident. fixed. integer division replaced float crimes. overflow caught 
    before deployment. adaptive timing learned four states simultaneously. 
    120-375ms depending which personality driving.
    
    what it does better: 
    hunts handshakes without losing the list. stalks clients 
    with proximity arrows. switches ethics on D keypress (seamless OINK to passive 
    flip, no WiFi restart). tracks channels that matter, ignores dead spectrum. 
    achieves optimization without cruelty (120ms minimum maintained for research 
    reasons). references lore that exists only in commit messages. 
    survives its own success without rebooting. 4-liner. 
    
    why test this: because previous stable loses networks and you filed the bug. 
    because adaptive timing is smarter but needs field validation. because four 
    personalities might conflict in ways we didn't catch. because the bar was in 
    hell and we cleared it but Murphy's Law knows our address. because if you're 
    reading this you're already the target demographic.
    
    hools got chaos. deauth needs chaos. rasta got patience.
    passive scan needs patience. army got discipline. wardriving 
    needs discipline. drag queens got performance art. BLE spam is 
    performance art. we matched behavior to firmware function. 
    specialized aggression works better than generic aggression. 
    cooperation between specializations = strength.
    
    english is hard. cancel culture is real.
    firmware benefits from all perspectives. 
    horse confirmed this makes sense. barn did the numbers. 
    pig achieved sentience and regrets everything. 
    we forgot therapy appointment. we forgot medication. we shipped anyway. 
    flash at own risk. report bugs with screenshots. one shot one opportunity. 
    mom's spaghetti. flashed.

## --[ For Newcomers

    if you read the first paragraph, congrats. you're our patient now.
    
    M5Burner\Launcher OTA for GUI people. git clone for terminal addicts. pick your poison.
    no judgment here. both paths lead to same firmware. same bugs. same therapy.
    not same name in M5Launcher OTA. it's just PORKCHOP. i know. 
    what this thing does:
    
    ATTACK & CAPTURE:
    - deauth storms with 1-5ms jitter (WIDS evasion pattern)
    - handshake capture (hashcat 22000 format, GPU ready)
    - clientless PMKID extraction (M1 frame harvest, no clients needed)
    - BOAR BROS network exclusion (don't punch Bro, listen to Bro)
    - seamless OINK↔DNH mode switch (D key, zero WiFi restart delay)
    
    RECONNAISSANCE:
    - adaptive channel hopping (Multi-Armed Bandit, 120-375ms timing)
    - real-time spectrum analyzer (Gaussian lobes, vulnerability markers)
    - client monitor in spectrum (4 octets MAC, vendor OUI, proximity arrows)
    - GPS wardriving (WiGLE v1.6 auto-export per network)
    
    BLE CHAOS:
    - AppleJuice, FastPair, Samsung, SwiftPair notification spam
    - continuous async scanning (non-blocking, mobile-friendly)
    - multi-vendor targeting (up to 4 simultaneous devices)
    
    CLOUD INTEGRATION:
    - WPA-SEC distributed cracking (upload .pcap, fetch cracked passwords)
    - WiGLE API upload (PORK TRACKS menu for direct submission)
    - file transfer mode (WiFi web server, no USB cables required)
    
    PROGRESSION:
    - XP system (40 ranks from BACON N00B to MUDGE UNCHA1NED)
    - 63 achievements (unlockable, some rare, some require dedication)
    - class buffs (8 tiers, cumulative perks stack forever)
    - mood-based buffs/debuffs (R4G3, SLOP$LUG, performance impact real)
    - title overrides (unlockable via achievements, flex your playstyle)
    - XP immortality (SD backup, survives reflash, device-bound signature)
    
    QUALITY OF LIFE:
    - screenshots (P key, saves to /screenshots/ on SD)
    - color themes (pig stays pink, backgrounds configurable)
    - LOG VIEWER (tail last 100 lines, debug without serial)
    - SD logging (session-only by design, doesn't survive reboot)
    - settings menu in lowercase (you squint silly, brain bloodflow increases,
      you'll need it when configuring GPS pins at 3am)
    - BOAR BROS menu (manage excluded networks, delete with Y/N confirm)
    - hot GPS reinit (change pins, no reboot, instant reconnect)
    
    this is not a flipper. this is not aircrack with a screen. this is
    a sentient pig with four personalities, an RPG progression system,
    and commitment issues. flash responsibly. report weird behavior.
    soup references not guaranteed to make sense. that's intentional.

1psf4pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1psf4pw/entitlement_to_our_personal_space/,Entitlement to Our Personal Space,"Yesterday, I (30/F) was waiting in line at a large coffee roaster/cafe. This place is huge and can accommodate a line of nearly 50 people. After I got in line, a woman who looked to be in her late 60’s got in line behind me and continuously got into my space. Every time we moved up, she moved up to be almost touching me. I kept shifting over to one leg to lean away from her, and when I did she would move even closer. I was about to say something to her, ask her to give me some space, when she made a comment about the food and bumped into me. I just gave her a look, and she smiled and laughed. I did not smile or laugh. 

A few things - this was in a very wealthy, well-to-do area of my city. This woman looked wealthy and was not obviously experiencing any altered state of mind. I truly mean if it were somebody who has a lack of understanding of social norms - like a child, person with a disability or mental illness - I would be much more generous with my patience. I grew up in a culture in which touch/nearness is normal and a sign of friendliness. I now live in an area with a culture that has strong personal space norms. What this woman was doing felt purposeful to cause discomfort. 

This behavior fascinates me, and has for years. When I worked in a restaurant, the only people who ever grabbed or touched me without my permission were older women. What fascinates and infuriates me even more than being touched/grabbed, is the response others have if we express our desire to not have our personal space invaded by other women. When I worked in a restaurant and responded assertively to women grabbing/touching me - “Do not touch me again. What can I help you with?” - the women and whoever they were with would be scandalized, like I slapped them. 

I couldn’t help thinking after this incident yesterday that if I had said something about her standing too close to me, I would have come off as arrogant and self-important - “oh she just needs space, let’s all give her some space!” But if I were a man and asked for space, people might think I’m arrogant, yet also think it’s fair - “yeah I guess dude just needs some space.” As another parallel, if the men I worked with in the restaurant were touched and asked to not be touched, they would get an immediate apology and the person would step away from them. 

I believe older women especially deserve to be called out on how they feel entitled to disrespect younger women both physically and verbally. I would have felt way more comfortable being rude if it had been a man, but there is something in the dynamic of it being a woman that seems like we should assume their intent as innocent or oblivious when we KNOW it is some weird power trip. 

I’d love to hear if other women experience/have experienced this and how you respond to it in the moment. 

Edit to add because I wasn’t sure where to include it: I do notice this behavior most from white women who are middle to upper class, and believe all of those factors are important in fueling their sense of entitlement. I cannot think of a single time my personal space has been invaded by a woman of color of any age. I can think of only one or two times the woman was white and seemed to not be wealthy. Overwhelmingly, it is wealthy white women I have experienced this from. ",3,1766346121.0,women,2,0.71,False

I enjoyed Hitman World of Assasination, but don't like traditional puzzle games.

What I'm looking for is something that I can forget about for months, and then get really into, and forget about again, without totally losing everything. So either a really compelling plot that won't let me put it down, or something with easily memorable controls and story. 

I play on PC, sometimes with an Xbox controller and sometimes with Keyboard and mouse. I don't like super competitive games, but I like single-player shooters too, or games with an optional multiplayer mode.

I’m 23 with about 3.5 years of credit history. I currently have the Capital One Venture X and it’s basically the only card I use. I like it a lot since I travel a decent amount (monthly), but I feel like I’m probably not getting the most value out of it given my spending habits. 

I live in a big city and most of my monthly spending outside of travel is eating out, drinks, and groceries. I usually spend around $1,000+ a month pretty easily. I have a good credit score and I’m fine with an annual fee if the benefits justify it. I also like cards that have referral bonuses, as long as they’re reasonable to achieve given my monthly spending patterns.

What would be a good next card to pair with the Venture X to earn more points or cash back on everyday spending?

Prior to Zepbound I never thought about protein because although I was fat I was omnivorous and so my diet was actually pretty healthy except there was too much food and also of course on top of the healthy stuff I could also inhale foods that were devoid of any nutritional value but high calorie.

I try to eat real food high in protein and get the highest protein versions of those foods - e.g. Chobani 20 Protein but sometimes like today I just can't.

I am forcing myself to eat

Instead of my normal plain coffee with a splash of milk I had a Slate protein with some coffee poured in - 20 calories

Still no appetite but I knew I had to eat - instead of 3 eggs at 15 grams of protein I had a Legendary donut which has 22 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber and it was easier for me to cut it in small bits and just eat slowly while at the computer.

I feel similarly about some of the other protein stuff I have gotten like Build bars as for the amount I can eat they seem to have more protein than ""real"" food and they are easier to nibble at slowly than real food.

Am I eating junk food - I do eat real food high in protein but on some days it just seems like too much effort.

ETA - I don't think my dose is too high as my appetite becomes less suppressed towards the end of the week. It is really the first few days after my shot when the appetite is very depressed.

Also I seem to have no interest in eating during those days.

And I do prefer the taste of real food to the ""fake"" protein stuff and much prefer chicken breast.

 I had Thai food on Thursday and ordered extra chicken and had that for three days which was great as I had several meals of the chicken.

I am thinking of placing another order with real food and might also order some sashimi - not sushi since I don't want to waste my appetite on rice.

I used to love to cook but I really have no interest in prepping or cooking so rely on foods that are ready to eat. My supermarket sells poached salmon and I also like eating just plain smoked salmon ",2,1766345889.0,Zepbound,7,1.0,False

But now, I have much better self-esteem, yay! At the cost of my productivity. 

  
I'm currently REALLY struggling to do my work. It takes me hours to warm up, I feel, before I can even start. And if I'm lucky, I can start my work at noon, but most days I get started around 2 PM.

No one has said anything about my productivity yet, but I know the day will come soon as I will be tasked with more complex things. I'm currently at the beginning stages of my career and soon will be starting to do more difficult things.

My goal right now is to do 4-6 hours of productive work per day. But I just sit there in freeze mode for hours and it's really starting to affect me and my quality of life. I'm constantly disappointed in myself. I'm not even asking to be who I was, but I just want to do better. And am I the most passionate about my job? No. But I don't dislike the work.

I make sure I'm well rested, I try to eat a good protein breakfast every day, I drink coffee, and I take my meds. Currently, I'm on 450mg of generic Wellbutrin and 60mg of generic Sraterra. I have tried Vyannse, but that made everything worse and I was idling until 4 PM every day 😭

I really need help, but I don't see my psychiatrist until March 20th and I'm going to ask to try Ritalin. I also am trying to get a dyslexia assessment as I never had one as a child, though I'm pretty sure I am dyslexic so I'm not sure if that is crossing with ADHD and making everything worse.

Caffeine (The leading product in a lot of drinks, such as sodas, energy drinks, and coffees) Can make people with ADHD tired. Why? The caffeine interacts with the dopamine receptors differently in neurotypical people compared to neurodivergent people. When coffee (as a example of caffeine) meets dopamine receptors, sometimes it can overstimulate them, leading to a caffeine crash, or creating similar effects to those of melatonin or adenosine hormones which are known as sleep hormones, because when you overstimulate, it uses up a huge chunk of energy.

***Rhapsody I - The Hero Sets Forth***

***Once upon a time, not in the depths of Ithaca, but in the depths of the tax office. There, lived Menelaus the Digital, hero of queues and receipts.***

***One day he decided it was time to set out on a journey.***

***Not because fate called him,***  
***but because a notification arrived from Taxisnet:***

***“Your declaration from 2015 is still pending.”***

***So, he took his documents, the blue folder (the sacred one) and began his journey through 21st-century Greece, a land where heroes no longer fight Trojans, but platforms, PDFs, and QR codes.***

***Like every Odysseus, he had a wife: Fotini the Patient, who waited for him to pass through the Citizen Service Center, the Tax Office, and two ministries before returning home.***

***“Menelaus, beware of the Cyclopes!” she cried.***

***“Which Cyclopes?” he asked.***

***“The civil servants who see with only one eye, the official one!”***

 

***Rhapsody II -The Citizen Service Center of Wonders***

***And so Menelaus the Digital set out for the Citizen Service Center, the sacred lair of signatures and stamps.***

***A place where time flows differently: one minute outside, three hours inside.***

***Upon entering, he beheld the priests of the system  men and women armed with blue pens, plastic folders, and the sword-phrase:***

***“You need one more supporting document.”***

***“But I brought everything!” cried Menelaus.***  
***“ID copy, tax form E1, family certificate, even my grandmother’s social security number!”***

***The clerk looked at him calmly.***

***“Yes, but you’re missing form DD-42.”***

***“What is that?”***

***“We don’t know. But it’s required.”***

***Menelaus froze. He remembered Tiresias, who once told him:***

***“My child, never seek logic in the public sector. There, mystery reigns.”***

***Around him waited other souls:***  
***a grandfather certifying a photocopy from 1987,***  
***a grandmother asking if the CSC issues passports for dogs,***  
***and a young man declaring himself a “permanent resident of the internet.”***

***All awaited the divine voice of the screen:***

***“Number 247, counter 3!”***

***Menelaus’s number was 813.***

***He sat down and posted on Facebook:***

***“If I vanish, tell Fotini I was swallowed by the CSC. Send reinforcements and sesame rings.”***

***Hours later, his name was called.***

***The clerk stamped a paper with a divine THUD.***

***Deep inside lived the creature, the Cyclops of the Tax Office.***

***He had only one eye: the eye of his computer. He never looked at you.***

***“Name? Tax number?”***

***Menelaus answered.***

***The screen beeped.***

***“YOU OWE.”***

***“But I paid!”***

***“SYSTEM DOES NOT SEE PAYMENT.”***

***“But I have the receipt!”***

***“GO TO YOUR ACCOUNTANT.”***

***From afar a voice echoed:***

For profound ASD, extremely intellectual disability with an IQ *below 50* is part of the criteria. For a bit of insight, 70 and below is considered legally intellectually disabled. People with 70 and below IQs are seen as in need of support and assistance for life. Abbie is *at least* 20 points below that and may not even be able to be measured on an IQ test, since she'd actually have to sit and comprehend the test enough to do the pattern recognition questions. 

Asa never talks about this reality of his daughter's condition. Not only that, but he has his delusional fans--and himself and his wife, from what it seems--believing that she is going to be going out and working a job (even an ""autism-friendly"" job), for a while he had this vision of her riding her adaptive bike to a coffee shop and working as a barista, she's going to make t-shirts, she's going to have her own business, etc. He is constantly pushing this girl to learn ""independence"" to the point where he refuses to let her have any real fun anymore because ""everything MUST be an opportunity to learn a new skill for independence."" 

There IS no independence for someone with an IQ below 50. Abbie is not going to progress. This is where she is going to be at for the rest of her life. She CANNOT learn the things that they keep insisting on pushing her to learn; her brain literally CANNOT grasp these skills and these tasks and these concepts and nothing will ever be able to make it do so. Someone with an IQ below 50 cannot be a barista in a coffee shop. She cannot have her own business. She cannot learn to ride a bike (I remember they tried, she never did learn). Contrary to the humpers' delusions, she is CERTAINLY not ever going to be able to drive a car, go out partying on her 21st birthday, own a motorcycle (yes, there was someone saying they should buy Abbie a motorcycle), or cast a vote in an election. If the channel is truly meant to be informative, Asa should be informing his audience about what it means to have profound autism and profound intellectual disability, not pulling the wool over their eyes with all of these delusions of grandeur. 

The reality of Abbie's IQ also means that she is not INTENTIONALLY ruining moments like Priscilla's birthday ""because she's selfish and she wants it to be her own special day."" She is not manipulative. She is not spiteful. She does not flout social rules ""because she has no shame."" She has no mental capacity to be any of those things.

^(([ ~3.1k words | ~8min reading time ])^) 

So apparently, there's this epidemic in the shifting community where people have convinced themselves they need to spend every waking moment pretending they're in their DR. 

Spoiler alert: You don't.

And if you've been torturing yourself trying to convince yourself you're in your DR while clearly sitting in your CR bedroom surrounded by the same four walls you've stared at for years—congratulations, you've been gaslit. By yourself. Which is honestly impressive in the worst way possible.

**──────────────────────────────────**

**Disclaimer:** This post is basically here to explain why I personally think it doesn't make sense to ""live in the end"" as your DR-self and one should focus more on ""living in the end"" as a master shifter, and other LOA-related alternatives that could be used instead if someone wants to still stick to LOA as an approach. 

That being said—""living in the end"" is a great tool for manifestation, but in terms of shifting not necessary. LOA overall is just a tool. If you don't like LOA or this approach specifically, don't force yourself to use it just because it is a popular tool. There are PLENTY of alternatives aside from LOA. 

I've included sources, as usual, throughout the text and at the end again—but not only from Neville Goddard's specific books, but also web links so that people who don't own the books in any form can read the sources further.

**────────────────୨ৎ────────────────**

""Living in the end"" is a concept from Neville Goddard's teachings about manifestation and the Law of Assumption. 

Essentially, it means operating from the assumption that your desire is already fulfilled. You think, feel, and act as the person who already has what they want. The idea is that your imagination creates reality, so by consistently dwelling in the feeling of already having your desire, your 3D reality eventually conforms to match that internal state.  

>*""Live in the feeling of being the one you want to be and that you shall be.""* — Neville Goddard (1944) [Book: Feeling is the Secret] [^({ 1 })](https://coolwisdombooks.com/neville/neville-goddard-feeling-is-the-secret-the-art-of-realizing-your-desires-free-book/)

Great concept. Genuinely helpful for manifestation within your CR—like manifesting money, relationships, opportunities, whatever.

But the shifting community took this concept and bastardized it into the belief that you need to constantly pretend you're in your DR, deny your CR exists, and maintain this performance 24/7 or else shifting won't work. Basically they misunderstood it and turned into some kind of mental endurance challenge. 

That's not what Neville meant and it's definitely not a requirement for shifting. 

I've genuinely seen people say things like *""I pretend my CR friends are actually my DR friends""* or *""I imagine I'm walking through my DR school while I'm at my CR job.""*

Mate. You're at work. You're clearly at work. Your boss is right there. The fluorescent lights are flickering. The cheap coffee tastes like despair. You are demonstrably at work.

**🃜🃚🃖🃁🂭🂺**

**¦ The Cognitive Dissonance Olympics ¦**

What actually happens when you try to ""live in the end"" while being fully aware you're in your CR:

- Your brain: *""We're in our DR!""*

- Your literal eyeballs: *""We're in our CR.""*

- Your brain: *""No we're in our DR!""*

- Your bills: *""You're in our CR and you owe rent.""*

- Your brain: *""DR! DR! DR!""*

- Your alarm clock: *""It's 6 AM, get up.""*

This is cognitive dissonance. Your brain is trying to reconcile two completely contradictory pieces of information and doing this all day every day just stresses you out and makes you feel like you're losing your mind.

Because you kind of are.

If you're grieving, stressed, dealing with actual life circumstances that require your attention in your CR—forcing yourself to ""live as your DR self"" is avoidance, even though you should be healing. 

I've seen people in shifting communities talk about how they spend their entire day ""acting as if"" they're in their DR. They visualize their DR life while ignoring their actual life and refuse to engage with their CR because they're convinced acknowledging it will ""anchor"" them here.

Then they wonder why they're burning out, feeling disconnected, and still haven't shifted.

Every time you force yourself to deny your CR while being fully aware of it, you're creating cognitive dissonance. Your brain is trying to reconcile two conflicting pieces of information: ""I'm in my DR"" vs. ""I'm clearly not in my DR."" And when those two clash repeatedly throughout the day, you are rather just stressing yourself out instead of programming your subconscious. 

**🃜🃚🃖🃁🂭🂺**

**¦ The Assumption vs. Performance Distinction ¦**

>*""An assumption, though false, if persisted in, will harden into fact.""* — Neville Goddard (1968) [Lecture: Persistent Assumption] [^({ 2 })](https://coolwisdombooks.com/neville/persistent-assumption/)

An assumption is quiet and internal. It's just a baseline understanding you operate from. When you assume something, you're not forcing yourself to believe it every second of the day, since you just operate from that baseline sublty and without effort. 

For example: you assume the sun will rise tomorrow. You don't spend all day affirming *""The sun will rise. The sun will rise.""* You just know it will, so you plan your day accordingly.

That's the energy you want with shifting. Not *""I must convince myself I'm in my DR right now or I'll fail""* but rather *""I know I can shift and I will.""*

What most people are doing with ""living in the end"" is rather performance. The thing about performance is that it requires an audience. Which means part of you is always aware you're performing and will therefore never actually believe it.

**🃜🃚🃖🃁🂭🂺**

And then when people inevitably struggle with this approach, they get told to just... try harder at pretending.

- *""You're not believing hard enough!""*

- *""You need to really feel it!""*

- *""If you were truly living in the end, you wouldn't have doubts!""*

Right. Because the solution to unsustainable mental gymnastics is definitely more mental gymnastics. 

**؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ**
 
>**| The Alignment Angle |** ^((without the obsession)^) 

Now, if you're someone who uses alignment or LOA specifically as your shifting method, then yes—""living in the end"" makes more sense in that context. You're using it as a tool to align your energy with your DR. Even then you don't need to do it 24/7. 

Think of short visualization sessions, affirmations, or brief moments of immersion as ways to tap into your DR's energy. You don't try to maintain some constant state of delusion, since you are just periodically reminding yourself of where you're heading and letting that energy settle into your subconscious.

A 10min visualization session where you genuinely feel connected to your DR is way more effective than spending all day half-heartedly pretending you're there while your brain screams *""No we're not!""*

Quality over quantity.

You're tuning into the frequency of your DR for a moment, then letting that alignment do its work while you go about your actual life. You're not meant to hold that frequency manually like you're some kind of human radio tower.

Even energy work requires rest, so even alignment practices need breathing room. You tap in, you do the work, you let it integrate. That's the cycle.

**؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ**

>**| What your subconscious actually needs |**

Shifting doesn't require you to gaslight yourself into believing you're already in your DR, outside your specific method atleast. What it does require is believing that shifting is possible. That you're capable of it, so that your DR exists and is accessible to you.

You don't need to walk around all day pretending you're already there. You just need to trust that you can get there when you set the intention.

Your subconscious doesn't need you to put on an elaborate performance or live in denial 24/7. It needs direction, clarity, and perhaps actual belief. The belief that matters is this: *""Shifting is possible. I'm capable of it. My DR exists and I can access it, because I can shift at all times.""*

My main point is basically—you shouldn't be living in the end as your DR-self, but as a master shifter. As someone who can shift, not someone who is completely in a different reality while they are being here.  

Think about literally any other goal you've had in your life. When you wanted to learn an instrument, did you spend every waking moment pretending you already knew how to play? Did you sit at your desk at school imagining you were actually at a concert performing?

No. You just practiced. You trusted that with consistent effort, you'd get there eventually, because you believed in the possibility.

Shifting is the same thing. Believe in the possibility. Set your intention during your method, then go live your actual life without this constant mental strain.

**🃜🃚🃖🃁🂭🂺**

**¦ Intention-Setting ¦**

When you're doing your shifting method at night (or whatever time frame you chose), that's when you go all in. Immerse yourself in your DR, feel yourself there and exist mentally as your DR self. That's your focused intention time frame. 

Once you're done, you've set that intention and you're going about your day. You can just exist in your CR like a normal person.

That's another thing—let's say you did your method, Hypnagogia for example, and you didn't shift mid-method. You got kicked out or something else happened. So you can decide to try it again, since you can just immerse yourself again into that state, or you fall asleep, even if your mind wanders to your CR, or anything in that direction. 

No matter what you decide—keep the mindset of that you will wake up in your DR. You can still get distracted, fall asleep and then shift. Especially if you have set the intention before, so see falling asleep as a trigger for your subconscious to shift you. 

What I mean by that, program your subconscious into waking you up in your DR, despite not shifting mid-method. You are in control if it after all and the one doing the shifting, so program it to see you falling asleep as a direct transition to wake up in your DR. I have heard of many cases where people did their method, didn't shift, fell asleep with different thoughts, but still woke up in their DR, because the intention was already set. So they only need to trust that. If you set an intention, then trust that it will work. Afterwards you are allowed to do whatever. 

You set the intention after all, so the outcome is inventiable. That should be your mindset. 

Your subconscious got the message. It knows what you want. You don't need to keep reminding it every five seconds like it's a goldfish.

**؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ**

>**| The Multiple DR ""Problem"" |** ^((that isn't actually a problem)^) 

Oh, and this idea that having multiple DRs will ""confuse your subconscious""? Absolutely ridiculous.

Your subconscious can handle multiple realities. It's not a confused toddler that can't keep track of more than one concept at a time. Your subconscious is processing millions of pieces of information every single second. 

And you think it can't handle the concept of more than one DR?

Your subconscious is powerful enough to shift you between actual realities, to redirect your awareness across infinite possibilities, to navigate the fabric of existence itself—but somehow two or more DRs is too much for it to keep straight?

Make it make sense.

You can have five DRs. Ten DRs. Twenty DRs. Your subconscious will figure it out. The only time you need to give it clear direction is during your method, when you specify where you're going. The rest of the time it's fine. 

**؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ**

>**| The WR Phenomenon and people who balance out their CR + DR |**

Loads of people, including myself, shift to WRs. Basically little neutral spaces, blank rooms, random beaches—whatever. Most of the time not even the same exact WR. 

You know what's funny? Most people aren't emotionally invested in their WR(s) at all. They're not daydreaming about it constantly and not ""living in the end"" of being in their WR. They don't have a deep spiritual connection to a damn area they usually just use to relax and reflect a bit. 

They just set the intention to go there, did their method, and shifted.

If people can shift to places they barely think about, clearly this whole *""you must be constantly aligned and connected to your DR""* thing is nonsense.

Also, let's talk about people who shift regularly between multiple realities (mainly who balance out their CR and DR), so the one's who aren't planning to perma-shift, and who live in their CR during the day, do their thing, and then shift at night maybe once a week or once a month.

They're living fully in their CR during the day. They're engaged with their CR, so they're obviously acknowledging where they are, and then at night they shift, because they keep reminding themselves that they are able to shift while still being present in their current life, and that is enough. 

No issues or problems, so no ""but you have to deny your CR exists or you'll get stuck here"" drama.

Because your awareness can move between realities. You don't need to pretend one doesn't exist to access another.

**؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ**

>**| Neville Goddard |**

Let's revisit Neville for a second, since everyone loves quoting him without actually reading his work.

>*""You must make your future dream a present fact. You do this by assuming the feeling of your wish fulfilled.""* — Neville Goddard (1952) [Book: The Power of Awareness, Chap. 3] [^({ 3 })](https://www.thepowerofawareness.org/chapter-three)

The feeling, so the internal state, or better said the quiet knowing. He was talking about inner conviction. The kind of belief that sits quietly in your chest and you just know, basically the kind you don't have to force or maintain or perform.

He wrote extensively about imaginal acts—brief, focused visualizations done in a relaxed state before sleep. He didn't advocate for 24/7 mental gymnastics. He literally said to do your visualization, feel it real for a few minutes, then let it go and move on with your life.

The whole ""constantly think about it all day every day"" approach is the exact opposite of what he taught. 

**¦ SATS (State Akin To Sleep) ¦**

Neville's most recommended technique was SATS—imagining your desire fulfilled while in a drowsy state right before sleep. He describes this in his lecture *""Pruning Shears of Revision (1954)""* [^({ 4 })](https://coolwisdombooks.com/neville/pruning-shears-of-revision/): you get relaxed, enter that half-asleep state, then imagine a short scene that implies your wish is fulfilled.

Notice what he didn't say: maintain this visualization all day, deny your current reality exists, or perform constant mental gymnastics to ""prove"" you believe.

The feeling is what matters, as he emphasized in his book *""Feeling is the Secret (1944)""* [^({ 1 })](https://www.feelingisthesecret.org/): *""Feeling is the assent of the subconscious to the truth of that which is declared to be true. Because of this quality of the subconscious there is nothing impossible to man. Whatever the mind of man can conceive and feel as true, the subconscious can and must objectify.""*

So you're not trying to convince your conscious logical brain you're in your DR. You're impressing your subconscious through feeling—and that happens most effectively when you're relaxed, usually when your conscious mind is quiet, and not when you're stressed trying to maintain some exhausting mental state all day.

**¦ Revision ¦**

Neville taught revision as a way to rewrite unwanted experiences. In the same lecture on *""Pruning Shears of Revision (1954)""* [^({ 4 })](https://coolwisdombooks.com/neville/pruning-shears-of-revision/), he explains that before sleep, you replay any negative events from your day but change them to how you wish they had happened.

So you don't necessarily deny your CR, but you reprogram your subconscious so those negative impressions don't solidify. You acknowledge what happened, then consciously choose to impress a different version onto your subconscious before you sleep.

**¦ The Sabbath (Letting Go) ¦**

Neville was adamant about rest after you've done your imaginal work. In his book *""Freedom For All (1942, Chap. 5)""* [^({ 5 })](https://www.nevillegoddardfreedomforall.org/chapter-five), he writes about the importance of the Sabbath—the rest that follows creation.

You do your imaginal act, you feel it real, then you stop. You rest in the assumption it's done. You don't keep working at it. You don't obsess and you don't micromanage.

The obsessive ""think about it constantly"" approach completely contradicts this principle. Neville taught that once you've planted the seed (your imaginal act), you leave it alone and let it grow. Constantly digging it up to check if it's working is counterproductive.

**¦ Living in the End (The Real Version) ¦**

When Neville talked about ""living in the end,"" he meant operating from the assumption that your desire is fulfilled—and not performing a constant mental act. There's a massive difference.

In his book *""The Power of Awareness (1952, Chap. 4)""* [^({ 6 })](https://www.thepowerofawareness.org/chapter-four/), he explains: *""To reach a higher level of being, you must assume a higher concept of yourself.""* This is about internal shift in identity, in quiet knowing, so not about pretending all day while your brain fights you.

An assumption is effortless. It's just what you know to be true. Like knowing your name, or knowing gravity exists. You don't have to constantly remind yourself or perform to maintain it. It just is. 

**🃜🃚🃖🃁🂭🂺**

**¦ Practical Application ¦**

**1. SATS before sleep:** Get comfortable and relaxed. Imagine a brief scene from your DR—something simple that implies you're there. Feel it and let yourself drift into sleep from that state. Do this consistently, then trust it's working.

- [[SATS Guide for Shifting]](https://www.reddit.com/r/shiftingrealities/s/8OdVGNReIr)

**2. Revision when needed:** If something in your CR bothers you or reinforces limiting beliefs about shifting, revise it before sleep. Replay it differently. This clears mental blocks without requiring you to deny reality all day.

**3. Mental diet during the day:** When doubts come up, gently redirect them. You're not fighting them or forcing positivity. You're just choosing which thoughts you give energy to. This is manageable and sustainable, unlike constant mental performance.

- [[Guide Mental Diet ¦ Neville Subreddit]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/s/ntJ3MT0Svy)

- [[My Guide ¦ How to control your negative thoughts/ doubts]](https://www.reddit.com/r/realityshifting/s/G3a1o8XM1d)

**4. The Sabbath mindset:** After you've done your technique, let it go. Trust it's done. Stop checking for results every five minutes. The work happens in the rest, in the assumption, in the quiet knowing and not in the constant effort.

So brief focused immersion, feeling over logic + rest and trust. 

**؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ**

>**| You're allowed to have a life here |**

You're allowed to exist in your CR. You're allowed to acknowledge it. You're allowed to engage with your current life, deal with your responsibilities, experience your emotions, and exist as a human being in this reality.

Doing so doesn't make you ""too attached"" to your CR. It doesn't mean you don't want your DR enough and it doesn't ruin your chances of shifting. That's coming from someone who has always prioritized their CR, despite wanting to perma-shift and shifts. 

It just means you're a person who exists somewhere and acknowledges where they are. Wild concept, I know.

You can be dealing with grief, stress, or difficult circumstances and still shift. Your current situation doesn't determine your ability to redirect your awareness.

You just need to believe it's possible. Set your intention clearly during your method. Then trust the process and let your subconscious do what it does.

**؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ ؛ ଓ**

>**| The Actual Process |**

**During the day:** Live your life. Think about your DR when you want to. Script if you feel like it. Daydream. Get excited. Whatever feels natural. Just don't force yourself into some exhausting mental state.

**During your method:** Go all in. Visualize/feel/affirm/wtv tool you use in order to immerse yourself into your DR, then use clear intention. This is your focused time frame.

**After your method:** Let it go and trust it's happening. Sleep, or don't, but just stop micromanaging your subconscious.

Unlike the ""gaslight yourself 24/7 and hope for the best"" approach, which is just a recipe for burnout and confusion.

**────────────────୨ৎ────────────────**

**TL;DR:** ""Living in the end"" got twisted from a manifestation concept into an unsustainable mental endurance challenge. You don't need to pretend you're in your DR all day while clearly being in your CR. Live in the end as a master shifter who knows they're capable—don't gaslight yourself into believing you're already in your DR while clearly being in your CR. Your subconscious needs clear direction during your method, then trust and calm certainty throughout the day. You can have multiple DRs. You can acknowledge your CR exists. You can live an actual life here while still being capable of shifting. Stop the performance and trust the process. Your subconscious knows where you want to go.

⤷ Shifting is an act of expansion, not of rejection. You are adding to your existence, not denying it.

Until about six months ago, I had no complaints about our living arrangement. We split bills 50/50, share chores evenly, and overall he’s been a good partner to live with.

About six months ago, he started a new job that requires him to leave the house at 6 a.m. Around that time, I started noticing bread crumbs *everywhere* in the mornings. Not just in the kitchen by the toaster, but also by the kettle, on the windowsill, upstairs in my home office, on the coffee table, and even in the bathroom.

At first, I didn’t say anything, I assumed he was adjusting to a new routine and rushing in the mornings, so I just cleaned it up. After about a week I asked him if he could please use a plate when making toast—especially since he was taking it into multiple rooms. He apologized and it improved for a few days, but then the crumbs came back.

This pattern continued for about four months. I’d ask him to use a plate, he’d do it for a day or two, and then the house would be covered in crumbs again. Eventually I snapped and threw away his toaster while he was at work. This obviously caused a huge argument, but after that, the crumb issue completely stopped.

Over the past month, I’ve started noticing crumbs again in the mornings, which confused me because we no longer had a toaster. When I asked him about it, he suggested it might be the cats getting into food at night.

This morning while cleaning, I found a toaster hidden in a box under his side of the bed. I completely lost it and threw it away.

After that, I went to stay at my sister’s place. He must have come home from work because he’s been blowing up my phone, but I don’t want to talk to him right now.

So, am I the asshole for throwing away his toaster?

EDIT- he says he will clean the crumbs but doesn’t, or does but doesn’t do a good job so I still have to clean them up. It sounds stupid but I’m at my wits end with it. ",0,1766345305.0,AITAH,15,0.27,False

1psesbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1psesbn/i_recently_reconnected_with_my_exgirlfriend_of_5/,I recently reconnected with my ex-girlfriend of 5 years /ex-best friend of 8 years; she's married and hiding this from her husband.,"I (32yo male) have recently reconnected with my ex-girlfriend of 5 years (32yo female, let's call her M). M was my high school sweetheart, best friend since we were 15, and my first love. It's been 11 years since we broke up, I was an ambitious idiot that wanted to do things but didn't include her in my plans after college, that was my fault. I believe this led her to allow herself to get close to one of her male workmates, and she cheated on me with him. Things were messy, we eventually decided to end things then, that was 2014.

M and I have the same circle of friends in high school, and that group was pretty tight. We would occasionally see each other on small gatherings like, hanging out for coffee or random get-togethers. It has always been awkward, but I do my best to stay composed and interact properly. M and I both got relationships of our own eventually. We would then only see each other on important gatherings, like; year-end parties, birthdays, weddings, christening of our friends' kids. On less important gatherings, I would always ask if M was going, because I would say I couldn't come if she was going to be there. I had an overly jealous ex-girlfriend that I didn't want her to meet, my other ex-girlfriends were fine with it, but I ultimately realized that it was I that didn't want to be in the same space with her, and I wouldn't want to give any reason for my then current girlfriends to doubt me.

Fast-forward to June 2018, I was then single for 6 months, and to my knowledge, M had a serious relationship (not the workmate she cheated with). That said, I was surprised to receive a message from her on my birthday, she greeted me, I said thank you, and the conversation went on for a little bit, then she asked if I wanted to hang out. I asked what about her boyfriend, she said that they had broken up. So that's alright, I guess. We went for coffee, had a nice time, and I invited her over to my place to ""watch a movie or something"". We ""watched a movie or something"" a few more times in a span of 3 weeks. At the time, I was gauging her intentions, if she wanted to get back with me, or if she just needed company while they're on a break. I didn't want to make assumptions, so I just went with the flow until one day, she stopped messaging back. November of the same year, I messaged her on our supposed 10th Anniversary. I didn't get a reply, and I accepted that that was it and moved on.

The following year, I met someone new (currently 27yo female, Let's call her J), and we hit it off really well. I was in a relationship with J by February, and M was already out of my mind. A few months into that relationship, one of our mutual friends told me that M has gotten back with her boyfriend that she was on a break with. I didn't think anything of it, I was content and happy.

Fast-forward a year later, 2019. I'm fucked up. The relationship started really good, we had a lot of hobbies in common, we see each other every day, the s\*x was great, our families got along well. I had no complaints a year into our relationship. ""But all changed when the fire nation attacked!"" No, sorry - until COVID pandemic came, at that time, I was living in mom's house because she was alone when my sister went to college. J was visiting for the weekend when the lockdown announcement came, and she was stuck there with us for a few months. Our families were okay with it, so we didn't have a problem. My job considered me a frontliner, so I had to go out every day in face masks, face shields, sometimes full PPEs, it was a crazy time. That's when J started to show her anxiety. Separation anxiety whenever I leave for work, general anxiety about getting COVID, nothing I couldn't handle at first, she started seeing a therapist and taking anti-anxiety medications. That broke her, she was no longer Jolly, her s\*x drive was almost non-existent, and I tried my best to support her but the whole ordeal very much affected our relationship, not to mention any remaining social life I had, even when the pandemic was over. By September 2024, with the best of our abilities to make it work, we had to end it as neither of us were happy anymore.

Fast-forward to this year, 2025. I was diagnosed with depression in February, and I took anti-depression pills for a while, but I didn't like the effect on me, so I stopped seeing my therapist and stopped taking the meds. Instead, I went on solo trips, reconnected with my high school friends, started to go out more, and I feel a lot better for the most part. A few months ago, my sister told me that she saw a post on Facebook that M got married (with the guy she was on a break with when we ""saw some movies or something"", from this point on, let's call him N). Initially, I was upset that I wasn't invited because I wanted free cake and hang out with my friends, seeing all of them together in some pictures, but I realized it was probably a good decision not to invite me.

Around September, one of our closest friends from high school was going to migrate to Canada and wanted to get together in a pool resort before she left. That was the 3rd time that me and M saw each other since 2018. The 1st time was on a wedding, and the 2nd time was on a house-blessing, both of which, I was with J and M was with N. At the pool resort, M was not with N, he was in Brazil for work. It was a fun time, I was surrounded with awesome friends, had good food, in a nice venue. M and I never had a moment with just the two of us, but we hung out in the pool with our friends, played cards until morning, a very wholesome send-off party for our friend. I went home, and I couldn't stop thinking about M. I know she's married, so I slapped myself back to reality and went on with my life.

Note: I don't know much about N, just that he's an alright dude if M married him. I have heard no complaints about him from our friends.

A month later, a smaller portion of the same group invited me at a friend's place, some drinking, videoke, and just hanging out. I was free so I confirmed. I knew M was coming and N is still in Brazil, but I didn't think any of it. It turned out to be just me, M, the host (Let's call him R), and a couple with their toddler. It was classic Filipino fun, 20+ songs queued in the videoke machine, some light drinking, plenty of food. R has a kid too, so the couple's kid had someone to play with while we enjoyed. A few hours into it, I went out to the balcony to vape. Some minutes later, M went out to the balcony for some air. We smiled, exchanged a short friendly conversation, and I was about to go back in, one hand on the door handle, she called out, and asked me how I was doing. I let go of the handle, and in turned into about 30 minutes of catching up with our personal lives. We were getting deeper, and my heart started pumping really loud, I had to cut our conversation, and I went inside. I might have come off a bit rude, but the night went on normally, and we went home. There I was again, alone in my room and couldn't take my mind off M. I know she's married, so I slapped myself back to reality and went on with my life.

\-I got news that N was back, and our friends were inviting everyone in the group chat for a get-together. I didn't feel like going, I was a bit withdrawn and was having a few episodes of breakdowns, not because of M. Just that I was not happy with where I was in life. I went for another trip, visited some relatives in the province, took a short vacation tour, felt a bit better, I went home. At this point, I'm staying at my tiny cabin right beside my mom's house, not sure if it's relevant but solitude probably contributed to my loneliness.

Yesterday, it was one of those days again. Opened my PC, started at the desktop for hours, I don't feel like playing, I don't feel like watching a movie or listening to music, I don't feel like doomscrolling, I don't feel like going out, honestly, I don't feel like talking to anyone either. I opened a notepad app, and I start typing my thoughts, it was melancholic but, I had to have an outlet, I decided to post it on my Facebook status but visibility only to me. I felt better and I was able to open a game. 2 hours into playing, I receive a message request from M. This was the first time I have received a message from her directly since 2018, I am using a different account since then, so I had to approve her request. It was just Hello -wave emoji-, I replied with Hello - wave emoji-. She asked if I wanted to hang out in a coastal road with one other friend, R. I was feeling alright, and I thought maybe going out would do me some good, so I said sure. I wasn't sure if N was going too, I didn't ask. I was supposed to back-ride with R in his motorcycle. On the time we were supposed to meet up, the rain poured so hard, we couldn't go on the motorcycle anymore, so M had to pick us up with her car. N wasn't with her; he's back in Brazil. We drove through the rain to the coastal road, when we got there, the rain's gone and the weather was nice. The three of us got to eat some street food, caught up with each other, there was even a small fireworks display when it got dark, it was a pleasant time. We stopped by a coffee shop on our way back, stayed there for a few hours and the three of us hung out some more, all friendly and wholesome.

About 10pm, we called it a night, M had to drive us to R's place to get his motorcycle, so R could ride along back to M's place, then take me back to my place. I hope you're following, might have been better if I used fake names instead of initials. Anyway, when got to R's place, and that bastard took his sweet time, so it was just me and M in her car while we wait. That was yet again, the only moment that we were together in a space, just the two of us. I feel my heart about to burst from my chest, but I played it cool, started a conversation about her work, we talked about our families, we were once very close with each other's. We talked about a few wholesome memories we had in high school, and some recent events happening with our friends. I just noticed, my heart was calm. I realized I was talking to my best friend, not my ex-girlfriend. The flow was just natural, felt like we could talk about anything forever. R shows up after about 20 minutes, not sure if intentional. He insisted I ride with M back to her place, so I did. We talked for about 10 more minutes, continuing our earlier conversation while she drove. We got to her place; I said goodbye and left the car to ride on R's motorcycle. He took me back to my place, he said it was intentional, that he wanted us to have some time to talk. Bastard. He went on his way, and I was in my cabin again, alone. I checked my phone, and I got a message from M, said that she was home (had to drive inside the village, we couldn't drive her all the way in). I replied that I got home safe too and told her I had a nice time and said good night. I couldn't get M out of my head. I know she's married, so I slapped myself back to reality and went on with my night. Played a game until I was too exhausted to think and fell asleep.

Last part. Yay, you made it! Sorry if it's been a long post. I tried to make it detailed but concise, but hopefully not boring.

Today, I receive a message from M, she said she appreciated my time yesterday and really meant a lot for her that we could catch up, then proceeded to remind me that we'll see each other again on the 23rd for our year-end party with our friends. I was touched to know so I replied that it meant a lot for me too, that it felt like I was talking to my best friend again. That led to a full-on conversation throughout the whole day. We got to talk about what happened in 2018. Apparently, she said that they weren't just on a break. She left N to be with me. My heart sunk to know this information. I told her that I thought she wanted my company BECAUSE she was on a break with N, and that I was going with the flow until it was clear. I even joked that I felt that she just used my body, and she said that she felt that I used her. We went on until evening, she asked if we could actually be friends, my answer is not if she's not telling her husband that she's talking to me, but I didn't tell her that, I said I didn't know. She then asked if I wanted to be friends with her. I said yes, until my heart stops pumping, I want to be her friend. I returned the questions, she said she wants to be friends, but it's not going to be that simple. Our conversation continued to almost midnight, and we went deep. We're not doing anything wrong, but it doesn't feel right, especially that her husband doesn't know.

I don't know if it's right to keep this going. I wish I could get my best friend back without falling back in love, that simply knowing that she's married is enough to keep our friendship going until we grow old. We're going to see each other in 2 days, but we'll never get rid of each other completely. So here I am again, in my cabin. Alone. Writing. M...",1,1766345253.0,TrueOffMyChest,8,0.6,False

Did some swimming for a while until I had to go inside like a submarine because I almost hit another person haha. finally I'm gonna wrap my day up with a good movie I'm gonna watch!

Imagine this usual scenario......you ever see posts/reels in Instagram/TikTok and wonder when do I get someone who's sweet, caring, possibly confident(definitely haha) and a guy who will be honest if the situation comes up?

just like I have told you in the post, I'm a big fan of life, I love adventures, spontaneous trips or just cuddling in the bed while watching Netflix, I'm mature enough to give you your personal space and support you at times where you need me the most and immature enough to do fight water gun battles with you lol(I will win haha).

I have lot planned in life, financial wise, I pretty much figured out my life and intellectually I feel like I'm smart enough to overcome situations, whereas both of them are good for me, I also want some unpredictability, some fun and someone whom I can call whenever I want, play any kind of game I want(planning to buy PS5, a laptop guy now) and honestly....wake up but still pretend to fall asleep for a few mins so that I can snuggle with you.

I like to watch sports, anime and Hollywood moves and K-dramas so that I can practice my rizz on you hehe(so dumb!)

**Some of my hobbies:** I play badminton, piano, music, games, I love tinkering with projects and stuff, currently working as a citizen scientist part time, I love to explore new places/long drives, vacations. I like hiking and When I am tired I mostly do Netflix and chill. Cook something new or just learn something new. I like brainy stuff such as stargazing and physical ones such as paragliding, surfing and many more!

I don't really mind the ages or anything like that and if in the off chance that I do get lucky, maybe we can start from LDR and end at ""I do""? hahaha

The track has a long and a short layout. The whole track is lighted for night races. The light can be turned off separately, depending on which layout the race is taking place in.  
In the Welcome Center you can find a coffee shop, a fan store for every race fan, and multiple conference rooms. It is also the main station of the subway.  
Behind the pit building is the paddock. It offers much room for the race teams to park their trucks loaded with the racecars.  
Each grandstand is lighted and has its own subway station.

To get to the paddock i've built a large tunnel which leads from the city directly to the paddock (Pic. 12)  
Maybe someday I will add more stuff, like small stands for the visitors to buy drinks and so on, but for now I'm very happy with my build... It has cost me a lot of time and lots of nerves to build it, but for now I can look at it and be proud of myself that I have made it.

Die Strecke hat eine kurze und eine lange Version. Dazu kommt das die gesamte Strecke für Nachtrennen beleuchtet ist. Die Beleuchtung lässt sich separat für das kurze oder das lange Layout umschalten.

Im Welcome Center findet man Kaffees, einen Fan Store für Merchandising und mehrere Konferenzräume. Dazu befindet sich darin auch der Hauptbahnhof der Strecken-U-Bahn.

Hinter dem Boxengebäude befindet sich das Fahrerlager, in dem die Teams genügend Fläche für die LKWs beladen mit den Rennautos zum parken ist.

Jede Tribüne ist beleuchtet und hat seine eigene U-Bahn Station.

Um zum Fahrerlager zu gelangen habe ich einen  großen Tunnel gebaut, welcher direkt von der Stadt zum Fahrerlager führt. (Foto 12)

Vielleicht werde ich in Zukunft noch weitere Kleinigkeiten hinzufügen wie Getränkestände für die Gäste oder so, aber für den Moment bin ich zufrieden mit der Strecke so wie sie ist.

The actual fast will be based on Daniel Chapter Ten (Not Chapter One Version) it will be No Alcohol, No Meat, No Bread, No Cookies, Candy and Cake. We are also adding no coffee as coffee does more damage  to every organ and bodily system than alcohol does. 

I will be using a Plant Based Multivitamin like Natures Way Alive Multivitamin, Magnesium Glycinate, Iron and Vitamin C to make sure I get all my nutrients.

Protein is super important but protein doesn't mean meat. On the Fast, I will be eating Brown Rice and Kidney Beans together; Eggs as well drinking Garden Of Life Raw Organic Protein (sourced from 15 plant protein sources, no soy, no stevia, no erythritol): https://a.co/d/8TQGaVS

Most people need about 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight at minimum (about 50grams) to avoid diseases that come from protein deficiency.  Depending on their health situation some may need 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight (100grams) or more. However the people who live the longest and have the lowest amount of disease live in Blue Zones eat only 10% of their calories as Animal Flesh. That means the rest of their protein comes from specific plants that are high in protein.

My favorite Daniel Fast foods are in this video: https://youtu.be/CGxeDo59zOA?si=mReqvltmLbS4_w4s

Most people in the United States get tons of protein and meat but a doctor told me that I do not get enough protein. Before the Fast begins I will be eating Salmon and Tuna to try to get my Omega3 Essential Fatty Acids and Iron levels up.

**Score Bet**: **+110**

Wager Amount: 8U to WIN 8.8U

League: New England Patriots vs Baltimore Ravens (7:15PM CST on NBC/PeacockTV)

**Recap**: Got hooked on Commanders +10.5 leg! Loss by a half point! That's how parlays goes and that's how my parlays usually goes lmfao. I honestly wish this SGP loss by a million miles than be this razor close! Eagles went for 2-Pt conversion for really no reason. If they gone for XP or didn't covert we would have covered (obviously needing the final drive score from the Commanders). But I don't blame them because Fake Elidiot sucked yesterday and essentially missed 3 FGs. I didn't have much hope after Mariota got injured early in the 2nd half, but they made this SGP close from hitting and I really wish they didn't.

**Matchup:** I'm nuking the Patriots +3 today and sprinkling them to win outright. I understand the narratives and understand what's at stakes for the Ravens, they desperately need this win to stay alive in the postseason hunt, but I'm going the other direction on this one. I don't expect the Pats to let off the gas, Vrabel and his Pats competed from bell to bell against the Bills. Yes, they botched a 21-0 lead, but I like everything about this Patriots team under Mike Vrabel. This Pats team is the highest scoring offensive team in the league and Drake Maye is making a surprising appearance in the MVP market. Ravens loss too many games and Lamar Jackson just does not look like the MVP form as we are use to seeing. I'm not going too much indepth wit this analysis since this is a very late writeup and want to enjoy these NFL games currently going on. So if you really want to tail this I would do your own due diligence.

**The Play & Prediction :** 8.8U on Pats +3. Patriots win a shootout, 33-29

2) why does Ilya ""order"" a black coffee for Carter? What's the joke here
3) what is Ilya mouthing when leaving the hospital room?

Great episode but these 3 moments left me baffled. Can someone explain please 😄

EDIT TO INCLUDE THE ANSWERS - thanks, hivemind!

1) apparently this is super common Canadian hockey slang, kind like saying ""you're a beaut"", meaning a great person on and off the ice (Merleau seems to assume Ilya had had a wild night and yet still shows up looking all fresh so it looks like he's playing hard & working hard and Marleau is impressed, hence the comment)
2) this is to poke fun at Carter being drunk, since coffee is meant to sober people up (honestly I thought that was just Carter being Carter, he's often a bit hyper so getting him CAFFEINE seemed like a weird idea to me lol but now I get it!)
3) Ilya is just going ""shhh"" to Shane who's off his tits on meds and being goofy and not at all careful (and adorable).

Thanks all! Love this fandom!

I’m not the kind of person who spends 20 minutes in salutation to the coffee gods as part of my espresso routine—I weigh my beans, give them a few sprays of water, grind them, WDT, tamp, pull, and then foam my milk (today was 50/50 barista blend oat milk and Trader Joe’s eggnog. It was perfect. Definitely not a purist over here).

My girlfriend just got a Breville Barista Express, and I’m really surprised to find myself enjoying a lot of its features. When I began my espresso journey two years ago I saw that machines like this were overlooked for their built-in hoppers and less customizable accessories due to their integrated nature. 

Things I like about the barista express:

* The integrated hopper is super convenient and probably keeps beans fresher than how I do it
* The grind dose has been really consistently 18 grams
* Not using a WDT hasn’t ruined my life yet
* The venting of the steam/grouphead pressure is really nice 
* The included portafilter feels heavy duty and nice
* It’s only $500
* Seeing the pressure is nice, even though it seems like it always reports a pressure right in the middle of the gauge

Things I don’t like:

* Custom accessories aren’t really supported, you’re locked into the stuff that comes with afaik
* It would be nice to try an automatic steam wand some day to see how I like it
* A way to clear the grinder from fines would be nice but honestly this is probably just an enthusiast take—does it *really* matter?
* Too many unused buttons and LEDs (I’ll never change the filter size, I’ll never use Program or Single Cup buttons)

I’ve been thinking about bringing my current espresso setup to the office and getting a nicer setup at home. Is there any space as a wannabe espresso enthusiast for devices like this? Are there other machines that I should look at?

**AITA for making my SIL feel bad about saying I should “straighten my hair.”**

**Originally posted to r/AmItheAsshole**

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Racism!<

**MOOD SPOILER:** >!Positive!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/tjDmqKIQ3X)  **June 12, 2020**

So, I’m a mixed race woman, but I’m very black looking. With that, my hair, while not as kinky as it could be, is very curly. I usually straighten it, but every so often I just let the curls fly. I married into a white family, but it’s NEVER been an issue. I think I’m closer to my in laws than I am to most of my own dysfunctional family.

We had a family dinner this week, since some of the restrictions have eased. While having dinner, my MIL and I were discussing some of the hurtful comments I’ve been hearing these last few weeks. Specifically, a lot of people have been shouting slurs at me in my small city, and someone threw a half empty can of soda at me.

My SIL, (husband’s brother’s wife) who up until this point has been very sweet to me, said “well, that’s sad. Maybe if you straighten your hair, you’ll look less ‘ethnic’ and people will leave you alone.”

I just gaped at her for a moment, and then said, “well, my hair had been ‘straight’ everytime, and even if it wasn’t, I DONT see why that makes it okay for someone to call me a ‘black cunt’ in the parking lot.”

The table went quiet and got awkward. My in-laws were all on my side, but my BIL messaged me to tell me her intentions were good, and that I humiliated her in front of the family. So reddit, AITA? 

For reference, SIL (who I really do like!) is newer to the family. I’ve been with my husband for 11 years, and they’ve been married for one. I don’t want her to feel left out or judged. I don’t think she meant to hurt my feelings, but she did. I feel especially bad, because my other in laws who have known me defended me, but I don’t think she actually meant to be cruel. Just ignorant. She’s from a very small (white) town, and hasn’t met many POC.

Edit: I officially understand what it means to have your inbox blow up, now. I wanted to clarify a few things and give a brief update.

I felt like an AH because of the environment we were in at the time (I was thinking maybe I could have approached the topic with her later, but I didnt). I also didn’t “snap” or “yell” at her, like some of the comments say—I stated my comment with a slight laugh because it was already so awkward.

My SIL is not racist, like some have implied. I truly believe that. I think she’s ignorant on this because she’s never had to think about things like this. Does that make it okay? No, but it doesn’t mean she’s “disgusting.” 

I’m taking the overwhelming NTA as a sign that I didn’t need to wait for a “safe space” to make my comment. I’ve also already texted her this morning about meeting up today, and she responded very enthusiastically. 

I think this is an opportunity for growth, so I’m gonna take it. I also think that if we all hold the view “we shouldn’t have to be the ones to teach them” so close, we may lose out on some really good chances to build bridges instead of walls. I don’t have to be the sole source of her black education, but I can definitely be a cliff note.

**VERDICT: NOT THE ASSHOLE**

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**indecisive_maybe**

> NTA. You were right to be shocked. It's also great that you understand her background so you're not mad at her. But I'd say she is TA if she had your BIL text you about it - focusing on a little goof instead of focusing on you and the much tougher public yelling and name-calling  you've been through. 
>
> I'd vote that you reach out an olive branch to her. What she said is not okay, but her heart is in the right place and she's willing to learn. Maybe you can ask your BIL to share some resources with her to get more educated.

**OOP**

>>I did message him and tell him that I never wanted her to feel humiliated, but the suggestion was pretty silly and ignorant. I do think she is a wonderful person, but she doesn’t have a ton of experience with POC, so I hope it’s just the comments of a silly young person.

**~**

**downvoted commenter**

>NAH I think she had good intentions in her own ignorant way. It sounds like you reacted with anger, which during these times is understandable, but still not ok.  You missed an opportunity to teach her (which I imagine is exhausting right now) and instead shut down any communication.

**OOP**

>> Oh, I understand. I wasn’t aggressive or “angry” in my response (I tend to lean towards humor to ease tension). I said with a chuckle “well, yes, but...” 
>>
>> I was hoping to make it less serious, but that didn’t change how the people around me interpreted it :/ bad timing. I never wanted her to feel like I just shut her down, which is why I tried to make it more silly than anything else.
>>
>> I do really like her. I think it’s just a lack of life experience.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/4WggLvncuv)  **June 29, 2020 (17 days later)**


(I originally wrote this post the day after my initial post! That’s why the timeline is the way it is)

So, my SIL and I met this morning for coffee. Coffee turned into lunch turned into pre-dinner drinks. We literally have been together all day.

She mentioned she has been trying to figure out how to reach out to me for a few days, but I did it for her. She apologized, and assured me that she WAS humiliated, but not because of me (directly) but because as soon as I made my response, she realized how stupid her comment was. She was also texting BIL, because she had no idea he reached out to me, and was mortified. She offered to let me read the texts, but I declined. That’s between them.

We talked about my hair, and my life story, and micro aggressions. We also discussed the BLM movement, and I find that we have more in common than I ever could have hoped. She cried. I cried. It was a very open moment, and her words, “I really never understood,” tell me everything I need to know...although there are probably some very concerned baristas wondering wtf was happening.

I did tell her it would be a very beneficial thing to look into some literature, because her future nieces/nephews will deal with similar issues, and she downloaded some books while sitting with me at the table. She told me she just wants to know what to do because she is just clueless. I think that’s fair. If you’ve never had to put out a fire, you may panic when your stove is suddenly engulfed in flames. 

I hadnt heard from BIL yet, but we literally just left each other a little bit ago, and she’s got some words for him. 

Really, I’m actually very happy this happened. We had a great chance to get to know each other even better. (We even discussed theology, as she is very Christian and I am an atheist/former avid church goer) and even that conversation was very positive, rather than accusatory or uncomfortable. 

We’re meeting again next week...I may have just inadvertently started a bit of a book club ;) I ensured her she is more than welcome to reach out to me at anytime. I’d rather she have someone she cares about that also cares about her help her in her development, rather than make a blunder in front of someone potentially less forgiving. She wants me to call her on her “dumb statements.” I’m happy to do so.

Again, I stand by what I said. She’s a wonderful person suffering from some ignorance. But she’s open to learn, and I couldn’t ask for more.

(Since the first type written update): we’ve had lunch and/or dinner three times since. It’s been very fun, and such a relief to spend time together. My BIL has since texted me as well, and we had lunch too, as a group, and he’s already apologized. He was trying to defend his wife, but didn’t stop to think about the circumstances. We’re ALL good now. It’s been very fun to have an excuse to spend more time together! 

Thanks for everyone that reached out. I’m glad I took initiative!

Edit: some people have asked which books I’ve suggested, and I wanted to let you know which ones she downloaded in the spot.

First, since she works with young adults, I suggested “The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas. She ordered a few copies and wants to put it in her classroom for next year.

Second: “White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism” by Robin DeAngelo. I hadn’t read this myself, but we read the description together.

Third: “Hair Love” the children’s book.

I’ve given her some good places to look for more resources. But she’s working through those three first. She actually started with “hair love” and we had a really good chat about it. Incidentally, after we talked about it, we got drinks, and I was carded. (My DL has straight hair, and she commented on it) The woman carding me complimented my natural hair, saying I should update my id with my natural hair! She loved my curls! Funny how that works out.


Second edit: I’d love additional book recommendations! As a black woman, I’ve never had to really read a book about understanding the “black perspective.” I mean; I live it everyday. So any additional books that can offer insight are very helpful.

Third edit: I’ve received many messages both here and in the DMs about the white fragility book. I think they’re all very fair, and so I’m opening up: please do not hesitate to give me other, better books to recommend! I’ve been reading a few myself, but I want to be sure I’m giving her GOOD content!

Like every year, I added one untested recipe to my usual favourites. This year, it was a highly economical version of *Sirupbusserl* from the 1947 edition of the Bayerisches Kochbuch.

***860. Sirupbusserl, II Type***

***125g syrup, 100g sugar, 25g fat, 2 tbsp water, 300g flour, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp cardamom, 1 heaping teaspoon potash, 2 tbsp hot water***

***Boil syrup, sugar, and fat, then let cool. Mix fat with flavour-bearing ingredients, add syrup mixture and dissolved potash. Knead dough thoroughly, shape small balls, brush with thick syrup water and bake on a greased sheet at a medium heat. Brush with syrup water again shortly before removing from the oven.***

*Sirupbusserl*, literally syrup kisses, are a common South German Christmas confection. We find recipes in cookbooks earlier than this, and they are usually a good deal richer. This one, like many other “II. Type” recipes added to the 1947 edition of the [Bayerisches Kochbuch](https://www.bayerisches-kochbuch.de/), takes account of the bleak situation of postwar Germany. I tried it out of interest and found the result not bad. They remind me of pine tree shillings, a New England cookie.

I heated the syrup, butter, and sugar in a saucepan on a gentle heat, then brought the liquid to a quick boil and removed it from the stove. Once it had cooled to lukewarm, I added it to the flour, sifted with the spices, and the potash dissolved on 2 tbsp of water. The resulting dough was heavy and lumpy until I kneaded it by hand, but eventually turned out smooth and pliable. Given my old oven’s erratic approach to temperature, I began at a low moderate heat of 175°C and removed the first batch after seven minutes. Though they were crisp and brown on the outside, that turned out to be too early. After I found them doughy, I extended the baking time for the second batch to twelve minutes and returned the first to the cooling oven afterwards to dry through. They are now quite hard, but are liable to soften over the coming days.

Compared to my regular Christmas recipes, these make a poor showing. Sweet, crisp, and spicy, they are all right, but they lack depth, richness and warmth. I will not be adding them to my regular repertoire. But of course, I did not expect them to come up to that standard. They are of their time, a luxury in the postwar years when millions froze and starved across Europe, but still ration book cookery stretching the meagre allocations of fat and sugar as far as it would go.

For comparison, and to illustrate what an entire generation of Germans meant when they said *Vorkriegsqualität* (pre-war quality), this is the recipe “I. Type”:

***859. Sirupbusserl, I. Type***

***400g syrup, 200-250g sugar, 2 eggs, cinnamon, cloves, candied orange peel and citron, finely cut, as desired, 3 tbsp coffee or water, 3/4 to 1 kg of flour, 15g baking soda, syrup water to brush.***

***Beat the syrup with sugar, eggs, and liquid until foamy, add spices, stir in flour and baking soda, and work thoroughly. Shape small balls, brush with syrup water, bake at medium heat on a well-greased sheet, and brush again with syrup water while still hot. Alternatively, roll out dough not too thin, cut out cookies, and bake at medium heat on greased sheet. Brush with syrup water while still hot.***

I’m a thoughtful, caring, outdoors-loving, video game-loving, tech professional in the Seattle/PNW area who values kindness, laughter, respect, animals, art, and meaningful connection, leans left politically while valuing open discussion, am seeking a local ish (or relocating) partner for a long-term, potentially lifelong relationship built on friendship, humor, shared adventures, aligned values, and mutual care, with openness to exchanging photos early on and growing together over time. 

The Long Version:

I’m someone who believes the best relationships are built on laughter, kindness, and genuine connection. Friends would describe me as thoughtful, caring, and the kind of person who remembers the little things. I love the outdoors, whether it’s a peaceful hike, a day at the park, or just watching the sunset.

When I’m not outside, you might find me exploring my love for computers and video games, visiting a museum, or appreciating art in all its forms. Animals hold a special place in my heart, and I’m happiest when I’m sharing life with a fellow good-spirited soul. I firmly believe people should be treated with respect at all times, but I am more than capable of standing up to others when there is a need, which there rarely is. There is no room in this life for hate of others, and far too many people seem to make hate their whole personality. 

A Few Things You Should Know About Me:

I am left leaning and identify most closely with the Democratic Party on most things, but I approach every issue on its own merits, so there are some issues where I take the GOP stance on, I am more than happy to answer questions you may have. 

You do not have to be a democrat by any means, but please be prepared to briefly discus politics when you reach out, to ensure our ideals align. 

I currently live in Washington state, specifically the Seattle area, so I am mainly looking for those in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), as that will make it easier for us to visit each other with some regularity, the PNW is comprised of WA, OR, northern CA, parts of ID, and part of British Columbia. If you are however outside of this area, please only reach out to me if you are able to commit to moving WA state in the near future, as I don’t expect to be in a position to leave the State anytime soon. 

I currently work in tech providing support for a software company, but I am trying to jump careers, I am happy to answer more questions about this via DM.

Please be ready to share pics with me in the first 3 days of chatting if we hit it off, and I will do the same, although I have no issues exchanging pics on day 1 either. 

What I’m Looking For:

I’m hoping to meet someone loving, funny, and full of life, someone who’s up for adventures big and small, from deep conversations over coffee to spontaneous weekend getaways. A good heart and a great sense of humor are important for me.

I want a partner who is a true friend that I can love and care for, who can also love and care for me. 

If you’re looking for a partner who will listen, laugh, and grow with you, and you are onboard with everything in my post so far, I’d love to hear from you.",1,1766344338.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I hate to say this but there has become a pattern.

In the talking stages, everything can be going good.

The minute I say no or clearly communicate a boundary

Doesn't even have to be a big deal, just saying no to literally anything can get me ghosted

Such as if they ask for a drink and I say how about coffee instead

The last person was doing lots of love bombing saying how much they want to be with me, and don't want me to talk to anyone else , swearing they will never ghost me

But I was staying rational , a bit neutral from it since I prefer actions over words and I've been hurt so many times before but I wanted to stay open minded and hopeful

This person for the 3rd time left me on read for over 24 hours after texting fast like crazy other times saying how much they want to be with me , like me, promising morning and good night texts

It kinda felt like since it's the weekend maybe they went out on a date each day/night and just chose to ignore me

It's long distance so how can I possibly know 

All the while they keep insisting how they don't want me to talk to anyone else

So I got irritated by this and just said I appreciate consistency and if someone wants to be the only person in my life then they need to satisfy my need for communication

So I know I'm being ghosted but I still keep checking and my mind keeps wondering if they will reply

1pseciy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pasadena/comments/1pseciy/sharing_a_sudden_health_change_and_asking_for_help/,Sharing a sudden health change and asking for help,"Hi Pasadena. I wanted to share something personal that’s happened very suddenly over the last few weeks, and ask for a little guidance from this community.

A short time ago, I choked on a sip of water and was hospitalized with aspiration pneumonia. Because I have vocal cord paralysis, swallowing has always been risky, but this time it led to an 11 day hospital stay.

During testing in the hospital, it was determined that my swallowing muscles are no longer functioning safely. Because of that, I had to have a permanent feeding tube placed, with orders to consume nothing by mouth for life. It has been a sudden and emotional shift, and it has completely changed what daily life looks like.

I am still trying to process that I can’t simply walk to Green or Colorado for coffee or dinner or dessert with my wife. The feeding tube is what keeps me nourished and hydrated, but it also means needing help throughout the day with feeds, hydration, managing supplies, transportation to appointments, and keeping up with basic household needs.

I am blind, but I’ve always been independent and active in the community. This new medical reality has created challenges I never anticipated. On top of that, the medical costs added up quickly, and my wife may have to take unpaid time off work to help care for me and get us through the immediate aftermath of the hospitalization.

We recently learned that in-home support (IHSS)through the state would only be available if we paid nearly $3,900 per month out of pocket due to Medi-Cal share of cost. That was surprising and simply not sustainable alongside everything else.

Friends helped us out by setting up a GoFundMe to cover medical expenses and help us get through this transition. We’re incredibly grateful for the support so far. At the same time, we’re trying to learn if there are any home care services, nonprofit organizations, or community programs that help with in-home support or transportation at a more manageable cost. With how fast everything happened, it’s hard to know what options might exist that we haven’t found yet.

Before all of this, a big part of my life in Pasadena has been working with blind baseball, through my nonprofit SoCal Beep Baseball Association. Helping visually impaired kids and adults find confidence, independence, and community through the sport has meant everything to me. My hope is still to get back to a place where I can continue that work and give back.

If anyone has resources, ideas, or leads to share, I would truly appreciate it. And if resources aren’t something you have, financial support or sharing our story is also deeply appreciated. Even taking the time to read this means more than I can say.

Thank you so much.",9,1766344155.0,pasadena,4,1.0,False

I’m a thoughtful, caring, outdoors-loving, video game-loving, tech professional in the Seattle/PNW area who values kindness, laughter, respect, animals, art, and meaningful connection, leans left politically while valuing open discussion, am seeking a local ish (or relocating) partner for a long-term, potentially lifelong relationship built on friendship, humor, shared adventures, aligned values, and mutual care, with openness to exchanging photos early on and growing together over time. 

The Long Version:

I’m someone who believes the best relationships are built on laughter, kindness, and genuine connection. Friends would describe me as thoughtful, caring, and the kind of person who remembers the little things. I love the outdoors, whether it’s a peaceful hike, a day at the park, or just watching the sunset.

When I’m not outside, you might find me exploring my love for computers and video games, visiting a museum, or appreciating art in all its forms. Animals hold a special place in my heart, and I’m happiest when I’m sharing life with a fellow good-spirited soul. I firmly believe people should be treated with respect at all times, but I am more than capable of standing up to others when there is a need, which there rarely is. There is no room in this life for hate of others, and far too many people seem to make hate their whole personality. 

A Few Things You Should Know About Me:

I am left leaning and identify most closely with the Democratic Party on most things, but I approach every issue on its own merits, so there are some issues where I take the GOP stance on, I am more than happy to answer questions you may have. 

You do not have to be a democrat by any means, but please be prepared to briefly discus politics when you reach out, to ensure our ideals align. 

I currently live in Washington state, specifically the Seattle area, so I am mainly looking for those in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), as that will make it easier for us to visit each other with some regularity, the PNW is comprised of WA, OR, northern CA, parts of ID, and part of British Columbia. If you are however outside of this area, please only reach out to me if you are able to commit to moving WA state in the near future, as I don’t expect to be in a position to leave the State anytime soon. 

I currently work in tech providing support for a software company, but I am trying to jump careers, I am happy to answer more questions about this via DM.

Please be ready to share pics with me in the first 3 days of chatting if we hit it off, and I will do the same, although I have no issues exchanging pics on day 1 either. 

What I’m Looking For:

I’m hoping to meet someone loving, funny, and full of life, someone who’s up for adventures big and small, from deep conversations over coffee to spontaneous weekend getaways. A good heart and a great sense of humor are important for me. I am looking for my forever partner, and while I am not specifically looking for marriage, I am definitely open to it with the right person. 

I want a partner who is a true friend that I can love and care for, who can also love and care for me. 

If you’re looking for a partner who will listen, laugh, and grow with you, and you are onboard with everything in my post so far, I’d love to hear from you.",2,1766344097.0,cf4cf,0,0.75,False
1psebju,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1psebju,DIY Budget espresso with FLAIR NEO second shot - unpressurized basket.,"Hello everyone,

I don't usually post my DIY stuff (or anything really) but I thought I might share this one since it is easy and clever for ultra low budget.

**Brewing Chamber**: Flair Neo Second Shot (You can take pressurized or unpressurized basket)

**Grinder**: Kingrinder P6 (That's the cheapest you can go (in my opinion) if you want unpressurized basket. Which makes sense if you aim to have an espresso machine like that)

**Tamper** (is not included with the chamber): DIY (easy if you have the necesaary power tools)

**WDT tool** (you need one - just buy one of Temu 2$. I found that 3 pin WDT is the best because of the small diameter of the basket (40mm)

**Coffee funnel** \- DIY (that one is on a lathe - you can 3d print one)

and all other **accessories** are off **Temu** and they do their job **fine**.

AND FINALLY the **manual press**.

I don't really know what to tell you. If someone is a DIY person and thinks can build it, he will build it. There are so many details about this that I need to make a whole guide.

I'm just giving the idea out here. I will  try answer a few comments I guess.

1pseatv,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1pseatv/familiar_coffee/,Familiar Coffee,"“Do you like coffee?”, the barista asks. 

Inside my heart, my mother’s coffee, 

sweet and sour, makes me say no. 

Fancy equipment brews

light powder from a scarred roasted bean 

Ethiopian sunrise in a cold Irish morning.

Like the morning warmed by tears

brewed inside the dark skin of my aunt’s grandfather 

walking free from slavery 

with nothing but a scarred, roasted being. 

Hope and aeroplane, 

new life in the old continent, 

hissing secrets of stainless steel machines.

Like my great-grandfather’s steamship, 

finding new life in the new continent, 

in my aunt’s grandfather's old job.

Importing secrets for Brazil’s black gold skinned in white

Ma non parla la nostra lingua.

I tie the black apron, scribble orders, 

walk between customers, 

struggling to breathe, to talk, to understand. 

Like my grandfather with the pesticide,

Like my grandmother, using letters she could not read

to wrap beans that didn’t smell of flowers.

As life grinds me, I grind coffee 

for a customer dressed in brown like my father’s eyes. 

Sharing a cappuccino with me at the airport as I left,

not looking behind, where my mother sobbed.

“Do you like this coffee?” I ask the customer. 

With a smirk and a slap, the mug flies off the edge of the table

Fate and family fall down

In the shards I see familiar faces. 

Black-stained marble hues of slavery,

Reflecting immigration, dissipating sweat and tears.

Drops of blood stay behind, plastered in history

As I share a coffee with my smiling wife

Warm hands around the mug

Pregnancy test and deep breath. 

The coffee smells different.

Parents/grandparents who encourage, enable, ignore annoying, dangerous, and destructive behavior.  Some “highlights” from this past few weeks:

1. Allowing kids to open and play with toys and leaving the damaged carcass behind…Every slime toy ripped open and full of hair/nasties from the floor, sand-filled silicone toys ripped open leaving the floor slippy.

2. Kids sitting in carts (fine) but watching LOUD cartoons on a phone/iPad.  You can hear it from across the store.  Brain rot videos. 😒

This goes for adults, too.  I don’t need to hear about how awful your sister is being or that so-and-so used to model underwear.

3.  Kids trying to climb stock ladders while their parents watch or are in lala land.   Kids standing in carts and trying to climb on shelves. 😬 That‘s not adorable. 

Flip side?  Parents who manhandle and yell at their kids and say, “I’m gonna beat your ass!”  Not cool. 

4.  Letting toddlers scream it out.  Absolutely the worst tantrums and parents completely ignore their screeching children.  Take your kid home.  She’s tired.  We are, too.  Nobody wants to hear your kid screaming.

Surly teens throwing crap on the floor.  I feel the same way, but I’m not making a mess for others to clean up.

5.  Entire family playing football with a stuffie, Grandma running through the store with 3 toddlers (oh, how fun!! /s)  Kids chasing each other around.  Knock it off.  There‘s sharp metal corners and glass everywhere.  

6.  If you’re gonna steal just take the whole package.  Don’t rip open a pack of merchandise and leave half of it behind.

7.  Leaving food wrappers, gum, pop cans, coffee cups, tissues, and random mystery sticky substances on shelves.  it’s the worst easter egg hunt ever.  

I’m exhausted. 🫩

But it seems that the espresso reacts in a strange way with the gellan, and I'm wondering if anyone can shed any light on it.

  
To make it, I'm making a gel with 1% low-acyl gellan, then putting 20g of that gel in 100ml water and shearing it with a stick blender to get the base gel, which has a lovely, silky texture. But when I add the espresso, the gellan immediately re-coagulates, leaving chunks of jelly that do not break up with the stick blender and remain grainy even after passing through a sieve.

  
I think it's also changing the flavour of the coffee - killing the acidity. Could it be the acid in the coffee somehow reacting with the gellan? Other acidic ingredients seem to be fine in fluid gels though...what gives?

Chroma sweater by Jaq Studio using De Rerum Natura Gilliat in Caramel, Amarante, Cypres, and Foret.

I 100% agree. That is exactly why the traditional agency/freelancer model is broken for testing.

The problem isn't that freelancers are bad; it's the ""Sunk Cost Fallacy."" If you pay $300 and wait 4 days for an edit, you are emotionally committed to running that ad even if the hook is weak. You can't afford to be wrong.

I switched my workflow to solve for \*volume of ideas\*, not just volume of output. I use an ads agent workflow that takes my static product shots and builds the video.

The reason it works (and doesn't look like generic AI slop) is a feature I haven't seen elsewhere: it gives me a ""supplementary file"" containing the raw prompt for every single scene.

If the hook is solid but Scene 3 looks weird, I don't scrap the video. I just open the file, tweak the prompt for Scene 3, and re-roll that specific clip. I can test 5 different messaging angles in an hour for the price of a coffee.

Once I know which message actually converts, \*then\* I decide if I need to hire a human for a polish.

**I’m working on the opening pages of a satirical novel inspired by modern Greek bureaucracy, reimagined as an Odyssey.**

**I’m sharing the first few pages below and would really appreciate feedback on voice, pacing, clarity for non-Greek readers, and whether the humor lands.**

 

 

**Rhapsody I - The Hero Sets Forth**

Once upon a time, not in the depths of Ithaca, but in the depths of the tax office there lived Menelaus the Digital, hero of queues and receipts.  
And one day he decided it was time to set out on a journey.

Not because fate called him,  
but because a notification arrived from Taxisnet:  
“Your declaration from 2015 is still pending.”

So, he took his folder of document, the blue folder (the sacred one) and began his journey through 21st-century Greece, a land where heroes no longer fight Trojans, but platforms, PDFs, and QR codes.

And like every Odysseus, he had a wife: Fotini the Patient, who waited for him to pass through the Citizen Service Center, the Tax Office, and two ministries before returning home.

“Menelaus, beware of the Cyclopes!” she cried.

“Which Cyclopes?” he asked.

“The civil servants who see with only one eye the official one!”

 

**Rhapsody II - The Citizen Service Center of Wonders**

And so, Menelaus the Digital set out for the Citizen Service Center, the sacred lair of signatures and stamps.  
A place where time flows differently: one minute outside, three hours inside.

Upon entering, he beheld the priests of the system, men and women with patient gazes, armed with blue pens, plastic folders, and the sword-phrase:

“You need one more supporting document.”

“But I brought everything!” cried Menelaus, in the voice of a desperate hero.  
“Copy of ID, tax form E1, certificate of family status, even my grandmother’s social security number!”

The clerk looked at him calmly.

“Yes, but you’re missing form DD-42.”

“What is that?”

“We don’t know. But it’s required.”

Menelaus froze. He remembered Tiresias, who once told him:  
“My child, never seek logic in the public sector. There, mystery reigns.”

As he waited, the hero observed the other figures in the hall:  
the grandfather seeking certification of a photocopy from 1987,  
the grandmother asking whether the CSC issues passports for dogs,  
and the young man with headphones declaring himself a “permanent resident of the internet.”

All creatures of the same universe, waiting for the divine voice of the screen:

“Number 247, counter 3!”

But Menelaus’s number was 813.

He sat down, opened his phone, and wrote on Facebook:  
“If I vanish, tell Fotini ( his wife) I was swallowed by the CSC. Send reinforcements and sesame rings.”

Hours later, his name was called.

He approached like a pilgrim.

The clerk stamped a paper with a divine sound - *THUD!*

“Are we done?” he asked.

“No, sir. You must first go to the Tax Office for a certificate, and then come back here.”

Menelaus felt his knee tremble, his vision darkens.

“My Odyssey has only just begun…” he whispered.

And he stepped back into the daylight, folder in hand  
ready to face the next enemy:

the Cyclops of the Tax Office.

 

**Rhapsody III - The Cyclops of the Tax Office**

Monday morning. The sun shone, birds sang, and Menelaus felt brave.

“Today I finish this,” he said. “Today I go to the Tax Office.”

Fotini the Patient crossed herself.  
“Take water, tissues, and courage. And do not respond if provoked.”

He arrived. At the entrance stood the guard, an old man whose eyes had seen everything.

“For what purpose have you come, young one?”

“To settle a fine,” Menelaus replied.

The guard sighed. “Oh, unfortunate soul. Enter. The Cyclops awaits.”

Deep in the corridor, behind counters and folders, lived the creature, the Cyclops of the Tax Office.

He had only one eye: the eye of his computer. And he never looked at you, only at the screen.

“Name? Tax number?”

Menelaus answered.

The eye lit up, beeped, and then thundered:

“YOU OWE.”

“But… I paid!” cried the hero.

“SYSTEM DOES NOT SEE PAYMENT.”

“But I have the receipt!”

“GO TO YOUR ACCOUNTANT.”

Menelaus froze. The beast had spoken.

Suddenly, a voice echoed from afar:

“If you wish to survive, complete form M12 and offer a copy of E1 in duplicate!”

Hands trembling, Menelaus filled the papers. He wrote, signed, endured.

At last, the monster rattled the keyboard.

“OK. THE ARRANGEMENT IS COMPLETE.  
BUT YOU WILL RETURN NEXT YEAR.”

Menelaus stepped back into the light. The air smelled of freedom and iced coffee.

“I defeated it,” he whispered. “But never again without sacrifice and pilgrimage to my accountant.”

He put on his helmet, mounted his scooter, and declared:

“Onward, to the next adventure! Now that I survived the Tax Office, not even my mother-in-law frightens me!”

And indeed, on the horizon, the next trial awaited…

**Rhapsody IV - The Return, and the Mother-in-Law as Tiresias** 

After a journey of truly epic proportions, Menelaus the Digital finally returned home.

His head was swollen with forms.  
His soul had been audited by lines, counters, and numbers that meant nothing yet ruled everything.

Fotini the Patient greeted him at the door, smiling with the calm of someone who had emotionally prepared for this years ago.

“Come on, hero. Sit down. I’ll make you something to eat before the government finds a way to tax it.”

He had barely taken his first bite when a voice echoed from the depths of the house.

A slow voice.  
A heavy voice.  
The kind of voice that sounds like it’s about to say *‘We noticed an issue with your paperwork.’*

“So… you’re back. Finally.”

It was her.

The mother-in-law.  
All-knowing. All-seeing.  
The Tiresias of the living room, no internet, no smartphone, yet somehow fully up to date.

“You’re late again,” she said.  
“I saw it on the news. Big mess at the Citizen Service Center. Basically, the DMV, but angrier.”

Menelaus felt sweat form instantly.

“Mother… it wasn’t a mess. Just a… minor Odyssey.”

She smiled. The kind of smile you see right before someone says *‘I told you so.’*

“You always do things the hard way. If you’d listened to me, you’d have gone early, brought coffee, smiled politely, and waited six hours like a normal person. That’s how you survive the system.”

“Mother, they don’t accept bribes anymore.”

“I didn’t say bribes,” she said calmly.  
“I said snacks.”

Fotini laughed quietly from the kitchen.  
Menelaus looked up at the ceiling, hoping Zeus handled customer complaints.

“So,” the mother-in-law continued, “how did the Tax Office go?”

“It was defeated.”

“Oh, defeated?” she said, unimpressed.  
“That won’t last. Something will pop up. It always does. I can feel it.”

And she could.  
She always could.

Menelaus collapsed into the armchair.

“That’s it,” he thought.  
“No more trials. No more quests. No more forms. Unless”

She raised a finger.

“I just heard the government wants everyone to get digital ID cards.  
Did you make an appointment?”

Menelaus shot upright like he’d been hit by lightning or an IRS letter.

“No. No. No. Absolutely not again.”

And as the sun set outside, Menelaus finally understood the truth.

His Odyssey was not over.

Because in Greece just like dealing with the DMV or the IRS  
every ending is merely the beginning of another form,

**I’m working on the opening pages of a satirical novel inspired by modern Greek bureaucracy, reimagined as an Odyssey.**

**I’m sharing the first few pages below and would really appreciate feedback on voice, pacing, clarity for non-Greek readers, and whether the humor lands.**

 

 

**Rhapsody I - The Hero Sets Forth**

Once upon a time, not in the depths of Ithaca, but in the depths of the tax office there lived Menelaus the Digital, hero of queues and receipts.  
And one day he decided it was time to set out on a journey.

Not because fate called him,  
but because a notification arrived from Taxisnet:  
“Your declaration from 2015 is still pending.”

So, he took his folder of document, the blue folder (the sacred one) and began his journey through 21st-century Greece, a land where heroes no longer fight Trojans, but platforms, PDFs, and QR codes.

And like every Odysseus, he had a wife: Fotini the Patient, who waited for him to pass through the Citizen Service Center, the Tax Office, and two ministries before returning home.

“Menelaus, beware of the Cyclopes!” she cried.

“Which Cyclopes?” he asked.

“The civil servants who see with only one eye the official one!”

 

**Rhapsody II - The Citizen Service Center of Wonders**

And so, Menelaus the Digital set out for the Citizen Service Center, the sacred lair of signatures and stamps.  
A place where time flows differently: one minute outside, three hours inside.

Upon entering, he beheld the priests of the system, men and women with patient gazes, armed with blue pens, plastic folders, and the sword-phrase:

“You need one more supporting document.”

“But I brought everything!” cried Menelaus, in the voice of a desperate hero.  
“Copy of ID, tax form E1, certificate of family status, even my grandmother’s social security number!”

The clerk looked at him calmly.

“Yes, but you’re missing form DD-42.”

“What is that?”

“We don’t know. But it’s required.”

Menelaus froze. He remembered Tiresias, who once told him:  
“My child, never seek logic in the public sector. There, mystery reigns.”

As he waited, the hero observed the other figures in the hall:  
the grandfather seeking certification of a photocopy from 1987,  
the grandmother asking whether the CSC issues passports for dogs,  
and the young man with headphones declaring himself a “permanent resident of the internet.”

All creatures of the same universe, waiting for the divine voice of the screen:

“Number 247, counter 3!”

But Menelaus’s number was 813.

He sat down, opened his phone, and wrote on Facebook:  
“If I vanish, tell Fotini ( his wife) I was swallowed by the CSC. Send reinforcements and sesame rings.”

Hours later, his name was called.

He approached like a pilgrim.

The clerk stamped a paper with a divine sound - *THUD!*

“Are we done?” he asked.

“No, sir. You must first go to the Tax Office for a certificate, and then come back here.”

Menelaus felt his knee tremble, his vision darkens.

“My Odyssey has only just begun…” he whispered.

And he stepped back into the daylight, folder in hand  
ready to face the next enemy:

the Cyclops of the Tax Office.

 

**Rhapsody III - The Cyclops of the Tax Office**

Monday morning. The sun shone, birds sang, and Menelaus felt brave.

“Today I finish this,” he said. “Today I go to the Tax Office.”

Fotini the Patient crossed herself.  
“Take water, tissues, and courage. And do not respond if provoked.”

He arrived. At the entrance stood the guard, an old man whose eyes had seen everything.

“For what purpose have you come, young one?”

“To settle a fine,” Menelaus replied.

The guard sighed. “Oh, unfortunate soul. Enter. The Cyclops awaits.”

Deep in the corridor, behind counters and folders, lived the creature, the Cyclops of the Tax Office.

He had only one eye: the eye of his computer. And he never looked at you, only at the screen.

“Name? Tax number?”

Menelaus answered.

The eye lit up, beeped, and then thundered:

“YOU OWE.”

“But… I paid!” cried the hero.

“SYSTEM DOES NOT SEE PAYMENT.”

“But I have the receipt!”

“GO TO YOUR ACCOUNTANT.”

Menelaus froze. The beast had spoken.

Suddenly, a voice echoed from afar:

“If you wish to survive, complete form M12 and offer a copy of E1 in duplicate!”

Hands trembling, Menelaus filled the papers. He wrote, signed, endured.

At last, the monster rattled the keyboard.

“OK. THE ARRANGEMENT IS COMPLETE.  
BUT YOU WILL RETURN NEXT YEAR.”

Menelaus stepped back into the light. The air smelled of freedom and iced coffee.

“I defeated it,” he whispered. “But never again without sacrifice and pilgrimage to my accountant.”

He put on his helmet, mounted his scooter, and declared:

“Onward, to the next adventure! Now that I survived the Tax Office, not even my mother-in-law frightens me!”

And indeed, on the horizon, the next trial awaited…

**Rhapsody IV - The Return, and the Mother-in-Law as Tiresias** 

After a journey of truly epic proportions, Menelaus the Digital finally returned home.

His head was swollen with forms.  
His soul had been audited by lines, counters, and numbers that meant nothing yet ruled everything.

Fotini the Patient greeted him at the door, smiling with the calm of someone who had emotionally prepared for this years ago.

“Come on, hero. Sit down. I’ll make you something to eat before the government finds a way to tax it.”

He had barely taken his first bite when a voice echoed from the depths of the house.

A slow voice.  
A heavy voice.  
The kind of voice that sounds like it’s about to say *‘We noticed an issue with your paperwork.’*

“So… you’re back. Finally.”

It was her.

The mother-in-law.  
All-knowing. All-seeing.  
The Tiresias of the living room, no internet, no smartphone, yet somehow fully up to date.

“You’re late again,” she said.  
“I saw it on the news. Big mess at the Citizen Service Center. Basically, the DMV, but angrier.”

Menelaus felt sweat form instantly.

“Mother… it wasn’t a mess. Just a… minor Odyssey.”

She smiled. The kind of smile you see right before someone says *‘I told you so.’*

“You always do things the hard way. If you’d listened to me, you’d have gone early, brought coffee, smiled politely, and waited six hours like a normal person. That’s how you survive the system.”

“Mother, they don’t accept bribes anymore.”

“I didn’t say bribes,” she said calmly.  
“I said snacks.”

Fotini laughed quietly from the kitchen.  
Menelaus looked up at the ceiling, hoping Zeus handled customer complaints.

“So,” the mother-in-law continued, “how did the Tax Office go?”

“It was defeated.”

“Oh, defeated?” she said, unimpressed.  
“That won’t last. Something will pop up. It always does. I can feel it.”

And she could.  
She always could.

Menelaus collapsed into the armchair.

“That’s it,” he thought.  
“No more trials. No more quests. No more forms. Unless”

She raised a finger.

“I just heard the government wants everyone to get digital ID cards.  
Did you make an appointment?”

Menelaus shot upright like he’d been hit by lightning or an IRS letter.

“No. No. No. Absolutely not again.”

And as the sun set outside, Menelaus finally understood the truth.

His Odyssey was not over.

Because in Greece just like dealing with the DMV or the IRS  
every ending is merely the beginning of another form,  
another line,  
and another appointment you swear you already made.

Her ex refused to acknowledge they were dating and was toxic and controlling their whole relationship. He was a streamer on twitch and they were long distance (both American, I am British) and whenever he was toxic or whatever to her she’d message me. they were “dating” (never official) for 3 years and I endured all the tears and stress they had within their relationship and was there for her whenever she needed from telling me she was in love to her crying at 4am because he cheated on her. E is seeing someone new and I was so happy for her because he seemed like a genuine guy, i spoke to him over instagram and we were in a call once and he was nice. The issue is all she wanted to talk about was his, pardon my french, big dick, I’m talking every other word out of her mouth was big dick and the amount of detail she went into was so insane that I could draw it from memory alone. I ignored it because I was like “fine I get it your happy it’s big whatever” and would try to change the conversation topic away from it because that alone made me feel weird. One day I sent her a voice note explaining how I’m struggling with my mental health and have been really unmotivated and don’t know what I’m doing with my life since graduating university, just telling her things I never speak to anyone about mental health-wise and she left it on read for 3 days, not unusual we get busy and do it a lot but always reply, when she replied the first thing out of her mouth was ”I miss my big dick boyfriend” and then she spoke all about how they’d slept together and how she was meeting up with a different friend for coffee later. I messaged her back saying I was upset that whenever we talk it’s purely about her boyfriend’s dick and that i never open up about my mental health and the one time i do she ignored it. she sent me a half-ass apology saying she was sorry and was busy and forgot to reply and just wanted to talk about her boyfriend but she saved the voice note i sent before replying so she could’ve easily listened to get the context (which i always do before replying to her). I haven’t spoken to her in about a month and my boyfriend thinks i should forgive her since our friendship was so close and we’d always talk. Our thing was “we are the same person in a different font” since we were so similar, the thing is, I was always there for her for 3 years whenever he ex did anything wrong and the one time i needed her she didn’t care or even listen to what i had said.

1pse1h5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pse1h5/im_seeing_a_girl_in_ofc_awkward_situation_in/,"I'm seeing a girl in ofc, awkward situation in elevator","I’m an IT fresher. Our office has three blocks. I work in the first block on the 12th floor (a dedicated ODC). I have a friend in the common ODC on the 8th floor, where no special access is needed.
During lunch time, I usually go to his floor and wait near the vending machine. There, I often see two girls chatting near the coffee machine. I don’t know what they were talking about, but I felt like they were looking at me and talking about me. This happened almost every time I visited the 8th floor 🙂‍↕️

I kinda liked one of the girls, but I was very shy and couldn’t look directly into her eyes, so I don’t remember her face clearly. Still, every time I went there, I somehow ended up seeing her. She would look at me, smile, and we would have brief eye contact.

I told my friend to keep an eye on her for me.
The next day, I saw both the girls at a mall in Chennai. I asked my friend to notice if she was looking at me again, just to confirm whether it was really me or someone else. Just like in the office, she kept looking at me there too.

The following day, I went to the office mainly because of her. I booked a seat in the common ODC and sat there.
While logging off, she and her friend were waiting for the lift, and my friend and I were also waiting for one. When the elevator arrived, all of us entered. We were going from the 8th floor to the ground floor, which took about two minutes.

My friend usually keeps his phone on loud, and it flashes when he gets a call. But that day, for some reason, his phone was on silent. She was already smiling, and it was a little awkward standing there 🙂
Suddenly, my friend received a call. The phone started flashing and got stuck — the flash stayed on all the way to the ground floor. It looked like we were filming them. The girls started laughing more, and the moment became very awkward. When we reached the ground floor, they left laughing 🙂.

It broke today, and I realized I completely forgot how to do my job.","I work in a fairly standard office role involving data entry and processing invoices. Every morning, I’m supposed to grab attachments from specific emails, parse the data, enter it into our legacy ERP system, and generate a daily report. It used to take me about 2 hours of mind-numbing clicking every morning.

About six months ago, I got fed up. I spent a weekend writing a Python script to do it all for me. It connects to Outlook, parses the PDFs, and uses an API to push the data where it needs to go.

Since then, my routine has been: arrive at work, get coffee, run the script, browse Reddit for 2 hours, then send the ""All done!"" email. My boss thinks I'm incredibly efficient and consistent.

Today, disaster struck. One of our vendors slightly changed their invoice layout. The script crashed with an error I hadn't handled.

I stared at the screen and felt a cold sweat. I realized I didn't remember the manual process. I didn't remember the login path for the specific module in the ERP system because the script handles the tokens. I had to frantically search through my old physical notebooks from my first week on the job just to figure out how to process *one* document.

It took me 4 hours to do what the script usually does in 3 minutes. My boss stopped by and asked if everything was okay because I looked stressed. I told him ""just a complex batch of data today.""

I’m currently fixing the parser at home so I don't have to actually work tomorrow. I feel like a fraud, but a very well-rested one.",333,1766343272.0,TrueOffMyChest,29,0.89,False

1psdw8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1psdw8c/your_site_is_probably_faster_for_you_than_it_is/,Your site is probably faster for you than it is for your customers. (And it’s killing your SEO),"I was auditing a client’s site yesterday and they were convinced their site was ""blazing fast."" The problem? They were viewing it on a brand-new MacBook Pro over 1Gbps fiber internet.

Their actual customers? They’re on 3-year-old iPhones using spotty 4G data at a coffee shop.

When I ran the actual metrics, the site took nearly 7 seconds to become ""interactive"" for a mobile user. That’s an eternity. Most people hit the ""back"" button after three.

If you’re running ads or trying to rank on Google, a slow site is basically a ""tax"" on your revenue. Here’s why it’s probably happening to you:

**1. The ""Heavy Image"" Trap** I see so many sites where the hero image is a 5MB uncompressed JPEG. You don't need that. Converting to WebP and properly resizing images can literally shave seconds off your load time without losing any quality.

**2. Plugin Bloat (The WordPress Special)** If you’re on WordPress and have 30+ plugins active, your site is carrying a backpack full of bricks. Half of those plugins are usually loading code on pages where they aren’t even being used. It’s ""code debt"" that your customers have to pay for in wait times.

**3. Google’s ""Core Web Vitals"" are real** Google isn't quiet about this anymore—they actively penalize slow sites in search rankings. You could have the best content in the world, but if your ""Largest Contentful Paint"" is slow, Google is going to push your competitors above you.

**The Reality Check:** A fast site isn't a ""nice to have"" anymore; it’s a requirement. If your site feels sluggish, you’re essentially paying for traffic and then throwing the door shut before they can get inside.

I’ve been doing a lot of ""performance surgery"" lately—finding the 20% of technical issues that cause 80% of the slowdown. Usually, it’s just a few bad scripts or unoptimized assets holding everything back.

**If you’re worried your site is lagging and want me to run a deep-dive performance audit, I’m happy to help you find the bottlenecks.**

**Why This Pick?**

I’m not a fan of double digit spreads, friends – but this should be a blowout, and I expect it will get ugly quick. The Raiders are coming off a shut out loss to the Philadelphia Eagles (31-0) and I won’t be surprised if today’s encounter with the Texans yields a similar result. Houston comes into this matchup on a 6-game win streak, their defense has been elite, and their offense has been the definition of solid. The Raiders don’t stand a chance here in my opinion. My money’s on the Texans to cover at home.

1psdssx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1psdssx/that_sitting_in_the_car_in_silence_feeling_after/,That 'Sitting in the Car in Silence' Feeling After a Shift...,"Hey everyone. I just got home from a 12-hour shift that felt like it lasted three business days, and I’m currently doing that thing we all do, sitting in my driveway, staring at the garage door in total silence for twenty minutes.

You know the feeling. The shift where you didn't pee once, your ""lunch"" was a cold graham cracker you found in the breakroom, and you’re pretty sure 80% of your body weight is now just caffeine and sheer willpower.

I had a moment today that really got to me. I was holding the hand of an elderly patient who had no family visiting, and for a second, the chaos of the unit just... faded. It reminded me why I chose this madness in the first place. But then, two minutes later, I was being yelled at by a family member because their Turkey sandwich didn't have enough mayo.

The duality of nursing is honestly wild. We see the absolute best and the absolute worst of humanity, all before 7:00 PM.

I’m exhausted, my compression socks are fused to my skin, and my back hurts in places I didn’t know had nerves. But I’m also weirdly proud of us?

To my fellow night shifters just starting, may your coffee be strong and your call lights be quiet. To those of you just getting off, go take that shower, eat something that isn't from a vending machine, and know that you actually made a difference today, even if it doesn't feel like it.

What’s the one thing that keeps you guys coming back shift after shift? I need some ""nursing soul food"" right about now. ",13,1766342795.0,nursing,0,0.89,False

Late autumn puts Illinois back in its oldest clothes.

Around the square, the trees stood picked clean, with color left in ragged patches of bruised gold and rust. 

The sidewalks kept the receipts: leaf mash, grit, and that tar-dark smear where a hundred soles ground the season into pulp. The town wore that river-valley burn, smoke and damp timber, a scent that drags old rooms behind it.

I reached the square ahead of schedule, parked the car two streets off the courthouse and stayed put, hands planted on the wheel. The engine clicked as it cooled. A pickup rolled past with salt grit whispering under the tires.

I let my forehead rest on the glass, not for comfort, for contact. The chill on the window had more honesty than my thoughts.

The notebook went across my lap. I stared down that first blank line and waited.

*‘You came back,’* I wrote. 

That sentence sat there and mocked me from the page. 

I drove the pen down hard enough to split the paper. The torn strip came free. I worked it into a small ball and kept it pinched in my fist until the edges bit. I dropped it on the floormat, then let my hand find my phone. 

One thread from an unknown number, dated four years back. 

*‘We still doing this?’*

*‘Yeah, I’m here, don’t worry.’*

*‘Where should I meet you?’*

*‘By the square. Coffee shop.’*

*‘Don’t get anything without me!’*

I read it again. Then again, as if the words might rearrange into a better ending. 

I jammed the phone into my pocket and stepped out. 

The visitor center sat in an old brick building that once housed a bank. Brass fixtures. Tall windows. Out front, the flag snapped and cracked in the wind with the tired duty of its work. 

Inside, heat met my face and made my skin sting.

Behind the counter, a woman sat with her hair pinned back. “You looking for a map?” she asked. “You look lost.”

“The audiobook,” I said. My voice came out rougher than I meant. “The walking tour.”

Recognition came over her features. “Ah. You know, you’re the third one this week. Folks come out this way when the leaves turn. It’s a pretty little tour. Do you want the earbuds or you got your own?”

“I’ve got my own.”

“QR code’s on the brochure,” She slid a pamphlet across the counter. “It’s free, but the donation jar sits there if you feel moved.” Her chin tipped toward a glass box with a few bills and coins. “People get attached to our little author. She’s a wonderful writer.”

“I know.”

She rested her forearms on the counter and sized me up in the way clerks do when they have judged a thousand visitors. 

“You a teacher or something?” she asked. “You got that beat-down look.”

“I write,” The word landed wrong in my mouth, too heavy for what I had earned.

“Oh.” She let that sit. “Books?”

“Attempts.”

That earned a fair smile. “Gotcha. Well, at least you’re honest about it.”

I took the brochure and moved off to the side to scan the code. The title rose on my screen with a sepia portrait of the author. 

She sat posed with distance and discipline. Early 1900s. Local legend. The sort of woman a town makes useful once she is dead, pressed into crests and postcards.

The bell over the door rang behind me.

“You chose the worst day for the cold,” a woman's voice said.

I turned.

She stood just inside, coat pockets swallowing her hands, hair torn loose by the wind, cheeks red from the walk. Familiarity settled on me and stung. 

Her attention went past me toward the counter, pausing there, waiting for the world to do what it used to do. The clerk gave her nothing.

“You’re late,” I said.

Her smile came small, worn at the edges. “You were early.”

“You get the code?” she asked.

“Yeah.”

“Good.” She came closer. Clean shampoo and cold air clung to her coat. It brought the ache up fast, right under my sternum. “Let’s go before you talk yourself into quitting this whole thing.”

“I’m already halfway there.”

“I know.” Her eyes held me in place. “Just humor me. We can have one more good day between us.”

We left the visitor center and stopped on the sidewalk with the brochure open between us. The paper fought the gusts and knocked against my coat, impatient for its turn to speak.

The tour started at the courthouse steps, then ran a tight loop through storefronts and alley mouths, past a church steeple aimed at low clouds, then down toward the river where the old factories sat shut in rust.

I set one earbud in place and offered the other.

She took it from me, her fingers brushing against my palm.

The courthouse stood in front of us, stone darkened by rain and soot, carrying its age without shame.

I hit play.

A woman spoke from my phone, clear and composed, a modern narrator wearing the old world influence. 

Our first stop gave the usual facts: name, dates, the town’s polished pride. Then the excerpt came, and the town in front of me changed shape under the weight of her words.

The courthouse stopped being a building and became a stage set for a story about a man who returned home too late, carrying a letter he could not bring himself to open. The narrator described the stone steps, the iron railing, the square courtyard.

My own drafts rose up in my mind: pages scarred with scratches, paragraphs that caved in before they reached their point. 

“You’re doing that thing already,” she said.

“What thing?”

“That thing where you let yourself go somewhere else.”

“I’m standing right here.”

“No, you’re not.” She shifted closer, cuff brushing my sleeve again. “You hear her stories, then you start putting your pages against hers. I can practically read the words written on your face.”

“It’s hard not to appreciate her work. People love her.”

“People love you too.”

The tour kept going. Each sentence landed where it meant to land. No wobble. No second-guessing.

“You can still stop this,” she said. “Tonight doesn’t have to-.”

I kept my face toward the courthouse and gave her nothing. “Let me have this. Please.”

I set my attention down the street where the next marker waited. Bronze bolted to brick. The sort of civic token locals pass for years without granting it a second thought.

We walked towards it together.

“You remember this spot,” she asked.

“I remember you here,” I told her. “You had that scarf. The green one.”

“I still hate that scarf.”

“I liked it. It matched your eyes. In fact, I’d say that scarf got you kissed.”

Her face drew inward, but the warmth stayed. “So was that your plan that night?”

“To kiss you? No. The only plan I had was to not mess it all up.”

“But you did mess it all up.”

I let out a small laugh that had no warmth in it. “How?”

“You talked too much.”

“I always talk too much.”

“You asked me what I thought about death.”

“Was that bad? It was just a question.”

“On a third date.”

“I thought it was a good question.”

“It was a terrible question.”

The narration in my ear cut through our bickering.

The author placed a woman at an upstairs window, pinned there while the square carried on below. Men passed beneath her. Life kept its schedule. 

The brick in front of me took on a part to play, and an upstairs window formed in my mind with the woman set behind the glass. The town fell into line, obedient to the story.

She studied me with the face she used to wear when she knew my thoughts had slipped its leash.

“Say it,” she said. “Tell me what her writing does to you. I want to hear about it.”

“It makes me want to pitch my notebook into the river.”

“Why?”

“Because she doesn’t have to beg the reader to forgive her for dumb repetition and poor concepts.”

“And you think you do?”

“I know I do.”

Air left her through her nose in a thin stream. “Then quit begging. Start writing like you love your own work. It'll shine through, I promise.""

I tapped at the volume button, hunting for an excuse to change subjects.

A couple came up behind us, older, bundled in matching coats that had seen a few winters. The man cleared his throat in that polite Midwestern manner strangers do when they want you to move without asking.

I stepped aside. She stepped with me.

They leaned in toward the plaque.

“Is this the one with the river?” the woman asked.

“No,” the man said. “That’s later. This is the widow one. See.”

Their talk stayed inside their own small circle. They took what they wanted from the bronze and left the rest. They moved on, already halfway to the next stop.

“There,” she said, pointing down the block. “That coffee shop. It used to be a bakery. Remember?”

“I think I do. But it smells better in my memory.”

“That’s because you only remember the good parts.” She paused and angled her face toward me. “I remember you catching your toe on the first step. You tripped.”

“I did not.”

“You did.”

“I recovered pretty quick though.”

Her mouth held a small victory. “I don’t know if you recovered, but you definitely tried to play it off.”

“I was saving my dignity.”

“You were definitely trying.”

We pushed into the coffee shop. Ground beans and burnt sugar hung in the store. A young man with a pierced eyebrow stood behind the counter, dragging a rag along his stained apron.

“What can I get you?” he asked.

I hesitated. Years ago, I ordered black coffee. I wanted her to think I was interesting. Serious. A man worth keeping.

“Don’t do the black coffee again.”

“What if I want it?” I asked.

The barista’s eyes narrowed. “Sorry, what was that?”

I blinked. “No, sorry,” I said. “Just thinking.”

He gave me that practiced smile people earn in service work. “All good. So, what do you want?”

“Coffee,” I said. “Black.”

“All right.” He turned to the register. “Anything else? Any food with that?”

“No.”

He rang it up and set the cup down a minute later. “Stay warm out there.”

“Thanks.”

We stepped back onto the sidewalk with the cup sending up steam. I took a pull and the bitterness struck.

“Why do you always do that,” she asked.

“Do what.”

“Pick the thing that hurts.”

I set my focus down the street where the next stop waited. It hadn't changed much. Same display windows. Same crosswalk paint. Same old cracks in the concrete. 

Each one brought a small pressure behind my eyes, the sort that warns you what’s coming. 

The street edges started to lose their firmness and the world threatened to slip its rails. My vision got wet.

She took my hand and steadied me.

“Hey,” she said. “Breathe. Stay with me.”

I tried. Air snagged in my throat, then broke through in a rough draw that scraped on the way out.

“We're almost done.” I said.

I anchored myself back to the phone screen, the neat progress bar, the calm certainty of sentences marching forward without doubt, without second-guessing, without any sign of the ugly labor that must have come first.

And I heard myself from years ago, outside this same alley, trying to sound worth her time.

*‘I’m working on something,’* I told her then. *‘It’s not good yet, but it will be.’*

She answered, ‘*Then keep working on it. I can’t wait to see it when it's finished.’*

I had believed her. I had built whole months on those words. I had used them to get up, to shower, to fake an ordinary morning, to sit with my pages and pretend there was a future waiting for me. 

Now I walked with that old sentence pressed to the roof of my mouth, sour from being chewed on too long.

“I can’t do what she does.” I gave the phone a single shake, the anger small but real. 

Heat gathered behind my lids again. I fought it back.

“You know it’s okay to cry,” she said.

“I’m fine.”

“You aren’t.”

I kept my attention on the plaque in front of me until the letters ran together. 

In the glass behind it, the street offered its sight. Me with my collar up, coffee sending up steam. The glass gave only what the town could hold.

She stepped between me and the glass and took the truth away.

“Tell me what you meant earlier,” she said. “What does her writing do to you? I don't want you dodging it this time.”

I pulled the earbud free and pinned it against my cuff, the cord laid across my wrist. With the narrator cut off, the street went plain again. 

“I don’t know how to put it into words,” I said.

“Try for me.”

Dread rose the way it always did when I had to name what lived in me. The worry that if I spoke, it would sound small and childish. The worse worry that if I did not, I would keep it inside until it leaked out later in worse ways.

“It’s… the feeling,” I said. “Well… When I read her work. When I hear how she writes. It turns the past into something you can almost touch.”

She let that stand alone. Space, offered without rescue.

I tried for words again. “It’s like nostalgia. But it’s not some warm blanket thing. It’s a person.”

“Nostalgia’s a person?”

“A girl, actually.” I took a step, then another, as if movement could make it simpler to say.

“In my mind I’m not in this town anymore,” I said. “It’s a prairie in autumn. Grass gone amber. Seedheads ticking. Cottonwoods along a creek throwing coins of gold. The sky sits huge over it all, washed clean. Fence posts cut a straight line into the distance. A windmill turns and turns and never gets tired.”

She stayed with me and let me spill it, even when the words came crooked.

“She runs out there,” I said. “That girl runs across open ground where nothing blocks her way. A dress flares behind her when the wind catches it. Her hair snaps once, then settles, then snaps again. I hear a laugh from her now and then, then it breaks apart and goes with the gusts.”

“And do you catch her?” she asked.

“No.” The word came out bitter. “I close the distance. I get near enough to catch the edge of cloth, feel her warmth, then she runs faster. She clears the next rise and the prairie opens up again, empty and perfect.”

I set the earbud back in place. The narrator returned mid-sentence, unbothered, with no regard for what it had opened in me. It felt cruel, that clean return.

“You’re shaking,” she said.

“I’m just cold.”

“You’re not cold.”

I hated that she could still call me out. I hated it even more that she still did it with care.

“You said something close to that before, you know,” she said. “Years ago.”

“I didn’t.”

“You did.” She angled herself toward the cross street. “Right there. You said the best parts of life never stay long enough. You said it made you feel greedy, wanting them to last forever.”

I tried to deny it and my tongue failed me. The next sentence came back on its own, dragged up from some old pocket in me where I kept it safe.

“I was an idiot,” I said.

“You were a man trying to be something,” she said. “You still are. So stop punishing that version of you. You did what you could with what you had.”

We reached the next stop. The marker sat low by a planter, half swallowed by dead stems.

The narrator began a new excerpt and I leaned into the sound, chasing that prairie girl in my mind.

*‘Keep walking*,’ she said near my ear. 

I couldn’t tell which girl it was. 

*‘Don’t stop here. Don’t make this your destination. There’s so much more left to see.*’

The narrator kept its calm, but the content shifted. The excerpt began talking about a man outside a storefront, stalling, rehearsing a conversation that could ruin him.

*‘Hey, I’ve been thinking about you.’*

*No. That’s stupid. It's a third date.*

*‘Hi, do you like coffee?’*

*Also stupid.*

*‘Hey, I’m glad you made it.’* 

My wrist locked over the phone. I checked the screen, hunting for the tour title, the author credit, anything that would prove I was still inside the same file.

“Did you hear that?” I asked.

“Hear what,” she asked.

“Those lines.”

She paused, then gave a flat answer. “I don’t know. Maybe it’s part of the story.” 

Her sleeve grazed mine. The sensation registered, then failed, like the town had decided it could not afford her for very much longer.

The narrator said, “He told himself he was only here for the tour. He told himself that if he walked the route, he might meet the man he used to be. Maybe even more.”

I pivoted toward the shop window across the street.

The glass offered its truth again. My reflection. The buildings behind me. The gray sky. No second figure at my side. Not now. Not ever. 

Just me in a coat, lids raw, wires in my ears, a brochure pinned against my chest.

“You see,” she said. “You’re not fooling anyone. Not even yourself.”

My mouth set. “Please don’t make me the town lunatic.”

“You aren’t,” she said. “You’re a man in grief. That’s all. There’s no shame in that.”

“There is,” I said. “There is shame in still being this way. There is shame in needing you. It’s been years.”

Her eyes held mine. “You don’t need me,” she said. “You never did. You know that. I know that.”

“I don’t know what that means.”

“You do,” she replied. 

“Then what am I supposed to do,” I said. “Walk around town with no one to talk to? Go back to the hotel room and stare at the ceiling?”

A few passersby turned their faces our way.

“You’ve been doing that already,” she said. “For a long time.”

“That’s not true.”

“It is true.” Her words stayed kind. 

“Stop,” I said, too loud. 

“Not this time.” She stood her ground. “You can still turn things around, I know you can.”

“Then why do you keep talking to me?”

She cupped my cheeks in her palms. Her face held the version I kept, the one I carried through years of ordinary mornings. Out here, the street did not give her to me in any solid way. 

Still, my heart ached.

“I’m here because you keep pulling me along,” she said. “You can do this yourself if you just give yourself a chance.”

“I’m only pulling you along because you moved on without me,” I said. The words came out flat, then broke at the end. “You moved on and I couldn’t and I still don’t want to lose you.”

Her attention fell to the sidewalk, then returned to me. 

“I did,” she said. “I wanted a life. I wanted to have mornings that did not begin with me trying to fix you. I wanted a home where I did not have to talk you down from your own thoughts every night.”

“Just say it,” I said. “Just say the whole thing. Put it all on the pavement and let me hear it from your own mouth.”

“He’s been decent to me,” she said. “He’s boring in a way you used to laugh at, and I mean that in the best possible way. He doesn’t perform for anyone. He doesn’t test our relationship. He just wakes up, makes coffee, and asks about my day.”

“And you are going to have a family with him,” I asked.

“Yes.”

There it was. 

Not a knife. 

A door shutting. 

The sound of it carried down a long hall and left me standing on the wrong side of it.

I stared past her to the end of the block. 

“I hate you for telling me that,” I said.

“I know,” she answered. “You also hate me for not telling you sooner. You hate me for leaving. You hate me for staying in your head. At this point I don’t know what you would have liked from me.”

A laugh tried to climb out of me, ugly and wrong. I crushed it against my fist and swallowed the rest.

“You’re not even real enough to deserve that hate.”

“I’m real enough to have kept you going for a while,” she said. “I got to be your comfort for a time. That must count for something.”

I picked up the brochure again. The arrows looked childish now, like someone drew a game on paper to keep a restless child from wandering off.

“So, that’s what you’ve been doing this whole walk?”

“Yes.”

“To what end,” I asked. “To make me strong? To make me noble? To make me write a better ending for the night?”

Her mouth set. “I just want you to live with yourself.”

“That sounds worse than dying,” I said, and meant it. 

The space between us felt full, then empty, then full again. 

“You keep waiting for someone to choose you so you can finally forgive yourself. That day never comes if you refuse to do it first.”

My focus dropped to nothing.

“Is this the part where you ask me if you can leave?”

Air caught in her throat. The smallest thing. Then she gave a single assent. “Yes.”

I wanted to seize her wrist. I wanted to beg. I wanted to bargain with a memory, and that need in me felt humiliating.

The last stop waited up ahead near the square. The place where the reenactment began. The place where I would have to stand alone.

I gave a nod with the smallest motion I could manage, because anything larger would have put me on the sidewalk, turned into a story for strangers.

“Go,” I said. “If you really need to leave.”

Her face eased. Relief crossed her features, not for herself, for me. 

“Thank you,” she said.

Then the street took her away. No flash. No wind. No warning. One beat she stood beside me, the next beat she did not. 

I set the earbud back in place and hit play. The narrator continued as though nothing had happened.

“He reached the square again,” it said, “and found that the town had never promised him a reunion.”

I walked the last blocks without company. The town let me pass without ceremony. The square offered no final lesson, no ribbon on the end, just cold air and the ordinary grind of life.

At the front desk of the hotel a kid with a lanyard looked up from his phone.

“How’d the tour go?”

My mouth opened. Nothing came.

He took that for a normal answer and kept going. “Weather’s turning. You get a chance to hit the riverwalk?”

“No.”

“Probably for the best. Wind’ll cut you in half down there. Need anything else?” he asked.

“No.”

“Cool. Have a good one.”

I took the stairs because the elevator had mirrors and I did not want a box full of my own face. Not that night. 

My key card stuck, then gave. The door opened on the same small room I left that morning. Curtains half drawn. Bedspread pulled flat. The room stank of detergent, stale heat, and that sweet vent-perfume hotels pump through the ducts.

I shut the door with the click of the latch, dropped my keys into the little dish by the lamp, kicked off my shoes, and stood there, waiting for something.

That was when the chair by the window registered. Someone was sat in it.

Not a stranger. Not a shadow. 

A person sat there with his legs spread in a tired slouch, one ankle on the opposite knee, palms laid across his stomach. The overhead light put a dull shine on his skin. He wore my coat. My jeans. My expression.

He had my face, but he wore it without strain, without that mask I dragged around in public. He angled toward me, taking his time.

“Hey,” he said. “You made it back.”

The words were mine. No tremble in them. No apology.

“No.”

He let a beat pass. “No what.”

“This is not happening.”

“If telling yourself that helps, alright.”

“What is this,” I asked. “Who are you?”

His attention passed to the brochure, then to the earbuds still looped around my fingers. “You took the long way around to arrive at the same place.”

“That’s not an answer to my question.”

“It is,” he said. “You came here to meet with me. That’s why I’m here. No matter what happened today, this was always going to be what was waiting for you. You just kept a blanket over me for a while.”

I reached for the light switch on the wall, hoping brightness might change things. The lamp came on. He stayed where he was, calm as can be, taking me in.

“You’re not real,” I said.

He gave a small nod, agreeable. “Sure.”

“Don’t act reasonable.” I bit. “Nothing about this is reasonable.”

He leaned forward and set his forearms on his knees. “What, you want me in here screaming? You want me to throw things? Would that make it easier? Then you could tell yourself I’m the bad guy and you’re just the victim. Just like always, right?”

“Well, aren’t you?”

A sound left him that could have been a laugh if it carried any joy. “No.”

“What are you then?”

He glanced down at his hands. “I’m what you get when you finally stop borrowing her voice.”

“So I’m losing it.”

“You’ve been losing it,” he said. “This is just a clearer view of what has been going on inside your head.”

I put my palm on the dresser to steady it, or myself, I don’t know. “Then what are you here for? To scare me?”

He refused with one small motion. “I’m not here to scare you. I’m here to sit with you. Because, let’s be honest, no one else is going to.”

A scoff broke out of me, thin and mean. “That’s rich.”

He let it pass. “Why didn’t you write anything today?”

“You know why. I was walking all day.”

“And you still didn’t write anything down?”

“I wasn’t here to write.”

He raised his brows, mild. “Then why did you bring the notebook with you?” 

He rose with restraint and came around the foot of the bed. Close enough that small facts showed themselves. The chapped place by his lower lip. The faint bruised shade under his lids.

Those details felt wrong to me for a reason. One awful reason. 

I had never stayed with my own reflection this long without pulling away. 

“You did the hard part out there,” he said. “You finally let her go.”

“Don’t. I don’t want to talk about that.”

He spoke with less edge. He was not armed. He didn’t need to be. “Okay. We won’t talk about her. Not yet.”

 “Just tell me what you want.”

He looked past me toward the bed, toward the clean sheets and the dark gap beneath them. “I want you to stop fighting for a life you don’t even enjoy living.”

“That’s not true. I’m happy enough.”

“Then tell me what you enjoy. Not what you used to enjoy. Not what you tell people you enjoy. Tell me what you really enjoy. Right now.”

I opened my mouth and nothing came. Not even a lie.

He stepped closer until there was only a narrow strip of shadow between us.

“I’m not here to hurt you,” he said. “I’m here to help you.”

“Help me what?”

He angled his head. “To rest. Just to rest. Nothing more than that.”

“Rest?”

His eyes held mine, confident and warm.

“Yeah,” he said, quiet. “Just rest. No more words. No more proving yourself. No more begging someone to love you.”

He lifted his hand, palm open, offering it without a rush.

“Come with me and sit down,” he said. “I’m doing you a favor tonight.” His mouth lifted at the edges. “I know you hate that. I get it. Favors feel like a crutch and asking for help makes them feel less genuine. That's why you cut everyone out of your life, right?”

“This isn’t fair,” I said.

“What isn't?”

“This.” I lifted both hands, the room, the bed, the clean lamp light, the chair he had claimed. “You in here. Me in here. Me having to listen to you.”

“But you’ve already been listening to me for such a long time already. It's only right you see my face this time.”

“Yeah, but it’s always the same,” I said. “It’s always only you. It’s always this one voice. I only get one side of the argument.”

Something softened in his face, and I hated that too. “You want to hear from the other side?”

“I just want a chance,” I said. “I want it to be balanced. I want it to be fair.”

He nodded once as if I had finally asked for something worthwhile. “Okay. Then let’s invite it in.”

“Invite what in?”

“Your hope,” he said, plain. “If it bothers you that I’m the only one here, then bring in the part of you that fights back. Bring in the thing that challenges me over you.”

“That’s not how this works.”

“Yes it is,” he said. “You made someone walk beside you all day. You can do this too. It's easy. Anyone can do it.”

The wires from the earbuds still tightened around my fingers, cutting off the blood, and I realized I had been holding them the way a child holds a cross.

“Fine.” 

He raised his voice only enough for it to fill the room. “All right then, Hope. Come inside. We welcome you in.”

My attention went to the door.

The other me followed my eyes.

We waited.

The room did not change. The heater kept its hiss. The curtains held their half-drawn line. The latch did not move. 

Nothing stepped through the door because nothing could. 

“This was a stupid idea.”

He kept his eyes on the door for one beat longer, a brief moment of fear, then he brought his focus back towards me. 

“Is it? Then tell me to stop waiting. You’re in charge here. Tell the world the game is over. No one else is invited.”

“It's over,” I said. “You made your point.”

“Okay. It’s done.”

Heat crept up my neck, the mean kind. I felt like an idiot. “You knew that wouldn’t work.”

“I did. But I wanted you to see it,” he said.

“See what?”

“That your hope’s dead.” he said. Calm, like a man reading the paper. “You let her go... Man, you really did love her, didn’t you?”

My teeth met. “Don’t do that.”

“Remember that night,” he said. “In the parking garage? Those headlights. The way her face lit up when that car swung past. The love on her face. I wonder if her new fiancé gets to see that look.”

“Stop it.”

“I bet he does. Probably when they’re-”

“I said stop.”

“Don’t get angry with me. You asked for balance,” he said. “I gave you a fair test. Since your hope didn’t show up, you have me tonight and I’ll do exactly what I want to do.”

“Just don't talk about her,” I said, and the words came out with bite because I needed them to be heard. “I want her to be happy.”

He lifted a finger, not accusing, more like a teacher who refuses to let you skip a problem. “Do you? Remember when you used to pray that she’d leave you? When you used to look at her and realize you might be looking at the only woman you’d ever be with? You were so scared of that. 

“Can I ask you why? Was it because you thought you could do better? Maybe you deserved better. Was that it? The good news is God answered your prayer. She left you. Greener pastures all around, right?”

“I didn’t know what I wanted back then,” I said. “I was young. I didn’t know what I had.”

“You had a person who got tired,” he said. “Tired of you. Tired of your brain. Tired of your vulnerability. Now you’re asking an empty room to console you on her behalf? You know I won't do that for you. So I have to ask, was all of this worth it?”

I turned away from him and set my regard on the little Bible on the nightstand, uncreased. A notepad waited beside it, blank page open in insult.

“I’m not doing this,” I said. “Not with you.”

“You are,” he said. “You drove all the way down here to do this. Now there is nothing left but to do but stage it.”

“I don't want to fight with you. I just want this to end.”

“I know,” he said. “If you walk out of this hotel in the morning, do you think you’ll actually feel better?”

“People do it. People get better.”

He held my eyes. “Do they? Or do they learn new phrases for the same pain. It seems like a lot of pretending to me. A lot of masking.”

“That’s ironic coming from you.”

“From us,” he corrected.

“You know I have work I want to do,” I said. “Stories. Real ones. I want to finish something that doesn’t fall apart. I want to make something that matters to someone.”

“And then what,” he asked.

“And then I’ll feel,” I began, and stopped because even in my own mouth it sounded childish.

He let the silence sit there until I had to fill it.

“And then I’ll feel like someone wanted me,” I said. “I’ll feel worth something.”

“By who.”

“Readers,” I said. “An editor. Anyone.”

He dipped his chin. “So the plan is the same as always. Wait for someone else to hand you a little bit of affection, drink that well dry then move on. How many years have you been doing that now?”

“It’ll be different this time,” I said again, keeping the words soft. “I'll work on myself.”

“No, you won't,"" he replied. “Every time someone offers you a kindness, you demand a receipt for it. Every time you hit a goal, you put it on trial. Here's a good question for you, how are your friends doing?”

I paused. “I couldn’t say.”

“Didn’t they just have a get-together?”

“They did.”

“And you weren’t there.”

“No.”

“So, why didn’t you go?”

“They forgot to ask me.” A tremor ran through my arms. I hid it by jamming my hands into my pockets. 

He moved one step closer. Now he was near enough that my own stale coffee stink showed itself on him, the old bitterness still clinging.

“They forgot,” he said. “Isn’t that worse than them outright excluding you?”

“I don't know.” I kept my focus on the hush he wore.

“No one will love you,” he said. “You know that much. Folks tolerate you. They enjoy you in small doses. But you don’t matter to them. That’s okay, though. Why don't you just stop dragging yourself through seasons hoping the next one fixes you?”

“If I sit down with you,” I asked, “what changes?”

“You tell me the truth,” he said. “Out loud. No audience. Just you and me. Then you ask the world, ‘don’t I matter?’ After that you let the noise stop. Maybe someone out there will even miss you.”

I sat down. Not because I trusted him, or because I wanted peace, but because my legs stopped taking orders from whatever proud scrap still lived in my chest. 

“Come on then,” he said. “Tell me the truth.” 

I took my notebook. The pen lay across the open page. The blankness waited.

“What do you want me to say to you,” I asked.

He let out a small, humorless puff through his nose. “Start with the part you keep stepping around.”

“All right,” I said. “I’m lonely. I’m tired. I’m embarrassed of how needy I’ve become. I resent people who wake up and move through a day without bargaining with it. I resent her for leaving. I resent myself for giving her reasons to leave. I resent this town for staying the exact same while I came apart.”

He gave a single, firm assent. “Good.”

“Good,” I echoed, and the word tasted rotten. “Do you want more? You always want more.”

In the lamp glow, my hands showed first, then his, then mine again, and my mind kept trying to decide what belonged to him and what belonged to me.

“I do,” he said. “You have been paying rent on pain for years. You called it growth. You called it character. You called it work. But it was only ever rent. Month after month. No ownership. No peace. Just a cycle that keeps going day after day.”

“Do you have a way to fix this,” I asked.

“You know I do,” he said. “You came to this town because you wanted an ending. But I want you to think about tomorrow,” he said. “Not as a concept. As a thing. Do you really want it?”

I dragged a hand across my face and felt the roughness of my own stubble.

“I can’t keep doing tomorrow,” I said.

“I know.”

“But I don’t want to die,” I said, and the honesty startled me.

“No, but you don’t want to live like this either. So tell me what’s worse, seeing another tomorrow, or finally getting some sleep?”

The room blurred at the edges, not from weakness, from depletion, from the long labor of staying upright. 

I had fought him for a thousand nights and told myself the fight meant I was winning. I never admitted that the fight might just be the slow shape of surrender.

I took the pen and set it on a fresh page.

He stayed behind me, near enough that warmth reached the back of my neck.

“If you’re going to keep pushing,” I said, “let me do one last thing.”

“What thing?”

“I want to write,” I said. “One last story. Something clean. Something finished. No more drafts.”

He was quiet for a moment, then he spoke with a kindness that felt like a hand closing around my throat.

“Okay,” he said. “One last story. What are you going to call it?”

I stared at the top of the blank page until my eyes stopped trying to run away.

The title came up from the name of the chase I mistook for love, for talent, for hope.

I wrote it down in thick letters.

I’ve been scrolling this sub and it looks like an incredible city! My husband and I (in our early 30s) are thinking about moving out here from across the country so we can be closer to our family who lives in Catonsville. We are looking for an area that is close enough that we can visit family once maybe twice a week but far enough that we can live our own lives. 

Things about us: 
•We have a 2 year old who is extremely interested in all things sports. 
• We both work in tech. So we would want to be in an area that we could commute if needed
• We love coffee and walking around with our toddler after a family coffee date 
• We have a dog who we love going on walks and hikes with 
• We are both into road/gravel biking 

We are also interested in hearing about the schools out here since it will likely be a long term move. 

Thanks so much for reading and commenting!

Ok good…pass me the cookie flavored coffee creamer….,"43, married, couple kiddos, couple doggos and I’m currently stretching before taking on shopping at Costco like it’s a sanctioned sport.

Life these days is a humbling mix of kids who roast me daily and somehow still want pancakes the moment I sit down with yummy coffee. Weekends are cozy clothes, a golden floof who treats my socks like enemy combatants, and exactly three peaceful sips of creamy coffee before chaos resumes.

I am totally staying active enough to justify absolutely unhinged Christmas cookie behavior. That involves some running, the occasional workout, and a lot of dramatic yard sprints chasing my floof like I’m training for the Dad Olympics.

Love some tasty coffee (festive, creamy, and quietly judging black-coffee drinkers), suspiciously good at building charcuterie boards I fully snack on mid-assembly, and a fearless cook who follows vibes instead of recipes. My lifelong goal is to hear, “Dad… okay, that actually slaps,” delivered with genuine respect.

Almost no one talks about **how fast your body actually absorbs it**.

Quick breakdown 👇

☕ **Coffee**

* Slow digestion
* Stomach-dependent
* Often comes with jitters, crashes, and bad breath

🥤 **Energy drinks**

* Liquid + sugar = spike then crash
* Slower onset than people think

🟡 **Caffeine gum**

* Oral absorption (not stomach-first)
* Fast-acting caffeine
* More controlled, smoother energy
* No sugar overload, no coffee breath

Buzzin was built around **clean, fast, controlled energy** — not another drink you have to finish or crash from.

We’re not anti-coffee.  
We’re pro **knowing what actually works**.

1psdq7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1psdq7k/my_predicament_is_reality_dead/,My predicament: is reality dead?,"I have a bizarre and macabre story that I am perplexed to write; I have written it and deleted it a couple of times, concerned that it will affect the readers as terribly as it affected me. Even when I am writing, I can't tell what is real and what isn't. I am unable to distinguish reality from fiction.

In the end, I will write it as it happened to me, but I will change some details such as names, locations, and descriptions.

  


It all started with my acquaintance, let's call him John, who happens to be from Arkansas or Kansas, I can't recall. Anyway, I met him at a scientific conference overseas. We talked about a selection of topics, including science, philosophy, cinema, and pseudoscience. He also told me about a psilocybin mushroom compound that he is developing. That has the potential to expand the human brain's capacity beyond its present boundaries.

""John, you realize that we are talking about nonsensical things,"" I said.

""Ah, the skeptic scientist,"" And he adds, ""What is life if we are not willing to take risks and push the boundaries of the scientific pursuit, right?""

I did not respond to him.

He went on, ""How do you know right now that you are not dreaming?""

""I feel, see, and do things,"" I said.

""Even in your sleep, you feel and do things.""

""But it isn't the same,"" I replied.

""Why is that?""

'When you dream, the things that happen are random,"" I said, ""one second you're in a car, the next you're flying; the dream sequences are chaotic.""

""Have you seen The Matrix?""

""Yes""

""When Neo, the protagonist, took the red pill and awakened in his new reality, how do we know he is not still sleeping?""

""We are heading towards philosophy, plus the sleep regression will stop at some point.""

""But why?'

""Because it is not sound, the regression will not reach infinity.""

""Why wouldn't it go for infinite?""

""It is similar to the Archimedean point, so there will be a point we identify as real or reality""

""Can this reality be real?'

""Now we're discussing semantics,"" I replied. ""Let's say reality as opposed to not real, fiction, or dream, so when you wake up, that's reality.""

""According to your conclusion, reality is subjective?""

""It's objective and if we compare it to something else, we will know it is real, just as we can presently tell the difference between the real world and the dream world.""

""What about death?""

""What about it?'

""How you know that your alive and not dead?""

""I'm not following""

""How do we know that we are not actually dead and that our minds think we are alive? Don't tell me biological reasons...

I intervened, ""Just like ghosts?""

He declared, ""Supernatural.""

I started laughing, ""You know we're supposed to be scientists?""

""Just humor me.""

""All right, the difference is that we are living our lives and following our passions."" I add sarcastically, ""I don't have a PhD in ghost studies, but I think ghosts have no purpose or passion because they are dead.""

""You watched or read The Shining?""

""Yeah, I don't think movies or novels are great arguments, but even if they have a purpose, it will be related to the next life, so if someone is dead, he will be biologically dead in our world, but his soul will continue."" I went on, ""I suppose we need to agree on the definition of ""alive."" If we take it in the broader sense, then sure, spirits and ghosts are living things, but in the strict sense, it will rely on the biological definition.""

""I agree, if my research result is correct, we will be able to cross the fine line of these distinctions""

""You mean there's no distinction between the living and the dead?""

""Exactly, supernatural and natural will be the same.""



I didn't say anything, and I don't think he's nuts. I don't think he believed what he was saying; perhaps he needed a friend to talk to or impress. After our long and bizarre conversation, we returned to our own lives, he to the United States and I to my home country. I hadn't seen John in over 5 years, and I lost contact with him three years after our meeting.

  


I suffer from insomnia and severe headaches.

Sometimes medication help, sometimes they don't.



One night in a dream, I saw John dressed as a Native American chieftain; I forgot to mention that he has both European and Native American ancestors. He is from the Blackfoot tribe. He sat in front of a bonfire and looked sad.

""Come sit with me."" he said

I sat beside him, looking at the fire, and he told me that he was dead, and he opened a door to the other side, a very terrifying place, and something has entered our world.

""What do you mean?"" I asked, "" What other place?""

'A place called by the Egyptian as Duat""

""The underworld?""

""Yes""

""Who came from the other side?"" I exclaimed.

I saw John trying to say something, but I was unable to hear him because his sound was muffled out by another strong sound of thumping and whirring, like an earthquake, then the bonfire was extinguished and very cold darkness fell over us all, and I awakened from my sleep, sweating and breathing frantically.

And all I can hear now is the construction workers outside using their Hammer drills.

  


My apartment looks hideous and dirty, like a crime scene, yet I don't remember it that way.

I turned on my PC and looked for John on Facebook. After a while, I found him; a family member using his account. John had been dead for ten years. It is absurd; I met him at a conference five years ago; how could I met him if he is dead?



I tried to contact the conference by email, and after giving them my information and everything they required, they responded saying we did not have anyone by that name. I told them that I attended the conference and even gave them the names of some of the attendees. They apologized, ""but you are not in our system,"" they said. I persisted, and they stopped responding.



I also attempted to contact one of John's family members, his sister, through Facebook. I informed her about the conference, and we met there. She stated John was not a scientist. And that he worked at a gas station. That's impossible, I said. I tried to say anything, including his Blackfoot heritage and my dream.

She mentioned that John had blonde hair and blue eyes, and that you should not contact her or any of her family members, She blocked me and called me weirdo!

I noticed their location was in Ohio. What special about Ohio? I thought he was from Arkansas, or whatever.

  


I felt angry and confused, and I told myself I was losing it; I needed to go outside and breathe some fresh air. Or, I will make me some coffee first, I went to the kitchen and pressed the switch and the light didn't turn on, then I pressed the other switch and there was no light, and I found myself in my bed, sleeping.



I woke up and went to the switch to open the light; when I pressed it again, with no response, I found myself back in my bed.

I opened my eyes and woke for the second time from my cursed slumber, and I began to panic. I jumped from my bed again and quickly, rushed to the wicked kitchen, pressed the switch, and found myself back in my own bed.

  


I never went to the kitchen because I feared I would get stuck in a dream loop. But instead, I went to the computer to write about my predicament, and I'm still not sure if I'm sleeping or dreaming an endless dream. I don't know if John, whether the conference or this story are real or not. And I don't know if I wake up again or press the kitchen switch, the story or I will cease to exist, like my conversation with John. If you read this, my or our story, it will only be a part of your imagination, and when you wake up, it may no longer exist.",3,1766342614.0,nosleep,1,0.8,False

Cabo de Gata felt raw and empty once the day visitors disappeared — warm rock, salt in the air, the Mediterranean flat and metallic as the light dropped. No campsite, no facilities, no fire. Just a small, late pitch and the sound of waves hitting the shore.

The night was all wind and stars. The cliffs still holding the heat from the day. One of those places where you don’t need much — just enough to be there.

Woke before anyone else, packed early, coffee with the tide rolling in and first light breaking over the Med. Gone without a trace.

I filmed the whole thing — the approach, the stealth setup, the night, and the early escape — as part of my adventure bike travels. If this kind of low-impact wild camping speaks to you, the full experience is on YouTube (Adventure Bike Chronicles).

▶ to what is your favorite book movie or
▶ book or movie that inspires you um I've
▶ always been a huge fan of the Harry

▶ relate to that a little bit it's it's
▶ all about um you know
▶ overcoming some part of your past that
▶ um that has been very dark for you so
▶ for Harry it was losing his parents um
▶ and and defeating Voldemort and you know
▶ going on this quest for the greater good
▶ um for me you know it's it's overcoming
▶ the abuse that I went through and seeing
▶ how I could make a difference in the
▶ world going forward for the greater good
▶ so um I guess I can I can relate to that
▶ a little

▶ daily routine I get up I get up super
▶ early in the morning I never was a

after writing a lot about other projects and labels... here is a bit of a more personal text, a recap of some projects i did in the last 12 months...

2025 draws to a close, and as I look back at it, what better occasion to write my thoughts down, as I sit in a restaurant, on a bridge, above a river, and eat a how bowl of yellow lentil dahl?  
Cuz, you know, in order to ""bridge"" the transition from one year to the other...  
And as I just burnt my tongue on the still quite hot dahl, maybe my words may be more fluid than usual...

So, one of the highlights for me, this year, was to write 3 books on the techno, hardcore, electronic music, its history, and it's link to the cultural, the political, and the surreal.  
  
**""About Digital Hardcore Recordings - A fan-written guidebook""**

[https://dhrfanbook.blogspot.com/](https://dhrfanbook.blogspot.com/)  
These were a book that lists and gives an in-depth review of all digital hardcore recordings releases.  
A book about the Hamburg label Fischkopf Recordings (that includes short reviews of all tracks on all releases).  
  
**""The Fischkopf Records Guidebook""**

[https://fischkopfrecordsguidebook.blogspot.com/](https://fischkopfrecordsguidebook.blogspot.com/)

And one on the history of doomcore and doom techno.  
Given the reaction to this one (""I never heard the word ""Doomcore"", what does mean?""), it was definitely a first.

It's features and texts had been read by several million people this year, and every major feature was read by at least 20.000-100.000 viewers.  
Of course, the amount of readers does not define the quality of a magazine... but it is nice to know that one is (finally) getting heard.  
  
Also in other ways this was the year the ""mainstream eye"" of society became interested and started to look at our projects. And the ""pure hc scene"" suddenly felt too-small-of-a-pond...

*I was in the car about to park in some plaza when I saw several (maybe four or five) spheres with a thick ring around them floating in the air, they all moved in unison until all of a sudden it became one big one hovering there, and as a I rushed to try to take a photo of it, which I thought I did, I looked at my phone when it started to scramble.*

*All of a sudden, I was jolted awake inside a coffee shop in that plaza, sitting at a table with a notebook in front of me. I knew I had blacked out for a while, and when I woke up in the dream, there was a guy sitting near me and he said that I had been asleep for a while. I was shaking, trying to catch my breath, trying to process what had just happened, as I felt I had been somewhere else against my will. I looked down at my notepad and there were some things written down and from the little that I can remember, on the top right corner there were two lines of four letter sequences, like different codes or something. Then further down the page, there were four lines written out and the only two that I can vaguely remember was talking about if X doesn't happen by X time they need to shift or pivot, and the other was that 'they needed more people.' I wish I could remember the rest but it's like I scanned it once in the dream and then it became fuzzy.*

*As I looked around me, I felt like my senses were heightened and for some reason I was drawn towards this older man that I did not know, and I dropped down near his feet and just threw my head in my hands and wept over what had just happened, I was more shaken even though I had no recollection of what had just happened, and when I woke up for real, tears were coming down my face and I just kept saying out loud 'I want to understand, help me understand.'*

Curious if anyone has any further insight. I clearly came back with 'information' and what happened while I was blacked out is quite literally blacked out of my mind, so I don't know everything that happened, but it seems like I was taken for a while. I'm not sure how this translates to the reality of this happening in our awake dimension beyond the dream dimension, or if it even matters. ",1,1766342317.0,aliensinmydreams,0,1.0,False

1psdksk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1psdksk/denver_edition_avoid_jigsaw_dating_longer_read/,(Denver Edition) Avoid Jigsaw Dating * Longer Read,"TL;DR : (At least for Denver) Jigsaw dating seems to be only interested in getting people's money and cares nothing for you actually finding someone to connect with. Let the company improve or die off (Survival of the fit). They don't care about gender balance, screening people or offer anything unique

Preface

I had never previously tried dating apps or events, although recently I decided to get more out of my comfort zone and try new things. I decided upon an event hosted by ""Jigsaw dating"" through Eventbright. (During the weekday). The event was originally for a Friday and was rescheduled to a Thursday. Going into it, I kept my expectations horribly low to avoid too much disappointment. The event was hosted at a mini-golf spot here in Denver and I arrived 15 mins early.

My experiences

The first event at mini-golf as I arrive early, I see a line of men, no women and a small section for the event. The event lacked any real structure and I ended up chatting with a couple of other guys at the event waiting for women to arrive (30-40 minutes). A few women arrived throughout the event, with most people being confused due to the lack of structure. Speeding through the unimportant details, the event turned out to be still disappointing despite my low expectations.

I gave the company a baseball three strikes (Even a few extra at bats haha). Now I am not without flaws, although I feel I have made a good deal of progress in my life as a person (On several levels), my results: still pretty awful.

Continuation

Each and every event of theirs has had disproportionate gender ratios (more men than women in staggering numbers). The coffee shop speed dating has literally had so many men that we  have to wait in a queue, talk to each other and I ended up not even talking to some of the women based on time constraints.

In my opinion this helps neither men nor women. Firstly, there is no vetting and you have no idea of the kinds of people showing up to these (anyone with $30-40 can attend). Secondly it has to be extremely bombarding and overwhelming to the women, especially the ones who get held hostage at the speed dates in a stationary seat while the staggering amount of men rotate and only 5 minutes to talk. I also feel for the women and share the secondhand let-down, fear, anxiety and disappointment as some of the men attending and that I have interacted with myself seem weird, unkept, not hygienic or look at women like a piece of meat.

Bottom line

The company does a bit of advertising and hosts multiple events each and every week in Denver but does not offer much of value, uniqueness, safety, etc. Please stay away, especially women.",42,1766342229.0,Denver,36,0.84,False
1psdjlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1psdjlj/if_youre_a_brown_muslim_man_especially_south/,"If you're a brown Muslim man, especially south Asian, it is honestly over for you these days","
If you’re a brown Muslim man, especially desi, it feels like you’re held to an insanely high standard just to be considered for marriage. We’re expected to bring everything to the table:
	
•	High-status career (doctor, engineer, lawyer, etc.)
	
•	Huge mahr (I’ve genuinely heard figures like 50k–100k)
	
•	Stability, status, confidence, looks. The full package

Meanwhile, a white man can work at a coffee shop, have tattoos, barely practice, and suddenly all those “standards” get thrown out the window. The mahr becomes flexible, the expectations soften, and excuses start getting made.

What makes it worse is that some of this comes from our own women. Brown men get called “bottom of the barrel,” “ugly,” “short,” or told we have “big egos.” Yet we’re the same ones being told to improve ourselves endlessly just to compete.

It really does start to feel like the “just be white” theory playing out again and again. A brown man has to be exceptional to be noticed, while a white man can be average and still be seen as desirable. In fact, it's not even just white men, if you're anything but a south asian man, you basically have an advantage. 

Again, this isn’t about attacking white men or blaming women, everyone is allowed preferences. But when the pattern keeps repeating, it’s hard not to question why brown Muslim men are judged so harshly, even within their own communities. Especially when racism against us is rampant.

1psdja0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1psdja0/possible_directions_for_a_season_2_part_1/,Possible Directions for a Season 2: Part 1,"Hey Dispatchers, with the AdHoc team rumored to start seriously discussing/drafting a season 2, I wanted to throw my hat in the ring as both a diehard fan and a writer in possible directions season 2 could start with. I see so much rich discussion, awesome fanart, and people making their own stories surrounding the game that I wanted to put some ideas down and get some feedback/discussion. This part 1 post is just my two cents on the characters, the world, and how their arcs could evolve and what they might face as we return to clock back into Torrance. It's long, like light novel long, so feel free to take water breaks during my ramblings.

**TL;DR** because I wouldn't blame you.

1. **Blonde Blazer needs to be the deuteragonist in the next season**. Regardless if you romanced her or Visi, she should take a lot of the narrative focus of the next chapter. If season one was about transformation (Z team turning into real heroes, Robert becoming a mentor), then I think the next season should focus on overcoming stagnation. Mandy should take center stage on this as what happens if Mandy can't go back to being Blonde Blazer in season 2? If the ""deeds make the man/hero"" then where does this leave a good person like Mandy when she can't be a hero? What happens when the perfect representation of the ""golden age of supers"" is stuck with being a dispatcher (a job she sucks at)? Moreover, how does she wrestle with her fears that no one cares who she is behind her superhero mask?
2. Robert's arc in the first season was excellent. As many have pointed out, it's not so much about ""making the man Mecha again"", it was more around “making Mecha Man Robert again"". However, with his suit back and a superhero team he cares about, what happens when he's placed in a similar position as his father was when he founded the Brave Brigades? In line with Robert's contention with his family's (mostly his father's) legacy, if he's given more people to turn into heroes for SDN, how does he wrestle with determining who's worthy of being a hero and who is not? Moreover, what happens when his options might not be the same ""diamonds in the rough"" the first Z team was?
3. **The main villain of Dispatch season 2, at least in my view, shouldn't being another Shroud like villain. I believe that SDN itself should be the primary antagonist and the biggest obstacle for Robert and his team as they navigate season 2**. With Mecha Man restored and back in the best looking suit (don't @ me), SDN has gained more subscribers, attention, funding, and a famous hero to be its poster child for the next events of season 2. What happens when upper management replaces Mandy as the head of the Torrance branch with Mecha Man Blue? Additionally, what happens when they take the phoenix program (which they were on the verge of shutting down before Mandy and Robert started putting in that work) and makes it their ""selling point"" or ""cash cow"" for season 2?

Main Story opening:

**We should open up with Mandy before she got her amulet, how she got it, and a little montage of her becoming an elite hero (beloved hero) around LA.** We should see who she was briefly in LA before she got the amulet and became Blonde Blazer. She could be working for a non-profit organization at the bottom of the food chain as an intern. We can have a short sequence of her setting up meetings, running around Torrance fetching coffee for her bosses/employees, and just doing her job while **just being herself.** She tips the baristas, she holds the door open for people while having her hands full of cups of coffee, and when she heads back and forth, she knows the people at the building ALL by their names, even the janitors. Moreover, she keeps a good attitude when her bosses receive their coffees or paperwork and always forget her name. She keeps a smile and tells them ""My name is Mandy"".  (Overall, just a neat little montage of her working as a intern at one of the lowest positions possible in any job profession. Her past experience can serve as a foundation as to why she's 

1. A Great boss who sees the best in people at SDN. 

2. Explains why she carries a corporate side when at work) 

We continue throughout her day until she gets done with her work and heads home. As she's walking back to her apartment, she happens to stop by a garage sale. She heads over because she sees a Mecha Man figurine (more food for the crowds (me) that have the head canon that she's a big fan of Mecha Man due to him just being a guy in a suit) and then a red glint catches her eye, an amulet. She asks the seller ""how much for the amulet"" since it looks cool if not a little cheesy. The seller just asks for a dollar along with however much she's paying for the figurine. She goes home, and for the giggles, puts on the amulet and BOOM she becomes a superhero. We can then cue her having a long montage of figuring out her powers, working out, helping people, beating villains etc. she does this for a while and gains widespread recognition across LA. We can end the superhero montage with her stopping a bank robbery (or something similar). Later, as the robbers are placed in cuffs, she's asked by a reporter ""Hey Hero! What's your name?"" And she goes on to say ""My name is Man-"" until she catches herself and says ""I'm still working on the name"" and then we end the scene with her being approached by a group of SDN officials.

**Why this type of origin?** Her ""boring"" origin could serve as a twist to people thinking she found the amulet in some ruined temple or being gifted it by aliens who found her ""worthy"". **In reality**, she just happened to find the amulet, puts it on for a laugh, unlocks its power, and just did what she does best, she becomes a hero because **doing good work** is what comes naturally to Mandy.

From my perspective, I think her lackluster origin has been hinted at since the very start of episode one with Mandy telling Robert that she's ""not quite drunk enough to share her origin story just yet"". Which is a funny line, **but there's some nuance nuggets from just that one line with my main question being, Why the hesitancy?** We just had Robert tell Mandy his backstory (something deeply personal, a true superhero origin story about legacy/expectations etc.) but again, she still keeps it to herself out of fear? Out of not knowing him well enough? Or maybe because **her origin isn't really a traditional superhero origin story**. There's no tragedy, legacy, or ""with great power comes great responsibility"" moment for Mandy.

Moreover, if we do go on that date with her, she takes off the amulet expecting Robert to be.....disappointed? I noticed something when replaying this scene where she tells us **""Okay, maybe if I wasn't called Blonde Blazer, maybe I wouldn't be so self-conscious about it"".** Notice how she didn't say ""Okay, maybe if I didn't call myself Blonde Blazer."" Furthermore, she says ""People have expectations and they never meet me first, **it's always the superhero, It's hard to live up to.""** From this info, I think that she never gave herself the name ""Blonde Blazer"" **I think SDN gave her that name when they hired her and they really only saw her as the superhero.....never as Mandy.** Eventually, after becoming a superhero and gaining the recognition, she entered an identity crisis (possible imposter syndrome) that a lot of us noticed her having during season 1 and reading her side story comic. 

She's in an interesting spot because she may not feel that she EARNED the power that the amulet gave her and she might feel as though she wasn’t the right or ""worthy"" person to receive the amulet. Notice how she acts around Robert when he tells her that he's basically flat out broke after keeping the suit up and running after his dad died. She's shocked and genuinely wants to know why Robert would sacrifice everything to still be a superhero to the point of financial ruin. I think she asks him this question not only out of concern for him, but also to reflect on herself. Maybe she joined SDN in the first place in order to get a consistent paycheck? I think there's a juicy section of duality between Robert and Mandy in season 1 that is often overlooked, and I want to see it explored more in season 2. 

**Mandatory HR meeting:**

In true telltale fashion, we need a way for the game to ask you what choices you made during the first season. Moreover, since I hate myself, I will also include the ""bad ending"" for Visi as an option.

We open with Robert, Mandy, Chase, Visi (if you got the good ending), and every Z team member being asked questions by an HR representative on the following Monday after the Shroud Confrontation. I think this serves as a funny way to talk about the shit each person did that FOR SURE would make any HR representative crash out. They would first interview Robert and ask him questions, the first being which ending we got from season one. ""So could you tell us what happened on that rooftop?"" ""We heard the reports but it would be best to get your recollection on the situation"". We can choose the narrative paths for season 2 by either killing/sparing Shroud, if Visi took the bullet for us or slimed out Shroud etc. Then, we move onto them asking ""BTW we heard that you might be in a relationship with one of your coworkers? We just wanted to clear the air here surrounding these rumors"" which then immediately cuts to either Courtney or Mandy depending on who you select for your romance path for season 2.

Overall, I think it’s a good section not only for us fans who want this HR scene for the laughs, but also because it accomplishes asking the player what choices we made in the first season, without having the pre-game default scene by scene questions most Telltale games did in the old days. I think four questions need to be asked for the players. 

1. Which ending did we get? Did we fail as a mentor or not?
2. Who did we romance? Courtney or Mandy? (I'm not considering the chads that didn't romance anyone, don't ask)
3. Who did we cut originally? Sonar or Coupe? (It'll be important for later sections of season 2, more in part 2 of this discussion)
4. Did we kill Shroud or not? (Not too important but I’ll come back to him in part 2 of this discussion)

After grilling Mandy or Courtney (both of them are in the hot seat, ESPECIALLY the purple one for dating her boss. Moreover, Mandy for dating her subordinate). They move onto each Z team member and ask them questions like

""Who broke the vending machine?"" 

""You do know your portals leave scorch marks right?""

""Why are there melon pieces everywhere?""

""You heard WHAT while you were in the bathroom?"" 

""Why did you eat your boss's food?""

""We overheard that you don't wash your hands after using the bathroom?"" 

""Chase, we heard that you use a lot of offensive language to your team members? Care to explain why?"" 

“We might have to put a bell on the invisible one” 

Until finally, the HR rep. steps out and warns Robert at the end of all the meetings that they’ll keep a VERY close eye on this branch but that they pass the inspection.

Robert, surprised, says “Wait, what really?” And the HR rep responds “Hell no, personally I would fire each and everyone of you for somehow breaking every rule in the handbook"" \*takes a deep breath, ""but since you saved this branch and because my bosses want to talk to you, you guys get a pass this ONE time” and Robert goes “Okay, cool, I guess, wait.......who wants to talk to me?” And then he meets the upper management branch of SDN California as they pull him into the meeting room.

They start off the meeting by listing everything that’s happened so far, the destruction of the Torrance branch, the endangerment of the employees, the sheer amount of money that will have to go back in rebuilding, and just when it seems as though they’re going to blame it on Robert and his team, all of them start thanking and praising him for the outstanding performance of the Z team. They tell him that the phoenix program is a huge success and that beating the Red Ring really put the Torrance branch (and by extension the California SDN branch) on the map. Moreover, they’ve tripled in subscribers over the weekend, got more funding, and are looking to expand the phoenix program as the state government of California has provided them funding for their “villain problem” and for an upgraded ""phoenix program"". 

Robert can have multiple choices in how to respond “thank you it was no problem”, “it was all on the team not me” etc. when he gets hit with this from an ex-member of the Brave Brigades whom Robert recognized: “You did such a good job that we’re making you the new head manager and senior dispatcher of the Torrance branch, effective immediately”

Robert: What the fu- 

**cuts to the iconic Dispatch cape** 

After Robert gets over his shock, he immediately asks them “what about Mandy?, she’s the person who got the phoenix program started in the first place. She’s the reason why any of the Z-team members are heroes today.” To which the upper reps tell Robert “Oh we’re not firing her, she’s just going to be dispatching for the foreseeable future. We heard what happened to Chase and we expected nothing less from our Mandy! A true hero through and through!"" ""However, right now we can’t have the branch that defeated the infamous Red Ring and Shroud represented by her in her most...... current state. Optics wouldn’t look too bright. So, who better to lead the branch and the phoenix program than one of LA's most iconic heroes?”

We can get more options in how to respond but for my head-canon, I KNOW Robert wouldn’t stand for it and threatens to quit if they do that to Mandy. To which the ex-Brave Brigade member tells Robert “Look we know tensions are high with this sudden shift, but if you quit right now, we will have to restructure our entire contract with the State. And let me be clear if we weren't already, they don't want Blonde Blazer, they want Mecha Man, the hero who transformed supervillains into superheroes that beat the Red Ring.” “So if we have to restructure our new budget and our contract with the state.....we might have to ask you to pay for the suits repairs, the damage to Torrance due to Shrouds vendetta AGAINST you, and a great deal of many things in order to function properly.” 

Robert stands up about to say something until he's cut off-

""Or...... you can lead this branch with your team? At least until everything settles down and Mandy goes back to being Blonde Blazer?......if that ever happens”

**The Story going forward:**

I think this direction opens a lot of possibilities for our cast, but for this section for part 1 on my post, I mainly want to highlight Robert and the new phoenix program SDN is backing. 

Robert: Now that he’s the reluctant leader of the Torrance branch, senior dispatcher, part time hero, and overseer of the new phoenix program, Robert finds himself in a similar situation that his dad was in when he helped form the Brave Brigade. He faces the burden of responsibility, legacy, and determining who is “worthy” of being on a superhero team through the ""new"" phoenix program. 

A major point of contention between Robert and his father was that in the comics, Robbie was a Tyrant and a straight up ass in his leadership position. Robbie acted like a gatekeeper to the team and stopped Shroud from being a member due to his own personal assessment of him. He used Elliot like a tool, embarrassed him, and beat the crap out of him for having the stones to challenge him. Chase (deservingly) called Robbie out on this behavior and Robbie ultimately died because of it. However, I think it’ll be interesting to see what happens if Robert has to mentor, train, and cut new members of the phoenix program on a bigger scale with a bigger net of characters. Although Robert has shown through the first season to be a better person than his father was as a mentor and a friend so far, what happens when he finds himself in a similar position as his father where he has to assess new heroes?  

I’m going to be honest, I think that the z team in season one were mostly people that yeah, did some minor crimes, (expect Coupe, she was straight up an assassin) but were people that wanted to be better at the very least and wanted to be heroes when they signed up for the program. They had their issues and in the beginning, definitely went about being heroes the wrong way (sabotaging each other as an example). However, with Robert being there to mentor them, they evolved into heroes. They might’ve stumbled here and there, but I believe that each and every one of them at the very least were TRYING to be heroes. However, for the new phoenix program, let’s get some real genuine dirt bags here. Give Robert (and by extension the players) some worse villains. With the state of California giving SDN more funding and because they want to fix their overcrowded prison populations filled with supers, the Torrance branch is going to get dumped with more villains being filtered into the phoenix program.

u/carteradams_ or cargonomics made a really good story following the events of season one of Dispatch. Moreover, I think his “Y-team” or the next set of phoenix team members is a key highlight I want to focus on. In his story, some of them (not all of them) are straight up evil people that find themselves in the phoenix program. I think this a direction worth exploring because it places Robert in a similar position to his father as he has to judge who really wants/gets to be a hero. Throw villains like Toxic or x red ring members in there. Make us, the players, conflicted on if they want to change or if they're just set on being villains. Blur the lines between ""Hey I want to be here to be a hero"" and ""I'm only here because I was forced to."" Throw killers, terrorists, and other cut season 1 concept characters in there for Robert to assess, mentor, and cut. 

End note:

Wow, that was a lot of yapping, and if you're still here, I want to say thank you for taking the time to read this! Originally, I thought I was going to keep this to just a part 1 (the intro and main story beat) and part 2 (each character's arc) while somehow keeping it relatively short and surface level. However, as I put words to paper, I realized that I was VERY wrong. There's a lot that I couldn't include due to length and wanted to flesh each idea out more, but ultimately, I decided that I wanted to sit down and really think about Mandy and Courtney's arcs and how they would evolve with this direction I laid out for my part 2 post. 

  
Firstly, I plan to cover Mandy's arc with her being stuck as Mandy and  a dispatcher. I want to talk about what happens when

1. She comes to the realization that Royd is stuck between a rock and a hard place when he can't feasibly solve Chase's problem with him being so close to death. If he removes the amulet for even a couple of seconds, Chase might die. So how does she feel about being stuck as a normie for a while?

2. To rub even more salt on her wounds, what if Chase with her amulet during season 2, is a ""better"" hero than she was? What if he's faster and stronger than she was with her amulet, further solidifying the idea that she was only a superhero with the amulet and not the other way around? 

3. How does she handle being a dispatcher? While she's a great hero and a good person, how does she become a great mentor? If she can't help but compare herself to Robert during season 1, how will she handle being a dispatcher for the old Z-team during season 2?

This, along with with her romance path, would be some of the things I want to hit in my part 2 post. Additionally, I want to tackle Courtney as well. What happens if we got her bad ending and what would that look like in season 2? Moreover, if we romance her, what that relationship would look like in season 2 and how she plays a big part in it (regardless if we romance her) while giving Mandy the lion's share of being the deuteragonist. 

Please let me know what y'all think!

1psdien,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1psdien/my_hemorrhoidectomy_experience/,My Hemorrhoidectomy Experience,"Hi ya'll, I am a 30 year old male, generally healthy (workout 3x a week) and eat healthy for the most part. I've had noticeable symptoms related to hemorrhoids, which have been progressively worsening for the last 7 years. Last year or so has been especially challenging with bouts of flare ups and spotting on clothes related to bleeding. This is what prompted me to get the surgery on Dec 15th, 2025. I had 2 grade 3-4 internal hemorrhoids which prolapsed daily after bowel movements and practically took the entire day to go back in. Here's my experience and some tips so any of you'll considering / scheduled for this surgery can have a smoother experience.

Pre-op

* 5 days before surgery I stopped taking my vitamins as instructed by the surgeon
* 3 days before surgery I stopped taking my Optifiber (fiber supplement), so as to reduce the bulkiness of my poop. I am a vegetarian Indian male, so switched to white rice + dal (dal chawal) for lunch and dinner. I scrambled eggs cooked in clarified butter (ghee) for breakfast
* 2 days before surgery I started taking Colace (OTC stool softener) 2x daily
* 1 day before surgery only liquid diet (water + lemonade + mirepoix broth) - recommended but not necessary per my doctor.
* 2x dulcolax the night before the surgery + Enema in the morning to clear the bowels (as instructed by the doctor)

1st week

Day 0

* Had anal spasms and possibly the most pain post-op (pain level 3-4) immediately after the surgery.
* Couldn't pee for 4 hrs after the surgery and they excused me without catheterizing since I was dehydrated (160 ml fluids in the bladder as opposed to 300 ml requirement for catheterization). I peed almost instantaneously after reaching home. I think the pressure to pee so they could close up behind me (note it's an outpatient surgery here in the US and they are going to be hustling you so that they can discharge you) was another reason I couldn't pee in the first place.
* I tried to do a pure liquid until my first bowel movement fearing constipation + pain, but that was the wrong call. It's important to have some solid food inside to counteract the effect of painkillers (tramadol in my case). I briefly lost consciousness and fell on my face while walking back from the restroom at home, please don't make the same mistake and have someone with you for all restroom runs for the first day or two.
* Avg Pain Rating - 2

Day 1

* Switched to boiled rice + yogurt blended in a blender for all feedings (4x a day, preceding the tramadol routine, once every 6 hrs).
* Also had Colace (stool softener) 2x a day)
* Felt like pooping but only the gauze packing came out, no pain though. Took a shower.
* Did not poop on day 1, so had 1 dulcolax (laxative) at the end of day.
* Avg Pain Rating - 2 (on the evening of day 1, I had a brief spike in pain which topped off at a 3-4)

Day 2

* First poop, no pain at all came out liquidy. Can't emphasize the importance of dietary discipline + taking Colace (2x per day) 3 days before the surgery to regulate the consistency of your poop. In fact I pooped twice on the day and had no pain at all. There was significant bleeding with the first poop so don't worry.
* Continued Tramadol, Colace and blended boiled rice + yogurt meals 4x a day.
* Also had Pear + Apple juice (from concentrate) which are known to be high in sorbitol that acts as a natural stool softener.
* Avg Pain Rating - 2

Day 3

* Did not poop again, so had dulcolax at the end of the day
* Continued the same med + feed routine
* Avg Pain Rating - 1

Day 4

* Pooped according to schedule + started delaying pain meds (stretched to 8 hrs instead of 6 hrs)
* Started eating slightly more solid food (scrambled eggs, sourdough bread, milk etc)

Day 5

* Pain is almost non-existent, just soreness while stretching / attempting to walk
* Was even able to put some weight on my butt, do fairly long car rides (40 mins long)
* Started having coffee, scones etc. still fairly low residue food
* Discontinued tramadol

Day 6 (today)

* Soreness still exists but pain is non-existent

Pain Management tips

* Keep poop soft and avoid constipation, I had slightly hard poop on day 4 and could definitely see how that could cause a lot of pain / discomfort if it were to occur on day 2-3.
* Don't sit on your butt on or for a few days after your surgery
* Get long term nerve pain block (Exparel) injection. I made sure my doctor gave it to me post surgery and I feel like there might some correlation to the minimal pain I experienced.

Anxiety Management

* If any of you'll are hypochondriacs like me, I'd highly recommend against watching too many youtube videos with horror experiences. Just read this thread and the other references I've linked below. Unless you're unlucky and have an outlier experience (have surgery close to the dentate line or are uncharacteristically prone to constipation despite taking all the right steps), this surgery is supposed to be mostly uncomfortable not very painful. You've got this, you can do it and will come out as a better person on the other side !

1psdi94,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1psdi94/visiting_planet_willow/,Visiting Planet Willow!,"Here is another quick journal entry. I'm writing this as soon as I woke up while everything is still fresh in memory. This post marks journal log #3. And this time, this entry is a successful astral projection rather than a failed attempt! If you're interested in my previous entry feel free to click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1pok8w3/journal_entry_2_a_plateaustalemate/) (though that one was a failed attempt).

Last night before sleeping I told myself I would astral project.

I failed. Then I did the WBTB method, and right before losing consciousness and entering sleep I visualized and told myself, ""When I wake up, I'm already astral projecting.""

I did wake up. I woke up in my astral body and I found myself in a park. My consciousness felt equal that of being awake, but there were moments where it wavered into a hazy/sleepy, almost dream-like state. I found myself floating above a park and beneath me there was a small hill with trees and what looked like a moat or water surrounding it. I remember seeing a lot of thick grass like if the landscape hadn't been mowed in over a month. The environment took place during night-time. And I looked at the grass, it was wet so I assume it had rained recently. (Weirdly, this is now the second time I've found myself waking up in my astral body in an environment around wet grass.)

Then, very briefly I lost consciousness beside the hill. But afterward when I regained consciousness I flew across the park and began flying further up into the air. Somewhere in this park complex there was an old man, and somehow he was able to see me! At first, he thought I was a bird, then he asked me directly if I was Jesus because I was hovering in the air. I didn't respond, instead I continued flying. Telepathically, he felt convinced he was just seeing things because it was late at night and he was very tired. I had the idea that I didn't outright look like a floating person to him, but rather a dim apparition.

I flew higher into the sky until I was in orbit of our planet, I imagined myself slowly turning into a ball of light. Then, I had the idea of exploring a random planet! I wanted to visit a planet, one unique but with life on it. Then all of the sudden, my vision locked onto a coordinate in the inky blackness of space, then I began traveling there faster and faster. At some point I briefly lost consciousness.

Then, I found myself in orbit of a planetary system. I had a sense that this system contains one dim white star, one habitable world, and four other rocky but lifeless planets. The habitable world was the closest planet to the star and I decided to move closer to it.

As I got closer I also got the idea of the planet's name, as if a voice, one that felt like my own told me this planet was called or at least best described as, ""Planet Willow.""

I descended to the surface of Planet Willow. I detected no intelligent or sentient life, however what I saw was an alien forest of giant trees that looked like massive willow and lily flowers. Somehow, I also had the premonition that these flower-like trees were desperate for light, so they had adapted to grow very tall. Their purple petals moved as the sun traveled above the horizon, similar to how sunflowers track sunlight. Telepathically, as if I were the flower-like trees themselves I could just feel how important the sunlight was to these plants, and how desperate they were for it.

The same intuition also told me that the planet's orbital cycle was fast, much quicker than an Earth day. The planet itself felt smaller than Earth, with less gravity. And if I had to guess it was probably around the size of Mars.

I walked and hovered around in my astral body searching for other lifeforms. I didn't find any animals. All I saw were plants. The same willow/lily flowers, smaller purple/white flowers that looked like shrubs, and vines stretched across the planet's surface. I also came across a river about the length of about two people but there was no aquatic life, but it did harbor strange purple algae.

I watched the planet's sun rise over the horizon. A magnificient blue hue burned into my vision. It was... Beautiful, alien in a way I know that I could never witness a view like this on Earth.

Then I felt an inner call telling me it was time to go. I didn't resist.

I hovered upward, slowly leaving the planet's orbit. My awareness then locked onto a coordinate in the sky, and I just knew that coordinate was Earth. But before leaving, I asked a question directed outward to anyone, ""Where is this planet in space? Will anyone discover this planet someday?""

The answer I recieved weren't in words, but telepathic vision. So what follows is just a rough translation:

""The planet is in another galaxy. It is a small, cluster-like galaxy located a few million light years from Earth. Someone will discover it someday."" The vision showed me an astrophysicist, a man of Estonian origin discovering the system through spectral (light/wavelength) or star/planetary transit analysis. I saw a fair-skinned man with brown hair and glasses sitting in a cafeteria, typing a report on a computer. He seemed half-interested, half-bored. On his screen, I saw him write something along the lines of ""potentially habitable world."" I felt that he would never truly realize that this planet actually hosted life.

Then the vision was gone, and I snapped back to space, eyes still locked into the coordinates of Earth. I began traveling towards Earth and eventually lost consciousness.

I woke up in my bed with my head faintly buzzing, and weirdly energized as if I had drank a cup of coffee after a good night's rest. And now, as I type this journal entry to you, I could still feel traces of Planet Willow still lingering in my consciousness.",3,1766342060.0,AstralProjection,2,1.0,False

The effect lasts exactly 23 minutes and can't be stacked or reapplied to the same item until the cooldown ends. Doesn't work on mixed substances (e.g., ""all spicy food"" is too broad; it must be ""jalapeños"" or ""Sriracha sauce""). Doesn't remove nutritional effects—just taste.

The crowd parts around me, tramping home to family, to pets, to HearthWarmed™ apartments, to the soft, forgiving lighting of the holidays, but I'm there, alone, frozen, caught by him.

Again.

***

London: December evening, skies flaking down grey, angry, judging, and my own unit is dark, cold, lonely and so he catches my attention. Again. I stop, stand, stare. 

Coat: threadbare, wind-pierced, but I'll be fine. When I walk I'll warm up. I can mind a moment. I've got a coffee.

Him: him.

I let myself daydream, traipsing through the hazy warmth of what-ifs, casting him centerstage as I spool out potential futures. 

***

This time it's winter and we sit in my living room, comfortably close, laughing, debating ornament types. “We had this wooden set when I was a kid,” I offer, shyly quiet, and he sits, listening patiently. I blush, continue. “My father bought it, right after they divorced. The twelve days of Christmas.”

 I glance at him and he's smiling, head tilted to one side, waiting for the story's end. My words drop to a mumble. 

“We would sing each verse as we hung each one…” My conclusion dwindles to uncertain silence and then I hear his tenor, barely a whisper, as he gives my hand a squeeze and begins: “On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me…”

I feel the electric flush of being weak, small, ignored and then suddenly noticed. A beautiful ache tickles my skin.

Together for our first Christmas.

***

The scene shifts to my dining room now, furniture upscaled and festooned with festive decorations - the theme is wooden, elegant, sparkling. We're richer, happier, healthier, older, a supreme of superlatives. Somewhere offscreen the doorbell rings and then a crowd of guests come in, laughing, hugging, chattering, women I long to befriend now socializing breezily with us.

And their words are genuine, their smiles genuine, their stares genuine - everything, for once, genuine. I can be myself. We've built a family.

I feel a buzzing warmth, guthappy and aspirational, like a slug of wine taking root.

A loving crowd for Christmas.

***

We're old, now, him helping me as I totter to the bedroom. My hair is grey, but I'm elegant, poised, dignified, a regal queen, and my world matches: there's a magnificent four poster bed, silk curtains, crown molding, a room from a fairy tale. 

Mine. 

With him.

And he smiles at me, adoring, loving, kind, protective. 

I feel a detached calm, peaceful and resigned - with him at my side, death would be welcome. Another grand adventure to take together.

Never alone for Christmas.

***

I shiver, but not from the cold, and square my shoulders, vision focusing as the glass window resolves back into view, and I study him through the frosted pane. Nobody should be alone for Christmas.

I ping my assistant to run some numbers then flush in excitement as the result flashes before me. I can finally swing it. Barely. On a payment plan.

My body is tired, tired of always window-shopping and going home by myself. Nobody should be alone for Christmas. I enter the store and signal to the system that I'm a buyer, indicate his model, pick all the upgrades, bells, whistles. I customize his features, adjust his personality and select immediate delivery.

It’s not cheap, but it's worth it because nobody should be alone for Christmas.

Si Brother in Law nag labas ng phone and sinabi na tatawagan nga nanay namin, at sasabihin na andun nga si guy ipapaalam na may nanliligaw na sakin. Pinipigilan namin siya ako isa ko pang ate and asawa niya, saying na wag na at hayaan na ako nalang mag sabi humahanap lang ng tamang timing pero hindi talaga nag papigil hanggang sa sinagot na nung nanay ko yung call at take note VC pa ang ginawa nila.

Nag sasabihan na kami ng sister ko kung pano nanaman magagalit samin nanay ko na mumura murahin kami ng sobra sobra. Until sinabi ng kapatid ko na labasin ko yung manliligaw ko at wag ko iwan.

1psd9pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1psd9pd/absolutely_not_judging_or_being_rude_about/,Absolutely not judging or being rude about anyone’s neurodivergence,"Will try to keep this brief (!)

Husband is (I believe) non dx AuDHD and I truly believe he’s not doing any of this out of spite or on purpose 

Various issues in our 10 year marriage 

\-I believe withholding s\*x as punishment - I rejected him once towards the start because I was crying on the sofa over my dad’s illness, asked for a hug, he came to give me a hug but put a hand on each b00b and lightly squeezed and said honk honk in a silly voice. I pushed him away because I was so confused. He stomped off and every time afterwards I tried to initiate he’d push me away with a ‘well YOU pushed ME away’. 

Since then if he saw me playing with myself he’d say I was obsessed or not normal (I mean it was max 1x a day at bedtime) I started hiding doing it. He was going into a depression then so had no interest anyway. 

Previously he’d blamed our s\*xual issues on me. He was VERY inexperienced and I believe a virgin when we met while I’d had lots of partners. He’s fetishised pvc and latex and snipes at my fashion choices because I wear normal clothes for a 42 year old woman living in a small town with no s\*x clubs nearby, who doesn’t go clubbing and an exciting day out is going for a coffee 

\- I’m disabled now so he’s thrown at me that I’m a burden (I don’t mention how he was a financial burden to me for 6-8 years when he refused to work for various excuses and I paid for everything from my parents inheritance). 

As part of the disabled bit. I’ve fought from having to be pushed everywhere in a wheelchair to walking with a stick and able to drive again. However I do have to be pushed in a wheelchair through airports due to the noise and distance and speed 

In Florida last month we’d checked in and I’d got in the wheelchair (he always pushes to free up staff). On way to security i glimpsed the toilets and said after security can I go to the toilet please. I hate security and always get anxious and try to get through it asap. I was also conscious there was a lot of people about to check in and head to security. He whirls the chair round and heads to toilet. I kept saying no I don’t want it just now and he kept going. He basically forced me (not by holding me but taking me to them and not listening) to pee. After security I said ‘please don’t do that again i didn’t want to go straight away’. He huffs, says fine I won’t take you on holiday again (as in escort me, I pay). He storms off, cools down and is nice as pie while I’m almost in shock because there’s a big change in his personality. If I try to discuss it he says it’s fine whereas I’m still upset.

Spoke to counselling when we got back, she admonishes him and then an hour later we go for a coffee and when I order asks ‘is that wise’ like I’m a mentally backward person (and I’ve been checked out for mental cognition so i could have power of attorney removed.

\-that same trip I’m quiet in the cafe and as soon as he’s finished his cake I take his plate and put it on mine - mainly busy work so I don’t have to talk but also I worked in hospitality and try to be kind.

That day he preps me a stew (I’ve never mastered cooking) he’s in the open plan kitchen chopping veg. I walk past him intending to take out a big bulky piece of cardboard. I see he has two full food recycling bags tied and he’s working on a third. So I don’t say anything i just pick them up and take them to the bin since I’m going anyway. He roars at me a little later that me taking them was a dig (i didn’t say a word) and that I was OCD as shown with stacking plates earlier.

\- he’s forever calling me mentally ill, Abnormal, Not Normal. If I say oh that hurts he brushes it off as in oh it’s just something said in an argument but there’s no apology or change and to the point I actually feel panicky at the word Normal and if I say it in conversation tears come to my eyes. Now a few times I’ve said nicely ‘look you need assessed for AuDHD, I think you’re autistic etc’ he says I’m calling him names. I explain it’s like saying to someone you have a lump ie it’s identifying a medical type issue but he won’t understand it 

\- he always tells me how much hard work I am, that I’m crap at xyz (I believe to make me feel crappy because I’m getting better and I push myself and I believe in growing as a person 

\- odd one. So he drinks a lot of cola, like litres a day. He takes up his juice and doesn’t bring the empty bottle down when he finishes it. They usually litter the floor of his room until close to plastic recycling day when he takes down a bin bag full. I only found this out because we have a small tin/plastic recycling tub in the kitchen and it goes out when it’s full. So I’ve said look every time you finish it should go in the bin, it’s rubbish, rubbish doesn’t live in a house it lives in the bin (or intermediate bin). I don’t insist on it going out in peeing rain but it seems crazy to me to fight past a bag of empty bottles to get to xyz. Yet I tried again to say this today and HE WONT DO IT JUST BECAUSE I WANT HIM TO 

\-I try to speak calmly but he always gets so defensive - like if i genuinely ask him if he wants to stay married he says I’m manipulating him when i genuinely want to know if there’s much point. Meanwhile we fight over text and he says oh I’ve just enough in my bank I’ll get a hotel room tonight. I usually beg for him to stay.

So last night we’d been arguing over text (he’d been at work) so he again says I’m debating whether to stay out or come home. So based on his previous messages I think he’s trying to get me to beg him to come back instead of stay in a hotel. Instead I said look you doing and saying that is manipulation 

He then reverts back to it’s not i didn’t know if I should go to the shops or not (no mention of that at all) acting all angelic.

I’m his first girlfriend whereas I’ve dated plenty beforehand. He watches a lot of tv and movies (his autism fixation) and I think he sees stuff on tv and thinks oh that’s normal - like we live in Scotland and if I say something he goats ‘stop being on my Ass’ instead of arse like everyone here says (he says it with an accent too)

I’m just wondering if this is a lost cause 🤷‍♀️ I don’t want my life to continue like this - I’m a generally happy upbeat person, I try to help and give of myself but he’s forever negative, nothing positive to say..

For example I was pushing him to learn to drive for years, he wanted to do film work but always said oh I can’t get there. My mum even offered to buy him a car if he got his license. 

My license was manual so could drive automatic too, I decided to change to an automatic because I drove a lot and he threw at me ‘I don’t want to drive an automatic what if I want to drive it’. It’s just so so exhausting trying to prepare for all these things and excuses and arguments especially when my condition is neurological so I deal with a lot of fatigue just dealing with myself.

He always says he wants to write screenplays, he takes his laptop on holiday and does no writing. It’s gotten so I’ve actually thought what I’ve gone through and come out of could make a good book but if I do start writing he’ll say ‘but I want to write’ and god forbid i succeed.

1psd7fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1psd7fo/holidazed/,Holi(d)azed,"Hi D, 

    I didn't start the tpb yet. I have thumbed through it since your guy was illustrations. They look great and i'm looking forward to it when life slows down a bit. This week has been a bit crazy, and this morning is no different. I woke up late (Bub graciously gave me till 09:30 before bringing out teeth, lol.) I spilled coffee in bed on myself, my mattress protector, the sheet, and the comforter. I'm in the bathtub right now because I don't have hot water. I have lukewarm, and it's less of a shock to my system to just have one consistent shitty temp than do the cold/kinda warm/back to cold dance. 

I have had a lot of really nice human interactions recently. I located a bath bench for a family who couldn't afford one and when I told them it was 100% free the daughter about cried. The little thrift store that gave it to me goes on a holiday break around this time of year and the volunteer there gave me a card with her personal number in case I needed anything for another patient while they're on vacation. Can you believe that? How incredibly kind of them. 

I got assigned the spouse of a former patient of mine and apparently I'm the only one who's been able to convince him to shower. The wife about cried when she realized we were done already. That makes me sad for him but also proud/confident in my interpersonal skills. It's so nice to see both of them again. She's asked if I'd consider doing private work once service stops, and I'm thinking about it. I'm convinced Autistics and Germans are fluent in each other's social language. They're consistently my favorite clients to care for/work with. 

I don't particularly want to be involved in private care at all, but there's a bit of a situation there. I had a patient who took VERY good care of me, despite my protests. He was EOL. I knew what he was saying without him saying it. It was as much a ""thank you for what you do"" as it was a ""please look out for my wife."" I was thinking seriously about stopping private care at the new year because it's about 80 miles round trip. I charge $20/hr, but between the mileage and travel time (about an hour and a half) I'm really not making anything and I'm putting wear and tear on my vehicle while increasing what insurance costs. 

As I'm thinking this, the most beautiful cardinal lands on the branch in front of my window and stares directly at me. I know it's her husband cause he's staring a hole through my head. He stayed for several minutes watching me do my client's dishes. ""Alright, alright, I know, damn it."" I asked God for help knowing what to do because I don't mind donating my time if I break even. The problem is the excessive amount of miles I do in a year has really increased my auto insurance premium. 

Enter the Germans. They're on the way to the other woman. If I can get them to schedule on the same days then I'd be clearing a profit to put back towards insurance. Then came a text from my former patient in another on-the-way town. She'd getting out of rehab soon, coming home, and will need assistance. Doing those three in one day in the same relative area makes sense financially and would be doing a lot of good for some folks who need it. I think I've gotten my answer. 

God really does work in some mysterious ways. I have a very busy day ahead of me. I have to do laundry (bedding, work clothes, pj's,) put together a cat tree, vacuum, do dishes if I ever get hot water today, close out work notes, call patients, set up my auto loan payments, pay rent, clean litter boxes, etc. Then if I have any time left over I have a few ornaments I'd like to make. 

I think I'm gonna pick up some pre-made cookie dough (the silly printed ones) and make a day of it. Get some Burl Ives and Vince Guaraldi going. But first I have to get out of this tub before I turn into a Shel Silverstein poem. ""There's a Polar bear in my Fridg-i-daire. He likes it cause it's cold in there."" 

I miss you. I love you. I've been trying to take better care of myself, thinking of you and your overnight oats. I loved seeing those posts. I knew how badly you felt but every one of those little Mason jars said ""fuck you depression, I'm still here. I'm still trying."" You were, and always will be, a badass in my mind. So when I fill my pill sorter it's every bit a protest as it is self-care. Drinking my (absolutely fucking foul) clearance Metamucil is not elderly, it's punk as fuck. It says ""I'm here. I'm trying."" But I'd like to take a sharp stick to whoever decided we needed fizzy fiber. I don't waste things so I'll finish it but dear lord I gag each time. Anyway, love you, I'm turning blue.

The first draft of this took me 7 hours. The second book, I ended up having an emergency, so it’s been a week since I listened to it. It’s not going to be as detailed because of this. I am currently listening to the third book while writing this. Please forgive me and add anything I’ve forgotten.

Book One

Chatwins: Martin, the oldest, Helen, Rupert, Fiona, and Jane.

Main Characters;
They are different from the show; here are the differences.

Quentin Coldwater - Tall, lanky, and less shy, and not really a dork. Sassy but still scared of the world. He is constantly called a coward and accepts that as reality. He hates himself, his life, and is never satisfied. Ever. You constantly hear “This is what I’ve been waiting for, this is what solves all my problems, and everything will be grand” in both book one and book two.

Alice Quinn - Kind to a fault, mousy and brave to a fault.

Eliot Waugh - Physically different, Eliot has a twisted jaw, which only adds to his charm. The genius of the group. Doesn’t even have to study. He’s not as talkative. None of them are, except Q. Small tidbit, Eliot goes through men every week. At one point, Q gets jealous and afraid that he’s one of those because after the first encounter, Eliot ignores him the rest of the first year. Q really likes Eliot, but it’s never said in a sexual manner; Q is straight.

Janet Pluenski - She is sassy, not mean.

Josh Hubberman - if his last name was mentioned, and it’s different, I didn’t catch it. Extremely observant, not funny, and academically, he’s barely passing. Although once he understands something, he’s a master at it. Something both Q and Janet point out in the series.

Penny - White, like all the characters, has a real name, William; no last name is given to us. He is the nerd that Q is on the show. He is nothing like Penny Adiyodi. He’s introverted, a genius, and a full-blown nerd. Dresses in all punk.

Julia Wicker - This is a hard one to describe. Her personality is very similar to the show, but her reactions and events are different. She ends up going completely gothic, and she ends up gaining a disorder that’s similar to depression.

The magic - It’s slightly different, by means, it’s a lot more flashy than the show (Money is probably why we didn’t get the flashy version on the show.) You can do more, and you can create your own spells.

The world - There's a magic council and rules that aren’t actually mentioned in the show, but are mentioned many times throughout the trilogy. There are many schools like Brakebills.

Q grew up with Julia and James. They tested well together and were always placed together. James and Q’s last names would match up, which he didn’t like. Q was in ‘love’ with Julia. Everyone knew. Julia was dating James at the beginning of Book One.

17 Yrs Old: The Princeton interview consisted of all three discovering the body. Q was giving the 5th book of Fillory and Further by discovery. Jane was the hot paramedic.

Q ends up going through a fence, and on the otherside is Brakebills. He is ushered to the testing room and begins his test. Q thought he saw Julia, but wasn’t sure. The show shows snippets of the book's events, like the card castle.

Alice comes to Brakebills on her own because she desperately wants to learn magic and get away from her parents. (Last part is assumed.)

The first year, Q, Alice, and Penny are hard at work trying to ensure they stay there. They are given many tests to prove their standing at Brakebills. They end up becoming the cream of the crop, so they are constantly around each other studying. Eventually, they exclude Penny from the study sessions, right in front of him. Penny saw them as friends; they didn’t, just to each other (Q & A). They don’t even do it on purpose. When Penny fails the final exam for the semester, no one even talks to him. Penny loses it and punches Q. They end up in a big brawl, lots of punching and grappling on both sides. Q hates Penny after this, and it never lets up. Afterwards, they go home for the summer. Q goes home to his mom and dad (who are married), only to be actively avoided by them. He mentions that this is just life.

In their second year, they are tested for their quirks/discipline. Q is unknown, so he’s placed in the physical cottage. Eliot, Janet, and Josh are physical kids. The discipline is rare, so there’s only a literal handful of people. Q and Alice have to find their way into the cottage and burn the door down with Alice's light-bending powers because Q is a nothingmancer.

Q was bored in class and decided to pull a prank. He jinxes the space the teacher occupied. Things go very wrong very quickly. Because of a spell gone wrong, the beast was able to come through. He froze the entire room and spent HOURS exploring it. The beast never speaks, only sings a tune. The beast has a leafy branch obscuring its face and has three or four extra digits on each hand. Amanda Orloff, an unknown classmate, somehow breaks free from the spell. Before she can fire off a battle magic spell, he eats her whole. Eventually, when day becomes night, the Beast just leaves. The entire staff floods the room after not being able to all day. Dean Fog told the students it was a Lovecraftian monstrosity from another dimension.

The entire school becomes terrified and depressed. Some even left the school in fear. To help bring purpose and order back to the school, Dean Fog decides to continue the Welters game. This is based on houses, so Q, Eliot, Janet, Alice, and Josh become the physical kids on Welters' team. They absolutely smash at it. Although Josh dips in an important game, gets drunk, and confesses he’s insecure about his ability to stay at this school. The Welters' matches last the entire school year they are there, just like football. They also play Push in their free time, all the students.

I’d like to note that there are no drugs on the campus, just alcohol.

One day at the cottage, they are telling stories, and Janet pipes in that she’s got a juicy one. One about Emily Greenstreet. The events unfold just like in the series. The only difference is that Janet mentions ‘the boy’ - Charlie - having been in love with Emily. Afterwards, Alice is furious, as this becomes a huge shock to her. She confesses to Q that Janet was speaking about her brother, who died. Dean Fog, because of what happened, refused to let Alice in. While speaking to Q, Alice is convinced Janet did it on purpose, knowing who he was to Alice. She mentions that Janet is so in love with Eliot, and he couldn't care less, so she's jealous of Alice and Q.

Breakbills south, year three or four (I say this because in one book they only did four years, while in the third book Plum mentions being a fifth-year student). There's no big test dished out by the upperclassmen that dictates your stay. All the students we all know and love attended (except Penny), and they were all turned into geese by a teacher who said an incantation. No secrets here. They are 'rendered mute' as Mayakovsky says for a short time. They spend a year doing constant magic in constantly different conditions and circumstances. They also do some darker shit outside of just mind control. Everyone also spends a massive amount of time turning into animals and having orgies, like a lot. Most importantly, there's a huge exam you can opt in on where you have to trek miles in Antarctica naked. Alice and Q are the only ones who do. Alice not only finishes days before Q, but she does it all without the warmth spell provided by Mayakovsky. (The one with animal fat that Julia used in season one.)

During his time during summer break, just before he goes in for his final year. Julia confronts him, and she gets him to admit that magic is real. This causes her to finally believe in herself. She does a spell that causes rainbow sparks to come out of her fingers. Q tells her that if they didn’t accept her before, they wouldn’t now. However, he leaves, promising Julia he will tell the Dean. He never does.

Janet, Eliot, and Josh graduate and are gifted a key and a cacodemon. Janet, Eliot, and Josh graduate a year before Q and A. When they leave, Q and A are left alone at school for a year. They stick to each other. They don't bother making friends with others or even the new physical kids. They host the entrance party for getting into the cottage, and that’s literally it. They even mention that they probably look like total snobs; they are.
During summer break, Q decides to go with Alice because he is actively avoiding Julia, since his parents always avoid him. He figured it would be better to go with his girlfriend to see her parents. He gets firsthand experience that her parents are overtly toxic, and he is grateful that his is covertly toxic. Alice explains that after Brakebills, there's no direction in life. Most magicians are bored with life, and since they practically are mini-gods, there's nothing really to do. (A big clue to this is that her father grows bored frequently and will change the house so much. Like one time they slept in mud huts.) She has Q promise her that they won't be like her parents. Who actively hate each other but stay because life is bleak and boring? He promises.

Age 21-22: The moment Q and A graduate, Janet, Eliot, and Josh come back for them, and they all live in an apartment until Q and A branch off into their own apartment. A man named Richard is living with the three. We have no idea why or how he came to be. He is a Brakebills graduate and a couple of years older. It's perceived that he is older than Emily Greenstreet.

Every day, everyone except Alice goes out to parties and is on heavy drugs. Alice, however, is diligent in creating a magical project, a thesis if you will. This goes on for months, gets up, hates life, does hard drugs, flirts the night away, comes home to Alice, and they make love, and then the day repeats. One night after a friend gathering at Eliot's, Q decides he’s going to ‘take Janet's clothes off by the end of the night’. Q and Janet hook up later that night. Later, he claims he did it because he was drunk, not because he was desperate to feel something. Alice was there when he woke. He stayed, pretending to sleep for what he figures is 3 hours. When he finally does get up, someone is at the door.

Finally, we get someone else's POV besides Q’s. Penny dropped out when Brakebills had nothing else to offer in the way of education. After he failed the first year, he studied on his own again. When they tested for disciplines, he was marked as an inter-dimensional traveler. The reveal of his discipline comes later in the second or third book. He then began studying under our dear Professor Sunderland, whom he refers to by first name rather than last. During this time of studying under Professor Sunderland, he discovers the Netherlands. Penny goes in and out of the Netherlands for YEARS. He's technically much older than any of them because of how time moves differently. He spends years in there and pops back out for a little while in the real world, wash, rinse, repeat. This goes on for the rest of his time there. He had also become a prefect like Alice. He moved to a small town and was content with being alone. As he always had been. Yet he was lonely. Setting aside his own magical studies, he decides to go somewhere. This leads him to the weird magic dealer at Brakebills. This man is going crazy, convinced that something is after him. He's convinced it's to do with these five buttons. So he sells them to Penny, who is immensely interested. He ‘can feel the magic coming off' it. (A not-so-direct quote of Katie's mom,)

This 15-hour audio finally brings in some action and adventure after 10 entire hours.  When Q opens the door, Penny becomes unstoppable. He goes full-on Show Q Fan Boy. He tells Q that he's convinced this will take them to the Netherlands, which would take them to Fillory. The buttons he knew were Chatwin's mystery buttons, which Helen hid in the last book. The previous book ended with Jane searching everywhere for those buttons. Q fights him left and right, not believing him. Really, Q just hated Penny and didn’t like that he was having access to Q’s dream. Alice called Q a coward, grabbed Q's hand along with Penny, and they all traveled to the Netherlands. This is where Q gets his ass beaten by Alice. Solid black eye and a few bruises. Threatens to end his life, all while Penny finds the fountain. They go back to Earth.

Later in the day, Josh brought a woman over, a French magician named Anais. They all dip in and out of the Netherlands in pairs. Alice then has sex with Penny. Q goes from a total I hate myself and what I've done spiral to I hate Alice and Penny for doing this massive betrayal, and now he's totally excused from what he did because he was drunk. Then they finally decide to venture into Fillory and become kings and queens. They figured it was safer to gain more defensive knowledge in case they ran into trouble, rather than bring guns. So Penny and Alice create battle magic spells.
Fillory, they go, with Richard and Anais in tow. Janet ends up getting really sick in the Netherlands. Someone said it was like she was allergic to it. The Netherlands is like a chessboard maze. Complete with buildings and in those buildings, they note bookshelves.

Before they arrive in Fillory, Alice confronts Q and tells him, point-blank, that nothing in this universe could make him happy. It never did in their world, even after he got everything he wanted, and she's right. Q refuses to believe this and convinces himself that Fillory was the solution to all his problems and that once he was there, somehow it would work out (Almost his words. Paraphrasing here. This is constant throughout book one and two.) Yet the moment they touch ground, he is Fillory's biggest hater. He hates everything and only wants to fight Pennny, so he takes it out on everything.

They quickly realize Fillory is not a fun place to be. Q gets shot with an arrow by the first person/animal they met. (It was a giant humanoid-sized bug) The talking animals are abundant in the part of Fillory they've landed in, very far from the Capital. After that incident with the carriage, they basically look in every corner of the forest for someone to bestow them a quest. Literally no objections from anyone. They all looked high and low. Josh even begged a bird.

They stumble upon a nymph whom Q thought was a dead teen, no older than 16. Q goes into detail about the corpse's naked body and breasts. (Which was unsettling for me.)  When she floats above the water's surface, Penny kneels in front of her, arms spread wide, in full-on Show Q Fan Boy, and asks what the quest is that she's bestowing upon them. Spoiler, nothing. She tells them Fillory isn't like it seems, and if they ever get into trouble, they can blow on this horn. Q takes the horn in gratitude.

They end up at Humbledrum by following a literal walking tree. Q decides he’s not going to allow Penny to ruin his time in Fillory and talks to the bear. Q is ruining it for himself and everyone else. They find out that the 'Silver Years', the years of the Chatwins, were the only peaceful years they've had. Ever since, they've been under cruel rulers. They were now in a civil war. We get no details on who the factions/rulers/leaders are. Penny goes full-on Show Q Fan Boy, trying to ask the bear questions, but Q immediately sours and sours everything around him. Leaving it awkward and harsh. Surprise.

There was a conversation I didn’t catch while listening. They find out that only people from Earth can be kings and queens of Fillory. Once the animals realized they wanted to be kings and queens, they provided two guards to keep them safe on their journey to the crowns, if they made it. One of them was a woman named Fen. A martial arts magician who specialized in a particular fighting style. Holding blades. In Q's eyes, she was a lesbian, as she looked ‘butch’. The other guard is a man with a specialty in battle magic.

They go out on the self-appointed quest to Ember's tomb. Along the way, they have their first real battle. Two talking animals come into focus, and the two battle mages begin. Everyone else freezes. Only Anais jumps into the action. When the battle is over, and one of the survivors pursues Alice, she releases her cacodemon on the enemy. Q admits he's a coward and says he'll never get into a physical altercation. That quickly changed when they got to a building, opened the door, and bam, an elf was after him. Q did take him down, Fen dies, and Janet brought a gun. Someone asks why Janet didn't release her cacodemon, and she says she felt bad for it being inside her, so she released it a long time ago. Sometime shortly after this, the male mage and Anais hook up. Josh doesn’t seem to care.
Embers Tomb. Ember has all-seeing, sentient God vibes. They ask why Ember isn't doing anything about the civil war, and Ember says he can't interfere. Q gets pissed and fed up with Ember and the whole situation. Thinks he can save everyone and blows the horn. Cause that's what it's for, right? Wrong. Out pops the Beast, aka Martin Chatwin. He takes down Ember with total ease. Martin says he has been looking everywhere for those buttons. There's a big standstill, and while Q debates what to do, Penny leaps into action. Only for Martin to eat his hands all the way down to the wrist. Q finally makes a stand of his own, Martin jumps on him, and starts eating his shoulder. Next thing Q knows, Martin is off of him, and Alice is now in the ring, AND BOY DID THEY LEAVE OUT A HELLA GOOD FIGHT!!!! Alice doesn't need any deity sperm prom juice. Nahuh. She is pure hellcat perfection. It starts with the battle magic she and Penny created, then she adds more, even delving into martial arts, and finally, she's battling Martin in different animal forms. And she's winning until she doesn't, and then she takes the only route she can see to winning, becoming a niffin. Q blacks out shortly after.

Alice is ""dead"", and Q has been asleep for 6 months at the Centars Retreat. Eliot and Janet become kings and queens of Fillory. He spirals into grief and, yes, self-hatred and hatred for everything else. You can tell he's now starting to grow, slowly. He notices his shoulder is replaced with wood, and so is his knee, even though he doesn’t recall anything happening to his knee. Q's hair also turned white. Here, he decides to dive into magic and Fillory. He ends up figuring out his thesis-like project on flying to the moon, completes Alice's too, and figures out Mayakovsky's trick to kill an animal and reanimate its soul. He even figured out the spells Penny and Alice created. The man embraces his talents and becomes a pretty badass magician. He also trains physically, and yes, with a bow. Here, he spots the white Stag—the questing creature. (I could be merging memories on this as I was past ready for the book to end. Either he saw it at the retreat or read about it and then went in search of it) Q ventures out in search of it. Even hired a crew and sailed the sands. He explores a good portion of one small section of the world of Fillory.

Once he's found the creature, he asks for Alice back, and he willingly asks for Penny, and yes, he said his 'friend Penny's hands'. Both of which the Stag could not do. Penny because either he wasn't alive or wasn't in this world. An Alice because he just couldn't. Q then wished that the Stag could do so. The Stag said he'd count these three as the one wish, one he couldn't fulfill, and to ask for two more. So Q asked for his crew to be paid triple and to go home.

Transported to the apartment Q and A shared, he set off for something mundane. Q ends up bumping into Anais and finds out it's been 2 years here on Earth. Speaks about his knee getting bitten by a shark on their way to the retreat. He ends up working at a building where he just plays video games and magics his way through everything else. There, he meets Emily Greenstreet, who flirts with him over coffee. Once they saw each other, they both recognized they were magicians, and so she kept hounding him with emails, even going so far as to put coffee time with her on his work calendar. Their talk lasted a short period, and then he was back at the office. His window burst open, and three beings appeared before him.

One was floating among stars, with glowing violet eyes, Janet. The other had white wings behind him and a crown on his head, Eliot. The third was a dark shroud whom Q referred to as a hedge witch, and she made a snarky retort back, Juliet. (I think it literally was fuck you.) The Kings and Queens of Fillory.

Penny is in the Netherlands in front of a door with his nubs stretched out. The doors open, revealing columns of books.

The End of Book One.

I'm currently working on Book Two 'The Magician King'

We all got this super intense email, like, ""EVERY SINGLE VISITOR MUST SIGN IN AND WAIT FOR CLEARANCE, NO EXCEPTIONS!!"" It was in all caps, bold, underlined, the whole shebang.

Now, I'm just a lowly front desk grunt, so usually when the big wigs come through, I don't say boo. They just breeze by like they own the place (which, I mean, they kinda do).

But yesterday, the regional manager himself strolls in for some big meeting. He gives me a nod and a grin and starts making a beeline for the executive elevator.

Normally, I'd just smile and let him do his thing. But hey, the email said what it said, no exceptions. So I put on my customer service voice and I'm like, ""Excuse me sir, I'm gonna need you to sign our visitor log and wait juuuust a moment while I radio this in for ya.""

You should have SEEN the look on his face. It was like a mix of shocked Pikachu and that blinking white guy gif. Like, the audacity of this peon asking him to follow a rule!

But to his credit, he actually plopped down in the lobby armchair and waited. And waited. And waaaaaited. I swear, it was like security was on a coffee break or moving in slow motion. Ten whole minutes this dude is just twiddling his thumbs while his fancy meeting is about to start.

Finally, I get the all clear and I'm like, ""You're good to go, sir, have a wonderful day!"" with my biggest retail grin. He kinda side-eyed me as he hustled to the elevator, probably cursing my name with every step.

Fast forward to this morning, and whaddya know, we get a brand spanking new email that basically says ""Okay use your brains, execs can skip the sign in rigamarole."" Gee, wonder what prompted that change of heart?

But man, it was so worth it to watch Mr. Big Shot have to cool his heels like the rest of us peons for once. I mean, rules are rules, right? Guess they only apply until they inconvenience the top brass.
