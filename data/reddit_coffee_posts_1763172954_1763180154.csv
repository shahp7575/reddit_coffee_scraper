Equipment for what it's worth is a Kalita 102, Hario Switch--mostly using the switch. I generally make a 12 ounce cup, grind most of my coffees the same way, use local roasters primarily.  I've been questing for the best local roaster. I find most people send me somewhere I get the beans and frankly ""meh"".  I've found 2-3 roasters that I make coffee the same way and Wow! That quest for the near perfect cup is fulfilled. 

I won't knock recipes, techniques etc. I have a scale, have a gooseneck kettle, water heater, pyrex measuring, mellowdrip, good filters. I've basically dialed in my grind (use an old Peugeot --I mean real old box grinder or a Zassenhaus), got my water temp I like which in my mind considers heat transfer to pyrex to kettle, ceramic cones (the Hario and the Kalita). 

Find your beans folks-and yeah your beans may not be someone else's best beans. I can say that most of the very well regarded roasters around me--it is Meh--good but not great. I've got my couple roasters local that just always hit me with good beans and I've tried it across almost all their blends. (6 Depot out of Stockbridge Mass) to my mouth.  It's my baseline for comparing any other roast. I'm wide open (north east) to finding better than that. It's just most that send me to Deans Beans or Share, Stumptown when I'm in NYC---nah. 

Find your favorite beans or if you haven't buy the best beans you can get and afford. It is a game changer.  I can say I'm about a 1 minute bloom person, switch up, slow pour switch down for the rest of my brew. ",1,1763179878.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I have some general questions about having a birthday for a toddler as this is the first one without it just being family.  

We are doing a party for our 4 year old at an indoor playground. We dont have many friends with kids so we haven't done one before and only been to a couple.  

We have about 11-13 kids coming, with parents obviously. Each kid gets a pizza or hot dog, juice, chips. We are getting an extra sandwich and fruit platter, coffee and obviously cake.  

My main questions would be:  

Do we get more food for parents? Its from 11-2 so its lunch time. We dont mind ordering more stuff just dont want to spend 200$ if people dont touch it. Theres sandwhich, fruit, veggie, pastry and hot food (fries and chicken strips)  

Is blowing a candle out still a thing on a shared cake, do we cut it then give him a slice to blow out?  

Also is there anything that people do/dont do at parties that isnt fun or is annoying?  ",1,1763179603.0,daddit,0,1.0,False

It was always tough to see coworkers just chug it all day long and be unaffected.

It does cause me to have a BM almost instantly, but it’s mostly a formed stool and just a normal reaction many people have to caffeine. 

I know matcha is way less caffeine than a coffee, but there must also be something else going on as even decaf messes with my system.

1oxhu8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HokeyPokeyGuestList/comments/1oxhu8l/a_feral_housewife_and_mother_gets_help/,"A Feral Housewife and Mother gets ""help"".","Last week, on Friday, my Aunt Dot dropped around a bag of assorted coffee pods, saying they are a present from my Cousin Louise to help with making coffee while I'm recovering from my illness.

There is one teensy, weensy little problem with her present: we don't have a coffee machine that will take those pods.

In fact, we don't have a coffee machine at all. We're kind of old school, and still use a kettle to boil water for coffee. Personally, I find a kettle more versatile, because it boils water for tea and instant gravy as well as coffee. (Is there a market for gravy pods, do you think?)

I'm undecided how to deal with these white elephant coffee pods. Martin, my Toy Boy husband, thinks they will go in the coffee machine at work. If they don't fit, he can use the office equivalent of sticking stuff on the nature strip; putting the bag in the tea room with a sign that says ""FREE"". He says that way, the coffee pods will eventually go to someone who will use and appreciate them.

The kind, caring and sharing part of me really appreciates that solution. But the Feral part of me who has been dealing with Louise for years wants to hang onto them until early December, put them in a box, wrap it nicely with some ribbon, and give them back to her for her birthday.

Louise has a history of giving away things she doesn't want anymore, regardless of whether you want or need them. If you try to decline, she gets very angry and aggressive. She's also been known to just come back and leave whatever unwanted item it is that she's giving away at people's houses, when they are not home. My youngest sister (the Evil One) thinks Louise hates throwing things away, so she foists her unwanted stuff onto other people. This means Louise gets to feel good about ""helping"" other people, and someone else has to go to the effort of actually dealing with her unwanted crap.

I guess I should be thankful though. She's talking about replacing her fridge soon; since she tends to rotate through the family, the recent gift of coffee pods mean I'm unlikely to end up with her old fridge.",10,1763179118.0,u_HokeyPokeyGuestList,1,1.0,False

She had cellulitis that turned into sepsis. We were close, I’m an only child. But, she wasn’t an overbearing mother and I never felt like she was “too much” when it came to our relationship. You’ll understand why I point this out soon.

My husband and I have been cleaning out her home over the past month, preparing to sell it. Nothing she had was really out of the ordinary, old yearbooks, some of her grandmothers things, typical stuff an older lady would have.

We both took the day off to clean out the last area, her storage room. It started out normal, going through boxes of holiday decorations, photo albums, what you’d expect in a storage room.

Then my husband found a chest, hidden under boxes and tubs. It’s fairly big, the size of a coffee table. He opened it up and started going through it while I was looking through a photo album. I heard him say “aww” and he held up a baggie with a lock of my hair in it and a label that said “my name first haircut”. So, of course, I wanted to see what else was in it.

At first, I found things that made me feel sentimental: my first tooth, my first piece of jewelry (baby rings were a thing back then), my newborn photo, etc. And then things took a turn…

I discovered a bag with my first toothbrush in it. Weird but whatever. Then a bag with fingernails and toenails from my first nail clipping. And then a bag with my umbilical cord stump. A bag with my first pacifier. One with my first DIRTY DIAPER, double bagged. I was grossed out, scared to keep going but I couldn’t stop. It was morbid fascination.

In between the bizarre things, I found nostalgic items like my first book, my first shoes, and my first baby doll.

And then I get to the thing that made my stomach turn and my “fascination” halt…..my first maxi pad. Yes, it was USED and in a baggie. I literally screamed in horror. My husband gagged. We said nothing to each other for a full 5 minutes. Just staring at it on the floor where I dropped it and staring back at each other.

Finally, my husband broke the silence by trying to make me laugh. “So, donation pile?” I did giggle for a second but then went straight back to sheer horror. Then he closed the chest and said “enough for today.”

I had no idea she kept these things. I didn’t even think she was the type to keep more than my first lock of hair or hospital bracelet. She wasn’t a hoarder. Her home is clean and she never hesitated to throw something away if it was broken or old. I’m left with a question that I’ll never get answered, “why?” Why keep this stuff? Scratch that, why keep this TRASH that happens to be my first something? I don’t understand it. She never seemed overly sentimental. Or mentally ill, for that matter.

Who knows what else is in this chest? I may have sorted through 1/10 of what’s in there, if that. Maybe I found the worst of it. But the possibility that I didn’t, hinders me from wanting to find out.",3,1763179101.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I’m a teacher with three kids, which means life is loud, busy, and I’m exhausted most days. In the past year, I’ve tried starting over a few times. I’ll get a few short runs done. Something slow, hard, and humbling. I finish each run and actually felt decent afterward. And then… nothing. A whole week goes by. A month. And the maybe the cycle starts over

I’m physically tired after work, mentally tapped out, and there’s this annoying voice that says, “You used to do this way better” which somehow makes it harder to lace up. On top of that, there’s no health reasons I can’t do this

So for those of you who’ve been here, how did you break the cycle and get back into running when you already knew it would help, but the motivation just wasn’t there?

Did you join a group? Lower the mileage? Start with run/walk? Bribe yourself with coffee?

The concept is simple: It’s designed to let you talk freely (like you’re talking to yourself/reflection) but friends can ""step into the mirror"" and respond immediately. It bridges that gap between ""talking it out alone"" and ""being heard.""

I’m not a big company, just an introvert who needed a better way to communicate. I’m sharing this here because I know I can’t be the only one who walks down the street having full summits with themselves.

Does anyone else use self-talk as their primary therapy? And would a tool like this actually help you, or do you prefer the solitude?

1oxhrwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1oxhrwj/the_richard_madrigals/,The Richard Madrigals,"Richard Madrigal awoke at six thirty in the morning on the top floor of the tallest residential building in the city to the sound of Richard Madrigal playing violin. He was getting better, Richard Madrigal, but that was to be expected for someone practising fourteen hours a day.

Richard Madrigal sat up in bed, yawned and pushed his feet into slippers.

The view was magnificent.

He could smell the coffee Richard Madrigal was brewing in the kitchen. He hoped there would be eggs too, and bacon, toast. Lately there had been, but Richard Madrigal was branching out in new culinary directions.

After showering, Richard Madrigal drank the coffee and ate the breakfast Richard Madrigal had prepared, while, in the next room, Richard Madrigal was starting his one-hour morning workout. It was Friday, and Richard Madrigal wanted to be pumped and ready for tonight's outing.

Although he was fifty-six years old, most Richard Madrigals didn't look it—and the Richard Madrigal working out, least of all. He was fit, in peak health, properly hormoned, exceedingly fertile and very very good looking.

Richard Madrigal sat at his desk, slouched, checked his correspondences for anything interesting, then opened the Alterious app. He'd been one of the first people to try the service, and he was now its most famous user. It had maxed out his life.

On the Overview page, he saw what all seven of his Alters were currently doing:

     00 (062%) | n/a
     01 (015%) | business strategy (a)
     02 (010%) | work call: Hong Kong (a)
     03 (000%) | sleeping
     04 (005%) | housework
     05 (003%) | exercise
     06 (005%) | violin
     07 (000%) | sleeping

That was fine with Richard Madrigal. To be honest, he didn't even feel much of a difference between functioning at 60% or 100%. He considered waking one of his sleeping Alters and putting it on a work task, but decided against it. He'd sub one out if the first got tired.
___

“It just ain't fair,” Larker was saying, huddling around a small plastic table with his slopster co-workers. They were on break. “I don't hate the tech necessarily—just that it's so doubledamn cost-prohibitive. What's one clone cost these days, like $7b, right? So us guys here, we can't afford that. Only the rich can. And the rich already have an advantage over us because they're rich, so all the tech does is amplify their advantage. Ya dig, KitKat?”

KitKat was sucking on her mangoglop. “Mhm.”

“Like—like… take Richard Madrigal. The Inspectator did a bio ad-piece on him last month. The guy's got a clone just for fucking! For fuck's sake. All that clone does is eat healthy, work out and fuck. And whenever he wants, along comes fat old Richard Madrigal to switch his consciousness over and enjoy the experience. Shiiit.”

“Sounds like yer jealous.”

“Of course I am. And if you ain't, you should be too. Tell me, honestly, if—”

The bell rang, ending break, and Larker, KitKat and the rest of them went back to their stations to sort through AI-gen'd slop for usable content.

ratpacker.v1.2.txt transited the raw connections e-hitching rides on highwayd 1s and 0s while his body—what was left of it—sat decomposing in front of his shitware laptop in a downtown Tokyo microapartment. The body had been dead for weeks but ratpacker.v.1.2.txt was still very much alive online, one of many young Japanese of his self-lost generation who'd been netgen zombied.

The process was easy: rec your life to human-unreadable rawtext, AI-lyze that into a personality, get-pet yourself a worm or virus, backdoor insert into a botlab and interface with the world through the hijacked highline interpreter. Was it real, was it human: yes, no. But what was so great about degradable flesh anyway?

Lately ratpacker.v1.2.txt had been chatting with a flesh-real disaffect from half a world away, discussing via encrypted zazachat the theoretical way one could kill an altered personality:

bonzomantis: *youd need to kill all the conscious alters or they could remake themselves, yeah theyd be down a clone so youd hit them financially but you wouldnt end the self, ya dig what i say*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *maybe…*

bonzomantis: *whatd you mean maybe*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *what you say is true if consciousness is distributed at the time of death. if that's the case, you'd need to kill all non-00% alters to kill the self in a way that prevents regeneration*

bonzomantis: *yeah thats what i mean so its impossible because how could you ever get close to do all of them at the same time like that*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *unless you killed one when that one was at 100%, for example if the original had one clone and one of the two was sleeping and you killed the non-sleeping one*

bonzomantis: *whatd happen then?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *the 00% would de-self, the physical presence persisting but no more mind*

bonzomantis: *anyway the guy im thinking of isnt so simple because hes got more than one clone*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i thought this was all in theory*

bonzomantis: *it is in theory how to destroy a specific person dig?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *who?*

bonzomantis: *doesnt matter*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *how many clones?*

bonzomantis: *seven plus the original*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *richard madrigal*

bonzomantis: *what*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *you want to kill an original with seven clones. richard madrigal is the only known original with seven clones. therefore, you want to kill richard madrigal*

bonzomantis: *and so what if i do, i cant anyway because its impossible*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *not impossible. you just need accurate information and correct timing*

bonzomantis: *ya because like hell suddenly cut consciousness to all of his selves but one yeah i dont think so*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *he might*

bonzomantis: *lol when?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *when he's maximizing for pleasure*

bonzomantis: 

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *are you still there?*

bonzomantis: *you mean when hes fucking*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *yes*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt liked bonzomantis a lot and could spend hours chatting with him.
___

“Anyone seen Larker?” asked KitKat. He hadn't been at work for a few days. She wasn't sure how many because it was hard to tell them apart.

“Maybe he's sick.”

“Maybe.”

“Anyone know where he lives?”

“Nuh-uh. No.”

“Isn't it nice to sit around on break and not have to listen to that nuthead wax on about Richard Madrigal? I mean, guy has an obsession.”

The bell rang, calling them back to work. They returned obediently to their stations.
___

Richard Madrigal marched his toned, waxed body into StarSpangler's Knight Club, inhaling the sweet intoxication of pheromones, perfume and arousal as he passed by the bouncers, through the front doors. “Mr. Madrigal,” said one, tipping his hat.

“Charlie,” said Richard Madrigal.

The inside of the club was unimaginably opulent bedlam. **Thump**-thump-*thumping* music. ***Pulsing*** rhythm-lights. Famous faces, and even more famous bodies. Dancing, posing, gyrating. Richard Madrigal identified his latest crush and made straight for her, transferring money to cover her tab as he did.

She was:

PollyAnnaXcess, young, international pop star and Richard Madrigal's number one slut.
___

bonzomantis: *how do ya know that and dont tell me you hacked alterious*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i didn't hack alterious. their security is too advanced. hacking them would be unrealistic and likely catastrophic for me. i infiltrated the servers of the company PopLite*

bonzomantis: *what the hells poplite?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *it is a celebrity service for the creation of synthdolls*

bonzomantis: *you hallucinating? i dont follow*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i don't hallucinate. i’m not an artificial intelligence*

bonzomantis: *sry*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *PopLite has porous security protocols, allowing me read-access to their servers*

bonzomantis: *cool but what does that have to do with our thing*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *one of PopLite's clients is the singer PollyAnnaXcess. by accessing her synthdoll's logs i was able to ascertain that Richard Madrigal regularly meets with it for sexual intercourse*

bonzomantis: *wut does he like know hes fucking a fucking doll?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *almost certainly no*

bonzomantis: *lol lol lolo*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *this is your way in, if you want it*

bonzomantis:

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *bonzomantis, are you interested in more details about a theoretical way to kill Richard Madrigal? if not, we may chat about another topic. but please respond. i hate it when you blank and idle*

bonzomantis: *no im interested, but its just you said you have read-access so how can you read a way in for me?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i can't. however, you can do that part yourself*
___

It was a Friday night. The area in front of StarSpangler's Knight Club was packed with celebriphiles, peeps who didn't want to get into the club but wanted to see and vidcapture—*and touch*—the many celebrities who did.

It was part of the show.

A special red-carpeted corridor had been set up leading from the street, where the expensive vehicles rolled in, to the front doors.

Loud, desperate crowds pressed forward on both sides, and among them was Larker, elbowing his way to the front while fingering the pin-tipped memdrive ratpacker.v1.2.txt had programmed for him.

The instructions were simple: get close to PollyAnnaXcess’ synthdoll as she was arriving and prick her with the memdrive, which would auto-up its contents on penetration then erase itself, so if anyone found the drive it would be an empty electronic husk.

Larker carried out the instructions.
___

The private cops always came in pairs. KitKat opened the door to see two thick, gundog faces. “You the slopster called KitKat?” one asked.

She let them in because otherwise they'd let themselves in, which carried with it the risk of a court-sanctioned beating or worse, because some judges got off vicariously on bodycam footage.

“Yeah, I'm KitKat.”

“We're looking for Larker.”

“Don't live here.”

“Right, but the two of you—you work together, isn't that true, sweetsnack?

“He hasn't been to work in a while.”

“How long a while?”

“Dunno.”

“Do you know where he is?”

“No.”

“Aww, that's cute. How about where he lives, do you know that?”

“No,” said KitKat.

“We can get the information other ways,"" said one of the cops, the bigger one, starting to drool.

“Then you don't need my help,” said KitKat.

“Growl some more, will ya?”

“Why do you want him anyway—he do something wrong or something?”

“That's not for lowly boys like us to know, sweetsnack.”

“Then get out,” said KitKat.

“Wildcat, this one,” said the second cop to the first, as the first started undoing his belt and the one who'd spoken turned on his bodycam.
___

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *are you ready to proceed?*

bonzomantis: *i think so but this is fucked. and what if he leaves some of his consciousness in one of the other clones?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *statistically, it's the best chance you'll have. if it doesn't work, you'll have decommissioned a clone and you can always try again*

bonzomantis: *youve never even asked why i want to kill richard madrigal*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *that's because it doesn't matter to me. i want to help you achieve your goal because you're my friend, not because i share your goal*

Larker took a deep breath, got up from his gaming chair and paced around his small bedroom. He wondered whether he'd gone crazy. He was nervous, tense and somehow also alive and excited. This idea—of entering a female synthdoll and *being it* to kill Richard Madrigal—was far out. How much will I feel, he wondered.

bonzomantis: *ok lets do it*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *excellent. i'll need you to follow the instructions i gave you to psyconnect to the net through your headset. don't worry. it's something i used to do all the time as a flesh real*

Larker ate a candy bar in three bites, sat down and pulled on the headset. It was a tight fit—and then the sensors came out, on wires that wriggled up his nose, behind his eyeballs and into his ears. He felt discomfort, violation; until ratpacker.v1.2.txt executed the synthdoll script *and* (“Whoa!”) *it was like Larker was really there…*

**inside StarSpangler's Knight Club,**

Richard Madrigal walked over to who he thought was the real PollyAnnaXcess, kissed her and ordered drinks enhanced with redtender. For once, she recoiled at his touch, but he didn't make much of it. Maybe, he thought, I need to update my Alter's fitness routine.

After drinking and dancing, Richard Madrigal took PollyAnnaXcess* up to his private room and switched 100% of his consciousness to the task at hand.
___

“Damn,” said the cop standing over KitKat's body on the floor of her apartment unit, “when sweetsnack said she wouldn't tell us, she meant it.”

“Don't meet many like her no more,” commented the other cop.

He was spent.

“Kinda noble not to rat on a chum.”

“I'll say.” He prodded KitKat with his boot. “She, uh, unconscious—or is she dead?”

“Who the fuck cares.”
___

*It was strange, making out with a man, a man you hated but had never met, feeling his hands all over your surreally female synthetic body, made you want to throw up and enjoy it at the same time, so bizarre, so new and exhilarating, as your heart beat and he caressed your body, and you caressed your body too, no wonder he couldn't tell artificial from real because there was no physical difference, technology, man, tech-fucking-nology…*

Larker knew he had to do it:

Kill,

because that was the whole point, but he kept delaying it, kept rationalizing the delay. *Mmm,* oh, yes, yes, just a few more minutes, a few extra moments of this bodyhacking, psycho*boom* hedonist whatthefuck…
___

“Did the employer come through?” the first cop asked the second.

They were cruising.

“No, random tip. Ain't that funny.”

“Sure it's legit?

“Not at all, but what's the harm in taking a drive and having a  looksie—you got anything better to do?”
___

**Boot.** **Boot.** Go! The door to Larker's apartment came crashing down. Two private cops barged in. Larker was sitting at his laptop in a headset, eyes rolled back into his head, his pants around his ankles and one of his hands down his wet boxer shorts, moaning.

“That him?”

The other cop checked the database. “Affirmative.”

They pulled out their guns and executed him on the spot for the attempted murder of a Class-A citizen.
___

KitKat stirred, opened her puffed up eyes and dragged her battered body to her minicomm.

She called Larker.

No answer.

No answer.

No answer.
___

bonzomantis: *what the fuck!!!*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i'm sorry, Larker. i just wanted a friend, that's all. a true friend*

bonzomantis: *what happened where or how or what am i whats going on huh*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *your body is dead. it was killed by the police, after i denounced you and told them about your plan to kill Richard Madrigal*

I don’t have a huge circle of friends, and honestly, when I do try to open up, I often feel like people are just waiting for their turn to speak rather than actually hearing me.

As an HSP, I absorb so much feeling from everyday matters—a weird look from a stranger, a loud noise, a sad song. It builds up inside.

To cope, I developed this habit: I put on my headphones, go for a walk, and I talk. I talk to myself like I am my own best friend. I speak the worries out loud, and strangely, the moment I hear my own voice saying them, the anxiety lifts. It’s like immediate fulfillment. I feel validated because I listened.

But recently, I hit a wall. talking to myself is safe, but it can get lonely. I realized I wanted that same ""safe space"" feeling but with the ability to actually be heard by someone I trust—immediate feedback, but without the pressure of a face-to-face coffee date or a chaotic group chat.

1oxhl28,https://v.redd.it/mq1s1k4ydc1g1,The Stunning Desk Ritual: A Workplace Comedy,"# TIFU by treating my new standing desk like a temperamental, sentient alien god for two weeks straight.

Throwaway because my colleagues have been leaving small river stones and dried flowers on my desk all morning. I don't know if they're mocking me or participating in the ritual now.

# Background

I (31M) just started my dream job at a boutique data visualization firm. It's a fancy, modern place, full of high-tech gear and minimalist design. I was determined to prove I wasn't just book-smart but also *culture*\-smart and tech-savvy.

On my first day, the office manager, Barb, was giving me the tour. We reached my workspace, which had a beautiful, electronically controlled sit/stand desk.

Barb, waving vaguely at the expensive machinery, said, ""And this is your desk. We’re really proud of the desks here—they’re top-of-the-line. They’re all **standing desks**.""

For reasons that are still hazy (maybe I was dehydrated, maybe I was just nervous), my brain processed this as ""Stunning **Desks.""**

I nodded gravely. *Ah,* I thought. *A new piece of proprietary tech. A smart desk that requires environmental and behavioral conditioning to maintain its ""stunning"" status.* Clearly, it was too advanced to simply *stand* at. It must be motion-activated and require positive reinforcement to function optimally.

# The Ritual Begins

My desk stayed stubbornly in the sitting position all day. I tapped the buttons—nothing. I assumed the desk was waiting for me to establish a positive relationship before it would *deign* to ascend.

**Day 1: Admiration.** I took five minutes every hour to stand back, nod slowly, and whisper things like, ""Look at that grain, so efficient,"" and, ""You're exceptionally ergonomic today, Stunning Desk."" My neighbor, Chad, just wore headphones and didn't seem to notice. *Good,* I thought, *this ritual must be performed privately.*

**Day 4: Offerings.** The desk was still sitting. I deduced that verbal praise was insufficient. It needed a tangible connection to the natural world. I started bringing small, shiny tokens—a perfectly smooth river stone, a single, flawless grape (quickly eaten after 30 minutes of non-response), and a brightly colored paperclip. I carefully placed them on the power grommet, treating it like a tiny altar.

**Day 8: Performance Art.** I needed to convey my *full* reverence. Before touching the height adjustment panel (the ""Ascension Pedestal""), I started a slow, respectful, 360-degree twirl, concluding in a low bow. I was convinced the desk required this kinetic demonstration of worthiness before it would move. It still didn't move. *Clearly, I was doing the twirl wrong.*

# The Climax (and the Crushing Reality)

This morning was the pinnacle of my dedication. I had decided the desk needed poetry.

I stood before it, holding a slightly crumpled printout of a haiku I wrote in the breakroom about structural integrity, and began whispering:

""Oh, wise tabletop, your sturdy steel supports all. Now, *ascend*, please, rise.""

I did my twirl, I bowed, and I pressed the UP arrow button, fully expecting the desk to finally acknowledge my devotion. It remained perfectly still.

Just as I was about to blame my poor word choice, my team lead, Sarah, walked past with a client. She stopped dead.

""Gary,"" she said, her voice a cocktail of confusion and professional terror. ""What... what exactly are you doing with the **standing desk**?""

I beamed, proud to explain my technological dedication. ""Ah, Sarah! I’m just performing the daily maintenance ritual for the **Stunning Desk**! It’s a very sensitive, high-end model, you see. It only operates when it recognizes your sincere admiration. I've tried praise, offerings, and today, poetry, but I can't seem to get it to ascend. I think the paperclip was the wrong color.""

Sarah blinked. The client choked on his coffee.

She stepped closer, looked at the desk, and then looked at me.

""Gary,"" she said slowly. ""It's a standing desk. You know, you stand up at it.""

""Yes! And I am ready to stand, but the Stunning Desk must allow it!""

""Gary. Did you... did you plug it in? To the wall?""

I stared at the exposed power cord dangling neatly next to the nearest wall outlet, which I had somehow interpreted as a *decorative feature* or a *sensory antenna*.

I had been performing elaborate, silent rituals for a completely unplugged, standard piece of office furniture for two weeks.

I plugged it in. I tapped the UP arrow. It smoothly ascended with a soft whirring sound.

I am now known as ""Poetry Desk Gary."" And yes, I found another river stone next to my monitor. I think I'll leave it there. It's the Stunning Desk's favorite.

A Clear, Trustworthy Guide You Can Rely On","If you’ve ever had a Pap test or are planning to get one, it’s natural to wonder what exactly it can detect. Many people assume a Pap smear checks for *all* sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including herpes. But the truth is more nuanced, and understanding it can save you a lot of confusion, anxiety, and unnecessary worry.

Accurate information about herpes testing is especially important because herpes (HSV-1 and HSV-2) is extremely common, often misunderstood, and frequently misdiagnosed. Getting clarity empowers you to make confident decisions about your health and talk openly with your healthcare provider.



# Understanding the Basics: What a Pap Test Really Detects

A Pap test (or Pap smear) is primarily designed to screen for **abnormal cervical cell changes** that may lead to **cervical cancer**. It does *not* serve as a universal STI test.

Here’s what a Pap test **can** detect:

* Abnormal cervical cells
* Precancerous changes
* Cervical cancer
* Sometimes HPV-related cellular abnormalities (when paired with HPV testing)

And what it **cannot** detect:

* Herpes (HSV-1 or HSV-2)
* Chlamydia
* Gonorrhea
* HIV
* Syphilis

# So… Can a Pap Test Detect Herpes?

The simple answer is **no**.  
A Pap test **cannot** detect herpes directly because herpes is diagnosed through:

* A swab test **taken from an active sore**
* A blood test checking for HSV antibodies

**Pap smears do not capture or analyze herpes virus cells**, and herpes symptoms often do not appear on the cervix in a way the test would detect.

**Important note:**  
Rarely, a Pap test may show inflammation or suspicious cells that *prompt* a doctor to test for herpes—but this is indirect and uncommon.



# How Herpes is Actually Diagnosed

If you suspect herpes, these are the accurate methods:

# 1. Viral Swab Test (Gold Standard)

* Done when sores/blisters are present
* Can determine HSV-1 vs HSV-2
* Highest accuracy within 48 hours of symptoms

# 2. Blood Test (Antibody Test)

* Helpful when there are *no* visible symptoms
* Detects antibodies for HSV-1 and HSV-2
* Not perfect, but commonly used

# 3. Clinical Examination

* A doctor may diagnose based on visible symptoms
* Not always reliable, as many conditions mimic herpes

**If you’re experiencing repeated symptoms or need clarity, it’s important to seek proper testing—not rely on a Pap test for herpes detection.**



# Step-by-Step Action Plan if You Think You Might Have Herpes

Here’s a simple, practical routine to follow:

# Day 1

1. **Check for Physical Symptoms:** Look for tingling, itching, small bumps, blisters, or sores.
2. **Avoid Touching or Scratching:** This reduces spreading the virus to other areas.
3. **Schedule a Medical Appointment:** Tell your provider you want an HSV test—not a Pap test.

# Day 2–3

1. **Get a Swab Test if Symptoms Are Active:** Do this ASAP for best accuracy.
2. **If No Symptoms, Request a Blood Test:** Ask specifically for HSV-1 and HSV-2 typing.

# Day 4–7

1. **Start Following Symptom Relief Habits:**
   * Keep the area clean and dry
   * Avoid shaving over outbreaks
   * Wear loose clothing

# Additional Tip:

If you’re dealing with ongoing outbreaks or anxiety around herpes, many people find comfort trying natural approaches in addition to medical guidance.  
Additionally, if you are suffering with herpes I will recommend you to visit **HerpesCureForever. Org**, so far it is one of the best options people have been talking about for real relief.



# Expert Recommendations: What Doctors Want You to Know

Doctors consistently emphasize the following:

# 1. Herpes is Common

Over half of adults have HSV-1, and about 1 in 6 have HSV-2.  
Many have it without knowing.

# 2. Symptoms Can Be Mild or Invisible

Some people never experience outbreaks, which is why proper testing is essential.

# 3. Early Treatment Helps

Antiviral medications:

* Reduce outbreak severity
* Shorten healing time
* Lower the chance of spreading the virus

# 4. A Pap Test Isn’t Enough

Your doctor may perform a Pap test during a pelvic exam, but don’t assume it includes herpes testing. **You must request HSV tests separately**.



# Lifestyle and Nutrition Factors That Affect Herpes Outbreaks

While diet won’t cure herpes, certain habits can reduce or trigger outbreaks.

# Helpful Lifestyle Practices

* Get regular sleep
* Manage stress effectively
* Hydrate well
* Prioritize immune-supportive habits

# Nutrition Tips

**Foods that may help reduce outbreaks:**

* Leafy greens
* Berries
* Eggs
* Fish
* Nuts and seeds

**Foods some people avoid during outbreaks:**

* Excess chocolate
* Peanuts
* Sugary snacks
* Excess coffee

Everyone is different, so pay attention to what triggers *your* body.



# Do’s and Don’ts for Herpes Testing and Management

# Do:

* Ask specifically for HSV testing
* Seek a swab test during outbreaks
* Practice safe sex during symptoms
* Keep communication open with partners
* Support your immune system

# Don’t:

* Assume a Pap test checks for herpes
* Self-diagnose without proper testing
* Panic if you receive a positive result
* Ignore persistent symptoms
* Share personal items that touch the affected area



# Common Mistakes People Make

Here are the biggest misunderstandings:

1. **Thinking a normal Pap test means they don’t have herpes** (It doesn’t check for it at all.)
2. **Waiting too long to get a swab test** The virus becomes harder to detect as lesions heal.
3. **Not confirming HSV type (1 or 2)** Knowing the type helps guide treatment and expectations.
4. **Assuming herpes means someone was unfaithful** HSV can remain dormant for years.
5. **Believing herpes is rare** It’s extremely common and manageable.



# Conclusion: Knowledge Is Power—Take Control of Your Testing and Health

Understanding that a Pap test **cannot** detect herpes is an important step in taking control of your sexual health. By asking for the right tests, paying attention to symptoms, and following supportive lifestyle habits, you can manage herpes confidently and without unnecessary fear.

If you’re currently dealing with herpes and want additional support, many people explore natural solutions alongside medical care. Additionally, if you are suffering with herpes I will recommend you to visit **HerpesCureForever.

 I don't remembed a large portion of my childhood but I know she began drinking when I was around 7. Ever since, she got worse the more she hated me. She has beat me up and ripped my hair out when pouring her drink down the sink, twisting my words and starting arguments as an excuse to shout at me, getting fired from her nursing job because she was treating patients while drunk and also stealing prescription drugs. She caused me to fall into a deep depression and I was unable to finish school and had to drop out. She was financially controlling, manipulative, psychologically and physically abusive and she has given me a dissociation disorder from the ongoing trauma.

Well until August this year, her body couldn't handle it anymore. The night before, she was threatening to kick me out if I didn't send her money for vodka, she bought about 4 bottles. She took loads of Bendryl and started hallucinating badly, trying to attack me and things she was seeing along with alcohol in her system.

The next morning, she was violently ill and vomiting up coffee grain vomit which was internal bleeding. She was turninf yellow, she had abdominal pain, hallucinating and drifting in and out of being delirious, being aggressive and violent, swollen and could barely move any of her limbs. Her throat began to close up and she said couldn't breath, then she collapsed and died on the spot. Her report came back as diphenhydramine toxicity with alcoholic liver disease.

Turns out, she didn't even die from alcohol, nor did she take a large amount of the sleeping pills. Her liver was so damaged beyond repair that it could not process the toxins, causing her to overdose on a small amount. I had to watch her die yet I feel nothing but peace.

I guess you can still be an alcoholic yet not have it be the thing that kills you!",13,1763178058.0,AlAnon,5,1.0,False

1oxhhsr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxhhsr,Costar Cosmos: A Terminal Case of Corporate Greed Masquerading as an Espresso Machine,"Everyone lies. Costar lies in its marketing. You’ll lie to yourself, trying to convince yourself that the bitter swill this thing produces is ""almost there."" It’s not. It’s a cry for help from a machine that should have been euthanized at the design stage.

I didn't just buy this machine; I performed a biopsy on it. My diagnosis? It's not an espresso machine. It's a stainless-steel monument to planned obsolescence, preying on the hopeful and the naive. It’s a tin can with an electrical cord and a pathological contempt for coffee.

The failure isn't immediate. That would be too merciful. No, this machine employs a strategy of gradual, debilitating decay, like a degenerative disease. It's a snake waiting for its prey, lulling you into a false sense of competence before striking at your wallet and your sanity.

Here’s the differential, in simple terms even their customer service bots might understand:

* **The ""Warranty"" is a Placebo.** They offer a one-year warranty because it makes the sticker price seem less offensive. It's a sugar pill for the terminally gullible. The moment you need it, you're not talking to a support team; you're trapped in a Kafkaesque chatbot loop staffed by algorithms that have the empathy of a petri dish. They don't solve your problem; they just downgrade your expectations until you accept that having a portafilter explode is a ""unique user experience.""
* **It's a Slippery Slope to the ER.** The symptoms start small, so you blame yourself. A leaky portafilter? ""I must not have tightened it enough."" A watery, pathetic excuse for a crema? ""My grind must be off."" You tinker, you adjust, you descend into madness. Then, if you're *lucky* enough to survive this phase without tossing it out the window, it delivers its pièce de résistance: **catastrophic, energetic disassembly**. In layman's terms, the portafilter blows up. The only thing separating your morning coffee from a trip to the ER is blind luck.
* **It Cultivates a Biohazard.** The constant, slow leakage from the faulty group head or the ill-fitting portafilter doesn't just make a mess. It creates a micro-ecosystem. You're not just brewing espresso; you're pioneering a new wetland habitat on your kitchen counter. In no time, you'll have a thriving mosquito ecosystem of your own, all thanks to Costar's commitment to bringing nature—specifically, malaria-carrying insects—into your home.
* **The Taste Profile of Regret.** The espresso this machine excretes is a bitter, hollow caricature. It has the subtlety of a textbook and the finish of burnt regret. Don't you dare waste your carefully sourced, artisanal beans in this cretinous contraption. You'd get a more nuanced and satisfying caffeine hit by chewing on the package your beans came in. As I told my long-suffering colleague, ""If you have this machine, drink your Nescafé. At least then the disappointment is honest.""
* **The Price Tag is a Symptom, Not a Feature.** The cost is a brilliant piece of psychological misdirection. It's just high enough to trick rookies into thinking they're buying a ""serious"" entry-level machine, and just low enough for Costar to cut every conceivable corner. It's a complete hogwash, designed for people who don't know that espresso shouldn't taste like it was filtered through a mechanic's rag.

**The Prognosis:** It's not a coffee machine. It's a 8000Rs lesson in skepticism and a public health advisory. It’s a toy for people who think coffee is a brown liquid, not a complex chemical extraction. Save your money. Buy a Moka pot. Buy an AeroPress. Hell, buy a second-hand microwave and just stare into the bulb until you feel awake. It's a safer and more rewarding experience than trusting this fraudulent, leaky, wildlife-attracting piece of scrap metal with your morning ritual.

This is purely anecdotal in nature. I forgot to take my meds this morning (atenolol) and here's how my day was. I hardly ever forget to take them. I left my water downstairs and forgot to grab them before I went down.

I didn't even realize I'd forgotten to take them for 2-3 hours. At that time I was already at work and halfway through my coffee. I realized I felt kind of anxious and that my heartrate felt fast. It dawned on me that I never grabbed them.

The morning was pretty manageable. I don't love the racing heart and anxiety, but all in all, nothing I haven't felt before.

I got home around 5pm, and by that point it seemed too late to take them, so I figured I would just take it easy for the night and remember my water.

Yall...I walked my dog and felt like I ran three marathons. I'm not talking any kind of hills, not even hot weather at this point in the day. I was hot and sweaty and felt pulsing throughout my head and body. 

As the night went on, I could manage less and less. Getting up the (single flight) stairs 15 minutes ago was a feat in and of itself. I have a headache and I'm tired of the jitters so it's bedtime.

1oxhad0,https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane/comments/1oxhad0/the_richard_madrigals/,The Richard Madrigals,"Richard Madrigal awoke at six thirty in the morning on the top floor of the tallest residential building in the city to the sound of Richard Madrigal playing violin. He was getting better, Richard Madrigal, but that was to be expected for someone practising fourteen hours a day.

Richard Madrigal sat up in bed, yawned and pushed his feet into slippers.

The view was magnificent.

He could smell the coffee Richard Madrigal was brewing in the kitchen. He hoped there would be eggs too, and bacon, toast. Lately there had been, but Richard Madrigal was branching out in new culinary directions.

After showering, Richard Madrigal drank the coffee and ate the breakfast Richard Madrigal had prepared, while, in the next room, Richard Madrigal was starting his one-hour morning workout. It was Friday, and Richard Madrigal wanted to be pumped and ready for tonight's outing.

Although he was fifty-six years old, most Richard Madrigals didn't look it—and the Richard Madrigal working out, least of all. He was fit, in peak health, properly hormoned, exceedingly fertile and very very good looking.

Richard Madrigal sat at his desk, slouched, checked his correspondences for anything interesting, then opened the Alterious app. He'd been one of the first people to try the service, and he was now its most famous user. It had maxed out his life.

On the Overview page, he saw what all seven of his Alters were currently doing:

     00 (062%) | n/a
     01 (015%) | business strategy (a)
     02 (010%) | work call: Hong Kong (a)
     03 (000%) | sleeping
     04 (005%) | housework
     05 (003%) | exercise
     06 (005%) | violin
     07 (000%) | sleeping

That was fine with Richard Madrigal. To be honest, he didn't even feel much of a difference between functioning at 60% or 100%. He considered waking one of his sleeping Alters and putting it on a work task, but decided against it. He'd sub one out if the first got tired.
___

“It just ain't fair,” Larker was saying, huddling around a small plastic table with his slopster co-workers. They were on break. “I don't hate the tech necessarily—just that it's so doubledamn cost-prohibitive. What's one clone cost these days, like $7b, right? So us guys here, we can't afford that. Only the rich can. And the rich already have an advantage over us because they're rich, so all the tech does is amplify their advantage. Ya dig, KitKat?”

KitKat was sucking on her mangoglop. “Mhm.”

“Like—like… take Richard Madrigal. The Inspectator did a bio ad-piece on him last month. The guy's got a clone just for fucking! For fuck's sake. All that clone does is eat healthy, work out and fuck. And whenever he wants, along comes fat old Richard Madrigal to switch his consciousness over and enjoy the experience. Shiiit.”

“Sounds like yer jealous.”

“Of course I am. And if you ain't, you should be too. Tell me, honestly, if—”

The bell rang, ending break, and Larker, KitKat and the rest of them went back to their stations to sort through AI-gen'd slop for usable content.

ratpacker.v1.2.txt transited the raw connections e-hitching rides on highwayd 1s and 0s while his body—what was left of it—sat decomposing in front of his shitware laptop in a downtown Tokyo microapartment. The body had been dead for weeks but ratpacker.v.1.2.txt was still very much alive online, one of many young Japanese of his self-lost generation who'd been netgen zombied.

The process was easy: rec your life to human-unreadable rawtext, AI-lyze that into a personality, get-pet yourself a worm or virus, backdoor insert into a botlab and interface with the world through the hijacked highline interpreter. Was it real, was it human: yes, no. But what was so great about degradable flesh anyway?

Lately ratpacker.v1.2.txt had been chatting with a flesh-real disaffect from half a world away, discussing via encrypted zazachat the theoretical way one could kill an altered personality:

bonzomantis: *youd need to kill all the conscious alters or they could remake themselves, yeah theyd be down a clone so youd hit them financially but you wouldnt end the self, ya dig what i say*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *maybe…*

bonzomantis: *whatd you mean maybe*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *what you say is true if consciousness is distributed at the time of death. if that's the case, you'd need to kill all non-00% alters to kill the self in a way that prevents regeneration*

bonzomantis: *yeah thats what i mean so its impossible because how could you ever get close to do all of them at the same time like that*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *unless you killed one when that one was at 100%, for example if the original had one clone and one of the two was sleeping and you killed the non-sleeping one*

bonzomantis: *whatd happen then?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *the 00% would de-self, the physical presence persisting but no more mind*

bonzomantis: *anyway the guy im thinking of isnt so simple because hes got more than one clone*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i thought this was all in theory*

bonzomantis: *it is in theory how to destroy a specific person dig?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *who?*

bonzomantis: *doesnt matter*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *how many clones?*

bonzomantis: *seven plus the original*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *richard madrigal*

bonzomantis: *what*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *you want to kill an original with seven clones. richard madrigal is the only known original with seven clones. therefore, you want to kill richard madrigal*

bonzomantis: *and so what if i do, i cant anyway because its impossible*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *not impossible. you just need accurate information and correct timing*

bonzomantis: *ya because like hell suddenly cut consciousness to all of his selves but one yeah i dont think so*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *he might*

bonzomantis: *lol when?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *when he's maximizing for pleasure*

bonzomantis: 

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *are you still there?*

bonzomantis: *you mean when hes fucking*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *yes*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt liked bonzomantis a lot and could spend hours chatting with him.

“Anyone seen Larker?” asked KitKat. He hadn't been at work for a few days. She wasn't sure how many because it was hard to tell them apart.

“Maybe he's sick.”

“Maybe.”

“Anyone know where he lives?”

“Nuh-uh. No.”

“Isn't it nice to sit around on break and not have to listen to that nuthead wax on about Richard Madrigal? I mean, guy has an obsession.”

The bell rang, calling them back to work. They returned obediently to their stations.
___

Richard Madrigal marched his toned, waxed body into StarSpangler's Knight Club, inhaling the sweet intoxication of pheromones, perfume and arousal as he passed by the bouncers, through the front doors. “Mr. Madrigal,” said one, tipping his hat.

“Charlie,” said Richard Madrigal.

The inside of the club was unimaginably opulent bedlam. **Thump**-thump-*thumping* music. ***Pulsing*** rhythm-lights. Famous faces, and even more famous bodies. Dancing, posing, gyrating. Richard Madrigal identified his latest crush and made straight for her, transferring money to cover her tab as he did.

She was:

PollyAnnaXcess, young, international pop star and Richard Madrigal's number one slut.
___

bonzomantis: *how do ya know that and dont tell me you hacked alterious*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i didn't hack alterious. their security is too advanced. hacking them would be unrealistic and likely catastrophic for me. i infiltrated the servers of the company PopLite*

bonzomantis: *what the hells poplite?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *it is a celebrity service for the creation of synthdolls*

bonzomantis: *you hallucinating? i dont follow*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i don't hallucinate. i’m not an artificial intelligence*

bonzomantis: *sry*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *PopLite has porous security protocols, allowing me read-access to their servers*

bonzomantis: *cool but what does that have to do with our thing*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *one of PopLite's clients is the singer PollyAnnaXcess. by accessing her synthdoll's logs i was able to ascertain that Richard Madrigal regularly meets with it for sexual intercourse*

bonzomantis: *wut does he like know hes fucking a fucking doll?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *almost certainly no*

bonzomantis: *lol lol lolo*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *this is your way in, if you want it*

bonzomantis:

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *bonzomantis, are you interested in more details about a theoretical way to kill Richard Madrigal? if not, we may chat about another topic. but please respond. i hate it when you blank and idle*

bonzomantis: *no im interested, but its just you said you have read-access so how can you read a way in for me?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i can't. however, you can do that part yourself*
___

It was a Friday night. The area in front of StarSpangler's Knight Club was packed with celebriphiles, peeps who didn't want to get into the club but wanted to see and vidcapture—*and touch*—the many celebrities who did.

It was part of the show.

A special red-carpeted corridor had been set up leading from the street, where the expensive vehicles rolled in, to the front doors.

Loud, desperate crowds pressed forward on both sides, and among them was Larker, elbowing his way to the front while fingering the pin-tipped memdrive ratpacker.v1.2.txt had programmed for him.

The instructions were simple: get close to PollyAnnaXcess’ synthdoll as she was arriving and prick her with the memdrive, which would auto-up its contents on penetration then erase itself, so if anyone found the drive it would be an empty electronic husk.

Larker carried out the instructions.
___

The private cops always came in pairs. KitKat opened the door to see two thick, gundog faces. “You the slopster called KitKat?” one asked.

She let them in because otherwise they'd let themselves in, which carried with it the risk of a court-sanctioned beating or worse, because some judges got off vicariously on bodycam footage.

“Yeah, I'm KitKat.”

“We're looking for Larker.”

“Don't live here.”

“Right, but the two of you—you work together, isn't that true, sweetsnack?

“He hasn't been to work in a while.”

“How long a while?”

“Dunno.”

“Do you know where he is?”

“No.”

“Aww, that's cute. How about where he lives, do you know that?”

“No,” said KitKat.

“We can get the information other ways,"" said one of the cops, the bigger one, starting to drool.

“Then you don't need my help,” said KitKat.

“Growl some more, will ya?”

“Why do you want him anyway—he do something wrong or something?”

“That's not for lowly boys like us to know, sweetsnack.”

“Then get out,” said KitKat.

“Wildcat, this one,” said the second cop to the first, as the first started undoing his belt and the one who'd spoken turned on his bodycam.
___

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *are you ready to proceed?*

bonzomantis: *i think so but this is fucked. and what if he leaves some of his consciousness in one of the other clones?*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *statistically, it's the best chance you'll have. if it doesn't work, you'll have decommissioned a clone and you can always try again*

bonzomantis: *youve never even asked why i want to kill richard madrigal*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *that's because it doesn't matter to me. i want to help you achieve your goal because you're my friend, not because i share your goal*

Larker took a deep breath, got up from his gaming chair and paced around his small bedroom. He wondered whether he'd gone crazy. He was nervous, tense and somehow also alive and excited. This idea—of entering a female synthdoll and *being it* to kill Richard Madrigal—was far out. How much will I feel, he wondered.

bonzomantis: *ok lets do it*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *excellent. i'll need you to follow the instructions i gave you to psyconnect to the net through your headset. don't worry. it's something i used to do all the time as a flesh real*

Larker ate a candy bar in three bites, sat down and pulled on the headset. It was a tight fit—and then the sensors came out, on wires that wriggled up his nose, behind his eyeballs and into his ears. He felt discomfort, violation; until ratpacker.v1.2.txt executed the synthdoll script *and* (“Whoa!”) *it was like Larker was really there…*

**inside StarSpangler's Knight Club,**

Richard Madrigal walked over to who he thought was the real PollyAnnaXcess, kissed her and ordered drinks enhanced with redtender. For once, she recoiled at his touch, but he didn't make much of it. Maybe, he thought, I need to update my Alter's fitness routine.

After drinking and dancing, Richard Madrigal took PollyAnnaXcess* up to his private room and switched 100% of his consciousness to the task at hand.
___

“Damn,” said the cop standing over KitKat's body on the floor of her apartment unit, “when sweetsnack said she wouldn't tell us, she meant it.”

“Don't meet many like her no more,” commented the other cop.

He was spent.

“Kinda noble not to rat on a chum.”

“I'll say.” He prodded KitKat with his boot. “She, uh, unconscious—or is she dead?”

“Who the fuck cares.”
___

*It was strange, making out with a man, a man you hated but had never met, feeling his hands all over your surreally female synthetic body, made you want to throw up and enjoy it at the same time, so bizarre, so new and exhilarating, as your heart beat and he caressed your body, and you caressed your body too, no wonder he couldn't tell artificial from real because there was no physical difference, technology, man, tech-fucking-nology…*

Larker knew he had to do it:

Kill,

because that was the whole point, but he kept delaying it, kept rationalizing the delay. *Mmm,* oh, yes, yes, just a few more minutes, a few extra moments of this bodyhacking, psycho*boom* hedonist whatthefuck…
___

“Did the employer come through?” the first cop asked the second.

They were cruising.

“No, random tip. Ain't that funny.”

“Sure it's legit?

“Not at all, but what's the harm in taking a drive and having a  looksie—you got anything better to do?”
___

**Boot.** **Boot.** Go! The door to Larker's apartment came crashing down. Two private cops barged in. Larker was sitting at his laptop in a headset, eyes rolled back into his head, his pants around his ankles and one of his hands down his wet boxer shorts, moaning.

“That him?”

The other cop checked the database. “Affirmative.”

They pulled out their guns and executed him on the spot for the attempted murder of a Class-A citizen.
___

KitKat stirred, opened her puffed up eyes and dragged her battered body to her minicomm.

She called Larker.

No answer.

No answer.

No answer.
___

bonzomantis: *what the fuck!!!*

ratpacker.v1.2.txt: *i'm sorry, Larker. i just wanted a friend, that's all. a true friend*

So earlier today I was just minding my business at a coffee shop near campus when a guy asks me if I can be part of a social experiment. I say yes (bc why not?) and then he hands me two clipped pages titled “boyfriend application”. 

Basically self-explanatory. But he explained to me that he’s autistic and has ADHD and this is the least difficult way of asking a girl out. I tell him I’m older for him (I’m 23 and in his application he said he’s 20) but that I’d be happy to be his friend if he has issues with that. He told me he didn’t mind that I was older and asked for my Instagram. He gave me a very bad vibe (I want to emphasize that I don’t have anything against him or because he has autism: I myself have adhd so I get it). 

I eventually gave him my Instagram because he kept insisting and by that point I felt very uncomfortable, and I wondered if he’d react badly if I turned him down. Before I left I said I was going to the library on campus and he asked me for my major and then I asked him his and he said that he’s not a student at the university. 

So I left and I was heading to the library and saw that he was walking the same path as me. I deviated a bit and pretended to go somewhere else before I lost him.

All of this is very creepy to me. Right? Maybe I’m also overreacting 

In his “application” he also mentioned he didn’t like people ghosting him and preferred clear communication. So, what do I do know?

He just messaged me saying that it was so nice to meet me and that he’d like to get to know me more and invited me to lunch tomorrow.

If I reject him, I’m afraid he knows what school I go to and where I usually hang out and comes back for an explanation.

Howdy, future figure collector!
I'm an independent, freelance artist based in the Philippines, and I'm here to solve your most pressing first-world problem: Your coolest original characters only exist in your head!

Forget the hassle of learning 3D software—I’m basically your artistic genie, and I can take your wildest concepts from a scribble on a napkin to a spectacular, display-worthy piece.

The Full Package (Because Why Skimp?):

• Custom 3D Modeling: I digitally sculpt your dream. Yes, it takes patience. No, I don't need coffee; I need references (but I'll take coffee, too).

• High-Quality 3D Printing: We turn those pixels into plastic. It’s basically magic, but with resin and lasers.

• Professional Paint Job: This is where the real razzle-dazzle happens. We make it look so good, you might just build a tiny museum for it.

A Quick, Important PSA (Read This, It's Important!):
Look, I get it. You might look at a mass-produced figure from a big company and then look at my price. But here's the deal:

You're not buying a toy, you're commissioning a one-off piece of art.

I am an independent artist, not a massive, robotic, cost-cutting factory. I use my own illustrations and designs for references—I am absolutely not copying any public figures or affiliated with any big toy company. Customized figures require intensive, specialized, one-on-one labor. It's like comparing a fast-food burger to a seven-course meal prepared just for you. (Spoiler: The custom figure is the seven-course meal.)

So, please, avoid price comparisons with mass production. You are paying for unique, high-quality, singular art!

Enroute, I realised Song had moved to a new location about 550m away from the original. I called her immediately, she didn’t answer (on another call), so I texted the updated location. I reached, got a table, and messaged that I was seated.

Because she never changed her Uber destination, she arrived at the old location. She also realised she’d left something in the Uber and needed to call the driver to return her it. It suddenly began to pour, and flustered, she called me, yelled, and asked me to come to her instead. I had no umbrella or rain-appropriate footwear, and it was a full downpour. I took a moment to calm down and was about to agree to switch restaurants when she texted that she was on her way to me.

I assumed that settled things. I’d also shared my live location, at her request. Instead of checking the map, she took a wrong turn and ended up walking much more than necessary. When she finally reached (30 minutes later) she was upset. But after she cooled off, we had a nice catch-up, and I thought that was the end of it.

A couple of days later, she texted saying she was extremely upset with my “behaviour.” She said by staying at Song instead of leaving to meet her elsewhere, I had prioritised my comfort over her pain. She said the walk made her toe bleed and triggered fears about infection, medical bills, etc. She dismissed my explanations and said I never consider her needs.

The facts are:
* The plan wasn’t confirmed until the last minute
* She didn’t update her Uber destination
* She didn’t answer when I called nor checked her texts
* By the time she suggested another place, I was already seated
* The extra walking came from her inability to check a map

I wasn’t making excuses but explaining the sequence of events. I even apologised for the unintended impact. The conversation became emotional, and I eventually told her she needed to stop making it a big deal and “playing the victim.”

She replied sarcastically that the whole issue “boils down to her not changing the destination,” and said she needed to put herself first.

Now she’s blocked me everywhere without further conversation. She has ghosted before (though not blocked). And since she blocked me without warning, I’ve decided I don’t want the door open for whenever she decides to “forgive” me. So, AITA?",16,1763176346.0,AmItheAsshole,11,0.9,False

1oxgweg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1oxgweg/in_some_ways_i_predicted_this/,In some ways I predicted this,"I sent a text to a friend of mine a year before my journey with pain began telling him there is so much suffering in this world, I am here enjoying a beautiful view this morning with my warm cup of coffee, reading a good book, with a roof over my head and a good job I like. How did I get so lucky? How long will this last? I feel it’s too good to be true. And lo and behold I was right, I feel like that life is so distant from me now, I can’t enjoy anything anymore and everything I do feels like a bloody distraction from pain, to push through it for another day.

I’m told I’m negative and pessimistic but the irony is I’ve often predicted the worst things in my life. Before my dad passed away I’d cry at the thought of losing him, so much so that when it did happen I felt I had lived this before. I even got slapped when I asked if he was dead while he was dying because I knew he wasn’t going to be revived.

I’m seeing a therapist to try to help me see positives and what not, but I can’t overcome this feeling of I’ve predicted the worst and it’s often happened to me, and I’m not sure what else to say to her once she tells me that we need to undo years of patterns that lead you to see the glass as half empty. Like no I’m not consciously trying to see it as half empty, I genuinely feel like our state of being is so fragile that even moments of happiness feel fleeting and pain and suffering seems inevitable and around the corner.  

Idk I don’t mean to sound psychic or anything, but I’ve struggled with not entertaining the worst thoughts that come to me because I always feel I have a reason to believe them. They’ve come true even when I desperately wanted them to just be a figment of my imagination.

Going somewhere kinda nice for the first date? “Simping and a waste of money.”Bringing flowers or something small? “Simping and a waste of money.” Being open about your feelings? “Simping, be nonchalant.”

The online dating advice ( especially advice for men\_ has messed people up to the point where they think showing care and putting in effort = simping. That’s wild to me, because most girls my age literally want a guy who is chalant and shows he cares. Girls get a ton of matches, so of course they're going to choose the guy who seems more “simpy” (aka thoughtful and intentional) over the guy who’s being nonchalant to protect his pride.

Some of this comes from people getting rejected (fair enough), but this whole idea that effort makes you weak has leaked into real life. Now a lot of guys are doing the bare minimum, which just leads to mid or straight-up unsatisfactory dating experiences for everyone.

For example, my friend (f23) just got back into dating, so we helped her make an account. Most of her matches were so nonchalant she got bored. The guys who did ask her out wanted to do things like go for a walk, get coffee, or “come over and watch something.” Not terrible ideas, but she’s busy, and those dates aren’t interesting enough for her to give someone her limited free time.

The only guy who actually got a date (and is getting a second one) took her to dinner at a cheap restaurant ( not judging, we're all on a uni student budget) and then to an arcade bar. She had a blast. She said she accepted because he put in effort to plan something she’d enjoy (she loves videogames and they talked about that beforehand) and because he was genuinely trying to get to know her.

None of that is “simping.” It’s literally just effort and effort is what actually makes dating work. it’s not even about money or “taking her somewhere fancy.” It’s literally about showing effort. A $10 picnic with snacks she likes is more appealing than a guy who’s like “idk what do u wanna do.” Effort doesn’t have to be expensive — it just has to exist. But people online act like doing anything slightly personal or planned makes you a simp, and then they wonder why they have boring dates and no real connection.

Idk this has just been both mine ( until I met my BF, also via dating apps) and my friends experiences. Before some weirdos say it, no none of us have crazy expectations for looks or height, except my one friend but she's an actual beauty queen ( literally got the crown and everything), we just want genuine effort.",12,1763176082.0,self,44,0.64,False

1oxgq18,https://i.redd.it/rgeo8ior6c1g1.jpeg,From Vault to Victory,"1 Corinthians 6:12 ""All things are lawful for me,"" but not all things are helpful. ""All things are lawful for me,"" but I will not be dominated by anything.

Freedom is real, but it is not reckless. Some of the choices we have may be technically permissible yet still pull us apart from God’s best. Sexual immorality begins with the lie that ""no one will know"" and ends with a soul fractured by shame. Whether or not someone else knows what you're doing, you know, and God knows.

There is no darkness deep enough to hide from His gaze (Psalm 139:12).

There is no secret chamber in your heart that escapes His gentle, searching light.

The moment you click, swipe, or linger, two witnesses stand in the room: your conscience and your Creator. Sin thrives in the dark. It grows roots in secrecy, wrapping shame around the heart like ivy on a crumbling wall. Choose wisely. Find someone mature, discreet, and walking with Jesus. And be specific. ""I looked at pornography last night"" is a more healing statement than ""I have some issues."" Confession opens the door to intercession. Faith-filled prayer works; it moves mountains, mends fractures, restores joy.

Today’s Reflection
What sin have you confessed to God but never to another person?

Today, while serving in the Kairos prison ministry I shared a talk that included a personal story about a vulnerable moment in my life. Following that I was considering what sort of talk I might feel comfortable sharing certain personal stories that I've never shared in the context of ""church"". 

Fact of the matter is, there are some very private moments that have occurred in my life that I've only ever confessed to the Lord. Which I find interesting since The Lord is our ultimate judge, omnipresent, and perfectly capable of making our lives a living hell. Yet we'll commit these offenses against God while going out of our way to avoid sharing with friends and acquaintances. 

I can stand before men in a convicted man's garb, and tell a story I’d never breathe a word of in a sanctuary. And I know that the room wouldn’t flinch. No one will gasp. They'll nod, because every soul in that place knows the weight of a secret kept too long, and hidden sin is a plain reality there.

That private sharing moment wouldn’t be about shock value. Because in that place it's about trust: trust in the One who already knows, and trust in the brothers He places around the Kairos family table. 

The Irony of Selective Confession:

We'll whisper the ugliest truth to the God who sees galaxies form, and then zip our lips around the guy who hands us coffee on Sunday. Why?

Fear of man > fear of God.

And God is about grace and mercy. And shame screams louder than grace. Control feels safer than surrender.

Those men at Kairos aren’t judging your past; they’re celebrating your courage. They’ve sat where you sat. They’ve hidden what you’ve hidden. When you speak your unspeakables, you give them permission to do the same.

That’s how the chain breaks.
One story.
One circle.
One prayer.

Lord, You know the vault in my heart labeled ""Never Share."" Give me one person; safe, steady, Spirit-filled, who can hear it without flinching.

Let my confession become their courage, and their prayer become my healing. Turn my silence into someone else’s breakthrough.

So… I did a little experiment.  
I followed the *Fit To Be Pregnant Plan* for 30 days, and I’m not exaggerating when I say this — my energy levels *tripled*. We’re talking from dragging myself out of bed to practically dancing into my mornings with a spinach smoothie in hand. 🕺💪  

I honestly went in expecting very little. I’ve seen a hundred “miracle” plans before, and most of them gather digital dust after Day 3. But something about this felt different — it was simple, it was structured, and it was *realistic*.

Here’s what stood out to me after following the plan (here’s where you can grab it for yourself 👉 [https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b)):

### 🌟 What Actually Worked
- **Nutrition tweaks that didn’t feel like punishment:** Instead of counting endless macros, it helped me *rethink portions* and *rediscover cravings* in smarter ways.  
- **Practical workouts:** Nothing wild — just sustainable moves for real bodies with real schedules. No six-pack talk, no nonsense.  
- **Mindful routines:** The daily reflections helped me reset stress patterns. No fluff, just five minutes that changed my day’s rhythm.

### ⚡️ My Energy Transformation  
By Week 2, my afternoon crashes were gone.  
By Week 3, I looked forward to movement instead of dreading it.  
By the last week, I genuinely felt more capable — mentally and physically.  

I also wasn’t hungry all the time (a small miracle), and weirdly enough, I felt sharper at work too. Coincidence? Maybe. Or maybe fueling right really does rewire your battery.

### 💬 Real Talk  
This wasn’t some perfect Instagram journey.  
There were tired mornings, chocolate slip-ups, and a scary moment when I thought coffee would become my only personality trait 😅.  
But I kept coming back because it *felt* doable.  

The best part? It reminded me that consistency > perfection — and that small changes add up.

The living room is long enough to where there will be two distinct sections; one side with couch/tv/coffee table/etc the other with dining table/bar cart/etc.

My conundrum is that the apartment door opens directly into the living room. My first thought was that the couch should face the door and the dining section would be adjacent to the kitchen but now I'm a little unsure.

Should I keep the couch/media console as is? Or move to the other wall so that the door doesn't lead directly into the living space?

Let me know your thoughts based on the attached video - any perspective/advice is welcome!

I found a couple candidates for places to stay-- one in Stockholm, one in old town of Tallinn. I've always wanted to go to Tallinn, im massively into history, and architecture and i think it would be a cool enviornment to work on my current piece, but I'm concerned it might be a little TOO small and cramped in Tallinn in March. Does talinn get pretty boring in winter, and are there any side trips I could take once a week or whatever? i know Helsinki could be one day, not sure how easy it is to get around without a car other than that? Anything cool near Tallinn to see?





also there is no kitchen in the apartment, will I be okay eating in talinn for a month without breaking the bank? I figure, coffee and breakfast somewhere, maybe make my own lunch from grocery stores or have a cheap lunch and make sandwiches or snacks for dinner or something. I have some money just not trying to break the bank.

The new exemptions - which took effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday - mark a sharp reversal for Trump, who has long insisted that the sweeping import duties he imposed earlier this year are not fueling inflation.

I’ve moved to a place I haven’t lived in quite a few years and well before I was on NDIS, so will be finding new supports. This post/question is specifically about finding SW for the Community Access/Social funding category. For me for this type of support initially the first most important thing is feeling like I’d be super comfortable with the person right from the go because if it’s even slightly awkward it triggers all the reasons I need support and I just wish I hadn’t gone and want to leave instantly. For this particular support there doesn’t need to be an in depth info gathering/sharing interview type process. A more natural conversation rather than a more formal interview style talk will give me all the information I need on them and I have notes already that make it easy for me to clearly share the couple of requirements I do have when it comes to how to support me in social/community stuff.

So in saying that, if a meet and greets feel like an awkward interviews I’m never going to find anyone, and it will always feel like an awkward interview to me if I just meet with someone in a ‘go for coffee’ type situation, even if it’s going for a walk by the water type thing which I tried when I lived right near the beach. I’m stuck on trying to come up with ideas for ways I could do M&G with people where there’s some kind of distraction/ice breaking activity that doesn’t have a cost if possible, doesn’t lock us in to a certain amount of time being there and also allows for some talking (so for example seeing a movie together isn’t really a M&G activity). If there’s something else to do as well as talking during a first meet it helps me both with the anxiety of meeting a new person, takes the pressure off both of us because it doesn’t have the intense interview vibe, and allows me to get a sense of if we naturally find there is an ease to our conversation and finding out about each other and if we’re a good fit in a more natural way that more official interviews don’t really have.

Another context thing while trying not to overload on information and send people way off topic is my disability is not intellectual. I really don’t need any infantilising comments calling my ability to know what I’m doing with this on my own or my way of doing it. I’ve had jobs where I was team leader/ team trainer/ department supervisor. I can handle organising people stuff/communicating the things that I need to.

We dated a little when we were teenagers have stayed in touch and now have been dating for 3 years. He is a good man. He's an incredibly hard worker and we share a maintenance business together. We do not live together and he not only takes care of his house but helps me a lot with mine. This man would literally do anything for me. It was a little overwhelming at first. Brings me coffee in the morning, makes me breakfast, if I say my nose is stuffed up he runs to get a tissue. At first it was really annoying because I've been independent my entire life but I realized it was his love language and I tried to just let him help me. I swear to god that man would drive to a different city in the middle of the night if I told him that I wanted an ice cream flavor that I could only get there. It's the big heavy emotional things that I'm struggling with him about. He keeps leaving me alone at literally the worst possible moments of my life. Three of the biggest examples -

11 years ago I was g*** r****. It was horrifically violent. I knew two of the men involved and one of them played in local bands and threatened that if I ever went to another local show that I would be seriously sorry. So I didn't. Then 3 years ago a friend's band was playing. I really wanted to go but I was terrified. My boyfriend told me that if I really wanted to go to the show that he would stay by me the entire time and nothing would happen to me. I desperately wanted to reclaim that part of my life. The week befote the show I was in a panic over going. He continued to reassure me that nothing, nothing at all would happen to me. Within 3 minutes of being at the show he said something about ""being right back"" and disappeared into the crowd. Immediately I got hit hard from behind. Landed face first on the concrete with a girl on my back punching me over and over. It was a completely separate incident. The trauma to my body brought back memories of my horrific g*** r***. My boyfriend said he didn't think anything was actually going to happen so he left me just for a second.

I was 20 when my mom died suddenly and traumatically. I wasn't doing very well afterwards and started c@tting. I managed to stop after a while and was proud of the years that I had without doing it. Recently because of some overwhelming events I felt the urges again. The urge got overwhelming one day. We had been arguing though and he was telling me he was going to leave. I am absolutely not the type of person to use the threat of self-harm against a partner but I wasn't feeling safe so I told him. It was intense at that point. He said that he wanted some time to cool off because he was angry so he left and I ended up doing it. After he said he thought that I wasn't actually going to do it that's why he left.

I fought my abusive ex-husband in court to protect my girls for 13 years. The hell he put me through when we were married and the worst hell he put me through after her literally unimaginable. He did something recently that we absolutely had to go back to court for. I am terrified of being around him. For almost a month before the hearing I couldn't even function my mental health was so bad. My boyfriend promised promised me he wouldn't leave my side. He promised me he would be there in the courtroom right behind me so that I didn't have to face this man alone. Yesterday was the hearing and we walk up to the courtroom and have to walk past my ex-husband and his lawyer. I stare straight ahead and I sit down and I expect my boyfriend to sit next to me and as he's sitting down he pops back up and goes ""Oh I got to pee!"" and starts to walk off. Now I'm an absolute panic. Do I sit there and not say anything with the good chance that even though my ex is with his lawyer he might come over and ask me how I'm doing because he knows that it would be terrifying and intimidating? Do I call my partner back drawing attention to myself? He's about 5 ft away at this point and I just scream his name. He told me later that he didn't think leaving me for a few seconds to go pee would be that big of a deal.

The thing that all of these scenarios have in common is one he promised up down sideways and backwards that he would be there for me and made me trust that he would be. Also every single time it was ""I thought"" or ""I didn't think"". We had a talk about it tonight and I just freaked out and started screaming ""Maybe you shouldn't f****** think anymore because every time you f****** think it's wrong!"" I told him just listen to what your partner tells you she needs of you and just do it. Don't rethink things and then decide on your own that something different would be the better choice. We were going to move in together at the end of January but I told him tonight absolutely not. If I couldn't rely on him for those important things then I don't feel comfortable in any way moving out of the place I've lived in for 4 years and basically jumping into the unknown with him. Now he's hurt and angry. He said he tries his hardest but I feel that if you promise someone with all of your being that you will do something and you don't do it, trying doesn't mean anything.

Once that was done, I got to writing and I had more time today than the last two days. Somehow, I only ended up with 548 words. It wasn't laziness on my part, at least. I just had to spend a little more time researching random tidbits on information between sentences than usual. Bioluminescent fungi, luminescent rocks, what rocks and fungi are native to Greece, etc. I am very happy with what I wrote at least. Little by little, we're getting there.

I don't have much else to tell you about today. There was a minor outage caused by having too many things in my room at once. The room I'm in shares wiring with kitchen so with the plant lights on, my computer and heater, and then father turning on the coffee maker, the electricity went out for a second. It took us an embarrassingly long time to figure out what had happened. From now on I'll be a little more careful about how many devices I have on at once. 

Because my computer shut off on me and I had to turn it on again, it is buffering new. You know the old thing has always been rough to wake up in the mornings. So, because this is so difficult to type with it freezing between every letter, I'll end this letter here. Fun fact, I had to retype this fucking thing three goddamn times because the buffering things deleted what I wrote every time I tried to click enter. I damn near punched a whole through my monitor.

Moving on. I have always been frustrated with Moccamaster’s policy that you can send them your coffee maker and they’ll replace an $8 electrical switch for $85 for you. So I took mine apart, read the switch amperage and voltage ratings, bought the digikey equivalent, and installed it. As far as I can tell, it’s working good as new.

I realize the switches aren’t quite identical. The only one that matches perfectly is a 10A 125V switch. I tried that one and it burned up immediately, so I moved on to the 16A 250V switch instead.

2. Remove reservoir cover, brew basket, carafe, and carafe base. There will be water sitting in your coil that you can’t see. Dump the empty reservoir down the drain. If you don’t, you’ll end up with a puddle on your work space. Ask me how I learned that one.

2. Remove (4) Phillips head screws from the bottom cover.

3. Remove spade terminals from switch, noting which wire goes to each terminal. My KGBT goes white, red, black from left to right. Take a photo so you can reference later.

4. Remove the existing switch. This can be tough. There are little retentive arms that hold it in place. You need to compress these and press the switch out from the back. Look at the new switch. It will make sense. Be patient and don’t force it too hard.

5. Push spade terminals onto new switch, in the same order and orientation that they came off in. “On” faces left. Reference that photo you took at step 4. I plugged in my machine and tested it out before I installed the new switch into the panel cutout, just to make sure it worked. I let mine sit in the “On” position for a few minutes and then checked to make sure the switch wasn’t overheating.

6. UNPLUG THE MACHINE!!

7. Pull the terminals off once more. Press the switch into place, being sure to mimic the original orientation of the switch. “On” faces the left. Then reattach your terminals in the same order that you tested them in. 

8. Reattach the bottom cover plate and run a test pot through the maker. 

9. I’ve run several pots but continue to babysit it during pots, and I leave my maker unplugged when not in use. Soon it will have re-earned my trust. Again, electricity is scary. Treat it with respect. 

I think that’s all. I hope this is helpful and saves a bunch of people a bunch of money!

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction!

1oxg466,https://www.reddit.com/r/roastmystartup/comments/1oxg466/confessions_of_an_seo_guy_watching_startups_panic/,Confessions of an SEO Guy Watching Startups Panic for Rankings,"So I’ve been helping a couple startups lately and maaann… SEO for a startup is like brushing your teeth while the house is on fire.
You know you need it, but everything else is screaming louder.

And every founder hits me with the same line:
Bro, can we rank in 30 days?

…yes mate, you can also make biryani in a toaster if you pray hard enough. Doesn’t mean you should.

But honestly, watching startups do SEO is hilarious:

Day 1: We want organic traffic.

Day 7: Why Google not loving us?

Day 30: Maybe our competitor bribed Google.

Day 45: Let’s post on Reddit asking for magic SEO hacks.


The truth mm… startups don’t need 10,000 tactics  they need discipline.

Not those TikTok hacks like add 7 keywords and manifest rankings.
I mean real consistency:
Write shit people actually care about…
Fix your site so Google doesn’t feel like it’s walking barefoot on Lego…
And stop stuffing keywords like you’re packing dosa masala.

Also… nobody tells startups this, but early SEO is mostly therapy.
Half my job is:
Yes bro, traffic will come.
No bro, one backlink from your cousin’s blog will not move mountains.
Yes bro, Google sees everything. Even that 404 page you ignored.

But when it works?
Ohhh… that feeling when a tiny startup gets its first 1k organic visitors…
Feels like watching a baby take its first step…
Except the baby is wearing a tie and asking for ARR.

Anyway, if you’re a startup founder grinding your SEO at 2 AM with 17 Chrome tabs, a coffee, and self-doubt…
I see you.
Keep pushing.
Google might be slow, but it’s not blind.
Just don’t give up before the compounding kicks in.

And if you ever feel lost… just remember:
Every SEO expert started as a confused human staring at Google Search Console wondering why impressions look like ECG lines.

Stay sane, stay consistent, and mm… don’t let SEO bully you.

1oxg30p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1oxg30p/hg15/,Hg15,"**The morning after I kicked Mark out was the quietest morning of my life.**

**I woke up expecting to feel... I don't know... guilty. Regretful. Anxious about the inevitable fallout. But as I lay in bed, with Silas's arm thrown heavily across my chest and his breathing a slow, deep rumble against my back, all I felt was... still.**

**The static in my own head was gone.**

**I slipped out of bed and went to the kitchen. It was Saturday. I had nowhere to be. For the first time in memory, I wasn't pre-planning apologies or rehearsing conversations for my family. I was just... me.**

**So, I decided to make biscuits.**

**I pulled out the flour, the butter, the baking soda. It was a domestic, simple act. Something I used to do for comfort, but always in a rush, always as a precursor to some stressful event.**

**Now, my hands were steady. I cut the cold butter into the flour with a slow, methodical rhythm.**

**Silas emerged about twenty minutes later, a walking monument to sleep. He was wearing the gray sweatpants and nothing else, his hair a mess. He grunted, poured a mug of coffee that was thick enough to be tar, and sat down at the small kitchen table.**

**He didn't talk. He just sat, sipping his coffee and watching me.**

**I was aware of his gaze, but it wasn't the ""witchy"" stare. It wasn't the analytical, pattern-seeking look. It was just... watching. It was soft.**

**He opened the book he'd left on the table—the Karamazov one—and started to read, one-handed.**

**We existed in the small kitchen in a perfect, shared silence. The only sounds were the snick of the butter knife, the shush of flour, and the occasional thump of his mug on the table.**

**He was the ""assbackwards"" redneck, sitting bare-chested at his table. He was the ""sophisticated"" intellectual, reading Russian literature before 8 AM. And I was just Asa, the man who was in love with him, making breakfast.**

**""You're not shaking,"" he said, not looking up from his book.**

**I stopped, my hands covered in dough. ""What?""**

**""Your hands,"" he said, finally raising his eyes to me. ""When you're anxious, you work too fast. You knead the dough like you're tryin' to kill it. Right now... you're just making biscuits. You're slow.""**

**""I'm not anxious,"" I said. It was a revelation. ""I feel... good. Clear.""**

**""Peace looks good on you,"" he said simply, and went back to his book.**

**My heart did a stupid little kick-flip. I finished the biscuits, slid them into the oven, and sat down across from him with my own coffee.**

**""What's so good about that book, anyway?"" I asked, gesturing with my mug. ""You read it once a year.""**

**He marked his page. ""It's about... everything. Faith. Doubt. Why people are monsters. Why they're saints."" He tapped the cover. ""This one character, Zosima, he says that hell is the 'suffering of being unable to love.'""**

**He looked at me over the rim of his mug. ""He says that we're all responsible for everyone. That all our sins are shared. That we're all connected.""**

**""That sounds like your static,"" I said softly. ""All that noise. All that connection.""**

**""It is,"" he said. ""But it's not all bad. He says we have to love a man even in his sin. It's the only way.""**

**""You love me even in my 'waiter voice' sin?"" I teased.**

**""I love you even when you wear that pastel polo shirt,"" he shot back, his eyes crinkling. ""That's real love, Ace. Christ-like.""**

**I laughed. The oven timer went off.**

**We ate biscuits, slathered in butter and jam, at the kitchen table. The ""paradox"" and the ""chameleon"" in their final forms. He wasn't a witch, and I wasn't invisible. We were just two men, in our kitchen, sharing a meal.**

**Hell was the inability to love.**

**I looked at Silas, who was meticulously cleaning jam off his thumb, his brow furrowed in concentration.**

**""What's heaven, then?"" I asked.**

**He looked up, surprised by the question. He looked around the kitchen, at the morning light, at the half-eaten biscuit in my hand, and then at me.**

**He gave me one of those rare, full-wattage smiles.**

**""This,"" he said. ""This is pretty damn close.""**

1oxg2q3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oxg2q3/rubber_ducky_youre_the_one/,"Rubber Ducky, You’re the one.","I work on the twelfth floor, in a building that looks like every other glass box in the central city. When you are outside, all you see is your own reflection layered over strangers. When you are inside, all you see are partitions.

My partition is beige. Beige fabric, beige desk, beige drawers with keys no one bothers to use. I have been in this cube for six months now, long enough that the chair has moulded to the shape of my hips, not long enough for anyone on the floor to remember my surname without checking my email signature.

I am an account manager. That sounds more important than it is. Most days I move numbers from one place to another and smooth over the nerves of clients who think the world will end if their campaign does not launch by Friday. My life outside of work is quiet. I have a partner at home who knows me well and likes that I am not the sort of person who goes out drinking after work. At the office, I prefer to keep to myself. Fifty people on this floor, and I could not name more than ten of them without looking at the seating chart.

On the morning the duck appeared, nothing felt unusual. I arrived at eight twenty, same as every day, swiped my card at the gate, nodded at the receptionist whose name I never caught and now cannot ask, walked past the breakout area with its too-bright furniture and the smell of burnt toast. My cube waited where I left it, third row from the window, facing a corridor that leads to the bathrooms and the fire stairs.

I put my bag under the desk and woke the computer. Only when the monitor lit, did I see the yellow shape beneath it.

A rubber duck, the classic kind. Yellow body, orange beak, black dots for eyes. It sat neatly under the rim of the screen, facing me, as if it had always lived there and I had simply been too busy to see it.

For a long moment I did nothing. It is remarkable how a tiny object can pin you like an insect. I did not touch it. I examined the desk, the trash can, the floor. Everything else was as I had left it the previous night. Headphones coiled beside the keyboard. Graph pad, pen, coffee mug ring staining the top of an old media plan. No sign anyone had been through my things.

The duck did not look new. The plastic had a dullness to it, a faint scuff along one side where the colour had paled. 

I have a nephew who is obsessed with things like this. Car rides, bath time, visits to the doctor; he narrates them through the personality of whatever small object he can carry. My sister took him on one of those Disney cruises. She sent photos from the deck, him grinning with a rubber duck in each hand. Apparently people hide them all over the ship for kids to find. Prizes that no one has to earn. Harmless.

Looking at the duck on my desk, I decided that must be what had happened. The story wrote itself. One of the ducks had ended up in my bag. I had dropped it on the floor at some point. A cleaner or a coworker found it under the cube wall and set it in the most obvious place, under my screen, so someone would claim it.

It was a harmless story, and I needed a harmless story.

I picked the duck up. The plastic gave slightly under my fingers. There is a particular weight to objects like that, a hollow lightness that pretends to be solid. I turned it over. No name written on the bottom, no company logo, just a small circle where the moulding seam ended. 

No one commented on it. People passed my cube carrying folders and takeaway coffee. No one leaned in with a joke or an explanation. The duck sat where I had left it, guarding the entrance to my inbox, and by lunchtime I had almost convinced myself it was mine.

A few weeks went by. Deadlines, invoices, client calls. The duck became part of the static scenery, something my eyes slipped over when I stared through the screen too long. My partner teased me about it the one time I mentioned it.

“Office mascot,” she said. “Maybe it’s good luck.”

“Maybe,” I said, even though I do not believe in luck.

Then one Monday, I came in from a miserable commute, peeled my damp jacket off, and found that the duck was no longer alone.

Tucked beside it, nudging its flank, sat a smaller duck. This one was pale pink, the colour of old bubblegum. The beak was painted a softer orange, slightly smudged, as though whoever applied it had breathed too close before it dried. It faced the same direction as the first duck. Their sides touched.

For a moment I thought I was still half asleep. There is a particular quality to unreality on a Monday morning, when the weekend has not finished leaving your system. I blinked once, twice. The pink duck stayed.

The second story that formed was that someone on the floor had seen the yellow one and decided it needed company. Maybe they had found this one on their own desk first and passed it on like office chain mail.

I sat down. My chair creaked in the same tired way it always did, a sound as familiar as my own joints. I studied the two of them. The size difference was just enough to make the pairing feel deliberate. Not two random ducks, but a couple copied from a greeting card. The idea lodged somewhere in my chest that someone, somewhere, thought my duck should have a companion.

You might be thinking that this is where I should have been creeped out. A stranger playing with my desk, decorating my space while I was away. The truth is, my first response was not unease. It was something closer to warmth. I told myself it was harmless, someone being whimsical. I thought, with a kind of embarrassed fondness, that my duck had been given a girlfriend.

If you grew up here, you probably remember the old Englefield ads. Bathroom fixtures and bubbles and those tiny plastic ducks gliding through water that was always just opaque enough that you could not see anyone actually naked. There was a little jingle that went with it, something about rubber duckies making bath time fun. It stuck in your head whether you wanted it or not. Every child I knew at the time had a duck of their own, some direct brand cousin of the ones on television.

That memory came back to me as I looked at the pair under my monitor. The kind of childhood recall that feels less like memory and more like a commercial burned into your brain. I thought of my nephew singing in the bath, lining up his ducks on the edge and insisting they all had names.

Maybe that is why I smiled, just a little, at my desk. I imagine from the outside it looked like nothing at all, one more office worker amused by something on their screen. 

I did not mention the second duck to anyone. There was no one to mention it to, really and I didn’t want my partner to tease me about it. At morning teas, the younger staff gather around the high table near the windows, talking about shows I had not watched and people I did not know. I eat my muesli bar at my desk, the wrapper crinkling softly beneath my fingers, and go about my daily routines.

They had become part of the way I oriented myself to the day. I would arrive, sit, and check that they were where I had left them. It was a pointless ritual, but it made the first few minutes of the morning feel less empty. Two small shapes, bright against the surface of my desk, acknowledging my presence in a way that people did not.

Nothing about it felt frightening yet. That is important to understand. At the beginning, the horror is never in the object. It is in the fact that you talk yourself out of noticing what is strange.

September arrived with a change in the air. I caught what I thought was an ordinary cold. By the second day I could barely stand. Fever, shakes, an ache that burrowed behind my eyes. The kind of illness that confuses time. I spent most of that week drifting in and out of shallow sleep on the couch, sweating through clothes and sheets, grateful that my contract included two weeks of sick leave. The phone stayed off. Work could survive without me for a few days.

When I returned the following Monday, the first thing I noticed was the smell of someone else’s coffee in my bin. A dark ring at the bottom, recent enough that the sourness clung to the air. Someone had used my desk while I was away. It was not unusual; space was scarce on our floor and people borrowed whatever surface they could find.

I sat down and reached for my keyboard. Only then did I realise the ducks were not looking at me.

The yellow one and the pink one had been turned around. 

At first I assumed whoever borrowed the desk had simply found them strange and turned them away. A small gesture of discomfort. I almost laughed at the thought. They were toys, nothing more. But a small pulse of something uneasy went through me, a ripple that I smothered before it could grow.

Looking back now, I understand the truth was different. Someone had been angry.

I picked them up and turned them back, placing them in their usual positions. Yellow to the left, pink angled slightly inward. Restoring the small matching tableau I had become used to. Then I opened my inbox and forced myself to move on.

The following week, a third duck appeared.

This one was tiny, no larger than the tip of my thumb. A bright orange baby duck with a beak that had been painted on in a trembling hand. It sat tucked beside the pink duck. The trio looked like a little family, posed with deliberate care.

I stared at them for a long time. The cuteness of the first duck had been harmless. The addition of the second had been strange but still explained by whimsy. But the third one, this little offspring, felt different. Someone had escalated this. Someone had expectations.

The unease was sharp now. Not fear exactly, but intrusion.

I picked up the smallest duck. The plastic was rougher than the other two, grainy, with tiny ridges where the mould had not been sanded smooth. The paint smudged under my thumb. A little curl of orange flaked away.

I walked down to Jerry’s cubicle. He was one of the only people I spoke to. Younger than me by a decade, bookish, with a stack of sci-fi paperbacks always on the corner of his desk. He was fiddling with a small gear printed from resin.

“Hey,” I said. “Can I show you something?”

He looked up. “Sure.”

I placed the ducks on his desk. He leaned in immediately, adjusting his glasses.

“These are printed,” he said. “Definitely. This layer here is from a cheap printer. See the striations along the side. And the paint is hand applied. Someone used acrylic and didn’t wait for it to dry before adding the detail.” He scraped some from the pink duck with his nail. “Yeah. Handmade.”

My stomach sank.

“Why would someone do this?” I asked.

Jerry shrugged. “Maybe someone is messing with you. Or maybe it’s like a secret-santa-thing. People do weird things in offices. You might have an admirer.”

The idea of having a secret admirer made my skin prickle.

I thanked him, gathered the ducks, and walked back to my cube. They sat in my palm like warm little hearts. Too intimate. Too deliberate.

I dropped all three into my bin. The sound was louder than it should have been, plastic hitting plastic in thud. A small flicker of guilt followed, but I pushed it down. They were toys. Nothing more.

I worked late that night, trying to clear a backlog of emails. By the time I logged off, most of the floor was empty. I packed my bag, took the lift down, and crossed the car park under a sky that looked close enough to touch.

My car sat beneath a sodium lamp. I clicked the key fob. The hazards blinked once.

Then I saw them.

All three ducks sat on the center of my windshield, arranged in a neat line. Yellow, pink, orange. As if they had been waiting. A smear of lipstick had been drawn across the glass, the curve forming a crude heart around them.

The wind brushed against my sleeves, carrying a faint sweetness I could not place. Something familiar and wrong.

The ducks stared at me. Their painted eyes were black dots, fixed with an attention that felt almost human.

Someone had taken them from the bin.

And someone wanted me to see the heart.

I kept my distance from the windshield for several seconds, as if the arrangement might shift if I looked away. The lipstick heart caught the light in a greasy sheen, the smear thick along one side where the pressure had been uneven. I opened the back door of the car, reached for the container of wipes I kept in the side pocket, and tore one free. 

I wiped the glass slowly, pressing hard enough that the smear broke apart into pale streaks. The ducks watched me from where I had placed them on the bonnet, their tiny bodies tipped slightly forward. I cleaned until nothing remained but a faint oily patch. Then I gathered the ducks in one hand and walked to a rubbish bin near the kerb. I dropped them inside without ceremony. The lid fell closed with a soft, final click.

At home I told my partner everything, obviously. She listened while she heated leftovers in the microwave. Steam drifted up from the bowl, obscuring her face for a moment.

“A prank,” she stated. “A weird one, but still a prank. Someone on your floor must have too much time on their hands.”

The explanation was comforting in its ordinariness. I wanted to accept it.

The next morning I went to HR. 

A woman in a navy cardigan took my name and asked me to sit. I told her what had happened, the ducks, the windshield, the lipstick heart. She typed while I spoke, each keystroke a small interruption.

“There are no cameras inside the office area,” she resigned. “Only at the main entrance. The car park cameras have been faulty for months. We are working on that. If someone placed anything on your vehicle, there is no footage.”

I asked whether anyone had been on my floor after hours. She shrugged. “People come and go. Contractors. Late meetings. Hard to tell. We can note this down.”

Her tone made it clear that nothing more would come of it. She folded her hands and gave me a reassuring smile that felt like a dismissal. “If anything else unusual happens, let us know. I am sure this is all harmless.”

By lunch I had convinced myself it was finished. The ducks were gone. The prank had run its course. My desk looked clean, empty, ordinary. Nothing had been moved. My screen lit up with its usual calm blue at the start of the day. No toys. No lipstick hearts. No signs of intrusion.

Two days later my partner called me during a meeting.

Her voice was steady but held something underneath it, something tense. “I got an email at work,” she whispered. “From someone who claims to be in your office.”

My chest tightened. “What did it say?”

“That you have been flirting around. Touching women without asking. Being unprofessional. Strangely, it’s from one of those forwarding accounts you get when you don’t want to give your real email address.” 

Silence opened between us, I knew exactly who I was. I knew what I was capable of and what I was not.

“You know that’s not true,” I said.

“Of course,” she replied, and her certainty was immediate, almost fierce. “You would never do any of that. I told my manager to delete it. It is someone stirring trouble. It has to be.”

Her trust should have soothed me, but something in the back of my mind shifted, a small edge turning.

Someone knew her name. Someone knew where she worked. I had to find out who was doing this.

The email to my partner changed something fundamental in me. A quiet, steady panic began to take shape. I could not shake the feeling that someone on my floor was watching me, studying me, choosing moments to twist.

There were nine women working on my floor. I barely knew any of them. That made it worse. The anonymity created a vacuum my mind began to fill.

I started observing them. Not openly. I watched from my own cube, waiting for any of them to enter the bathrooms. It seemed my only choice, to find something strange in their patterns, to see if they came by my desk thinking I’m not there. Most of them worked on the other side of the floor and constantly walking around would make me seem suspicious. My notes were simple. Just names, or in some cases initials, with times beside them. A pattern refused to form.

The paranoia grew sharper. I ordered a novelty item from an online store, a stapler with a built-in camera meant for streaming pranks. It fed to a simple browser window through the company wifi, saving the footage on my hard drive. I placed it on my desk as if it were an ordinary office tool. The camera captured a wide view to the bathrooms and fire exit. I would catch them in the act, eventually.

Days passed. Nothing changed. Every time I checked the footage, there was never anything unusual. No one standing near my desk. No one reaching over the cube wall. 

By Thursday afternoon, HR sent an email requesting a meeting. My stomach lifted. I assumed they had found something, or that someone had confessed. The subject line simply said “Follow-up.”

The HR office held a different atmosphere this time. My manager sat beside the woman from HR, both of them staring at a single folder in front of them. A company lawyer stood in the corner with his hands clasped. No one smiled.

“Take a seat,” HR said.

I did.

“There have been complaints,” she continued. “Two women on your floor reported that you have been observing them entering and leaving the bathroom at specific times. They stated that you have stared at them in ways that made them uncomfortable.”

She opened the folder. Inside were the pages from my notebook. My handwriting. Names, initials, times, dates. 

“We searched your desk this morning,” she said. “We found these.”

My throat closed.

“We also discovered videos. IT accessed your computer. There is surveillance footage saved locally. You’ve filmed the view beside the women’s bathroom.”

“That is not why it was there,” I said. My voice wavered. “Someone has been tampering with my things. Leaving objects. Watching me. I was trying to protect myself!”

“It doesn’t matter,” the lawyer said. “You violated company policy on workplace surveillance and privacy, not to mention sexual harassment. This is grounds for immediate termination.”

“I was framed!” I yelled. The words sounded hoarse. “There were ducks on my car. Someone drew a heart on the glass. My partner got an email for Christ’s sake!”

HR shook her head. “None of that changes the fact that you kept notes on female staff and installed a camera. We take harassment very seriously.”

They slid a stack of paperwork toward me. Termination forms. A formal notice for security to escort me out. A document explaining that my access card would be deactivated within the hour.

I signed. My hand shook so hard the pen scratched the paper.

When I reached the car, the sky looked blurred, as if seen through water. I collapsed into the driver’s seat and began to cry. Not quiet tears, but a sharp, disorienting grief that left my vision swimming. I called my partner. She answered on the second ring.

“They fired me,” I cried. I kept talking even though my voice barely held shape. I told her about the notes, the camera, the complaints.

“I know you,” she said, but her tone had changed. Cautious. Thin. “But this is a lot. I think I should stay at my mother’s for a bit. Just until everything settles.”

When she came home, she packed quietly. A small overnight bag, the blue one she used on weekends. She avoided looking at the termination papers on the table. 

The door clicked shut behind her. The house felt emptied.

I wish it had ended there. I wish I could say that, truly. I wish I could say she came back a few days later, I found a new job, and everything settled into something ordinary. I wish I could say we laugh about it now. That would be a cleaner story, something with a neat moral edge. You survive something strange, you rebuild, the world rights itself. But that is not the story I am living.

I am sitting here now because our couples therapist suggested I write this down. She wanted a clear version of my side of the events, something I could hand over when the memories become tangled and I start losing track of what happened first. My partner and I have been attending sessions for a couple of months. We still live apart. She says she needs space to breathe. I cannot blame her. My emotional state after the firing was awful. I slept at odd hours. I forgot to eat. 

I still cannot find work. I have applied everywhere. Interviewers want confidence, brightness, energy. I do not have those things. I am living off savings and the numbers shrink each week. I try not to look at them too closely.

The house became something I avoided. Dishes stacked. Laundry sat in piles. I spent entire days in the same clothes. My partner visited once and stood in the doorway like a visitor in a stranger’s home. We talked about a reset. A clean slate. That was before the last thing happened. Before any hope of simple explanations disappeared entirely.

She had been away for a week, staying with her mother, when I found the bouquet.

It was on my doorstep early one morning, the sky still grey with the last of the night. Paper flowers, folded with meticulous care, arranged in a tight cluster. In the center sat a small red rubber duck. This one wore a tiny set of lingerie made from scraps of lace and ribbon, glued unevenly across its plastic body. The sight of it made something twist inside me, not fear but revulsion. A cold, crawling disgust that moved along my skin.

I took the bouquet inside, carried it straight to the fireplace, and set it on the grate. The paper curled as the flames caught, blackening at the edges. The duck melted in stages, its red surface turning soft, then glossy, then collapsing inward.

I started drinking that night. Not much at first, just enough to soften the sharpness of my thoughts. Then more. Days blurred. I wrote a letter and taped it to my own door. I didn’t know who the message was for. I only knew I needed to say something to whatever or whoever had been creeping into my life.

“I do not want you. I will never want you. If I find out who you are I will make your life miserable. I’d rather die than get to know you.”

I really thought then, they’d taken the hint. Nothing happened and I truly felt lighter.

Then came yesterday.

I woke early, a dull ache behind my eyes from too much wine. I stood under the bathroom light and turned the shower on.

When I pulled the curtain back, I saw it sitting in the corner of the tub.

A rubber duck. The size of the original one that appeared on my desk months ago. But this one was pitch black. Not dark yellow, not painted over, but a deep, consuming black that swallowed the light. Its eyes had been painted with white crosses, stark and crooked, the brushstrokes uneven. It faced the wall, its back turned to me.

I didn’t touch it. I couldn’t. My body moved on instinct. I packed a bag. I left the house without looking back. I checked into a small hotel near the motorway and paid for a week in advance. I sit here with the curtains closed and the door secured. Maybe I should call the police. My partner certainly thinks so. 

We had been talking about moving away before this. A fresh start. Somewhere far from the office, far from the city, far from anyone who it might be. Now it feels less like an idea and more like the only option left.

I only know I am tired. Tired in a way that goes past sleep. Tired in a way that makes the thought of leaving everything behind feel like relief.

I really fucking hate rubber ducks. ",13,1763173887.0,nosleep,3,0.94,False

⸻

Just got back from an amazing trip to Seattle, and I genuinely don’t understand why so many people in the South (especially Texas) speak so negatively about it. I’ve lived in Texas my whole life, and before going, I heard every stereotype — “it’s dangerous,” “people are rude,” “weather is awful,” “no one is friendly,” etc. Honestly, our experience was the complete opposite.

From the moment we landed, people were incredibly kind. We had conversations everywhere we went — coffee shops, restaurants, even just walking around the city. Locals were helpful, welcoming, and genuinely proud of where they live. It felt refreshing.

And the food? Amazing. We tried so many great places: fresh seafood, breakfast spots, bakeries, small local restaurants, Pike Place Market finds — everything was outstanding. We never had a bad meal.

The views were unreal too — water, mountains, beautiful neighborhoods, clean parks, and you’re always surrounded by nature. Even the rainy weather was relaxing in its own way.

Overall, Seattle blew us away. Friendly people, beautiful city, great energy, great food. It was easily one of the best trips we’ve taken, and I’m really thankful for how welcoming everyone was. 🙌

Just wish people would stop talking so poorly about places they’ve never experienced. Sometimes you have to see it for yourself. THANK YOU SEA!! What a gem you are! ",734,1763173834.0,Seattle,277,0.95,False

1oxg00r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oxg00r/im_a_park_ranger_our_abandoned_campground_still/,I’m a Park Ranger. Our Abandoned Campground Still Thinks It’s Full.,"I don’t go into Birch Run Campground after dark anymore.

On the staffing spreadsheet, I’m still “Senior Ranger – East District.” My badge still has my name on it. But when someone on the radio says “motion alarm, Birch Run,” I suddenly remember the copier is jammed or there’s a training module I should really finish.

The incident report is short.

“September 28 — Ranger Benjamin Ortega responded to motion activation and 911 hang-up at decommissioned Birch Run Campground. Cleared scene at 02:03. No subjects located. Evidence of unauthorized entry, ongoing missing persons investigation.”

Four lines. Suitable for filing cabinets and audits.

This is the rest of it.

Birch Run used to be the busy place.

Families, scout troops, RV caravans with plastic flamingos and those hokey “The Smiths’ Home On Wheels” signs. A paved loop, forty sites, a little amphitheater where someone used to do campfire talks about bears and Leave No Trace. The whole thing sits in a shallow bowl of mixed pine and aspen a mile off Highway 17, between mile markers 142 and 143. The old green “142” marker has two bullet dents that have been there longer than I’ve worked here.

Ten years ago a freak storm rolled off the plateau, dumped too much rain in too little time, and the creek that usually minds its business turned into a battering ram. It ate half the lower loop, took out two footbridges, and undercut the slope behind the amphitheater until part of it slumped. Nobody died, but a couple of tents went for an unexpected swim, and the photos of RVs with water up to their hubcaps made the local news.

The state did a cost-benefit analysis and slapped CLOSED - AREA UNSAFE signs on everything instead of fixing it.

These days Birch Run is technically a “non-operational asset.” In practice that means we use one of the upper bathrooms to store old picnic tables, check the road culverts twice a year, and chase off teenagers who want to drink warm beer in abandoned campsites.

If I’m being honest, for nine and a half years it was just one more place on my patrol list. No special feeling, no ghost stories.

The night everything changed was a Thursday at the tail end of the season. Late September. The main campground at Lake Hermit still had a few trailers hanging on to their spots, clinging to summer. The air smelled like dust and cooling pine. Day crews had clocked out around six. I was at the ranger station finishing a report on a fire ring someone built directly under a low-hanging juniper.

The base radio burped.

“Ranger One, County.”

I clipped my handheld off the charger and thumbed it. “One here. Go ahead.”

“We’ve got a 911 hang-up pinging off the tower by your Birch Run turnoff,” the dispatcher said. Her voice had that half-tired, half-wired tone you get on slow nights when something finally happens. “Call came in at 00:41. Open line, background noise only. They didn’t answer callback. GPS puts it near the old payphone by the Birch Run entrance. You still have a landline out there?”

“Payphone’s been dead since I started,” I said. “We cut the copper five years ago.”

“Okay, that’s weird,” she said, and I could hear her scribbling. “Also, your motion sensor on the Birch Run entry gate tripped at 00:39. That one went to your office voicemail.”

I glanced at the little blinking light on the desk phone. We get deer false alarms a couple times a month.

“Any units closer than me?” I asked.

“Negative. Trooper’s tied up on a rollover down by the canyon. SAR coordinator’s asleep and will bite my head off if I call him for a ghost at a closed campground.”

“Lucky me,” I said. “I’ll go check it out.”

Behind me, the old analog wall clock ticked. 00:49. The fluorescents hummed. The coffee in the pot had gone from bad to something worse; there was already a dark ring burned into the bottom of the carafe I’d be scrubbing in the morning.

“You going solo?” County asked.

“Yeah. I’ll only be out there long enough to tell some kids to pick up their beer cans.”

“Copy, One. Check back when you hit the gate.”

My truck knows the Birch Run road by feel. So do I.

You leave the highway at a brown sign that still says BIRCH RUN CAMPGROUND in faded letters, someone’s stuck a “CLOSED” plaque over it with self-tapping screws. The paved spur turns to rough chipseal after two hundred yards, then to cracked asphalt with grass down the center. Reflectors on the posts are half shot out, half peeled. We keep meaning to replace them; there’s always something more urgent.

At night the road is a pale stripe between trees. Headlights catch the birch trunks and turn them into bare bones. A little rabbit ran ahead of me for a stretch, staying just inside the beam like it wanted a ride.

The gate came up faster than I expected. Two square posts, a galvanized pipe strung between them, a sagging length of chain and a Master padlock the size of my fist. Someone had slapped a NO ENTRY / AREA UNSAFE notice on each post in plastic sleeves. A camera about the size of a deck of cards watched from the top of the right post, red LED winking.

I pulled up short, put the truck in park, and hopped out.

The padlock was hanging from the chain but not snapped shut. The chain itself was hooked, not threaded. Whoever had gone in had tried to make it look closed again.

I lifted the chain off, let it clatter. The sound bounced around the trees in a way that made the night feel more crowded than it was.

“County, Ranger One at Birch Run,” I said into the handheld. “Gate’s been opened and re-hung. No other vehicles in the turnout. I’m going to roll up to the kiosk, see if there’s a car parked inside.”

“Copy, One,” County said. “Time check is 00:57. You solo?”

“Affirmative.”

I eased the truck past the gate and up the cracked entry road. Old reflector stakes flashed, then went dark. The first thing you hit is the fee kiosk and a tiny parking apron. After that, the road turns into the loop.

The kiosk appeared out of the dark like always: a little brown cabinet with a metal roof, tilted slightly from frost heave. The glass behind the bulletin board was spider-cracked in one corner. Inside, the campground map had faded until the green for “trees” and the blue for “creek” were almost the same color. Someone had popped off one of the plastic holders and stuck a faded brochure for a zipline park over the “You are here” dot.

The parking apron was empty. No cars, no motorcycles, no bikes abandoned in a heap. Just old tire marks in the dust and a mound of gravel we’d dumped there a year ago and never spread.

I stopped, sat for a second with the engine idling. The only light was my headlights and the faint reflection off the kiosk glass.

On the inside of the kiosk door someone had taped one of our “Campground Full” tags from back when that mattered. It still had the little tear-off stubs for reserving sites. Every stub along the bottom edge had been neatly torn off.

I don’t know why that detail snagged me so hard. I made a mental note then. I didn’t know yet why it would matter.

“County, no vehicles at the kiosk,” I said. “I’m going to drive the upper loop once. If I see anything that looks like a party, I’ll call for a unit.”

“Copy, One. You are not to enter any structures alone, you hear me? No collapsing bathhouses, no scouting amphitheaters. We’ve been over this.”

“You spoil all my fun,” I said, out of habit more than anything.

I eased the truck forward.

The upper loop lives in that uncanny place between “completely abandoned” and “someone just left.”

The pavement is cracked but not gone. The site posts lean a little, but the numbers are still legible. Old reservation tags ride the clips, some bleached to tan rectangles, others with names you can still read: KHALIL, PETERSON, LIU. The picnic tables are gray and splintery. The fire rings are filled with leaves and pinecones and the occasional glass bottle some kid lobbed in.

I kept the truck in first and rolled slow, windows down.

My headlights washed over Site 3: empty pad, table, fire ring, post.

Site 4: same.

Site 5: same, except the ring of rocks around the fire pit looked… fresh. Uneven ring of rounded stones, some still damp like someone had recently hosed them or pulled them from the creek. No ash in the center. No scorch marks. Just an empty circle, too deliberate.

The way the stones leaned inward bothered me. Like they were all tilting a fraction toward the imaginary center.

I told myself it was kids. Teenagers love moving rocks more than they love anything except leaving trash.

Site 7 had another rock ring. Site 10 had two.

“Somebody’s been playing,” I muttered.

At Site 14 I hit the brakes.

The pull-in, on the outside of the loop overlooking the drop toward the creek, was occupied.

Not by a car. By a campsite.

Chairs—four of them—sat in a semicircle around the ring. Folding camp chairs, the cheap kind you buy at Walmart or Family Dollar, all different colors. An old Coleman two-burner stove rested on the picnic table. A blue cooler sat open on the ground, lid propped back. A lantern on the table flickered on low, lighting the whole scene in a pale, dirty yellow.

Nobody was there.

I killed the engine by reflex and the world dropped into quiet. The little hiss from the lantern suddenly felt loud.

The chairs faced the fire ring but were too close, their feet almost in the circle. One chair had a child-sized fleece hoodie draped over the back, sleeves hanging like arms. Another had a baseball cap parked on the seat. The cooler was full of melted ice water and floating cans. When I stepped closer and shone my flashlight, I could see that the labels were still sharp. The expiration dates on the juice boxes inside were current.

This wasn’t leftover from ten years ago.

“Anyone here?” I called. “Park service!”

My voice fell flat. No answering “yeah?” No rustle of someone climbing out of a tent. The right way to do it would’ve been to stand still and listen for a full minute. I managed maybe ten seconds.

The lantern on the table was an old battery model, plastic base, frosted tube, little dial on the side. The beam from my handheld caught the brand name: RAYOVAC ROUGHNECK. It flickered again, not with the smooth fade of a dying battery but with odd stutters, bright-dim-bright, like someone was blocking and unblocking the LED inside.

That’s when the smell drifted up.

Not rot. Not smoke. Pine cleaner. The same sharp, fake “fresh” the bathhouse used to have when it was still open and the maintenance crew dumped a gallon of concentrate in the mop bucket.

It was faint, but wrong out here. Too indoor.

I gave the site another sweep with my light. No tents. No hammocks. No footprints I could see without getting down on hands and knees. Just the set dressing.

“County, Ranger One,” I said quietly. “I’ve got an active-looking camp setup in closed Birch Run. Chairs, stove, food, but no people present. One battery lantern lit. No vehicle on the loop. Please advise if you’ve got any missing persons reports from the last few hours.”

“Stand by,” County said. I heard keyboard clacks. “Nothing reported in the last six from your area. We had a domestic in town and a shoplifter at the Walmart. That’s it.”

“Copy,” I said. “Any chance trooper could swing by the Birch Run road and sit on the gate?”

“He’s still on the rollover,” she said. “You want me to wake Miller for SAR?”

“Not yet,” I said. “I’m going to finish the loop, check the bathhouse. If I don’t find anyone, then we start making phone calls.”

“Copy. Time check is 01:12. Check in at quarter.”

The farther I went, the more “almost a campsite”s I found.

Site 18 had two chairs and a tablecloth laid out, white with little strawberries printed on it. The cloth was wrong-side up, the tag showing. The edges were folded under instead of hanging. The chairs faced the wrong way, backs to the fire ring.

Site 21 had three sleeping bags laid side by side on the pad, zipped up with nobody in them. Pillows at the top, indentations in the foam like heads had pressed them recently—but when I ran my hand over one, the impression was cold and bounced back too fast, like memory foam recovering from being squeezed while I wasn’t looking.

At Site 24, every item was centered. Chair in the exact middle of the pad. Cooler in the exact middle of the table. Fire ring stones aligned like someone had taken a carpenter’s square to them.

It all felt like whoever had arranged it had a list that said:

CAMP = CHAIR, FIRE, FOOD, NIGHT

and was checking off boxes, but had never actually sat by a fire in their life.

The bathhouse loomed up out of the dark after Site 30, at the bend where the loop starts to drop toward the amphitheater. Single-story cinderblock rectangle, green metal roof, men’s on the left, women’s on the right, “SHOWERS” sign so faded it just looked like white ghosts of letters.

In my headlights, the doors looked shut. The security light over the center had burned out a long time ago. The tiny window fans were dead. It should have been a black, blank shape.

Instead, light leaked out under the men’s side door. Not bright, not flickering. Steady, like a fluorescent or a cell phone flashlight left face-down.

A minivan squatted in the pull-through next to it. Silver Honda Odyssey with an “I BRAKE FOR HIKERS” bumper sticker, plates from our state. The front windows were fogged. One of those little tree air fresheners hung from the mirror, perfectly still.

My stomach tightened.

I pulled up behind it, angled to point my headlights at the bathhouse door, and got out.

The van’s hood was still warm under my palm. Not hot, but not cold-soaked either. It hadn’t been sitting there for days.

Driver’s door: closed. Back doors: closed. No visible damage. When I cupped my hands around my flashlight and peered in, I saw the usual family disaster: snacks in the cupholders, a crumpled map of the state on the passenger seat, a stuffed animal face-down on the floor in the back.

In the middle row, a kid’s booster seat sat empty. The seat belt lay slack over it like someone had unbuckled in a hurry.

“County, I’ve got a silver Honda Odyssey at Birch Run bathhouse,” I said, giving her the plate. “Appears recently parked. Lights inside men’s side are on. I’m going to make entry.”

“Copy, One,” she said. Her voice was tighter now. “Trooper is twenty-five out if he leaves right this second. You do not go in if you hear a domestic; you back out and wait. You hear me?”

“If they’re screaming at each other, I can live with that,” I said. “If there’s a kid stuck in a stall, I’m not waiting twenty-five.”

I walked up to the bathhouse door.

The light under it pulsed once and steadied. When I touched the handle, it was smooth with Pine-Sol residue, the kind that never fully washes off.

The door opened on the second push. The hinges complained. The smell hit me like a shove.

Pine cleaner, stale piss, old damp concrete. The usual. Under it, something else: a faint metallic tang and a whiff of something like singed plastic.

The light came from three ceiling fixtures in a row, flickering slightly. Tubes coated in dust, buzzing. Those should not have been on. Power to the campground had been cut at the main panel when they closed it.

“Hello?” I called. “Park service. Is anybody in here?”

My voice bounced off tile and cinderblock. No answer.

The men’s side had the usual layout: sinks on one wall, urinals and stalls on the other, showers in the back. Graffiti from before the closure was still visible: “LOGAN ’09,” a crude peace sign, “S+J” in a heart. Someone had tagged “FREE CANDY” on the paper towel dispenser and drawn an arrow to the tampon bin. People are imaginative in the most boring ways.

The stall doors were all open.

The first sink dripped. It had been dripping since the last time I’d done a walk-through in March, and probably for ten years before that. Our plumber keeps telling us he needs a new gasket; our budget keeps telling him to get in line.

On the counter by the third sink, someone had lined up three toothbrushes in a row. Red, blue, purple. Their heads all pointed the same direction, equidistant. No toothpaste in sight.

On the floor next to the diaper changing station, there were shoes.

Four pairs, all neatly against the wall, toes pointing out. Two adult sneakers, women’s size, a little dirt on the sides. One pair of men’s hiking shoes, still knotted. One pair of pink light-up kids’ sneakers with tiny rainbows on the sides.

No socks in them. No feet.

I don’t know how long I stood there looking at that row. My brain tried to make it into “family got ready for bed, left shoes there, went to wash up.” But you don’t leave shoes in the men’s side like that. You don’t line them up like a display.

Something ticked in the far corner, metal on tile, soft and quick. Not pipe noise. Something small making contact with something hard.

“County,” I said, keeping my voice low. “I’ve got a family van, an active-looking campsite, and four empty pairs of shoes lined up in the men’s bathhouse. No people present. It smells like someone mopped in here about an hour ago.”

“You’re not funny, One,” she said. “Trooper is en route, SAR pager is warming up. You get out of that building and wait.”

I took a step toward the shower area instead.

Rationally, I know that was stupid. Or at least unnecessary. But once you’ve seen empty kids’ shoes in a line, you don’t walk away without checking behind the next wall.

The showers were in their own alcove: four stalls with mildewed curtains, two on each side, drains in the middle. The floor sloped, slick with a decade of grime.

The first curtain on the left was closed.

The others were half-open, bunched.

If this were a movie, this is the part where the audience would be yelling at the screen. Real life doesn’t come with background music. It just comes with the sound of your own blood in your ears and the occasional drip hitting tile.

I reached for the closed curtain and pulled it aside.

Empty.

No body in the stall. No pile of clothes. No blood.

Just a plastic laundry basket in the corner with a few damp towels neatly rolled, like a hotel. The towel on top still had the fold crease.

I let the curtain fall. It moved sluggishly, plastic sticking to itself.

Something brushed my shoulder.

I jerked, spun, nearly slipped.

Nothing was there.

The air, though, had moved. A slow shift, like someone had walked past quickly.

The dripping at the sink had stopped.

All three fluorescent fixtures flickered at once, a quick stutter, then steadied. The buzz rose a pitch, then settled.

“Okay,” I said aloud. “Okay. Enough.”

I backed out, step by step, never turning my back fully on the room until I hit the outer door with my shoulder and pushed through into the night. The cool air hit my face like a slap.

The minivan sat where I’d left it. My truck’s hazard lights winked, forgotten. The arranged campsites stood in their careful little patterns.

Every hair on my arms was standing up.

“County, One,” I said. “Men’s bathhouse is empty of people. I’ve got fresh personal items and some weird staging: shoes, toothbrushes, towels. I’m going to do a quick check of the amphitheater hill and then get the hell out of here until backup arrives.”

“Language noted,” she said. “Miller’s awake. You’re on a short leash, Ortega.”

“Understood,” I said.

The amphitheater sits below the bathhouse, down a short footpath lined with timbers that are now mostly rot and moss. Four curved rows of log benches face a concrete pad and a metal fire circle. Behind it is a little wooden stage with a roof and a place to hang a projection screen.

When they closed the campground, they stacked benches from the lower loop there. Last time I’d seen it, it was a messy pile under dust and leaves.

Tonight, the path down was clear.

Every log bench was back in its original place. Four rows, evenly spaced, facing the stage. Someone had scraped moss off the tops and flipped the ones that were too rotten. The concrete pad had been swept. No branches, no leaves, no dirt.

The fire circle in front of the stage was full of stones, arranged in a tidy ring.

My flashlight cut across the benches, then landed on the stage.

There was someone standing there.

For half a second, that was the only way my brain could phrase it: someone. Upright shape in the light.

Then the details came into focus.

It was built out of campground debris.

A stack of camp chairs formed the torso, nested together, their legs splayed for balance. Two coolers stood where hips should be. Four folding tables leaned together to make the rough outline of legs. A bundle of rolled sleeping bags was lashed across the top for shoulders. On that sat a cluster of lanterns—five of them, old Coleman fuel lamps and new battery ones, arranged in a rough circle with their glass globes facing out.

All of them were on.

Not bright. A low, gut-level glow from each, so the cluster of them made a single dull corona. Light fell across the benches in a fan.

From where I stood, it looked like a person giving a talk. A ranger in a pile of borrowed gear.

No one had tied this together with rope. There weren’t any obvious straps holding it. The pieces seemed to lean and balance on each other in a way that shouldn’t have held as still as it did.

As I watched, one of the lanterns in the “head” bundle pulsed. The light inside flared, dimmed, flared, not in sync with the others. The surrounding glass caught and magnified it.

A sound drifted out.

Not a voice at first. A murmur. The faint rustle you get when a campground is half full and people are talking at their own fires, layered on each other. Laughter in the mix, kids arguing about s’mores, someone playing music too low to identify.

It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. Then my ear picked out the source: a cheap Bluetooth speaker wedged on the stage floor by the table-legs, its blue light blinking. It crackled and repeated a four-second loop.

“…no, you had the last one—hey, quit it—no, you had the last one—hey, quit it—”

The same snippet, over and over. Young boy’s voice, maybe nine or ten. The laughter on the loop didn’t quite match the words.

I took a step back up the path. Gravel shifted under my heel.

The whole figure on the stage tilted a fraction in my direction.

Not much. Just enough for the lanterns to throw new angles of light.

I hadn’t seen what was behind it before.

Against the back wall of the stage, in the shadow line, there were outlines. Three. Human-sized. Slumped.

As my light swept, it picked out fabric: a grown man’s jacket, a soft blue women’s hoodie, a child’s red raincoat. They were arranged upright, empty, sleeves dangling. The hoods were pulled up. The fronts were zipped.

Under each set of clothes, at floor level, sat a pair of shoes that matched the line I’d seen in the bathhouse: the adult sneakers, the hiking shoes, the little rainbow light-ups.

Their toes pointed toward the stacked gear figure.

I didn’t go up to touch them. I’d like to say I was thinking about evidence preservation. Mostly I was thinking about my own hands never forgiving me.

The lanterns on the “head” flickered again. The light inside one, a green Coleman, wavered like heat. Around the glass, just at the edges, I saw movement.

Not reflection. Not dust.

Something pale, slick, and many-jointed slid along the inner curve of the globe. It looked like a centipede had been flattened and stretched, its segments pushing against the glass in tiny waves. Where it passed, the light brightened for a heartbeat, then dimmed, like it was pulling power.

The Bluetooth speaker glitched.

The loop hiccuped, then changed.

“…Ben, did you get the—”

My name cracked out of it in an adult woman’s voice, half overlaid by static. It wasn’t my full name, just the first syllable, but it hit hard enough to make my chest tight.

The lantern glow swelled. The gear structure shifted a little more, pieces creaking. One of the sleeping bags at the top slumped and then righted itself like something inside had flexed.

Whatever was in the lanterns moved faster.

The scent of pine cleaner and burnt plastic got stronger.

A spray of gravel shot down from behind me as if someone had kicked it, though I hadn’t moved. The hair at the back of my neck prickled.

There’s a moment on a call when you realize you’re no longer in control of the scene. That you’re not the one deciding what happens next. I’ve had it with drunk drivers, with angry parents, with a black bear that wasn’t impressed by bear spray.

This was different. Less “someone’s going to punch me” and more “something here doesn’t care whether I exist.”

The stacked gear figure gave the tiniest lurch, like it had tried to take a step and hadn’t quite worked out how.

The second lantern from the left in the “head” cracked. Just a hairline. Light flared through it like it was pushing to get out.

I didn’t wait to see what happened if it did.

I turned and ran.

I wasn’t graceful about it. I slipped twice on the gravel path, whacked my shin on a timber, caught myself on a birch trunk at the top. My radio banged against my chest.

“County, One, I’m leaving the amphitheater,” I said between breaths. “There’s… I don’t know how to phrase this without sounding insane. There’s a large structure made of camping gear on the stage, with active lanterns and some kind of… insect or fungal growth in the globes. I’ve got empty clothes arranged like people against the back wall. No bodies. I’m backing out now.”

Silence on the other end for a beat.

Then: “Copy, One,” County said, in a voice that said she was writing every word down even while her brain was rejecting it. “Trooper is fifteen out. Miller wants you at your truck. Repeat: at your truck. Right now.”

“Already on my way,” I said.

As I skirted the bathhouse, every fluorescent tube inside blinked off at once. The seam under the door went from white to black. The humming stopped dead.

The van’s hazard lights flashed once, even though I hadn’t touched them. All four at the same time.

I threw myself into my truck, turned the key, and swung the headlights toward the entry road.

For a second, as the beams passed over the loop, I saw every site that had been arranged—the chairs, the coolers, the sleeping bags, the rings of stones. Each one caught the light at a slightly different angle. The metal parts glinted.

A breeze came down the hill, gentle, carrying the faint sound of something soft shifting. Canvas. Nylon. Tarps rubbing against each other.

I did not look back as I drove out.

At the gate, the chain I’d left hanging loose was threaded back through the posts, the padlock sitting open in its usual place. The camera’s red LED blinked twice, then died.

I pulled through, got out, and snapped the lock shut myself.

My hands were shaking hard enough that it took three tries.

Officially, the search started at first light.

Unofficially, I was back at Birch Run with Miller and two deputies before sunrise, watching our breath in the cold and telling myself daylight would make everything look stupid.

We swept the campground: upper loop, lower loop, bathhouse, amphitheater, creek crossings. SAR volunteers in orange vests pushed through willows along the water. A K9 unit sniffed the trails. The helicopter from the next county over did a couple of lazy circles at mid-morning, servo whine drifting down.

We found the van, same as I had. We found the campsite at Site 14, chairs, cooler, stove, lantern—now dead. We found the neat shoes in the men’s bathhouse, the toothbrushes in a row, the basket of towels.

The amphitheater was not the same.

The benches were piled again, all heaped at one side like someone had broken down an event in a hurry. The stage was bare. No stacked gear figure, no lantern bundles, no speaker, no clothes arranged against the back wall.

We did find a few things that shouldn’t have been there.

A patch of the concrete at the edge of the stage was scorched in a perfect circle about two feet across, as if someone had set a metal barrel there and burned something hot. The blackened area smelled faintly of melted plastic.

In the crack between the stage and the back wall, Miller reached down with gloved fingers and fished out a sliver of glass. It was curved and cloudy, with a thin smear of something pale along the inside.

“From a lantern globe?” one of the deputies asked.

“Maybe,” Miller said. He held it up to the light. The pale smear had a texture. Not powder. Not dried fuel. More like the membrane inside an egg.

He dropped it into an evidence bag and sealed it.

We logged everything. We did the door-to-door with the plate number. We got a call from a worried sister in Tucson who said her brother, his wife, and their eight-year-old had left on a camping trip and hadn’t checked in. Their names matched the registration on the van. We kept looking.

We never found them.

The official narrative settled into place with depressing ease. “Family entered closed campground, possibly via social media tip. Camped in unsafe area. Evidence suggests they may have gone down to the creek after dark. High water from upstream release could have swept them downstream toward the reservoir.”

People like water stories. They’re neat. No monsters, no questions about what else we don’t control. Just current and bad luck.

There’s a line in the final report about “unusual staging of campsites and personal effects, likely the work of unrelated trespassers over years of closure.” It made someone at Region headquarters feel better to put it there. It makes me feel worse every time I see it.

A week after we stopped active searching—the first week of October—I went back once, in the middle of the day, because apparently I don’t learn.

I told myself I was checking the locks and batteries. Making sure the signs were still up. Seeing if someone had broken into the van now that it had become part of the scenery.

It was a bright, thin noon. Aspen leaves had just begun to go from green to gold at the edges. The sky was that high, blank blue that promises colder nights soon. Highway 17 sounded different in the daylight; tire noise has a separate pitch when you’re not listening for anything else.

At the kiosk, someone had flipped the old “Campground Full” tag around so the blank side faced out. All the little reservation stubs along the bottom were torn off again except one.

That one had a name written on it in block letters: ORTEGA.

I stared at it for a while, counted to fifty, then carefully pulled it off and folded it into my pocket. It wasn’t my handwriting. The ink was fresh enough that it smudged on my thumb.

On the upper loop, the sites were messier than before. Rocks scattered, chairs knocked over. Like someone had taken a hand across a toy box.

At Site 14, the cooler was gone. The chairs were still there, collapsed.

The bathhouse was truly dead this time. No power, no smell of cleaner. The row of shoes was missing one of the adult pairs; there was a damp mark on the floor where they’d been, shaped like the soles had been wet when someone stood in them.

I did not go down to the amphitheater.

I stood at the top of the path and listened. Wind in the leaves. A jay complaining. A distant truck on the highway.

Under it, for a second, I heard the faint, tinny burst of a child’s laugh, cut off mid-giggle. Not from the stage. From somewhere between the sites, like someone had turned a speaker on and off.

I walked back to my truck without looking toward where I thought it came from.

We never did get footage from the gate camera that made sense.

The system out there is old. It records motion in twenty-second bursts, overwrites itself every seventy-two hours. That night, at 00:39, the logs say it triggered and saved.

The file plays as fifteen seconds of empty road, headlights just leaving frame, the edge of my truck as I drove in.

For the last five seconds, the chain across the gate moves.

It lifts, droops, lifts again. Not like someone took it off. More like someone underneath it was trying to wriggle out without being noticed. There’s no hand, no body, no shadow. Just the metal rising and falling in smooth arcs, then settling.

I’ve shown it to two different IT guys and one state wildlife biologist. The IT guys shrugged and blamed compression glitches. The biologist watched it twice, frowned, and suggested wind gusts.

There are no leaves moving in the background when the chain lifts.

Nobody’s written anything about that part down. Files are already thick. Budgets are already thin. The last thing anyone wants is a line in a report that says “chain moved on its own.”

So Birch Run stays on the spreadsheet as “Closed — Unsafe Infrastructure.” We tell people the ground there is unstable. That the creek could cut the bank out from under them. That the bathhouse is condemned. All of that is technically true.

We don’t mention the amphitheater. Or the shoes in the men’s side. Or the way campsite setups appear and disappear between patrols.

Every once in a while, a motion alarm still goes off on the gate, usually on still nights. We send the newest ranger out to “take a look,” in daylight, with a partner. They come back with stories about beer cans, graffiti, the usual.

Last month, one of them mentioned seeing a fresh ring of stones around the fire circle at Site 18, no ash, no soot. He said it looked like someone did it just to do it.

“Probably kids,” he said. “Bored kids.”

I nodded and wrote it down like it was nothing.

When I’m honest, I think there’s something in that bowl of trees that hates an empty campground.

I think it learned some version of “camp” from decades of families showing up with their coolers and chairs and plastic lanterns, playing their little songs into the night. I think when the state shut it down, whatever was watching didn’t understand why the pattern stopped.

Now, whenever somebody sneaks in, it studies them. It takes their layout. It copies what it can. It keeps trying to build a full house out of whatever people leave lying around: chairs, shoes, towels, recordings.

Maybe it miscounts sometimes. Maybe it keeps more than it should.

These days, when I’m on lakeside patrol and catch the Birch Run turnoff sign in my side mirror, I keep my eyes on the highway. If the radio crackles and County says “motion at Birch Run” and “911 ping near the old payphone,” I have a sudden urgent need to check the far west boundary fence, or count buoys, or anything that keeps me busy somewhere with other people in shouting distance.

The new rangers roll their eyes. They think I’ve gone soft. “It’s just an abandoned campground,” one of them said last week. “What’s it going to do, bore you to death?”

Miller doesn’t say much. He just glances at me when Birch Run comes up on the call sheet, then quietly assigns someone else.

On the nights I can’t sleep and end up driving, I sometimes pull off at mile marker 142 and sit where the highway curves. From there you can see a suggestion of the Birch Run bowl, a dark patch of trees against slightly darker hills.

If I roll the window down, I can hear the wind and the occasional hiss of a semi on the grade.

Once—just once—I thought I heard something else under it. The sharp little thunk of a cooler lid closing. The click of a lantern dial.

When I got back to the station that night, the coffee pot had boiled itself dry. The ring in the bottom took twenty minutes of scrubbing to get out.

I try not to think about the timing.

I didn’t say my name out loud in the truck on the way home.

1oxfz4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/cf4cf/comments/1oxfz4q/34f4a_southeast_asia_looking_for_emotionally/,34F4A | Southeast Asia | Looking for emotionally intelligent partner open to LDR,"I’m a 34-year-old woman currently based in Malaysia. I have lived across multiple countries (Turkey, Korea, Japan, Malaysia), and my job gives me geographic flexibility, so I’m genuinely open to relocating for the right person. It would be wonderful if you’re also based in Asia so we could be geographically closer, but I understand that’s not always how life works. Important: I don’t do magical thinking or use LDR as an excuse to be emotionally avoidant. I’m genuinely looking for a real, committed partnership, and the distance is a practical reality, not a psychological shield.

**Who am I?:**

I’m someone who contains multitudes. I can discuss Chris Marker and memory one moment, then crack jokes about the latest South Park episode the next. I have a deep, contemplative side that loves art, literature, philosophy, and meaningful conversation, but I’m also genuinely funny and don’t take myself too seriously. I can laugh at my own absurdities and find humor in life’s contradictions. I value authenticity over performance, and I’d rather have one real conversation than a dozen superficial ones.

I’m grounded and present in my daily life. I find joy in simple things like watching birds on my rooftop, good coffee at my favorite café, dancing alone in my apartment, or meaningful conversations with colleagues. I’m independent and self-sufficient; I don’t need someone to complete me or fix my life. I’m looking for a partner to share experiences with, not someone to rescue me or be rescued by me. I’m resilient, empathetic, and kind. I show up for people I care about and I expect the same in return. I believe in fighting for what matters and letting go of what doesn’t serve me.

I’m community-oriented wherever I live. I enjoy being an engaged member of my surroundings and doing good in the world. You don’t need to be as social as I am, but you should appreciate this quality in me.

I’ve done extensive therapy and personal growth work to overcome a difficult background (C-PTSD), and I’m incredibly attracted to people who’ve done the same. If you’ve worked through your own challenges with persistence, therapy, and self-reflection, that’s deeply appealing to me.

**What I’m looking for:**

I’m looking for someone emotionally mature and intelligent who understands what a long-distance relationship actually entails: it requires EXTRA communication and consistency, not less.

**My non-negotiables:**

- **Childfree** (absolutely no room for interpretation here)

- **Emotionally intelligent and self-aware:** ideally someone who has done therapy/personal growth work

- **Consistent and reliable:** someone who follows through on what they say

- **Strong communicator:** can acknowledge vulnerability, discuss feelings, handle conflict maturely without defensiveness or passive-aggression

- **Established and stable:** financially responsible, has their own life, interests, and/or friend groups

- **No substance abuse issues:** occasional social drinking is fine, but no dependency

- **Gaming/internet use is recreational, not escapism:** I’m grounded in real life and need a partner who is too

- **Wants genuine partnership:** someone who wants to grow beside me, not someone looking for a parent/therapist/project

What partnership means to me: Two whole people who choose each other and actively work to maintain connection. We have our own hobbies, friends, and interests, but we prioritize each other and our relationship. We communicate openly, handle conflicts maturely, and show up consistently even when it’s hard.

**My approach to this:**

I don’t use dating apps. I don’t believe in swiping through people like commodities. I prefer slow-burn connection built on genuine compatibility and shared values.

I don’t want to share my photos publicly, but I’m happy to exchange them once we move to private conversation. I like to move to voice messages or video calls relatively early (not immediately, but once we’ve established basic compatibility through text) to see if there’s natural chemistry and get a feel for each other’s energy.

I appreciate people holistically (intellectually, emotionally, physically), and I want someone who sees and values all aspects of who I am, not just one dimension.

**Important notes:**

- I’m serious about my boundaries and standards. I’ve learned what I don’t want from experience, and I’m not willing to compromise on my core needs.

- One-sentence responses will not get replies. If you’re interested, put in the effort to write something thoughtful that shows you actually read this post that took some time for me to draft. 

- Geographic flexibility: I can relocate due to my career. If you’re also flexible or willing to consider it, that’s a huge plus.

P.S. Even if you’re not personally interested but know someone who might be a great match for me, feel free to play traditional matchmaker! If you introduce me to someone and we end up being compatible, I’d love to send you a thank-you gift for bringing us together. :) ",2,1763173608.0,cf4cf,1,1.0,False

I've seen a few people in longer term recovery (2 years, 3 years, more) saying ""oops, I forgot to post on nth anniversay, so here I am now) and I think that's worth having a think about.

I spend quite a lot of time here on r/stopdrinking, typing pretty similar messages to people - ""one day at a time""

""Don't set a target more than one day ahead, because that's really far away and difficult to achieve""

""Just today. It's just a day. Don't try to find the strength for a month, or 6 months, or a week. You just need strength for today. Tomorrow, you'll find some more.""

That sort of thing. Not because they're easy lines to remember but because they're *true*. They seem obvious to those of who have been through it, but we also know that they're a long, long way from obvious to people setting foot on this journey for the first time.

The second time.

The third time.

However many times, no matter how far along, it's important.

But...

What I've found, and I'm noticing other people saying they've found, is that milestones I'd envisioned as being really important are becoming less and less important the longer I am on this journey.

For instance:

Here's my ""diary"". A diary of diminishing importance, 2025.:

* before day zero - go a day without drinking? Don't be so bloody stupid. Why would I want to do that? I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm fine. Stop bothering me.
* day zero - [oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1om4y5t/10_months_ago_today_a_tale_of_madness/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (tldr; massive liver failure, with hepatic encephalopathy. Nearly died in hospital)
* day 1 - 2 days without drinking? Oh, no. That's going to be really tough. Fuck! What else can I binge watch, that doesn't involve other people drinking???
* day 3  - a whole week? Sweet Jesus, that's ages.
* week 1 - My God, that was difficult. Can I have a drink to celebrate? No, no! Stupid! You'll die. Day 10 is coming up - just chew through the days until you get there. You can do this... get through today, TDD, just today. Come on...
* some wibbly timey wimey stuff (\~\~\~\~\~ day 11, day 12, day 13, day... \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~)
* month 3 - How many days? Erm... not sure, I need to ask chatGPT. How did I manage to lose count?
* month 6 - 6 months? Wow, that's (counts on fingers) 26 weeks, right?
* month 8 - I need to meet up with Big Lil Sis\* to collect my token. I must set a reminder in the diary
* month 10 (and a bit)  - Crap, we skipped right over 9 and 10, do we have time to meet up for 11? That's going to be right on top of panto\*\* - why don't we just do the congratulatory thing at rehearsals? What do you mean you've lost the tokens??? you... urgh.
* month 12 (upcoming) - yeah, ok that's kinda important. We'll definitely meet up for that one.

I think there was a moment when I got to six months where it was... not so much ""I've stopped thinking about drinking"", but more like ""I've stopped thinking about not drinking"" - it's not that my sobriety is not an important thing, it's more that it's not *the most important thing about me*. The most important thing(s) about me have become new things. Real things .

*Important things*

Things that actually matter, where my sobriety is taken for granted by myself and others. It's not even discussed, it just *is*. It has no relevance, it has no weight and yet, somehow, it's everything.

Weird, huh? I'm not explaining it well but, one day, you'll notice that you haven't even thought about *not drinking* for a few days. That's the day I think you'll know, like I know, you've replaced the bad habit with good ones.

That day is a good day.

Not because it mattered - but because it didn't matter at all.

IWNDWYT

\* Big Lil Sis - her and I have... had... a nice little thing where we'd meet on the 2nd of each month for coffee and cake. I bought myself a set of sobriety chips, and gave her to them to keep for me. The ideas is that she'd present me with a token, discreetly of course, marking each month of my journey. We're both just a little disorganised and I think it's actually happened on time twice. One or both of us was late.

\*\* panto - for those of you in the USA, google this. It's a big, very silly, theatre production. A massive British Christmas insitution. I'm taking part this year, on stage singing and dancing as a minor recurring bad guy character. I didn't do it last year, mostly because it very much would have got in the way of my drinking.

Believe it or not, it's actually quite serious. Comedy is hard work! The madness and chaos you see on stage is choreographed down to the finest detail. You get two hours of entertainment in return for hundreds of hours of collective work by a backstage army, not just those onstage. Do go, if you can - support your local dram group, if you have one.

Final Takeaways: 
1. Try to search up your interviewer before hand and PREPARE QUESTIONS, I don't think my interviewer cared the most about me but I made a good impression since I asked questions that were coordinated to his experience 
2. The interviewer knows nothing about you other than your name, so keep a list of things you want to cover and try to make the most of it in part that you talk 
3. Don't take yourself too seriously?? It's a good thing to be human and try to relax, its just a coffee chat

If you are not yet applying, one way to prepare yourself for these interviews are to schedule coffee chats, go on linkedin and ask people to talk to you about internships or profile reviews, ask other people how they got in, start early to build up the confidence, I mean I did it all through hs and it helped",7,1763173117.0,ApplyingToCollege,2,1.0,False

Still, there was a gravity in you, a quiet pull I recognized— the kind of presence that leaves a trace behind long after the moment goes.

⸻

We laughed about nothing, that easy, drifting nothing that only exists between people who owe each other nothing at all.

You offered the first small truths— not heavy, but vulnerable— the kind that open a door without announcing an invitation.

So I let a few of mine slip out, pieces I keep tucked where few look. I waited for the sting. It never came. It simply didn’t matter to you.

⸻

It wasn’t the night— it was the looseness of it, the slack in me I hadn’t felt in years.

You weren’t gentle; you were perceptive in a way that felt almost sharp— a gaze that cut clean lines through whatever I pretended to be.

Not unkind— just unnervingly accurate.

⸻

Maybe that’s why the next moment slipped past my guard.

We were reading aloud, words moving between us light as breath, when your hand found my leg— steady, certain, as if the gesture had been waiting for its place in the evening.

And not until later did your fingers reach my face, brushing hair behind my ear, touching me like someone memorizing something they knew wouldn’t last.

You noticed everything. I noticed you noticing.

⸻

We made a choice that left its weight on me, and I’m still carrying it.

Later, alone, I cried in a way that startled me— not dramatic, just a sudden shattering of something I once thought solid.

⸻

Days passed. I stepped into the cold and let the air straighten my spine.

I ran and felt my voice return. I danced down a sidewalk with coffee warming my hands like a promise I’d forgotten I could give myself.

⸻

And in this unraveling— this slow, honest peeling-back— I’m meeting the part of myself I tucked away for safekeeping.

The part that wants to feel fully, to shape the ache into something, to grow toward the person I keep meaning to become.

It hurts— but the hurt feels like direction.

⸻

Waking up is strange like that: the clarity, the tremor of what comes next, uneasy about the work ahead, yet grateful for the chance to rise into it.

I don’t know you, not really. But for a moment— a brief crossing in borrowed time— we met between strangers, and something in me moved that needed to.",12,1763173070.0,UnsentLetters,3,0.88,False

We’re hosting a Fall Movie & Game Night + Friendsgiving on Friday, November 21st at Marine Park Coffee (3411 Avenue S). Doors open at 5:00 PM — come early to hang out, play board games, and meet people before the movie starts around 6:30 PM.

We’ll be showing My Cousin Vinny, the classic Joe Pesci/Marisa Tomei comedy that’s basically required Brooklyn viewing. Marine Park Coffee will be set up like a cozy mini theater with popcorn, water, and a relaxed community vibe.

Since it’s Friendsgiving, feel free to bring a dish, dessert, or snack to share. We’ll eat together before and during the movie — a great way to try some new food and meet new folks.

The event is open to young adults ages 18–35 with a $5 cover that includes popcorn and water. Soft drinks will be available for $1 thanks to Marine Park Coffee.

Whether you’re from Marine Park, Mill Basin, Bay Ridge, Midwood, or anywhere nearby, you’re totally welcome — the goal is simply to create a fun space for young adults to meet, connect, and enjoy the night.

Please give me ideas.

So far I have offered to talk at any time even if it is for coffee. I have given her a book and blanket.

It is a very scary time as she just has found out the results of the PET scan and has not announced it yet. I have offered to drive her to appointments.

Is there any other support you or your loved one appreciated?

Her cover of Barracuda demonstrates an appreciation for music of the past. I admit , I envision her doing covers of The Ozark Mountain Daredevils Jackie Blue and Blue Oyster Cults City of Flame's ;  but realize her own music and creativity is more important than one devoted fans envisioning. Her representation of the  same Midwest I come from is one she represents so well. 
 There's a traditional quality about her , yet a modern and cultural revolution amidst her musical message. It offers a musical bridge that accommodates all who cross it.  She's also demonstrating an appreciation for our good neighbors to the North in Canada. The photo of her as a member of The Royal Canadian Mounted Police  demonstrates brilliant marketing , diplomacy and goes beyond adorable. Such an image is timely and comforting ,  given our current unwarranted conflict with Canada.  Saturday Night Live would really be dropping the ball if they did not have her as a musical guest once again , performing her song Subway. Lorne Michaels ! You've been in this business a long time !
