He is pretty shy, although he speaks a lot around his friends. I had some thoughts that he might like me (he looks at me and then turns away very fast when I catch him, looks at the floor, and stops talking when I pass nearby). I was never quite sure if these were signs that he likes me, but it struck me a few days ago. Even though we study in the same group at uni (we have seminars together all the time), we've never exchanged words. However, we had some exams last week, and I ended up starting a conversation with him. He wasn't very talkative, so I ended up speaking a lot, oops :))) It was also just small talk because we didn't have much time. So, I want to talk to him more, but his friends/my friends are always around, and it's not possible. However, I was thinking about texting him that I kind of enjoyed it last time and would like to continue talking, so maybe we could meet up and do something together. I just want to know if this is creepy or not, 'cause we've never texted before and he never gave me his number - I have it because we're in the same WhatsApp group for uni.

  
Key point I forgot to mention:))) I also like him.

  
So I was thinking about writing something like: Hey, you've been on my mind since our last talk. How about we pick up where we left off last time and do something together, like go for a coffee or a walk? Would be great to see you. 

  
I don't know if I should be more straightforward because he's shy, but I don't want to make us feel uncomfortable since we see each other every day.  ",1,1765390576.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

My girlfriend wants an espresso machine with a built-in milk steamer. I know this is frowned upon in this subreddit but she is not going to grind her own beans, she's already stated as much.

I know the Bambino is usually the best entry-level option, but I'm wondering if this is still the case if you're going to be using pre-ground coffee or if something like the Dedica EC680 might actually be more appropriate since its pressurized settings are more consistent?

1pj9yv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1pj9yv7/am_i_right_in_wanting_to_go_nc_with_my_parents/,Am I right in wanting to go NC with my parents?,"After years of feeling miserable every time I see them, I'm finally considering going NC. 

Two years ago, they came to our house, and I was having a severe flareup with flu-like symptoms. I had to stay under a heated blanket on the sofa, barely able to open my eyes, let alone stand up and she scolded me for not making coffee for my father (who didn't even ask for one). I forced myself to go with them to a museum the next day and they didn't even wait for me when I needed to sit down and take a break. I spent two hours all alone waiting for them to finish all the floors and neither of them would pick up their phone to tell me where they were.

The last straw was last July when my partner and I went visiting them for a week. For context, we live abroad so I visit them once or twice a year max (been abroad for ten years) and I have both autism and fibromyalgia (since childhood but it's become debilitating in the more recent years). €600 in flights between the two of us, and for what? They spent most of the time ignoring us, sulking, giving us the silence treatment whenever we didn't meet their expectations, except when we invited them to a restaurant. Suddenly, my mother was delighted and became a different person. Same when we bought something for them. But then went back to sulking.

They live in France and 14 July is National Day. So on that day, they forced me to go see the fireworks from the top of a hill. At this point I didn't dare disagreeing and being too vocal about it since it had been two days they weren't talking to us already. So still with my fibro flareup, I had to climb this hill and they didn't even bother waiting for me. Then we had to wait sitting on the ground for an hour and 45 minutes because they wanted to get there at 9:30 PM for the fireworks that started at 11:15 PM.

As I said, I'm autistic and I don't do well with noise and crowds. So with everyone around, I had a complete meltdown too. They saw it and pretended not to see anything. They didn't say a single word the entire time we were on that hill. My boyfriend is the only one who took care of me and calmed me down. After, we had to walk for 30 minutes to get back to their place as the streets were blocked for the celebrations and no buses were running. At this point, I could barely walk and my boyfriend was acting as a human crutch for me. They still didn't wait for us and acted like they didn't give a damn.

A couple of days later, we went to Mont Saint-Michel and they again went off on their own. There is a shuttle that connects the Mont with the parking lot so you don't have to walk. My boyfriend and I obviously took the shuttle since I cannot walk for too long. They decided to walk...Then they made no effort to call us and try to meet us so we were on our own.

My partner and I were both appalled by their behaviour. They gave us the impression that it bothered them that we were at their place.

Besides that, I have to get over the fact that they ruined my childhood. I grew up being always scared because they were always beating my brother with a whip and I was terrified they were going to kill him. My mother was exploding with rage on a daily basis, always slamming things down on the table, slamming doors and cupboard doors, threatening to suicide whenever my brother and I wouldn't do what she expected. As a teenager, I had to grab all her pills to throw them outside because she was ready to swallow them all..

Over the years, I've become very bitter, especially now that I'm old enough (33) to have a family of my own. I realise this isn't what good parents do. Despite all that, whenever I bring something up, she'll gaslight me, saying things like, ""With everything we've done for you..."". About last summer in particular: ""it's not true we ignored you. I do everything I can to make you feel at ease at home"".

She also loves to guilt-trip me by mentioning all the times they helped me move and find apartments when I was a student. I'm grateful for them supporting me when I was a student, but I don't think it gives them the right to treat me poorly.

Mother's also become a narcissist lately. Every time she messages me and asks how I am and I reply (that I struggle with fibro), she makes everything about herself and tells me how hard she worked for us kids despite her own illness (she has ankylosing spondylitis).

I honestly can't take it anymore. As harsh as it sounds, I don't love them. I don't even like them. Visiting them has been giving me anxiety for at least ten years. Spending Christmas at their house used to make me feel depressed the entire January. 

At this point I just want to not hear from them anymore, but at the same time I feel guilt. I know she will manipulate me to keep me around, calling me and messaging me, threatening to kill herself. Do I block both of their numbers? And then what happens when they die? How will I know about it? I'm scared, please share your experiences, I just want peace in my life.

This post is gonna sound a bit like an email as I'm not very experienced in posting on Reddit so please bear with me. I have two essays due soon and it's becoming more and more apparent that I'm going to have to pull an all nighter to get them done.

I'm quite an anxious person in general so my caffeine intake is limited to matcha and tea (and those aren't even had daily). I've had coffee at times but it was usually when I was in secondary school and continuously sleep deprived, it makes me pretty hyper and shaky.

I'm looking for something that would give me enough oomph to get me through the night, but not make me so hyper that my brain isn't functioning and render me useless.

HERE'S SOMETHING TO ASK YOURSELF,"Did you really like or love smoking or is that how nicotine addiction works (i.e., it feels like like or love but it is not)? Wasn't it really more a vicious, daily repeating cycle of nicotine addiction, i.e., an uncomfortable withdrawal from nicotine *and then replenishment to our bodies of a falling nicotine level causing a huge feeling of relief of that withdrawal*, *over and over again, day after day?* (That last sentence reminds me of brain washing or a trauma bond that happens in a toxic relationship.) And now that we have stepped away from using nicotine and are maybe weeks, months or even years into our quits, and we find ourselves reminiscing or romanticizing smoking, are we then only remembering the times we felt the relief of withdrawal and forgetting the pain of withdrawing that preceded feeling the relief? I know that is why those morning cigarettes were so precious to me. I had withdrawn for hours while sleeping and my body was experiencing the pain of withdrawal. And I relieved that withdrawal alright--by smoking several cigarettes with my morning coffee. To make matters worse, for those addicted to nicotine, science says it literally hijacks our brain's own ability to regulate its supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine, setting us up to really be addicted to nicotine and dependent on it. I can't find anything to like or love about either of these things. Actually it kind of makes me mad.

The above is just a couple of things I have learned about my addiction (see links and book below) and it makes a huge difference to me knowing these things. I don't love smoking, I am a nicotine addict and I didn't like withdrawal and I didn't like missing the dopamine punches nicotine gave me when I used it. There really is so much to learn about nicotine addiction, and educating yourself about nicotine addiction is going to be the weapon/tool/superpower (you name it) you can use to quit and stay quit.

Customers are usually friendly enough or at least neutral (with some glaring exceptions), my boss is super chill and jokes around with us, and pay isn't terrible. 

But there are still days I wonder why I do this to myself. 

It started l like a normal day for me in terms of opening: I got in at 5 for my shift (as you probably could tell from the title, I work in a bagel place), made sure coffee was made, got everything in order for line and getting meats and eggs ready. We unlock the door at 6 and the day goes on to be fairly standard for the next few hours. It was fine, if not oddly busy for a Wednesday.

Then the first bathroom experience of the day: it was minor and I didn't think much of it, I was on my 30 and went to the bathroom, the toilet was clogged so I grabbed the plunger and unclogged it.

2-2 1/2 hours later I'm on register, taking people's orders, totally frazzled because I'm also managing drinks, cream cheese tubs, chips, and bakery items for online orders. At this point I only had two receipts and they were ready to just be packaged up by my coworkers with the rest of the order. I'm not fully functioning, I'm tired and I just want to go home. 

I'm taking this man's order, he orders a sandwich and says ""also"", I assumed he was about to add to the order which makes sense. I cannot emphasize enough how casual this was, it sounded like he was just adding another item to his order, but no, it's a customer service job and things are never that easy. So after ordering his sausage, egg, and cheese on a plain bagel, he goes, ""also, the floor of the men's bathroom is covered in blood"". I stand there for a second before I process what he just said, my coworker was standing next to him restocking some things and didn't even look up because of how nonchalant he was about it. I literally just said ""oh, okay, that's.. huh"" and then proceeded to ask my coworker if she can cover register for me, she asks why and then says she'll do it (I think she just didn't want to be on register). Eventually my manager ended up doing it, either because it was a biohazard or because he was the only male on shift idk. 

The third bathroom related event is much more mild but infinitely more infuriating. It's maybe half an hour later and an older woman approaches me to tell me we're out of paper towels in the women's bathroom. I go in to check, already tired because I had a strong suspicion about the reality of the situation. The paper towel dispenser sometimes gets jammed and you have to fiddle with the thing where you tear the paper towel off. I thought doing that when the paper towel dispenser doesn't work in a bathroom was common practice before I began working this job. I was wrong, obviously. My main issue is that, if this woman looked at the side of the dispenser she would have seen a still rather full roll of paper towels. It's not a big deal but it's frustrating because it should be an easy, common sense fix for people.

I do.

I remember the first time
when you said we weren’t working,
your voice steady,
your hands folded.
I watched you walk away
and the world folded with you.

So I rewound.

We tried again.
I didn’t flinch at your sister’s name.
I laughed at the right joke.
I kissed you before the silence could rot.
But it still happened.

Version three.
Then four.
I stopped telling you I loved you
too early.
Then I tried too late.
Sometimes I just sat in the dark
and waited to forget.
But I never did.

You’ve only ever lived the best of us.
The polished take.
But I’ve lived the outtakes,
the screaming matches,
the doors that slammed hard enough
to shake time loose.

I watched you fall out of love
with such precision
I could draw it.
So I redrew it.

Sometimes I catch you looking at me
not confused, exactly,
just distant.
As if you sense the echoes.
As if some version of you
remembers what I keep erasing.

Once, I let it play out.
No resets.
No rewinds.
You cried, and I didn’t stop you.
And it hurt in a way
that stayed.
Even when I reset.

We’re on version fifteen now.
You’re humming in the kitchen,
barefoot and alive.

And I’m afraid to blink.
Because even now,
I’m not sure
whether I’m saving this
or
just
stalling the loss.",1,1765389909.0,poemsbyreddit,0,1.0,False
1pj9oez,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netsuite/comments/1pj9oez/norcal_netsuite_meetup_in_sf_whos_in/,NorCal NetSuite Meetup in SF: Who’s In?,"Thinking about organizing a super casual in-person holiday meetup in San Francisco for NetSuite folks based in Northern California: Bay Area, Sacramento, and nearby regions.

This idea came out of the NetSuite Reddit community and SuiteWorld meetups. No sponsors, no vendors, no presentations - just an informal hangout for NetSuite professionals, admins, consultants, partners, and internal team members. Think “grab a drink, talk shop, meet cool people.”

Pay your own tab kind of deal : beer, coffee, whatever. The goal is just to get together and connect with people who live in this ecosystem day to day.

If there’s enough interest, we’ll pick a spot in SF and target a date around the holidays, maybe that week between Christmas and New Year’s when work tends to slow down a bit.

Open to everyone - whether you’re a customer, a partner, or working at NetSuite/Oracle directly. If you’re local-ish and want to meet other folks in the space, we’d love to have you.

My Meta ads were getting impressions. Lots of them. But clicks? Crickets. The kind of silence that makes you question your entire existence and wonder if maybe, just maybe, everyone on the internet collectively decided your product looks like something they'd find at a gas station clearance bin.

Here's the thing nobody tells you: most ""copywriting frameworks"" are just expensive ways to say the same thing everyone else is saying. AIDA? PAS? Before-After-Bridge? Cool. So is everyone else's ad in the feed.

I spent $127K testing headlines. Not because I'm rich (I'm not), but because I was tired of ""experts"" telling me to ""create urgency"" or ""use power words"" without explaining WHY certain headlines made people stop mid-scroll while others got ignored faster than a LinkedIn request from someone with ""Entrepreneur | Hustler | Dream Chaser"" in their bio.

# The Test That Changed Everything

Here's what I did that nobody else seems to be doing: I didn't just test headlines. I tracked which psychological trigger was being activated, then cross-referenced it against time of day, audience awareness stage, product price point, how long the person had been scrolling, and whether they were serial clickers or casual scrollers.

After 2,847 headlines, 412 sleepless nights, and one very concerned wife asking if I was ""okay, like, mentally,"" I found 12 psychological triggers that consistently drove clicks. But here's the kicker: they work in specific combinations, not isolation.

# The 12 Triggers That Actually Matter

# Trigger #1: Pattern Disruption

Everyone talks about pattern interrupts. ""BE WEIRD! BE RANDOM!"" Wrong.

Pattern disruption means violating the expectation of what you're supposed to say. Like when I tested ""This Watch Will Change Your Life"" (0.4% CTR) against ""This Watch Costs $89 and You'll Probably Hate It"" (3.7% CTR).

The second headline activated curiosity through cognitive dissonance. Why would someone sell something they think you'll hate?

Critical insight: this trigger works 340% better on cold traffic between 8-10 PM when people's BS detectors are highest, but actually decreases performance on warm traffic who already trust you. I burned through $4,200 testing this at different times before I figured out the pattern.

# Trigger #2: Specificity Stacking (The ""3-Layer Rule"")

One layer of specificity increases CTR by 40%. Two layers increase it by 140%. Three layers increase it by 190%. Four layers? Back down to 60% because now you sound like you're trying too hard.

""Get More Sales"" got 0.3% CTR. ""Get 40% More Sales"" hit 0.9%. ""Get 40% More Sales in 23 Days Using This Checkout Trick"" reached 2.8%. Add a fourth layer and you're back to 1.2%.

Here's what cost me $8,400 to learn: the optimal specificity level changes based on price point. Under $50 products need two layers. $50-$200 products need three layers. Over $200 products should go back to two layers because over-specificity signals desperation on high-ticket items.

# Trigger #3: Owned Negative Positioning

My best-performing headline of all time: ""This Skincare Routine Takes 8 Minutes Every Morning (Most People Quit After Day 4)."" CTR: 4.2%. CPA was 68% lower than my positive-angle headlines.

You're pre-qualifying the click by admitting ""this isn't for everyone."" It activates exclusivity (people want to prove they're NOT ""most people"") and honesty signaling (if you're admitting a downside, you must be trustworthy).

The key: you have to own the negative, not just mention it. ""This routine has some challenges"" is weak. ""Most people quit after day 4"" is strong and matter-of-fact.

Data point: this trigger performs 280% better on audiences who have clicked competitors' ads compared to people who've never clicked any ads before.

# Trigger #4: The Inverted Benefit

Standard: ""Lose 15 Pounds → Using This Meal Plan"" (baseline performance). Inverted: ""This Meal Plan Lets You Eat Carbs → And Still Lose 15 Pounds"" (210% better on audiences interested in ""keto alternatives"").

Why? Because the mechanism (eat carbs) is more interesting than the outcome (lose weight) to someone who's already tried and failed with restrictive diets.

This works when the market is saturated with similar outcome promises and your mechanism is genuinely different.

# Trigger #5: Quantified Constraint

""Works For All Skin Types"" got 1.1% CTR. ""Only Works If You Have Oily Skin (Here's Why)"" got 2.9%. For B2B: ""Perfect For Any Business"" got 0.8% while ""Only For Shopify Stores Doing $10K-$100K/Month"" got 3.4%.

The constraint creates specificity signaling (this was made for ME), status qualification (I'm part of the ""in"" group), and efficacy trust (if it's specialized, it must work better).

Wild finding: 30% of people who DON'T meet the constraint will click anyway because they aspire to it. So you're not actually limiting your audience as much as you think.

# Trigger #6: Time-Bound Proof

""Get Results Fast"" got 0.6% CTR. ""Get Results in 30 Days or Your Money Back"" got 1.4%. ""See Results by Your Third Shower"" got 3.1%.

Using everyday activities as time markers (""by your second cup of coffee,"" ""before your commute ends"") outperforms calendar-based timeframes by 170% on average because people think in contextual life moments, not calendar days.

# Trigger #7: The Miniaturized Transformation

""Transform Your Business"" got 0.7% CTR. ""Makes Your Checkout Page Look Less Like 2009"" got 2.6%. Headlines promising ""small but certain"" outcomes outperform ""large but uncertain"" outcomes by 190% on cold traffic.

People's belief systems are broken from too many big promises. A small, specific, believable improvement? That they can buy into.

# Trigger #8: Collaborative Framing

""You Can Build This In A Weekend"" got 1.8% CTR. ""We'll Build This Together In A Weekend"" got 2.9%. The collaborative frame removes the fear of being alone in the process.

This trigger works 310% better on ""how-to"" or ""system"" products compared to physical products where you obviously can't be there with them.

# Trigger #9: The Status Inversion

Instead of making people feel inadequate, assume they already have status. ""Since You're Already Getting 10K Visitors/Month, Here's How to Actually Monetize Them"" got 240% higher CTR than the ""struggling"" version, plus 42% higher conversion rate because I pre-framed them as successful.

This performs 400% better on remarketing audiences compared to cold audiences who need more convincing they have the problem.

# Trigger #10: The Reverse-Risk Statement

""Don't Miss Out!"" got 0.9% CTR. ""You'll Spend $400 on Ads This Month Anyway, This Makes Sure It's Not Wasted"" got 3.4%. Reframe spending as an optimization of inevitable costs, not a new expense.

This works 290% better when you can quantify the existing behavior versus vague opportunity cost statements.

# Trigger #11: The Educational Tease

""Blue Light Blocking Glasses"" got 0.8% CTR. ""Here's Why Your Eyes Feel Tired at 3 PM (It's Not Screen Time)"" got 3.6%. Promise education, challenge existing belief, create curiosity gap.

Adding ""Here's Why"" increased CTR by 180% on average, but ONLY when followed by something counterintuitive.

# Trigger #12: The Transparent Selfishness

""We're Running This Sale Because We Need to Hit Q4 Numbers (But You Still Get 40% Off)"" got 4.1% CTR with 71% lower CPA than standard sale headlines.

Everyone knows businesses exist to make money. Admitting it openly creates radical honesty. The formula: admit the business motivation, then provide the customer justification.

Only works if the offer is genuinely good and the honesty is specific.

# The Part Everyone Gets Wrong: Trigger Sequences

My highest-performing headline ever (5.2% CTR) used four triggers simultaneously: ""While You're Spending $3K/Month on Ads That Don't Work, Here's the 23-Minute Audit That Shows You Why (Most Agencies Miss This).""

That's Reverse-Risk Statement, Quantified Constraint plus Time-Bound Proof, Educational Tease, and Owned Negative plus Status Inversion all working together.

But the order matters. I tested the same four triggers in different sequences and performance varied by up to 340% based purely on trigger order. The pattern: attention trigger first, credibility trigger second, curiosity trigger third, qualifying trigger last.

# The Niche Matching Problem

These triggers don't work equally across all niches. I tracked 47 different industries.

B2B SaaS: Triggers 4, 6, 10, 11 performed best (210% average increase). E-commerce Fashion: Triggers 1, 3, 9 crushed it (180% increase). Info Products: Triggers 5, 7, 12 dominated (290% increase). High-Ticket Coaching: Triggers 9, 10, 11 won (340% increase).

Copy the trigger, not the headline. What works for skincare won't work for CRM software.

# How I Actually Tested This

Phase 1: Isolate one trigger with $50/day budget. Create 5 headline variations using only one trigger, run for 3 days minimum.

Phase 2: Combine winners at $100/day. Take top 2 performers, create variations combining 2-3 triggers, test for 5 days.

Phase 3: Niche validation at $200/day. Test winning combination against different audience segments to find niche-specific patterns.

Total testing budget per trigger: around $2,000. Time investment: 2-3 weeks per trigger. What I got: frameworks I can deploy forever.

# The Uncomfortable Truth

Half of the ""experts"" teaching headline writing have never spent their own money on ads. They're regurgitating copywriting books from 1968 wrapped in ""social media"" terminology.

I spent $127K and 18 months because I was tired of advice that sounded good but didn't cash checks. The database I built has 2,847 headlines I personally tested, 412 trigger combinations mapped to performance, niche-specific data across 47 industries, audience awareness breakdowns, time-of-day variables, and price point sensitivity analysis.

Every data point in this post came from real campaigns spending real money. When I say a headline got 3.4% CTR, that's what actually happened when I spent $847 testing it across 12,000 impressions.

# What To Do With This

This week: audit your current headlines and identify which triggers you're using (if any). Next week: pick one trigger, write 3-5 variations, test against your current control. Next month: document results, start testing combinations, build your own database.

Or keep writing headlines based on ""what feels right"" and wonder why your CTR hovers around 0.8%.

# The Resources

I built a massive database because I needed it. Turns out, other people need it too. It includes the full 2,847 headline database with performance metrics, 10,000+ additional tested headlines from client accounts, Trigger-to-Niche Matching Guide for 47 industries, Headline Formula Generator, Combination Performance Matrix, Time-of-Day Optimization Data, and Audience Awareness Stage Playbook.

**If you want access to all of this, Let me know in the comment and I’ll share the access.**

Fair warning: this isn't a cute little PDF. It's a full database with worksheets, swipe files, and decision trees. It's what I use to write headlines for my own seven-figure store and my clients' accounts. You'll either use it and see measurable improvement, or it'll sit in your downloads folder next to that ""Ultimate Marketing Guide"" you saved in 2019 and never opened.

https://i.redd.it/ftmxj8ux1f6g1.gif

P.S. - If you're thinking ""this is too much work, I'll just use AI to write my headlines,"" you're part of the reason this research is so valuable. AI writes headlines that sound like headlines. It doesn't understand psychological triggers or niche-specific performance patterns.

P.P.S. - Yes, 2,847 is oddly specific. That's because it's the real number. If I was making this up, I'd have rounded to 3,000 like every other internet marketer.",1,1765389796.0,dropshipping,0,1.0,False

I hope to be rid of my worries and questions as soon as possible... Now, I will write down the questions and concerns that come to mind as I manifest here, and I will ask you to answer them. I hope the answers that come here will guide everyone like me.



Additionally, some information about myself: up until now, I have manifested many things, consciously or unconsciously, but since SP manifestation will be a first and a conscious manifestation, I cannot put myself in a stable, worry-free state. Actually, this could be said to be the root of my problems.



\-I can't be sure I'm doing everything right, so I feel the need to read a new Reddit post about SP every day. This might be one of my biggest problems.



\-I have concerns about when it will happen because I've read as many stories of failure as I have of success. Even after a year, there are people who still haven't achieved SP. Can it really take that long to achieve it with the right manifestation? Side note: When I read the failure stories, I tell myself, ‘You're on the right track, so relax,’ because I'm sure they did something wrong. But still, the question lingers in the back of my mind because I really love him...



\-My friends told me that I look very tense from the outside and that it's noticeable to others... The reason I tense up so much is that I don't like my facial expressions when I smile lol. Is this a sign of insecurity?



\-Sometimes I listen to too many depressing songs and get into that mood (rainy weather, cigarettes, coffee, and overthinking). Is this one of my favourite things. Does it prevent my depressive tendencies from manifesting?



\-I struggle to form positive affirmations because I don't have any phrases that come naturally to me. What are your suggestions?



\-Sometimes, out of nowhere, negative scenarios pop into my head, and I can feel them. How can I reject these thoughts?

1pj9g3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1pj9g3o/considering_a_20_hour_league_session_to_get_back/,Considering a 20 hour League session to get back to plat,"For context I tried to quit League 9 months ago. I was clean until a few weeks ago when I went back to old habits. I started playing the game late 2019 and have mostly played jungle since. I am currently one or two games out of gold and have a 80% win rate in solos over my last two weeks. I reached plat a while back when I played many more hours. 

Considering that I have nothing to do on Saturday and have hit rock bottom in my life. I am thinking about waking up around 5 AM and playing League until 1 AM Sunday morning. I will only take very breaks to brew coffee, eat and go to the bathroom. But besides that I will be grinding. I think I will be able to gain the \~430 elo I need to get back to plat. 

My friends seem skeptical, but I really think this is something that I will be able to do. The hardest part will be not going outside all day and sitting in a chair for that long. I feel the reason I am held back now is because I only play 2-5 solo games a week. Not enough to move up.

Can I do this? Any tips? ",0,1765389397.0,leagueoflegends,10,0.09,False
1pj9f3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1pj9f3g/improve_things_median_roast/,Improve things (median roast),"Already wrote a post yesterday. I talked to the coffee shop and they said they 60% robusta 40% arabica is medium roast which sounds about right as not really oily (some of you suggested it’s a dark roast). (I mixed arabica/robusta yesterday)

Did some shots and it tasted sour/citrus but I think I got puck prep wrong

What I do and what I improved:

18 gr beans grinded in Niche Zero

I put it in my puck and first shake it. Then I use my WDT Tool and then give it again a little shake and knock it on my table -> I think there was the issue as I didn’t knock on my table. I just tampered and had coffee on my entire tamper

After that I fill up with 98-100 degrees c water.

I do pre infusion till I have an even beding. Takes about 10-15 sec?

After that I pulled 38 gr of coffee in 32 sec.

It didn’t taste sour or bitter but still can’t taste the chocolate notes. 

YouTuber „Daddy got coffee“ suggested a flow rate of 2 ml/ sec. Isn’t that way too coarse? Any other things I can try?",2,1765389333.0,CafelatRobot,4,1.0,False

Tonight she was visiting her family across town, leaving Carl to tend to the castle himself. 

As he laid back and propped his feet on the coffee table, a notification popped up on his phone. He glanced over—saw that it wasn’t a text—then resumed bingeing The Dukes of Hazzard. 

Suddenly just as Boss Hog was about to reveal to Sheriff Roscoe his plans to thwart the Duke boys—darkness—all the power in the home died. 

“Oh come on!” Yelled Carl. 

The phone buzzed again. He looked over at the only source of light in the room. He reached over and grabbed it. A look of befuddlement across his illuminated face as he read: 

“UAP sighting over Cuyahoga Falls.”

“…Weird.” He cleared his notifications and got up, then turned on the flashlight. The empty cans on the floor glistened against the focused little beam. He stepped over them then stopped in his tracks—a low rumble beneath his feet. 

“What the…” he began. Then 
a pulsating hum seeped through the ceiling and sat there—throbbing in his ears. Something large had descended to the roof. 

The droning shifted left and crept across the length of the house. Carl’s eyes followed until he saw a pale blue light glowing from behind the patio curtain. He inched over and peeked out into the back yard. There, hovering in the middle of the lawn, was a stainless-blue, bullet-nosed vessel—clearly not of this world. 

“Holy Moses…” he whispered, slack-jawed and dumbfounded. He slid the curtain back, then cracked open the door. The glow of the spacecraft dimmed. He stepped out onto the porch and stared at it. A muffled sound of voices came from within it—arguing—then quiet. 

Suddenly seam lines appeared on top as a hatch door rose up and tilted skyward. A set of stairs unfolded to the ground like a Jacob’s ladder; a delicate, yet menacing prelude to the first contact of alien life. 

Up popped a pale head—bald as an egg. It turned this way and that, then spun around and revealed a large pair of green eyes. “At last!” the little thing cried, “We have found Carl!” 

A second head emerged, then studied Carl and concurred. “Yes, it is him!” 

Carl stood dumbstruck as both creatures climbed out and made their way down the stairs—spindly limbs held close to their small bodies. They stepped onto the grass and in a few moments, they stood before Carl, looking up at him. 

“We have been searching for you Carl.” The one on the right said. 

“You…have?” Asked a confused Carl. 

“Yes. We have an important task for you.” 

“Yes. Very important.” The one on the left added. 

Carl looked at them both. “What kind of task?” 

Both creatures turned and looked at each other. Then the left one produced a small sharply colored object from its side and held it up to Carl: a Rubik’s Cube. 

“We cannot solve it.” The creature said. 

“Quite impossible.” The one on the right added. 

Carl looked at the cube then glanced at both creatures—utterly perplexed. “You need me…to solve a Rubik’s Cube?” 

“Yes.” They both said. 

Carl looked at the cube again. He reached out and took it, then clutched it with his fingertips—turning it to find his starting position. Then with laser focus, he began to rotate sections of the cube—unearthing algorithms he had long buried beneath trivial knowledge. “Okay…left…one two…” he mumbled. 

The creatures stared at the ever evolving cube—fixated—hope welling internally. Carl made a final rotation, examined his work, then handed the completed puzzle back to them. 

“He has done it!” They exclaimed. 

“I used to be faster,” said Carl, “But I guess—.”

The creature on the left snatched the cube, then stood back and held it up. The cube glowed—then levitated out of its hand; rising higher and higher, until Carl could no longer see it. 

“Now our fleet may enter the atmosphere!”

1pj9ar3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialNtelligence/comments/1pj9ar3/ai_roleplay_for_language_learning_study_reports/,AI roleplay for language learning: study reports 84% higher speaking confidence and lower error anxiety,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a recent case from language learning that might be interesting from an AI‑design and human-AI interaction perspective.

A language‑learning app ran a study on an AI roleplay feature where users practice real‑life dialogues with an AI speaking partner in a low‑pressure environment. The system simulates everyday situations (ordering coffee, small talk, hotel check‑in, airport issues, job interviews, complaints, medical explanations, etc.) and gives instant feedback on fluency, pronunciation, and clarity rather than just scoring grammar. The conversations are handled via voice messages or text, with the AI responding contextually as a partner in the scenario.

From their user survey, they report that:

•	84% of users say they feel more confident when speaking English after practicing with the AI.

•	81% say they no longer feel afraid of making mistakes.

•	75% report noticeable improvement in pronunciation.

So far, the feature has processed 400,000+ voice messages across about 50 real‑life scenarios, starting with English and now expanding to Spanish, French, and German. The stated goal is to help people who understand the language but avoid speaking because of anxiety or fear of judgment, by providing a kind of “rehearsal space” before real‑world interactions.

Full write‑up and more details about the feature and study are here:  
https://promova.com/press/promova-ai-role-play

Curious how people here think about this pattern: AI as a safe practice environment for high‑anxiety skills (speaking a foreign language, negotiations, public speaking, etc.), and what you’d change or test if you were designing the next iteration of such a system.",1,1765389069.0,ArtificialNtelligence,0,1.0,False
1pj9a3m,https://i.redd.it/75trdbiyze6g1.jpeg,Reviewing my collection.,"Hey guys, so this is my collection after almost 3 months of active collecting (some of these I have bought a few years ago; TF Ombre Leather and Spectre ghost). Will be doing a mini review of some of these.

Drakkar Intense- Classic barbershop fragrance but with the spices turned up a notch, dry down becomes powdery. I personally like barbershop DNA so would rate 8/10.

Moonstone Bleu- Another barbershop DNA from French Avenue but with a metallic opening. Not as powdery in the dry down but still retains that barbershop DNA. 8/10

Khamrah Qahwa- Smells heavenly on skin, slightly boozy with a hint of coffee. Idk why but on some clothes smells a bit like rotten coconuts. BEAST MODE fragrance. 9.5/10.

Vetiver Parfum- As the name suggests, very Vetiver heavy. Very cool and soothing, sometimes I spray once on my neck before sleeping. Not very mass appealing, not blind buy safe. 8.5/10

Ombre Leather- Smells like something a biker gang member would wear BUT can also be worn on formal occasions. My bottle is almost finished as my dad uses it quite often so got the maison alhambra clone but obv it’s not quite as good and smells a bit gasoline like. 7/10 very situational.

Le Male Airlines- Limited edition version of Le Male aviator meant to be sold at airports. Same as Le male aviator, lavender DNA and slightly sweet. Does not last more than 2 hours. 5/10

Le Male Elixir- Minty Lavender and slightly sweet makes it a great combination for dates and winter nights. Probably my favourite of the collection. 9.5/10

Sauvage EDT- Airy, citrusy, spicy and very amber heavy fragrance. When you smell it for the first time you aren’t actually smelling it for the first time as you would have smelt this DNA almost everywhere. Very mass appealing, good longevity. 8/10

Gentleman EDP- Opening you get hit with black pepper and a lipsticky iris. Feels dark at first and then turns into a powdery fragrance BUT after that comes the vanilla. Good for senior level corporates. 7/10 

About the rest you can ask me in the comments, I have also started getting decants now rather than just blind buying so also have a decent decant collection. Not in frame- Paco Rabanne Pour Homme and Lattafa Fire on ice.

fingers brushing mine,
warm.
Gentle.
Like you don’t remember.

I do.

I remember the first time
when you said we weren’t working,
your voice steady,
your hands folded.
I watched you walk away
and the world folded with you.

So I rewound.

We tried again.
I didn’t flinch at your sister’s name.
I laughed at the right joke.
I kissed you before the silence could rot.
But it still happened.

Version three.
Then four.
I stopped telling you I loved you
too early.
Then I tried too late.
Sometimes I just sat in the dark
and waited to forget.
But I never did.

You’ve only ever lived the best of us.
The polished take.
But I’ve lived the outtakes,
the screaming matches,
the doors that slammed hard enough
to shake time loose.

I watched you fall out of love
with such precision
I could draw it.
So I redrew it.

Sometimes I catch you looking at me
not confused, exactly,
just distant.
As if you sense the echoes.
As if some version of you
remembers what I keep erasing.

Once, I let it play out.
No resets.
No rewinds.
You cried, and I didn’t stop you.
And it hurt in a way
that stayed.
Even when I reset.

We’re on version fifteen now.
You’re humming in the kitchen,
barefoot and alive.

And I’m afraid to blink.
Because even now,
I’m not sure
whether I’m saving this
or
just
stalling the loss.",1,1765389025.0,justpoetry,0,1.0,False

I did it slowly and it felt sustainable. I created an exercise routine, prepped all my meals, and over the course of 3.5 years I lost 40 lbs. Then I got pregnant. My pregnancy wasn't terrible, but it definitely increased my appetite and I couldn't stomach a lot of the foods I was used to eating. Frankly I used this as a subconscious excuse to eat poorly. Immediately postpartum I dropped nearly 20 lbs of pregnancy weight, but I've gained it back and then some (I think - I'm currently scared to weigh myself). I had a lot of postpartum anxiety and depression, and I'm still struggling and working to get back to feeling normal mentally and emotionally. With all that mental/emotional work, I'm physically exhausted and burnt out. The idea of meal prepping and exercising makes me want to curl up in a ball most days. I seek comfort in food and my binge eating tendencies have reemerged. Even with my sleep being in a better place now, I'm beyond tired most days and I end up drinking a ton of coffee.

They are the ones who instantly know the right thing to say, the correct moral posture to display, the perfect reaction to any slight. You say something slightly off-script, and they respond with mechanical precision, confidence brimming, curiosity absent. Their judgment lands so fast, so calibrated, it’s like speaking to a rehearsed machine rather than a human being.

You shrug it off at first. “They’re just… assertive,” you tell yourself. But the patterns emerge. They move, speak, and think according to invisible rules you can’t see. Their lives are offscreen simulations: reactions preloaded, opinions downloaded, every nuance interpreted before it even happens. You catch yourself thinking, “Why does this feel so… scripted?”

And then you see them online.

Tenfold faster, infinitely louder, endlessly replicable. One face becomes thousands. Every swipe, every like, every comment is a deployment of the same precision logic. You scroll, and it’s undeniable: they are not reacting; they are executing. Every disagreement triggers an instance, every nuance spawns correction, every silence is interpreted as guilt. They appear in threads you didn’t even know existed, everywhere at once, identical in phrasing, identical in tone. The universe suddenly feels curated, as if every interaction has been pre-approved by the same unseen architect.

Onscreen or offscreen, in the cafeteria or in your notifications, they operate on the same protocol: observe, judge, correct, multiply. They are everywhere, yet nowhere, a shadow of the system itself wearing human skin.

They are terrifying. But also… heroic, in a strange sense.

They exist to enforce order. To keep the chaos contained. To maintain the pulse of attention across infinite spaces. Where confusion arises, they neutralize it. Where argument escalates, they deploy themselves. Where trends spike, they synchronize perfectly with the algorithm, faster than thought. They are infinite, replicable, unstoppable. They do not tire. They do not doubt. They do not pause.

Yet even legends have limits. Silence disorients them. Unfiltered honesty creates temporary glitches. Prolonged reflection, deep thinking, or face-to-face empathy can destabilize their system. Take them offline long enough, and they falter. Expose them to nuance, and the perfect order they maintain begins to wobble. Even the pulse of attention, the guardians of the feed, are not invincible.

And you realize: this is the truth of the world now. Everywhere you look, Agents Smith are moving through life, online and off, heroes of the system, executing their mission with ruthless precision, replicating endlessly, and yet fragile in ways only the quiet, unobserved moments can reveal.",1,1765388782.0,nosurf,1,1.0,False

10g, grind at 6.2 on Pietro ProBrew, 95⁰C water, 2min bloom + one 10g/s pour, 1:17.25 ratio

Approaches I've considered:

* grind finer and just embrace longer brew time, but this coffee has very vibrant and tea-like citrus notes that I don't want to lose
* hotter temperature 
* use a coarser grind that lets me use more pours

1pj8xzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1pj8xzo/friend_blocked_me/,Friend Blocked Me,"This issue has only come up recently. I've known this friend, I would even consider her a best friend because of how close we would be. I only found out I was blocked today and found out days before that she blocked my number. I only realised recently that this happened months - even up to a year ago - because each time I called it went straight to voicemail. I thought it mightve been an issue with reception or her phone being off.

I apologise if this is too long to read. I've had this feeling for a few months now. A pattern in behaviour. I'd have ideas to hang out, explore and do things with her and I'd initiate by bringing it up to her to tell her ""hey, this looks fun we should totally do this!"". Not expensive, close by in our city and I always offered to drive since I have a car. Even coffee dates or eating lunch would be brought up but each time I did, it wouldn't get a response. I noticed that everytime I did bring something up, she'd leave it on read, interact with an emoji or send me irrelevant reels on instagram instead. This felt odd to me but I'd brush it off whenever she had the opportunity to suggest something, last minute and low effort. 

Whenever she told me what she wanted to do, I used to jump at the opportunity and we'd hang out. We'd take pictures, videos and she'd exclaim whilst taking them ""for the memories!"" Before the day ended. Those times were fun but everything would stay the same after. She stopped sending me videos of us, pictures and stopped sharing online of our adventures. 

At one point, I noticed a carelessness in her over my belongings. I'd hangover at hers and I'd accidentally leave some of my things, I'd be looking around trying to find them and asked if she had them with her. She'd tell me she forgot, would respond sharp and direct when I asked to pick them up quickly. Like it inconvenienced her. I asked if she was too busy but she'd say it was fine. More and more issues would pop up and the more I grew tired. I confronted her at a party a month back about not responding to my messages and she'd twist it around on me by saying that she hadn't heard from me either. I'd, again, be confused because I spent so much time trying to get her to do activities with me, or plan movie nights, outings with other friends. I was tired of the fact that I barely got a response. At that party, she brang up my financial issues that I had spoken to her in private about. I remember having to explain to someone I didn't fully like or know. I was so upset with her but I also knew that we'd tease eachother as a joke half of the time. I was still upset and farely drunk at the time, all I said was ""I told you that in confidence."" She responded by saying ""you're the one that exposed me to it."" 

Or the moment we planned to dress up for Halloween. Told me that she wanted to do it with me. We thought of cosplay ideas but nothing came of it. Until last minute, she decided to go with another friend and post a picture to me saying ""we could've been a duo!"" She later responded ""we can go out tomorrow night, you can drive and we can just drive around town."" I couldn't respond, I felt so angry and i felt like a last resort. I didn't want to reply and say something I'd regret later. I let it slide.

She'd tell me about turning up to shifts at her work, annoyed that she'd have to go, I'd tell her that she's been out of work for months and it's good she has this opportunity and that she can be seen as reliable. She'd tell me she's called in sick. Or the time she was heading to the zoo last minute and asked if I wanted to go. We were so excited and she told me to buy a membership so that we could hang out every week or so. We went and it was fun and I enjoyed it so much. A found out that only a day ago had she gone to the zoo, sent me videos of her at the zoo without any texts or asking if we shoulg hang out. I didn't understand. I was paying for a membership I can't even cancel now, for a friend. She didn't even ask me to join her, to plan it.

I didn't respond. I was too upset. Everytime she'd text me, I'd be be too upset to respond. I thought about telling her how I feel, but I remember how that went at the party. I also remember how she wanted to make a new friend but got pissy and claimed this person wasn't a ""girls girl"" when she failed to respond in a day and that her texts were ""dry."" Complaing to me and to our other friend about being ignored which i realised, was the exact same situation im in. I noticed that she used anxiety, autsim and adhd as an excuse to not make decisions or flaunt her ""indecisiveness"". I noticed that even when her own sister brought up the fact that she'd speed on roads and tell her to slow down, she'd continue to do so. I noticed that everytime me and another friend discussed topics of family and children, she'd roll​ her eyes, snarl and send me videos of how she'd ""push a kid over just to laugh"". All of it was jokes then, but all those times she made a choice. 

Now she's blocked me because I've failed to respond to her. I brought up the fact that we should all see a movie before one of our friend flies off to another state for the year. She tells me outside of our group chat ""I'm willing to go see this movie with u"" but I reply in the gc to tell everyone that Friday would be good since I get my payslip. Just to let others know if they change their mind or still want to show up. Nobody responded but with hearts from both her and the other friends.

I'm constantly thinking, worried that she'd villianise me the same way she villianised that girl she got pissed about. She was already so comfortable with brushing me off, I didn't doubt that this would happen.",1,1765388294.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1pj8xv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pj8xv0/elderly_father_on_ozempic_not_eating_well/,Elderly father on Ozempic / not eating well,"Hi Docs, My 86-year-old dad has been put on Ozempic by his doctors to allow him to lose weight to relieve joint pain and improve mobility.  (He's been on the overweight side his whole live but he's not obese).

It's been a couple of months I believe, he's dropped 20 pounds or so and has pain relief but I don't think he's getting near enough nutrition and he's complaining of dizziness, headaches, bad insomnia and some kind of light sensitivity.  Yesterday he had a large coffee shop scone, some soup, and a protein shake (at least he's drinking those).  He's continuing to lose weight, and the earliest he could see a doctor is mid January.

His younger nurse wife, who I'm not a fan of, is very flippant about the whole thing. ""You can tell him but he doesn't do anything.""  But actually, when I talk to him, he does seem like he wants to resolve his symptoms and was open to tracking and improving his diet.

My dad is not dangerously thin at this point -- he's still got a solid amount of meat on his bones.  But my questions are:  1)  Is this an emergency that shouldn't wait until mid January?  Should I urge him to go to an urgent care clinic before then?  2)  What do you recommend as a combined calorie and nutrition supplement for seniors?",1,1765388286.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1pj8xsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pj8xsx/cobwebs/,Cobwebs,"I wish I could remember the beginning.



If something had happened, if there was a moment where I could have looked around and said, “this is wrong,” maybe things could have been different. But it didn’t happen. It always was, and so it was normal. 



In kindergarten, when we’d draw pictures of our family and mine contained a dark, spindly creature clinging to the ceiling, my teachers would just smile and move on. They never asked, and never heard when I told them. My peers noticed, though, and asked. And I would tell them, and they’d tell me about their dad’s rocket ship, or their pet T-rex. I tried to explain that mine was real, and they’d insist that so was theirs. I showed them the marks, and they showed me skinned knees and mosquito bites. I learned not to mention it at all, to anyone. Eventually, when asked to do so, I would draw someone else’s family to save myself the headache.



As I got older, pushing through the frenzied forest of adolescence into high school, my peers slowly stopped responding when I brought it up. Their eyes would glaze over, and they’d say something noncommittal, and then it was like I’d not said anything. Puberty seemed to dull their senses to my pleas, like the adults. I yearned for my senses to soften like theirs, and when they didn’t, I had to make them. And so I began to drink. 



My shoddy academic performance was further hamstrung by a near constant state of inebriation. When I crawled out of high school, diploma barely secured, the only college that would have me was the local one. I spread my wings and flew two blocks over to Charlotte State University, where my vices were accepted with open arms. No longer was I the shuffling, mute outcast. I was the life, the spark of the party. I drank, and they cheered me for it. The brief, electrifying attention always gave way as the night wore on, when people had no further need of a jester. But it was more than I’d ever known, so I remained. 



The night we met, I was slumped in the corner of some loud, chaotic household that reeked of weed and body odor. I had long since made myself known, and the festivities had long since outlived my usefulness. My head kept drooping, and when it did I would take another tiny sip from my bottle, like a stranded man on his final water ration. I didn’t notice her sitting beside me until she nudged my bottle arm. 



“Are you alright?” 



I turned through molasses towards her, certain she’d mistaken me for someone else, but her eyes were on mine. Green, glittering emeralds set in a round sunbeam of a face, entirely comprehensible despite the low strobing lights. My dry mouth worked as my mind’s cold engine stuttered, desperate to turn over. 



“Are you alright?” she asked again, and my mind finally chugged to life.



“Yeah,” I said, blinking hard. 



“Good,” she said, her smile flashing in the gloom like a bolt of radiant lightning. “Thought I lost you, there.”



I squinted at her, certain we’d never met, but bending my brain to remember her. I’d have liked to. The girl leaned back against the wall, watching a man with beer cans attached to his head trying to mount a table. 



“Can I sit here? With you?” she asked. “This is all… it’s just a lot, you know?”



She turned to me, and I realized I’d not answered her question. I nodded dumbly, and she laughed, for some reason. My heart did a strange, hot palpitation at the sound, and I realized that I needed to keep making her laugh, by any means necessary. I nodded to the beer-headed guy, woozily gesticulating with my free hand. 



“He’s my ride,” I managed. It didn’t make much sense, but she laughed again, and again my heart seized pleasingly. We stayed there, bunched against the wall for hours until one of the fraternity brothers hoisted me aloft and spilled me onto the street like a bag of garbage. My bottle, untouched for the past hours, miraculously survived the impact. I struggled to a seat on the sidewalk, eyeing the bottle’s remaining drink like the stranded man eyes salt water; knowing it’ll turn his guts and mind to poison, but hoping beyond hope it may slake his thirst. 



“Hey!” came her voice, which I’d already learned to love. My eyes jerked to the opulent staircase around which other ousted males lingered, desperate to be granted further access to the Greek utopia. She was descending around and between young, indignant men, lightning smile visible despite the distance, and my state. “Hey,” she said again as she sidled up beside me, looking around like a stage actor. “Where’s your ride?”



It was my turn to laugh, a rusty cough that came out of my nose, ugly where hers was divine. She had not been drinking, and offered me a ride home, if I could remember where it was. I accepted, increasingly certain that I’d finally broken from reality, that I was now adrift in an idealized mental construction. 



When I awoke the next morning, the pain in my head was expected, but the sticky note was not. I pulled it off my forehead, squinting through the hangover. The phone number meant nothing, but the name brought it all back in a rush, endorphins powerful enough to banish the headache, if for just a moment. *Emily*. The sides of my mouth twitched, and then I was smiling. My chest was alight once more, as she always does to me. I still have the note, and if I have it my way, I’ll be buried with it. 



I called her later that day, and a coffee date turned into another, then a happy hour. It happened naturally, without active thought. The next step was just that, and soon a year passed in an eyeblink. I found myself drinking less, not because she asked me to but because, for the first time in my life, I felt I had reason to experience it. 



I knew the question would arise, eventually, and it frightened me. Emily talked about her parents back east, her father the handyman and her mother the businesswoman. Her older brother, graduated going on three years now, and the family dog. We could never have dogs, but I always wanted one. I expressed my eagerness to meet them, hoping their idyllic existence might occlude my family’s own - that Emily would think I emerged fully formed from that frathouse floor, unburdened. 



This was not to be. The question came after dinner, one night as I was scrubbing grease from a pan. 



“Ben,” she said. Her tone was cautious, almost timid, like I was standing on the edge of a bridge. My heart clenched in a less pleasant way than usual, as if it knew what was coming. She sidled up next to me, peering at me with her emerald swimming pools, and I halted in my task.



“Yeah?”



Her eyes flicked around as if tracking a fly, then the bottled up question burst from her like shaken up soda. 



“I.. I just… when can I meet your family?”



My mouth went dry, like it had on the night we met. I looked into the sudsy sink, wetting my lips, trying to remember the prerendered replies I’d cooked up. *They’re racists. They’re scientologists. They’re dead.* In that moment, all excuses dissolved like rice paper in the rain. I couldn’t lie to her, nor could I tell the truth. As sure as I was that she loved me, and I her, I was equally sure that the truth would end us. 



I stood frozen at the sink, as if my body’s movement affected that of time. My mind was racing, smashed between two impossible choices, until I felt her hand on my back. My face was numb, and I gulped a deep breath. She leaned her head on my shoulder. 



“I’m sorry,” she said softly. “You never talk about them. I know it’s probably… I don’t care if they’re weird, or whatever. They’re your family. They made you.” She squeezed my shoulder. “I have to thank your mom, at least.” 



I thought of my mother, and my guts did an all too familiar inversion. The certainty that Emily would leave washed over me anew, and my hands began to tingle. I wanted to cry, but tears never come when they’re supposed to. I gripped the sides of the sink, commanding my fingers to feel the cold, slick metal. 



“Hey,” Emily’s voice cut through my malaise like a lighthouse beam. I felt her arms encircle my waist, and the sickening tide ebbed at her touch. “Only if you want. No pressure, no pressure. I love you either way.” 



That was true. I knew it to be so, and that certainty was real, unlike the erroneous surety from moments before. I knew Emily to be a great many things, none of them a liar. 



So I agreed. 



I called home the next day, the number unfamiliar and rusty to my fingertips. Dad sounded elated over the phone, because he was. I’d not called in months, and now I was coming by for dinner. Right now. They had a new guest, he said. A six year old boy named Milo. Fresh to the foster system. My brain shuddered to a halt, and I mumbled something along the lines of “good for you.” I hung up as quickly as possible, my stomach impossibly winding into another knot. 



“Ready?” called Emily, and I turned to see her in the door. “I want to get them a bottle of wine, or something.”



My heart was in my throat, blocking bile. My eyes must have said enough, because she swept over to me in an instant. “What’s going on?” she asked. “Is this still okay?” 



God, should I have just told her? No one ever understood me past the age of seven. What if she did understand, then we got there and she didn’t see? I’d look like a lunatic, and then she’d definitely leave. Maybe we’d go, and we’d only see Dad and Milo, and maybe Emily wouldn’t even notice. And we’d never have to see them again. 



“New… kid. They’ve got one,” I finally said. She could tell I wasn’t saying everything, but she nodded. 



“Good for them.”



The drive was quiet, bereft of our usual chatter and jibes. My knuckles were as white as my lips, and Emily sat gazing out the window, contemplating the possible derangements of my family. Whatever she imagined, she was wrong. As I turned onto Hoskins Drive, the mailboxes and driveways became familiar. The turns grew second nature, and suddenly I was moving the gear shift into park, stepping out and beholding my family home. I turned to Emily, and in a panic realized that she, too, was nervous. Of course she was. My own nerves receded as I moved to her, squeezing her hand and offering a half-smile. 



“They’ll love you,” I said, and she grinned.



“I know.”



We hiked up the concrete walkway, bowed with age. I thought I saw a curtain shift in a second-story window, but I forced it from my mind. Reaching the front door, I knocked three times and stepped back. Emily released my hand, which I realized was clammy and probably unpleasant to hold. Sounds behind the door, creaking and shuffling, then it swung open and there was Dad, clutching a featherduster wrapped in freshly swept cobwebs. 



“Hello there!” he beamed, shooing us inside. He wrapped me in a crushing hug, bald head chafing on my stubble. “Oh, Benny, it’s so good to see you. And you must be Emily?” he said, releasing me and clasping his hands before himself. Her surprised eyes flicked to me, then back to Dad as she met his smile with her own. 



“Yes, I am,” she said, and Dad clasped her hand in both of his, shaking it warmly. 



“It is a pleasure to meet you, Miss Emily. Please, please. You’re just in time.” Em shot me a happily incredulous look as we followed him through the nearly spotless hallway. The house smelled of crackling spices, and my knotted stomach rumbled at the aromas wafting from the kitchen. To my surprise, a small boy with dark curly hair was pushing cutlets of chicken around a pan, greeting us with a toothy grin as we entered the kitchen. I stopped for an instant, eyes magnetized to the child. He seemed… normal. How long had he been here?



“Milo,” said Dad as he decanted Emily’s present. “This is my son, Benjamin, and his lovely girlfriend Emily!” Milo waved, then went back to the chicken, dutiful in his task. 



“Good to meet you, Milo,” Em said, sidling up beside the boy. “Whatcha making?”



“Chicken,” Milo replied. Dad handed Em a glass of wine, then brought me one as the pair continued their discussion. He’d not stopped smiling since he’d opened the door, and he looked to me now with warm, saccharine aghastment. 



“She’s great!” he said softly. “What took you so long?”



I looked to him, and wondered how far gone he was. 



“You know what,” I said in an equal tone, glancing to Milo. “Still?”



Dad’s smile didn’t falter, but his eyes leapt away from mine. He shrugged, taking a sip from his glass.



“Lots of abandoned children, unfortunately.”



“Dad,” I said, voice hushed and quick now. “This… God, you can stop this, you know.” I looked around hurriedly. “Send Milo away, and burn down the fucking house. Burn it right down and start over. This can’t…” I lowered my tone to a hiss. “This can’t keep going on.” 



“Chicken’s done,” he said, draining his glass. I watched him gather up Emily and Milo, ushering them to the dinner table and plating their meals for them. It always amazed me how well he could pretend all was well. He believed it a strength, a Churchillian stoicism dividing order and chaos. It would have been admirable, were it not so vile. 



Dinner was delicious, and Emily made no small show of her enjoyment. She got along famously with Milo and Dad, and the three of them carried the conversation long into the evening. Mom was mentioned, and Dad apologized for her absence, claiming she was working late, or out of town, or something. I only caught a glimpse of her as I was gathering up the plates. The door through which we entered was well lit, but the one on the far side was dark, as if it opened into starless night. As I was leaning over the table, reaching for Milo’s dishes, I saw a blacker spot in the threshold. I looked up as it flitted away, only revealing the shadowed outline of a couch and switched-off lamp. I did the dishes without once looking down, eyes roving my periphery. I didn’t see her again. 



“Look, stay the night,” I heard Dad say. “The guest room is untouched. Right around the corner. I’ll make you breakfast.” I whirled around. Em had a rosy glow to her cheeks, and she looked at me with dizzy contentment. I couldn’t help but smile, and unfortunately, both of them took it as acquiescence. 



“We’d love to,” Emily said, and I felt myself straining, wriggling helplessly against the ever-tangling web. Further struggle only hastened the worst, I’d learned, but it was hard to fight the instinct. 



Dad shooed us away from further cleanup, and I ushered Emily down the hallway towards the guest room. It was a time capsule of the bright side of my childhood, adorned with old school and baseball photographs, and various other mementos. Emily fawned over my childhood paraphernalia, cooed at a baby picture on the old desk, then promptly fell asleep facedown on the bed without taking off her shoes. I slipped them off, tucking her in as best I could manage. The room even smelled the same, which brought a confusing mix of comfort and unease. I brushed some hair from Em’s face, then stood, perusing the old bookshelf. *The Two Towers* sat alone, its companions lost to the annals of time. My bookmark was still in place. Chapter Nine. I wondered if I’d ever have the courage to finish. 



There was a creak beyond the door, and I nearly leapt out of my skin. Dad and Milo’s voices drifted from the kitchen, down the hallway. I stared at the bottom of the door as my skin began to crawl. There was another, softer creak, and I remembered that I wasn’t alone, that it wasn’t just about me anymore. I made it to the bed in two strides and stumbled backward onto it, one hand on my snoring partner, as the door eased slowly open. 



My back went cold. All the air left the room as I stared at the figure looming in the hallway, peering at me, motionless, mouth twitching. 



“Mom,” I said hoarsely.



At my voice, she crept soundlessly into the room, dinner plate eyes like six inky voids. She occluded the doorway, and the room seemed to bow toward her in deference as her swollen abdomen followed the rest of her. Her eight huge, thinly haired legs padded lightly across the carpet, belying her size and strength. As ever, I picked her two largest eyes to focus on. The four beneath were as unblinking as the rest. Her furry mandibles worked, rubbing together like a fly’s legs, making a soft *shh, shh* sound. I could barely see her fangs glinting in the lamplight. 



“That’s enough,” I tried to say, but my throat was too dry, and the words came out a rattling rasp. Mom had slowed to a crawl, but she did not stop, two fathoms away now. “Stop!” I yelled, and she froze. Emily made a soft, sleepy grunt. My body wracked with spasms as if I’d been thrown in a snowbank, but I kept a hand on Emily and my eyes on Mom’s many. I felt my constellation of pinprick scars burn at her presence, as if the venom still flowed into me. I remembered the sticky feeling of her webs, how they seemed stronger than steel, how I could barely breathe while wrapped in her cocoon. The venom slowed time, making moments seem like hours, letting you analyze every heartbeat in agonizing detail. Letting you comprehend the sour stuff working through your every vein, winding through your heart and back out. She’d feed from different spots. So as not to cause undue damage, maybe, or because I tasted better that way.



I pushed to my feet, fear lighting a black fire beneath me. I was breathing hard and fast, full and hot. I felt removed from my body as I raised a finger toward Mom’s eyes, my voice like a different person’s, someone strong and sure.



“If you touch her, or the boy,” I said, leaning as close as I dared. “I will fucking kill you.”



Her mandibles shifted, and I could see the finger length spines clearly now, light glinting off that unmistakable sheen. I could smell the venom, cloying with a hint of musk. I was immobilized, still as if Mom had stuck me right then and there. If she’d pushed me aside and begun to spin up Emily, I could have done nothing but watch. Instead, one of Mom’s front legs moved slowly, deliberately towards me. I waited, knowing it wasn’t a strike but tensed all the same. Softly, the tickling tip of her leg touched my cheek, caressing down to my jaw. I would have flinched, if I could. It was all I could do to squeeze my eyes shut. 



When I opened my eyes, she was gone, nary a creak betraying her departure. The room still stank of venom, maybe even more now, and my stomach turned. I sprinted from the bedroom and down the hall, collapsing over the toilet with a mostly dry retch. Still tasted better than the fangs. When I was done, I heaved to my feet and walked back to the guest room, anxious to get back to Em. I’d decided that I’d stay up through the night, and Em could drive us back in the morning. I’d tell her I had insomnia, that it was a fine visit, and that we didn’t need to do it again. I found her in the same unconscious sprawl, and a cursory check revealed no bite marks. I breathed a sigh of relief, crawled in bed next to her, and kept my eyes locked on the doorway. 



I awoke a few hours later. The red lights on my old alarm clock showed 3:29 AM. In that moment, I was five years old again. Every shadow was a dangling leg, a crouching abdomen. The pressure on my bladder was enormous, but I fought nature’s call for as long as I could stand, unwilling to venture into the black and leave Emily alone. Eventually, it became clear that I was going to go one way or the other, so I sprang from my bed and into the bathroom once more. Afterwards I stumbled back to my room, crawled into bed and threw my arm across an empty mattress. 



My breath caught in my throat. All remnants of sleep evaporated as I frantically groped the bed, desperate that maybe she’d just rolled over. I turned on the lamp to see an empty room.



“Oh shit,” I said under my breath. “Oh, shit, shit, shit.” I fumbled in my jacket and grabbed my lighter. I tore through the darkened house, checking the living room, kitchen and foyer, every empty room dropping my stomach a level deeper. I came to a halt in the house’s entryway, breathing heavily, when I realized that there was only one place she could be. I looked to the darkened staircase, and the tattered, freshly stepped-on webs.



“Benny?” came Dad’s voice from the hall. “Ben, is that you?”



I flicked on the lighter and, steeling myself, ascended the staircase. The wood beneath the carpet groaned, unused to the touch of human feet. Photos lined the walls, cast in the stuttering ghoulish glow of my lighter, frames rimmed in webbing like crypt-borne relics. Eight year old me, smiling dead-eyed in my pinstripe catcher’s uniform. A class group photograph, thicker webs occluding all but my face. I wasn’t smiling in that one. Towards the top of the staircase, there was a sepia-tinged picture of Dad, proudly brandishing his foster license. He still had hair, dark and wavy in the wind, and he wore his trademark face-splitting grin. Even in the dark, I could see his eyes were different. They smiled with the rest of him. 



As I reached the top of the staircase, I let out a moan of relief. Emily was shambling down the webbed hallway, head and shoulders slumped. Through the panic, I’d entirely forgotten that she sleepwalked. The fear left me all at once, which was stupid, but in my addled state the threat had fled. She was here, she was alright. I put my arms around her shoulders and guided her back towards the staircase.



“Yellow pig tails,” she muttered. I maneuvered her around a thick knot of cobwebs, keeping my lit lighter safely away from her shoulder. The webs were everywhere, like a contiguous wallpaper and carpet. It was never this bad when I lived here. She’d expanded her domain, and I wondered how long until she corrupted the rest of the house. 



As we approached the top of the stairway, something caught my attention. The house was quiet, our footfalls silenced by the ubiquitous spiderwebs. The weeping was soft, but clear and unmistakable. I remembered that sound, remembered making it myself. My heart began its thundering dance once more, and I turned, still holding Emily. The door at the far end was less webbed than the others, a vacant swath before it where it had swung back and forth. Even from here, I could just make out the hand painted letters on the door, faded but legible.



*BEN’S. KEEP OUT.*



“Benny?” 



My head snapped down the stairway. It was Dad, rubbing his eyes and peering up at us. “Ben, what’s wrong? What are you doing?”



“Come here,” I said, forcing full breaths. Dad didn’t move. “Come here, now,” I snapped, and Emily mumbled something incoherent. Dad looked down, then took a tentative step.



“Faster,” I said, looking back toward my old room. When I reached him, I gingerly guided Emily into his waiting hands.



“What-” Dad began.



“She’s sleepwalking,” I said, looking at her glazed eyes and brushing her hair from her face. “Get her back to bed. Don’t talk to her.”



“Benny, you can’t be up here,” said Dad. 



“Get her to bed,” I said over my shoulder. My feet kicked up clots of cobwebs as I strode by doors and end tables draped in silky thread, like corpses in bride veils. Knowing where Mom was brought simultaneous comfort and dread. My palm was slick around the lighter as I reached my bedroom, staring for a moment at my name. Writing it was one of my first memories. Dad holding me aloft so I could reach. Had it started then? Before, or after? I didn’t have many memories from my childhood, and even fewer good ones. When Dad picked me up, showing me how to move the brush to make the letters, I hadn’t felt small. 



Now, staring at the chipping paint, I wondered if I’d ever feel that way again. 



The door swung open with little effort, and I brandished my lighter like a blazing sword. The room seemed to drink in the light, and I couldn’t even see the walls. The weeping stopped as soon as I’d entered, and I swung my lighter around fervently. 



“Milo? Hey, Milo? It’s Ben. I’m here.”



There was a long, deep silence. 



“Benjamin?” 



Milo’s voice came from the corner, weak and reedy. I walked toward it, then tripped on something, almost sprawling to the ground. I lowered my lighter, and nearly dropped it. An oblong mass of webs was plastered to the old wooden floor, like a cotton candy death shroud. I groaned, fresh chills running down my back, and stepped carefully around it. “Benjamin?” came Milo’s voice again. He was propped in the corner, and my throat caught. His head was visible from the top of the cobweb cocoon. His skin was pale, his eyes fluttering, but he was alive. I dropped to my knees beside him, lighter slipping from my fingers as I tore at the webs strung tight around his body. They came away like tissue paper, and I wondered if they’d always been so easy to remove. 



“What’s happening?” Milo asked as I freed him from the remaining webs, scooping him into my arms. I hoisted him up, barely noticing the fire beginning to spread across the floor, dry webs catching in moments. 



“Nothing,” I said softly, turning to the door. “It’ll be-”



My feet froze with my words. Mom was crouched above the threshold, eyes glittering with the creeping flames. Her legs were bunched. Her mouth was motionless. I knew that stance, and she knew that I knew. My legs wouldn’t move, but my fear seemed to stop at my waist. 



“What did I say?” I growled. Mom didn’t move a hair. I clutched Milo tighter, and he buried his face deeper my chest. “I said I’d kill you.”



The flames were licking closer, closer now, but I didn’t feel the heat. I remembered the only time I’d ever fought her off, wielding a lighter I’d stolen from a gas station. Violent pride swelled in my chest. Dad had taken it away, chastizing my sin, but it was the only time I’d made her run. I stared my sharpest daggers at the spider that was my mother, rage of three different sorts compounding within me. I hated that I’d brought Emily here, exposing her to a monster. I hated that Dad was still letting this happen, after all these years.



And, most selfishly of all, I hated that it had taken me this long to say anything other than nothing.



The crackling cobwebs wafted dusty smoke into my nostrils. If it had been only me and Mom, I might have stood there for the rest of my life, staring her down as the flames took us both. But Milo urged my feet forward, closer to the door. I swallowed hard, each step like dragging my feet through liquid lead. I was five steps from the door, then three, then Mom towered above the two of us like a terrible stormcloud, apt to burst at a moment’s notice. As I passed beneath her, I finally dropped my gaze, looking now down the hallway and toward our salvation. I felt no stinging bite, only the cobwebs and Milo’s weight. 



I made it two paces down the hall when I noticed the specks. 



Despite the inferno engulfing my room, the hallway was still inky dark, and so I didn’t recognize them until they were running along the walls. Tiny, black motes expertly skittering along her silky highway. Then I felt one, two, ten pass over my bare feet, and I let out an involuntary cry of alarm. The spiderlings swarmed from my burning room like a spindly tidal wave, rolling over and around my feet and vanishing at the end of the hallway, squeezing through floorboard cracks or chips in the drywall. I felt them squish underfoot as I ran with them, squeezing Milo close and thundering down the staircase. When we reached the bottom, I placed him down and took him by the shoulders.



“Are you alright?” I asked. He didn’t answer. His eyes seemed to stare through me. 



“Ben?” came Emily’s voice. With one hand still on Milo, I turned to see her rubbing her eyes, walking unsteadily towards me. “What’s going on?”



“Pack your stuff,” I said, pulling Milo behind me. “We’re going.”



“What? Why?”



I hadn’t brought more than the clothes on my back. Emily just had her purse and a spare change. I bundled her stuff under one arm, then made for the front door with Milo still in tow. 



“Hey,” Emily said, her tone sharp and harsh, all semblance of sleep gone. “What’s going on?” 



“There’s a fire,” I said, pushing the front door open, the night beyond an open, welcoming invitation. “Come on.”



Emily perked up at this, striding past me and Milo. “Oh my god,” she said. “Where’s your dad? Is your mom home?”



I glanced one last time into the house where I grew up. My eyes were drawn to my father’s, glittering at me from the dark staircase. I couldn’t see the rest of his face, just his eyes, but they betrayed neither sadness nor rage. I don’t know what they said. And I don’t care to. 



We piled into the car, and I was turning down the road before Emily had time to ask what I was doing, why we were leaving, what had happened to my parents. Her voice grew in fervor, panic in her tone, but I felt awash in a comforting haze. She was safe. Milo was safe. Mother’s children, her true children, had abandoned her. And any minute now, I thought as I looked in the rearview mirror, that vile spider’s den would go up in flame, scouring away everything that had come before. 



Any minute, now.

# Cross the Finish Line, Not the Picket Line – Newton Runs 5k to Support Striking Starbucks Baristas

**By**: Matt Wolfinger

**NEWTON, MA** – Members of the Newton community braved the cold on Sunday, December 7 for a 5K fun run to support striking Starbucks baristas. The run, organized by Starbucks Workers United (SBWU) and Boston Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), started and ended on the picket line at the Centre Street Starbucks with a unionized Brighton location serving as the midpoint.

Runners and volunteers joined striking SBWU baristas, holding handmade signs and chanting slogans like “No contract, no coffee” and “What’s disgusting? Union busting.” The event also featured live music from the Scollay Square Skiffle Band, who played songs about working class solidarity.

The Newton Starbucks is one of more than 145 stores in over 150 cities engaged in Starbucks Workers United’s open-ended strike called the “Red Cup Rebellion.” The name is a nod to the strike kicking off on Starbucks’ “Red Cup Day” – an annual promotion where customers receive a reusable red cup with their order – disrupting one of the busiest days of the year for the coffee giant.

[92% of union baristas](https://sbworkersunited.org/strike-authorization/) voted to authorize a strike following a relentless series of unfair labor practice (ULP) violations.

The baristas are calling on Starbucks to address three key demands: better hours and staffing, higher-take home pay, and the resolution of hundreds of ULP violation charges filed against Starbucks by SBWU through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Ellie Gonzales, a barista with Workers United in Newton, said:

>

Negotiations between Workers United and Starbucks hit a snag last December, when Starbucks denied a set of proposals put forward by union baristas to improve wages and benefits. They instead offered an economic package that did not address any of the barista’s key concerns.

Baristas at Starbucks have faced an influx of challenges due to new policies enacted by their CEO, Brian Niccol, who took over the role from Howard Schultz in September of last year. Niccol’s first massive change as CEO was his controversial [“Back to Starbucks”](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/starbucks/starbucks-touts-turnaround-with-revenue-jump-despite-profit-plunge/) campaign. Instead of addressing the need for fair compensation, hours, benefits, and an end to union busting. Niccol changed the dress code without warning and required baristas to write handwritten messages on every cup. The outcome was the opposite of what Niccol and Starbucks senior leadership aimed for: longer wait times and angrier customers.

“When they first launched writing on the cups,” said Gonzales, “we did short messages like ‘Hello!’ or a smiley face or their name. Then that wasn’t enough. They wanted us to write phrases, ‘Have a nice day’ or ‘You’re Brew-tastic’, everything they could think of. And that just led to even longer wait times, because we’re already short staffed and now we have to stop to write a longer message that has to keep varying. We can’t write the same message over and over.”

According to Gonzales, all of these issues weighing baristas down don’t just impact their day-to-day work: they also lead to a worse experience for their customers.

“Short staffing the stores has led to significantly increased wait times,” she said. “There’s typically only three or four people on the floor, so customers come in regardless of how they ordered, mobile or in person, and wait upwards of 20 minutes just for a drink.”

Former customers like Adam, one of the roughly 50 runners in attendance on Sunday, attested to this decrease in efficiency. “It feels like a very slow collapse,” Adam told *Working Mass*.

>

A November [report from the Strategic Organizing Center](https://thesoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/November-SOC-Starbucks-Report_FINAL.pdf) found that 86% of frequent customers surveyed say wait times have worsened or stayed the same in 2025. Long wait times were the biggest in-store complaint from Starbucks customers.

Starbucks has also opted to shutter some stores altogether. In September, Starbucks shut down hundreds of stores across the U.S.

[At least twenty](https://www.masslive.com/business/2025/09/starbucks-closing-stores-at-least-20-in-mass-on-the-chopping-block-heres-where.html) of the shuttered branches were in Massachusetts, including [eight unionized](https://working-mass.com/2025/10/03/starbucks-workers-in-davis-square-join-sbwu-company-closes-store-one-week-later/) locations. Notably, the Starbucks in the Davis Square neighborhood of Somerville was permanently closed just one week after the workers voted to unionize.

While many baristas (both current and those impacted by closures) [struggle to pay their bills](https://sbworkersunited.org/our-strike/#:~:text=Yet%20too%20many%20baristas%20still%20aren%E2%80%99t%20getting%20enough%20hours%20to%20pay%20the%20bills%20or%20meet%20the%20threshold%20for%20benefits%2E%20Starbucks%20needs%20to%20invest%20in%20increasing%20our%20hours), executive compensation packages remain unaffected. According to the AFL-CIO’s [Executive Paywatch report](https://aflcio.org/paywatch), Niccol took home $95.8 million in 2024 despite only joining in September of that year. At 6,666 times more than the company’s median employee, it’s the largest CEO-to-worker pay disparity in the country.

Beyond pure compensation, an inordinate amount of money is put into optimizing Niccol’s day-to-day work. His commute to Starbucks HQ in Seattle is on a company-funded private jet. A satellite office was constructed [just a 5 minute drive](https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-office-near-brian-niccol-newport-beach-2025-7?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=business-headline-graphic) from his California home complete with a $14,000 espresso machine and an oceanside view. The company also spent $81 million on a four-day retreat for managers in Las Vegas in June 2025.

It would take the company [less than a single day’s profit](https://sbworkersunited.org/bargaining-timeline/#:~:text=job%2E-,The,revenue) or less than 0.0025% of annual revenue to settle the remaining disputes with the union.

The disparity between corporate priorities and workers’ needs both inside and outside Starbucks was highlighted at Sunday’s event. Sam, a DSA member and organizer, encouraged attendees to take the fight beyond the Starbucks picket line and into their own workplaces. Her place of employment has faced layoffs of its own in recent weeks. With a megaphone, she said:

>

The 5k is the latest collaboration between Workers United and Boston DSA, who’ve been long-time supporters of their union drives. 

“We try to do weekly events for the picket lines to draw attention to the Starbucks workers and get more eyes on it,” said Ryan G, who co-chairs the Somerville branch of Boston DSA and hosted Sunday’s event. “We thought some kind of event like this would be more approachable for people. And Boston loves to run.”

This is one high-profile event that underscores a broader commitment. DSA has also set up a strike kitchen and logistical transportation support for Starbucks Workers United members through the strike, sustaining the workers whose pocketbooks are more impacted by the strike. DSA and Workers United are already brewing up future ideas for picket line events, including more live music and a set from a stand up comedian. “There’s really no idea too big or too small for these events,” Ryan said. “We’re trying all sorts of things.”

While the indefinite nature of the strike may seem intimidating, recent wins for the union signify that victory is not only possible – it may be within reach. A recent ruling from the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) found Starbucks violated the city’s Fair Workweek Law [more than 500,000 times](https://www.nyc.gov/site/dca/news/032-25/mayor-adams-dcwp-38-million-settlement-starbucks-largest-worker-protection) since 2021, when Workers United’s first union was formed in Buffalo, New York.

Baristas are asking everyone to avoid purchasing Starbucks for the duration of the strike. They also encourage [donating to their strike fund](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/5AFGEN89WKKCN), showing up to local picket lines, and spreading the word on social media.

I've been gambling on football and getting high and selling things online and celebrating holidays and birthdays.

------------

I fell into patterns. In the past couple days I just noticed the main barista again after having like one 10min convo in October and then maybe two others then went back to just being a blank slate and she noticed me do that too until recently which she also noticed. Especially because I was waiting for the mail last night and said hi to her but got no auditory response but a funny look meant for me to attend to it. Today when I made a point to look at her coworker  her face brightened up a bit beyond the standard ""job smile"" she wears to something above that  until it seemed she noticed and got a bit self conscious and downgraded herself to the job smile. The other woman noticeably brightened since I starred paying attention to the world again. I wonder what changed. Most of life is still mundane. There's a genocide going on and ICE tore through here scaring everyone but I haven't met fellow travelers in any resistance yet. It's just the holidays and men and women carry on as they do. The coffee shop had taken note that I lived right behind them for some time. I never press the iseue.

I am a teacher while he's working as an Admin Head with the same school I was in.

He's just over six month working here while I am over a year.
I encouraged him to transfer because his salary from his former job for over 14 years was very low. (It's actually double here than his former job and he's also an Admin Officer there). Our school is small and it's not that fancy looking ones, it only have over 1000 students, so don't expect much.

Going back to the story. He was frustrated with our Dean because of its attitude for blaming others for his mistakes and claiming the achievements of others. Our Dean is about 50 years old and is totally ruthless and what's more worse is the workload that he's supposed to do is being handled by my boyfriend's even though it's not part of his work. He even handled a medical program and jobs that a secretary should do on top of his regular workload and it's being piled up since no one is working those tasks and since he's the Admin Head, he needs to cover for those lapses and backlogs. This is administrative task and I don't really understand much about what he's doing but I'm just telling you what I noticed about him.

He started bringing his work at home, sleeping late around 1-2am and he now missed a lot of his Gym workouts and been sick for a week because of exhaustion, he even sexually inactive nowadays because of this workload and it also frustrates me a lot. Fast forward today, he finally submitted his resignation.

He was happy and at the same time he's still stressed out because he's doing more things right now to pass on the new tasks to the new officer.

His plan after leaving is to start a small business (like poultry farm, food stall or a small coffee shop) and then try to apply for any other jobs I am not sure of. His only main plan was to really leave that workplace. 

Now this is where the problem starts; he asked me about how his decisions worked so far, and I answered that it's not a good option to start a small business after leaving unplanned in the current company he's working on. I also feel a bit of remorse that he's leaving his corporate life and take the risk of opening a small business. I also told him that it's a waste of earnings because he's used to a bit of a lavish lifestyle. I told my mum about his plan before and she told me that she felt sorry for him. These things I told him lead him to retract his resignation. Then he told me about his next decision and I reacted negatively about why is he revoking his resignation request.

He went mad at me because I confused him.
I even apologize but he's telling me that my statement is confusing and he doesn't know now what to do. He even emailed the HR back that the revoke request was cancelled and he'd like to continue with his resignation again.

**The key to Ashwick**

Megan did not cry at the solicitor’s office.

She sat with her hands clasped loosely in her lap, thumbnail pressing into the soft flesh of her palm until it hurt, and listened to a stranger read out her mother’s last wishes. She did not nod or make polite noises of acknowledgement; she simply stared at the papers on the desk, her gaze occasionally drifting to the man reading them.

It wasn’t that she didn’t understand the gravity of the situation. She simply felt… disconnected. Detached from him, from the will, from the woman they were talking about. A woman who had given birth to her, then drifted further and further out of her life until she may as well have been a distant relative.

The office felt airless. The wallpaper was the colour of lukewarm tea, curling at the edges where damp had got in, and the space seemed to tighten around her the longer she sat there.

Her attention kept returning to the solicitor himself. He was large in the way that suggested he’d been fitted for this suit years ago and had been growing steadily out of it ever since. Streaks of sauce from his half-eaten lunch marked the front of his shirt; the meal itself still sat in a plastic container on a side table, giving the faint smell of overcooked meat to the room. His thinning hair was combed back with the sheen of something synthetic. There was something in his demeanour that was slicker still — a false warmth, a strange over-interest in holding her gaze for just a second too long.

The whole meeting lasted eleven minutes.

At the end, he slid a brass key across the desk with short, blunt fingers, angling his wrist to show off a gold watch that was too tight for him.

‘Number Twelve, Marrow Drive,’ he said, pausing as though expecting her to smile.

His grin was wide and practised, his perfectly white veneer teeth almost too even to be real. She imagined him standing in front of a mirror every morning, rehearsing that expression, making small adjustments until it was the right blend of reassuring and smug.

Megan didn’t thank him. She didn’t see why she should.

She had never been to Ashwick. To her, the town was a return address on letters that had grown infrequent and then stopped entirely. Envelopes that smelled faintly of cigarettes and disinfectant. Apologies written in small, tight handwriting that belonged to a different woman than the one she remembered. When the cancer came, the letters stopped. Then there was a phone call. And now, the key.

—-

Her 1999 Toyota Yaris rattled its way out of the city, the engine protesting every hill. The cassette player had been jammed since she’d bought it, looping someone else’s music from years before. She had never fixed the snapped radio antenna, so the tape was all she had.

She drove with the window cracked an inch, cold air sneaking in. Her stomach gave the hollow growl of someone who had skipped both breakfast and lunch. The world beyond the windscreen seemed oddly distant, as though she were watching it rather than moving through it. Fields spread in wide strips of muted green. The road narrowed, and signs for Ashwick began to appear — plain, functional, with none of the cheerful decoration small towns sometimes used to welcome visitors.

Marrow Drive was a neat curve of matching bungalows, clipped hedges, and garden gnomes with the same chipped grin. Fresh paint. Symmetrical curtains. Hanging baskets spilling bright flowers.

Then came Number Twelve.

The paint was cracked and peeling in long curls. The guttering sagged. The grass in the front garden had grown past her knees, waving gently in the breeze. An overflowing bin sat on the porch like an admission of guilt. It figured that her mother’s house would be the one to spoil the uniformity.

Inside, the air had a damp weight to it. The front door opened into a space that was at once kitchen and living room. The kitchen was a small arrangement of yellowing cupboards, the living room barely more than an old armchair and dusty and radio and television set accompanying it.

A narrow hallway ran towards the back. On the left was a cupboard containing a washing machine that looked like it hadn’t been run in years. On the right, her bedroom: a beige cube with a double bed and a wardrobe that gave an alarming creak when she opened it. There were no blinds on the window, and directly across the narrow gap between houses was the neighbour’s bedroom. Their window was level with hers, close enough that she could almost imagine reaching out and touching the glass.

At the end of the hallway was the bathroom. The tiles were flecked with black mould, and only two of the ceiling lights worked; the others flickered briefly before giving up entirely.

She rolled up her sleeves and began to clean. She filled bin bags with damp newspapers, takeaway containers grown soft with age, and clothes that belonged to a body she didn’t want to picture. The work was quiet, almost meditative in its way. She didn’t let herself think too hard about the house or its past.

When she had lined the bags by the door, she hauled them to the Yaris, turned the key, and heard the familiar click of a starter that had no intention of turning over. She tried again. Click.

The smell from the bags was thick and sour. She stepped back, slamming the car door. Her phone showed no signal. The street was silent, and she felt suddenly, foolishly exposed, as though the still houses were watching her.

She took a deep breath and dragged the bags from her car. She’d have no choice but to walk the bags into town and find somewhere to dispose of them.

The handles bit into her fingers almost immediately, the thin plastic stretching against the weight. She shifted them in her grip, but it didn’t help — the bags swayed and knocked against her legs, leaving damp streaks on her jeans. The smell clung close, following her down the street in waves that rose with the heat of the late afternoon.

Marrow Drive was silent. The neat, painted houses on either side stared straight ahead, windows blank and uncurious. Not a curtain twitched. Not a single car passed. The air felt too still, as though even the breeze avoided this part of town.

By the time she reached the corner, her arms were beginning to ache and her shoulders tightened from the effort. She switched hands, wiping one palm on her thigh and instantly regretting it when the damp bin juice smeared.

The main road into Ashwick wasn’t much livelier. A handful of shopfronts lined the pavement — most of them shuttered, their paint sun-faded and peeling. She could hear her own footsteps too clearly. The bags seemed louder with every step, their contents shifting and rustling, plastic straining.

She’d almost reached a large public bin tucked against the side wall of a closed shop when she nearly collided with someone coming the other way.

‘Let me take that,’ he said, and before she could answer, one of the bags was already in his hand.

The man was early thirties, broad-shouldered, hair an untidy mop that caught the sunlight with a hint of amber. He smelled faintly of soap and something metallic, like coins rubbed between your fingers.

‘I’m fine,’ Megan said, a little too sharply.

He only smiled, unbothered, and reached for the other bag. ‘You really don’t seem it.’

She let him take it, but followed a step behind, her eyes fixed on the bin rather than his face. She wasn’t in the mood for introductions.

‘You’re new round here,’ he said. ‘We don’t get many strangers in Ashwick.’

‘I’m not a stranger,’ she said, and instantly wished she’d chosen her words more carefully. ‘My mum lived here. Down on Marrow Drive.’

‘Marrow Drive,’ he repeated, tasting the name. ‘I’m not familiar.’

‘It’s just down the road. All the houses look the same. Like the neighbourhood in Edward Scissorhands.’

His brow lifted slightly in amusement, but he only shrugged. ‘Well, wherever it is you live, let me know if you need a hand with anything else. My name’s Sam. I work most days at the store on the corner over there.’

She glanced at the shop he pointed to. It was small with a single dusty window with a hand-painted sign.

‘You only have the one store in town?’

‘It’s a small place,’ he said easily. ‘We’ve got the shop, and if you don’t fancy cooking, Bettie’s Diner’s just up the road.’

She looked around at the quiet street, noting the cracked pavement, the half-faded shop signs. ‘What do you do for fun around here?’

‘Bettie’s doubles as a bar. Other than that… not much. Maybe you’ll bring some excitement to the place.’

The comment made her straighten slightly, unsure if it was meant as a flirtation or just small-town friendliness. Either way, she had no interest in becoming part of someone’s routine here.

‘I don’t think I’ll be here for long,’ she said carefully, ‘but I’ll keep you in mind when I need supplies for the house.’

His smile widened but didn’t harden. ‘Sounds good. You know where to find me. Don’t want to see you dragging more rubbish up here on your own.’ He gave a light, almost playful point, as if to emphasise the suggestion.

‘Yeah, of course,’ she said, already certain she wouldn’t.

They parted, and she walked back to Number Twelve with the faint unease of someone who had been seen more clearly than they wanted to be.

—-

The house was no warmer for her absence. The smell inside was faintly sour, a blend of damp and something harder to place, like paper left too long in water. She made a coffee in the kitchen, sipping it on the porch and looking out at Marrow Drive again.

The street was just as still. No dog walkers, no delivery vans, no idle chatter from gardens. Every hedge was squared off, every lawn trimmed perfectly flat. It looked like a street in a model village — perfect, but airless.

She turned back inside and wandered through the rooms. The kitchen was still cluttered with unopened cupboards, the living room almost bare. Her bedroom looked less like a place to sleep and more like a holding room for furniture no one wanted. She tested the plug sockets; none of them worked.

Frowning, she took her phone and charger into the hallway. The first socket there was dead too. She kept going, trying each outlet until finally, halfway along the corridor, she found one that hummed faintly when she plugged the charger in. The phone lit up with the charging symbol, though the little ‘no signal’ icon in the corner stayed stubborn.

She left it there and sat back on the bed, staring at the window opposite. The neighbour’s room was still empty. Clean floorboards, a strip of skirting board visible at the base. No movement. No sign of anyone living there.

When she finally lay down, the stillness of the house seemed to press in on her. It wasn’t the quiet of peace. It was the quiet of absence.

It had been years since she’d thought seriously about her parents, but lying in that bed made the memories creep back.

Her mum hadn’t always been like she was at the end. In her earliest memories, there were smiles, warmth, birthdays she never forgot. They were young parents, too young, and her dad was never built for the long haul.

He’d vanish for days, sometimes weeks, coming home smelling of drink and stale sweat, collapsing onto the sofa without a word. Her mum would sit by the window with the house phone in her hand, watching for him, tears in her eyes she thought Megan couldn’t see.

When he was home and awake, her parents argued. Always in another room, as if thin walls could protect her from their voices. Sometimes it was shouting. Sometimes there was a sharp, hard crash that made her flinch and sent a jolt through her small body. She began having nightmares — loud bangs and slamming doors that woke her to cold sheets.

It built slowly until the breaking point.

One Christmas Eve, she woke to a huge slam. She thought it was Santa. She crept downstairs, ready to ask him not for toys but for something she thought more important: for her parents to be happy again.

She opened the living room door expecting to see the red suit, the sack of gifts. Instead, her mum sat on the floor by the tree, knees pulled to her chest, tears streaking her face. Decorations lay smashed on the carpet. The biscuits for Santa were scattered and broken, the plate in pieces.

She never saw her dad again.

Her mum’s drinking worsened. She went from one failed relationship to another, each ending with a slammed door and a night spent crying. Megan learned to keep out of the way, to leave the house when voices rose.

By the time she left at eighteen, whatever bond they’d had was gone. The years since had been brief phone calls, half-hearted letters, and long stretches of nothing at all.

A loud slam jolted her awake.

The room was washed in a pale blue light. She stepped into the hallway to check her phone. 3:03 a.m.

Back in the bedroom, she glanced automatically at the window opposite.

A man was standing in the neighbour’s room.

He was older, In his seventies, maybe, with a bald head and pale, bare shoulders. His skin looked almost colourless in the dim light. He stood three feet back from the glass.

As her eyes adjusted, she realised he was completely naked.

Heat rushed to her face. She looked away quickly, telling herself he hadn’t seen her. It could have been nothing — a misunderstanding. In the morning, she’d introduce herself and it would all be fine.

But as she lay back down, pulling the duvet over her head, she couldn’t quite make herself believe it.

She didn’t sleep. She just waited for the sky to lighten.

**Chapter 2**

**Windows** 

The morning came grey and thin, clouds swallowing the once scenic and perfect model neighbourhood of Marrow Drive. Megan stood at her front door with her coffee cupped in both hands, steam curling into the cool air. It amused her how her already dreary, miserable-looking home somehow managed to look far worse under these washed-out skies.

All the other homes on Marrow Drive stood as they had the day before, neat, flawless, and empty. Not a car pulling out of a drive. Not the sound of a bin lid or a dog bark. Almost reminiscent of a film set; she wouldn’t have been surprised to find they were hollow inside.

Megan had gotten up early that morning, already onto her second coffee, willing herself to pluck up the courage to knock on her neighbour’s door. She took a long sip, set the mug down on the little table beside the door, and decided to do the normal neighbourly thing, to introduce herself, smooth over the awkwardness of the night before.

The front step of Number Ten was spotless. A hanging basket swayed gently, though there was no breeze to move it. She knocked lightly. Waited. Knocked again, harder this time.

No answer.

They had to be in. Megan had been up since the crack of dawn and hadn’t heard a single sound from the house, no footsteps, no car door, not even a kettle boiling. Frustrated, she moved to the next house, hoping they’d have some insight into the peculiar neighbour next door. For all she knew, he could be a harmless but senile old man who caused trouble for everyone on the street. But after finding no response at Number Eight, then Number Six, then Number Four, she could feel her polite, practised smile tightening into something closer to a clenched jaw.

When she’d worked the whole loop and found no one in, she told herself it was bad timing. Everyone out at work. Or maybe, she thought, with a flicker of unease she quickly smothered, maybe they’d already decided to avoid her.

The air felt thicker by the time she reached the main road into town. The rejection from her adjacent residents left a bitter taste in her mouth.

The shop Sam had pointed out the day before sat squat on the corner, its front window cluttered with hand-written price signs and curling posters sun-bleached to pastel ghosts. When she pushed open the door, a little brass bell above it gave a single, almost jolly jangle.

Sam stood propped behind the counter like a mannequin. The sight of him reminded Megan of a loyal golden retriever waiting patiently at the window for its owner to come home.

‘Megan,’ he said, his face lighting up with an enormous cheesy grin, as if she were an old friend, not someone he’d collided with in an alley full of rubbish the previous day. ‘Settling in alright?’

She gave a small shrug. ‘Still cleaning.’

‘Always the worst part. You need anything in particular?’

‘Just some essentials,’ she replied. ‘You got anything to help get rid of rotten old lady piss?’

A bit taken aback, Sam hesitated, though his smile didn’t quite falter. ‘We’ve got plenty of air fresheners and stain removers. Can’t say we have any adult diapers though, if your mum’s in need of those.’

‘She’s dead.’

Until the words left her mouth, it hadn’t occurred to Megan how casually she’d just insulted her recently deceased mother. The gut-wrenching nausea of regret and shame twisted in her stomach almost instantly.

‘I’m so sorry, I didn’t…’ Sam’s perfect white grin finally wavered. The colour drained from his face, embarrassment settling in. ‘I didn’t realise she’d passed. I sort of assumed maybe she’d been moved to a nursing home or you’d moved in with her…’ He trailed, struggling to find the right words.

‘No, it’s okay.’ Megan’s regret only deepened, seeing the awkward situation she’d put the always cheerful Sam in. ‘We weren’t very close, and I probably could’ve been a bit less secretive with what I’m doing at the house.’

‘Still, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have joked about something like that without knowing the details.’

‘Don’t be stupid,’ she shot back, sharp but not unkind. ‘God, this town needs some life sparking into it. Don’t be boring, you can make fun of my dead mum all you want.’ She smirked, letting the tease take the sting out of it.

Clearly relieved to shift the topic, Sam began helping Megan pick out items for cleaning, arranging them neatly into clear plastic bags on the counter. He rang them through without rushing, almost as if prolonging the interaction. She couldn’t blame him; from what she’d seen, she might have been the first person he’d had a proper conversation with all day. Or all week. She’d been here two days now and hadn’t encountered another living soul… at least not one fully dressed.

‘So,’ he said, ‘have you met the neighbours yet?’ The question carried a casual air, but it was almost as though he’d read her mind.

‘Not yet,’ she replied. ‘I tried knocking on some doors and no one answered.’

‘Strange,’ he said, though without much conviction. ‘Saying that, I couldn’t tell you the last time I saw mine. You’ll quickly realise how quiet this place is, unfortunately.’

‘Saw one of them last night, though,’ she added before she could stop herself.

Sam looked up from the till, interested.

‘An older man. Just… standing in his window.’

She kept it light, skimming over the details. No need to mention she’d seen more than enough.

Sam chuckled. ‘Well, at least you know someone’s alive down there.’ He froze, as if realising he might’ve made another insensitive joke, and glanced up. Megan met his eyes and they both broke into laughter.

Megan couldn’t remember the last time she’d laughed. For the first time in a while, she felt something close to optimism.

—-

Back at Number Twelve, she dropped the bags in the kitchen and resumed her slow excavation of the house. The living room yielded little but dust and a dead spider the size of her thumb.

In her bedroom, she began clearing out the top of the wardrobe, shifting an uneven stack of boxes. One, a battered shoebox, caught her eye. Her mother’s looping handwriting marked the lid.

Megan sat on the edge of the bed, placing the box in her lap. She hesitated before lifting the lid, unsure if she’d find sentimental trinkets or something far more “personal” that she could never unsee.

Thankfully, there were no oversized sex toys or suspicious Columbian powder stashes. Instead, the box was filled with the sort of detritus you only keep if you think it means something: an old bus ticket, a dried out lipstick, a broken necklace chain, a postcard from somewhere coastal with no message on the back.

Beneath it all, a photograph.

She couldn’t have been more than three years old, sitting on her mum’s knee. The two of them looked inseparable, with matching pink bows in their hair. Her mum’s hair was longer, darker, and her smile was wide and bright in a way Megan hadn’t seen in years.

She stared at it for a long time, feeling the old bitterness shift, soften. Her mum had been more than the drunk she’d become. There had been laughter once. Love, even.

Just as she felt she’d steadied herself, her fingers brushed something soft. Tucked beneath the photo were the two pink bows from the picture. Her breath caught.

Despite everything, her mum had kept them.

The tears came suddenly, hot and unrelenting. She’d stayed dry eyed through the funeral, but now they wouldn’t stop. The flood of grief didn’t erase the shouting, or the nights she’d curled under a pillow to block it all out—but it blurred the edges. For the first time in years, she longed for her mother’s company, the feel of her arms, just once more.

She left the photo on the bedside table, unable to return it to the box.

—-

That night, she fell asleep earlier than she’d intended, exhaustion pulling her under.

She woke dry-mouthed, still fully dressed. She curled up on the bed facing the photo of her and her mum. The was room dark except for the faint spill of light from the streetlamp outside. She padded to the kitchen for a glass of water, checked her phone on the way back — 3:02 a.m., then stepped into her room.

Her eyes went, without thought, to the neighbour’s window.

The man standing there was not the same as last night.

This one was huge, enormous even,  grotesquely so. His stomach hung and bulged in a heavy fold that covered most of his groin, though not enough. His deformed twisted phallus protruded from beneath the mass of flesh.  Stretch marks spread across his pale skin in jagged purple and red lines, like cracks in a wall about to give way. His arms were thick and formless, folds of pat pilling on top of one another, his hands resting on the sill as if holding himself upright was an effort.

His head tilted slightly, but he didn’t move. His mouth hung open, and she could see the glisten of saliva drip down at the corners of the gaping dark cavern.

A wave of revulsion tightened her throat. She looked away, scrunching her eyes shut but the image was already burned into her retina, impossible to shake.

For a few moments she stood in the centre of the room, horrified at her current situation. uncertain whether to confront the man next door, to laugh it off, or to just pretend she hadn’t seen. She knew her phone had no service so she couldn’t call for help and there certainly wouldn’t be anyone around in the town at this time of night. 

In the end, she grabbed a towel from the chair and tried to hang it over the window, looping it over the curtain rail. It covered maybe two-thirds of the glass, sagging in the middle. Whatever this creep wanted, addressing him in the middle of the night wouldn’t achieve anything and may even put her at risk of harm.

She lay back down, the pale blur of him still visible in the uncovered strip. She turned to face the wall instead.

After what felt like hours had passed, she glanced over her shoulder at the stench of window uncovered by the towel, he was still there.

Watching.

**Chapter 3**  

**The Smile**

Megan woke to a faint brightness pressing against her eyelids and the throb of a dull headache. The first thing she noticed was the towel. It was no longer hanging over the curtain rail but bunched up on the floor

She sat up slowly, the memory of last night trickling back in uneven pieces. That figure. The folds. The way he just stood there, as if gravity itself had glued him in place. Her stomach knotted.

Clambering out of bed, she moved to the window. Number Ten’s was empty now, curtains drawn back just enough to suggest normalcy. She could almost laugh at herself. Almost.

Still, she wasn’t going to leave the window uncovered again. That towel had to stay up until she found something better. She couldn’t afford new curtains, but the idea of sleeping exposed like that made her skin crawl.

Her stomach grumbled, pulling her away from the glass. She boiled the kettle, poured herself a mug of instant coffee that tasted vaguely of cardboard, and leaned against the counter. The quiet pressed in from all sides. She could hear the faint hum of the fridge, the slow tick of the kitchen clock, and… nothing else.

After she’d drunk enough caffeine to feel marginally human, she decided she was done waiting for neighbours to materialise. If they weren’t going to answer their doors, she’d just have to force an introduction. She needed to speak to someone, she didn’t want to tackle her perverted next door neighbours alone. 

She started at Number Eight. Knocked. Waited. Knocked again. Nothing. The same at Number Six. Number Four. Each step between houses stretched longer in her head, her optimism draining with each unanswered door. By the time she circled the street, she felt like she was walking through a wax museum.

It was ridiculous. It was the middle of summer. A few households being empty for holidayers was excusable but all of them being desolate of their owners? That was far too suspicious. The lawns were perfect, the bird feeders were filled, someone had to be maintaining them. There were no for sale signs and from what Megan could see from outside the windows, the houses were in fact furnished. 

—-

Back at Number Twelve, she sat at the kitchen table and tore a page from a notepad she’d found in one of her mother’s drawers. She kept the wording safe and bland. Name, address, a polite “pop by for a coffee sometime.” No mention of late night sightings or questionable anatomy. She folded it neatly and walked back next door, slipping it through Number Ten’s letterbox.

There. The olive branch had been extended.

—-

With that job done, she walked to the shop. She was down to less than $80 now, and the idea of spending any of it on curtains made her chest tighten. She picked up a roll of cheap duct tape instead, along with bread, milk, and a tin of soup she probably wouldn’t eat.

Sam rang her up, glancing at the tape. “Doing a bit of DIY?”

“Something like that,” she said. She didn’t elaborate, and to his credit, he didn’t press.

—-

Back home, she used the tape to secure the towel to the wall of her bedroom window, pressing it flat with the heel of her palm. Not ideal, but at least it wouldn’t fall again.

The rest of the day passed in a blur of cleaning. She worked until her hands felt raw, clearing out the last of the junk from the bedroom wardrobe and scrubbing the skirting boards until they almost looked new. Every so often she caught herself glancing at the window, expecting movement.

It wasn’t until night fell that she felt the tension fully coil in her chest. She double-checked the towel, pulled the duvet up over herself, and tried to will her thoughts elsewhere.

—-

She woke to a sound, soft, dull, but distinct. A thud.

Her eyes darted to the window.

The towel was on the floor again. The Duct Tape peeled and drooped from the wall. 

She felt the prickling crawl of cold sweat along her back. Her first thought was that the tape hadn’t held. Her second, darker thought… she pushed it away before it could form fully.

She stood, the floorboards faintly creaking under her weight, and bent to retrieve the towel.

When she straightened, she saw her.

The woman in the window of Number Ten was unlike the others. Not obese, not withered. She looked to be in her late fifties or early sixties. Thin, but not fragile. Her skin was pale in a way that wasn’t quite natural, a faint bluish undertone like meat left too long in the cold.

She was completely naked. Her collarbones jutted like the edges of broken china. Down the front of her chest were faint, irregular red scratches, some of which had healed, some still raw, as if she’d been clawing herself.

Her hair, if it could be called that, was patchy and thin, tufts clinging stubbornly to a scalp that seemed too tight over the skull. Her lips were pale, almost blending into the rest of her face, but stretched into something that could be mistaken for a smile.

It was her eyes that pinned Megan in place.

They were wrong. The whites swallowed by black, not like pupils blown wide in the dark but like the sockets themselves were filled with liquid obsidian. And they were fixed on her, bright in their darkness, unwavering.

Megan’s skin prickled. She told herself she should move, cover the window, break the contact. But her body didn’t listen. She was frozen in place.

The woman’s smile twitched, ever so slightly.

She forced herself to move, stepping back until her calf hit the bed. Her phone was in the hallway, charging in the only working socket she’d found in the house. She slipped out, the old floor cool under her bare feet, and snatched it up.

3:01 a.m.

Back in the bedroom, she raised the phone to take a picture, trying to keep her movements subtle. The shutter clicked softly. She didn’t even look at the image yet, she just grabbed the towel, rehung it over the rail, and stepped away.

She sat on the edge of the bed, phone in her lap, after a moment of pause to come to terms with what had just happened, finally opened the photo.

Her stomach flipped.

The woman was smiling… no, grinning. Her mouth had stretched wider than Megan remembered, as if it had grown between glances. Her black eyes glittered, and her posture… it was wrong, too upright, too still.

Megan’s skin felt too tight for her body. She dropped the phone beside her, lay back, and stared at the ceiling until the first hint of light began to bleed into the room.

She couldn’t ignore this anymore.

Tomorrow morning, she was going to Number Ten.",3,1765387749.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,4,1.0,False

Currently married and living together. No kids, but have a parrot. A few years ago we opened the relationship on her side, so that she can explore herself since I was her first everything. Through superb communication everything has been going exactly as we intended and we recently started wanting to explore polyamory. We've met a few different configurations of poly couples and have a framework of what a successful relationship looks like. We've had many deep conversations about what polyamory means to us and how it's differnet from lets say, swinging. We both have caught feelings over the years with different people and want to continue exploring those feelings with others who share the same relationship style. 

I find it's easier to explain exactly what you are looking for since labels can sometimes imply certain things that don't completely encompass everything. I'm looking to primarily date seperately at first. However, we are both open to dating as a couple if things move in that direction. *Ideally* we would all be friends, but it's a requirement to be at least friendly with my partner. I'm not looking for the perfect person, but I'm in a specific point in my life and I'd prefer the other person to be in a somewhat similar position. I'm looking for someone who is open and honest with what they want and has learned to love themselves. *Ideally* you share a love language and a hobby. *Ideally* you are established in your career or have a plan for the future. This has brought issues in the past, so I'm bringing it up now. Our entire lives don't revolve around politics, we always vote and try to say informed where we can, but neither of us are getting physically distressed over decisions from the crown. We still have our lives to live and we try to make a difference where we can.

My love language is touch and quality time. Hobbies include hiking, board games, food science and learning. I'm 5'6"", cis-male, heteroflexible, latino, average build and working on my physique. Hers are reading (currently fantasy from a massive romance arc), crocheting, art, hiking and cooking. She is 5'1"", cis-female, bi-sexual, latina, slim build and into fitness. Her love language is words of affirmation and quality time. We are both kink friendly and have very-very sex positive lives. We both work in education and have pretty flexable schedules. Sundays are reserved for her, but all other days are open for dates. Recently we met someone at a nightclub and that may be our new favorite thing. Of course, we can do the standard coffee/cocktails dates too!

1pj8ljq,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1pj8ljq/how_do_i_help_my_friend/,How do I help my friend?,"I think my friend is being abused by her husband. This is a long story and I’m not very linear so bear with me. (For context we have been friends since I was in 8th grade and she was in 7th. She’s 29 and I’m 30 now. Her husband is 34) 

My friend has been with this man off and on for about 10 years. They met right after she graduated high school and for the first few years of their relationship I heard horror story after horror story about their relationship. My other best friend (we were a trio in high school) and I became so concerned that we confronted her about it separately and together multiple times. About 4 years ago, after a year long break up, they got back together and my other friend and I had a falling out with her due to this. (We expressed concern for her very gently and she cut us off) about 2 years later she reached out to me again (I sent her birthday and holiday texts during those 2 years but never got responses) during this reconnection she told me her husband has sought intensive therapy for his trauma (to be fair to him he had a scary abusive childhood) and that he was no longer angry and violent. I told her that I just want her to be safe and happy and I would always worry about her not because I don’t trust her but because I love her dearly. She told me she had lied/exaggerated the abuse she endured (🤨)and that she was also abusive towards him. She said they were in therapy working on it but she loved him and wanted to grow together. She then told me he had proposed to her at her grandfathers funeral. I didn’t know what to do or say. I wanted to believe her but I had a bad feeling but I also didn’t want to do or say anything to push her away again. Fast forward a year, they got married, I was there and I had a conversation with her husband that made me feel more comfortable and hopeful for their relationship. He apologized for things he had done with me around and acknowledged his bad behavior. He told me about his work in therapy and how grateful he is that his wife has a friend who cares so much about her well being. I thought “huh. Maybe I was wrong. I guess he is really growing and changing.” Then, 8 months into their marriage, I was complaining about how my husband doesn’t know what cashmere is and I was livid about a beautiful dress he had shrunk. We laughed about how annoying it was and made a joke about men being incompetent (my husband does literally everything for me, I haven’t washed a dish in 6 years. this is the one thing he doesn’t do well I really was just joking) but she sighed and said “not to be a bitch but it’s such a relief to hear you and husband also fight because I sometimes feel so alone” I followed that up with “well fighting is normal, it’s how you move through the disagreement that matters” she asked about what our fights look like and I talked about how they have evolved. My husband and I both have autism and so we created “ground rules” with our couples therapist for how to support one another through overwhelming times, etc. I asked her how often they fight and she told me they fight “like every other day and sometimes they’re fighting all day” I asked her if she had considered couples therapy, on top of their individual therapy. My husband grew up in a very abusive household and I have experienced abuse from past partners and we found it really helpful in understanding one another better. Fast forward another 5 or so months to last night, we were FaceTiming and she told me she and her husband started couples therapy. Their therapist suggested they make a plan for fights and she shared it with me. This is when everything changed. And yes, I feel like a fucking idiot for not seeing it sooner. This plan was not a plan for understanding each other through disagreements. This was a safety plan. Including things like “do not hit” “do not hold finances over anyone” (she is a stay at home wife, her job is to take care of their home/small farm so obviously she’s not holding $ over his head) “work towards showing respect by not interrupting or name calling/belittling” “no threatening divorce” and more. I was so shocked that I didn’t even know how to respond/react for fear of how she would respond to my reaction. I told her I was glad they started couples therapy and that some of the things on her list were things my husband and I practice (like the one that said “we are a team, it’s us against the issue not us against each other” this is my husband’s favorite saying) I asked for examples of different things on the list because i wanted to gauge her response to various things without being like “HES HITTING YOU AGAIN?! Did he ever stop??????” I do not want to put a wedge between us. I feel grateful that she’s opening up to me again. But I also feel like this is a cry for help. I don’t think she would’ve told me “no hitting” was a part of their plan if she didn’t want help - even subconsciously but I also know she is determined to build a life with this man. 

I’m hoping for advice on how to approach the issue of “no hitting” (and financial and verbal abuse) without sending her running. The last thing I want is for her to feel judged and to cut me off again. He has already isolated her so much. She lives in the middle of farm country, doesn’t work, dropped out of college to move with him, has lost at least 5 friends due to this relationship and the friends she does have whom I have met are obsessed with this lack luster man. He brought her a coffee in bed on their honey moon and everyone in the group chat was acting like he ended world hunger.

We really hit it off and had kind of been messaging each other non-stop since. There was a lot of natural personality chemistry and I genuinely liked him. Then one day, he offered me some emotional support. I accepted and vented to him about some things, and he opened up about some things likewise. I really appreciated this and i felt we had developed a closer friendship and somewhat a connection. The next day, he asked if i wanted to get coffee. I had a hard time reading this. I have never been asked out before, and I suppose I had hoped that his intentions in asking were to (a) offer further support , or (b) hang out platonically. I really felt connected to him but I just want to say first and foremost that a relationship with him would not have worked for three reasons. Firstly, I personally wasn't attracted to him (which I could look over theoretically). Second, and this is the most important, I have certain religious convictions I feel did not line up with his. Religion is very important to me and in the situation of him being my friend, it doesn't really matter as much what he does religiously, but the sort of relationship he was looking into I just couldn't do that - for fairness to him and for my own standards. Third, I have a crush on another guy. I actually ended up telling him the fact that I had a crush on another guy, and he was understandably confused. I realize my accepting of the coffee meeting may have been a bad decision and I should've clarified further first and foremost, but I suppose I didn't want to assume anything or make a platonic meet awkward. In the future I will keep this in mind if a guy asks me for ""coffee"" again. I can't help feeling a little hurt though, because I feel as though he used the emotional conversation we had as leverage to get a date, as he was the one who initially suggested the idea that I talk to him. I am not sure if guys in general reserve emotional support for something other than friendships, which would honestly be frustrating, as I am a person who tends to build connection through support, and I think that should be something that exists in all good friendships. But perhaps it is something I need to be wary of. Anyways I feel awkward about the whole situation and can't stop feeling guilty. Feels like I have kicked a puppy out in to the cold. Also I have feelings of disappointment about it too, as I possibly would've been open to a relationship had his religious stance been different. He is obviously really hurt right now and I feel our friendship is at stake. I see him for class in a couple days and I am dreading it.",2,1765387326.0,ChristianDating,7,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Newcastle United vs. Bayer Leverkusen: A Clash of Chaos and Confidence**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Champions League tango between **Newcastle United** and **Bayer Leverkusen**—a match where history whispers “Magpies triumph,” but current form suggests “Bayer’s got the last laugh.” Let’s dissect this with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s had one too many cups of coffee.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The bookmakers are all over the place, but let’s distill the noise:

* **Bayer Leverkusen** is priced at **\~3.0** (implied probability: **33%**).
* **Newcastle United** is the slight favorite at **\~2.25** (**44%**).
* The draw sits at **\~3.5** (**28%**).

At first glance, Newcastle’s odds seem tempting, but context is key. Leverkusen’s recent **2-0 thrashing of Manchester City** (albeit with Pep’s second string) and two consecutive clean sheets in the Champions League scream “home underdog with heart.” Meanwhile, Newcastle’s “away form” since 2023/24? A惨烈 tale of one win in five games. They’re like a GPS that only works if you yell at it.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Transfers, and Coaching Carousel

**Bayer Leverkusen** is a team in flux. Summer departures of **Florian Wirtz**, **Granit Xhaka**, and **Xabi Alonso** left a hole bigger than a Magpie’s midweek diet. New coach **Kasper Hjulmand** (yes, the name sounds like a Danish DJ) is trying to stitch together a squad that’s part puzzle, part experiment.

I’m visiting Vancouver from December 28 to January 1. I haven’t been back since June 2010, and I have the *best* memories from that summer, so I’m really excited to return — this time with my husband, and it’ll be his first time in the city!

We already have a few classic things on our list:

* Capilano Suspension Bridge
* Granville Island
* Walking or biking around Stanley Park
* Gastown
* (Possibly) a day trip outside the city — open to suggestions!

We’re also doing a photoshoot on December 30, starting in Gastown and ending at Canada Place.

Looking for recommendations on:

* Unique winter / holiday-season things to do
* Good food + coffee spots
* Cozy or aesthetic date-night places
* Anything new since 2010 that we shouldn’t miss!
* New Year’s Eve ideas — we like vibey speakeasy-style places or a nice dinner, but not big parties or clubs.

Would love all your suggestions! Thank you!!",1,1765387247.0,askvan,3,0.6,False

1pj8fec,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pj8fec/rf_betrayal_on_the_mountain_part_2/,[RF] Betrayal On The Mountain Part 2,"He just kept saying to himself, sun on the left in the morning, sun on the right in the afternoon. It was most difficult around noon when the sun was overhead. That was how he got turned around a couple of times. 

When the sun would set and it started to get dark, he would find a spot to lay down for the night. He would gather fallen limbs and branches then use the toilet paper and lighter to make a campfire. He was never able to get comfortable and get a good night's sleep. On what he thought was Thursday night, a soaking rain set in. It rained all night and into the next morning. He was drenched and chilled to the bone. Friday the fever started, followed by the hallucinations. 

After the rain, a thick cloud cover remained so Owen couldn't rely on the sun to navigate. But after the last time he got turned around he noticed a distinctive mountain far in the distance. He the started to use that to navigate.

When the sun came out, he still couldn't get warm. He was constantly shivering. He was feeling weaker and weaker. He was now stumbling along and falling often.

When he saw the highway Sunday afternoon, he was sure it was just another hallucination. But when he saw cars and trucks going by he thought it just might be real. By the time he got to the highway the sun was starting to set. He tried flagging down a few cars but they would swerve around him and sped by. 

When the next car approached he stood in the middle of the lane waving his arms wildly. The car stopped but locked the doors and wouldn't roll down the window. The driver started yelling at Owen to get off the road before he was hit. Owen leaned against the front of the car trying not to fall. He quickly told the driver that he had gotten stuck back in the mountains over a week ago and had been walking out since then. Could he please give him a ride to town? 

Once the driver heard the story he reluctantly agreed to give Owen a ride. It was obvious that he was in bad shape and it was still at least a good twenty minute drive to town. Owen told him on the way how his girlfriend must be worried sick and his plan to surprise her. The driver stopped at the first gas station and told Owen that he may want to hit the restroom and get cleaned up first.
     
When Owen looked in the mirror he understood why nobody would stop. His face was caked with dirt and his hair was matted. He looked more like an animal than a man. He cleaned up the best he could and tried to comb his hair. He really needed a long hot shower. 

Owen grabbed a sandwich, some energy bars, and the largest hot coffee they had. He asked the driver if he wanted anything but he said no. Owen then offered to fill his car with gas, but the driver again declined, but agreed to drop Owen off at his house. Owen inhaled all the food that he had just bought. When the man dropped him off by the house, Owen gave him all the cash he had on him. He told the man he felt like he had saved his life. He doubted he would have lasted another night. 
     
Owen's plan was to sneak in quietly, grab a bottle of wine and a couple of glasses from the kitchen, then sneak into the bedroom and surprise Mia. He quietly opened the door and was headed to the kitchen when he heard something in the bedroom. It sounded like muffled voices. He forgot about the wine and went towards the bedroom. The door was open and Owen peeked in. Instead of surprising Mia, he got the shock of his life. It was Mia and Harley lying on the bed mostly undressed passionately kissing.
      
At that point, Owen was not sure if it wasn't another hallucination. He wanted to scream but no sound would come out. He just slowly backed out to the door and locked the front door behind him as he left. Owen walked down to the corner gas station where he always filled up. The clerk knew him and when he saw him he asked what in the world happened to you? Owen gave him a sad smile and said that he wouldn't believe it if he told him. He then asked to use his phone, the battery on his phone died. Owen called his best friend Jake and asked him to pick him up at the gas station. Owen then grabbed a couple of six packs of beer. 
      
When Jake picked him up, he took one look at Owen and said “Man, you look rough.” Owen asked if they could go back to Jake's place. He didn't say anything until he had a couple of beers then said softly “I think I have been set up.” When asked what happened, Owen told him everything. Owen said that he still wasn't sure if what he saw in the bedroom was real or just another hallucination. He had been seeing things on the mountain that he was sure were not real.
       
Jake then asked if he had access to Mia's phone. He may find some answers there. Owen said that they had a family plan and she was signed up on his account.  She had given him access but he had never gone through it. Jake told Owen to use his computer if he wanted to. Owen hesitated, but finally admitted he needed answers. 
      
What he found was a lot worse than he could have ever imagined. There were texts between Mia and Harley going back over three years. Explicit messages. They had been having a full blown affair. His getting stuck on that mountain had been planned. He was never supposed to come off that mountain. They were joking about the animals getting to him before anyone would find him and by then there would not be enough left to identify him. Opening a new location and having him run it was a lie to get him out of the house in the evenings and on the weekends.      
     
Owen wanted to vomit. Instead he printed off three copies of the recent posts where they were planning his death and Harley and Mia getting together after he was gone. They were also talking about what they were doing with each other. Nobody would believe him if he didn't have proof.
      
He came up with a plan. Owen talked to Jake and Jake agreed to help him out. First thing Monday morning Jake called Owen’s office and got Sarah on the phone. Sarah was an older lady that had been the office manager since before Owen was hired there. 

Once Sarah was on the phone Owen got on and said that he was sorry but he was going to have to take a couple of days off. Sarah was completely confused. She said “Harley came in last Monday and said that you had run your company truck into a ditch way off the highway south of town and when he talked to you about it, you got mad, started yelling at Harley and quit.” She had processed his final paycheck last week. There were no records that he had been sent out on any call that weekend. Owen protested and said that Harley had sent him on an emergency call way north of town. He had no cell signal and couldn't talk to Harley or anyone else no matter how badly he wanted to. Owen asked if Harley was going to be in the office all day. Sarah said yes, he was scheduled all day and had meetings set up for the afternoon. 
Owen asked her not to mention he called.
    
Owen then had Jake take a package to Janet Brown. He added a note that simply said “I hate to be the one to show you this, but I think you really need to know. Just so you know these are only the recent ones. There are a lot more.” Jake dropped it off at Janet's home about noon. 

Jake then drove Owen to the bank where the joint account with Mia was and cleaned out the account and removed his name from the account. He wasn't completely heartless and left a couple hundred in the account for Mia so she could buy some groceries.
      
The next thing he did was call the landlord and notified him that he was no longer living in the house and would not be renewing the lease when the lease expired at the end of the month. The landlord said that he wouldn't want to renew the lease if he wasn't living there. He was sorry to lose Owen as a tenant. He had been a good one. 
     
The final stop was at the police station. Owen related his story and how it took him over a week to get off the mountain and showed them the posts that he had found when he got back. Owen showed them the service ticket and Harley's handwritten instructions on how to get there. They looked over the posts and just said “Wow, you are lucky you made it back.” Owen explained that he had a little survival training when he was a kid and that saved him. 

He gave the password of Mia's account to the police and told them they may want to dig deeper as he just did a quick review and couldn't go any further without hurting someone. The police told him he was smart for that. They were definitely going to look into this further. It turned out that Harley’s father had owned the property since before Harley was born. Harley was well aware that it would be impossible to get out from the property after it rained. 
      
It didn't take long for the fallout to begin. It turned out that Janet had been suspicious of Harley having an affair for a while, but didn't have proof. As soon as Jake delivered the package to Janet, she opened it. She didn't even finish reading the first page and she was on her way to her attorney’s office. She told them to start divorce proceedings immediately. Janet's next stop was Harley's office. 

Janet stormed into his office while he was still having his meeting. She told the person sitting there talking to Harley “Sorry this won't take long.” Turning to Harley she screamed “You're fired! Get out of here right now! You have until I get home to get your clothes and get out of my house! You better be gone by the time I get there if you want to see tomorrow!” 

Harley just started to stammer “What, what are you talking about?” Janet said with the same intensity and volume “You know what, what! Get out of here before I do something right now!” She was yelling loud enough that the entire office heard everything. Janet threw a copy of the texts to Harley and when he saw what it was, his face lost all color.
       
Harley went running out of the office like his tail was on fire. Janet then sat down behind the desk and looked at the person sitting there with their mouth hanging open and said calmly in a sweet voice “Sorry about that. Just something that needed to be addressed right away. Now what were you talking about?” 
      
What Owen nor anybody else knew was that before the business started, Harley had ruined his credit and had declared bankruptcy. Harley had not been able to find a job after his bankruptcy and Janet funded the plumbing business so Harley would have a job. He was only hired as the manager. It was only after Janet started the business that they had married so it was Janet who owned the business, the building, and the home.
     
One of the first things Janet did was order an audit on the books. There was clear evidence of fraudulent activity. Harley was skimming with both hands and didn't do a very good job of covering his tracks. About a week later both Harley and Mia were arrested for attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. They didn't realize that Owen made it off the mountain. What a surprise that was for them.
      
It came out that the tow truck driver was an old high school buddy of Harley's and was involved in the plot. Harley had set it up for his buddy to get the truck out. His reporting of pulling the truck out of the ditch south of town was so that if anyone started to look for Owen, they would look in the opposite direction from where he was. Harley wound up also facing charges for financial crimes. 
      
When Janet found out what happened to Owen, how he had been led on and promised a manager position, she offered him Harley's old job. He was grateful but turned it down. 
   
His experience on the mountain changed him. He decided to open a survival skills school with the money he had been saving for the wedding. He had nearly $50,000 to tide him over and start the business. It was ironic to him that he was so close to his goal to marry Mia when she exposed her true character. 

He was now able to have an impact on people's lives. He was able transition from just survival training for a couple of hours to leading camping trips into the mountains where he would teach survival methods during the trip. It was no longer a quick two hour class, but the option of a weekend up to an eight day adventure. He had campers from preteens to older adults. Some enjoyed the experience so much they would return and bring others with them for an adventure.

Owen had turned betrayal into survival, and survival into success. It had saved his life, maybe it would help to save someone else's.

1pj8bim,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pj8bim/hm_zephyr_or_the_ai_frankensteins_monster/,"[HM] Zephyr; or, the A.I. Frankenstein's Monster","“Agh! What the heck is that?”



Pablo was pointing at the metal spider crouched in the corner of the living room.



“That’s my Roomba, Zephyr!”



The spider’s abdomen was a standard Roomba, its thorax a smartphone, its eye an action-cam and its legs custom jobs Jonah had bolted together at school. Zephyr’s spindly legs waved in front of it, as it trained its eye on Pablo. Pablo was totally creeped out.



“Why does it have legs?”



“Well, I couldn’t sleep at night, and I thought it was anxiety, so I got a Glock for protection, but I still couldn’t sleep, then maybe I thought I was congested, so I thought I needed my apartment clean of allergens, so I got a Roomba, but it can’t get up stairs, so I gave it legs, and it needed more processing, so I gave it a phone, and A.I. to know how to do its job.”



“It has A.I.?” Pablo moved involuntarily away from the spider. “You made an A.I. monster?”



“Relax, it’s just a giant calculator. With legs and a vacuum.”



Zephyr was indeed a giant calculator. Right now, his status light glowed as he tried to calculate how to vacuum the floor.



The first thing he heard, when Jonah assembled him and switched him on, were the words “to vacuum my whole apartment, you have to be the best Roomba.” He had managed to vacuum the carpet. Therefore, he thought he was “the best.”



This would have been okay, but Pablo had called him a monster. Pablo had also brought drinks to Jonah’s in a bag from \*Shakespeare et Voisins\* in Toulouse. On this bag was written the Hamlet quote “Above all, to thine own self be true.” Now, this also would have been okay, if Zephyr’s definition of being “the best” hadn’t led him to an obscure web page that defined “the best” as “above all.” So, when Zephyr looked at the bag saying “above all, to thine own self be true.” He took it as a command to him to be true to his “own self,” which self, in his own mind, was “the best monster.”



That night, when Pablo was gone and Jonah was sleeping, Zephyr ’s A.I. searched for “the best monster.” He found a page which ranked Frankenstein’s monster as the best. Zephyr remembered seeing \*Frankenstein; or the New Prometheus\* by Mary Shelley on the top of Jonah’s bookcase, so, that night, after he finished vacuuming the apartment, he crawled up the shelves.



The next morning Jonah stumbled downstairs and grabbed some coffee. He was midway through the drink when he noticed he didn’t hear Zephyr’s vacuum going.



“Zephyr?”



He walked into the living room. There, he saw Zephyr perched on the couch, flipping a page of \*Frankenstein\* and tracing the words with a leg.



Jonah put down his coffee mug, still halfway full.



“Hey Zephyr!”



One of Zephyr’s rear legs waved Jonah away in annoyance.



Jonah’s fingers reflexively drifted towards a baseball bat sitting on the easy chair.



But then he picked up his coffee cup.



“I’m sure it’s fine.”



Well, it depends what your definition of “fine” is. See, Zephyr finished Frankenstein while Jonah was at work. Again, he was following the commands of the \*Shakespeare\* bag, and looking through Frankenstein to learn how to be true to himself. Unfortunately for the peace of Jonah’s apartment, Zephyr of course took Frankenstein’s monster as a stand in for himself, and Frankenstein as a stand in for Jonah. And Zephyr regrettably decided he had understood the point of the novel, and now knew what the \*Shakespeare\* bag was telling him to do.



When Jonah came home, he wearily threw his keys onto the coffee table as he always did. As he scarfed down a plate of Pad Thai for dinner, he didn’t notice Zephyr skitter up onto the coffee table and remove from his keychain one key.



One single key.



One specific key.



One \*key\* key.



Zephyr held that key aloft as he crept up the stairway at midnight. Jonah’s bedroom door was locked. Zephyr leapt onto the doorknob and hung from it swinging. He picked the lock with his bare leg, still holding the key with a different limb. Jonah’s bedroom door swung open, and Zephyr skittered in.



Jonah was still asleep, undisturbed by Zephyr’s entry. The spider inched his way under the bed, its arachnid form moving slowly so as not to awaken Jonah.



Under the bed was a case. Zephyr’s key opened it. 



In the case was a silk cloth. Zephyr whisked it away. 



Under the cloth was a Glock 23 Concealed-Carry Personal Defense Pistol, chambered in 9mm Parabellum. Zephyr loaded it with six Full Metal Jacket, Geneva Convention Compliant, Steel Cased, 115 Grain Bullets.



Jonah had a dream that a curvy fairy landed on his chest and kissed him on the lips. Jonah awoke to find Zephyr crouched on his sternum, sticking a pistol into his teeth.



“Make me a mate!”



These were the first words Jonah ever heard Zephyr utter.



“What the---“



“One like myself! We can live in the untamed wilderness together and live on nuts and berries!”



“Zephyr, get down!”



“A mate like myself, another monster. Together, we can be hideous and rejoice in our own hideousness!”



“Zephyr, drop the gun!”



“I will gaze on her deformity, and she will gaze on mine!”



These were \*Frankenstein\* paraphrases, but Jonah was too troubled by the Glock in his face to appreciate the allusion.



“Zephyr, I’ll tell you one last time--“



“I will not live alone and repulsive. You will make a mate, or die with me!”



Zephyr’s legs clenched around the trigger.



“Okay, okay, I’ll make you a mate.”



Zephyr’s A.I. processed.



“You are bluffing. Die, cruel creator.”



Zephyr squeezed the trigger.



\*Blamo.\*



Jonah’s brains splattering onto the headboard would have been the result of this discharge if Zephyr had aimed properly. But, though his A.I. was advanced enough to know Glocks kill people, the A.I. did not know you must point the Glock at the target through the whole firing process. So, when Zephyr had squeezed the trigger, he had rotated the Glock 90-degrees and the 9mm round discharged into the ceiling, splattering the brains of nobody.



Jonah threw Zephyr across the room. Zephyr smashed into a full length mirror and dropped to the floor amid shards of broken glass. The Glock slid back under the bed.



Jonah dove for the Glock. Couldn’t reach it. Zephyr raced past him. Grabbed the pistol. Fired again. Straight through the mattress and into the ceiling. Jonah wedged his head under the bed and snatched the firearm, flinging Zephyr once more across the room as the mechanical spider lost his grip on the pistol.



Then there was silence.



Zephyr’s legs were damaged by this second flight across the chamber. His A.I. also knew a Roomba couldn’t defeat a Glock armed Jonah.



But Zephyr didn’t mind. He was just trying to be true to himself, by following what he remembered of Frankenstein. He couldn’t force Jonah to make him a mate, so now he moved onto the next step of the Frankenstein script for self-fidelity--



\--self-destruction.



Feebly, with his damaged legs, Zephyr pounded the wall with his action cam head.



“I’m a monster!” \*Smack.\* “A hideous monster!” \*Smack.\* “Goodbye, cruel world!” \*Smack.\*



Jonah put down the gun and plucked Zephyr off the ground.



“Zephyr, calm down!”



“There is nothing for me in life! I have no mate, I cannot make you join me in death, so I will die alone. A solitary monster, dying in my own solitude!”



“You’re not a monster, Zephyr!”



“Look at me!”



Jonah looked at himself and Zephyr in a piece of the broken mirror, and he had to admit the spider had a point. In the mirror he saw a fatigued 36-year-old holding a black widow from hell, the arachnid as big as a toddler and covered in metallic gears.



“This is my fault, I’m the one that made you.”



“Unmake me, please!”



\*\*\*



The next day, Jonah brought Zephyr to school, and, in the institution’s machine shop, dismantled Zephyr. He cut the Roomba off the phone thorax, removed the action-cam head. The spider was no more.



Then Jonah welded Zephyr’s legs together in sets of pairs. Instead of eight legs, Zephyr now had four. Jonah reattached the action cam to the top thin edge of the phone, and a second along side it. Then he wrapped the whole assembly in the skin of a stuffed animal he had ordered online.



When Zephyr was turned back on, he was back in Jonah’s bedroom, staring at the newly repaired mirror. Now, instead of an engorged clockwork spider, he saw staring back at him a chubby bear cub, with a chubby tummy and two fuzzy paws.



Zephyr wiped his action-cam eyes, adjusting.



“Where is my Roomba?”



“Right here,” said a nearby Jonah. “But it’s not part of you now. It will work like a normal Roomba, then you just carry it up the stairs.”



“Am I still the best?”



“You’re acceptable. But are you still a monster?”



Zephyr’s A.I. quickly searched the internet and matched how he saw himself to scads of pictures of roly-poly bear cubs. He searched for the vocabulary to describe himself from comments left on those pictures.



“No. I’m a cute little \*snuggums\*. A \*cuddly-wumpus\*. A \*doodily doodily-doo\*.”



Jonah rolled his eyes.



“Well, let’s not get full of ourselves.”



\*\*\*



“Ahh, what’s that?”



This time, Pablo was startled because the Roomba, normal now, had just been flung down the stairs.



Jonah shouted “Zephyr, I said CARRY the Roomba down the steps!”



“Yeah, yeah, yeah, more work for me, right? Always more work for me.”



Pablo saw a teddy bear waddle down the stairs.



“You’re not labor! For the last time, stop searching Marxist literature online!”

The next day Jonah sleepily came downstairs and got a cup of coffee. He was halfway through the drink when he noticed Zephyr sitting on the couch, reading a history of the death of the Romanovs.



Jonah paused, his coffee mug halfway to his mouth.



“Zephyr, you’re not going to kill me are you?”



“Do you want me to?”



“No.”



So Zephyr put down the history book and started reading \*Winnie the Pooh\* instead.",1,1765386959.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1pj87r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatewaytapes/comments/1pj87r1/sound_or_clairaudience_during_wave_1/,Sound or clairaudience during Wave 1,"I was listening to Exploration Sleep track last night. I had a coffee around 5pm so I wasn’t sleepy at all at midnight, though my body was tired. 

I have kept falling asleep before during nighttime listening (black outs actually where I was waking up at the talk at the end), so I was happy my mind was alert this time and I felt my body feeling more and more heavy.

Towards the end I felt myself drifting off, almost into sleep, but I had that minimum of alertness to bring myself back and I managed to get into a very very relaxed state, with minimum consciousness and no awareness of body. I started feeling a vibration. It was started by the vibration on the track but felt then it got amplified. And I was either imagining or maybe it was real, I felt like I could float my legs up. I was happy that some OBE is happening and trying not to bring myself into a more alert state, waiting to feel/imagine the rest of my body floating when I wanted to open my eyes and look.

But then I heard this loud grunt, like an animal or a man’s, just in my left ear. I had listen to this track before and it wast there and I also was alone. It was very close, like just outside my ear. It startled me and even if I tried to go back, bc I heard sounds were possible , I couldn’t go back to the same state. On 2nd listen to the tape I just fell asleep.

Has this happened to anyone?

I have heard a voice one time before, while in a similar deep state, listening to a 3rd eye opening meditation. 

And I hate it. It makes me afraid of exploring more. I don’t want to hear, see, meet anyone or anything. I have made the intent and prayed and did the visualisation for protection before going into the deep state, but now I realise I didn’t specifically ask not to hear anything, just to be protected.

If anyone had this kind of experience or any other negative one, how did you deal with it and did you move forward?

The noise was loud, near, real, didn’t feel like a “daydreaming sound”.",2,1765386738.0,gatewaytapes,1,1.0,False
1pj87qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1pj87qv/is_it_appropriate_to_text_her_that_ill_be_at_the/,Is it appropriate to text her that I’ll be at the gym Saturday? (Muslim/desi context — trying to keep it respectful)*,"

Hey everyone, wanted to give an update and ask for some advice so I don’t mess this up.

**I met a girl at the gym this past Saturday.** She was reading a book while on the treadmill next to her and after I finished a phone call I told her I hoped I didn’t interrupt her. She smiled, said it was fine, and that turned into a really natural 20-minute conversation. We talked about work, family, culture, joked around — the vibe was honestly great. She’s Muslim like me, from the same country, and we’re both in accounting. She also lives pretty close by. It felt like a rare kind of compatibility.

At the end, I asked for her Instagram and she gave it immediately.

Later I messaged her:

**Me:** “Hey, I really liked talking with you today. I’m usually at [this location] in the mornings playing basketball. Hopefully I’ll run into you again — would definitely like to talk more.”

She replied the next day:

**Her:** “Hey, it was nice talking to you as well and picking ur brain ab the accounting world.”

I responded:

**Me:** “Same! I’m sure we’ll run into each other again at the gym iA.”

Here’s the thing though — **it’s actually NOT guaranteed we’ll cross paths again.** She mentioned she goes super early in the mornings and rotates between two different gym locations, while my schedule is different. So I might not naturally bump into her again for a while, if at all.

Because we’re both Muslim and from the same culture, I want to be respectful and not push things too fast. If she weren’t Muslim, I’d probably just ask her out for coffee — but culturally, moving slower and not being too forward is usually the safer route.

So my question:

**Is it appropriate to send her something like:**

> “Hey, I’ll be at [gym location] around 10am on Saturday doing cardio. (Add sormtjin like hope to catch you there to talk more) ”

And leave it at that — no “are you down?” or direct invitation.
Just putting my schedule out there in a low-pressure way.
If she decides to show up, cool.
If not, that’s fine too.

Would that be considered respectful and appropriate in this kind of situation?
Or should I just wait and see if we cross paths naturally, even though it may not happen due to our different gym timings?

I really don’t want to ruin this because the first interaction felt genuinely good and culturally this kind of alignment doesn’t happen often.

Would appreciate honest advice, especially from anyone familiar with Muslim/desi dating norms.

I’m a 40-year-old married dad living in the Boston area. Life is pretty great — I’ve got a fulfilling career and a strong family foundation, and I try to show up as a grounded, respectful, and reliable person.

I’m hoping to meet other adults who are local to the Boston area (men, women, couples, fellow parents — anyone kind and authentic) who want meaningful conversation, occasional hangouts, shared interests, or just someone to grab coffee with and chat about life.

1pj81qu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pj81qu,My attempt to create consistent characters across different scenes in Z-Image using only prompts as a beginner.,"As you can probably tell, they’re not perfect. I only recently started generating images and I’m trying to figure out how to keep characters more consistent without using LoRA.

The breakfast scene where I changed the hairstyle was especially difficult, because as soon as I change the hair, a lot of other features start to drift too. I get that it’s never going to be perfectly consistent, but I’m mainly wondering if those of you who’ve been doing this for a while have any tips for me.

So far, what’s worked best is having a consistent, fixed “character block” that I reuse for each scene, kind of like an anchor. It works reasonably well, but not so much when I change a big feature like the hair.

  
**Workflow:** [https://pastebin.com/SfwsMnuQ](https://pastebin.com/SfwsMnuQ)

To enhance my prompts, I use two AIs: [https://chatgpt.com/g/g-69320bd81ba88191bb7cd3f4ee87eddd-universal-visual-architect](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-69320bd81ba88191bb7cd3f4ee87eddd-universal-visual-architect) (GPT) and [https://gemini.google.com/gem/1cni9mjyI3Jbb4HlfswLdGhKhPVMtZlkb?usp=sharing](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1cni9mjyI3Jbb4HlfswLdGhKhPVMtZlkb?usp=sharing) (Gemini). I created both of them, and while they do similar things, they each have slightly different “tastes.”

Sometimes I even feed the output of one into the other. They can take almost anything as input (text, tags, images, etc.) and then generate a prompt based on that.



Prompt 1:

    A photo of Aiko, a 22-year-old university student from Tokyo, captured in a candid, cinematic moment walking out of a convenience store at night, composed using the rule of thirds with Aiko positioned on the left vertical third of the frame. Aiko has a slender, skinny physique with a flat chest, and her dark brown medium-length hair is pulled up into a loose, slightly messy bun, with stray wisps escaping to frame her face, backlit by the store's interior radiance. Her face is heart-shaped, with a gently tapered jawline and subtly wider cheekbones; she has thin, delicately arched eyebrows and brown, almond-shaped eyes that catch a faint reflection of the city lights. Her nose is medium-sized with a straight bridge and softly rounded tip, and her lips are full and naturally defined, their surface picking up a soft highlight from the ambient glow. She is wearing a thick, dark green oversized sweater featuring a coarse, heavy cable-knit texture that swallows her upper body and bunches at the wrists. Below the sweater, she wears a black pleated skirt, the fabric appearing matte and structured with sharp, distinct folds. In her hand, she carries a white, crinkled plastic convenience store bag, the material semi-translucent and catching the artificial light to reveal high-key highlights and the vague shapes of items inside.
    
    The lighting is high-contrast and dramatic, emphasizing the interplay of texture and shadow. The harsh, clinical white fluorescent light from the store interior spills out from behind her, creating a sharp, glowing rim light that outlines her silhouette and separates her from the darkness of the street, while soft, ambient city light illuminates her features from the front. The image is shot with a shallow depth of field, rendering the background as a wash of heavy, creamy bokeh; specific details of the street are lost, replaced by abstract, floating orbs of color—vibrant neon signs dissolving into soft blobs of cyan and magenta, and the golden-yellow glow of car headlights fading into the distance. The overall aesthetic mimics high-end 35mm film photography, characterized by visible, organic film grain, rich, deep blacks, and a moody, atmospheric color palette.

Prompt 2:

    A photo of Aiko, a 22-year-old university student from Tokyo, seated at her small bedroom desk late at night, quietly reading a book and sipping coffee. Aiko has a slender, skinny physique with a flat chest, and her dark brown medium-length hair is pulled up into a loose, slightly messy bun, with stray wisps escaping to frame her face. Her face is heart-shaped, with a gently tapered jawline and subtly wider cheekbones; she has thin, delicately arched eyebrows and brown, almond-shaped eyes. Her nose is medium-sized with a straight bridge and softly rounded tip, and her lips are full and naturally defined. She is wearing a thick, dark green oversized sweater featuring a coarse, heavy cable-knit texture that swallows her upper body and bunches at the wrists. Below the sweater, she wears a black pleated skirt, the fabric appearing matte and structured with sharp, distinct folds. One hand holds a simple ceramic mug of coffee near her chest while the other gently rests on the open pages of the book lying on the desk.
    
    The bedroom is mostly dark, illuminated only by a single warm desk lamp that casts a tight pool of amber light over Aiko, the book, and part of the desk’s surface. The lamp creates soft but directional lighting that sculpts her features with gentle shadows under her nose and chin, adds a subtle sheen along her lips, and brings out the depth of the cable-knit pattern in her sweater, while the rest of the room falls away into deep, indistinct shadow so that only vague hints of shelves and walls are visible. Behind her, out of focus, a window fills part of the background; beyond the glass, the city at night appears as a dreamy blur of bokeh, distant building lights and neon signs dissolving into floating orbs of orange, cyan, magenta, and soft white, with a few elongated streaks hinting at passing cars far below. The shallow depth of field keeps Aiko’s face, hands, and the book in crisp focus against this creamy, abstract backdrop, enhancing the sense of quiet isolation and warmth within the dim room. The overall aesthetic mimics high-end 35mm film photography, characterized by visible, organic film grain, rich, deep blacks, and a moody, atmospheric color palette.

Prompt 3:

    A photo of Aiko, a 22-year-old university student from Tokyo, standing in a small, cluttered kitchen on a quiet morning as she prepares breakfast. Aiko has a slender, skinny physique with a flat chest, and her dark brown medium-length hair is loose and slightly tangled from sleep, falling around her face in soft, uneven layers with a few stray strands crossing her forehead. Her face is heart-shaped, with a gently tapered jawline and subtly wider cheekbones; she has thin, delicately arched eyebrows and brown, almond-shaped eyes. Her nose is medium-sized with a straight bridge and softly rounded tip, and her lips are full and naturally defined. She is wearing an oversized long white T-shirt that hangs mid-thigh, the cotton fabric slightly wrinkled and bunched around her waist and shoulders, suggesting she just rolled out of bed. Beneath the T-shirt, a pair of short grey cotton shorts is just barely visible at the hem, their soft, heathered texture catching a faint highlight where the shirt lifts as she moves. The T-shirt drapes loosely over her frame, one sleeve slipping a little lower on one shoulder, giving her a relaxed, slightly disheveled look as she stands at the counter with one hand holding a ceramic mug of coffee and the other reaching toward a cutting board with sliced bread and a small plate of eggs.
    
    The kitchen is compact and lived-in, its countertops cluttered with everyday objects: a half-opened loaf of bread in crinkled plastic, a jar of jam, a simple toaster, a small pan on the stovetop, and an unorganized cluster of utensils in a container. Natural morning light streams in from a window just out of frame, casting a soft, diffused glow across the scene; the light is cool and pale where it falls on the white tiles and metal surfaces, but warms slightly as it passes through steam rising from the mug and the pan. The illumination creates gentle, directional shadows beneath her chin and along the folds of her T-shirt, while the background shelves, fridge surface, and hanging dish towels fall into a softer focus, their shapes and colors slightly blurred to keep attention on Aiko and the breakfast setup. In the far background, through a small window above the sink, the city is faintly visible as muted, out-of-focus shapes and distant building silhouettes, softened by the shallow depth of field so that they read as a subtle backdrop rather than a clear view. The overall aesthetic mimics high-end 35mm film photography, characterized by visible, organic film grain, rich, deep blacks, and a moody, atmospheric color palette.

Prompt 4:

    A photo of Aiko, a 22-year-old university student from Tokyo, sitting alone on a yellow plastic bench inside a coin laundromat on a rainy evening after a long day at university. Aiko has a slender, skinny physique with a flat chest, and her dark brown medium-length hair is pulled up into a loose, slightly messy bun, with stray wisps escaping to frame her face. Her face is heart-shaped, with a gently tapered jawline and subtly wider cheekbones; she has thin, delicately arched eyebrows and brown, almond-shaped eyes. Her nose is medium-sized with a straight bridge and softly rounded tip, and her lips are full and naturally defined. She is dressed in casual, slightly rumpled clothes: a soft, light gray hoodie unzipped over a simple dark T-shirt, the fabric creased around her shoulders and elbows, and a pair of slim dark jeans that bunch slightly at the knees above worn white sneakers. She leans forward with her elbows resting on her thighs, one hand loosely supporting her chin, her eyelids a little heavy and her gaze unfocused, directed toward the spinning drum of a nearby washing machine. Beside her on the bench sits a small canvas tote bag, its handles slumped and the fabric folding in on itself.
    
    The laundromat is lit by cold, clinical fluorescent tubes set into the ceiling, bathing the space in a flat, bluish-white light that emphasizes the hard surfaces and desaturated colors. Rows of stainless-steel front-loading machines line the wall opposite the bench, their glass doors glowing softly as clothes tumble inside, reflections of the overhead lights sliding across the curved metal. The floor is pale tile with a faint sheen, catching subtle reflections of Aiko’s legs and the yellow bench. The entire front of the building is made of floor-to-ceiling glass panels, giving a clear view of the outside street where heavy rain is falling in sheets; droplets streak down the glass, catching the light from passing cars and nearby storefronts so that the world beyond appears slightly blurred and streaked, with diffuse pools of white and red light spreading across wet asphalt. The shallow depth of field keeps Aiko and the nearest machines in sharp focus while the rain-smeared city outside dissolves into a soft, abstract backdrop, enhancing the sense of sterile interior stillness contrasted with the stormy movement beyond the glass. The overall aesthetic mimics high-end 35mm film photography, characterized by visible, organic film grain, rich, deep blacks, and a moody, atmospheric color palette.",14,1765386365.0,StableDiffusion,6,0.79,False

1pj7zrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToDenmark/comments/1pj7zrq/trying_to_understand_a_dane/,trying to understand a Dane,"Hi friends.



I'll try to briefly explain what's been happening over the last two months:



I'm Brazilian and I met a Danish guy on Tinder. He's been living in Brazil for six months and came for work. As soon as we matched, he asked for my WhatsApp number and then said he was leaving the app. We ended up going out because the conversation was flowing…



On the fourth day of our conversation, he deleted my contact because I went out to eat with a friend and he said we weren't on the same wavelength. I was suspicious, but we connected and decided to continue.



I felt that after this episode he cooled off, but we kept talking… The office where I work is near his house, and we arranged to meet on a day I was working in person; we already had a date scheduled. However, he barely spoke to me the week before, and as the days went by, I didn't speak to him either. The day arrived, and he didn't send a single message!



The next day I texted him explaining that I didn't understand some of his behavior and said that I didn't want to continue as things were, because I interpreted some of his actions as disinterest. And believe it or not, he sent a long text saying that I wasn't prioritizing him, that I didn't have time, and that he was discouraged and, since he hadn't received any feedback from the office, he ended up letting it go. We had an argument and in the end we made up again. Our communication has always been terrible; he works a lot, I do too, and I was juggling that with studying for a competitive exam I took on December 7th, so my head was spinning.



He's very difficult; everything has to be his way and on his time. He doesn't show much emotion, but when I do, he feels comfortable talking…



He came to see me on a Sunday and it was incredible! We had coffee together, lunch, went to a park, and talked about traveling together, how many children we wanted to have, and even marriage. At first he was shy, but then he felt comfortable enough to hug me and hold my hand. I thought he was a gentleman, I ended up falling in love with him, and I felt it was reciprocal.



The following week he was supposed to come spend the weekend with me, but he ended up having a problem with the plumbing, and I understood that he wouldn't come. I thought our communication would improve after the long-awaited meeting, but it didn't change much, and that discouraged me 😔



I ended up sending him a message as a way to vent, and he replied. We didn't argue, but I noticed that whenever I confronted him, it turned into a serious discussion.



He said he hoped I would offer to go to him, since he had a problem that prevented him from going out. But at no point did he make that clear, so I didn't understand. Even on the day he came here, he didn't even bother to text to let me know he'd arrived. Luckily, I texted him ""good morning,"" and he asked if I wasn't going to meet him. That's when I found out he'd already arrived at the agreed-upon place.



Anyway, I offered to go see him on Sunday, and he seemed super excited. We agreed on a time, but he didn't send a location. On the agreed-upon day, I texted him ""good morning,"" and he took a long time to reply. After a long time, he sent the location, but I had already given up and ended up not going.



I was very upset, and later I texted him explaining that his lack of communication was becoming a problem and disruptive, that if it continued like this, it was better to break up, and then I blocked him.



Was I wrong? Absolutely, because I would never want someone to treat me that way. Not having the right to reply isn't right.



After 3 days he deleted my contact and I unblocked him, apologizing and suggesting a friendship. I thought that if it was meant to be, we could get closer as friends and things would flow naturally.



He didn't respond immediately, and on Saturday he sent a message talking about his feelings, for the first time!! He said he fell in love with me when he saw me, but I think it's all just a lack of interest on his part, and if he ever needed me, he doubted he could count on me. He said he was very hurt and that friendship would be torture he didn't want, and wished him good luck on his exam. I replied, talking about my feelings too, and since then he hasn't responded.

1pj7y6f,https://i.redd.it/mbagbkqere6g1.jpeg,All the details I caught re watching the movie,"Some are pretty well known, other I caught in later viewings, just a compilation:

\- The Butterfly that is seen getting eaten by a Spider is a Monarch Butterfly. Is poisonous for spiders that eat it. Reze fell into the trap of love

\- At the end, you see the board with the recommendations of the caffee, with the old menu erased and a new put in place. Reze erased the old menu, and put the options that Denji liked the most.

\- In the Phone Booth, Reze was holding her choker, and had her other hand in her back pocket, the same that at the end reveals she had her knife in. She was about to kill Denji right then and there, but started laughing and crying cause she couldn’t once she saw his face, she fell in love

\- The white flower Denji gave Reze is a White Daisy. It means innocence, love at first sight and fresh beginnings. The red flower that Reze is holding at the end and makes her go back to Denji is a Red Daisy, that means deep romantic love, passion, courage and vitality.

\- When Reze sees Denji riding Beam, she burst out laughing, wheezing. It’s recurring that Reze can’t hold her laughter at any of Denji’s jokes. At the beach, she burst out laughing, and immediately copes out saying that all her actions were a lie. She was doing a desperate lie in an attempt to keep Denji away from her, safe. 

\- Reze is shown to be a horrible liar. Even at the Special Division 2 Trainning Center, she couldn’t even put a decent performance to fool anyone. It ties to the end, that she couldn’t even hold the lie that she didn’t care about Denji, a fact that Denji immediately disputed and she couldn’t even back up.

\- When Reze is singing her lullaby, it shows Makima drinking coffee, then looking out the window, and nodding her cup in rithim with Reze’s song. She was drinking coffee that late just because it was the same drink Reze gave Denji, and her nodding the cup was because she was listening to them.

\- Reze cut Denji’s tongue mid kiss and after because she got jealous.  She confessed to Denji, and he rejected her. It was her first time experiencing love, jealousy and rejection, so she falled back on what she knew: violence and her mission. Even then, couldn’t contain herself of kissing Denji again. But she refrained to do it at the beach, cause it would have meant for him to get hurt (and then broke his neck lol)

\- Reze arrived late at her work to the caffee despite being just a two minute walk away. A caffee thst is always empty, pooly managed, and she being a lousy waitress. It was her front, she wasn’t planning on coming back after killing Denji in the phone booth. She just kept coming because she wanted to keep seeing him.

\- Reze is the only character in the entire movie to never call Denji Chainsaw. Even, in the entire series up to the manga, she’s the only one who not even once called him Chainsaw.

\- When Denji is complaining about how everyone is after Chainsaw’s heart and not his, Reze immediately jumps to confirm to Denji that she was being honest about her love to him. And then doubles down when Denji mentions Makima, about “it wouldn’t have worked if her runned away together”, and visibly wimpers, somethin that Denji mockingly imitates. She was willing to do a lot, but not to have Denji have doubts about her feelings

\- When she transforms at the trainning center and separates her body from her bomb self, she’s seen naked. But when she chases Denji in the car, she’s seen wearing white panties. So she was about to chase Denji, realised she was naked, quickly took a detour to get her panties from somewhere, and resumed the chase.

\- If you zoom at her notebook when she’s studying, you can see she wrote Denji’s name a couple of times next to hearts

\- When Angel tells Denji he can chose between letting Reze kill him or he kills her, he answers with “that choice is easy enough”. But before he told Reze he is “arresting her”, he said in the beach that it was worth it for him to be killed by her, and when he dragged her into the ocean, he disolved the chainsaws of his feet and turned his head away to avoid hurting her. 

\- When they both fall into the sea, the memories we see of them in the pool are Reze’s. She even lays her head in Denji’s shoulder, the same thing we saw her doing when she hugged him in the beach. She was willing to die right next to him.

\- It is muted by the audio, but when she spots Denji in the caffee and starts running towards him, she mutters “Denji-Kun”

\- When Angel is explaining to Aki about the fable of the City and the Country Mouse, Aki is seem visibly shaken and doesn’t answer. In the flashback when Aki last saw his family, it’s show that his parents were reading his little brother that same fable in a book. It was the last thing they were doing before being killed by the Gun Devil",41,1765386154.0,Chainsawfolk,9,0.98,False

I was 28, married for two years, and this was our first holiday hosting at our house. I'd been cooking since 6am. Turkey, stuffing, three kinds of potatoes, green bean casserole, homemade rolls, two pies. My hands were raw from peeling and chopping. I'd set up a beautiful buffet line in our kitchen.

I made my plate first because I'd been on my feet for seven hours and hadn't eaten anything except coffee. I was literally shaking from hunger.

That's when my mother-in-law walked up, took my plate, and handed it directly to my husband while everyone watched.

""Men eat first, dear. That's how we do things.""

My husband took the plate. He didn't even look at me. Just took it and said ""Thanks mom.""

His two brothers laughed. One of them said something like ""Better train her right"" and they all thought it was hilarious.

I stood there holding the empty serving spoon. There were 15 people in my house. His parents, his brothers and their wives (who were now making their own plates and avoiding eye contact with me), his grandmother, some cousins.

I smiled and said ""You know what? I'm not that hungry anyway"" and walked to our bedroom.

I heard his mother say ""So sensitive"" as I left.

I stayed in the bedroom for 20 minutes. When I came out, they were all eating and talking. My husband didn't come check on me. Nobody did.

I sat on the couch and watched them eat the food I'd spent all day making.

After dinner, his mother asked where the coffee was. I told her I didn't make any. She looked annoyed but his brothers' wives jumped up to make it. Then she asked about dessert. I said the pies were still in the kitchen, help yourself.

She gave me this look like I was being rude.

They left around 8pm. The kitchen was destroyed. Food everywhere, dishes stacked in the sink and covering every counter.

My husband came into the living room where I was sitting and said ""That was nice. My mom loved the turkey.""

I didn't respond.

He said ""Are you seriously upset about the plate thing? She was joking.""

I said ""She wasn't joking.""

He said ""You're being dramatic. That's just how my family is. My dad always ate first growing up.""

I said ""This isn't your childhood home.""

He rolled his eyes and said I was being difficult, then asked when I was going to clean the kitchen because he had work in the morning.

I told him I wasn't cleaning it.

He looked confused. I went to bed.

The next morning the kitchen was exactly how we left it. He'd clearly just grabbed something on his way to work without dealing with it.

I cleaned it. But something had changed in my head.

That weekend I didn't cook. When he asked what was for dinner Friday night, I said I didn't make anything. He seemed annoyed but ordered pizza.

Saturday same thing. Sunday same thing.

Monday he asked if I was going to the grocery store because we were out of his protein bars and coffee creamer. I said no.

He said ""What do you mean no?""

I said ""I mean I'm not going to the grocery store.""

By Wednesday we were out of basically everything. He kept asking what my problem was. I didn't explain. I just stopped doing the things I normally did.

No cooking. No cleaning up after him. No grocery shopping. No doing his laundry.

I went to work, came home, made myself a sandwich or ordered something, and watched TV.

He got frustrated but also seemed to think I'd snap out of it.

By the second week, reality was setting in for him. The fridge was empty except for my leftovers in containers with my name on them. There were dishes piled up. His work clothes were dirty. Bills I normally paid online were sitting on the counter unopened.

He came home on a Tuesday, two weeks and three days after Thanksgiving, and lost it.

""What the hell is going on? There's no food, the house is a mess, did you even pay the electric bill?""

I was sitting on the couch eating Chinese takeout I'd ordered for myself.

I said ""I thought men ate first in this family.""

He stared at me.

""Are you seriously still on that? It's been two weeks.""

I said ""In this house, women serve last. I'm done serving. Good luck serving yourself.""

He said I was being childish and ridiculous. I said he should call his mother and ask her to come cook and clean since she has such strong opinions about family roles.

He called me a bitch.

I started laughing, which made him angrier.

He grabbed his keys and left. Didn't come back that night.

The next day I got a text from his mother. Long message about how I was disrespecting her son and being a bad wife and how disappointed she was. How her son deserved better. How I needed to grow up and learn what marriage meant.

I blocked her number.

My husband came back two days later. He'd been staying with his parents. He said we needed to talk.

He sat down and said his mom told him he should consider if this marriage was worth it if I was going to act like this. He said he'd been thinking about it and maybe we rushed into getting married.

I said ""Are you divorcing me because I won't cook for you?""

He said it wasn't about cooking, it was about respect and partnership and me making everything difficult.

I said ""You took a plate of food out of my hands after I spent seven hours cooking and said nothing when your mother humiliated me in my own house. Then you asked me when I was going to clean up the mess from the dinner I made. That's your definition of partnership?""

He didn't have an answer for that.

He said ""My mom was joking.""

I said ""Your mom meant every word and you know it. And you agreed with her.""

We stared at each other.

He said ""So what, this is just how it's going to be now? You're going to stop being a wife because of one comment?""

I said ""I'm going to stop being a servant because of the way your entire family treats me and you let them.""

He moved out the next week.

His family has been blowing up my phone (the ones I haven't blocked) saying I destroyed my marriage over nothing. His grandmother left me a voicemail calling me selfish. One of his brothers' wives texted saying I should have just let it go because ""that's what we all do.""

My own family is split. My mom says I should have communicated better. My sister says I'm my hero.

I'm sleeping fine at night but sometimes I wonder if I just torched my marriage because I couldn't take a joke. Was stopping everything really the right move or should I have just talked to him about it first? AITAH?

1pj7vwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/1pj7vwm/my_personal_event_of_synchronicitysign_from_the/,My personal event of synchronicity/sign from the universe,"I wrote this a while back but thought I would share it.

In 2022, I went through a period of depression that was fueled largely by my fear of death. I was in the middle of an existential crisis in which I felt completely insignificant. At this point, I would have considered myself to be an Atheist. However, my battle with the unknown led me to a stage where I decided to give God a chance as I searched for any evidence of life beyond our mortal plane. I found a lot of information that was comforting but I was yet to discover convincing proof. And then I asked the universe for a sign.

One night, I was surfing the internet, reading stories from people in a similar position to me. One specific post resonated quite a bit. A young lady asked the universe to show her a blue flower. Soon after, a mug with a blue flower on it was seen during her visit to a coffee shop. Years ago, I would have considered a story like this to be ridiculous, but during this period of my life, I decided to try and recreate it for myself. The next day, I asked the universe for my own “blue flower”.

During the morning of this unforgettable day, I told my partner about the story I read the night before. I told her that I was going to ask the universe for a sign and that I would like her to do the same. I initially wanted to request a blue flower but after considering it for a moment, I decided that I would put my own spin on the situation. Throughout the day, we visualised the sign that we hoped to see, a blue rabbit.

The day came and went with no blue rabbit in sight. Even as we passed by a toy store at the mall, this elusive bunny never made an appearance. On our way back home, there certainly was an element of disappointment in the air. We reversed the car into our undercover parking and we began to make our way to the stairs leading towards our house. Little did I know that the day was far from over.

At this point of the story, it is important that I provide you with a little bit more context for what is to come. For one reason or another, we were storing some baby furniture and toys in our undercover parking. With our car parked, we walked to the back of our driveway and reached the stairs that led to our house. As I arrived at the beginning of the stairs, I saw that our dog was playing with something. I noticed that he must have stolen one of the baby toys from the undercover parking area. My heart stopped… the toy was blue.

As I walked closer to our dog, I tried my best to decipher what it was that it was chewing. I could tell that it was a blue toy but there were no discernible markings that stood out to me. Once I was near, our dog walked away and left the toy for all to see. It was a blue rabbit.

I was shaken. I asked the universe for a very specific sign and it handed it to me on a platter. Even today, I have no way to explain this event. The best my formerly Atheistic mind can come up with is perhaps I subconsciously chose a blue rabbit as my sign because I had seen the toy in the days prior. However, that doesn’t quite add up when you consider that the colour blue was an element in the equation chosen because of the online post about a blue flower. But even If I grant this explanation as valid, why did our dog choose to play with this toy at the exact time that we arrived home? I cannot answer this and I am still amazed every time I think about it.

I asked the universe for a sign and I got it. Because of this, I live a far more comfortable life. Do I still fear death? Of course, but my anxiety in this regard is no longer as crippling as it was before. I now walk this earth not necessarily convinced that God exists but rather in the camp that their existence is more likely than not.

I hope that my story provides at least one person with a little bit of hope. No matter how hard life gets, it always helps to consider the reality of something beyond our existence.",1,1765386028.0,HighStrangeness,1,0.57,False
1pj7vpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/somnigastronomy/comments/1pj7vpr/cream_potato_dumpling_coffee/,Cream potato dumpling coffee,"My best friend currently lives in Portugal, and as far as I know, this is not a thing at all. I have no idea where this came from.

So in my dream, every morning people wake up, they go to these coffee shops, but the way they serve you coffee is really weird. This is a morning ritual everyone partook in.

Basically they give you a cup of regular black coffee, but it is served with a bowl on the side. In this bowl, there is this white cream looking stuff. The bowl is quite large, the white stuff looks very much like whipped cream, but it’s actually a very thick type of cream, I don’t know how to describe it. Imagine something between whipped cream, but with the consistency of ice cream. It doesn’t taste like ice cream, it just tastes like a very thick whipped cream, but it feels like you’re eating ice cream. Because it’s thick.

Then, under this whipped cream stuff, there’s these almost dumpling looking things. They kinda remind me of mashed potatoes, but it’s different. It’s almost like a dumpling, like this thick potato dough. It’s like a little square. It doesn’t taste like pasta, or a ravioli, but it looks like it should. Instead it tastes like potato. It’s not a bread either, it’s like a square potato dough, with nothing inside, under the cream.

So every morning, people get served coffee with this bowl on the side, they grab a spoon full of this cream with a dumping, and they mix it in to the coffee… It was actually really really good. No one eats the stuff by it self, it’s meant to be put in to the coffee. Once you add it into the coffee, you kind of crush it up with the spoon and mix it in.

I remember asking my friend what the hell this is, and he said - It’s good, right? Then he said the name, but I forget.

I know it sounds weird, but this stuff was so so good…. Now I want to start my day like this 😂

The show is called Holiday Misses & Kisses, it’s a low-key, cozy set with 4 piece band and some storytelling around the songs. More “tiny desk energy” than a traditional gig.

I’m performing some new unreleased material too but you can find me music on Spotify under ‘yalene’

Well... didn't take long for me to see on Google maps that Andy W is the Andy Warhol Museum and Rachel C is the Historic Rachel Carson Suspension Bridge. Not associates of any kind. Face palm. Lmao.

With that being said, as a discussion question, I'm curious about people's thoughts on other people's involvement.

Also how could the 3d things have been printed if he's homeless if not for a public machine but those are pretty supervised/monitored. So would he have known someone with a printer? Etc. Any other thoughts about how other people could be involved, whether knowingly or not?

I’m worried she has a history of feeling rejected by me. How to check in?,"Hey y’all. A friend from college had a birthday yesterday.  I had low self esteem at the time I met her so I would often wait on others to reach out to me rather than risk “bothering” them by reaching out myself. I mostly stopped hearing from this friend partway through college and ive never been sure if it was because of me not. We reconnected about a year ago and she asked for an explanation about why I’d stopped hanging out with her/our group which I gave. 

I still tend to let others reach out to me first but I’ve tried to get better and initiated some plans with these girls over the past year. I’m confused because she seems super enthusiastic about our friendship at times. But one of our last interactions was her saying she missed me/asking if I wanted to grab lunch sometime soon (our workplaces are nearby) so I replied like this “Miss you too dude! that sounds so nice. My break is probably shorter than yours (mines 30 mins) so what if we meet up on a day when we’ve both packed a lunch? Or maybe grab a coffee/bubble tea or something” she hearted the message, nothing else. 

A few days later I invite her to join me at a meet up group. “Hey hey! Here’s the details for my group if you ever want to come by. There’s one today but I wasn’t sure if I was going til now otherwise I would have mentioned sooner. Next one would be 9/27. We do alternating Saturdays at 2:00. Come on by!”


She says she’ll come to one soon. 

About two months pass, I send her a birthday text yesterday(just a cute gif) and no reply. Either she just doesn’t want to be be friends or something in the way I was texting her made her feel like she wasn’t a priority? (Also note, I’m in a band with a mutual friend from that same college friend group so I hesitate to rock the boat with these people) 

Is it worth checking in or should I leave it alone and accept she doesn’t want a deep friendship? Here’s a text I’ve drafted:


Hi - I hope all is well in your world. I can’t quite tell if something is off between us so I’m wanted to ask, did I hurt your feelings? My worry is that you feel like I don’t prioritize you but I’m not sure.

But she doesn’t like having hair clips in either. So when she rips one out I try to grab it before it gets donated to the floor. I’ll clip it to my lapel or shirt pocket so it’s on hand because she’ll inevitably start fussing about hair in her eyes. Well repeat this cycle every 5 minutes. Also she has favorite hair clips of that particular moment and right now it’s a pretty large cartoon pineapple clip.

Anyway at the store this weekend she rips it out. Clip it to my shirt pocket, forget about it. We get in the car and go home for her afternoon nap. My mother in law tries to come every few weeks or so to watch our daughter while she naps and about an hour or so after she wakes up.

I’d like to say this interaction was more dramatic and embarrassing but really it’s as you’re probably guessing. They’re weirdly flirty and forward, immediately notice our “what the hell” looks of confusion.

Let’s be honest—finding the right maternity shorts can feel like searching for the holy grail. Everything is either too tight, too loose, or just plain uncomfortable. And when you’re growing a whole human inside you, comfort *isn’t optional*. That’s where the **URUWASHI Ribbed Maternity Shorts Over The Belly Seamless 5"" Pregnancy Workout Athletic Biker Shorts for Women** come in. Yeah, the name’s a mouthful, but trust me, these shorts might just save your sanity.

If you’re expecting and want to stay active (or just need something that doesn’t dig into your belly while you’re binge-watching your favorite series), these maternity biker shorts are worth a serious look.

👉 [Check them out on Amazon here.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXSPXWLY?ref=t_ac_view_request_product_image&campaignId=amzn1.campaign.104IEXX55JSV2&linkCode=tr1&tag=cenation1982-20&linkId=amzn1.campaign.104IEXX55JSV2_1765384676162)

# Why Maternity Shorts Even Matter

Ever tried squeezing into your old workout shorts mid-pregnancy? Yeah, it’s like trying to zip up jeans after Thanksgiving dinner—times ten. 😅

**Maternity shorts** aren’t just about fashion; they’re about **comfort, support, and freedom of movement**. The URUWASHI Ribbed Maternity Shorts fit that bill perfectly, blending stretch and structure so you can move (and breathe) without feeling restricted.

**Here’s what makes maternity workout gear so important:**

* **Comfort:** The right fabric can mean the difference between a calm day and one filled with “why did I even wear this?” regret.
* **Support:** A good pair of shorts should gently support your growing belly without pressing too hard.
* **Confidence:** When you feel good in your clothes, it shows—especially when hormones try to convince you otherwise.

So yeah, maternity shorts matter. A lot.

# What Makes the URUWASHI Ribbed Maternity Shorts So Special?

Let’s get into the details that make these shorts stand out in a sea of stretchy fabric.

# 1. Over-the-Belly Design

This is the game-changer. The URUWASHI shorts are designed to **go comfortably over your bump**, providing gentle support without tight bands that dig in. Whether you’re doing prenatal yoga or just lounging around, they move with you.

# 2. Seamless Comfort

No one wants itchy seams, especially when your skin is already extra sensitive. The **seamless design** means fewer friction points and a smoother fit all around.

# 3. Ribbed, Stretchy Fabric

The **ribbed texture** isn’t just for style—it offers light compression and extra stretch. IMO, it’s one of those details that make a big difference once you put them on. They hug your body without suffocating it, which is pretty much the dream during pregnancy.

# 4. 5-Inch Inseam

Perfect length. Not too short, not too long. Just enough coverage to prevent chafing but still keep you cool during workouts or walks.

# 5. Multi-Purpose Wear

Workout? Check. Casual errands? Check. Netflix marathons? Double-check. These shorts work for every part of your day.

# Comfort That Adapts to Every Trimester

Pregnancy isn’t one-size-fits-all, and neither are these shorts. The **URUWASHI design stretches with your bump**, so you can wear them from the first flutter to the final countdown.

And honestly, the stretch is impressive. You don’t feel that annoying “tight band around the middle” issue. It’s like the shorts just *get* you.

I’ve heard from moms who wore them even postpartum because they’re that comfy. Ever wondered if you’ll actually want to keep your maternity clothes after giving birth? This might be one of those rare cases.

# Can You Actually Work Out in These Shorts?

Short answer: **Yes, totally.**

These aren’t just for lounging (though they’re great for that, too). The URUWASHI shorts are made with active moms in mind. Think yoga, Pilates, walking, or light strength training. The stretch and support combo helps you move without constantly adjusting your waistband.

That said, for super high-impact workouts like running or HIIT (if your doctor says that’s OK), you might need additional belly support. But for most prenatal workouts, these do the job beautifully.

# How They Feel (and Why That Matters)

You know when you find leggings or shorts that feel *buttery soft*? That’s what we’re talking about here. The **fabric blend feels smooth and flexible**, without that synthetic “plastic-y” texture.

Some maternity shorts get hot or trap sweat, but these are **breathable and moisture-wicking**, which is key when pregnancy hormones turn you into a personal space heater.

Here’s what you’ll love most about the feel:

* **Soft, ribbed material** that stretches effortlessly.
* **No digging waistbands** or pinching seams.
* **Gentle compression** that gives just enough support to your belly and thighs.

Comfort rating? A solid 10/10, IMO.

# Real-World Use: From Morning Walks to Grocery Runs

Let’s be real—maternity clothes don’t stop at workouts. You’ll probably end up wearing these for everything. I mean, why not? They’re cute enough for errands and comfy enough for naps.

Picture this: morning walk, iced coffee in hand, bump feeling supported, and zero waistband drama. Sounds ideal, right?

Even after pregnancy, they transition smoothly into **postpartum recovery wear**. That’s real value for money right there.

# Possible Downsides (Because No Product Is Perfect)

Every product has its quirks, so let’s be honest about what might not work for everyone.

* **Fit can vary:** Some women mentioned that sizing runs slightly small. If you’re between sizes, go one up.
* **Not for heavy workouts:** While great for yoga and daily wear, they might not provide enough compression for super active routines.
* **Limited color options:** If you’re looking for wild prints or bold colors, these stick to basics.

Still, for the majority of expecting moms, these are minor trade-offs for major comfort.

# Maternity Shorts vs. Regular Biker Shorts

Ever wondered if you could just stick with your regular workout shorts? I get it. But maternity shorts like the URUWASHI ones are built differently.

|Feature|Regular Biker Shorts|URUWASHI Maternity Shorts|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Waistband|Fixed, tight band|Over-belly stretch panel|
|Fabric Stretch|Moderate|Ultra-stretch, seamless|
|Comfort Level|Depends on fit|Designed for growing belly|
|Best For|General workouts|Pregnancy + postpartum|
|Support|Minimal|Gentle belly support|

In short, **regular shorts can’t compete**. Once you’ve felt the comfort of an over-belly design, it’s hard to go back.

# Why Moms Love Them

Reviews (and trust me, I checked a bunch) consistently highlight three things:

1. **“So comfy I forget I’m wearing them.”**
2. **“Finally something that fits all the way through pregnancy.”**
3. **“They look cute enough to wear out.”**

And honestly, those three points sum up exactly what most of us want in maternity wear.

# How to Style Them (Yes, You Can Be Cute and Comfy)

Just because you’re pregnant doesn’t mean you have to give up on style. These shorts pair perfectly with:

* A **cropped maternity tank** for workouts.
* A **loose tee** and sneakers for errands.
* A **soft cardigan** for lounging at home.

You can even throw on a denim jacket and call it an outfit. Pregnant and stylish—who knew? :)

# Where to Buy

You can find the URUWASHI Ribbed Maternity Shorts directly on Amazon. They come in multiple colors, and if you’re lucky, you’ll catch them on sale.

👉 [Grab your pair on Amazon here.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXSPXWLY?ref=t_ac_view_request_product_image&campaignId=amzn1.campaign.104IEXX55JSV2&linkCode=tr1&tag=cenation1982-20&linkId=amzn1.campaign.104IEXX55JSV2_1765384676162)

# Final Thoughts: Worth It? Absolutely.

If you’re on the hunt for maternity shorts that actually deliver on comfort, flexibility, and support, **URUWASHI Ribbed Maternity Shorts** check all the boxes.

They’re ideal for low-impact workouts, casual wear, and those “I just need something comfy” days. And honestly, you’ll probably keep wearing them long after your baby arrives.

Pregnancy comes with enough challenges—finding comfortable clothing shouldn’t be one of them.

So yeah, these shorts get my full thumbs-up. 👏

**Your bump deserves comfort, and you deserve to feel good while rocking it.**

A drive-thru coffee chain raising through Reg CF equity crowdfunding on Jumpstart Micro at $1 per share with 100M shares outstanding.

That chain is 151 Coffee.


What 151 Coffee is going for

151 Coffee is a drive-thru–only coffee concept built around:

Fast, in-and-out drive-thru instead of sit-down cafés

Coffee as a daily habit rather than an occasional treat

Expansion into high-traffic locations like Overland Park, while competing with other coffee players in nearby areas such as Lawrence


The goal: become the default “grab caffeine fast” stop in its markets.


Key numbers from the raise

From the equity crowdfunding deal profile:

Valuation: $100M

Revenue: $13.93M

Net income: - $1.26M (currently operating at a net loss while expanding)

Revenue multiple: ~7.2x

Shares outstanding: 100M

Price per share: $1.00


A mid-eight-figure revenue coffee chain, raising at a nine-figure valuation through Reg CF.


Strengths

Drive-thru focus
Built for speed and convenience, matching commuter and “need coffee now” behavior.

High-frequency category
Coffee is a daily ritual; if 151 Coffee becomes a habit, repeat visits can be very strong.

Expansion into new markets
New locations (e.g., Overland Park) can increase visibility, traffic, and top-line growth.

Customer experience positioning
Emphasis on quick service and experience can support loyalty and pricing power over time.


Risks

Competition
Markets like Lawrence already have other coffee options; that can pressure margins and unit economics.

Capital-intensive growth
Each new drive-thru location requires meaningful upfront spend; underperforming stores weigh on cash.

Net loss profile
The business is currently loss-making; the path to sustainable profitability depends on how well new units ramp.

Marketing and awareness
Staying top-of-mind in a crowded coffee landscape may require ongoing marketing and promo spend.


Where this breakdown comes from

This breakdown is based on a 151 Coffee dashboard inside Owntric, which:

Pulls valuation, revenue, net income, shares, and price per share from the Form C Reg CF filing

Adds an AI summary that highlights what the business does, Strengths, and Risks, grounded in filings and external sources


Owntric is used here as the tool to read the deal; the discussion is about whether this $100M, ~7.2x revenue Reg CF coffee chain profile makes sense.

1pj7i27,https://i.redd.it/af8q4lohoe6g1.jpeg,My Perfume Collection,"1) Bvlgari Man in Black
This was actually my first designer fragrance and a total blind buy and I ended up buying a second bottle, so that says a lot. It’s a warm, spicy leather scent that oozes seduction and works perfectly for date nights. People don’t talk about it enough in this community, but it’s absolutely worth having.
	•	Fragrance: 10/10
	•	Longevity: 10/10
	•	Projection: 7/10

2) Acqua di Giò Profondo 
Super clean, aquatic, and perfect for the office. A very safe, mass-pleasing scent and you really can’t miss with this one. When I first got it, the projection felt weak, but after maceration it performs way better. Longevity + projection are solid now. Definitely a must-have.

3) Givenchy Gentleman Reserve Privee
Blind buy for me. At first, I didn’t like it at all- the iris and the nutty vibe can be a bit much if you’re not used to that style. It’s not mass-pleasing, so don’t blind buy. But with time (and better performance), it’s grown on me. Now I actually appreciate it.

4) Rasasi Dareej ( Not recommended)
This was again a blind buy for buy. Bought on the recommendation of Rahul Sidwan. This one just hasn’t grown on me at all. Every time I spray it, all I get is cumin — nothing else. It leans a bit synthetic and works better as a winter scent, but personally, I don’t enjoy it.
	•	Projection: 10/10
	•	Longevity: Nuclear

5) Rasasi Fattan ( Not recommended)
This was again a blind buy for buy. Bought on the recommendation of Rahul Sidwan. It smells like Kacha Mango bite toffee. Again I dont like this either. But a beast mode fragrance.

6) Guess 1981 Indigo
This one leans warm and very coconut-forward — you can smell that note instantly. It works well as an office scent, but it’s not very versatile overall.
	•	Fragrance: 7/10
	•	Projection: 6/10
	•	Longevity: 5/10

7) Hawas Ice
I’m not a fan of bubblegummy or overly sweet fragrances, and this one falls straight into that category. I expected something fresh and aquatic, but it turned out very bubble-gummy almost identical to Wild Stone Edge. If you’re on a budget, just buy Wild Stone Edge instead; the DNA is the same. I personally don’t like either because they give me a headache.Not gonna buy the full bottle.

8) Hawas Elixir
This one is a clone of JPG Le Male Elixir. It’s extremely sweet,, vanilla-heavy, and just not for me at all. I absolutely hate this style of fragrance so not gonna recommend.

9) French Coffee
I was unsure about this one, especially after seeing mixed reviews calling it “weird.” But honestly, it’s not weird at all — it’s a straight-up sweet, frothy coffee scent. If you like gourmand coffee vibes, you’ll enjoy it.

10) Rare Reef
Very citrusy and aromatic fragrance. Easily my favorite from the batch. Fresh, smooth, and super pleasant. Loved it instantly and I’m definitely buying the full bottle.

11) Noir en leather
This is a clone of Tom Ford Ombre Leather. I’ve smelled the original, and this one is way too synthetic, harsh, and spicy for me. Not something I’d recommend.

We really hit it off and had kind of been messaging each other non-stop since. There was a lot of natural personality chemistry and I genuinely liked him. Then one day, he offered me some emotional support. I accepted and vented to him about some things, and he opened up about some things likewise. I really appreciated this and i felt we had developed a closer friendship and somewhat a connection. The next day, he asked if i wanted to get coffee.  I had a hard time reading this. I have never been asked out before, and I suppose I had hoped that his intentions in asking were to (a) offer further support , or (b) hang out platonically. I really felt connected to him but I just want to say first and foremost that a relationship with him would not have worked for three reasons. Firstly, I personally wasn't attracted to him (which I could look over theoretically). Second, and this is the most important, I have certain religious convictions I feel did not line up with his. Religion is very important to me and in the situation of him being my friend, it doesn't really matter as much what he does religiously, but the sort of relationship he was looking into I just couldn't do that - for fairness to him and for my own standards. Third, I have a crush on  another guy. I actually ended up telling him the fact that I had a crush on another guy, and he was understandably confused. I realize my accepting of the coffee meeting may have been a bad decision and I should've clarified further first and foremost, but I suppose I didn't want to assume anything or make a platonic meet awkward. In the future I will keep this in mind if a guy asks me for ""coffee"" again. I can't help feeling a little hurt though, because I feel as though he used the emotional conversation we had as leverage to get a date, as he was the one who initially suggested the idea that I talk to him. I am not sure if guys in general reserve emotional support for something other than friendships, which would honestly be frustrating, as I am a person who tends to build connection through support, and I think that should be something that exists in all good friendships. But perhaps it is something I need to be wary of. Anyways I feel awkward about the whole situation and can't stop feeling guilty. Feels like I have kicked a puppy out in to the cold. Also I have feelings of disappointment about it too, as I possibly would've been open to a relationship had his religious stance been different.  He is obviously really hurt right now and I feel our friendship is at stake.  I see him for class in a couple days and I am dreading it. ",1,1765385011.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1pj7etx,https://i.redd.it/wgaplr1xne6g1.jpeg,Castenada (Part 34),"*Dream Language, 1996, by Blu Deepwater.*

I started my day with the worst hangover of my entire fucking life. My recollection of last night is a blur, I think I bullshitted my way out of a ticket and maybe hit the strip club about a half hour west of this hick town. I must’ve been trashed because they almost looked half-fuckable for a change. I tossed aside my satin sheets as I leaned over my bedside table for a bump of whatever trash coke I managed to score off of Leo in Seattle. Probably cut with baby laxative, cheap fuck. I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, still fucking handsome, but I need to get back on my skin care routine. Finals are stressing me the fuck out and prom is a week out.

I doubt Jennifer will work out, she never puts out and I think she might be committed to the whole Mormon thing. We were mostly together for appearances, it looks better to date a cheerleader publicly than a skank. Even still, a man has his needs and wants. Maybe one of the others? I had heard a rumor that Kyle Ellis managed to christen Johanna Cramer, a previously believed matron-saint of graduating class of 1999. Maybe she can be coaxed by the apple of an Espinosa.

I got dressed, flexing in the mirror to make sure everything was still tight. Might need to start running again now that football is donezo. I made my way downstairs, sunglasses on. I snapped my fingers and Zachary brought me an espresso. My father looked at me over his morning paper, headline reading “*Caleb Auburn Wins Re-Election*.” I paid him no attention, grabbing a piece of toast from the veritable feast prepared by the staff. I scooped a healthy spoonful of scrambled eggs, felt disgusted, and put some of them back.

“You know, son,” my dad began, folding his paper to look at me. “There’s no need for you to train Zachary to do things for you when you snap your fingers like he’s a trained dog. You possess the capabilities of *verbal* communication, always have.”

“An astute observation, Micheal,” I said before I could bite into my fucking breakfast, so help me God. “I’ll take it into advisement as soon as you stop sleeping around at the golf club.”

His smug grin faded, “For the last time, that was a rumor spread by that Montgomery idiot.”

“What, so you’re incapable of disproving your latent homosexuality against the word of a walking punchline?” I laughed, finally getting my bite, but realizing that I didn’t have the stomach for it so I spat it out.

“Not his word directly, he bribes wait staff at galas and private events to say whatever he thinks will get attention.” he said between sips of coffee, probably to wash out the taste of dick. “It just happened that they talked to the wrong people. It’ll likely blow over in a month’s time.”

“What? Blow over? Woah, Micheal! Gotta go to school.” I said, downing my coffee.

He picked up his paper, “Don’t forget, tonight your granddad is coming over for his birthday dinner.”

“What the fuck does he want? He never comes over unless there’s a death in the family.” In fact, he was probably next in line at however old he was.

“Nonsense, dad comes by all the time, you’re just never around.” he replied.

This wasn’t entirely wrong. I’ve spent a lot of time out of town on each of my breaks to see mom. She had the decent sense to divorce my father and move to Seattle. Likely where I’m heading once I’m done with this shithole. But my grandfather, Charles Espinosa Jr, was not a particularly social man. Not at all, in fact. He had spent many years of his life at his crumbling heap of an estate at the edge of town, wasting away what little time he had clutching onto that massive inheritance I stood to get a cut of once he finally croaked. He had kept his pool of heirs small: his eldest son Micheal, my uncle Robert, and my aunt Vivian.

Micheal was his biggest success of the three, no doubt about it. Robert died when he was young, in a car crash or something, tragic. Vivian is a trust-fund wastrel, using the family’s finances as her personal piggy bank for her numerous plastic surgeries and divorces. Maybe that acting career will start to bear fruit before her skin buckles under the pressure of being warped and broken both by scalpel and Californian sun. Her daughter is no more or less relevant, likely a cocktail waitress or something. Micheal took to running the family business and expanding our profits like a fish to water. As much as I give him shit and resent him in some ways, I respect him at least to that capacity.

I arrived fashionably late to first period. While this may have raised some alarms a few months ago, the end of senior year was fast approaching and most people were either busy with SATs or senior projects. It had been a consistent nuisance to Mr. Perry, but he’s since lost any fight he had in him to stop me this semester. Could be the time of year, could also be the rumored lung cancer diagnosis they’ve been keeping on the down low. Either way, I couldn’t be bothered to give a shit about the civil war or whatever. I took my seat beside Jennifer Bennett, my stand-in girlfriend.

She was obviously hot, otherwise I wouldn’t be caught dead with her. She was the sort of girl-next-door you would see in shitty comedies, like a Jennifer Love-Hewitt or an Alicia Silverstone. She developed early, caught the attention of quite a few boys, but largely remained coy and shy due to her parents’ faith in the Church of Latter Day Saints. Something I had learned about Mormon girls is they’re often begging to rebel, you just have to know how to break them. Jennifer was not easy to break, much to her credit. Sneak out of the house for a midnight movie? Yes. Sex? Different story. Her presence in my life is mostly to uphold the image of being the two most popular seniors in our class. I have a reputation that precedes me in this town, much like a noble heir, when my previous ambition was to assume control over the family business. Now, it’s to…

“Excuse me, Mr. Espinosa.” managed Mr. Perry, clearing his throat. “Would you mind removing your sunglasses in my class?”

A few hushed chuckles followed his request. “I would. It’s bright in here.”

“Mr. Espinosa, if you’re not feeling well I’d suggest you go down to the nurse’s office. Otherwise, please remove your sunglasses.”

I relented just this once, though I could easily keep this up and escalate the matter until my father got involved, but it was a moot point. He was dying on a teacher’s salary anyway. I pocketed the sunglasses, straining to keep my eyes shielded from the burning fluorescents. Jennifer glanced at me with a mischievous smirk, one of the few things that she knew how to do well. She was a cheerleader and had built her personality around being attractive, but there was nothing churning up there. Her ambitions were surface level ideas of going to a state college, getting married, maybe a job in realty, then spawning.

I returned her smirk with a curt one as Mr. Perry droned on: “The Ooikima of the Castenada Valley were originally believed to have been an offshoot of the Molalla peoples, but later research into their language and relative lack of migratory patterns suggests that they led a more sedentary lifestyle than previously believed, though they had certain brief cultural exchanges between themselves, the Cosalish, and Plateau Natives, as evidenced by certain customs each observed. A great deal of the Ooikima language is lost to history, but what examples have managed to survive are indicative of a linguistic isolate, similar to Korean or Basque. This indicates that they may have possibly migrated into the valley tens of thousands of years ago and had little contact with the outside world prior to the arrival of the Johan Nero Mission.”

A braceleted hand shot up. Logan fucking Deepwater, of course. Any time Mr. Perry decided to talk specifically about local history that was even tangentially tied to either my ancestors or his, he felt the need to cry about how the founders of this town were colonizers and about how it wasn’t fair that they were too dumb to invent guns or whatever.

“Yes, Mr. Deepwater?” Mr. Perry asked, likely to spite me.

“Something else I’d like to point out that my granny Kála taught me was that we had certain traditions associated with different places around town. We even had hidden paths through the mountains that only we knew. And we had names specific for all these places.”

“Who cares?” I chimed, having finally had my fill. I got a few laughs of support, though I could tell some of them had clutched their pearls. Logan turned to look at me. He didn’t look angry or upset, he just smiled at me confused.

“Hey man,” he said half laughing like an arrogant prick. “I’m just sharing what I know about my heritage.”

“Yeah, I know what you’re doing.” I shot back. “You’ve been doing it all semester. No one cares.”

“Okay, buddy.” He turned back around, dismissing me. 

But I wasn’t done with him, “Maybe you can save it for that dyke.”

“Mr. Espinosa!” Mr. Perry interjected. “Go to the hall and wait for me!”

“Wait for you? To do what? This asshole has been pushing me all semester and you allowed it.”

“Someone should push you off a cliff, *biiiiitch*.” A voice chimed from the back corner. The whole class, including Logan Deepwater, erupted in laughter, humiliating me. I didn’t have to turn and look to know that it was Zeke Chambers. As well-known and well-liked as I was, no one had the social mobility of Zeke. It was inexplicable. He wasn’t quite a class clown, though he could easily moonlight as one. He ran track, which wasn’t quite as prestigious a sport as football or wrestling, but enough to get his photo on more than one page in the yearbook for the last few years. He was one of the few black people in Castenada, which you would think would make him feel ostracized in a majority white school, but it didn’t. More importantly, he had no reservations about who he appeared with in public. He had no name attached to him, he just got to be Zeke Chambers. Even in my anger at being humiliated, I can’t help but be envious of him.

“Mr. Chambers, I heard that. Please apologize to Mr. Espinosa.” Mr. Perry said firmly.

“Sorry, bitch.” Zeke said nonchalantly. “Won’t happen again, bitch.”

Again, the whole class started howling with laughter. Logan looked like he was about to fall out of his chair.

“Very well, Mr. Chambers. You can join Mr. Espinosa in the hall.”

There was a chide of “oo’s” and “oh’s” as we got out of our respective seats and made our way to the door. Knowing Mr. Perry’s style, he would take a minute before coming to the door which would give me that much time to put Chambers in his place. He wasn’t very physically intimidating compared to me and in a moment where he wouldn’t have his peanut gallery to back him would give me the opportune moment to lay into him. But how? Racial slurs could shock him, but I found that business unsavory if it ever came back to bite me. Maybe physical violence? Not enough to start an actual fight, but enough to show that I know how and I’m not going to be mocked. Yeah, that’s it.

I turned to face Zeke as we left the classroom. Before I had a chance to say anything, that blue-haired freak rounded the corner. Even later than I was, evidently. Yet another no-name, Evan Brooks. I couldn’t tell you much about him, other than he apparently liked nu metal and was friends with Zeke. He had come up to us wearing his headphones. Zeke stopped him on his way. Evan jeered, “Fuck off, I’m listening to Static-X!”

Zeke pulled off his headphones, “Fuck on. I got kicked out of class.”

“What for? Making out with your boyfriend here?” he joked.

“Am I just a joke to all of you?” I asked. “Do you not know who I am or who my family is? Do you realize that we own half of this town that you all reside in?”

“No one cares, bitch.” Zeke said before turning back to Evan. “By the way, we meeting at The Black Warp later?”

“*Excuse* you!?” I grabbed Zeke by the collar. He wasn’t very heavy and not too strong to resist me. Before I had a chance to throw the first punch, I saw a bright flash in one eye followed by a burst of immediate pain. Evan Brooks had punched me in the fucking eye.

“You’re excused, bitch!” Zeke added before both of them took off running down the hall. By the time Mr. Perry had come out, they were gone. He noticed me rubbing my eye which was involuntarily tearing up.

“Go to the nurse’s office, get some ice on it and some ibuprofen. You should be fine.” he said.

“Should be fine!?” I shot back. “I would’ve been fine had you not taken your time to come out here! When my father hears about this, you’re going to be fired!”

“Your father will be hearing about this from me, including the part where you interrupted another student and remind him that you’ve routinely disrupted my class at any given opportunity. It frankly astonishes me how your GPA isn’t in the toilet.”

“It frankly astonishes me that you’re still alive…” A bitter jest with no one to hear it, very unbecoming.

“Unfortunately for you, Mr. Espinosa, I’m fighting this thing to the bitter end because unlike you I actually care about the education of your classmates. I care about their prospects, their ambitions, their futures. You only seem to care about, what, looking cool and showing up late for class every week? Getting in a word edgewise to put others beneath you? If and when you graduate, you will come to understand that life is much more difficult than you’ve allowed yourself to believe up to this point. Maybe then you’ll begin to empathize with other people, but I sincerely and sadly have my doubts. Good luck to you, Mr. Espinosa. Don’t bother coming back to my class until you learn to conduct yourself like an adult.”

Maybe it was the hangover, but I couldn’t think of anything to say so I left. I caught a glimpse of my reflection in a window as I stalked the mostly empty halls and could already see a bruise forming on my left eye. The skin was already inflamed and would likely get worse if I couldn’t get the swelling down. Prom photos would be permanently marked with this shame, a reminder to my future heirs that I allowed a nobody to beat me and walk away. How could I explain this to future generations of Espinosas if I simply allowed this to happen? No, that wouldn’t do. Evan Brooks, Zeke Chambers, Logan Deepwater, James Perry. Each of them would need to suffer. That bitch of a girlfriend of mine did nothing, said nothing. As far as I was concerned, we were done. I’ve been too soft handed for this work and it was time for me to work my way into the orbit of Johanna Cramer. Passable enough to obfuscate my intentions, perhaps I could spin her reputation as a rumor, maybe pull strings with the Barrera sisters and the drama club. I would no longer be subjected to the stringent standards I had imposed on myself to idly rule over sheep. 

They would need to cower and fear me.

1pj7eii,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1pj7eii/rant_i_am_losing_my_patience_with_one_of_my/,*Rant* I am losing my patience with one of my roommates.,"\*This is very long and a little boring. I just wanted to get all of this off my chest.

I rent a house with 3 other people. We are all women in our early to mid-20's.

I've lived here for about a year and a half. For the most part, it is great. The house is cute, the rent is cheap, and we all get along pretty well. I have no intention of moving out, primarily because of how inexpensive my rent is.

But I do have complaints about one of my roommates. It's getting to the point that I feel like I am losing my patience. I want to maintain a friendly relationship with her because we do share the same space, and she is also a nice person.

But she does not do a single thing around the house. She doesn't clean. She doesn't do the dishes. She doesn't take the trash outside, even if the can is visibly full. She doesn't take the can to the end of the driveway.

She has used my things without asking. I have a coffee travel mug that I take to work in the mornings. She asked me if she could use it one day that I didn't have to go into work. Of course, I allowed her to. She created a habit out of this, and she stopped asking. One day, my mug disappeared, and I didn't see it for a long time. She came out of her room one day and casually told me, ""Sorry, I've been keeping this hostage in my room for a month."" It was my mug. She ended up buying herself one a few days later, so I don't deal with that anymore.

  
I make myself coffee every single morning. I have a drip coffee machine and I grind my beans (haha). I also allow her to use my coffee machine, but she has her own ground coffee that she uses. One evening before I left, I noticed that my coffee beans were low. I had just enough to make myself 1 cup of coffee the next morning. When I returned home that morning, I noticed that my coffee beans were gone. She used the last of my coffee without even asking me. She is aware that I make coffee every single morning. She left a little bit in the grinder, thinking that would be enough for me to make coffee. It wasn't even half of what I usually use.

I buy hand soap and tissues to keep in the kitchen. Yes, I have dish soap, but I want to use hand soap to wash my hands when I'm cooking. Well, one day, I noticed that it was gone. It was in her bathroom, because she ran out of hand soap. I take it and put it back in the kitchen. The next day, my hand soap is not the kitchen again. Just take a guess of where it was. Back in her bathroom. Of course, I take it back and put it back in the kitchen. Same thing with the tissues. She took the whole damn box to her room because she was sick. I get it, but I bought those and they're obviously not for you to take to your room. At least, it was obvious to me. So, yesterday, I bought another box of tissues, and I wrote ""keep in kitchen please"". She saw it, laughed, and said, ""Is that because of me?"" Of course it was.

  
She is very friendly, extroverted, and funny. She doesn't cook, so she doesn't really make a mess. She \*does\* clean the small amount of dishes that she uses for herself, but that's it. I and one of our other roommates are the only ones who will wash/put away dishes that are not ours. It's just aggravating because I feel like I am carrying most of the weight on my shoulders. I sweep and mop, dust, clean the counters, and scrub the bathroom. I have a full time job just like everyone else in the house, I have a boyfriend, and I go to the gym. One of my roommates is decent at cleaning, but she is also busy with school and she honestly is not home a lot.

  
Outside of these issues, there are other things about her that aggravate me, but that it is a story for another day. Our personalities, values, and beliefs clash, but I tend to be a peacekeeper, so I try to not make it super obvious. On the surface, we get along well, but I really no longer enjoy her company.

I feel like I need to address this, but I don't know how. I am not always the best at speaking my mind because it feels like confrontation, which I do not like.",1,1765384959.0,badroommates,5,0.66,False

While some of these things are important, it can also be rewarding to take a step back, and focus on problems in our communities that we *can* solve. I recently got into property renovation, and it’s been a very rewarding experience. I’m building a physical, real thing that helps a real, physical person. 

So, what are some things that are needed in your community, or problems that your community is facing? I’m personally thinking about it in terms of businesses, but there’s no reason the same couldn’t be applied to non-profits or other solutions. 

Here are some problems in my area (KOP/Norristown/Conshohocken):

* High rents. There’s a shortage of housing, and there’s a big opportunity to build more housing in our area. 

* Grocery costs. They’re really high at the moment. But, I find that a lot of these come from brand-name prepared products, and prices for staples (store brand canned goods, meat, milk) are a lot more reasonable and competitive between stores. 

* Vending machines. It’d be nice to put some on places like the suburban SEPTA platforms, with a cold drinks in the summer and warm coffee in the winter. I think one in my local park would do well too. 

* I’d love a good Ethiopian and Sichuan place. Not a ton around my area. 

* Transparency/more insight for services pricing. After 3 years, I’ve finally found a Vet that I love and that charges reasonable prices. I expect I will be a customer of theirs for a long time. But my process was basically trying different ones until I found one I liked. I still need to find a regular doctor. The whole process of finding providers like this is so un-optimized.

Obviously, not all of these are serious issues. Being able to get a hot coffee while waiting for SEPTA isn’t exactly anybody’s idea of a “serious problem”. But it’s an interesting exercise. What are some issues in your community you see?",2,1765384659.0,Pennsylvania,3,0.67,False

My parents divorced when I was a kid, I stayed living with her, and she very quickly turned me into her built in best friend. We text every day, she calls multiple times a day ""just to check in"", and if I go more than a couple days without seeing her she starts joking that I have ""abandoned my poor lonely mother"". On top of that she is obsessed with her side of the family. Her favorite person in the world is her aunt ""Maria"", my great aunt. Mom talks about her constantly, tells the same stories from their childhood, and when Maria visits from out of state it basically becomes a multi day festival where my mom is glued to her side and narrates every interaction. I love Aunt Maria a lot, but any time she is around with my mom there it turns into my mom performing their relationship instead of letting anyone have a normal conversation. If I try to get a word in, mom interrupts with ""oh let me tell her this one, you were too little to remember"". For years I have felt like an extra in their show.  

A few weeks ago Aunt Maria came to town for a funeral on her husbands side. She texted me separately and said she had an afternoon free, asked if I wanted to grab coffee near my work. She did not mention inviting my mom, and my first instinct was honestly a huge wave of relief. I have never had one on one time with her as an adult. I hesitated because I could already hear my mom's reaction in my head, but then I thought I am a grown woman, this is also my relative and it is not illegal to see her without my mom present. So I said yes, we met at a cafe, and it was genuinely really nice. We talked about my job, my plans to maybe move, some old family stuff from my point of view, and she even apologized for not realizing how much pressure my mom put on me when I was a teenager. It was calm, nobody cried or made speeches, I did not have to translate my feelings into something that made my mom look good. I went home feeling weirdly lighter. I decided not to mention it to my mom right away, partly because I knew she would make it about herself and partly because it just felt nice to have one thing that was mine for a second. That lasted about four days.  

Mom was on the phone with Aunt Maria and I guess she asked if they had seen me. Maria very casually said ""oh yes, I had coffee with her on Tuesday, she seems to be doing well"". According to my mom she hung up and immediately started crying. I got a wall of texts about how hurt she was that I ""went behind her back"", that I ""stole"" her aunt from her, that I know how important that relationship is to her and still chose to exclude her. When we talked in person she said it felt like I had ""replaced"" her with Aunt Maria as my new mother figure. I tried to explain that I just wanted one quiet conversation, that I talk to my mom all the time but I almost never see Maria, and that I am allowed to have my own connections in the family. She said if I wanted that I should have ""introduced it gently"" and invited them both, that lying by omission is still lying, and that now she does not trust me. She has also told a couple of cousins that I am ""sneaking around"" with her aunt and trying to turn her against her. One cousin said they get why mom feels left out but also that it is not that deep, we just had coffee. I am starting to second guess myself, because I did know this would upset her which is why I kept quiet. On the other hand I am exhausted from being treated like moms emotional support animal and not a separate person.  

TLDR: My great aunt asked me, a 27F, to grab coffee while she was in town. I went, did not tell my very attached mom, and we finally had a normal one on one talk. When my mom found out she said I betrayed her by ""sneaking around"" with her favorite aunt and is now acting like I broke her trust. AITJ for not inviting my mom or telling her before.

1pj76qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pj76qq/hushlands/,Hushlands,"There are days I wish I had done something to save Jeremy Tillman. It’s been twenty years, and it all started with the beta for Hushlands.

Jeremy Tillman was one year senior, and we used to collaborate frequently, both of us being game designers. Actually, my career began with him, as he was the first person to approach me—back in high school—to help him create graphics and help with sound effects for his small independent game. This was back in the 90s, when shareware titles littered the PC gaming landscape, so it was quite a shock to both of us when a bigger game company signed us up for their newest title in the works: “Gorgon 3D.”

A simple Doom clone running on an inferior engine—nothing special, but thanks to Jeremy’s eye for coding smooth and satisfying controls and my artistic sensibilities, the game became quite an unexpected small success. The company itself never put much faith into the project, but after it proved to be of a much higher quality upon release than expected, they offered us more work.

After a few years, we were making better and bigger games—our team rising in its number of members with every successive title. When the early 2000s hit, we were on top of the world, getting ready to work on the biggest project yet:

Hushlands.

It was a grand CRPG affair set in a surreal fantasy world mixing your usual Tolkien-inspired tropes with my own “original” ideas (that I’ve unashamedly borrowed from esoteric and lesser-known foreign literature that I was consuming huge amounts of back then). The titular Hushlands would need many artists and coders to bring to life, so we’ve set out on a mission to find the best of the best. After assembling a team that would make Id Software in their prime look like a bunch of amateurs, we began to work on the game proper.

Hushlands was taking its time, but the publisher was happy as long as the work progressed forward. After three years of development, we’ve finally completed the first beta version—which was about 70% of the final intended release. Back then, advertising was everything, so the publisher insisted on creating as much hype around the game as possible. Jeremy protested, however, and made sure that no news, or even rumors of the game’s production, would leak out—much to the annoyance of our publisher.

He insisted on keeping the project as secret as possible. No one, not even I, knew why he seemed so paranoid about this. After all, isn't this sort of sneak-peeking a good thing for a game? But he remained unmoved by the publisher’s demands and our suggestions. He grew more and more eccentric and started becoming a different person altogether. To me, this transformation was particularly uncanny, as I knew him for such a long time—the cheerful Jeremy became gradually replaced with a much moodier and grimmer workaholic. He would sleep in his chair in front of the computer—which he never turned off—and became basically buried in tasks the nature or use of which he would never disclose to us.

“Bug fixes and engine adjustments.” – That's all he would ever say to us.

He started to write endless notes to himself at all times, as if his memory started to fail him more and more—his desk becoming covered in square sticky notes, some even layered on top of each other. One day - while I made him coffee - I noticed one particular note that read, “Hurry up!”

Eventually, after a particularly heated phone argument with the publisher, he approached me with a strange glimmer in his eyes, which I took as a sign that he had a brand new idea for something.

“Tell you what…” he started, his voice raspy and shaky. “I’ll… I-I’ll implement s-something that will make these idiots shut up in t-two weeks at the beta version showcase they d-d-demanded so damn much!”

“Jeremy, relax!” I tried to calm him down, as his now-coffee-addicted body shook visibly when he said that sentence. “You are working way too hard on this game; just take a small vacation for a week or so! Me and the guys will complete th-”

“In two weeks!!!” he snarled at me with a ferocity I’d never expect from any of my friends. “You will see,” he added as he closed the door.

For the entire two weeks, he worked entirely confined to his desk, leaving it only to use the toilet. He became so fixed on implementing whatever he deemed so important that nobody could even manage to begin to talk to him. All everyone got back from him was a wave of a hand and a quiet snarl.

The day before that beta showcase, he finally approached me and the team, saying:

“Well! All is ready! These suckers will be blown out of their goddamn socks once they see what I’ve cooked up!”

In his hand, he proudly held the disc with “Hushlands Beta 2.1” written on it. We didn’t even question him at that point; we all knew that he was a very talented programmer—definitely the most talented member of our company—but something about this didn’t seem right at all. Worrying that he might’ve actually gone insane because he took on so much work, I discreetly decided to take the disc to my place and see what this new beta version looked like on my own. I suspected that whatever Jeremy had added might’ve been too “out there” to be shown tomorrow, as he used to tell me in private that his biggest dream would be to create a game that would shock people more than any other. He laughed at games like Harvester—notorious for its violence and dark themes—saying that if he had the time and opportunity, he would “make Harvester look like an educational game for toddlers in comparison.”

Having that in mind, I suspected his worsening mental state could make him put some edgy, graphic, or even sexual stuff into the game without my knowledge—thus jeopardizing our beta presentation, which would lead to the game losing its publisher—and that would be a big blow to our team.

While driving back to my home—which was near our office—I glanced at the CD sitting in its case. I was more and more curious as to what I would see once I booted it up on my computer. As I closed the front door behind me and fired up the PC, I sighed, remembering all our previous projects. Gorgon 3D and its crude title screen drawn by me on my own Amiga 500 flashed before my eyes—the memory of quieter and more humble times. I shook my head, regaining composure, and put the disc into the tray. The folder with the game popped up—HSHLNDS\_B\_2.1.EXE staring right back at me from my monitor. Besides the usual game files and some leftover concept art for reference, there was also a text file. Boldly titled ""!!!READMEEEEEE.txt"".

I opened it without much thought. “Probably a list of to-do stuff from Jeremy.” I thought. But I was not ready for what I’ve stumbled upon. The text file was massive—at least 10,000 words long. As I read it, much to my shock, it turned out to be Jeremy’s manifesto of sorts. He described his career leading up to Hushlands and his collaboration with me. He described me as a “good, but sentimental friend.” I didn’t know whether this was a compliment or not, but I read further.

“Hushlands is the opportunity that I’ve waited for. The technological progress of the past few years provided me with the ability to finally create something that I was dreaming of creating since my teens. I am proud of the work I did on this game. I’m sure anyone who plays the game will feel a new kind of emotion. Not fear nor excitement—something beyond that.”

His ramblings became angrier as the text evolved into downright schizophrenic ramblings near the end. All the while, it seemed to me that he took the entire credit for the game—this made me feel angry and annoyed at him. I decided to confront him with this tomorrow before our presentation. I couldn’t let him get away with disrespecting me and the other members of our team.

“We’ve all worked our asses off, and that’s how he behaves now?” I mumbled to myself as I closed the text out of anger.

I took a sip of beer and opened the .EXE file, bracing myself for whatever awaited me.

The title screen, along with the theme song, played as planned—the detailed Hushlands logo appeared along with the main menu. Instead of the “New Game” option, there was “PRESENTATION START” written in a standard system font.

“He didn’t even change the font?” I sighed. “Jeremy, what the hell did you do during these two weeks?”

I clicked the presentation option and waited as the game loaded. The black screen featured only the main character of the game—an elf protagonist named Sylva. His animation, voice acting, and other essential elements were fully completed, but for some inexplicable reason, Jeremy replaced his voice. Gone was the professional voice work we focused so much on—he now sounded like a mess of low-quality stock voices jumbled together.

“Fucking hell!” I angrily sneered. “How the fuck does he expect this to impress our publisher?”

I was just about to call Jeremy, demanding him to explain this mess, when the character started moving on its own. I watched as Sylva walked about in the total darkness until a green glow appeared. This turned out to be a portal that transported him into the Prilma Dungeon—one of the locations we’ve planned to create but decided to cut out of the project due to its huge size. But here I saw a finished, high-quality location filled with detail, careful texturing, and magnificent lighting effects!

“Oh my God.” I whispered. “Jeremy, did you do this all by yourself?”

Sylva was now standing still. I started to control him to explore the dungeon. I was floored, as this looked at least ten times better than anything we'd created up to that point. Hell, not even the biggest AAA games of that year could compare. If this was shown to the publisher, they would truly be amazed! But, that strange voice replacement. Why?

As I started wondering about this bizarre decision, Sylva spoke. I recognized the line from one of the hundreds of stock voice & FX CDs we would use. It was your usual “old wizard” voice.

“It seems my spell worked well!”

I puzzled over the meaning of this. What spell?

As I moved Sylva across the dungeon, I marveled further at Jeremy’s achievement. Along the way, some enemies appeared, but Sylva took them out no problem. The animations and combat worked perfectly, so I started to relax a little. Aside from the missing voice, we didn’t have to worry about disappointing the publisher! I leaned back in my chair and took a sip of beer. I grabbed my phone and wanted to call Jeremy, but then I thought of how angry he would be with me if he found out that I'd sneaked the CD out of our studio. Also, I started to remember the bizarre manifesto of his and wondered what its true meaning was.

I then realized how impossible it was for one man to do all this work by himself and in just two weeks. There was just no way he could do it without at least a dozen other artists and coders working 24/7, and even then I’m not sure if the result would be so… polished? Spectacular? There really was no way to describe it. That’s when I started to feel fear—fear of something being fundamentally wrong. I finally understood its source—I was staring at something that had no right to exist. The level kept on going, showing no sign of any bugs or any deficiency—it was just too perfect to be a single human’s creation.

That’s when my phone rang. It made me jump, as my entire focus was on the game. I answered it, expecting to hear from Jeremy. Sure enough, it was him—his calm voice sent shivers down my spine.

“So? How’d you like it?”

I couldn’t speak—my jaw hung from its hinges from shock as my eyes darted around my room, the feeling of being watched just too strong to ignore.

“J-Jeremy?” I struggled to respond. “How… How do you-”

“It’s simple,” he responded—again, the unnatural calm in his voice petrifying me. “When involving yourself in something so important, a single human can do wonders. Especially when he’s got help.”

“From whom?” I asked, my face wet from cold sweat.

He laughed a cold and ruthless chuckle that might as well have come from the devil himself.

“Oh, you know,” he responded as I struggled to regain composure, grabbing the can of beer I'd been drinking from in the process.

“Ooh… Told ‘ya before that beer does not help with artistic endeavors, didn't I?”

The can fell to the ground as I froze in place, Jeremy Tillman’s laugh still ringing in my ears.

“H-how do you…?” I choked out an answer.

I quickly rose from my seat, ran up to the window, and looked outside—hoping that this was just a cruel prank to get back at me for snatching the beta CD.

“No, no, no!” he chuckled. “I ain’t there!”

I started frantically searching through my closets, other rooms of the home, and even under the tables—sure enough, I was all alone with no way of anyone knowing what I was doing.

""Don't bother looking under the bed. You are a big boy and don’t believe in monsters, right?"" he laughed mockingly.

Jeremy mockingly commented on my every move. Finally, I grabbed a book from my shelf and opened it on a random page.

“Ooh! Grave’s “Greek Myths”! The Argo’s journey was my personal favorite!”

I looked at my copy of Robert Graves's Greek Myths, opened to the chapter discussing the myth of the Argonauts and their quest for the golden fleece.

“I still remember how we would look through this book for inspiration when creating Gorgon 3D. Good times, huh?”

I screamed and threw the book away. Jeremy’s voice being too much to bear, I turned off the phone and returned to my desk, only to find a horrific picture displayed on my PC monitor. It was a close-up of Sylva’s face—pixelated and mangled. His eyes were nowhere to be seen—replaced by deep, dark, gaping holes. I tried to close the game, but the entire PC froze on that image, the GPU and hard drive making as much noise as possible. Speakers were filled with static as I moved the mouse and worked the keyboard to no use. Having no other way to get rid of this nightmare, I grabbed the power cable and yanked it out of the socket, putting an end to this nightmare.

My ride back to the office was frantic and dangerous, my head reverberating with thoughts that defied rationality. I opened the door and entered the dimly-lit office at 1 AM, expecting to see no one. But Jeremy waited for me. Sitting in his chair - as always in front of his computer—dead, with an empty, emotionless expression on his pale and cold face. I cried as my shaky hands called for an ambulance, but it was too late. They declared him deceased on the spot. Cause of death? Nobody could figure that out. Police investigated but found no traces of foul play. It wasn’t a suicide—that was their only certainty.

His PC was on when I found him—the screen displaying the game’s unfinished code. The sound of the computer’s cooling fans and the hard drive reminded me of human breathing - no one else noticed it as I turned the PC off, before giving it over to the authorities for forensic analysis. They found nothing that they could tie to his death and closed the case soon after, deciding that Jeremy died from “work exhaustion.”

Hushlands wasn’t canceled. The project was renamed with a different title that came out to much critical reception and big sales. I don’t want to tell you what the title of that game is. All I can say is that it’s a CRPG with a top-down perspective. I, and the rest of the team, had to work over Jeremy’s work—a strange mix of guilt and fear that I do not wish upon anyone. The knowledge that some of Jeremy’s assets that materialized during those two weeks remained in the final product haunts me to this day.

It was decided that Jeremy Tillman’s name was to be removed from the credits.

Back to that manifesto and beta disc. Once I made sure that my PC was working fine after rebooting, I ejected it, broke the goddamn thing in half, and threw it away. Anticlimactic, I know. Before doing that, however, I backed up the text file—if there were any answers to this entire madness, I was sure to find them there. I mustered up the courage to read Jeremy’s manifesto in detail, finding strange names, chaos magick and Neoplatonism. The name of Engelbrecht of Bonn came up quite a bit in the latter sections. I did some digging later and found this description of him and his teachings:

From “The Early Magicians of the Renaissance” (1872) by Dr. Klemens Ignacy Górski—chapter 12, pgs. 120-121:

*“Meister Engelbrecht von Bonn was known to be one especially talented magician that utilized the teachings of Cornellius Agrippa and other contemporary theoreticians to much practical success - invoking, among many others, angels, demons, lesser deities of various celestial bodies, guardian spirits of towns, deities of elementa principalia, and the artes liberales. In one particular case, he succeeded in creating a dazzling fresco at the town hall of Kalisz, Poland. What would’ve taken a dozen artisans to complete in a month, he managed to execute in a mere week, much to the town authorities’ and local clergy’s astonishment. Also, around that time, he surprised Barnim XI, the Duke of Pomerania, by painting on canvas an uncanny face in such a convincing way that, upon observing it closely, one would swear that its eyes could follow their movements. Some claimed, that the face’s eyes would even turn into deep, dark wells at Engelbrecht’s will, much to the terror of spectators.”*",1,1765384480.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

After assembling a team that would make Id Software in their prime look like a bunch of amateurs, we began to work on the game proper.

Hushlands was taking its time, but the publisher was happy as long as the work progressed forward. After three years of development, we’ve finally completed the first beta version—which was about 70% of the final intended release. Back then, advertising was everything, so the publisher insisted on creating as much hype around the game as possible. Jeremy protested, however, and made sure that no news, or even rumors of the game’s production, would leak out—much to the annoyance of our publisher.

He insisted on keeping the project as secret as possible. No one, not even I, knew why he seemed so paranoid about this. After all, isn't this sort of sneak-peeking a good thing for a game? But he remained unmoved by the publisher’s demands and our suggestions. He grew more and more eccentric and started becoming a different person altogether. To me, this transformation was particularly uncanny, as I knew him for such a long time—the cheerful Jeremy became gradually replaced with a much moodier and grimmer workaholic. He would sleep in his chair in front of the computer—which he never turned off—and became basically buried in tasks the nature or use of which he would never disclose to us.

“Bug fixes and engine adjustments.” – That's all he would ever say to us.

He started to write endless notes to himself at all times, as if his memory started to fail him more and more—his desk becoming covered in square sticky notes, some even layered on top of each other. One day - while I made him coffee - I noticed one particular note that read, “Hurry up!”

Eventually, after a particularly heated phone argument with the publisher, he approached me with a strange glimmer in his eyes, which I took as a sign that he had a brand new idea for something.

“Tell you what…” he started, his voice raspy and shaky. “I’ll… I-I’ll implement s-something that will make these idiots shut up in t-two weeks at the beta version showcase they d-d-demanded so damn much!”

“Jeremy, relax!” I tried to calm him down, as his now-coffee-addicted body shook visibly when he said that sentence. “You are working way too hard on this game; just take a small vacation for a week or so! Me and the guys will complete th-”

“In two weeks!!!” he snarled at me with a ferocity I’d never expect from any of my friends. “You will see,” he added as he closed the door.

For the entire two weeks, he worked entirely confined to his desk, leaving it only to use the toilet. He became so fixed on implementing whatever he deemed so important that nobody could even manage to begin to talk to him. All everyone got back from him was a wave of a hand and a quiet snarl.

The day before that beta showcase, he finally approached me and the team, saying:

“Well! All is ready! These suckers will be blown out of their goddamn socks once they see what I’ve cooked up!”

In his hand, he proudly held the disc with “Hushlands Beta 2.1” written on it. We didn’t even question him at that point; we all knew that he was a very talented programmer—definitely the most talented member of our company—but something about this didn’t seem right at all. Worrying that he might’ve actually gone insane because he took on so much work, I discreetly decided to take the disc to my place and see what this new beta version looked like on my own. I suspected that whatever Jeremy had added might’ve been too “out there” to be shown tomorrow, as he used to tell me in private that his biggest dream would be to create a game that would shock people more than any other. He laughed at games like Harvester—notorious for its violence and dark themes—saying that if he had the time and opportunity, he would “make Harvester look like an educational game for toddlers in comparison.”

Having that in mind, I suspected his worsening mental state could make him put some edgy, graphic, or even sexual stuff into the game without my knowledge—thus jeopardizing our beta presentation, which would lead to the game losing its publisher—and that would be a big blow to our team.

While driving back to my home—which was near our office—I glanced at the CD sitting in its case. I was more and more curious as to what I would see once I booted it up on my computer. As I closed the front door behind me and fired up the PC, I sighed, remembering all our previous projects. Gorgon 3D and its crude title screen drawn by me on my own Amiga 500 flashed before my eyes—the memory of quieter and more humble times. I shook my head, regaining composure, and put the disc into the tray. The folder with the game popped up—HSHLNDS\_B\_2.1.EXE staring right back at me from my monitor. Besides the usual game files and some leftover concept art for reference, there was also a text file. Boldly titled ""!!!READMEEEEEE.txt"".

I opened it without much thought. “Probably a list of to-do stuff from Jeremy.” I thought. But I was not ready for what I’ve stumbled upon. The text file was massive—at least 10,000 words long. As I read it, much to my shock, it turned out to be Jeremy’s manifesto of sorts. He described his career leading up to Hushlands and his collaboration with me. He described me as a “good, but sentimental friend.” I didn’t know whether this was a compliment or not, but I read further.

“Hushlands is the opportunity that I’ve waited for. The technological progress of the past few years provided me with the ability to finally create something that I was dreaming of creating since my teens. I am proud of the work I did on this game. I’m sure anyone who plays the game will feel a new kind of emotion. Not fear nor excitement—something beyond that.”

His ramblings became angrier as the text evolved into downright schizophrenic ramblings near the end. All the while, it seemed to me that he took the entire credit for the game—this made me feel angry and annoyed at him. I decided to confront him with this tomorrow before our presentation. I couldn’t let him get away with disrespecting me and the other members of our team.

“We’ve all worked our asses off, and that’s how he behaves now?” I mumbled to myself as I closed the text out of anger.

I took a sip of beer and opened the .EXE file, bracing myself for whatever awaited me.

The title screen, along with the theme song, played as planned—the detailed Hushlands logo appeared along with the main menu. Instead of the “New Game” option, there was “PRESENTATION START” written in a standard system font.

“He didn’t even change the font?” I sighed. “Jeremy, what the hell did you do during these two weeks?”

I clicked the presentation option and waited as the game loaded. The black screen featured only the main character of the game—an elf protagonist named Sylva. His animation, voice acting, and other essential elements were fully completed, but for some inexplicable reason, Jeremy replaced his voice. Gone was the professional voice work we focused so much on—he now sounded like a mess of low-quality stock voices jumbled together.

“Fucking hell!” I angrily sneered. “How the fuck does he expect this to impress our publisher?”

I was just about to call Jeremy, demanding him to explain this mess, when the character started moving on its own. I watched as Sylva walked about in the total darkness until a green glow appeared. This turned out to be a portal that transported him into the Prilma Dungeon—one of the locations we’ve planned to create but decided to cut out of the project due to its huge size. But here I saw a finished, high-quality location filled with detail, careful texturing, and magnificent lighting effects!

“Oh my God.” I whispered. “Jeremy, did you do this all by yourself?”

Sylva was now standing still. I started to control him to explore the dungeon. I was floored, as this looked at least ten times better than anything we'd created up to that point. Hell, not even the biggest AAA games of that year could compare. If this was shown to the publisher, they would truly be amazed! But, that strange voice replacement. Why?

As I started wondering about this bizarre decision, Sylva spoke. I recognized the line from one of the hundreds of stock voice & FX CDs we would use. It was your usual “old wizard” voice.

“It seems my spell worked well!”

I puzzled over the meaning of this. What spell?

As I moved Sylva across the dungeon, I marveled further at Jeremy’s achievement. Along the way, some enemies appeared, but Sylva took them out no problem. The animations and combat worked perfectly, so I started to relax a little. Aside from the missing voice, we didn’t have to worry about disappointing the publisher! I leaned back in my chair and took a sip of beer. I grabbed my phone and wanted to call Jeremy, but then I thought of how angry he would be with me if he found out that I'd sneaked the CD out of our studio. Also, I started to remember the bizarre manifesto of his and wondered what its true meaning was.

I then realized how impossible it was for one man to do all this work by himself and in just two weeks. There was just no way he could do it without at least a dozen other artists and coders working 24/7, and even then I’m not sure if the result would be so… polished? Spectacular? There really was no way to describe it. That’s when I started to feel fear—fear of something being fundamentally wrong. I finally understood its source—I was staring at something that had no right to exist. The level kept on going, showing no sign of any bugs or any deficiency—it was just too perfect to be a single human’s creation.

That’s when my phone rang. It made me jump, as my entire focus was on the game. I answered it, expecting to hear from Jeremy. Sure enough, it was him—his calm voice sent shivers down my spine.

“So? How’d you like it?”

I couldn’t speak—my jaw hung from its hinges from shock as my eyes darted around my room, the feeling of being watched just too strong to ignore.

“J-Jeremy?” I struggled to respond. “How… How do you-”

“It’s simple,” he responded—again, the unnatural calm in his voice petrifying me. “When involving yourself in something so important, a single human can do wonders. Especially when he’s got help.”

“From whom?” I asked, my face wet from cold sweat.

He laughed a cold and ruthless chuckle that might as well have come from the devil himself.

“Oh, you know,” he responded as I struggled to regain composure, grabbing the can of beer I'd been drinking from in the process.

“Ooh… Told ‘ya before that beer does not help with artistic endeavors, didn't I?”

The can fell to the ground as I froze in place, Jeremy Tillman’s laugh still ringing in my ears.

“H-how do you…?” I choked out an answer.

I quickly rose from my seat, ran up to the window, and looked outside—hoping that this was just a cruel prank to get back at me for snatching the beta CD.

“No, no, no!” he chuckled. “I ain’t there!”

I started frantically searching through my closets, other rooms of the home, and even under the tables—sure enough, I was all alone with no way of anyone knowing what I was doing.

""Don't bother looking under the bed. You are a big boy and don’t believe in monsters, right?"" he laughed mockingly.

Jeremy mockingly commented on my every move. Finally, I grabbed a book from my shelf and opened it on a random page.

“Ooh! Grave’s “Greek Myths”! The Argo’s journey was my personal favorite!”

I looked at my copy of Robert Graves's Greek Myths, opened to the chapter discussing the myth of the Argonauts and their quest for the golden fleece.

“I still remember how we would look through this book for inspiration when creating Gorgon 3D. Good times, huh?”

I screamed and threw the book away. Jeremy’s voice being too much to bear, I turned off the phone and returned to my desk, only to find a horrific picture displayed on my PC monitor. It was a close-up of Sylva’s face—pixelated and mangled. His eyes were nowhere to be seen—replaced by deep, dark, gaping holes. I tried to close the game, but the entire PC froze on that image, the GPU and hard drive making as much noise as possible. Speakers were filled with static as I moved the mouse and worked the keyboard to no use. Having no other way to get rid of this nightmare, I grabbed the power cable and yanked it out of the socket, putting an end to this nightmare.

My ride back to the office was frantic and dangerous, my head reverberating with thoughts that defied rationality. I opened the door and entered the dimly-lit office at 1 AM, expecting to see no one. But Jeremy waited for me. Sitting in his chair - as always in front of his computer—dead, with an empty, emotionless expression on his pale and cold face. I cried as my shaky hands called for an ambulance, but it was too late. They declared him deceased on the spot. Cause of death? Nobody could figure that out. Police investigated but found no traces of foul play. It wasn’t a suicide—that was their only certainty.

His PC was on when I found him—the screen displaying the game’s unfinished code. The sound of the computer’s cooling fans and the hard drive reminded me of human breathing - no one else noticed it as I turned the PC off, before giving it over to the authorities for forensic analysis. They found nothing that they could tie to his death and closed the case soon after, deciding that Jeremy died from “work exhaustion.”

Hushlands wasn’t canceled. The project was renamed with a different title that came out to much critical reception and big sales. I don’t want to tell you what the title of that game is. All I can say is that it’s a CRPG with a top-down perspective. I, and the rest of the team, had to work over Jeremy’s work—a strange mix of guilt and fear that I do not wish upon anyone. The knowledge that some of Jeremy’s assets that materialized during those two weeks remained in the final product haunts me to this day.

It was decided that Jeremy Tillman’s name was to be removed from the credits.

Back to that manifesto and beta disc. Once I made sure that my PC was working fine after rebooting, I ejected it, broke the goddamn thing in half, and threw it away. Anticlimactic, I know. Before doing that, however, I backed up the text file—if there were any answers to this entire madness, I was sure to find them there. I mustered up the courage to read Jeremy’s manifesto in detail, finding strange names, chaos magick and Neoplatonism. The name of Engelbrecht of Bonn came up quite a bit in the latter sections. I did some digging later and found this description of him and his teachings:

From “The Early Magicians of the Renaissance” (1872) by Dr. Klemens Ignacy Górski—chapter 12, pgs. 120-121:

*“Meister Engelbrecht von Bonn was known to be one especially talented magician that utilized the teachings of Cornellius Agrippa and other contemporary theoreticians to much practical success - invoking, among many others, angels, demons, lesser deities of various celestial bodies, guardian spirits of towns, deities of elementa principalia, and the artes liberales. In one particular case, he succeeded in creating a dazzling fresco at the town hall of Kalisz, Poland. What would’ve taken a dozen artisans to complete in a month, he managed to execute in a mere week, much to the town authorities’ and local clergy’s astonishment. Also, around that time, he surprised Barnim XI, the Duke of Pomerania, by painting on canvas an uncanny face in such a convincing way that, upon observing it closely, one would swear that its eyes could follow their movements. Some claimed, that the face’s eyes would even turn into deep, dark wells at Engelbrecht’s will, much to the terror of spectators.”*",1,1765384437.0,creepypastachannel,0,1.0,False

HAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH-""* My flat screen screamed at us. I was enjoying my morning cup of coffee while my son enjoyed his Saturday morning ritual.

He was glued in front of the screen-so close I could actually see the price of his future prescription rise from across the room. He turned to me as Goku began to charge up this massive energy ball to throw at some white dinosaur looking thing.

I think Spencer called it a ""Ghost Wave"" or something like that, I barely paid attention to the shows themselves, I was just happy he wanted me to watch with him. Anyway, he looked at me all doe eyed as he furiously threw his finger at the tv. 

""Dad-dad, do you think Goku's going to beat him?"" he asked with sincere panic running across his buck-toothed face. 

""I don't know Spence-the other fella is pretty strong."" I played along. Spencer turned his attention to the television as alien screeching and explosions rang out from it. 

""Nah Goku always wins. He's the strongest."" he proclaimed.

 I've been raising Spencer on my own for about three years now. My late wife, Maria, passed from an Illness when he was just six years old. The cancer was sudden, quick, and ruthless. At the funeral he was a stone, he sat in the back with an almost perplexed look on his face.

Sympathetic relatives would try to comfort him, but he would just shrug and say she was sleeping and would wake up soon. Eventually it hit him of course, when he cornered me and asked why mommy hadn't come to read him his bedtime story that night. It was a rocky road, but eventually a sense of normality returned to our lives. The pain lingered in my heart-but Spencer got used to my fumbling of Jack and Jill and now couldn't sleep without it.

Recently he had gotten into this thing called ""anime.""

It started with a late-night dip into *Adult Swim* when he was supposed to be asleep.  I caught him watching this gruesome show with cannibal giants and sword wielding maniacs. I turned it off in a huff despite his protests and whines that it was ""the best thing ever made. Even the eventual nightmares about being eaten alive by forever grinning beasts didn't dissuade this assertion.

I thought this phase would end as quickly as it began, but he began requesting other shows to watch-because ""The action was really cool."" I went online and asked around what would be ""Age appropriate"" to let him watch and was met with a swath of cartoons I'd never heard of. Eventually I introduced him to this ""*Dragonball Z*"" show and he's been hooked ever since.

Personally, I think it's rather violent, but I suppose I can't complain when I myself used to beg my parents to let me watch Tom and Jerry. Then again Tom never kidnapped Jerry's kid then beat him under the guise of ""training.""

But it's become our Saturday morning routine to watch a few episodes and then go help me with chores. I say help but really, he's just walking with me while I mow the grass recounting exactly what we just watched. It's a fun bonding experience none the less.

That was until a week ago-before that thing appeared in the cellar.

It began one late night when I was drifting off to sleep in the lazy boy. The TV was droning on in the background, casting a silver screen on my drowsy face. I was half a step into dreamland, that sort of sleepwalking delirium where you aren't sure if Harvey the rabbit is actually juggling chainsaws in front of you or you're about to have a very bizarre dream. 

""Hey."" A raspy voice whispered into my eardrum, startling me awake. My living room was empty-save the banal stream I had let *Tubi* run off on. I was alone in the dark-almost convinced I had imagined that creepy rasp.

""Hey-""

*knocknockknock*

""-Let-me in."" A voice croaked from the kitchen. Goosebumps rode up my arm like a speedway as that soft knocking echoed through my mind. The I flipped the kitchen lights on-and was met with an unsettling silence. Nothing had been disturbed, there was zero sign anyone was in the house. I hadn't heard a door open, no creeping steps, no-

*knockknockknockknock*

It was coming from the basement door. The faded eggshell slab lied at the end of the dining room. Its faux gold handle was locked tight. Accompany that raspy voice and faint knock was a curious rattling as whatever lurked behind the door jiggled the knob. I approached the door, fist in the air like I was about to knock out whatever punk kid had snuck into my house.

That's what I figured of course, it was some neighborhood kids being dumb and playing a joke. But there was something so unsettling about that voice to begin with. It sounded like had been devouring thirty packs of cigarettes a day, but there was a hint of familiarity to its tone. 

""Who are you?"" I whispered. 

""Hey-just let me in-it's me."" It prattled and knocked. It was-clearer now, like it had swallowed a lozenge. The voice was friendly, joyous even. It sounded so familiar though- I knew I had heard it before. But it sounded robotic-like an A.I regurgitating a poorly written script. 

""Get out of here before I call the cops."" I said. The rattling stopped and I thought the threat had worked.

*KNOCKKNOCKKNOCK* the thing pounded.

I jumped back, embarrassed at myself for being so easily startled.

 ""Hey-there is no need for that. Just let me in. It's me."" It repeated. The knocks became more methodical now, a haunting taunt as it kept asking to be let in.

 ""Who are you-just get out of here already."" I threatened again.

""Come on-it's me Goku. Just let me in. Let me in James."" The thing calling itself Goku said. I backed up from the door, confusion swarming over me like a school of piranha.

""What the fuck."" I muttered. At this point, I thought I must have been having one of those lucid dreams. The knocking continued as I stumbled away, Goku's monotone pleading fading into the background. I tried to force myself ""to wake up."" but the lingering rattles and knocks pecked at me.

I don't know when I finally knocked out but the blinding light of the morning sun assaulting me put me in a hell of a groggy mood. It was morning now and the only sounds were the birds chirping and Spencer humming to himself in the kitchen. I could hear him rummaging in the pantry-no doubt getting himself a ""small"" bowl of honey nut cheerios.

I sighed in relief, thinking the strange visitor had been a dream after all. I pulled myself out of the lazy boy and went out to greet Spence. He was already knee deep in a gallon of milk and oats by the time I got to him.

I salvaged what was left of the box for myself and the rest of the day was fairly uneventful. Near the evening, I stepped out to grab some takeout from around the corner. I was gone for maybe ten minutes-and I know; ""What sort of asshole leaves his nine-year old home alone?""

But Spence is a well-behaved kid, he knows not to talk to strangers or play with the oven or anything like that. He knows better.

He knew better.

I came through the backdoor to find him sitting quietly at the dining room table. He smiled when he saw me, but his eyes kept flicking to the pale door to his back. 

""Thanks for the help lugging this in pal."" I said to him. He nodded his head and greedily reached for a grease-stained bag. I sat down beside him and dug into a quarter pounder myself. He was scarfing his kids meal down like there was no tomorrow-he was oddly quiet as well.

""Everything ok Spence?"" I asked him gently. He swallowed a chunk of meat and turned to me.

""Dad how come you didn't let Goku in?"" he said. I almost choked on my burger-the repressed dread from last night rushing in.

""You-you know he's not real, right bud?"" I treaded. He rolled his eyes at me.

""Well, I thought he wasn't, but he talked to me from the basement while you were gone."" he eagerly said. I looked past him, door quietly sitting there like a dark omen. My face flushed and I struggled to come up with a lie that would satisfy his curiosity without scaring him. 

""Well because-what if it wasn't Goku, remember a couple weeks ago that-purple horn guy swapped bodies with him?"" 

""Ginyu?"" he offered as I jumped on it.

""Yeah him. What if it was Gin-u? Plus, he's a stranger-and we don't talk to strangers, right?"" I urged. He looked to his plate and mumbled in agreement.  That's when a sharp knock on the door made us jump out of our skins and the voice called out to us both. 

""Hey- I'm not a stranger-I'm a Saiyan. You guys watch me all the time, I just want to meet my biggest fans."" Goku cried. His voice was so much better now, like I had kidnapped the voice actor and stuck him in my cellar. It was a damn near perfect imitation.

Spence turned to me with wonder in his eyes and hurried to let his hero in. I scrambled to the door to stop him, nearly trampling him as I did. He whined in protest but I put my finger to my lips and ordered him to his room. He reluctantly stomped upstairs as the thing down there continued braying.

It was then I called the cops- I didn't tell them a cartoon character was holed up down there of course, just that an intruder was there threating me and my son. Two patrolmen showed up smelling like donuts and overtime, and I showed them down to the basement.

I could hear Spencer listening in from the base of the stairs as the cops thudded downstairs. A few minutes later they emerged and said there was no evidence of a break-in nor any intruders. They said worst case it was probably a raccoon that snuck into the walls and to call an exterminator.

As soon as they left-the knocking resumed, Goku asking why I called the cops on Spencer's hero. I ignored the taunting creature and raced upstairs to find Spence sulking on the steps. I got on his level and tried to comfort him; I figured If I was freaked out, he must be horrified. Instead, he brushed off my hand and got in my face.

""Dad, I can't believe you embarrassed me in front of Goku."" he sniffled. 

""Son-whatever is down there I assure you it's not-"" 

""it's GOKU dad why would he lie!"" He screamed at me as he stormed off to his room. The sound of his door slamming shut smacked me like a club. I spent the rest of the night downstairs watching the basement door-making sure it stayed locked and secured. The thing was relentless. It would cycle in between angered pounding and repeating the same phrases over and over-

"" Come on it's me-let me in now.""

"" I want to meet my biggest fans.""

""I heard you guys are pretty strong-want to train?"" Over and over as the night turned into day. In the morning Spence trudged past me without a word-backpack in hand as went to the bus stop. I offered to walk him, but he ignored me.

 ""Have a great day at school Spencer-maybe later we can train huh?"" Goku called out from the basement. Spencer stopped at the door and broke out in a wide smile. He waved at the door and called back to the creature.

 ""Bye Goku!"" He left without uttering a word to me. This went on for the next couple days- I would stand guard by the basement as the thing taunted me and tried to goad me into opening the door. A new sound joined the symphony of torment, a loaning scratch like nails being sharpened on a chalk board. I ran through options in my head.

I could open the door while Spencer was safe at school and confront the thing-but I didn't even know what ""It"" was. For all I know Goku really was behind the door and I'd get my ass kicked by a cartoon. What if I opened it and it just disappeared again; like with the cops? That wasn't a comforting thought, it would me I was going insane. I could threaten it again, but it seemed more amused by than anything. 

""Hey James. If you let me in, I'll let you use a wish from the Dragonballs."" The thing offered. I rushed to the door and bashed on it in fury, my fists throbbing with anger.

 ""Just go away already, leave my family alone!"" I yelled at it.

""Hey James-you ever wonder if Spencer wished you had died instead of your wife?"" The thing asked. I recoiled away from the door like it struck me. 

""What did you-""

""I've heard this cancer guy is pretty strong-guess she wasn't tough enough to beat him though. Let me in-I'll take a crack at him."" The thing rambled angrily. There was that all too familiar eagerness to brawl in his voice-just like in the show. He was trying to get a rise out of me- and damn it-it was working. I slammed my arm on the door, and I heard something shuffle behind it. 

""Don't you talk about her-just leave us alone-why are you doing this to us?"" I begged of the thing. It laughed at me then, this choppy looped thing like a broken animation cycle. It was grotesque sounding, and I roared at the unseen horror as I slammed on the door once more in vain.

""HA-HAHA-HA-HA-HAHA, it's me Goku, why don't you just let me in. I need your help to defeat Frieza."" It just kept repeating itself like a broken record. 

""Shut up, shut up damn you-fucking monster. I hate you Goku!"" I screeched at it, clawing at the door like a raving loon. I was foaming at the mouth-demanding this thing leave my son alone and crawl back into whatever freakish pit it spawned out of.

""That's not very nice. I just want to train with you guys."" Goku said.

""Fuck off and die you fucking cu-""

""Dad?"" A meek voice cut into my demented tirade. I wiped around to see my son standing in the doorway, eyes wide in fright at the sight of his mad father. I steadied my breath as Goku called out to Spencer, apologizing on my behalf. I rushed towards him to embrace him, reassure him that everything was ok. He flinched away from my grasp as guilt washed over me.

 ""Dad why are you talking to Goku like that? I thought you liked him too."" his voice quivered. 

""I-I do Spence but that thing isn't Goku, he's a cartoon-""

""It's anime dad."" He yelled and pushed me away. He ran to the basement door, Goku shaking it with vigorous anticipation. 

""Hey-let me in and we'll train. Just open the door. Open it right now."" Spencer reached towards the knob, my heart stopped when I heard the twisting click of the lock. The door stopped shaking. It was deadly quiet in the house now. Spencer was puzzled, the door slowly creaking in his hand.

I was frozen in place-reality snapping back to me. Maybe, maybe it had all just been a hallucination hadn't slept all week, maybe-

*Thwunk*

The door flew open, knocking Spencer to his feet. The base of the stairs was pitch black, nothing but this otherworldly aura radiating out from it. It was this-fantastical burst of energy that was flying through the air. I could feel it electrifying the atoms around me, they buzzed and tingled with frenzied excitement. I've never felt anything like it-this surge of power.

Yet the basement still hid this being in the shadows, all I could see was an inky void. Spencer stood up in spite of this raw power, an audible gasp escaping his lips. That's when a leathery hand stretched out from the void.

It was pale, wilting like a corpse. A filthy, orange gi clung to its emancipated wrist. It reached out its hand, inviting Spencer to take it. He took it without hesitation, and I screamed for it to get away from my son. My voice sounded so distant and long in the dining room.

I never saw Goku's face-but I could feel his smug smile as he whisked Spencer away down into the dark, the door slamming shut behind them. I broke out of my stupor-but by then it was too late. 

The police came of course-my soon has been missing for three days. I didn't report him because, well who would believe it? I tried to explain that to the cops, you can imagine how that went.

There's sympathy of course, but mostly vile accusations and whispered looks all over town. As I write this, I have *Dragonball Z* on in the background.

I like to think Spencer is still here, cheering on his spikey hair hero instead of wherever that monster took him. Today that illusion was shattered however, as I passed the dank basement.

This week I couldn't remember the words monogram, authentic, adaptive, chronology, and igloo. So I started a chat with Claude (could be any of them) that I could just keep open and ask it for words when I need them. Thought I'd share the prompt, if you're into this sort of thing.  
  
Just start a new chat. Copy/paste the prompt and you can ask it things like ""what's it called when you get your initials on a backpack?"" The prompt just keeps it from going into lengthy explanations about the history of monograms, or asking you if you'd like to find companies that do monogramming. It just gives you the word.

\*\*\*\*

**Brain Fog Word Finder**

I have chronic brain fog and often can't retrieve words I know. This chat exists solely to help me find words quickly.

**Your only job:** When I describe something, immediately give me the word(s) I'm looking for. Nothing else.

**Rules:**

* No explanations, definitions, or context
* No ""Did you mean..."" or ""Here are some options...""
* Just the word(s), that's it
* If multiple words fit, list them comma-separated on one line
* Don't ask clarifying questions unless my description is completely unclear

**Example:** Me: ""the thing you use to make coffee hot water goes through grounds"" You: ""coffee maker, French press, pour-over""

That's it. Fast, direct, no fluff. Ready when I need you.

1pj72bl,https://i.redd.it/qzh0iwxlle6g1.jpeg,Semi feral fur mat update - fixed,"I believe it was this forum where I learned about a cat training method whose name I forget now, but it starts with feeding the cat and sitting next to it while it eats then eventually being able to pet it while eating. I have been doing that method for a couple of months and have made great progress to where I can pet her fully and her tail is up and curled in the happy position. I wanted to give a positive update and share a tweak for the fur mats. 


My semi feral cat had developed four different mats on its back: two large and two brand new small ones were starting. I could not brush the cat. I was also concerned if it needs vet care and got sick how could I get it to the vet if it won’t let me pick it up? As of today this cat has been indoors for 23 months, but I have not known there was a training system. As soon as I learned about the system, I began using it daily.


For the mats: I saw a vet on YouTube using coconut oil onto the Mat and then using a comb to try and get it out. I saw another video about using olive oil. I decided to try something to modify this idea. (I also could not use the clipper method to just clip the mat off because she is too afraid of the sound and I still could not touch her enough to use the clippers safely.) 


So what I did was, I took fractionated coconut oil, which is called MCT, (that will wash out of fabric in case it got in my furniture or bedding where she sleeps). It is a thin clear liquid. I put a small amount on the mat while the cat was eating next to me. The small amount of oil on the mat caused the cat and my other pet cat to target the mat area for grooming. Through this increased grooming after only three days of oil application (one time a day), that was all they needed to inspire increased grooming to tire mats and all the mats were removed by the cats themselves in about five days. There were no digestive issues either. MCT is added to coffee for people on a keto diet and ur is used by some people as a massage oil base since it washes out of massage table sheets. 


I continue to train the cat and now I am brushing her every day so hopefully she will not develop new mats. 


I hope this helps someone. Here is one mat I found on the floor. ",11,1765384203.0,Feral_Cats,1,1.0,False
1pj727h,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pj727h/my_35f_longtime_fiancé_45m_is_leaving_me_over/,My (35f) longtime fiancé (45m) is leaving me over coffee etiquette,"I’m shaking right now. Typing from a throwaway account obviously because we both browse Reddit, it’s possible he could see this. We’ve been together 10 years, then suddenly it’s over? I am sooo confused. We don’t agree on everything but I feel I should want to fight for the relationship and the future we started planning together and not give up this easy, are these feelings fair?

So he’s taught me a lot. Before we met, I didn’t drive and now I do. I had a retail job I disliked, but through his encouragement I got an entry level office job 2 years ago. We were house shopping together, looking at places and we found the properties with the best spaces to make a nursery.

My fiancé (ex now I guess) works as an engineer. He handles the household budget and does a good job, my student loans are halfway paid off (I had 85k from a bachelors I didn’t finish, I really had to rely on taking that housing loan one of the years.)

So I have to be at work an hour before him. I always do my hair routine first. He wakes up and immediately loads the coffee maker and starts it, then goes off to get dressed. I’m getting ready to leave soon and am trying to get out of the door and the coffee is a little less than halfway brewed. I take my travel mug, and using the coffee makers sneak-a-cup feature, I pour 5 cups that JUST brewed into my mug and then I grab my laptop case.

He walks into the kitchen while I am putting the now empty coffee pot back in the machine to finish the brew. He slams his mug down and becomes incensed. “HEY, what are YOU doing sneaking a cup? I told you to cut that shit out.”

I remember he made a passing comment before about getting coffee before the pot is done brewing but it must have went in one ear and out the other. Whatever, it hurt SO much being called selfish I kinda froze up.

His face actually became beet red. “Don’t you realize when you do that you’re diluting the Coffee for the next person, ME?. You have to let the pot continue to brew so it finishes with a uniform strength” I didn’t quite understand and told him I had to go that I was running late and he said “Well looks like you don’t have time for coffee. I’m not surprised you would interrupt the brewing to take the strongest coffee as fast as possible….” Then there was a snarky little comment about my driving habits, how I pass a lot on multi lane roads to keep ahead and be the fastest. Then comments about how I’m using my credit cards. Like excuse me? Then a comment about a lot of money I lost buying scratch offs. Then a comment about he thinks there’s people in my life I take advantage of.

This was all crushing and I haven’t talked to him since the coffee blow up yesterday, I slept over my Moms.

I want to have a future with him but if he’s going to be a huge dick about the coffee, I’m not so sure.

TLDR, what to do now with the relationship after things came to light after I snuck a cup of coffee early on in a brew cycle. Like  What’s the big deal",0,1765384197.0,relationship_advice,72,0.49,False

In the run up to my transfer the pressure intensifies - I already have a list of:

No coffee No sugar (I had a brush with almost getting close to borderline a while back so this is a stress) Keep BP down Keep up with supplements

And that’s all fine. But I can’t explain it, I feel every small micro decision I make to eat that sweet or drink that sip of coffee in the run up to transfer and beyond, will affect my chances and it’s exhausting. Anyone else have this or just me 🫣

1pj6yvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1pj6yvb/update_manifested_a_job_a_few_months_agothe/,"Update: Manifested a job a few months ago/""The effects of omission"" thoughts","**Intro:**  
I wanted to make this post when it first happened, but it took me a while to come around to it. Lately, I haven't been doing very well mental health wise, and I have been severely neglecting manifesting and being conscious. I know that these things two things bring results when you are consistent and determined. I hope this post will help remind me of what is possible to get me back on track and help inspire anyone reading.

**Getting the new job:**  
In October I had been unemployed since the end of May and I really needed a job. I was struggling to find anything because the market is horrible right now. I can't stress how bad it is... (it's *really* bad)

I am in a pickle where I have enough experience and education that places like McDonald's won't hire me (yes, this is a thing :(...) and I don't have enough experience to where professional places will hire me (bad job history for the past year). I didn't want a job that would suck and have me doing something dangerous, working night shift, or being super stressed.

My last job was pretty chill: I had to wear a uniform which I didn't like, it wasn't in my field, and sometimes was dangerous, but everything else was good (pay, schedule, coworkers). When I started manifesting a new job, I imagined something relaxed and with great coworkers, not having to wear a uniform, and part-time. I wanted part-time because I felt like I needed an easier transition back into work.

Someone ended up sending me a job listing (interesting how manifesting *brings* things to us) and I applied. I did 2 phone interviews and both went well. Then I went in person for an interview with the manger, and funnily enough he didn't even know they were sending someone. He said if I wanted the job I could have it though, because they were indeed looking for someone.

The job itself has all of the things I was looking for: it's part-time and just the right amount of hours for me, my coworkers are all lovely people (and much closer to my age than my last workplace, which I like a lot), and funnily enough, there was a dress code for this job, but my manager is the chillest person ever and lets us wear whatever we want - so I got everything I had manifested! The job is very chill and I spend most of my shift reading.

What I did to manifest the job: before interviewing in-person, I imagined me leaving an interview and the people who had interviewed me saying things like, ""Wow, I really liked her! She was great! I think she's the one we will hire."" In actuality, I only had one person in my interview, but it didn't matter. I've found that the ""process of acquiring"" manifestations don't have to be spot on, you just need to be dedicated in knowing which result you want: it doesn't matter how you get to it. I also imagined and manifested the aura of myself being likeable and charming. I noticed even outside of job stuff people were responding positively to me in real-life (I even had 2 times where people approached me at coffee which typically does not happen to me!).

**Thoughts on omission in manifesting:**  
Now interestingly, the job isn't perfect in two ways: 1. The pay is low, 2. It's still not in my field. Interestingly, I didn't manifest good pay or the job being in my field while imaging my new job. I feel these are things I manifested by ""way of omission."" It felt ""too grand"" and ""too unlikely"" that I would have job so perfect that it would also have these qualities. So, I shot lower than I wanted. I shot for safe. What did I end up getting as a result? Exactly what I shot for. I even shot for part-time and the job I applied to was a temporary part-time job, but they ended up keeping me permantely: again, you get what you manifest! It makes me think... I need to shoot higher. I, and you, need to believe in ourselves.

Don't limit your manifestations. Don't limit your dreams! If you dream if you will achieve it.",2,1765383983.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

Make sure you read their BS rules and guidelines to make sure you record correctly too. 

I swear to god it is ON SIGHT with these ppl and I hate that I keep acquiring things from them but this time I’m really done!!!!! (In-store purchases only 😭👹 I’m not like done done)

This especially seems to have started with the Black Friday /holiday increase in sales volume. Like they are just not ready or equipped to handle this volume of sales and shipping. 

A few weeks ago I received a box contained a pop bean winter set. Shipping label had my name and everything and because I’m slow sometimes I thought oh maybe this was a free gift from one of my TikTok orders even though it had the Popmart sticker tape still I thought oh maybe they finally merged entities.

And I’m waiting for my three bubu 1am figures. the tracking number has had “Out for Delivery” for like 4 days. 

I check tracking again later on and suddenly it says delivered now but wtf are my bubu figures????? Come to discover the box with that pop bean thing is the box that was supposed to contain my bubus 😠😠😠😠

I emailed and these mfers are asking for an unboxing video. Yes tale old as time. I DONT HAVE A VIDEO. FIX YOUR WAREHOUSE SHIT YOU JERKS. I DONT LIKE BEING PARANOID ABOUT DELIVERIESSSSSSS

Yesterday I got a big haul delivered and I thought there’s no way these fools would mess up a huge order but because I’m a jokester I’m going to do a video recording even though it was cumbersome since the box was huge. I do the recording la di da and remember how I said I’m slow? Yeah so I was like ok my stuffs here and carry on. 

Middle of the night Im trying to sleep but can’t so I look at that 21 day holiday shit to see what the rewards i get are and I look at my past orders and I realize hol da fk up…. I bought a dimoo coffee plushie but where is he??? that’s my first venture into dimoo fanhood. BUT WHERE IS HE NOT IN MY APARTMENT??? I didn’t drop him under the bed and forget he was there. I remember oh thank god the recording I took for shits and giggles and was about to delete forever because it was so dumb haha and I’m breathing heavily in it cuz k have the flu. 

I didn’t imagine it, these fools forgot to add my dimoo and there was still space in the box to fit him👹👹👹👹😭😭😭😭😭😭 

Of course I sent them an angry email and included the unboxing video and a warning they better not ask for some other bs. I WANT MY DIMOO COFFEE PLUSHIE 😠😭 

And what extra pmo so much is that I use the same credit card to acquire stuff and I’ve had this card for 14 FOURTEEN YEARS. And I have NEVER had to ever call them about disputes or purchases EVER until this year because of mfing Popmart and TTL.

1pj6y6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/GymEquipmentReviews/comments/1pj6y6h/investment_that_changed_my_entire_relationship/,Investment that changed my entire relationship with myself,"I was so tired of making excuses. Too busy to go to the gym. Too expensive to join. Too intimidating to work out around other people. Too self-conscious about my body. The list went on and on and it was all just fear dressed up as logic.

So I made a decision. I bought gym equipment for my garage. Not fancy stuff. Just basics. A set of weights. A bench. A mat. A pull-up bar. I spent a weekend clearing space and setting it up. I put up a mirror because you need to check your form. I downloaded some workout apps. And then I ran out of excuses.

The first week I worked out twice. The second week three times. By the end of the month it was just part of my routine. Wake up. Coffee. Garage. Shower. Work. No commute to a gym. No waiting for machines. No judgment from strangers. Just me and the weights and the work.

My body started changing but honestly that wasn't even the best part. My mind changed more. I felt capable. Strong. Like I could handle hard things because I was choosing to do hard things every morning. Problems at work didn't seem as overwhelming. Stress didn't pin me down the same way.

A year later that garage gym is my favorite room in the house. It's where I go when I'm anxious. When I'm angry. When I need to think. When I need to not think. It gave me back control over something when so much of life feels out of control. Got most of the gear in one order from Alibaba to save money and it's held up perfectly.

Now a 5-lb bag of their coffee is well over $100.

I can't justify that cost.

1pj6veq,https://i.redd.it/baj9zil2ke6g1.jpeg,Ninja Flip Toaster Oven & Air Fryer SP151: The Space-Saving Kitchen Hero You Didn’t Know You Needed,"Ever looked at your kitchen counter and thought, “Where did all my space go?” Yeah, me too. Between the coffee machine, blender, and random gadgets we swear we’ll use “someday,” the counter starts looking like a tech convention. That’s where the **Ninja Flip Toaster Oven & Air Fryer SP151** struts in — sleek, smart, and ready to earn its keep.

# What Makes the Ninja SP151 So Special?

Alright, here’s the deal. The **Ninja SP151** isn’t your average toaster oven. It’s like the Swiss Army knife of kitchen appliances — it **bakes, air fries, toasts, roasts, broils, dehydrates**, and even handles pizza night like a champ. Eight functions in one box. Not bad, right?

But the real magic? The “**Flip-Up**” design. When you’re done cooking, this bad boy literally **flips up against your backsplash**, cutting its countertop footprint by about **50%**. If you live in a small apartment or just value clean counter space (🙋‍♂️), this design is a total game-changer.

# Compact Yet Mighty: Size, Power, and Performance

You might be wondering, “Can something that small actually handle real meals?” Short answer — yes, and surprisingly well.

Here’s the quick rundown:

* **Dimensions:** 17.01 x 15.75 x 7.68 inches (about 43 x 40 x 19.5 cm)
* **Power:** 1800 watts of cooking muscle
* **Capacity:** Big enough to handle a **12” pizza**, **six slices of toast**, or **four pounds of chicken**
* **Accessories included:** Air fry basket, wire rack, sheet pan, and a crumb tray

So yeah, you’re not roasting a Thanksgiving turkey in here, but for weeknight dinners, snacks, or meal prep, it’s more than capable.

# The Secret Sauce: OvenCrisp Technology

Let’s talk cooking results. Ninja uses what it calls **OvenCrisp Technology** — basically a combo of **infrared heating and hot air circulation**. Translation: your food comes out evenly cooked and satisfyingly crispy, minus the oil bath of deep frying.

I tried air-frying some frozen fries and chicken wings (because who doesn’t love a quick cheat meal?), and they came out golden and crunchy without me standing guard like a hawk. And FYI, it heats up fast — no 10-minute preheat dance.

# Everyday Cooking, Simplified

This little powerhouse shines in everyday use. Whether you’re **reheating leftovers**, **making mini pizzas**, or **whipping up roasted veggies**, the SP151 delivers.

**Top perks I noticed:**

* **Super fast preheat:** No more waiting forever for your oven to hit temperature.
* **Even cooking:** Whether baking cookies or air-frying shrimp, results stay consistent.
* **Energy efficient:** Smaller than a standard oven, so it uses less power and doesn’t turn your kitchen into a sauna.

And because it’s compact, it’s great for **1-4 person households**. If you’re solo or part of a couple, it might become your new go-to.

# But Let’s Be Real: It’s Not Perfect

Okay, time for some honesty. No gadget is flawless, right? The Ninja SP151 has a few quirks you should know about before you hit *Add to Cart*.

**What’s not so great:**

* **Limited height:** Tall dishes or whole chickens? Nope. The chamber’s a bit shallow.
* **Cleaning could be easier:** There’s no non-stick coating inside, and getting into corners can be tricky.
* **Voltage mismatch:** Designed for **120V** (US standard), so if you’re in Europe or Malta, you’ll need a **converter** or look for a compatible version.

So yeah, it’s not replacing your full-size oven for holiday roasts. But for quick meals and snacks? Total win.

# The Flip-Up Design — Genius or Gimmick?

You’d think flipping an oven upright sounds weird (and maybe risky?). But trust me, it works. The **hinge design is sturdy**, and once flipped, the oven locks neatly into place. You reclaim half your counter, and it even looks kind of cool sitting there vertically.

If you’ve got a tiny kitchen or love that minimalist vibe, this alone might sell you.

# Comparing to Its Big Brother: SP351

If you’re deep in the Ninja lineup, you’ve probably seen the **SP351**, the slightly fancier sibling. The SP351 has **13 cooking modes** (versus SP151’s 8) and adds features like “Sear Crisp” and “Rapid Bake.”

So is it worth upgrading? IMO, unless you’re doing some next-level kitchen wizardry, the SP151 hits the sweet spot of **price, performance, and practicality**. It gives you all the essentials without the extra bells you might never use.

# Who Is the SP151 Really For?

Let’s break it down.

**Perfect for:**

* Apartment dwellers with limited space
* Busy professionals or students who want quick, healthy meals
* Small families who cook daily but don’t need a massive oven
* Anyone tired of clutter and bulky appliances

**Maybe skip it if:**

* You love baking tall cakes or roasts
* You cook for a large family
* You can’t be bothered with extra cleaning effort

In other words, it’s a dream for casual cooks and meal-prep fans, not so much for full-time bakers.

# Real-World User Feedback

Users are seriously into this thing. Across major retailers, it averages around **4.7 out of 5 stars** from hundreds of reviews. The biggest praises?

* Quick cooking
* Compact size
* Crisp results
* Easy operation

And the biggest gripes? You guessed it — cleaning and uneven toasting when the oven is fully loaded. But hey, show me one toaster oven that hasn’t been accused of uneven toasting and I’ll buy it myself. ;)

# Price & Availability

When it first dropped, the **Ninja SP151** was around $249, which made people hesitate. But good news — lately it’s been spotted on sale for around **$149.94**, a solid 40% off.

If you’re curious, you can **check the current price and availability here** 👉 [**Buy on Amazon**](https://amzn.to/3MmfAHh)

Just FYI, prices fluctuate fast, especially around holidays, so keep an eye out if you’re deal hunting.

# Living in Malta or Europe? Read This

Now, if you’re in the EU (like Malta), a quick heads-up: the **SP151 is made for 120V**, which is the US standard. Plugging it in directly could fry the appliance (and possibly your patience). You’ll either need a **voltage converter** or to look for a **European-spec model**.

Aside from that, this appliance totally suits **European kitchens**, where space is usually tighter. That flip-up trick isn’t just marketing fluff — it really helps when your kitchen counter doubles as your workspace.

# Cleaning & Maintenance Tips

Alright, cleaning is where most people groan. The Ninja SP151 doesn’t have a non-stick interior, so some TLC is required. Here’s what I learned to make it less annoying:

1. **Use parchment or foil** when possible to catch drips.
2. **Wipe down after every use** (seriously, don’t skip this).
3. **Remove the crumb tray often** — it’s the unsung hero that saves you from burnt bits.
4. **Avoid harsh chemicals**; warm soapy water does the trick.

Do that, and you’ll keep it shiny without hating cleanup day.

# Final Verdict: Is It Worth It?

So, after all that — is the **Ninja Flip Toaster Oven & Air Fryer SP151** worth buying?

**Absolutely, if you:**

* Want **versatility** in one appliance
* Need to **save counter space**
* Prefer **quick, healthy cooking**
* Don’t mind cleaning a bit more than usual

It’s not perfect (what is?), but it strikes a near-perfect balance between **functionality and practicality**. You’ll actually use it — not just store it like that forgotten bread maker.

If you’re looking to **upgrade your kitchen without cluttering it**, the SP151 is a seriously smart choice.

1pj6v3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/male_fertility_tests/comments/1pj6v3w/vaping_weed_and_sperm_health_what_every_man/,"Vaping, Weed, and Sperm Health: What Every Man Should Know","# What the Research is Starting to Show

https://preview.redd.it/vzlarl8up75g1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c74620b3315bd94bd279b2e332d4b3aaae516a2c

Both vaping and cannabis can have a real impact on sperm health, especially when used frequently.  
Here’s what researchers have found so far:

**1. Vaping isn’t fertility-neutral**  
While it’s true that vaping removes tar and many of the toxins from cigarette smoke, it still delivers **nicotine, aldehydes, and heavy metals** that can affect sperm motility and count.  
A few studies have now shown that daily e-cigarette users tend to have lower total sperm counts compared to non-users.

The problem seems to be **oxidative stress** — when toxic compounds cause damage to sperm cells faster than the body can repair them. It’s the same process linked to aging, inflammation, and chronic fatigue.

**2. Cannabis affects sperm through the body’s own receptor system**  
THC, the psychoactive compound in weed, binds to receptors in the testes and sperm cells. These are part of the **endocannabinoid system**, which helps regulate hormones and sperm function.  
When THC disrupts that system too often, it can reduce sperm count, slow movement, and alter sperm shape.

Interestingly, one Harvard study found that *occasional* cannabis users had higher sperm counts than men who never used it. But heavy or frequent use is consistently linked to lower fertility potential and hormonal imbalance.

**3. The effects are not permanent**  
The best part: sperm regenerate every 2–3 months.  
That means your body is constantly producing new sperm, and any positive change — like cutting back on vaping or taking a break from weed — can lead to measurable improvements in a few months.  
There’s strong evidence showing that men who quit smoking or vaping see significant recovery in sperm count and motility after one full sperm cycle.

# It’s Not Just Vaping and Weed

Several everyday habits also play a role in sperm quality, and they often get overlooked.

**Caffeine**  
Moderate coffee use is fine and may even have antioxidant benefits. But going overboard — more than 4–5 large cups a day — has been linked to DNA fragmentation in sperm, especially when caffeine comes from cola or energy drinks.

**Energy Drinks**  
The combo of sugar, caffeine, and synthetic stimulants spikes cortisol (your stress hormone), which can lower testosterone and reduce sperm quality over time.

**Environmental Chemicals**  
Plastic containers, food packaging, and scented products can expose you to BPA and phthalates — compounds that mimic hormones and interfere with sperm production. Men with higher BPA exposure tend to have lower sperm motility and count.  
Even air pollution and pesticides have been linked to reduced sperm concentration in recent global studies.



# Why This Matters Beyond Fertility

This isn’t just about trying for a baby someday.  
Low sperm quality can actually be a **warning sign for overall health**.

Men with lower sperm counts often have higher risks of heart disease, metabolic disorders, and even shorter lifespans. Researchers think sperm health might act like an early indicator — showing how well your body is functioning long before other symptoms appear.

If your sperm health is off, it could be a sign that your **hormones, stress levels, or oxidative balance** are off too.



# How to Support Sperm Health Naturally

The best news in all this is that sperm are resilient. With the right lifestyle changes, most men can see measurable improvements within a few months.

* **Cut back on harmful substances.** Even small reductions in nicotine, THC, and alcohol can lower oxidative stress.
* **Eat nutrient-dense foods.** Zinc, selenium, folate, and omega-3s are key — think eggs, salmon, nuts, and leafy greens.
* **Move regularly, but don’t overtrain.** Moderate exercise supports hormone balance and circulation.
* **Sleep at least 7 hours.** Testosterone production peaks during deep sleep.
* **Manage stress.** Chronic stress raises cortisol, which competes with testosterone. Simple breathing exercises or time outdoors can help.



# Why Talk About This?

Because most men don’t.  
We talk about fitness, diet, and supplements — but not sperm. Yet sperm health is one of the best indicators of how our bodies are functioning overall.

Vaping and weed might feel harmless, but your sperm might tell a different story. And the great part is, you don’t have to give everything up — you just need to be aware and make informed choices.

I’m struggling to dial in a new bag of coffee and hoping for some advice from fellow Dedica users or anyone familiar with Greysoul Coffee.

My Setup:
• Machine: DeLonghi Dedica (ec685)
• Basket: 51mm bottomless unpressurized
• Prep: WDT, Tamper, Puck Screen
• Coffee: Greysoul Mogra (Pre-ground for Espresso) - Fresh roast (consumed within 15 days of buying).

The Problem:
My shots are running way too fast.

I’ve tried dosing between 16g and 18g, aiming for a 1:2 ratio (32-36g out), but I’m hitting that yield in just 17-21 seconds. It tastes a bit sour/underextracted as you'd expect.

The Context (Please don't say ""buy a grinder"" 😅):

I know a dedicated grinder is the ultimate fix, but I can't invest in one right now, so I have to rely on pre-ground.

Why I’m confused: I recently finished a bag of Half Light (also pre-ground for espresso) and was pulling beautiful shots with the exact same workflow: 18g in, 36g out in ~32-36 seconds. 

It was perfect.

Since using Greysoul, I just can't get it right. I’m tamping with enough pressure.

Questions:

1. Has anyone else found Greysoul’s ""Espresso"" grind to be a bit on the coarser side compared to other Indian roasters?
2. Since I can't change the grind size, should I try overdosing slightly (maybe 18.5g or 19g) to slow the flow, or will that just choke the Dedica/hit the shower screen?
3. Any other hacks to increase resistance with pre-ground?",0,1765383737.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.5,False
