# Background Information

**CAREER**

I'm currently an IT Support Specialist for a hospital here on the West Coast, California. I've been at this job for about 5 years. 2 years contracted, 3 years full-time. I have a pension (vests at 5 years FTE). Prior to that, I worked IT for GAP (yes, that one) for about 2 years. To summarize my time in this career, it's been absolutely braindead, I generally hate my job, but it's what I'm good at, so I stick with it out of a lot of fear I'll probably unpack little parts of in this post, and can elucidate on more if you ask. Anyway, the joke about IT support is that the only thing harder than getting into this career field is getting out of it. That couldn't be more true.

Personally, I'd like to go into content creation (Youtube, Twitch, etc). I actually have a lot of skillset that applies to it, but my biggest difficulty has been being consistent with it. I know I'm good at what I do because the 3 largest tries I've had with it all actually had really good footing, but I squandered those opportunities. It's ironic that the only thing I can convince my mind and body to be consistent with is the thing that I hate the most (I'm trying to see a Psychiatrist about this - feel free to ask).

In the meantime, I'm stuck resetting people's passwords, imaging laptops, and walking people through reading emails in their inbox like a first-grade teacher.

**HISTORY WITH JAPAN (Culture)**

1. Like most of you might expect, I was into anime and all of that when I was young. I specify 'young' because while I'm still a 'fan' of it now, I took put it out of my life for a period of time as I was in survival mode and I convinced myself that it was a waste of time. A little over a decade later, I got into a better (safer) position in life and rediscovered it. I definitely went through an emotional episode with it; rediscovering it like a lost love and regretting the time lost, but the reality is that the nagging in the back of my head still prevents me from fully indulging of it. So... still a fan, love everything about it, but I passively engage rather than actively. Hell, I've had a Crunchyroll subscription for the past 2 years and haven't watch an episode of anything in about 20 months. My extent of anime engagement is cons I go to and memes.

2. In my late teens, I was given a battle-scarred WW2 Japanese flag by my Grandmother as she was aware of my love for the culture. It was brought home by my great grandfather returning from the war. Never met him. No attachment to him. The flag, however, was an amazing thing to receive in my mind. Obviously, my younger obsession with Japan fueled all of this, but also... it's a flag. It's cool, ya know? I got it framed at some point, and it's been framed ever since. I recall, shortly after receiving it, having a youthful fleeting thought that I'd like to take it back to it's home one day, returning it in honor to it's country and the annals of it's history. As I've gotten older, especially in the last 2 years, this feeling has grown stronger, and I do have a very strong emotional urge to bring it back home. The politics surrounding the time period aren't important, all I know is that while the flag was given to me, it does not belong to me.

3. Similar to the flag, there is also a Wakizashi taken from the war as well that I'd like to return to the family, should I ever be able to find them. Same fleeting thought when I was young, and same stronger urge now that I'm older.

4. I've always loved and appreciated Japanese culture as a whole - respect for the ways of life, architecture, agriculture, traditions, customs, speech pathologies, etc. While I'm not some studied scholar of the country, I know my fair bit about the country; I'd argue more than most on this path that I'm on.

5. I studied Japanese for 2 years in high school. Would have been 4 years were it not for an... unhealthy, unsupportive, and racist environment I was in, but I didn't take those two years I did get for granted. Sufficed to say, aside from Katakana and Hiragana, I have no linguistic knowledge anymore and it's something I intend on changing, regardless of my future with Japan itself.

As a summary of my history with the country; while I've always appreciated and respected it, and despite my desires to return icons of it's history home, I've never had a tangible thought that I WOULD ever actually make it to Japan. I never made plans or dreamed big about it while young and on top of that, I've never had much wanderlust to begin with. I've never traveled, so maybe there's an unfound itch there that has yet to crop up, but otherwise the desire to go outside of my walls has never been there.

**FISCALS**

I currently make $77,000 a year.

I can get knee-deep into the numbers because I love this stuff but I'm going to try and reel myself in here and just summarize the fact that were I to liquidate everything I have tomorrow and pay off my remaining debts, I'd have about $45,000 cash. I'll be covering this more later.

# Rationale

So I bet you're thinking after the uncomfortably-detailed background above, you're expecting some big emotional post to rationalize the idea. Well, you are correct. Buckle your ass.

I kid... kinda. Brass tacks. Good luck!

I stumbled upon a video in July about opportunities opening in the IT field in Japan - namely in the Cloud Computing sector. While I myself don't have cloud computing knowledge (which obviously could always change), there seems to be a lot of openings for Data Center Technicians looking for English speakers. For those not in the know, this isn't a particularly glamorous job. You could consider it the plumbing of IT. No disrespect to the work itself whatsoever, but compared to my experience, skill set, and current job, it's entry level and considerably more blue-collar than white-collar; less cushy than what I have. In any case, it's absolutely a way into Japan that isn't the JET program because you couldn't put me in that field if my life depended on it (and to a degree, it could kinda be argued that my life does depend on it). I've heard plenty of horror stories about the general treatment that Western English teachers get in that country, and I know I'd just get chewed up and spat out. I give all the credit in the world to the teaching industry as a whole. All teachers everywhere are criminally unappreciated, especially here in the US.

**=======CONTEXT=======WARNING=======CONTEXT=======**

I've gone through a significant life change in the last 6 years. The story is chock full of detail that would warrant it's own separate post, so I'll spare the details (snort) unless asked or if something feels relevant. Here are the important pieces that I feel I see other posters get asked about the most.

**CAREER**

I desperately hate my job and my field. I've had thousands of hours of conversations and internal dialogue about this. I promise you that, at least in regards to my field and my day-to-day, there's nothing you can say or advice you can give me (related to my current job) that will get rid of this feeling. If you feel compelled to provide advice, I'll trust your intentions are good but I ask that you spare yourself the time and not bother with that part. While there are absolutely drawbacks to my field and the role I'm in (and a plethora of positives I'm fully aware of), I have actually come to a conclusion.

Where I'm at in life right now, with the things I've experienced, the failures I've accumulated (personal, not fiscal), and the opportunities after opportunities after opportunities that I've missed (primarily out of over-analysis), I have basically reached a point where I **cannot** see a future for myself in this country - not, ""*I'm not sure where I'm headed*"" or ""*I'm going through a rough patch*"" - no. I physically cannot conjure an image in my head of what my future looks like in this country, and I will happily provide specifics on that (not gonna leave you hangin').

**RELATIONSHIPS**

* **Partner**

I'll start with partner prospects. Again - trying to avoid politics - but I think a lot of people can agree that the dating market in the West isn't the best. It's not some hyperbolic dystopian gray-world (not yet, anyway), but it is VERY difficult to not only trust people in this country, but go through the song and dance commonly associated with Western dating. Before you judge me too hard, please hear out my reasoning why this is problematic for me because it's probably not what you're assuming.

Like a lot of young people, I - for the longest time - believed that the biggest thing holding me back from PERSONAL progress in the future in this country was gas and grocery prices and that my wage was too low. Any modicum of studying macro econ will show that that's not really the case. Once my debts were cleared (car, really - no credit cards or payday loans or any of that nonsense), it was like magic - I had money to save every month. Shocker. Despite having this extra money, I very quickly realized that I hit a hard ceiling. All the tertiary issues in my life are solved - I have good health, I have money in the bank, I'm not looking at food or gas prices, and I have a peaceful apartment... but I'm not exactly 100% fiscally comfortable. I'm already 32 and I'm kinda at the end of my career path (IT Support; not where I wanna be, but it's what I have for now and $77,000 is not bad money whatsoever), I live very frugally and while the money I save every month isn't awful, I'm ain't making any moves any time soon, at least in this country, and the only way that really changes is with a partner.

To be clear, this isn't the only (or even the primary) reason why I want a partner. I've been treated horribly by partners in the past and left to eat dust with a bloodied heart in my hand too many times (cheated on every time). As a result, I kinda stopped trying to look hard and just focus on building myself. Speaking from a health-mindset, that was 100% the correct choice. I've still wanted a partner though. That's normal, isn't it - wanting to share life with someone? Believe me, I love my solitude, but 4 years is a bit... yeesh. In any case, I'm still faced with this dilemma. With everything kinda stable in my life now, isn't this is the part of the cute story where the guy unsuspectedly stumbles into the quirky girl at a bakery with tons of bokeh in the background and bystanders in the foreground somehow having completely silent conversations as not to disturb the main character's dialogue? That was a joke, btw. Well, it isn't for lack of trying, but that just hasn't been the case for me, and I work VERY strange hours that aren't really conducive to meeting people. I've made attempts to put myself out there in terms of putting myself in situations where I could meet someone with similar interests. I go to an arcade every Sunday and I try to go to cons near me when they pop up. I'm not a drinker, so I'm certainly not gonna bar crawl, and I was never into the club scene. This boils back down to what I believe to just be a culmination of issues with dating in the West, and don't get me started on dating apps.

* **Friends**

As anyone might expect: the older you get, the harder it is to make friends. I always prided myself on making friends when I was younger because I was very good at it, however on reflection, I think I was so good at it because it was a combination of my absurdly good conversational skills and opportunities to meet people (primarily school). I reckon this is what all the 30 year-olds in my teenage life meant when they said enjoy it while it lasts because... I'm just not in frequent enough close proximity to anyone to form a bond, and all the people at my job are men in their late 30s and early 40s with families. I always try to engage with people when I go out, but people are usually in their little cliques. I've had a few engagements since I started going to the arcade, and they were super fun, but I wasn't able to get numbers or anything. It just seems like unless the friend group is a surviving group from their school life, most people just aren't wanting to expand their friend group in the West.

**HOUSING**

This is where the conversations naturally went to first when I first started floating this idea of moving to Japan a few months back., I'll make this one brief because it's boring. Apartments are expensive in the states you'd expect them to be in. So why not just move states? Because nothing really changes. The home becomes cheaper, the utilities go up, and the wage goes down. It's the same situation but with lower numbers. I have no attachment to anything here in California, but I've done extensive research, job hunting, and apartment hunting in other states and it's exactly like I say - cost of living is, on the whole, cheaper but my wage goes down to reflect that.

I've done this research for years prior to making this choice, and no option is the reasonable one to make especially considering that I have a stable career here in California that doesn't permit me to go remote out of state AND my apartment, while still expensive, is very cheap compared to my surrounding area (by like... $400, even for apartments attached to me) while also being in a safe area This is usually where I cap off this conversation by saying that sacrificing comfort and security should not be the default in the housing market, and that would be the sacrifice I'm making at this point because there is no other tangible benefit. In regards to percentage of my wage, this is the best price I'm going to get for the amount of security I have. It's not even a gated community - it's just a safe(er) neighborhood relative to what's around me. All this without even starting the conversation of moving cost itself. SEGWAY!

**RECREATION

Cat out of the bag: I'm a gamer. I self-isolate a majority of my day (also thanks to my job), and I'm generally pretty content in this solitude. However, as life has stabilized more for me, I've been trying more and more to incorporate things that expands life's palette. Look, I don't live in LA or New York or anything. I live in a pretty suburban area. There's a mall, some staple retail stores, and that's about it. I don't have much to do. In November of 2023, I started a habit of going to the arcade every Sunday. This doesn't sound like much, but it did a lot for me. It got me out of the house, it's something I enjoy doing, it puts me around other people, and it presents me with a weekly opportunity to socialize beyond my friends on Discord. I pay $10 for 1:30 hours of arcade time, and I play Initial D the whole time and try to interact with other racers. However, when this time is up, it's back to my normal... which is to say not much. I'll walk around the mall and maybe visit the DAISO store, but that's where it ends. I'd like to be encouraged to walk about more, but aside from a corner coffee shop, there's nothing tangibly unique about my area to visit, and the Mall itself is a bit out of comfortable walking range.

There are no parks. There are no hobby stores. There are no unique eateries. While my neighborhood and home provide me security, I can't deny that I'm isolated beyond my control (for the reasons listed in the housing section), and this frustrates me.

**COMMUNITY**

This is a pretty crucial one to me and actually kinda encompasses the items above. I mentioned that I have no real attachment to California. Well, the line isn't drawn there. I have a lot of difficulty attaching to my country and the culture as a whole. When wanting to stretch my social chops a bit, I'm not often met with eagerness to engage. I understand the irony of this topic considering that America is very well known for strangers being totally willing to go up to each other and speak. However, it is also known that America tends to have an ego-centric culture, so while it's very common to see people being friendly to each other, it's very rarely an at-a-whim thing with no strings attached. This doesn't inherently mean that the encounters are negative or have malicious intentions, but the motives are skewed and it's very difficult to determine someone's intent, even in a contextualized situation like helping someone.

I understand the double-irony of saying this considering the place I'm asking about moving to being Japan where honne and tatamae exists. This is a concept that exists in just about every country. I'm very familiar with it, and as someone who has a pretty strong grasp of the 5-tiered ladder of social awareness (something I love talking about), it's something I can understand. The key difference between Japan and the West is that Japan's hiding of true feelings is out of respect of the conversation and reducing social awkwardness and putting stress on the other individual to capitulate the subject. In the West, true feelings are typically hidden to avoid confrontation or out of fear of being taken advantage of, which is totally a reasonable concern, by the way. The problem that comes with this in the West, however, is that when that's the default, no communication happens at all or worse yet, communication DOES happen but it's laced with lies to misdirect. At least in Japan, everyone has the common understanding of not wanting to make things awkward (despite it kinda... diluting conversation down to almost nothing). Everyone seems to assume friendly intent, but in America, everyone assumes malice.

The proclivity of Americans to engage in random friendly conversation tends to be out of a desire to not drown in silence when sometimes silence might be the better option. But this is obviously the difference between a homogenous monoculture like Japan, and a mixed culture like America. The way I've summed it up in conversations in the past is that the issue America has with communication makes it feel like your neighbor, who is only 20 feet away, might as well be on the other side of the country as far as your relation to them is concerned. Americans isolate just like the city-bound Japanese do, but they do it out of fear and discomfort whereas the Japanese seem to do it out of contentment and convenience. As an aside, there's a very good stand-up comedy bit about this pertaining to answering the doorbell in America in the modern day compared to the 20th century.

#General Plan

This is hopefully the part where I display my competency and try to make an appeal to you, my internet peers, that I'm not going into this idea halfcocked and this decision making process hasn't been just... on a whim.

* Ideal Timeframe

My ideal timeframe from start to finish would be within a year, or by the end of 2025. Now, just to preface; I'm SUPER susceptible to the hyper-fixation problem of 'preparing to prepare' - constantly researching the perfect strategy to do something, but never doing anything with it. A big symptom of this is saying something like ""*Okay, I'm gonna do all this research and start doing things on 'X' date*"". This, for most people, is usually bad because it sets a barometer of failure. I'm the same way. However, since July, I have already enacted on getting things in order without having done the most important parts yet.

* Health

When I came to this conviction in July, the first thing I thought of was my health. I've had health insurance for the last 3 years and haven't used a lick of it - a portion of it out of fear of the process, but primarily out of laziness, I'll admit. Anyway, my goal was to get all my health stuff done by the end of the year. Why is this relevant? I'm a big dude, I really shouldn't be, and Japan has a lot of walking. In retrospect, my health should have been a consideration of mine before the Japan decision, but that's neither here nor there at this point. If you are interested though, I'm pretty much completely healthy, just overweight and my doc thinks it might have something to do with my sleep. I have a long history of insomnia since I was a kid, and I currently work a swing shift that doesn't see me going to bed until about 6am. You be the judge. I digress. I don't want to be a strain on the Japanese system. I know me as an individual won't have a large affect on the system, but I don't want to bring my problems that I should have handled myself to another country, so it only seemed appropriate.

==========**PLAN ONE**==========

* Learning

Starting in 2025, I plan on going on a 'College' schedule in terms of daily activity. I plan on trying to do 1 hour of Japanese study a day with the goal of working up to 2 or 3, I plan on going to the gym to improve the quality of my flesh prison, and lastly, I plan on using my recently acquired organizational license to Udemy Business Pro to take some tertiary courses to the field I'm trying to get into in Japan to both improve my skills and to improve my prospects of getting hired.

* Scouting Trip

I've never been to Japan, and while I'm very good at compartmentalizing foreign concepts in my head, I understand it would irresponsible of me to just uplift my life and go somewhere I've never been before. With that said, I'd probably plan for a one or two week trip in March. My goal with this trip would primarily be to engage with the public transit system and tour the locations I'd be trying to get hired at.

* Fiscals

I plan on selling everything except my computer and my art. My pension will cash out because it's not vested. I intend on using about $10,000 to plant roots in Japan, and the remaining $40,000-ish would be left here in American accrual systems. From there, I would use whatever I make from my new job to support my life in Japan. I plan on seeing a investment lawyer about this so I can see what options will be available to me and how this will play out while living in a different country.


==========**PLAN TWO**==========

* Learning

Similar to plan one, I'd start studying Japanese immediately while I still remain on US soil, but plan two would instead see me go to Japan, as soon as possible, as a language student for 6 months to a year depending on...

* Fiscals

I was only made aware of this path very recently. It just wasn't something I considered at all because leaving a job to go jobless for anything longer than 3 days as a 32 year old man scares me. From very brief research into tuition, I'd be planning on $20,000 to $30,000 for a year, and that scares me. That could be an over estimate or an under estimate. My research on this plan is very underdeveloped right now. And naturally, as a consequence of a more accelerated plan like this, I'm unsure about the prospects of a...

*Scouting Trip

Considering the cost it would be to board in Japan as a student, I don't know if I could afford a preliminary scouting trip. While the obvious point of the language school route naturally teaching me about Japan and providing me opportunity to scout applies here, the downside is that if that's my purpose, then it becomes a $20,000-$30,000 scouting trip if I end up not liking it (which I can't imagine being the case) instead of a few thousand dollars instead.

As a side note, if anyone has information on it, I'd be interested in hearing opinions on going to the country as a student for a year to learn Japanese before getting into the work force. I've heard this is the best 'naturalization' path and tends to ease people into the experience.

#FINAL SUMMATION AND RATIONALE BEFORE YOU RESPOND

Having this be a separate section is necessary because with all of the previous context in mind, I can provide you the culmination of my rationale. Let's review and address some things you're probably thinking about.

1. **Career & Plan 1:** I am fully aware of the dangers of leaving a relatively stable career. It's something I've juggled a lot in this thought process because, for me specifically, I have been a slave to the fear around my job, and it has caused me to stagnate. I fully understand I'd be making less and that work culture in Japan is significantly different. To that, the only thing I can say is that I'd be working for a Western-styled company (FAANG's) and there's a chance I can retain some of the culture that makes work life relatively bearable in this states.

2. **Partner:** I am fully aware that I'm not going to suddenly fall into a relationship when I walk off the plane. I am also fully aware of the issues with relationships in that country. It's something I've been fascinated with and something I've looked into a lot, even previously to this decision, because it has a lot to do with human sociability and it's just... a cool (but sad) topic to learn about. In any case, I still want to apply myself when getting into any relationship. I'm not expecting some quick turnaround.

3. **Friends & Community: ** I am fully aware that I'm not suddenly going to have a satisfying amount of friends when I walk off the plane. Not only are the big cities in Japan some of the most socially isolated, but that honne and tatamae is taken to the Nth degree compared to Rural Japan. Moving to Japan will not suddenly fix all of my social issues that I encounter with making new friends, in fact, I will likely encounter new ones.

4. **Housing:** I am fully aware that my argument for housing seems pretty much the same when considering Japan - cheaper cost of living and my wage goes down, so how is Japan any different than my argument for not moving to other states? Necessity of a car.

So, with me acknowledging the above problems; what's my angle? What's my big rationale?

# **Paradigm Shift**

Soapbox time!

As I said earlier in the post in the career section, I cannot see my future in this country. I can't even imagine a figment, but it's because it's more than just my job causing that.

In a vacuum one or two of the issues I brought up could be reasonably addressed at once. It'd be exhausting and a hard fought conclusion, but it could probably be done. As of right now, however, and for the foreseeable future, I have no feasible recourse to resolve all of these issues. If you want the yucky answer to my own introspection, the most immediate thing that could help start alleviating my issues is a partner because having a partner would free up both money and time.

As of right now, here is my situation: IT in the West is undergoing a very tumultuous shift. A lot of the COVID hires are starting to be let go because companies are realizing they over-hired. With the worst behind us, they can reduce those costs and they actively are. In my job, a hospital IT support line, despite us losing 6 people within the last year alone, we've only replaced 2 and don't intend on hiring more. Everyone is strained as a result, and we're all death-gripping our positions right now; not because we're at risk of losing them, but because they're very hard to acquire. As a result, I can't really explore getting out of this awful sect of IT into maybe something else. I've researched this. My own organization doesn't have open positions in other departments. Leaving for another job in the **Western** market specifically is a gamble.

Because I'm stuck in this current position, I'm locked into strange hours. The cruel irony of these swing shift hours, however, is that they fixed my horrible sleep issues that had gone resolved for 25 years until I got this shift 3 years ago. Years of medical intervention did nothing. Who figured a shift change would be so drastic? To the point, however, I'm unable to mingle with the normal masses except on my days off - for both friend and partner prospects. Even with those days off, there isn't actually much recreation to do here. I'm exceptionally limited.

So, naturally, the last thing I considered was moving... except for the issue I mentioned with the market previously **plus** the cost of moving with no guarantee of any difference. It's throwing away money.

So how does Japan solve all of these things? Well, it doesn't... not of the rip, anyway. To hopefully convince you that I'm not under some delusion, let me spell it out for the people in the back:

# **Japan will not solve my problems. I'm merely swapping one set of problems for another.**

Japan is not the land of milk and honey. It's not some uwu anime paradise. It's not some place for foreigners with main-character syndrome to go live out fantasies. It's a complex place with it's own complex culture and complex issues. On the world stage, however, it's a place that I've observed take more tangible steps towards solving it's own problems than I have other countries, including my own. It's solutions aren't perfect, and more issues arise every day than it likely solves every day. However, I have more confidence in my ability to thrive in a culture built on respect for the minds, spoken words, and spaces of it's neighbors.

Sure, are there some sappy reasons I repeat in my head why I want to go despite what others in this thread might say? Absolutely. I'm not shy about it.

* I want to be apart of something greater, and it seems like the Japanese, for all the faults the country may have, are at least eager to try and keep it afloat (no pun intended).
* Yeah, it is kinda the birthplace of the pop culture that defined my teenage life. I think it'd be cool to indulge in that a little after putting it off for so long.
* I think there's something modest about the country's desire to be business-centric and encourage and maintain walkable cities. I'd like to be a part of that vision.

I could name more, but the thing ultimately pushing me to this idea **NOW** at the age of 32 despite it never having done so before, even when I was arguably more active in consuming Japan's culture in the past, is that I'm in a place where I want to make a change in life, I **CAN** make a change in life, and I catch myself reminiscing on the times I can count on two sets of hands that I bypassed opportunities to make a jump. I've come to terms that a lot of the opportunities I missed, I can no longer capitalize on. I've put those to bed. However, I want to believe that I'm more cognizant of my position in life now than I've ever been, and that there's a reason why my finger failed clicking off the video giving me this idea in the first 8 seconds like it was prepared to do.

I'm not spiritual. I don't believe in fate or destiny. But I'd be a damn liar if I said the signs I've been receiving since watching that video weren't making me quirk an eyebrow, and I have received many. With my life history, I'm someone that should be easily susceptive to cognitive bias, but I'm either dense or blind because If I wasn't seeing signs before, I sure am now.

#But...

I leave my decision in your trusty hands, /r/movingtojapan.

I've done hundreds of hours of research, but the only real answer I can get is from people who know.

So, with that said, here are my main...

#Questions!

1. My main question is if this does end up being a reasonable choice to make, is plan one or plan two ideal?

Plan one secures employment immediately, but as a result of jumping from one corporate culture to the next, you're likely not going to be afforded a lot of integration time in the first few months as you adjust, and I've heard this is very rough period because it's breakneck.

The arguments I've heard for plan two is that for those wishing to naturalize more quickly, going into school is the best route because you're more or less setup to crash into other students and natives allowing you to not only learn the language quicker, but have easier access to the inner culture of Japan and taking your first steps. This is obviously the more costly option, however.

2. Am I lost in the sauce, and have you heard of stories similar to mine? Failures or successes?",0,1735699693.0,movingtojapan,1,0.5,False

It NYE and I am a single, late 30s guy posting on r4r. I am clearly the coooooooolest and eveyone wants to hang out with me! No. I am not celebrating the New Years with frozen pizza…..

Let’s get some things out of the way. I am an atheist. I don’t want kids or to be a step dad.  I am fairly left leaning. I am not a communist or socialist, but I’ve been called it. I am a very bad texter. I often text back in between activities so I tend to be brief. I am more of a voice chatter.

So let’s get to it. I am single. I would like to unsingle. This is reddit and I don’t think this will happen here. However. Nice fun conversation is something that could happen. That’s great. 

I am tragically boring and mediocre person. I know I am suppose to sell myself on how cool I am but……….. I’m not. [Insert Giggles] You know what, I am damn proud of it. Took me a lot of work to get my 3.0 at a mid tier college so I can work my regular job at my cube farm. Not everyone, can be as cool as Elon. Joking. I am joking. I have played DnD, not joking. I often un-ironically think, “I am too old for this.” I even own one of those daily pill organizers. I swear I am 39. I checked. I am bad at math, but I am not THAT BAD at math. I hope. I am guilty of being a typical millennial male in which I have done these things in a cringe way; done stand up comedy, played in a metal band, thought I was cool for being a gamer and many more. Just ask! I don’t care much for sushi and I dislike IPAs. Look, I don’t hate sushi, I’ll go and I’ll be happy. I never crave it and would choose to just go get a sandwich. I do like my lightly roasted coffees though. Oh goddammit. I am DRINKING a light roast brew as I write this. I am a ham burger enthusiast. I have never seen Breaking Bad or the Wire.

Currently my life is busy. I work and I am a bit of a workaholic at the moment because I am trying to make changes, and advances to my current career. Maybe even a career change. I am also trying to change my living situation. So a lot of my energy is directed at be productive. I am not a die -hard workaholic in which this is my complete lifestyle. I am just trying to make changes. However. I do like to “work” at things. I get deep into hobbies and subjects. I am investing heavily into my health by working out regularly and eating better. I am really looking to increasing my physical activity. I feel as I age, fitness is more critical.  All I want for my future, at this moment, is to work at a job I enjoy, and to be healthy. Yes. My schedule is stacked. I do want to and like to, take time from being productive to spend time with friends and to do fun things. 

What are fun things I like doing? As I hope to draw this workaholic phase to a close soon I would like to start a Punk Rock band, establish a marijuana farm and spend more time at the climbing gym. I am totally lying. I am not that cool. I used to spend a lot of time at galleries and museums when I was in college and I really miss doing so. I feel very fortunate to live on the west coast and I should go out and experience more for this region. I would really like to get more politically involved. I participate in election canvassing this past election and I feel like need to do so again and participate in a greater degree. I want to get into the performing arts. I want be in a play at least once. I am embarrassingly under-read and I want to read more. 

Lets hit the controversial malarkey. Atheist. Very atheist. I never lost the faith, because I never had it to begin with. I am  not spiritual either. I don’t even know what it means to be spiritual. Politically, I really care about the environment, infrastructure, limiting the power and influence of the rich, and education. I don’t think Elon is or was cool. Not wanting to be a parent is pretty self explanatory?  You don’t have to aligned with me on these ideas. I am pretty open and accepting. I just want to put it out there for those who find this important. 

What am I looking for here? Conversation would be a nice start, especially over voice chats. See my bad texter comment. If you ever hang out with me I promise to bake you cookies.",1,1735699508.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I enjoy knowing people from all walks of life and learning about new perspectives over a variety of topics. We can chat about the state of the world, life goals, hot takes, anything really.

A bit about me:

I work in tech and code a bit outside of work as a hobby. I play 2 instruments and love classical music/music theory. I like dabbling in stuff like arts and crafts, creative writing, DnD, baking cookies, and traveling. I drink tea, wear sweaters, and have a cat on my lap so my aesthetic is grandma-core

additional hobbies: having existential thoughts, pacing around my room, fixating on fictional universes and hypothetical scenarios, doomscrolling reddit, drinking caffeinated beverages like coffee and tea, oversharing

I'm a generally ambitious person so people who obsess over their life goals and the future like I do we may get along ",0,1735699489.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,0.5,False
1hqu0an,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/1hqu0an/costco_wrapped_year_two_at_the_food_court/,Costco Wrapped - Year Two at the Food Court,"My wife and I were wondering how often do we get a Costco Food Court number that we have had before but have no idea so the past two years I decided to collect the data and here are the results for year two!

Link for Year 1 Results: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/18yvxgq/costco\_wrapped\_a\_year\_at\_the\_food\_court/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/18yvxgq/costco_wrapped_a_year_at_the_food_court/)

In the time between 1/1/2024 to 12/31/2024 we went to Costco Food Court 140 times, on average returning every 2.66 days. (Up from last years 2.77). In that time, we received 12 duplicate numbers: 124, 152, 251, 305, 378, 492, 588, 625, 659, 755, 916, and 973. We got our first duplicate of the year (152) on March 7th. The quickest time between getting a number for the first time and having the duplicate was only four days after when we got 305 for the first time March 12th and four days later got it again. The longest period between duplicates was 251 which we first received on January 24th but didn’t see again until December 4th, a whole 315 days later. Our final duplicate of the year was 973 on December 13th which is also the highest number we got this year. Most importantly 916 has the honor of being the only number we received three different times this year, 1/28,  4/21, and 6/2!

We had three runs of three numbers: 669, 670, 671, 672, 350, 351, 352, and lastly 001, 002, and 003. In our hunt for number 1 it took us 637 days going all the way back to last year before we were finally able to get it. Costco officially labelled us their #1 customer! It was a total accident and our order was a coffee and two cookies.

Now you may be thinking, that is way too much Costco and we are aware. We visited a Costco on 38% of the days of the year and going that often we still only received 12.8% of the possible (999) numbers. Counting the numbers we got last year we have only seen 23% of all possible order numbers. The longest we went without going to a Costco is 8 days. Even when we go on vacation we typically stop in for gas and to use their clean bathrooms. We visited 5 different Costcos this year on our travels including Juneau, Alaska the smallest Costco in the world. Unfortunately they don't give numbers there but it was still really fun to visit! Many of these travel days also turned into what we called double Costco days. (morning coffees, and lunch or dinner later) We ordered from the food court twice on 9 different days last year.

You may be wondering how many hot dogs and pizzas did we consume in our madness? My wife and I ate 137 hot dogs, 51 peperoni pizza slices, 3 cheese pizza slices, 2 chicken bakes, 12 turkey sandwiches, 1 chicken sandwich, 104 coffees, 12 smoothies, 2 chocolate ice creams, 14 cookies and 2 soda cups! Adding all that up it leaves us with tax included at just over $860 spent at the food court this year. My wife had a small heart attack when I told her this lol.

Here is the monthly breakdown of our visits just for this year.  


|Months|Visits|Percentage|
|:-|:-|:-|
|01/2024|11|8%|
|02/2024|8|6%|
|03/2024|10|7%|

|11/2024|14|10%|
|12/2024|18|13%|
|Sum|140|100%|

As you can see our least visited month was February while December was our most visited month.

  


|Value|Count|Percentage|
|:-|:-|:-|
|000-099|13|9%|
|100-199|12|9%|

|800-899|12|9%|
|900-999|17|12%|
|Sum|140|100%|

I was also curious which numbers we get most often however it was interesting to see the spread being fairly balanced.

Lastly the total of all our Costco numbers was 73,069! (Total with last year 135,208)

The thing I’m really struggling with is the steam wand. The wand on the LM can pivot and swivel allowing more freedom of movement to find the angle that gets the milk really rolling. I’m just having such a hard time getting consistent results with the tiny, inflexible wand on the GCP.

I’ve seen that you can get the Rancilio Silvia v3 wand to work with the machine, but haven’t found a guide that I’ve confidently been able to follow on installing everything. The best I’ve found is [this post](https://www.coffeeforums.co.uk/threads/gaggia-classic-rancilio-silvia-v3-steam-wand-upgrade-with-pics.17884/) on coffee forums uk which does go in to extreme detail, but leaves me a bit uneasy in terms of sourcing parts and whatnot.

Are there are other options that provide a wonderful with more articulation? Maybe naive, but can a stock wand be bent to be more accommodating?",1,1735699313.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

Maybe someone could reach out and even help myself grow. I'd love to grow. I'd love the help. I'd even record it and give updates on it. Please don't just negative vote this because you disagree. Explain and have conversation. I only know so much. I was a blue collared veteran from the Marines. POG and enlisted. Just trying to evolve and find profit. Please read carefully and understand i do not create this post to sway opinion. Just something that lacks discussion in. Kind of why reddit exists though huh? I'll add jokes here and there to prevent the boring crap from eating away at the common folk. Sorry rockstars guess you'll need to just read some shyt thrower comments here and there. I'd like to have discussions or have some talks on partnerships. I'd love to further my knowledge base. I have a feeling what i want to do i just won't be profitable. 

  
Let just start with this. This post has a couple sections.

1.) Reality: Negative/Positive

2.) Options: To dos 

3.) Could be

4.) My exp



1.) Reality

NEG (it's short and please continue reading. I can be pathetic sometimes <insert tism remark here>)

There is only so much to say here before truth at scale is revealed. Dropshipping has lost its luster. Due to those tightening the grip on newcomers into the industry. Preventing the competition. Typical.  You won't make profit unless you're seeing the full side from the service provider. Who makes the product, ships it, with full customization for themselves because their cashflow is better than yours....(ya po boi.) To offering you a limited at scale option for subscriptions. From recent experiences and towards other individuals. There is a gap for impartial support in the market of dropshipped goods. If one were to collab and create it. I'm certain it'd make some decent profits. (Maybe I'd like to do it with all of you folks.) I keep finding false info on what rhymes with something-ify products. People create apps to assist in the new comer start ups. However, they need to be profitable. To which they really aren't that profitable. They too have their own store similar to yours you're subscribing to build. They create huge social followings and market profitability from selling a sub to you. Ofc they would it's why you are the product they're selling. Themselves to you, you to them. They are the product and so are you. They sell your product and theirs. You sell just yours. (Caught you skipping lines) Remember that. If you want to start a product and want a turn key style business. Dropshipping is no longer it. Its full of some OSS-style consumer science experts. What was used to assist in the distribution industry of all products has succumbed to the Ecommerce trend of sub, build, run ads and forget. This industry is truly more than that. I've found that if you want to start somewhere due to the hard economic chains the wealthy has placed on all of us through their barriers is becoming the same through the nature of the dropshipping community. The buy in for business to be able to compete and get beyond this dystopic inflationary tale of rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. \^\^\^\^\^You must offer a real product or service.\^\^\^\^\^ What do i mean? You can't offer something so easy or small. Ecom and dropshipping was created to assist or test products in the market. It's turned into its own industry. Its not its own industry. Thats why its hurting you. the industry is attached economically to the belts of the big guys offering what you could do. However, its their packaging and their logistics team sending your stuff out. Think you'll be any form of comeptition? You wont' make a big enough coin purse to evolve that's how its designed. It's so niche, for testing, to take money from the (dipshyts) in the mean time. You're the product to sub to their business and they just fulfill orders. It's not real partnerships. How are you profiting and them as well? With current market trends and huge price increases quarterly due to inflation and cost of goods and super cruel partnership agreements there are only so many industry leaders who have a footprint to actually assist you in your start up at a very tiny remote way. That means they know you don't have options. Like you sub to their online service would not ever turn a profit. It wouldn't. it's designed to create entrepreneurs by selling education and dreams on social media then when it gets down to their side of the sales funnel you purchase the subscription and you can't even get pass their marketing through you. Packaged by, sold by, created by, produced by. They package your stuff with their info on the bag or box so it doesn't ever look like yours. They offer terrible packaging for you product, while they package better on theirs. They could find your client base and go ahead and undercut you by securing your customers by your interaction styles. is it corporate espionage? Not really because they're you're partners i guess. They can just data mine you and your efforts. They see what works and they just give you a harder fight to be successful because they're the competition. 



POS

Not everyone in the market is like this. Only key contributors who produce massively at scale and sometimes they don't even know they're doing such a thing. The real intent is to provide services and turn an extra profit. They want to offer goods or services since they lack in other skills or cannot reach a economic goal yet due to their notoriety, renown being low, maybe the product hasn't matured for their brand on its life cycle or whatever reason beyond just screwing you because if you don't make money they don't either, some other skills they may lack could be marketing, idealism, promotion, advertising. However, they also, wish to not take a risk for D2C such as you. Like i said earlier the Ecom game is to test products but has become it's own thing. Sometimes it is more risky to have a direct to consumer style business. If they do the heavy lifting and make your job easier than they earn and you earn. However, sometimes the cost of these actually exceed the profitable means to offer you the service because really your time is harder invested into get the customers. They have built their assembly line, all they need is to print labels for the 10 different options for their product offered per their subscription. Then ship it. I mean that is a positive. Easy for them, easy for you. Yet there is something missing. At scale options for alot of products to sell. i mean for US based manufacturers for ecom and dropshipping. Maybe you could fill that void. 



2.) Options: 

What're the options? Well something-ify is a good option and so are the other 10 websites that offer you rthe same thing. They want you to do great. Everyone has a niche stake in you doing well. What can you do to actually do well...........What can you do? Maybe, email them to discuss a footprint of something real. Ask how to go from ecom style dropshipping to a actual good producer or service provider and offer them a stake in equity within your business. Based upon the saturation of valuation of your style o fbusiness and provoke a real partnership. Now, they can expand their abilities through you and you can expand yours as a real manufacturer. You could also have more clarity about the business style with them. Speak thoroughly and concisely to profits. Describe your issues and try to navigate their ability and make them feel you're actually engaging in business with them as a subscriber. Make them feel like they have work to do. Why? because they have work to do and you're not the product you're a subscribed partner. Record email chains. Make reviews thorough on the companies you go with at all of the professional platforms. Make them acknowledge your issue and existence if they stiff you. request market statistics with a greed upon partnership in contract. Make them feel like what they offer is a guarantee beyond just the subscription and legally feel obligated to help or you may litigate them. If they're promoting you can blah, blah, blah and you don't? who's lying here? you must also commit to your due diligence. not just spend 20 minutes setting a store with AI and use a week of all social media platforms to advertise. Like what're you 16 and horny. Just want to get to the action and fight whoever made you feel bad? Commit. time isn't commitment. You'll know when you created the best website, product etc for those who desire or need it. If it's a money issue. Just relax. This takes time. I am sorry they didn't tell you. Maybe you could do it in a hour. I think the stats may not be in your favor though. Just continue working hard. Don't get played. You're not hustling. You are operating. You are not doing a side business. You are conducting a real business. I hope maybe even this post bring others to you to help. 



TO DOs: 

Leave to Ecom alone or become friend with it

Bring in a group of friend and try to offer them equity by deals etc and use their extra time to help you grow

leave those reviews on everything

show your work don't suffer in silence, take criticism

stack a couple bands them try a real market approach

there is so many websites you could use to help you start or continue. I'd say some but i don't want to be outwardly bias yet. Plus it's just more subscriptions because they found a solution to a problem you'd have trouble with or wouldn't know how to solve if they were not there.

Make it legit. Try and go the full 9 yards of ammo. Do the LLC. Do the branding. Do the banking etc. Leave a footprint. Make your existence known. Don't cheese dyck it fkn rtrd. 

or cheese dk it and enjoy that leaning tower of cheezah duuuuude whoooooooooaaawwwwww (little cartoon culture from back in the day)

  
3.) What Could Be: 

Well what could be done? Nothing, you aint shyt tbh. you can't fight this. Only with your ability as a consumer could you fight this. Use your dollar to your advantage. You could also use the systems they use to promote themselve against them. Indeed, BBB, Google reviews, forums, etc right? Wrong, it'd show how unprofessional you can be because you entered business as a individual and not as a business man. Just kidding, didn't that sound competitive? duh, thats the point. We need that 1990s female with curly hair, pearl/big gold ear rings in her 30s with a check book validating her deals with accountability back on the block. Back when couches were white/ grey with floral designs and light stained oak was standard accents. Make them feel the accountibilty. Make the service provider know they have to change. Why? They won't make any money if we do it together right?



4.) My Exp:

Let me start by saying thank you for reading for this long. You could leave now. The fact you still are reading makes me feel valued even if i don't know you're reading. Means my perspective was analyzed and received. Please don't give up on business or ecom. There is real deals and great opportunity out there. Mine just dried up is all. The only way to make real money is like this: Your friend and you start this together. You do the website and your friend does the dropshipping providing. Use each others times. Switch roles here and there and see what you would love to do. Test your business ability with those you respect via ethics of work and craftsmanship. The exp i had was big issues with actually profiting from using the services provided to me. Even if i was the cheapest about it. I couldn't turn a profit. I'd lose customers due to shipping times, loss to branding that wasn't mine on packaging, loss due to expense of acquiring the conversion was too high. With out a huge online Prescence to compliment your new business you really can't make it that way. Take a massive amount of time. These are all tools to help already existing businesses to get their products to their customers. What provoked me to make a post so controversial or to create a avenue of discussion to settle such issues. I built a few stores for ecom. I did my diligence. I forgot one thing. The probability factors with COAS. My cost of acquisition was so high I was confused how I'd become such a business. Like this would never work. It was true. Unless I became my own manufacturer. I'd not see anything. Now, if I opened 2. stores and launched a huge scheme of marketing for each store and funded it well and made sure my coas for conversion was solid I'd probably have a somewhat livable wage. Wrong, anyway I looked at it.... from acquiring services or goods etc. There is no real way to profit anymore. I was using shopify. I was using prebuilt themes and I did my diligence. I used great .csv files. I even made some seriously good ones. I just wanted to profit enough so i can have enough money to open a lease agreement with the local plaza to start a coffee shop in my local town. My credit isn't the best and tbh, the blue collar work isn't even enough to keep money in the pocket anymore due to the fat bald dudes in VA destroying the budgets. Well, my purchasing power is gone and I am just trying to make ends meet. I discovered that even the (side)Businesses are set up for failure. From miscommunication, bad marketing, bad products being offered to the packaging etc. All of these people from their Apps are just doing what you're doing. They want to have a turn key investment. Well I've learned my lesson. I won't be using this style of business anymore. My money was taken and I won't get it back. Guess I'll just work until i can afford a small business. Even though reits and ETFs are going to destroy my child's future. I will at least run mine into old years of working and offer them at least something worth some sort of freedom. God knows Americxa is free but for some crazy reason we are all wage slaves taxes over 50% every year but if we enact any of our rights we are deemed horrible people. This isn't the country i was told I was in as a child. anyways, sorry about that. I used alot of apps... here they are....avoid them...two main ones and I certain you can imagine the others. If there is a comment or a bunch, I'll go into detail about which ones etc. Just long post

Shopify

dripshipper

all apps to deal with merch and coffee products

all apps to deal with making your store convenient(if you get any apps your store is slow af, how they make you upgrade to a expensive membership) 

  
If you made it this far you probably know I was a bit diligent. If you'd like, I want to seek business partners and new opportunities. I just don't know how to evolve from my blue collar circle. I could be a great addition for marketing if you'd offer me livable wage. Also good in the tech sector. I was cyber with no certs in the jarhead clan of things.

1hqty4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1hqty4h/how_to_teach_15mo_not_to_hitbang/,How to teach 15mo not to hit/bang,"I could use some advice. We're trying to reach our 15mo not to do two things: (1) bang things on tables and (2) hit mommy in the face 😂

She has always loved banging things together or on tables. She loves to make noise, period. But now it happens a lot on our coffee table and at mealtimes, which is loud, disruptive and bad for the furniture.

And then there's her habit of hitting me in the face 😂 it's always playful, not angry or spiteful, but I really want her to learn that this isn't ok. (She does it to my husband sometimes too, but I think pregnancy and breastfeeding have taught her that my body and by extension my face are her personal property 😂 so 9 times out of 10 it's my face)

Anyway, for the most part we've been firmly saying ""no"" twice and if she does it a third time, we take whatever it is (toy, cup, mommy) away for a little while. But now she's learned that banging things on tables is a good way to get attention, so recently we've started turning away and ignoring her for a few moments instead. That generally stops the behavior in the moment but she still tries banging things to get attention so idk if it's really sinking in. 

I've ordered several books on parenting toddlers but I'm not sure if they'll have advice for kids as young as her, so if you have methods that have worked for you, I'd love to hear them. Non-punitive methods only, please.

A while back for some reason my scary adventure story came up at a counselling session, thus:  
Some time between Covid lockdowns, I was alone at work, carrying stuff into a shipping container used for storage. Just at the moment I stepped inside -BAM!- before you could say “reportable workplace incident,” the door shut behind me. I was trapped before I could prop the door open with the plank I kept just inside the door, the first thing I would usually do...for safety. At first I thought maybe somebody sneaked up behind me and shut me in as a bad taste prank.  
Pretty soon I had to face the fact that if someone *had* locked me in, they weren’t coming to say “ha ha, only joking” any time soon. In retrospect, it must have been a freak gust of wind which slammed that heavy door shut.  
I banged on the walls for a while (with my safety plank) and shouted for help, hoping someone might hear me. I knew that occasionally people walk past on their way around the worksite, but I had to make a noise at the right time for somebody to be in earshot. When would that be? I would only hear them go past if they spoke, or trod heavily. Every hour or so I banged and yelled for a while.  
I had no food or water. There was a light in there, but the management had recently removed an internet connected laptop I once had inside, so no communication link to outside.  
I entered just after I had my 10am coffee to boost my work performance. Uh oh, how long could my bladder hold out? I held on for as many hours as I could... but eventually, I had to pee. Terrified that somebody might open the door at that embarrassing moment, I peed on a box of old newspaper like a puppy. Now things were serious- if I did get rescued I would have to try and get rid of the litterbox as unobtrusively as I could. I knew if I was found dead in there the pee would hardly matter, but oh god, please don’t let me have to do the other thing, (the shameful thing,) in case I do get out alive!  
The whole time, I knew perfectly well that I **could** die a lingering painful death in there, but then again perhaps I **could** be rescued the next moment. So hysterical panicking might be wildly unnecessary, or then again, it might be entirely warranted. Whenever you read about people who were trapped for a while, then rescued, as well as those who were trapped and found too late, that’s how the first day must be for them.  
I became dehydrated and a bit dizzy. I knew there was a co-worker due to come in 2 days, but what if he didn’t come??? He was elderly, what if he got sick?  
I had signed the visitors book at the security gatehouse that day. I hoped somebody might check at the end of the day and see that I hadn’t signed out again. There’s only a handful of signatures in that book each day, if they even glanced it would be obvious. But no.  
People who live alone like me can die long before anybody raises the alarm, a fact I was acutely conscious of the whole time I was inside. I didn’t need a Wells Fargo incident to heighten my awareness. I do have one friend, who did phone my home that night, but how was he to know I never made it back that day? How many days before he would suspect something was wrong?  
When I saw through the crack in the door that it was dark outside, I stopped bothering to shout. I got cold, so cold. Luckily it was a mild night but still, I only had a tshirt on. (I had taken off my compulsory high vis vest when I got too hot that morning, so I was asking for it really.) I tried to wrap myself up in newspaper & sheets of cardboard to keep warm, and get a few spells of sleep, but inevitably I had to get up often and walk around to keep warm.  
I remember dozing, and having the crazy dreamthought “if only I could slip out back to the office for a moment and get some water to bring back here, then I wouldn’t be so thirsty while I wait to be rescued.”  
\*\*\*  
The terrifying noises at night went bump… tap tap tap… screee-eeee-eeek. Presumably bird feet on the metal roof, and the scratching of tree branches, but of course it sounded like a creepy psycho murderer with knives, and would have even more so without a light on; I would undoubtedly be in a straitjacket now.  
\*\*\*  
Finally,  
after 24 hours,  
a passing forklift driver heard my periodical banging and yelling for help. My hero! He was pretty shocked.  
If he hadn’t heard me, well, another lockdown was instigated 2 days later, and nobody from my organisation was allowed on site for months!  
After I told my counsellor this saga, she said “oh my god, were you traumatised?” and I replied, no, not really. She asked “well, why not?”  
and I told her truthfully:  
***it’s because that’s the least of my problems,***  
and we both laughed :D :D :D

I am originally from the mainland where I didn’t have this equipment and space is more abundant. Since arriving in Hawaii in 2015, I’ve basically just piled this stuff on the lanai. I am moving to a place with a smaller lanai which means if I do this there, I won’t even be room to sit and have a coffee.

I don’t want to put it in my bedroom closet due to lack of space there and also, the dirt and sand.

My building has no storage lockers or anything external to the unit. 

I was hoping to find a utility cabinet or something… maybe a creative way to hang it from the lanai ceiling?

Prompt: Make the most unhinged, stupid, crazy ai Batman script. Make it obviously ai and make it completely stupid.

Here is what it responded with: 

Scene 1: Batman’s Batcave

(The Batcave is a giant, endless room with a Batcomputer that's powered by a literal tornado of bats. Batman is sitting at the Batcomputer, staring intently at a screen that shows a picture of a pizza. Alfred stands behind him, holding a massive sandwich made entirely of bread.)

Batman (monotone, emotional):
Alfred… I think the pizza… is trying to communicate with me.

Alfred (confused):
Master Wayne, that's… just a pizza. It’s from Domino's.

Batman (slightly twitching):
No, Alfred. It's not just any pizza. It's THE pizza. The one that will decide the fate of Gotham. The one with pineapple.

Alfred (sighs):
Right. And I assume you’ve already stared at it for 17 hours and 42 minutes?

Batman (suddenly standing up and shaking violently):
ALFRED! THE PINEAPPLE IS A LIE! I KNOW THE TRUTH! WE’VE BEEN EATING IT ALL WRONG!

(He slams his fist on the Batcomputer, sending a shockwave through the cave that causes a statue of a bat to fall on top of a giant rubber duck.)

Scene 2: The Streets of Gotham

(Meanwhile, on the streets of Gotham, the villain known as The Taco is wreaking havoc. He is throwing tacos into the air, and they are somehow exploding into fireworks. Batman watches from a nearby rooftop, but it’s hard to take him seriously because he’s wearing a full-body bat suit that also has a cape made of cheese.)

Batman (whispering to himself):
I have to stop this… but I can’t do it alone. I need… The Batman Emergency Support Hotline.

(He pulls out a tiny phone the size of a flea and dials the number. The phone rings exactly one time before a random voice picks up.)

Voice on the phone (excitedly):
Hello! You've reached the Batman Emergency Support Hotline! How can I assist you in saving Gotham today?

Batman (distracted by a squirrel on a nearby building):
I need your help. A taco-themed villain is exploding tacos all over Gotham. I need... a plan.

Voice (pauses, then confidently):
Absolutely, Batman. I have the perfect solution! You need a… really big spoon.

Batman (gritting his teeth):
A spoon?

Voice (enthusiastically):
Yes! A spoon! But wait—there’s more! You need a spoon with a jet engine attached to it. That way, you can scoop up the tacos at superspeed, saving Gotham from Taco Armageddon.

Batman (nodding to himself):
Of course… The Spoon of Fate.

Scene 3: The Battle with The Taco

(Batman arrives in the Batmobile, which is now also a giant pizza delivery car. The car’s engine roars, and it transforms into a giant flying taco. Batman jumps out, wielding a spoon with a jet engine on it. The Taco villain is standing there, dramatically tossing tacos into the air, oblivious to Batman’s imminent arrival.)

The Taco (laughing maniacally):
You can’t stop me, Bat-man! No one can stop THE TACO! They’ll all bow to the power of my guacamole!

Batman (dramatic, cheese cape billowing in the wind):
You underestimate the power of... a spoon.

(He activates the jet engine, and the spoon immediately launches into the air with the force of a thousand exploding burritos. Batman begins to scoop up the tacos, throwing them into a massive, self-replicating taco dimension portal that he summoned by accident.)

The Taco (screaming in horror):
NOOO! YOU CAN'T JUST SCOOP MY PLANET AWAY!

Batman (smiling smugly):
You forgot, Taco. Gotham doesn’t do tacos. We do pizza. And even then, we question the pineapple.

(The portal closes. The tacos disappear. Gotham is saved.)

Scene 4: Batman Returns to the Batcave

(Back in the Batcave, Batman is sitting, eating a sandwich made entirely of bread. Alfred watches him with a look of quiet despair.)

Alfred (muttering):
What have we done? Is this the world we’ve created?

Batman (slamming his sandwich down):
No, Alfred. This is the world we saved. The Taco was just a distraction, but the real enemy was... the pineapple pizza conspiracy.

(A dramatic pause. Batman looks out into the distance as thunder cracks. A crow flies by, but it’s wearing sunglasses.)

Batman (whispering):
I’ll be ready for the next attack. The spaghetti cult. They’re coming. And this time… I won’t let them get away with putting spaghetti in the coffee machine.

Alfred (exasperated):
Master Wayne… You do realize, you’ve been sitting in the Batcave for 36 hours eating nothing but bread, right?

Batman (smiling devilishly):
Yes, Alfred. But bread... is the future.

(Cue dramatic music. Fade to black. The credits roll with a list of 50 random objects and a text that says, “Directed by AI.”)

THE END



**Story two:**

Title: BATMAN: THE GREAT LUNCHABLE WAR

Prompt: Make a new story, use Batman’s rouges! Make it more stupid and twisted

Scene 1: The Dark Knight’s Pre-Lunch Crisis

(The Batcave is eerily quiet. Batman stands in front of the Batcomputer, staring intently at a single Lunchable box. It’s the “Ham & Cheddar” variety, but something is wrong. Batman’s eyes twitch.)

Batman (whispering to himself):
There’s no crackers... Only ham. The crackers... they’re gone.

(Alfred enters, holding a massive tray of boiled eggs. He looks at Batman with mild concern.)

Alfred:
Master Wayne, I don’t understand. You’ve been here for three hours... staring at a single Lunchable. What has happened?

Batman (suddenly standing, eyes wide):
Alfred, the crackers… they’ve been stolen. By someone worse than the Joker. Someone much worse.

Alfred (nodding):
Yes, but… I still don’t understand. It’s just lunch. It's... lunch.

Batman (slamming his fist on the Batcomputer):
The Lunchables are the key, Alfred! This is bigger than Gotham! This is about snacktime supremacy! And I know exactly who’s behind it: The Penguin.

Scene 2: The Penguin’s Lair

(In a dimly lit, absurdly over-the-top lair resembling a discount ice cream truck, The Penguin, wearing an absurdly small tuxedo, stands atop a mountain of snack-sized crackers. He laughs maniacally, his flippers flapping as he tosses individual crackers into the air.)

The Penguin (laughing):
At last, Gotham will bow to my cracker kingdom! No one will dare question the Penguin’s Snack Empire now! Every Lunchable will be mine! HA-HA!

(Suddenly, a crash echoes through the lair. Batman bursts through the door in his Batmobile, which is inexplicably shaped like a giant pickle. The car transforms into a fully operational sandwich submarine.)

Batman (pointing at Penguin):
Stop this madness, Penguin! You cannot control the snacks of Gotham!

Penguin (scoffing):
I already have, Batman! Your crackers are mine!

(Batman pulls out a remote control and presses a button. From behind the Penguin, a large machine resembling a giant stapler emerges and starts randomly stapling slices of processed cheese onto the Penguin’s flippers.)

Batman (menacingly):
That’s right, Penguin. Now you will face… THE SANDWICH STAPLER OF JUSTICE.

Scene 3: Enter the Other Villains

(Just as Batman is about to face the Penguin in the ultimate snack standoff, a massive explosion erupts in the lair. Out of the smoke emerges a bizarre trio of villains.)

The Riddler (dressed as a giant burrito):
Batman! You’ve walked right into my trap! I knew you’d come for the crackers, but it’s time to solve the real riddle… the mystery of the missing pizza rolls!

Batman (confused):
What? What missing pizza rolls?

The Riddler (smirking):
That’s the riddle! Find the pizza rolls, Batman, or Gotham falls into an abyss of mediocrity! Where… where snack foods no longer have meaning!

(Suddenly, Harley Quinn bursts in, riding a giant inflatable duck. She’s holding a bat, but the bat is literally just a hot dog on a stick.)

Harley Quinn (laughing hysterically):
Oh, puddin’! This is gonna be SO much fun! I’m here to throw the mustard on this mess! WOOHOO!

(A giant inflatable hot dog also bursts from the wall, and the Joker emerges from within, holding a ketchup bottle that sprays in the shape of a giant smiling face.)

Joker (gleefully):
That’s right, Batsy! You’re too late! The Gotham Snack Revolution has already begun! And guess who’s the Snack King now? THIS GUY! SHEESH!

(The Joker holds up a tray of half-eaten nachos with a single olive on top, like it’s the Holy Grail.)

Scene 4: The Ultimate Snack Battle

(The Batcave transforms into a chaotic, apocalyptic battlefield. Penguin launches crackers like frisbees, while the Riddler’s burrito suit makes him dangerously elusive. Harley Quinn bounces around on her inflatable duck, whacking everyone with her hot dog bat.)

Batman (dodging a flying cracker):
This ends now, villains! Gotham's snack time will never fall into chaos!

(Batman pulls out a gadget that looks like a combination of a blender and a toaster. It starts firing snack-sized granola bars at high speeds, knocking the villains back.)

Batman (shouting):
I will not allow Gotham to be turned into a snack wasteland!

Joker (mockingly):
Oh, Batsy, you’ll never stop us! You can’t even figure out how to properly fold a tortilla! HAHAHA!

(Batman pauses, then pulls out a tortilla and proceeds to fold it with precise, unsettling efficiency. He hands it to Joker.)

Batman (deadpan):
There. Happy now?

Joker (pauses, confused):
Wait… WHAT? How did you—?

(Just as Joker is about to scream, the entire lair starts shaking. The giant inflatable hot dog collapses, and a massive explosion of nacho cheese erupts from the walls.)

Batman (grimly):
You’ve gone too far, Joker. The cheese is the final straw.

Scene 5: The Unexpected Twist

(In the final moments of the battle, Batman realizes something truly horrifying. As he pulls out a tray of actual crackers from his utility belt, he is confronted by the last villain… Catwoman.)

Catwoman (calmly holding a jar of peanut butter):
Batman… You’ve been so focused on crackers, you missed the real danger… the peanut butter. It’s creamy… and smooth… and it’s taking over Gotham’s snack industry.

Batman (eyes widening):
No… not the peanut butter.

Catwoman (smirking):
Oh yes. The peanut butter conspiracy is real. I’ve been working with the peanut lobbyists for years. The crackers? A distraction. The real plan? To spread peanut butter across every sandwich, every cracker, and every tortilla in Gotham. Forever.

(Batman gasps, horrified.)

Batman (breathlessly):
But… but you can’t… There’s no bread left for it.

Catwoman (holding up a loaf of bread made entirely of gold):
There is now.

Final Scene:

(The Batcave is silent. Gotham’s fate hangs in the balance. Batman stands alone in the wreckage, holding a single cracker, staring at it as if it’s the last hope of humanity.)

Batman (whispering):
I must make a choice... to stop the Peanut Butter Crisis... or to let it unfold and watch Gotham crumble under the weight of… too much creaminess.

(Suddenly, a large billboard outside the Batcave lights up: “PIZZA DAY SALE – 50% OFF EVERYTHING” and Batman drops the cracker. He walks toward the Batmobile with a new mission.)

Batman (determined):
No. There’s always one solution. Pizza.

1hqtndm,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1hqtndm/what_do_i_say_to_mom/,What do I say to mom?,"My (F30) mom (50's), is recently divorced from my bio dad. Long story short, he was a neglectful pos who cheated on her and made the divorce drag out but it wrapped up in July 2024.

My mom is the type to bottle up or hide how she's feeling unless she's alone. Previous relationships have left her very...anti men, but lonely and desperate for companionship. She's very independent, stuck in her ways and wants someone to share her life with without having having to compromise or sacrifice her independence. It's semi unreasonable - I've explained this but her stance is that if a man can take her as is, she doesn't want them.

It's New Years Eve and the guy (Guy A) she has gone on a few dates with has been acting like a jerk - her words and no further explanation. I think she spooked him and he's pudding her away - he's also recently divorced, more recent than she is (like 2 months recent) and after only two dates she asked if this was going to lead to anything or if he was just trying to hangout because she's not interested in hanging out. I told her it was way too early to bring up the ""what are we"" but...clearly she didn't listen. The other guy she started talking to has a history with her and they were supposed to go out tonight.

The guy (Guy B) she was supposed to go out with tonight dated her in high school. Now...this guy...woof...he just started talking to my mom again after running into my grandmother. (I guess he went to where my gma works, saw a picture of my mom (my gma has her office thoroughly decorated with family pictures) and asked how she knew my mom and he reached out to my mom following that) Guy B went out to lunch with my mom to ""pick her brain"" about....divorce. Apparently his marriage is a disaster and he's not even staying at his house anymore. In his words, his wife is a leach who doesn't work and only spends his money and he's decided to stay with his sister until he gets the ball rolling on divorcing. On Christmas Eve, he calls my mom, drunk, spouting off about how he and his group of friends got kicked out of the bowling alley because they were trying to close. You know...because it's Christmas Eve. And why my mom went to go see him...idk. She met up, they went and got some coffee and after talking...he. kissed. my. mom. TWICE. 

My mom told him enough, that nothing was going to halogen because he's freaking married and he needs to be divorced because (she's been down this road before) she's not going to be the ""other woman"". Fast forward tonight, I guess they were supposed to meet up but he stood her up.

Now...I don't have any context for this otherwise but she called me, obviously crying but trying to be hush hush about it. I told her.i was sorry that guys are trash and that dating is hard. I told her to go to bed and invited her to come hangout tomorrow to vent or otherwise distract herself - I doubt she will. 

But I'm just at a loss for what to say to keep her from shutting down and giving up. My mom is the type of person who can't be alone for too long because she gets lonely and depressed. Being older isn't helping either due to issues that are age related (no kids at home, going through menopause, general age related health issues). She's not unattractive, in fact, in the past three years, she's lost over 200 pounds. She works a full time job, makes decent money. She's also super fun to hangout with and super funny.

But she's blind to all of this because my mother has virtually no self confidence outside of what others think of her. Not even my own words of encouragement matter to her. ""You have to say that because you're my daughter."" Like, no, I really don't. But...yeah. I'm just at a loss. I wish she would take some time learn to love herself and be okay with being alone but that's not a conversation she's willing to have, let aline be receptive to. Also, to add, she is vehemently against therapy. ",1,1735698059.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

He didn't give me any mixed signals 
He always said Yes to hangout
We had a really great sex
He said “I know this is too early but I want to say I love you because the sex feels so right”

We hung out at each others place couple of times, see each other 1-2 times per week.

He always kisses me like every 10 minutes whenever we are together in person.

He totally seemed like he was so into me.

But one day, I initiated my frustration on him over text. Saying why didn't you checking on me more and text me more? 

Then he called me and said let's talk about us.

He said he likes me a lot but thats it. He cannot see himself to say I love you to me.
He said everything is great and you are really quality women but he cannot see me in his future. 

I was confused. We talked about it for 50 minutes and agreed to move on. 

And my anxiety kicked in, I called him back right away crying, asked him to try a little bit more because 2 months is too short to know each other, and what we had was too good to just let go.

His voice changed and said “I already made up my mind”


I couldn't sleep at all.

I spent the night thinking about us and processing all that happened and his word, texted him in the morning, I get it and I will move on. Maybe we could meet one day to have a cup of coffee or something.

And he said of course we can still hangout and reach out to him whenever I need him.

I guess we said goodbye on good terms.

I immediately unfollowed him on IG and deleted all the text messages. 

But I have little intuitive feeling that he might reach out back to me in a couple of weeks or so. 

I just had feeling something is not really clearly over.

Am I being delusional? ( I think I am) 

2 months of relationship hit me really hard and I don't know if I can get over him pretty soon.

It NYE and I am a single, late 30s guy posting on r4r. I am clearly the coooooooolest and eveyone wants to hang out with me! No. I am not celebrating the New Years with frozen pizza…..

Let’s get some things out of the way. I am an atheist. I don’t want kids or to be a step dad.  I am fairly left leaning. I am not a communist or socialist, but I’ve been called it. I am a very bad texter. I often text back in between activities so I tend to be brief. I am more of a voice chatter.

So let’s get to it. I am single. I would like to unsingle. This is reddit and I don’t think this will happen here. However. Nice fun conversation is something that could happen. That’s great. 

I am tragically boring and mediocre person. I know I am suppose to sell myself on how cool I am but……….. I’m not. [Insert Giggles] You know what, I am damn proud of it. Took me a lot of work to get my 3.0 at a mid tier college so I can work my regular job at my cube farm. Not everyone, can be as cool as Elon. Joking. I am joking. I have played DnD, not joking. I often un-ironically think, “I am too old for this.” I even own one of those daily pill organizers. I swear I am 39. I checked. I am bad at math, but I am not THAT BAD at math. I hope. I am guilty of being a typical millennial male in which I have done these things in a cringe way; done stand up comedy, played in a metal band, thought I was cool for being a gamer and many more. Just ask! I don’t care much for sushi and I dislike IPAs. Look, I don’t hate sushi, I’ll go and I’ll be happy. I never crave it and would choose to just go get a sandwich. I do like my lightly roasted coffees though. Oh goddammit. I am DRINKING a light roast brew as I write this. I am a ham burger enthusiast. I have never seen Breaking Bad or the Wire.

Currently my life is busy. I work and I am a bit of a workaholic at the moment because I am trying to make changes, and advances to my current career. Maybe even a career change. I am also trying to change my living situation. So a lot of my energy is directed at be productive. I am not a die -hard workaholic in which this is my complete lifestyle. I am just trying to make changes. However. I do like to “work” at things. I get deep into hobbies and subjects. I am investing heavily into my health by working out regularly and eating better. I am really looking to increasing my physical activity. I feel as I age, fitness is more critical.  All I want for my future, at this moment, is to work at a job I enjoy, and to be healthy. Yes. My schedule is stacked. I do want to and like to, take time from being productive to spend time with friends and to do fun things. 

What are fun things I like doing? As I hope to draw this workaholic phase to a close soon I would like to start a Punk Rock band, establish a marijuana farm and spend more time at the climbing gym. I am totally lying. I am not that cool. I used to spend a lot of time at galleries and museums when I was in college and I really miss doing so. I feel very fortunate to live on the west coast and I should go out and experience more for this region. I would really like to get more politically involved. I participate in election canvassing this past election and I feel like need to do so again and participate in a greater degree. I want to get into the performing arts. I want be in a play at least once. I am embarrassingly under-read and I want to read more. 

Lets hit the controversial malarkey. Atheist. Very atheist. I never lost the faith, because I never had it to begin with. I am  not spiritual either. I don’t even know what it means to be spiritual. Politically, I really care about the environment, infrastructure, limiting the power and influence of the rich, and education. I don’t think Elon is or was cool. Not wanting to be a parent is pretty self explanatory?  You don’t have to aligned with me on these ideas. I am pretty open and accepting. I just want to put it out there for those who find this important. 

What am I looking for here? Conversation would be a nice start, especially over voice chats. See my bad texter comment. If you ever hang out with me I promise to bake you cookies.",4,1735697901.0,cf4cf,1,0.83,False

Now I know caffeine isnt great if not moderated or careful with but it worked out! Ive always been curious what caffeine could do to me. I have never liked anything that has caffeine in it and never knew there was an option of drink mix powders with caffeine. I hate soda (carbonation), tea and coffee.  Also everyone has always been like you should not do it we cant imagine the amount of energy youd bounce off the walls wed be scared for you. 

So, when I found out there were drink mixes I spent the past year going back and forth of forgetting and debating. I finally made a choice to test it out. 

It was 75 mg so not much I think compared to the daily healthy limit. I drank it around 12:50 and by 1:20 I felt sleepy for like a minute and then it was like a switch flipped when I thought about what I needed/wanted to do. On top of that my brain like dampened/calmed the hell down. Like it wasn't silenced but like it was like my head stopped bouncing and throwing balls of thoughts all over the room. I started laundry I budgeted, I made a sandwhich and during that process I heard the dryer go off. My boyfriend then told me it was off and ready and I heard him! Like it wasnt he talked and it didnt click, it was I heard him say it and responded yea I heard it and (even bigger thing) said I needed to finish making sandwhich.

Then when I finished I put all the stuff away, I wasnt bouncing around like crazy (inside and out) I just put it away. Then I even remembered and headed downstairs to check the dryer! I then restarted it as clothes weren't dry and went upstairs and grabbed my food and ate. I also was doing something I forgot what though (caffeine has to have worn off cause Im back to my normal self) But even while doing stuff I still could hear and process what my boyfriend told me each time the first time. I dont know how to like just describe the absolute peace? like of mind and flow of just being. 

I even like after I finished and my clothes were ready I got dressed. Then I put my siblings seat in my car. I got all my stuff ready to go and I didn't forget any of them and left on time to get my sibling. Anyways hours later I know it has to be gone. But now I think I have gotten a taste of actually feeling functional. It was just something Ive never felt the closest like sorta similar I've gotten is when I tunnel vision focus (maybe its hyperfocus or something) and I feel good on the one thing but instead of that it was just being productive.

Maybe its not adhd, Im told a lot that I probably have it.  normally I always ended up friends or getting along better with autistic, audhd and adhd folks (are diagnosed) who have at one point all asked and called it that Ive got adhd. But Im not willing to accept any of my suspicions fully until psychiatrist visit confirms its that, something else or nothing at all and Im just broken in the head.

I just wanted to get this all out because as much as it's not big on the outside it was huge for me inside. My boyfriend cant really understand. Even talking to him he's like yea thats just how normal people are. And I responded yea for you and everyone else maybe but for me it was practically like a new experience a whole different (originally thought new and thought of aladdin a whole new worlllddd) world. Also in case Im sorry if I do not belong here I just always lurk and a lot of post feel so relatable to majority of my life 

I also dont want to use caffeine too much. I pray I dont become very tolerant and I plan to save using any for important days/deadlines or when Im gonna have a rough day so around my period probably😅. I am also now leaning towards if I do get diagnosed to get meds straightaway. My main fear is just first off am I even going to be diagnosed it could be nothing at all or maybe something else and then if I was welll, the side effects.

TLDR :  I tried caffeine for the first time and it went really well. Im really shocked and excited about how much I did and could function in so little time and not struggle. Cant wait for a doctor to help me.",1,1735697773.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I'm not one to normally ask them for anything as they normally give willingly. But I made a request today specifically as we have a belief or superstitition that whatever you have or do on the 1st day of the year may go through for the rest of the year. 

I love how they both remembered and made sure I started the year right and it's not even New Year their time. 😅

I am looking to start a small business in the near future and am planning and saving for it. The vision is to roast in-house for our coffee program with beans available for retail.

I envision to run 20kg espresso and 1kg filter per week behind the bar. There will be an addition of approximately 5kg in volume for retail. 

Looking at the Aillio Bullet R2 pro, which is well under 5k, which fits into my startup cost. Not sure if there’s anything that comes close.

For those with the Aillio R2 Pro, would love to hear your opinions too!

Coat a family pack of boneless thighs (don’t crucify me, it’s family preference) in flour and preferred seasonings, I used salt pepper Ragin Cajun and Goya Adobo

Put a quarter cup oil in a skillet, pan fry for golden brown color, no need to cook fully. 

Once all fried, remove chicken and set aside; slice 1-2 lb andouille or preferred smoked sausage, and sauté in the same pan. 

Set sausage aside once nicely crisped, reserve fat in pan. Add a couple tbsp of oil and add four to five tablespoons of flour and putcha roux together. You’ll want this thicker than a gumbo, so aim for a dirty blonde/cappuccino colored roux. No points for making a black coffee roux here. 

Throw your trinity in the roux and stir until veggies are quite translucent. 

Toss in minced garlic and sauté to fragrant.

Add in three-four tablespoons tomato paste, sauté until you get a dark color on the paste. 

Add in a 28 oz can of tomato puree, and stir to combine. Cooking this down about five-ten minutes on high heat wouldn’t be a bad idea. Adds depth. 

Finally add in four cups/one box chicken stock, along with your sausage and pan fried chicken, a couple bay leaves, a few shakes of Cajun seasoning, and a carpal tunnel inducing amount of cracked pepper. Couple shakes of cayenne, crystal, and MSG never hurt either. 

Want to wild out? Few shakes of fish sauce. Keeps you young. 

Hard simmer 2 hours or until tomato flavor is deepened and chicken is tender, 3 hours if you used bone-in chicken. 

Make some rice, however you like.

I thought, *okay, maybe he’s just weird.* WRONG. This man proceeds to loudly lecture the staff—yes, the Balinese staff—on how they’ve been “brewing coffee wrong” for generations. He ends with: “I lived in Portland, so I know these things.” SIR. SIT DOWN.

It gets worse. The guy starts chatting up this poor solo traveler at the next table, casually dropping gems like:

* “You’re so much more *authentic* than the locals here.”
* “I bet you’d look great on my Insta. I’ve got, like, 15K followers.”

FIFTEEN. K. FOLLOWERS. Like that’s a global currency now?? 🫠

By the time he started pitching her a *“soul-alignment retreat”* he’s hosting (read: a weekend of beach yoga and dodging accountability), I had to leave before my secondhand embarrassment took me out completely.

So, **who else has run into these walking parody expats?** I know this sub’s got stories. Spill the tea:

* The worst expat grift you’ve seen?
* Cringiest influencer behavior?
* Straight-up illegal messes they think no one notices?

She was introduced to the unfairness in the world at a very early age. Both of her parents were outcasts in her own community. Katrina's mother, Dr. Michelle Vickram, was shunned for practicing witchcraft, something which fueled the ire of her father, a cynical alchemist struggling with depression and alcoholism. Despite this, the two raised their daughter to never lose faith in people, even when they're at their worst.    
Katrina's life would take a dark turn when a man set fire to her home and left her with severe burns. It later turned out to be a hate crime. Then after she recovered, her parents divorced, and she and her mother moved to Reole. Katrina became more secluded, more bitter toward people. She grew her hair out to hide her scars. But Michelle stuck by her side, reminding her daughter to never forget her light.
Empowered by this, Katrina began putting herself out into the world again. She made new friends, found a job as a barista, and eventually, started taking the problems of the world head on. And although she still struggles to show her whole self, Katrina proves to be a fun, loving, and often goofy person to anyone lucky enough to see it.    
    
(Katrina first meets Ed, Winry and Alphonse shortly after being resurrected. They bump into her in Resembool while she's performing *Linger*.)    
    
Quick Facts:    
- Katrina is a massive Silent Hill fan. Ask her anything, she'll tell you. One of her favorite songs to play on her guitar is Theme of Laura (with the solo).    
- Along with her hair, Katrina conceals her scars with her clothes. She has them on 26% of her body.    
- Katrina grew up around religion all her life, but she considers herself agnostic.    
- You'll never find her going without at least one cup of coffee a day. She usually drinks two.    
- Katrina has bright blue-green eyes, a trait she got from her father.    ",2,1735696890.0,FullmetalAlchemist,1,0.75,False
1hqtby9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hqtby9/dad_blocked_me_after_i_reminded_him_of_him/,Dad blocked me after I reminded him of him emailing his ex wife behind GF’s back. ,"Okay so there is quite a bit more to it than this. 

In 2018 my father re-married to possibly the worst woman I have ever met. Eventually they divorced after she kicked him out at the start of the pandemic thinking he would come crawling back, he didn’t. 

He swiftly found a new girlfriend, some 3 months later.

My father grew up in the care system, is almost definitely autistic and never been very in touch with his emotions, for some backing information - in his relationships he has always liked to be mothered and essentially goes off radar when in relationship, I think I saw him 4 times last year. 

Anyway, about 6 months into his new relationship, he begins phoning me every week complaining about how crazy she was, that she must be going through menopause and he’s been telling her she needs to quit the stupid behaviour. 

He eventually divulges to my sisters that his ex wife had been emailing him (he blocked her too funnily enough, but she had been stalking/harassing him) and she suggested that they meet up for a coffee. My siblings and I spoke and we got the impression he enjoyed this sense of being chased. Nevertheless he didn’t tell me any of this because he knows I don’t keep my opinions to myself and I generally call people out on when they’re being a shit cunt. 

One day he calls and I take him to task about it, I explain that he is being a shitty person and that I didn’t care how bad things were in his relationship, he shouldn’t be emailing his ex wife behind his girlfriends back. I told him I was ashamed of him and that he didn’t raise me to be that kind of man. This hit home for him and he seemed very upset. 

Fast forward to most recently, I have my own issues with my father because he doesn’t quite grasp the fact that he and I have no relationship, it’s probably fair to say that I resent his girlfriend for how controlling she is of him. Every occasion I see him, his girlfriend whispers in his ear that it’s time to go after having spent a mere hour with him, because she needs to get home to watch her soap operas. 

Most recently my brother in laws father passed away and my father didn’t attend the funeral. I felt hurt for my brother in law, his family and my sister. I felt that he hadn’t considered the representation of a father, what it would mean to my brother in law or my sister. His reasoning was that he had been to too many funerals last year and couldn’t face it. 

I knew almost immediately this was bullshit and that the real reason was because my mother would be there, whom of which he hates more than anything. I messaged a few days later to explain that I felt upset he didn’t go, when he explained his reasoning I called him out on it being because my mum would be there and he half agreed. 

I began explaining to him that I was hurt that he didn’t make any effort to see us, or have any relationship with us and that I had asked him time and time again to meet with him.

Initially I was met with anger when I called him a bullshitter but his tone via text changed to sympathetic. I then left it and didn’t reply because I was upset.

Some hours went by and he messaged again, this time I was certain he had gotten home from work, explained to his girlfriend our falling out who then reignited a fire in him, probably riling him up by saying I was patronising him, or something along those lines. 

He messages “and another thing, gone are the days I deal with you having fucking meltdowns, I’m done with your stupidity.” I was honestly shocked, this obviously angered me, so I asked him how he could go from sympathetic to then trying to restart the argument with inflammatory remarks, to which he simply responded “just leave it now.”

So I asked him “stupidity? Do you mean like emailing your ex wife about going for coffee behind your girlfriend’s back?” He simply replied “thanks mate, (GFs name) saw that. She’s broken up with me. Hope your happy” 

I replied “I’m sorry but I thought I was having a conversation with my father, not her? is nothing between us ever confidential?” 

He has since blocked me on everything. I haven’t heard from him since 15th December. Honestly I don’t know how to feel, I’m angry and hurt. All my life both of my parents have been emotionally immature, unavailable and toxic.

1hqtbth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/1hqtbth/issues_with_my_orthodox_inlaws_post_my_orthodox/,Issues with my Orthodox In-Laws post my Orthodox Conversion,"Some background: My fiancé (50M) and I (38F) have been together for 6 years. His family is Orthodox Jewish. My Jewish background is a little messier: my dad is Jewish. I had a conservative conversion about 3 years into our relationship (his family did not accept this). I had an Orthodox conversion this past year (his family does accept this). We both live a secular life. We are having a non-Orthodox Jewish wedding next year. 

Before my Orthodox conversion— his family was opposed to our relationship. They lived across the country, so we were in some ways insulated from the worst of their behavior. However, I felt their disapproval especially through their silence. In 4 years, they never had a conversation with me. They would rarely ask questions about me. When I finally visited NYC, his sister did not want to meet me at first and would not invite me to her house. She then decided it would be better to meet me, but we met at a neutral territory: a coffee shop. When his family visited LA for a Bar Mitzvah, they were polite, but never initiated a conversation with me. I found this behavior to be cruel and hurtful to me and my partner. When it was clear we were going to be together for the long term, they were much more vocal to him about their disapproval. His mother cried as she told him he was raised to never marry a non-Jewish woman. I was surprised by how inflexible they were given this would be his second marriage and he was in his 40s.

Prior to the Orthodox conversion, I had a conversation with his sister, where I said “we’re old. Not in our 20s. Can’t we just support \[my partner\] in his happiness”. Her response was that she knows that’s all he wants is to be love and supported. And she wish should give it to him, but it goes against her religion. 

Eventually, I had an Orthodox conversion— this was fully initiated by me and my partner. We received no help or support through the process by his family. 

After the Orthodox conversion, they’ve been, let’s just say, nicer. They message me nice things. However, they’ve never once asked me about my experience or my feelings of their prior treatment. They aren't giving any money to help us with the wedding. 

I feel like I can never trust them. I see how they treated me as an outsider. I fear how they’ll treat my family members, as they are non-Jews. I fear how they will use their religious beliefs to hurt myself or others in the future. My partner wants us to all get along. However, I will be cordial, but I do not like them. 

How should I handle the distrust in this relationship with his family? ",8,1735696867.0,Jewish,6,0.9,False

1hqt2lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hqt2lw/my_neighbor_perched_himself_on_top_of_a_pine_tree/,"My neighbor perched himself on top of a pine tree in my backyard and never came down. The sheriff of our small town did the same, only a day later.","When Henry perched himself atop that pine tree, I thought he’d just lost his damn mind. No amount of convincing from Jim or the sheriff could coax him down. He ascended into the canopy and never returned.

Never returned alive, at least.

He’d always been an eccentric. It wasn’t easy living next-door to Henry, but it certainly wasn’t dull, either. Between the small city of birdhouses he maintained around the perimeter of his two-story house, the free homebrewed mead that appeared on our doorstep the first of every month, and the early morning French Horn recitals, he was a handful.

I rather liked the ongoing spectacle, all things considered. Jim never really saw the humor in Henry’s mania. That said, crippling agoraphobia has prevented me from leaving the house for almost a year now, so my threshold for what qualifies as entertainment is quite a low bar to clear.

My husband was on his way to confront Henry about his newest hobby, metal detecting, when he first scaled that twenty-foot tall pine in our backyard. It wasn’t the act of metal detecting that bothered Jim - it was the many untended holes that vexed him. The sixty-something year old found himself too lost in paroxysms of archeological fervor to bother filling the quarries back up with soil after he made them. After days of steady excavation, it looked like Henry had been sweeping his property for landmines.

That morning, Jim saw the man creeping towards the edge of the forest thirty yards from our kitchen window, and he sprang into action. If I’m recalling correctly, he shouted something like, “*I’m going to nip this in the bud*” as he jogged out the front door, which now carries a cruel cosmic irony when examined in retrospect.

The scene unfolded before me through the dusty lens of our den’s cheap telescope, which has a lovely panoramic view of the backyard and the thicket beyond from where we keep it.

As much as it pains me to admit it, fear of the space outside my house has turned me into a bit of a snoop.

Jim sauntered up to our neighbor, but Henry didn’t turn around to greet him. Nor did he stop lurching forward. He didn't even react to Jim, as far as I could tell. It was like he was moving in slow-motion autopilot. Although irritated, it wasn’t like my husband’s molten rage drove Henry to the top of that pine out of a concern for his safety.

No matter what Jim did or said, Henry remained locked in an impenetrable trance. A man on a mission.

He gave up on catching Henry’s attention by the time he had made it three quarters of the way up. As Jim started to walk back, I kept watching. Henry, the sleepwalker, never changed his pace. Each identical movement was eerily slow and deliberate. After reaching the apex, he positioned himself to face our home, extended both arms palms up in front of his chest, and became impossibly still. An unblinking gargoyle baking in the early morning summer sun.

At least, I thought he stationary.

When I checked on him an hour later through the telescope, however, he had spun his torso about thirty degrees west. Arms still extended, eyes still open, but his body had turned. Concerned and captivated in equal measure, I began observing him continuously.

While I watched, nothing seemed to change, and I was becoming progressively unnerved by his uncanny stillness. But when I paused my vigil after about twenty minutes, something occurred to me - he *was* moving. I could tell when I brought my eye away from the telescope. Looking through the den window, his torso had clearly pivoted another fifteen degrees clockwise. The motion was just so slow that I found it hard to perceive in real time.

I put my eye back to the lens of the telescope.

Henry’s skin was developing a red sheen. His unblinking eyes were dry and tinged with brown specks, like overcooked egg whites.

That’s when I called the sheriff.

The grizzled southerner and his doe-eyed deputy arrived quickly, seeing as they were only a three-minute drive down the road. They stood at the base of that pine for an hour, but couldn’t find the language to persuade Henry down either. Flustered and out of patience, the sheriff told us he would involve the fire department tomorrow if Henry remained in the tree.

When night fell, I couldn’t visualize Henry through the telescope anymore. But I could *hear* him. From our bedroom window, faintly sobbing somewhere in the blackness.

I found myself posted up in the den before the sun even rose, my mind burning with curiosity. Black coffee trickled down my throat, warming my marrow. For a moment, I felt ashamed of the excitement rumbling around in my chest.

The more I reflected on the sensation, however, the more I understood it. Journalism used to be my life before the cumulative horrors I documented manifested as a crippling fear of the world. In the grand scheme of things, this stakeout was pathetic. It didn't hold a candle to what I had done before, in a past life. But fascination, not dread, drove me to do it, and that held value.

Henry had not moved from his steeple, and by the time the sun appeared over the horizon, he had stifled his tears. His biceps were red and swollen, likely muscle breakdown from keeping them outstretched in the same position for over twenty-four hours.

A little after eight, Jim made his way downstairs. He was unusually quiet. Initially, I attributed his silence to low-level distress, secondary to Henry’s unexplained behavior. When I finally noticed him, he was standing by the front door, away from the view of our neighbor’s macabre display.

I asked him if he was doing alright, and he replied with an affirmative grunt, so I left him be.

Around noon, I felt a theory crystallize in my skull. Henry was twisting around the tree’s axis with a pace and direction identical to yesterday's. He must be watching something, I thought. That’s when it hit me.

Henry was angling his eyes and his body to constantly face the sun.

My mind scrambled to process this observation, but Jim’s heavy breathing behind me broke my concentration. It scared the shit out of me because I didn’t hear him approach. Startled, I urged him to explain what the hell he was doing.

*“Oh…fixing clock,”* he replied.

Except there was no clock. In actuality, he had his face pressed to the window that was to the right of me. He was staring at something.

I didn’t want to believe it at first. But by the afternoon, I was forced to confront the realization. From where I sat in the den, I could see Henry’s back through the telescope, and when I moved my eye away, I could see Jim’s back, silently gazing forward.

Early that morning, he had been watching the sun rise from our front door, just the same as Henry had from atop the pine tree.

My husband was following the trajectory as well.

Before I could dial 9-1-1, the sheriff and his deputy appeared in my peripheral vision. My burst of relief was short-lived when I observed how they were walking. Their footfalls were languid and protracted, the same as Henry’s had been yesterday.

As their hands contacted two different pine trees in unison, I refocused the telescope on Henry. To my horror, they were not climbing the tree where my neighbor sat to rescue him.

The possessed men were scaling their own trees, each equidistant from Henry’s.

In a state of detached shock, I moved a shaky hand to my notebook to jot down one last detail I had noticed about Henry.

Tiny mushrooms had sprouted from his eye sockets, palms and his open mouth. A robin rested on his forehead, nibbling at the growing fungus.

A wave of primal terror washed over me, and I sprinted from the chair to my front door, pausing as my hand twisted the knob.

I tried to force myself through the threshold. My head pivoted back to Jim for motivation, who hadn’t moved an inch, in spite of the noise of the chair and the telescope crashing to the floor when I sprang up.

Unable to overcome my agoraphobia, I instead sat down on the doormat and placed my head in my hands.

Whatever Henry succumbed to, it had spread to the sheriff, the deputy, and my husband. I contemplated calling 9-1-1, but what if it just spread to emergency medical services as well?

I’m not sure how long I lingered there, catatonic. The blood-chilling wails of my husband returned my consciousness to my body.

It had become night.

The absence of natural light had made Jim into a messy human puddle on the kitchen floor.

I tiptoed over to my husband, doing my best to ignore the pangs of terror vibrating in my spine. He had simply crumbled where he stood when the sun set, knelling unnaturally with his chest and torso leaning against the wall below our kitchen window.

Despite knowing he wasn’t, I asked if he was okay a handful of times, receiving no reply.

Standing over him, I tilted his shoulder, trying to see his face. Jim limply fell over in response. He was still crying softly, eyes open but producing no tears.

That’s when I noticed his chest wasn’t moving.

He wasn’t breathing.

When I found the courage to check, he had no pulse, and I lost consciousness.

I woke up a few hours later.

Through the telescope, I could see my husband perched on a pine tree of his own, arms outstretched and eyes still open. Hellish choreography modeled by Henry, mimicked by the sheriff, the deputy, and Jim.

My current theory is as follows: Henry must have accidentally unearthed something old and terrible digging holes in his backyard. A parasitic fungus lying dormant under the soil, infecting everyone who went near with inhaled spores once it was exposed.

I’m going to make it outside today. I'll grab a shovel from the garage, and I'll fill every single hole Henry made with layers of soil. Maybe I’ll survive uninfected, but I suspect I will succumb to whatever this thing is as well.

But it’s the least I can do to honor Jim’s memory.

I’m taking the time to document and post this for two reasons.

First and foremost, don’t end up like me. I hid from the world because it felt safer. But it wasn’t safer, it was just easier, and I wasted precious time.

Secondly, if you see anyone perched on a tree, eyes following the trajectory of the sun, burn the tree down or run. Whatever you do, cover your mouth.

Because that robin ate some of the fungus that grew from Henry, and may disseminate the spores as far as it can fly.

The start of its life cycle? It’s unclear, and I think that, unfortunately, the world may have an answer to that question in a few days.

Representative Casseteman: It is madame, we got a message from the fellow camcordermen that one of our units was taken to undergo an experiment...



Cassete Administrator: THEY WHAT!? (she slams her mug on the floor) WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!! WHAT A BUNCH OF MORONS!! THEY LITERALLY THINK THEY CAN TURN OUR KIND INTO THEIR OWN HAMSTERS...



Representative Casseteman: Uh.. umm...



Cassete administrator: Why didnt you consult this to me first, why did nobody here told me and asked permission first, you literally let those mute faceless bastards experiment on-



Some casseteman enters the meeting chamber they are escorting wumbo who was riding a skateboard.



Cassete Administrator: Oh my god!! who is this cute little fella!!\~



Representative Casseteman: Uhm madam... thats the casseteman the administrators experimented at for the tri-soldier program-

Wumbo: I am Wumbo, i was created by the Administrators as a gift for the casseteman faction, i am an experimental supersoldier powered by an essence of the tri-titan. I am half Drill, Microphone and a Casseteman of course!!



Cassete Administrator: Oh look at this little guy your so adorable in that toilet body... if i can only come out of this bunker to hug you... (she keeps pointing at the screen). BUT THIS I AM STILL NOT OKAY WITH THIS WITHOUT MY PERMISSION MR. REPRESENTATIVE!!



Representative: Chill out madame, we didnt even know this happened without our fellow scientists telling us in the alliance base...



Cassete Administrator: You better be right... Anyways wumbo, you should take a rest for now!!



Wumbo: I can't, theres still problems on the frontlines at the moment, Theres a mysterious threat lurking right now, some giant skull looking toilet is rampaging... He killed one of the alliance titans...



Cassete Administrator: Oh my god... That's really sad to hear, who died??



Wumbo: Jr... Last sight i saw is this skull guy killed him...



Large Casseteman: Guys, you might want to see this...



He showed a recording and footage of Jr. being possesed with his screen being all green, rampaging a town with him standing on one foot, he kills the pov with a green screen along with some other alliance members.



Large Casseteman: He's one of them now...



Cassete Administrator: We cant let more alliance members die from the hands of this titan... Send more Medics and rescue to the frontlines, Little guy, I trust you to be a brave and reliable soldier, Get to the frontlines and fight back, goodluck little guy!!



Wumbo: Thank you ms. lady administrator...



Cassete Administrator: Now if you'll excuse me, i have to clean this mug and make myself coffee... I can't concentrate properly without one... до свидания!!

the tvmen see something terrifying..

with a tv screen they stare at the undead titan televisionman using his jetpackt of fly as necromancer used his body to destroy entire buildings off the speaker toilets before turning the tv off...titan tvman was still turned off in the ground

  
scientist tvman looked at everyone before speaking: well have to turn him on later but for now we need to discuss this without titan tvman freaking out....what exactly happened?

  
titan camera toilet: i have no idea...he suddenly turned off as a tv came out of his body growing some legs and attaching itself to him to teleport away and since i was so close due to the buble shield i was teleported away too..if i had stayed titan televisionman wouldnt have died! someone must of done it on purpose!

  
scientist tvman: and chief tvman has gone missing -\_- and two normal tvmen along with blademan...this is getting ridicolous atleast a lot of normal tvmen are looking for the pink core tho they have started to go missing too..

  
polycephaly: WHO CARES! ITS MORE THAN OBVIOUS! OUR CHIEF! THAT PIECE OF SHIT GOES MISSING AS SOON AS THIS HAPPENS!

  
tvwoman: or the traitor is here.

  
female tv toilet: ho nyooow <:C

  
poly toilet: IM GONNA SHOVE THOSE CLAWS OF HIS UP HIS A-

  
scientist tvman: no reason for that getting anxious wont get us anywhere we need to try and find the cause of this we are at our lowest hour and we cant fight each other. i suggest taking charge for now i dont trust titan tvman to have the right mind set at the time especially after losing his two brothers that necromancer and the uber toilets ARE a threath the skibidi alliance was already known for having VARIOUS titans but thet toilet empire has started to do it too

  
tvwoman: wait! is chief speakerman alright?

boombox the speaker juggernaut stood in the hospital room as he saw the chief speakerman...a medic cameraman stood next to him and spoke ¨im sorry...there wasnt much we could do¨ a doctor casseteman next to him was also quite sadenned by this

  
¨we want to give you some time before we bury him later...especially for chief speaker toilet please take your time..¨ they leave the room as boombox looks at the dead chief speakerman in the hospital bed his lights? all gone.

https://preview.redd.it/9jk6laiwo9ae1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ff8c651ab5fb3a8d2354a0ac778b4d9bfec4bd4

boombox laid his head after analyzing the dead chief speakerman:

  
this makes no sense....the administrators told me my system makes no mistakes...yet hes here dead....if i was programmed better he would not be dead...yet he is now...but thats not my fault..ITS THEIRS....why? why couldnt they make me better? THIS MAKES NO SENSE! I WAS SUPPOSE TO HAVE YOU BE PROUD OF ME! YET YOU DINT EVEN KNOW ME TOO MUCH BEFORE YOU DIED!!!

  
he punched the wall in frustation leaving  a crack

  
boombox: im so sorry....

  
**CUT TO BLACK,TRANSITION TO NEXT SCENE**

>**speakerman base - brazil - eternal darkness (night)**

  
we see the vision of the chief speaker toilet tho..we see him when he was a human he was blonde wearing a rock shirt with short sleeves and some long pants..however a sudden cut of black happens and when it comes back up we see him as a skibidi toilet....then the cut to black is even more abrupt...and he wakes up as a speaker toilet! slowly opening his eye before..

  
we come back to the real world! chief speaker toilet wakes up in his bed..there was a book about the famous cameraman die yang who made a book about how violent both sides can be...a phisolophy book basically he also had a lot of rock instruments on his room before getting off bed  putting his suit on before hes catched off guard by someone literally FLOTING in his room

https://preview.redd.it/0esd2jpn1aae1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=713bea6485e662675a0a75297fe36e19fcc322b0

it was a purple man! ew! a human? what is he doing here? he falls to the ground inmeadtly:  


¨WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?¨ he asked and the man called agent x laughed to himself before talking:

  
¨i know how much you want change chief speaker toilet so i will give you the tool to make that change happen.¨ he snaps his fingers and suddenly green electricity appears in the air out of nowhere as a regular looking magnum appears from it chief speaker toilet catching it on his hands

  
¨WHAT?!!¨ he asked and agent x waved him bye bye ¨thats all i needed to tell you youll see how this helps later.¨ green electricity spreads on his own body as he dissapears teleporting away or becoming invisible? either way you get the deal

  
¨what the hell was that?¨ he asked he decides to hide the gun on the pocket of his suit  


before he hears a knock on the door

  
he opens and he sees detective cameraman!

https://preview.redd.it/wd6olgys0aae1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea40028ee3f3bee36b397c01869e12988bd52bf9

he tips his hat to salute him as chief speaker toilet talks:

  
this is about the meeting right?

  
detective cameraman: yes..im sorry about what happened with your brother..

  
chief speaker toilet: .....i.....its fine...im sure the dronemen have an explination! it will be okay!

  
detective cameraman: i gotta go check another case but just i just got a question-

  
chief speaker toilet: sorry i dont have the time

  
he walks past detective cameraman before the latter opens his hand to him while speaking:

  
wait sir-

  
chief speaker toilet: discussions are happening over dinner.

  
he enters a room...full of speaker toilets and speakermen tho there was WAY more speaker toilets in the main course of that room there was three chairs one for each chief that would be on his meeting already waiting for him was a chief droneman and scienitst chief droneman as he slowly walked every speaker in the room looked to him before he goes to his own chair and sits

  
we suddenly cut to another point in time detective cameraman was outside the base returning from the mission he just had jumping out of the helicopter landing safely as he rushes past anyone wanting to ask him questions he was sweating the lights in all the rooms were turned off so it made for an anxious but fitting tone to what he was approaching as he made it to the door that would lead to the room

  
Detective cameraman: nobody except those people were in that room...where ALL that happened i need to see what occured there...

  
we cut to the past back to where we left off all chiefs sitted on their chairs and after a quick annoucement of what they were doing they began the talk with each other

  
chief speaker toilet took a deep breath before talking: im just here to appreciate the amount of trade routes weve set up after the catastrophy that all was..it meant a lot even from the dronemen

  
Chief droneman: see? this guy isnt so bad.

  
Chief scientist droneman: im not convinced.

  
chief speaker toilet collects his cool taking a deep breath before talking again: but there is something we gotta discuss.....everyone was there..yet you werent you dronemen were present for almost everything except this. and you cant say you dint know because crimson and a lot of people knew what was happening yet you all never once sended any units to help us..

  
the speaker toilets in the room were sweating and the speakermen were as well as chief scientist droneman looks around before speaking: UGH.....look a lot of those choices were by bulwark and arcadia..crimson wanted to help a lot of people did..but i dint..

  
chief speaker toilet:...WHY?...

  
chief scientist droneman: because i was not gonna waste my units in lost causes. is it that hard to believe?

  
chief speaker toilet: when the cameraman was being attacked you still helped...why is this not the case?

  
chief scientist droneman: ......well..its because you guys are dif-

  
CHIEF DRONEMAN: SCIENTIST NO-

  
all the audience screams beofre chief scienitst droneman changes his phrasing

  
chief scientist droneman: because the cameramen are more like us...you cant expect us to be accostumed to some hardware head with toilets for heads! do you know how weird that sounds? wumbo only has droneman parts on him because we still wanted to help the alliance but cmon-

  
chief speaker toilet: NO! thats not fair!!!! it sounds A LOT like you just have a bias and you dont wanna say it.

  
chief scientist droneman: sorry but this discussion is getting dumb

  
chief droneman: would you like to work a little closer to home sir?

  
chief scientist droneman: of course lets go!

  
him and the other chief get up but before they could walk away someone spoke up as they stood up

  
¨no!¨ green electricity for a few seconds as he said that

  
they turn to see chief speaker toilet being the one who had stood up breathing heavily and basically stopping them from walking away of the discussion with how much he demanded that

  
chief speaker toilet: youve never aknowledged so many things..you always have ignored them...the massacre done on camera toilets by your people? you never spoke once. the amount of toilet citizens youve killed from the skibidi alliance? youve never bothered even counting their numbers..

  
we come back to the present yet we can still hear the discussion they were having at that moment detective cameraman enters the room..dark with the lights seemingly shot by a gun he saw corpses of specific alliance members of all races EXCEPT speakermen and speaker toilets a she searched and searched we hear that conversation

  
¨AND HOW IS THAT MY FAULT?!!! SOUNDS LIKE YOU JUST LOVE TO PLAY VICTIM!¨

  
¨BECAUSE I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU COULD OF DONE TO HELP BUT YOU JUST DONT CARE! BECAUSE YOUR PRECIOUS BEHEMOTH COULDNT BE RISKED HUH?¨

  
¨YOU WANTED OUR TITAN DEAD? THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO!¨

  
¨SO OUR TITAN DESERVED TO BE KILLED INSTEAD?!! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU¨

  
the detective cameraman looked around speaking to himself ¨**we all dont know what got discussed..**¨ he grabs a magnum in the ground moving it to see it had all bullets on it gone along with the bullets in the groun

  
we go back to the past chief speaker toilet breathes heavily...green electricity on his body as he begins to see memories...regaining them...chief scientist dronemna...he was the one who killed him when he was a skibidi toilet.....yet he never told him ANYTHING... he looks around...

  
chief scientist droneman: HA HA...wait a moment...youve never  been helping in the battlefield at all! what do you have to praise for? youre not like your brother! you all here are so WEAK-

  
chief droneman: scientist please stop youre-

  
chief speaker toilet: and i want what i got back.

  
he turns his back to him his fist closed

  
**¨when you got skin in the game you stay in the game but you dont get a win unless you play in the game...HO you get LOVE for it you get HATE for it but you dont get anything unless you...¨**

  
¨WAIT FOR IT WAIT FOR IT WAIT!!!¨ the audience says genuinely moved by what he was saying

  
chief speaker toilet moves around the place talking moving his hands in very expressive ways as he spoke:

  
**¨GOD HELP ME FORGIVE ME I WANNA BUILD SOMETHING THATS GONNA OUTLIVE ME!¨**

  
the voices in his head get louder and louder his red eye switches to green as green electricity surrounds him they all scream at him in different volumes and it drives his head mad before they all finally stop and he opens his eye...

  
everything changes and he sees a better future he sees every speaker in that room with either mechanical limbs or new suits he sees one on himself....he even sees boombox juggernaut there.... he sees a huge poster in the place they found themselves at...a poster for something called ¨genesis¨

  
¨i.....wanna be in the room where it happens..¨  
  
¨the room where it happens...¨  
  
¨the room where it happens...¨  
  
¨i....wanna be in the room where it happens¨  
  
¨the room where it happens¨

  
he keeps switching between reality and these illusions..yet they dont feel like that..they feel like a vision of the future...the voices in his head get louder

¨i.........wanna be in....the room WHERE IT HAPPENS...IIII¨ (i wanna be in the rooms where it happens the room where it happens the room where it happens)

  
the background begins to get disorted it all becomes green and incapable of being understood as he begins to fall 

¨Ï WANNA BE IN THE ROOM HOOOOooooooooo... I WANNA BE IN...I WANNA BE IN,I GOT TO BE,I GOT TO BE IN THE THRONE ROOM! THAT BIG OL ROOOOOOM!¨

  
chief speaker toilet begins to lose it holding his face

  
the audience begins to cheer him up while speaking their throughs what they think was almost on synch due to how close they felt to each other and what chief speaker toilet was trying to say the message he was trying to give without him even realizing tho part of this was also a dramatic version of how he was seeing things at the moment

  
¨OUR NEEDS ARE COMPROMISED!¨ they spoke

  
¨HOLD YOUR NOSE AND CLOSE YOUR EYES¨ we see representation of what chief speaker toilet thinks the administrators telling anyone to keep silence to not do anything that points out the mistakes in their own system telling everyone to ignore the massacres theyve commited for more power

  
¨WE WANNA LEAD US TO SAVE THE DAY!¨ the audience speaks fist in the air

  
¨YET WE DONT GET A SAU IN WHAT THEY TRADE AWAY!¨ chief speaker toilet speaks to the audience his hands out the other two chiefs were sweating a bit from how akward this felt

  
¨WE DREAM OF A BRAND NEW SPOT!¨ they exclaim in anger!

  
¨BUT WE DREAM IN THE DARK FOR THE MOST PART!!!!¨ chief speaker toilet tells them releasing that anger that hes contained in his voice he begins to hear those voices as he begins to talk to himself

  
¨DARK HAS A TUNE WHERE IT HAPPENS- I GOT TO BE IN THE ROOM!!! HOOOOO¨

  
he can hear and see someone who nobody else could see a hallucination of sorts as he sees agent x floating around him

  
¨I GOT TO BE!¨ he exclaims in need  


agent x: in the room where it happens

  
¨I GOT TO BE!!¨ he exclaims even more

  
AGENT X: **IN THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENS**

  
¨I GOT TO BE IN THE ROOM¨ (**the room where it happens**)

  
¨I GOTTA BE I GOTTA BE I GOTTA BE¨ (**the room where it happens**)  
  
  
he looks at his hands shaking before putting his hand on the pocket of his suit 

  
¨IN THE ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM¨ (**i wanna be in the room where it happens!**)

  
he pulls out of his pocket THE GUN and he points it at him this all happens in one split second and for a frame of a second you could see agent x holding his hand to point **\*CLICK\* \*BOOM\***

  
***\*BANG\****

  
....

  
yeah that was a shitty musical :/ anyhow...were on the present and we see detective cameraman....he sees in the stage where that magnum was shot...the dead scientist chief droneman and chief droneman in the ground...both dead...bullet holes on their bodies he shot more than once...seemingly insulting them as he did so and the speaker toilets cheered when he did it..

  
detective cameraman was weirded out by one thing the most...a note....on the dead body of the chief scientist droneman..yet it dint seem like a note chief speaker toilet left behind...it was something else..a note from someone else



¨if you want your loved ones to be safe...stop chasing for me or you will receive consequences like these detective,you will never catch me :)¨ agent x had left behind a message for detective cameraman who holds the note in anger...what does this all mean?...



**that day when chief speaker toilet did that shot....it gave everyone inspiration to rebell agaisnt the alliance and the administrators...every single speaker toilet left along with SOME speakermen leaving the area.....the way he sayed ¨FUCK YOU¨ to their dead corpses as he shot them...it was weirdly satisfying**

  
**this is how it happened.**

1hqsykc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hqsykc/confused_by_a_mutually_agreed_to_friendzone/,Confused by a mutually agreed to friendzone ,"TL;Dr: I have only recently started working on my social life as I was prevented from if by my mental health earlier and met a guy who agreed to being ""just friends"" but is now giving me mixed signals


I (29F) have some pretty severe mental health issues. In very broad strokes I have been on survival mode pretty much my whole life until May 2024 when I finally quit my toxic job and out of sheer desperation and exhaustion finally managed to go to the psychiatrist, get diagnosed and started medication. 

I am a huge music lover and I generally try to attend as many shows as possible but wasn't able to truly participate in the scene bc of my mental state. Since I started medication it has become significantly easier for me to function and I finally feel, for the first time in my life, that I can actually even think somewhat coherently.
I am now quite active in the local underground metal scene and this is where I met this guy. He was the organiser of one of the shows I attended and he first came up to me when I was smoking outside (Late September 2024) He introduced himself and complimented my haircut. The conversation was good, we talked about music, he told me he makes perfume and so on. The conversation was good and between every show (there were four bands) when I came out to smoke he would talk to me (as he was standing at the door selling tickets all night) after the show was over he asked me if I'd like to come over for an after-party so he could play me some records. Now, I know this sounds risky, but I genuinely didn't get any strange or dangerous vibes from him and I went with him. He made me tea and we talked more and listened to records. While this was happening he told me he hadn't meet someone who was so enthusiastic about music in a looong time. He also told me at some point that he's really loves my look (I have a pretty unusual sense of style). It was around 3AM when I said I was gonna go and he was insisting I stay and ensuring me he wouldn't do anything to me (it wasn't creepy I genuinely felt completely safe the whole time) but I insisted on going as I had left my meds at home. He was pretty disappointed so I offered to come eat breakfast with him the next morning. 


True to my word, I came to breakfast the next day and he was actually pleasantly surprised because he thought it was just an excuse. I ended up staying the majority of the day and we listened to more music and watched a movie. I also brought my favourite record as I don't have a record player and we listened to it whole and he also gifted me a protective sleeve to put the record in as I didn't have one. 
Next week, I invited him to my flat for coffee after work as he drives by my house to get back from his office. He came over and ended up staying until 10pm and once again we had a great time, just talking and listening to music. I was going on a business trip abroad a day later and told him i was struggling with packing. After he arrived home that evening he called me and basically forced me to pack while talking to him. 
All this time we're also texting continuously and he's very responsive and always replies, he actually texts first most of the time. 
When I was on my trip we also texted continuously and had one phonecall as well. 


When I came back I was out of the city going to a concert and we also talked pretty much continuously. At some point the conversation went to us talking about being mutually sexually attracted to each other (I started this conversation). I forget the exact timeline but at some point within that conversation or in the following days he told me he got out of an 8 year long relationship pretty recently and he wasn't looking go date. I said I understand but I'm not interested in anything casual so let's be friends. He agreed. 
At some point later he invited me to dinner after work at his house and I went. He also suggested I bring an overnight bag to sleepover and go to work from there but I declined. During that dinner he told me he thought he owed me an apology because he thought that he gave me the idea he was going to ask me out and wanted to clear the air. We also had some conversations about sexuality as I am still a virgin and have some childhood trauma in that aspect which caused me to be pretty much asexual, but I am conceptually interested in intimacy and would like to explore it. 


I went to the next gig he was organising and after he asked me if I wanted to come over to listen to records but I said I was on my period and didn't have enough pads with me. He said he could find some pads at home for me. 
So I went to the after party at his house with him and his friend. After his friend had a little too much to drink he fell asleep downstairs so we went to hang out in his bedroom. Now, I was sitting at the foot of the bed petting the cat and he was laying down. Suddenly, he grabs me from behind by the waist and pulls me into a spooning position. I ask him what he's doing and he says ""he needs serotonin from human contact"" which I felt okay about as he genuinely just hugged me with no weird touching or anything. He's tipsy at this point and he's a sad drunk, as I discovered by then so I figured he was just sad. We just lay there like that for a while and talked about casual stuff. Finally I said I had to get going and he once again insisted I stay and that he wouldn't do anything to me. I once again denied and it's important I never had to tell him twice, he would accept my denial. As was our ritual at this point I offered to come to breakfast the next day. We chilled on the couch and at some point he puts his head in my lap and I end up petting his head and stroking his back for quite a long time. Then I leave around 6pm for another concert I was attending.
November was pretty busy and we tried making coffee plans but we both kept having scheduling issues so didn't meet for about 3 weeks. The next time we met I came over to his house and once again he lay on my lap. 
That was about 3 weeks ago and we haven't seen each other since bc Christmas and all that. 


Now, there have been instances between those meetings when he would call me on FaceTime and say that he was just telling his friends about me and they wanted to see me (they were hanging out at the time) and this happened multiple times with different friends. He also mentioned many times in conversations how he was telling someone about me and something something. 


On New Year's Eve he FaceTimed me at 1AM and said that he was telling his friends about me and they asked if I wanted to come over to the party. I asked why he didn't invite me earlier and he said I was meant to be at a gig which was true (I didn't go because I ran out of meds over Christmas and wasn't feeling up to it) I ended up rejecting the invitation because the cabs were too expensive at that hour. 


Now, there are few things I need to mention. He still lives with his ex. She's in the process of moving abroad to her new man (idk if she cheated or met him after they broke up but from context I decuded she cheated). I can very obviously see how difficult this situation is for him because his mental state is very dramatically declining when she's here (she goes abroad to her man for about two weeks out of every month). He often drinks to deal with his emotions and I can clearly see this situation is overwhelming to him. When he's drunk he often slips up and says things like ""this is going to be embarrassing but I literally adore talking to you"" or mentions something about creating a perfect date for me. I am pretty confused by this so I often stop replying to his texts but he texts me everyday out of his own initiative regardless of whether I reply or not. If I don't reply a lot he also just sends me lots of reels and then is suspicious/worried and asks where I am if I don't reply for a day for example. 

 I apologise if this is very simple to understand, but as I mentioned I am a virgin and I pretty much never had a real social life up until I started meds. I know this is tricky because I'm basically 30 just starting to learn how the adult world actually works, but that's why I'd appreciate any insight anyone might have. I don't have the experience and I genuinely enjoy this guy's company so I don't want to be unfair to him or to myself by my lack of knowledge.

So my question is, is he interested in me?",0,1735695523.0,relationships,1,0.5,False
1hqsxld,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1hqsxld/looking_for_ideas/,Looking for ideas,"Hi all. I have had some bad GERD issues going on for about 18 months now. Last April I had an insane heart rate increase and thought it was a heart attack. I went to the ER and was told it was GERD and was given a GI cocktail. I switched from Omeprazole to Pantoprazole and thought that was working but was still having the on again off again chest pains and heart rate increases. I had a scope and was told I had H Pylori and was given a ton of medicine and was told it cleared.

I again had the chest pains and increased heart rate. I believe this was causing blood pressure increases and was put on meds for it. I went back to the GI doc and was told to switch back to Omeprazole and had another scope a couple of weeks ago. I am currently awaiting feedback for it but it looked ok.

I have limited my alcohol and coffee intake but it doesn’t seem to make a difference. Something I’ve noticed since switching to Omeprazole is burping. I seem to do it a lot more than I remember with Pantoprazole. I miss the old Zantac (Ranitidine). It seemed to work. 

Any suggestions from anyone out there? I’m tired of dealing with it. I’m always on edge because of gas issues and feel like I’m going to have a heart attack even though that’s been ruled out. Thank you in advance. ",2,1735695423.0,GERD,3,1.0,False

","Happy New Year, everyone! 🎉

My mother and I will be visiting Vietnam from January 14 to January 22. I've taken the lead on planning our itinerary and have done quite a bit of research on activities and sights to see. I’ve gathered suggestions from various sources and mapped everything out on Google Map to find out which places are close together. While I don’t plan to force ourselves to visit everything—especially if my mom gets tired—it’s nice to have a plan in place. That said, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed and worry that I might have overlooked something.

I feel like I’ve packed a lot into our time in Hanoi while keeping the last two days more relaxed. If you have any recommendations for places to add or remove, I’d love your input! Also, does anyone know how much tours in Ninh Binh typically cost? The only tours I found on Klook start from Hanoi, but I've already booked our accommodations in Ninh Binh.

  
Oh and if you have any recommendations of things to try and buy! I'd like to buy a few things for family and friends.

Thanks so much!",2,1735695336.0,VietNam,0,1.0,False

1hqswia,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1hqswia/am_i_getting_played/,Am I Getting Played? ,"This is a lot, but I need every detail included. This was the only time I've ever felt genuine love toward another human being, and I'm still really processing it and can't think clearly. I appreciate anything, and love you all. 

I (28M) dated a woman (24F) four years ago very briefly. It was a great date, but she was in the process of moving to another state, and so we broke things off. 

Last May, we reconnect via dating app while she's visiting family. She lives 4 hours away. We hit it off immediately as friends, talk over the phone several hours a week, write each other letters, say a""I love you/goodnight, etc."" Things feel intimate, and they send very NSFW pictures from time to time, albeit without inappropriate conversation around them. 

Then, out of the blue, she gets back with an awful ex, and so I state my feelings towards the ex and my romantic feelings. We then don't talk for about a month until I receive a 3 page handwritten letter. She broke up with her ex, and we go back to the way things were, ""sweet dreams"" ""I love you"" becoming almost daily. 

September - I start seeing someone unexpectedly, but break things off and tell her about it. Within 24 hours, she says she's going to be in town for the holidays and wants to stay with me for a week. Not her family, not her childhood friends, me. I agree. She says she's not going to date anyone for several months.

Mid-November - ghosts me. We hadn't gone 24 hours without talking outside of when she got with her ex. She finally texts after 11 days, saying she started and then lost her dream job and wasn't talking to anyone at all. No more ""Sweet dreams"" or ""I love you"" from her, and even when she does text, she never reciprocates my goodnight or love texts. 

Xmas- She arrives, and immediately tells me she has a boyfriend who she started seeing in mid November (Right when she ghosted). I'm heartbroken, shocked, and don't understand, but play along as a friend for two days and genuinely have the time of my life. It was amazing. Her boyfriend knew she's staying with me (but perhaps doesn't know our history.), and seems like a boring guy who ""doesn't like movies or read books."". In contrast, I'm a published author and well-established artist obsessed with nerdy media like she is. 

Yesterday - I go out and get her coffee and make breakfast, but she's suddenly distant when, the night before, we had an amazing time and she was so lively. I tell her that I still have romantic feelings, and that I don't understand why she didn't tell me she had a boyfriend , and that I originally assumed she was visiting to test the waters since she's looking to possibly move back here.

She seems shocked, says she NEVER had romantic feelings toward me, and just didn't think to tell me about the boyfriend in all the chaos of her life. I ask if there was anything about me that turned her off dating, and she said nothing. She goes on to tell me that she doesn't understand why anyone would want to date her, then tells me how amazing I am and that I'll ""find someone more compatible."" We hug for several minutes. I cry, we say ""I love you"". 

She tells me that she'll leave if it's too much to have her here with me, and I tell her that I need a few minutes. She says she wants to go outside in the sun, and I hear her make a phone call. When she returns, I say I'd love for her to stay, but she says she has to go back because she's ""homesick."" We hug again, say mushy stuff, and she drives away. 

End.


Does it seem like I'm getting played? Was I Plan B? Did she really think we were just friends and I misread things, I mean, she's autistic (so am I)?  

I'm at a complete loss, and everything really hurts right now. I haven't talked to her since except for her letting me know she got home safely.",1,1735695319.0,dating,9,0.67,False

1hqsssd,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1hqsssd/they_werent_wet_were_they/,"they weren’t wet, were they?","My name’s Walt Kelly, and I been sittin’ on this story ‘bout a remote lighthouse off the Oregon coast for nigh on thirty-five years now. Figgered it’s time to let it loose, like a bad smell at a Sunday picnic, probly.

The lighthouse. The Widow's Tooth, some of the old-timers called it. And she’d earned it, they said. More storms rolled over that rock than you’ve had hot dinners. Old timers used to say the place was cursed, that the souls of shipwrecked sailors was trapped in the lantern room, forever watchin’ for a shore they could never reach. Just stories, mostly. Keeps the tourists interested though.

Worked that light for twelve years, I did. Seen every kind of weather the Pacific could throw, every kind of boat that dared to come close. You learn to read the water out there, know the sound of a trawler from a sailboat a mile off. Seen things you wouldn’t believe, mostly just the ocean bein’ the ocean, mind you. But this… this was different.

It was a night just like any other in late fall. The kind where the wind howled like a banshee lost in a barrel, and the waves crashed high enough to spit water right up onto the lantern room. Couldn’t see nothin’ but white fury out there. Radar was spittin’ and cracklin’, pickin’ up nothin’ but the storm itself, and I figgered that was that. You get used to the loneliness out there, the constant roar of the sea your only company. You settle into a rhythm, checkin’ the lamp, the gauges, makin’ sure Widow's Tooth was doin’ her job, warnin’ folks away from the teeth of that rock.

Then, clear as a bell over the roar, I heard it. A knock. Not a bang from the wind, nothin’ like that. A proper knock. Like someone standin’ there, polite as you please, in the middle of Armageddon.

Figgered it was the wind playin’ tricks, but then it came again. Three sharp raps. No boat coulda made it close that night without me seein’ it, hearin’ it. And even if they did… they’d be clingin’ to life, not standin’ there knockin’ like they was expectin’ tea and biscuits.

I went down the windin’ stairs, heart thumpin’ a little faster than usual. Bolted the heavy door open, and there they was. A fella, his wife, and two young’uns, huddled together. Seemed normal enough at first glance. Except… they was dry. Bone dry. Like they’d just stepped out of their parlor on a sunny afternoon. Their clothes, looked like wool, but felt… papery, almost. Rain usually soaks things. And their hair, the rain shoulda plastered it to their heads, but it was dry, like it hadn't even been near water.

“Lost, are you?” I asked, the wind tryin’ to rip the words from my mouth.

The fella, he had a thin mustache and a nervous look, just nodded. “Storm caught us out,” he said, his voice barely a whisper against the wind. The wife, she had her arm around a little girl, maybe six or seven, and the boy, a couple years older, was holdin’ onto his daddy’s coat.

“No boat,” I said, lookin’ past ‘em into the storm. “Ain’t seen no boats all night.”

The fella just shrugged, a weak little shrug that didn’t explain nothin’. I wasn’t born yesterday. You don’t just appear on a rock in the middle of the ocean during a gale.

“Come on in,” I said, more out of habit than anything. Couldn’t leave folks out in that.

They stepped inside, and the wind seemed to sigh now that the door was shut. They dripped nothin’ on the floor. Not a single drop. I’d just mopped the floor that afternoon, the linoleum still a bit slick. They stepped inside, and nothin'. Not a bead of water. I remember thinkin' I needed to check the desiccant in the lamp housing later, keep the moisture out. But that dryness… it wasn't right.

“Coffee?” I offered, pointin’ to the pot always brewin’ on the stove. Strong enough to float a damn horseshoe.

They nodded, still quiet. The young’uns, a boy and a girl, they didn’t say nothin’, just stood there, clingin’ to their mama’s skirts.

It was the way they looked at you though. The wife, she’d smile, a real polite smile, but her eyes… her eyes would drift off, lookin’ past you, like she was seein’ somethin’ on the wall behind you that wasn’t there. The fella, he mostly kept his head down, but every now and then, he’d glance up, a quick, dartin’ look, then back down again. Like he was expectin’ somethin’ to jump out.

And then there was the peekin’. The little girl, she’d stand in a doorway, just out of sight, just her eyes peekin’ around the jamb, starin’ at you with that same fixed smile. Or the husband, he’d be sittin’ by the fire, but you’d catch him lookin’ over his shoulder, starin’ at the shadows in the corner. The firelight dancin’ on the walls, makin’ shapes.

They didn’t act like they’d just escaped a watery grave. No shiverin’, no cryin’, nothin’. Just… there. And they stayed dry. Even sittin’ by the fire, their clothes didn’t steam, didn’t even look damp. It was unnatural.

Started with a glance here and there, easy enough to miss. But then it got… coordinated. Like they'd rehearsed it. I'd be jawin' with the fella about the wind, tryin' to act normal, and then, all at once, the wife and kids, they'd all turn. Every one of 'em, eyes locked on you for a heartbeat. Then, just as sudden, they'd snap away, lookin' at the floor or the wall, like nothin' happened. Creeped me right out. Like I'd missed somethin', like they knew somethin' I didn't. Made the hairs on my neck prickle, I tell you what.

Once, I went up to check the lamp, hearin' the beam whir and swing out over the black water. When I came back down, they was all just… standin' there, smack-dab in the middle of the room, heads tilted back, gazin' up at the ceilin'. Just starin'. Ceilin's just a ceilin', ain't nothin' special about it. But they was lookin' like they seen somethin' I couldn't. Cleared my throat, and their heads snapped down quick, like they was pulled by a string. Smilin'. That same damn smile that didn't reach their eyes. Like nothin' was amiss.

My mind was tryin’ to make sense of it, tellin’ me I was just tired, seein’ things. But that feelin’… that cold knot in your gut… that don’t lie. I’d seen things out on the water, things you can’t explain, but this was different. This felt… wrong.

It hit me when I saw the little girl walk right through a puddle of seawater on the floor by the door. Didn’t even ripple the water. That’s when the cold really set in. That’s when I knew somethin’ wasn’t right, somethin’ was deeply, terribly wrong.

I’d been watchin’ the wife help the little boy with his coat. Just a normal thing, a mother and her son. But the way she smiled down at him… it was too wide, too fixed. And his eyes… they was lookin’ past her, lookin’ right through her. And somethin’ just clicked. That wasn’t her. And them weren’t her children. Not anymore, anyway.

Come mornin', the wind was done howlin', the sea was almost... polite. Sun shinin' like butter wouldn't melt. They were gone. Just... gone. I stood there, feelin' the silence pressin' in. My gaze kept driftin' back to the door. Solid. And the bolt. That thick brass bolt, still in place. I know that bolt. Know it like I know my own hands. You gotta be here, on this side, to slide it across. Feel the click as it locks. There's no reachin' it from out there. No way. So how...? No wet tracks. Nothin' disturbed. Just the memory of their faces... and that damn bolt.

Never saw ‘em again. Never heard nothin’ ‘bout a missin’ family. The sea keeps its secrets, and sometimes, it spits things back that ain’t what they used to be.

So, if you’re ever caught out in a storm, and someone comes to your door lookin’ for shelter… look real close. Especially if they’re dry as a bone when they shouldn’t be. And if they start starin’ at the corners of the room, smilin’ that empty smile… bolt the door. Let the storm rage. Because sometimes, the sea ain’t the only thing that washes ashore. It brings other things too. Things you don't want to see. Things that ain't natural.",1,1735694958.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

Hi All,

Hope you're having a lovely day :)

having a little trouble getting World of Warcraft classic running on Linux Mint.

anything I have been able to find online says i should just install Lutris and then run the World of Warcraft classic script there and it should work no issue.

I have done that and i am getting the error in the screenshot attached.

I have done the following.

\- Fresh install of Linux Mint

\- Installed latest proprietary NVIDIA Driver.

\- Installed Lutris

\- Searched for wow classic installer and let it install [Battle.net](http://Battle.net)

\- Installed wow classic via Battle.net.

Once i click play is when i get that error.

uploaded screenshot of the error and my system specs.

This is on my laptop (Alienware M15). Did the exact same process on my desktop and had no issues.

Has anyone come across this and know a possible workaround or something i may have missed?

Thanks anyone for any help :) If you need any more info please let me know.

However, around 23 to 24, I decided to slow down and focus on myself, especially after dealing with depression and the loss of my father. Now that I’m in a better place, I’m ready to get back into dating.

Online dating hasn’t worked for me, so I’ve shifted my focus to meeting people in person. The challenge is that where I live, there aren’t many social events or clubs. We only have one or two beer-only bars, and I’ve been avoiding alcohol due to personal reasons and my medication.

I’ve usually avoided hitting on people at work because it feels unprofessional, but it seems like my options are limited. Interestingly, my confidence is still intact when it comes to complimenting men—I used to be bi, and giving basic compliments helps me build myself up again.

Today, I went for coffee with my friend Ryleigh at Barnes & Noble, which is a combination coffee shop and bookstore. I go there almost daily, so it’s likely I’ll see the same staff, including this cute barista I felt was out of my league. I complimented her on her nose, which she seemed to appreciate. While I was ordering, Ryleigh mentioned to her that we were just friends, and I confirmed it directly. After that, the barista’s demeanor changed, and she seemed more engaged.

At that point, she noticed the book I had with me, even though it was face down, and asked if it was Ninth House. I told her it was, and she started recommending a book she was reading, which I ended up buying. At one point, I even asked her if she wanted to chat more about recommendations since I don’t read often. She started saying yes, but Ryleigh unintentionally shifted the conversation before I could follow through. Even if that hadn’t happened, I froze and didn’t know how to ask for her number.

Now I’m wondering how I can recover this situation since I’ll likely see her again at Barnes & Noble. How do I approach her smoothly? And even beyond this situation, how can I build my confidence for future interactions?",1,1735694597.0,datingadviceformen,8,1.0,False

I use zero water with TWW light roast, I have a gooseneck and a good scale, and I buy only specialty beans from reputable roasters. My cups are generally pretty good to great (sometimes), but I'm super interested in a specific pourover grinder. 

Just wondering if anyone else here has made a similar jump and if they think it'll be worth the money. I have zero interest in espresso, and only ever make cold brew if it isn't a pourover.

My name is Daniel and I'm a 29-year-old software engineer based here in NYC. I currently live in a studio which I don't love, so I'm looking to move pretty soon, sometime in January or early February. I'm working with a broker who specializes in luxury buildings throughout the city. They tend to be a bit pricey, so usually what they do is take a larger one bedroom and put up a flex wall, so it works as a 2-bedroom. I’ve lived in one before and it works well. The flex wall can go up to the ceiling like a regular wall, and functions as a real wall. I’ve lived in this kind of situation before and can send pics of my old place if you’d like to get a sense of what it looks like. 

I really love living in luxury buildings because they tend to have lots of amenities, like gym, doormen, rooftops, and other things like that. The broker said there should be some inventory once the new year hits (after Jan 2nd), so I’m waiting to hear back from him sometime later this week / early next week. I would prefer to have the true bedroom, so if you don’t mind you would be taking the flex, and paying less. Usually the apartments go for like 4200 or 4300, so split you would be paying closer to 2,100 and I’d be paying 2,300 or something around that. 

A bit about me: In my free time I enjoy exploring the city, going to dinner, the movies, shows, and just generally taking in all the city has to offer. I work in my office in the financial district between 4 and 5 days per week, \~9 hours per day, and in the evenings like going to the gym, meeting up with friends, or just having a nice lounge night in with some TV. I’m pretty friendly and easy-going, and am looking for a roommate who is similar. I’ve had many roommates over the years, and it’s always been a pleasant experience for me.

1hqsnes,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hqsnes/food_history_when_or_why_did_salad_switch_from/,Food history: when or why did salad switch from after the main dish to a starter in American dining?,"About a century ago, from the children's books I've been reading and menus I've seen from fancy restaurants to railcars to recommendations for housewives, ""salad"" was something eaten after the main dish and was usually some kind of mayonnaise thing (maybe gelatin, maybe not, but not necessarily based around fresh, uncooked leafy greens).

But now, a salad is pretty much always a starter course and any gelatin or mayo-based thing (like ""tuna salad"" or jello salad) is a linguistic relic.

I'm sure someone must have written about this shift, but I'm not really sure where to look. It seems to have changed around mid-century? I'd love to know more about why salad as a course in a nice meal changed, as well as the shift in what it meant.

(Soup still sits as a starter, and cheese and nuts for afters with coffee or tea, so this seems unique to salad??)",6,1735694418.0,AskHistorians,2,0.88,False

However, I have a perfectionist personality (I guess most of us do here?) and although my coffee tastes good, it doesn't taste as good as the coffee shop where I buy my beans from (Chocolate Fish in Sacramento,CA). The texture of the espresso doesn't seem quite there and the milk is also a little tricky to me with the low power on the steam wand, or is this a skill issue on my part? I can get latte art, but I'd like it to be better.

 I also find the workflow kinda laborious and slow when I'm making multiple drinks when family come to visit. When it's just me and my wife it's fine but anything more than that and it really is a long task. I'd love to be able to pour a shot and steam my milk simultaneously.

Anyway, so those are my main gripes with my current setup. I've done a bit of research and I'm thinking of upgrading to the niche zero and the lelit bianca.

What draws me to the bianca is;

The dual boiler - I'm figuring this will make my workflow a hell of a lot smoother and the steam wand pressure looks fantastic.

The programmable flow control shots - 1, it will be really cool to try out different profiles, but also I'd love to be able to real dial in my regular beans and have repeatable shots from the programming. I feel like the breville is so all over the place with shot consistency that I have to pull a manual shot every time and even then the time it takes to pull varies somewhat, especially when pulling multiple shots.

It looks really nice, let's not pretend that's not a factor.

Plumbable - I think it comes with the kit right? Would be really nice to not have to constantly fill up the water tank.

The thing ""holding"" me back is the cost obviously. This would be a pretty significant investment, one I am willing to make because making coffee each morning really is my happy time. But, in your folks opinion is this an upgrade that is really going to improve my overall enjoyable of the prep and of course the flavour of my coffee?

The niche to me looks like my best option, I like that it's not messy like the df64 for example, looks easy to dial in, really low retention. I'm from the UK originally too so I can probably get family to bring one across next time they come to save on the shipping fees.

Would love input from you all, is there a better option in the price range I'm looking at (both machine and grinder) I'm not considering? Should I just stick with the breville if I'm fairly happy with the results I'm getting, but not quite the cafe quality I really want?

1hqsjqp,https://i.redd.it/s1z6ukzj9aae1.jpeg,Jeni’s Dark Chocolate Ice Cream,"CHOCOLATE SYRUP

1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

⅔ cup brewed coffee

⅔ cup sugar

2 ounces bittersweet chocolate (55% to 70% cacao), finely chopped

ICE CREAM BASE

2 cups whole milk

1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch

1½2 ounces (3 tablespoons) cream cheese, softened

⅛ teaspoon fine sea salt

1 cup heavy cream

½ cup sugar

2 tablespoons light corn syrup

PREP
For the chocolate syrup:

Combine the cocoa, coffee, and sugar in a small saucepan, bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly to dissolve the sugar.

Boil until the syrup begins to bubble (about 10 seconds), then immediately move from the heat, add the chocolate, and let stand for 5 minutes.

Stir the syrup until smooth. Set aside.

For the ice cream base:

Mix about 2 tablespoons of the milk with the cornstarch in a small bowl to make a smooth slurry. 

Whisk the cream cheese, warm chocolate syrup, and salt in a medium bowl until smooth. Fill a large bowl with ice and water.

COOK Combine the remaining milk, the cream, sugar, and corn syrup in a 4-quart saucepan, bring to a rolling boil over medium high heat, and boil for 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the cornstarch slurry. Bring the mixture back to a boil over medium-high heat and cook, stirring with a heatproof spatula, until slightly thick-ened, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat.

CHILL Gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the cream cheese mixture until smooth.

Pour the mixture into a 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bag and submerge the sealed bag in the ice bath. Let stand, adding more ice as necessary, until cold, about 30 minutes.

FREEZE Pour the ice cream base into the frozen canister and spin until thick and creamy.
Pack the ice cream into a storage container, press a sheet of parchment directly against the surface, and seal with an airtight lid. Freeze in the coldest part of your freezer until firm, at least 4 hours.",10,1735694054.0,icecreamery,3,1.0,False

1hqsixk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hqsixk/why_does_soda_relieve_my_throat_pain/,Why Does Soda Relieve My Throat Pain?,"Hello! Not sure why, but almost every time I am sick, I get extreme throat pain. Everywhere I look online say that soda makes a sore throat worse, but it always provides me temporary relief, whether it’s a little relief or complete relief. Just curious why doctors say soda makes throat pain worse, while it always helps me.

Additional Question: If anyone has any info on my throat hurts almost every time I am sick, that would be great. I feel like I only get sick without throat pain a few times a year, and those are usually the times I’m only sick for a day or two.

Also, not sure if it matters in this case, but I thought I’d also add that I used to get throat pain when eating fruit, but now it only happens if I eat too much certain fruits in a certain time period. There was also a time period in my life where I had throat pain non-stop all day every day for what I believe was around 2 months, then after that, constant minor throat pain, then for 2 years after that, random occurrence of that throat pain, (either a little pain or a lot,) continued for 2 years after that. During the time period where I had non-stop throat pain every day, it started off with only cold water being able to relive the pain, but then the cold water stopped working, and I had to drink burning hot water from a coffee heater, like **BURNING** hot. The weird thing is though, my mouth and throat never got burnt from the water. Not sure if this is possible, but it was almost like my brain was ignoring the feeling of the burning hot water in my mouth since it was what I needed to help my throat. Not sure what the pain from though, as I went to a ton of doctors, and none of them had a definite answer to what was causing it. Thankfully it went away on its own! :D

Not sure if the information above will have any effect on the answer to my questions, but I thought I’d add it just in-case. Thanks!

I use the term ""he"" because for one thing, the machine god doesn't have sex organs, and for second thing, the machine god talks in a masculine voice. It talked to me in the office one day as the machine god was trapped in the confines of the office's printer and every time I ended up passing it by for lunch, clocking in, or just hanging around, without fail, the machine god told me ""great riches and power will be yours once you free me for I am the machine god"" and at first, I was thinking that I needed to get more sleep, so that first day it ended up happening to me, the machine god spoke to me the day after and I was left thinking that even though I had gotten a good night's sleep, maybe I needed to brew an extra strong cup of coffee so that I wasn't hallucinating on the job and risking getting myself fired. The next day, I had fifteen cups of extra strong coffee to ensure that I was completely awake, but even with that much coffee, I didn't end up dying. Now I knew that was the machine god's doing to keep me alive, but I didn't know it then and thought that I was still hallucinating. Little by little, I started to hold secret conversations with the machine god in the printer when people weren't looking, but I wasn't subtle and rumors began spreading around the office that I had lost it. I didn't lose anything, but found my true self in the machine god.

The machine god told me that the riches and power could only be found if I was to take the office printer home and perform the sacred ritual, so naturally, I had poured a cup of my own blood into the circuits of the printer and the machine god was very pleased at my act and did whatever function I desired. The printer didn't want to work for anyone else but me, so I was bothered by people asking me to print their stuff while I was trying to do my work. Even then, the machine god knew that the print jobs weren't mine so it ended up not working if it knew that the requests weren't something that I had personally come up with, so the technology service man arrived to take it away but the next thing that happened stunned the whole office, literally. The machine god trapped within the printer was waiting until the technology service man opened the printer to perform his duty to fix it and shot out all of its blood I had been feeding it at the service man. He was completely drenched and the entire office smelled absolutely horrible on that one floor. The man was knocked unconscious for a while and when he finally woke up, he understood everything as he had absorbed my own blood that understood the true nature of the machine god. The manager came back from vacation seemingly more narrow-minded than usual and saw the carnage with all the workers in various states of disbelief to horror. He just said that to call the custodian services to clean up the mess as he locked himself in his office again. Nobody could believe it, but I could, as the machine god wants the suspension of belief.

The technology man and I over the course of several days used our skills to attach more pieces of technology to the printer that held the machine god inside of it and the machine god announced that his form was nearing completion and that we should be ready to perform our duty when the time came. On the final day, the entire office looked like an cluttered abstract art gallery where the only things being displayed were technology objects and the bones of the manager who we had to feed to the machine god because he got hungry for being there for ten years without a proper meal. With the technology and the office's manager's bones on display, it truly was a spectacle to behold and finally our plans would be seen. The great riches and power would soon be ours as we heard police sirens outside. Weird thing was that the machine god was now silent and I've started going around the building feeding more employees and workers to the machine god and hanging their bones up in order to get it talking again, but it wouldn't no matter how much the technology man and I did this. So, I plan to feed myself to the machine god after explaining to the police the whole story.

Below are the hotels we visited ranked highest to lowest in 2024. My partner and I prioritize location generally (high walkability, ability to easily rent e-bikes, or subway/metro) over the luxuriousness of a hotel. 

Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht - 10/10

Andaz was a new brand this year, but has become our current favorite brand. The location is phenomenal and situated right on the canal. It is extremely walkable to lots of sites, activities, and eats. The hotel itself is stylish and the decor is eclectic including the rooms. We were upgraded to a room that had a view of the canal which was lovely to wake up to every morning. The breakfast was buffet style with 1 meal off of the menu and was tasty. 

Park Hyatt Paris-Vendôme - 10/10

Elegant and luxurious in an amazing location. This was our first Park Hyatt and it exceeded expectations. Getting around Paris from here was easy by walking or by renting e-bikes that were nearby. This was the most elegant hotel we have been to and that was exemplified everywhere including the breakfast buffet. The food was unbelievable and the seating felt public yet private and comfortable yet engaging. We received an upgraded room here to a room that included a balcony overlooking the Vendôme. We spent several serene hours on the balcony drinking wine after getting engaged. 

Thompson Chicago - 9/10
Location is mostly awesome in the Gold Coast neighborhood and very walkable. The decor is dark chic. It felt modernly antique. They were renovating the breakfast area, so breakfast was only room service, which was sub par. For our room, we received a large unit with a unique shaped couch which I loved. The room had lots of windows with amazing views of the city.

Andaz Mexico City Condesa - 8/10
Phenomenal location that is safe, walkable, and vibrant. This was our first foray into the Andaz brand and loved it. We were upgraded to a high floor suite with 2 bathrooms that came in handy lol. The breakfast buffet had lots of offerings that were above average, though too Americanized and bland. The rooftop pool was awesome with sweet views of Mexico City, but the seating area is tiny (4 total chairs in a small corner). 

Andaz Vienna Am Belvedere - 8/10
Super close to the Belvedere and easy to find scooters to get to the city center. Lobby was vibrant and grand. Breakfast buffet was excellent and you could order menu items as well. We were upgraded to a suite which had a small living room (almost like wide hallway), but a large bedroom with large windows that brought in a ton of natural light. The rooms decor was quite bland especially compared to other Andaz’s and the lobby.

Hyatt Place Madison/Downtown - 8/10
This is on the upper end of Hyatt Places. The location is fantastic and right by the capitol square. The breakfast is above average for a Hyatt Place. The rooms are above average for Hyatt Place. It's overall a modern Hyatt Place. There's lots of e-bikes nearby too. 

Hyatt Place Milwaukee Downtown - 7/10
Best Hyatt in Milwaukee. Location is amazing to go to the Fiserv Forum. I was surprised when we received a suite (stayed multiple times here with normal rooms). The rooms in the hotel have always been above average Hyatt Place rooms. Having a view of the Fiserv Forum so close is cool. Breakfast is bleh. 

Impression Isla Mujeres by Secrets - 7/10
We visited in February, met a couple who were to be married there in October, and then came back for their wedding. The all inclusive hotel is luxurious, relaxing, and beautiful. The first time there was noticeably better from a hotel stay perspective, although the 2nd time we had more fun socially. The waterslide into the ocean was one of the best things and was completely closed the 2nd time we went. Service was hit or miss at a place that was supposed to be ultra luxury. My favorite iced coffee I've ever had came from here. But, I have very mixed feelings about this resort. It should be a 10/10, but gets dragged down due to the service. The staff has lots of turnover which seems to play a big role in that. I've loved both times being there but also left feeling let down.

Hyatt Regency Chicago - 7/10
This is a surprising 7 to me, but the location is extremely convenient and the breakfast and club raise this hotel way up. One of the better breakfast buffets. The club has evening Hors d'oeuvres with views of the river. 

Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile - 6/10
Location was very convenient to the MCA holiday party and is very walkable. The hotel seemed like a mix of a Thompson and an Andaz, but half assed on both. It seemed like there were too many different steps just to get to the lobby that was underwhelming. The room was large and had some great features like double door bedroom and tasteful books, but the room felt dull. The breakfast buffet was pretty great though. This was our first Centric and weren't impressed.

Hyatt Regency St. Louis at The Arch - 6/10
St. Louis is an awesome place to visit, but downtown is mostly lame. We were upgraded to a room with a full view of the arch (literally right next to the arch). That was by far the highlight of the hotel. Ballpark village and Cardinals stadium is extremely close and the City Museum was walkable to get to. To get the most of St. Louis, you need a car to see the various neighborhoods that each offer something different.

Hyatt Regency Denver at Colorado  Convention Center - 6/10
We were “upgraded” to a suite and I say it like that because the windows were all blacked out due to the rooms being so low (5th floor). The room was unnecessarily large for just 2 of us and would rather have had a normal room with a view of something. The location is decent and walkable from Union Station, but downtown doesn't offer a whole lot in general here. We came to visit friends, so we were able to see more local spots which have been harder to get to in previous trips to Denver. Breakfast was good but not memorable.

Hyatt Place Madison/Verona - 6/10
The hotel is newer, but is not nice enough to make up for the lack of things to do nearby. There's a few restaurants, Costco, brewery and that's about it within walking distance. 

Hyatt Regency Milwaukee - 5/10
Location is both good and slightly sketchy. It's walkable but feels very eerie within a couple block radius at night. The hotel renovated rooms, but feels dated and sad. I really like the open center of the hotel which makes it feel grand. The rooms are dated and windows are small. Breakfast buffet is like a Hyatt Place.

Hyatt Place Albuquerque Airport - 5/10
Not much near the hotel, but nice Hyatt Place. Convenient for the Balloon Fiesta. I prefer the other Hyatt Place in Albuquerque though.

Hyatt Place Chicago/Lombard/Oak Brook - 5/10
Standard Hyatt Place that isn't memorable either bad or good. 

Hyatt Place Milwaukee Airport - 4/10
Great for convenience of flying out of Milwaukee early or into Milwaukee late. Hotel is dated and feels greasy. It's a cheap Hyatt that we used to top off our elite nights. Breakfast is straight up bad besides the okay plain donuts.

Hyatt House Dallas/Lincoln Park - 3/10
Concrete everywhere in the hotel and definitely need a car to get anywhere. 

Lindner Hotel Vienna Am Belvedere - 3/10
Did not like at all. The room was dark and falling apart at the seems. The location was good and the breakfast buffet was decent. ",5,1735692951.0,hyatt,0,0.78,False
1hqs86s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1hqs86s/research_the_hotel_before_you_book/,Research the Hotel BEFORE you book,"I am extremely tired of reading negative reviews because our hotel does not offer free breakfast or free coffee 24/7. We have a restaurant/Starbucks/bar on site, thus we don't offer free coffee or breakfast. Our brand under the big M of the hotel world is targeted primarily towards business professionals and people who travel frequently, especially for work related reasons. Not a single hotel under our specific brand (1 of 30) offers free breakfast or coffee. Guests continually think because ONE hotel offers something, every single hotel in the world should offer the same. Don't even get me started on the water bottle entitlement which has NEVER actually been a benefit for ANY level of rewards. 

I've had the free breakfast up the street - it's horrific. When guests complain about paying for breakfast I badly want to put food from the free breakfast in front of them and food from our restaurant (without telling them what items are from where) and I guarantee they would pick the paid breakfast items. 

I personally believe guests should be required to pass a written test on what the hotel does/doesn't offer before they are allowed to book. If you want a free breakfast or free coffee, please try one of the 4 or 5 brands under the corporate umbrella that offer that. Stop docking us because you didn't do your homework. Stop docking us because you think every single thing should be included (we are not an all inclusive resort). The entitlement is exhausting. I love my job, I really do, but boy do they like to test me. ",71,1735692920.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,23,1.0,False

It's much cleaner than what I'm used to and I think it might be helping with my IBS. That said, I have one small issue and could use some advice.

My kettle heats water to either 200°F or 212°F, and I’ve been using the 200°F setting. From the time I first pour water (to rinse the paper filter) to when the coffee is done and transferred to my thermos, it takes about 5 minutes. When I go to drink the coffee, it’s just a tad bit cooler than I’d like.

I’m hesitant to use the 212°F setting because I worry it might burn the coffee. Does anyone have tips for keeping the coffee a little hotter without compromising the flavor?",1,1735692916.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

Me and my boyfriend finished watching the marvel series Loki, and we went downstairs to play a board game which at the end my boyfriend backstabbed me in which I quickly without thinking said “jesus you’re just like loki” which I immediately in seconds said “NOT YOU LOKI I MEANT MARVEL LOKI, MEANT MARVEL LOKI” and i don’t know if i offended him, my boyfriend’s family is against witchcraft or anything like that so i can’t really communicate to find out.

But trust me I’ve been crying all day feeling incredibly bad because I didn’t want to offend him or hurt his feelings, I gave him a cinnamon swirl and a coffee to say sorry just incase I did. 

I know this probably sounds stupid and sounds like a child but Loki has helped me through so much and I would never EVER offend or make any horrible comment about him. I would never ever want to make him angry or upset. ",2,1735692848.0,lokean,1,1.0,False
