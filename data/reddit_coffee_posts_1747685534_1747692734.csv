1kqohv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fate/comments/1kqohv0/i_was_so_upset_at_how_disney_is_butchering_the/,"I was so upset at how Disney is butchering the Lilo and Stitch live-action, that I went and dug up this 10-year-old fanfic I remembered of Stitch being summoned as a grail servant in fate stay night. Link at the bottom","They are sitting upon tiles of gold and black. Seven figures in all formed from purest of silver and shining like stars in the perpetual darkness that surrounds them. Each piece is a representation of a distinctive class of Servant, the primary seven that are supposed to be summoned in every Holy Grail War since the time of the cataclysmic disaster that had been the first. The second War was hardly any better but the Third… oh but the travesty that had occurred…

From that travesty, any War which followed in the wake of the Third would always end in disaster for though the Holy Grail would and still could grant any wish the winner desired, it was by the will of that which now clung tightly upon it like a cancer to its once glorious chalice and stained it black with decay and evil. How much evil you ask…?

Why, all the evil in the world.

So here they sit, the seven Servants of the Holy Grail War, awaiting their chance to move upon the board and play the game anew. Neither they nor their Masters ever made aware of the agonies that would meet them should they prove victorious. There, at the front of the pack sits the coveted Saber, masters of the blade. On either side sits the remaining knight classes of Archer and Lancer, both with the weapons that begot them their namesake clutched tightly in hand. Just behind the foremost Servant was the robed figure of the Caster, an artisan of their age. Behind the magician was the wretched figures of a cloaked Assassin hiding their face behind a skulled visage and the Berserker whose madness was so feral that to wear the head of a beast made its appearance as a wild beast all the more apparent. At the rear came the Rider, clutching reins tightly in hand.

Seven in all…

There was plenty of space upon the opened board and the prize at the opposite end. From the blackness, a hand reached out…

And took the madness in its grasp.

A feral thing, guided more by monstrous bloodlust than intelligent thought, and certainly without the almost regal dignity necessary for the three Knight Classes. A mad dog put on a tight leash that did little to curb its disobedience and offered little to no control over that which was as wild as the wind in the midst of a storm.

But then, it was a Berserker…

***From Across the Throne of Heroes***

*""The Chaos""*

Let it never be said that Jubstacheit von Einzbern did not care for any of his family, artificial or natural. Why, he had been exceptionally gracious towards his ""granddaughter"", the scion of the Einzbern family's greatest betrayer, Kiritsugu Emiya, by not only allowing her to live but to break the solemn vow to the girl's mother and make unto her the next vessel for the Holy Grail. An agonizing process that would kill normal people, Jubstacheit further proved his love for his grandchild by torturing her endlessly with lies of her father's abandonment and betrayal, of her mother's death and needless sacrifice, and that no matter how much she wished otherwise, there would be no end to the ""training"" which she received at his cold, merciless hands.

Truly, Jubstacheit von Einzbern cared deeply for his family.

If he hadn't, why then would he declare Illyasviel ready to summon a Servant of her own for the early arrival of the Fifth Holy Grail War? Why then would he grant her the use of a catalyst in which to summon her Servant forth? True, he had thrown her out of the familial estate into the freezing woods of Germany's Black Forest in the middle of the night, but he had the good grace to have her attired rather than stuck out in the bitter winter completely naked as he had for her mother. That the wolves of the forest were proving exceptionally daring were hardly any concern as Illya was quite capable of defending herself from harm, even if she had been starved the previous day and endured a cold Germanic winter night in nothing more than a nightgown.

If she couldn't, well then she'd be dead and her purpose, while unfulfilled, could easily be substituted.

So here Illyasviel was, running for her life as a pack of the white-furred wolves that made the Black Forest infamous across the entirety of the World gave chase after her. Her feet were bloody and were she of a natural body, would have long since succumbed to the necrotic fangs of frostbite. Her once pristine nightgown was torn and shredded in several places and stained with ugly red splotches around those vicious cuts.

Still she kept running with one hand clasping tightly the small piece of meteoric rock that her grandfather deemed adequate enough to summon a Servant. A summoning that she had neither the energy nor the breath to properly invoke, but that was okay.

For some things, words just weren't necessary.

Illyasviel glanced back to see how close the wolves were and tripped over a hidden root and tumbled into the freezing snow. She closed her eyes tightly, her breath coming in ragged gasps as she prepared for an end that was long in waiting… and still not yet arrived? And was it wicked imagination brought on by a cruel combination of hunger and fatigue that sparked the sudden feeling of magic in the air? She dared not open her eyes to find out but listened with rapt attention as the strangely childish sounding roar that halted the wolves in their tracks.

Curiosity soon won over fear and Illyasviel opened her eyes just in time to witness the very tree whose roots she had tripped over being ripped from free from the earth and hurled with all the ease of one tossing a stick. She could have sworn she had heard someone call out, ""Fetch doggies!"" but was frankly far too shocked to do anything more than flap her mouth like a fish. Not because the wolves had at long last given up the chase and were fleeing with their tails between their legs. Not because she had witnessed a several centuries old tree being hurled with the ease of one tossing a Frisbee.

No, it was because the mighty Servant Berserker that she had inexplicably summoned *two months early*… was all of three feet tall if even that much. More than that however, more than his unbelievable strength or his strange, almost alien physique… was one simple inexcusable fact that would forever endear him in his Master's heart.

""You're so cute! And fluffy!""

Okay then, two facts but no more than that!

*""You stand before this council accused of illegal genetic experimentation!""*

*""How do you plead?""*

*""Not guilty! My experiments are only theoretical and completely within legal boundaries.""*

*""We believe you actually… created something.""*

*""Created something? HAH! But that would be irresponsible and unethical. I would never, ever…""*

*FWISH*

*""… Make… more than one?""*

In hindsight, Shirou Emiya should have realized that breaking one of the cardinal rules of magi was just asking for retribution by Akasha itself. But really, how was he to know that even thinking that the night which had already revealed one impossible revelation after another could possibly get any worse? A classmate being not only a magi but the Guardian of the Land, witnessing not one but *three* legendary heroes fight to the death, becoming a part of a secret battle royale for the Holy Grail? Surely there was no other curveball that the Root could *possibly* throw at him next.

Oh Shirou…

Just be thankful that you kept the words in your head for surely retribution would have come to you on three separate fronts by dawn's breaking…

Contrary to what you might assume, you would most certainly have died without ever once being killed.

He was the first of the three to spot her, again with that strange accompaniment of feeling as though she were someone he should know. No, not just that… Someone close to him if not by blood but by—

""Good evening, onii-chan. This is the second time we've met like this isn't it?"" The pale-haired young girl turned her crimson eyes to the girl at Shirou's left and curtseyed politely. ""How do you do, Rin? I am Illya. Illyasviel von Einzbern. I assume you've heard of me?""

By the way her own skin paled, it seemed that the young Tohsaka had indeed. ""Einzbern…?""

Illya giggled. ""I suppose there's no point in making any more introductions. After all, you're all going to die here. Okay? I'm going to kill you now. Go get them, Berserker!""

It was then, in that moment, where three pairs of eyes were at long last taken away from the foreign magus and at last fell upon the being at her side. By the name, Shirou had admittedly thought of some sort of hulking brute, leather-skinned and red-eyed with madness. What he saw instead… Well…

""Uh… isn't that just a puppy?"" asked Shirou.

To the boy's credit, he actually kept a straight, if not slightly confused, face by the strange appearance of the Servant and was still sensibly cautious from its presence. After all, though he could not see it or feel it as most magi can, there was no mistaking the sheer *power* in the Berserker's scent…

And the smell of coffee and coconuts…

An odd but pleasant mix…

His Servant, the Saber of the Fifth Holy Grail War and a veteran of the Fourth, kept narrowed eyes upon the Berserker. The shifting winds in the grasp of her right hand were the only sign of her sword's sudden appearance but she made no move to strike just yet. Like her Master, she could not outright believe that this tiny pup was to be the Berserker of this War. Yet if the last had taught her anything then it was to never judge a Servant by their appearance alone.

No matter how cute and fluffy they were.

Rin Tohsaka, Guardian of the Land and the last of a line of once prestigious and obscenely rich magi, whose acting skills were the kind that would make playwrights as great as Shakespeare himself beg on hands and knees for her to be in every production possible, and one who remained stone-faced in the face of his sister's removal, her father's death, and her mother's insanity… Cracked like an egg and broke out in uproarious laughter at the sight of the tiny Servant.

""Th-That's your Servant?! Wh-What's he gonna do? *Bark* at us?!"" She laughed so hard tears were coming out of her eyes and she likely would have kept on laughing if something wet and slimy hadn't hit her right in the kisser with a slick splat.

She froze. Slowly, almost mechanically, a hand reached up and touched the viscous fluid and realized the fact that yes indeed the Servant Berserker had decided his opening move for the Fifth Holy Grail War to be a spitball to the face.

Shirou blinked in surprise and managed to repress the urge to snigger because really, the look on Tohsaka's face… but no, a hero does not laugh. Not aloud where the victim can hear and offer her own form of retribution anyway.

Illya had no such strength as her adopted brother and was laughing alongside her Servant.

Saber scowled in distaste but there was a slight smirk to her face at seeing the arrogant Master receiving her long overdue comeuppance.

As for Rin… Well…

She twitched once before letting loose an animalistic scream that would wake the dead.

Yet again she would owe Shirou Emiya her life thanks to the fact that the taller redhead deemed it necessary to hold the girl back lest she actually try and throttle the Berserker with her bare hands.

A good thing he did considering that the Berserker decided for his second move to knock down the nearest streetlamp and proceed to use it as a massive hammer in a demented reimagining of whack-a-mole with the startled Saber. The blonde-haired Servant only managed to escape from the now weapon-bearing Servant's strikes by taking to the phone lines above and running across them. The Berserker shouted and toss the streetlamp ahead of her, ending her escape and bringing down the telephone lines for the entire block in the process.

The Saber leapt for the Berserker's Master and landed before the small girl sword upraised for the killing stroke.

And stopped.

Just as her Master, the Saber had an innate feeling that there was more to this girl than appearance's belayed. However, where Shirou's came from the depths of his gut and with no real name to it, the Saber's came from an errant memory not from her life as a mortal but that as a Servant. Of a scruffy faced man with a heart of cold, unbending steel smiling with all the warmth of a loving father upon a girl who possessed both her mother's eyes and hair…

Déjà vu aside… If there were a few lessons from that bumbling fool of a wizard that Arturia Pendragon ever took to heart it was '*There was no such thing as coincidence*'.

""Are you Ki—?"" The Saber had no chance to finish as her title was cried out by her Master, drawing emerald eyes away from crimson just in time to see the Berserker descending upon her once more but with a drastic change to his appearance. She leapt clear, once more putting herself between her Master and the Berserker, taking in the creature's altered appearance with a critical eye. Still short and oddly colored, the Berserker now sported a second pair of arms beneath the first, twin antennae twitching upon his brow, and along his spine a trio of bladed quills.

And yet somehow, the Berserker still maintained the visage of being both fluffy and cute.

*That has to be a Noble Phantasm of some sort,* the Saber decided. *There is no other way that I could consider such a sight as that being cute.*

It was then, unfortunately, that the Saber's still earlier injury made itself known and brought the blonde swordswoman down to one knee, a gauntlet covered hand reaching up to her breast.

""Saber!"" Recognizing that his Servant was still suffering from her earlier battle, Shirou raised forward to try and get between her and the Berserker when, surprisingly, Rin pulled him back and put herself between him and his Servant.

""Vier Stil Erschiessung!"" A curse that hails from the lands of Scandinavia, the *Gandr* is not a wholly powerful use of magic though it lives up to its reputation of being one of the more vicious of curses. A single hit decreases the physical health of the target by equal equivalence to the amount of power in the ""shot"". That is to say, the more prana forced into the *Gandr* the more powerful it becomes, and though she is not a member of the Edelfelt family, Rin's own variation of the spell is akin to being hit by a pistol bullet at point blank range.

By all accounts, the Berserker should have been at least been mildly disorientated by his virtue of being a Servant alone despite the ""aid"" of madness under his Class. But the Berserker did not even so much as twitch at the first shot, the sixth, and all the way down to the twenty-sixth. Oh no, he didn't twitch or even blink.

He *giggled*.

""Wha-What is *that thing?!*"" shrieked Rin, seriously considering the pros and cons of using her last Command Spell to summon forth her Servant regardless of his own injuries at the Saber's sword.

Glancing away from the girl who was two steps shy of having a hissy fit, the Berserker's obsidian orbs returned to the Saber and, with a toothy smile, he reached behind his back…

And pulled out a quartet of *guns*.

""Meega, nala kwishta! Hahahahaha!"" So said the Berserker before unleashing a torrent of plasma-burning bullets of blazing bedlam upon the Saber who had no chance to dodge the hailstorm of ammunition. To her credit as both a warrior and a Servant, she was thrown back with nary a sound for though her faerie-forged armor had maintained its form, each ball-sized bullet had impacted against her with the force of a cannonball.

""Saber!"" Once more, Shirou tried to interfere and again he was repelled but this time by the bloodied hand of his Servant. Taking ragged breaths of air, blood dripping forth from her mouth, the Saber rose slowly to her feet with the aid of her sword with the winds guarding its identity splattering her dripping blood about.

""Oh, come on, you can't possibly win. It's quite obvious that my Berserker here is far superior than your King of Knights!"" Illyasviel said.

""King of Knights…"" murmured Rin before her eyes widened with realization, her head turning sharply to face the bloodied Saber. ""You mean she's—?!""

""That's right!"" Illyasviel giggled. ""The King of Camelot and the ideal for which all knights strive for, King Arturia Pendragon! By all accounts, there is no one better suited for the Saber Class of Servants and yet here is my Servant, an unknown even to my family, standing without injury!"" Illyasviel laughed once more. ""All right, Berserker! Quickly before Avalon's magic takes hold, blow Saber's head right off like how Papa would!""

*Like… Papa…?* The Saber blinked, blood coloring her vision red and yet she still saw the woman from whom Illyasviel was birthed standing like a ghost behind the impossibly young-looking girl. *She is—!*

""Ih."" The Berserker grunted as he raised his guns and fired—

Just in time for Shirou to throw the Saber aside and take the barrage of plasma for himself.

It was only thanks to his own subconscious *Reinforcement* that Shirou hadn't been ignited on contact but even so, it was blatantly obvious to all involved that he had taken the mortal blow meant for his Servant with absolutely no hesitation.

""Shirou… Shirou!"" cried the Saber, pushing herself to her feet without the aid of her sword while Rin gaped uselessly in the background.

The Berserker had lowered his guns and was staring openmouthed at the boy's body while his Master… Well…

""Why… Why did he do that…?"" Illyasviel whispered to herself. ""He… He just… Why would he do that?!""

Everything her grandfather had ever said, everything she had ever been told of her father and the boy that he had left her behind to raise as his own child… none of it made any sense with the sight that laid bleeding and smoldering on the ground before her, struggling to stay alive. It was only thanks to her own acute senses as both a homunculus and a vessel for the Holy Grail that Illyasviel became aware of Avalon's power streaming through her adopted brother's bloodied body… and healing it from within one wound at a time.

Too many questions but all that mattered was that her brother would live still to answer them.

""Berserker! We're leaving."" Illyasviel turned her back to the group, completely unafraid of retaliation even as she addressed the last of the Tohsaka, the fires of familial jealousy burning free from her sharp tongue. ""Oh, and Rin? Just so that we're clear, the next time we meet, I'm going to kill you."" She headed off into the darkness of the night while her Servant remained behind.

The Berserker looked once more to Shirou to the guns he held in his paws. He did not see a teenaged boy with red hair willingly placing himself in harm's way for the betterment of his Servant. No, the Berserker saw a girl, obsidian locks screaming for answers in the warning nightmares during those dark days when his own body was turning against him and nearly cost him the life and love of his family.

With nary a second thought, the Berserker *hurled* them into the far reaches of the city and with a practiced shudder resumed his doggy-like form once more before running off after his Master.

And deep in the dark bowels of her lair, a young woman watched as one of those weapons flew through the air and with nary a spoken word, was caught in midair by an unseen hand.

And the Caster smiled.

*""Oh yes, mm-hmm, all of our dogs are adoptable… EXCEPT THAT ONE!""*

*""What is that thing?!""*

*""A dog, I think…! But it was dead this morning!""*

*""It was dead this morning?!""*

*""Well we thought it was dead, it was hit by a truck!""*

*""I* like *him! C'mere boy!""*

Rin glared across the table and into the bowels of the Emiya household's kitchen where few were allowed to perfect their culinary arts, daring the Berserker to make some kind of move, *any kind of move* that would warrant a reaction that was both hostile and a little bit overzealous. It was not that she was still sore that her Servant Archer had fallen to this *thing* so easily, I mean really who could have predicted the little booger leaping up, catching one of *her Servant's* arrows and tossing it right back at him? If Rin couldn't foresee such a possibility than frankly no one could have. No, her hostilities did not lie so much in the Servant but his Master who had the gall, the sheer unbridled *gall*, to call a truce with *Rin's apprentice!*

The self-same Master who was currently sitting opposite of Shirou, still as stone and her expression harder than granite whilst his Servant Saber explained how it was that she knew of the validity of Illyasviel von Einzbern's claim of being Shirou's sister.

*So what?* Thought Rin, *Does that mean we should trust her Servant not to poison us?*

Not that the heavenly smells coming from the kitchen belayed any such thought but really, it was a *Servant* that was *cooking* in an enemy Master's *kitchen!* Did nobody else find that completely ludicrous?!

As though summoned by her mental breakdown, the Berserker shuffled into the room with all four of his arms carrying massive trays of food and one atop his head. Setting the trays upon the table, the Berserker sat at his Master's side just as Shirou was beginning to grasp his relationship with Illyasviel.

""So… you're my older sister? I still have…a family?""

Shirou Emiya, bearer of the Unlimited Blade Works, possible candidate for Counter Guardianship for Alaya, and proclaimer of the obvious.

""Ohana!"" interrupted the Berserker.

Rin rolled her eyes and took another bite of her heavenly —*adequate—* meal. It certainly did not match her cook's —*apprentice's*— incredible standards of a meal. No matter that the Saber had taken but a single bite and was actually eating *slowly*. That is to say that her meal was only a third of the way gone and not completely vanished into the impossibly trim waist.

Not that Rin was bitter about that or anything…

""What gibberish your Servant speaks, Einzbern. *Ohana*,"" Rin said with a sneer as she tried to mimic the small Servant's voice. ""What does that even mean?""

For the first time since the Saber had brought heartbreaking memories to the fore of her mind, the fire that Illyasviel had inherited from both her parents alit itself in her eyes but it was not her who answered to the Tohsaka's mockery.

""Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind. Or forgotten.""

It was quite considerate of Rin to not have been taking a drink from her tea for, if she had, it surely would have shattered like fine porcelain in her hands no matter the amount of *reinforcement* she poured into it.

""It *talks too?!*"" she screeched. ""That little monster can hurl cars with ease, grasp concepts faster than my idiot cook over there, stop a swing from *Excalibur* with its bare hands, and now it can apparently hold a conversation?! Just what are you, you little monster?!""

The Berserker blinked before smiling toothily at the Tohsaka. ""Cute and fluffy!""

A few miles away, deep in the bowels of his church, one Kirei Kotomine suddenly felt as though he had missed a golden opportunity as a faint but oh so familiar scream of reached his ears…

I text him and then he texts back a couple hours later and then we text a little more but seems very much the opposite of how interested he seemed in person, and then said he had a very busy week so I told him to just let me know when’s a good time and he said he would. I then saw him at the gym since and he smiled and waved hi from afar but besides that haven’t seen him here or heard from him.

I bought a Sorella Quickmill e61 machine about a year ago. (Just picture a typical chrome e61 with dual boilers and a rotary pump.) 

Installation: It's plumbed in. It receives regular maintenance involving backflushing every two weeks. (Screen out). 

Setup: I pull one shot each day. I typically charge with 17g coffee and I pull the shot for 25-25 sec. to produce 30g of espresso. The pressure is 9 Bar. The boiler temp is 199.

Things went well until about a month ago when I noticed that when I remove the portafilter after pulling a shot, water has pooled on top of the puck. I've also noticed a change in the taste quality. My method hasn't changed, so I have to wonder what is happening with the machine that would lead to this?

I took 25-50mg for about 3 months in 2023, and I also took it on and off for a month or so at a time between 2014 and 2018, at higher doses.

Lately I started taking 12.5 or 25mg three times a week or so, for the last month due to insomnia.  Did not have any undesired effects, even seemed to boost libido a bit the next day.

I woke up the next day feeling really out of it, and since then, I have been experiencing crippling anhedonia, brain fog, forgetting words not following conversations, no creativity, no good or bad feelings, derealization, lack of appetite and hunger, no response to coffee/nicotine/alcohol or my adhd meds.  My whole body and brain just feel completely numb.  I feel slow and delayed, time just slips by and I feel like I'm in a very quiet daze.  I feel this way from the second I wake up.

How we found each other.
How we built this life—this loud, quiet, beautiful, ordinary, extraordinary life.
And I still won’t have the perfect words.
But I’ll have the moments.
And you.

Because everything begins and ends with you.

I’ll remember the first glance.
Not the slow-motion, scripted kind—
but the type where something shifts just beneath the ribs.
The moment the room didn’t matter, the clock didn’t matter, the version of me that existed before didn’t matter.
Because you were there.
And that was the start of something I didn’t even know I was waiting for.

You didn’t walk in and complete me.
You walked in, and for the first time, I didn’t feel like I had to prove I was whole.

And from that moment on—
we’ve been writing this story together.

I’ll remember how quickly the big things gave way to the small ones.
The tiny rituals.
The language only we speak.
Your laugh echoing down a hallway.
Your hand reaching for mine during traffic.
The way you drink tea with both hands around the mug like it’s the last warmth in the world.
The way you remember things no one else ever noticed.

There’s a lifetime of firsts I’ll never forget.

The first real kiss—slow, sure, full of knowing.
The first time I saw you cry and knew exactly what to say.
The first night we stayed up till morning, talking about everything and nothing,
and fell asleep with smiles on our lips and tangled feet under the covers.

The first time I caught you staring at me like you knew too.
Like maybe this—whatever it was, whatever it would become—was already written into us.

The first time we argued.
The fear in my gut at the thought of losing you.
And the overwhelming relief when we chose to stay.
To grow.
To fight, not against each other—but for us.

The first shared holiday.
The first quiet Sunday morning with nowhere to be but next to you.
The first hard conversation.
The first celebration that felt like ours alone.

The first night I rolled over and whispered, “This is it, isn’t it?”
And you didn’t say a word.
You just smiled, and pulled me closer.

And then there were the moments that no one saw.
The ones that never made it to photo albums or social media.

Like the time I walked in and found you humming in the kitchen, hair a mess, dancing with your socks sliding across the floor, and I had to steady myself on the doorway—because God, you were beautiful.
Not the kind of beautiful that stops hearts.
The kind that starts them.

The time you stayed up with me while I was quiet and couldn’t explain why.
You didn’t fill the space with questions.
You just stayed.
Held my hand.
Told me without words that I didn’t have to carry it alone.

The night I came home exhausted and frustrated and halfway undone,
and you kissed my forehead like it was a sacred thing.
Like I was still your favorite.

You saw the version of me I tried to hide.
And you didn’t flinch.
You wrapped your arms around the tired, unfiltered man I was that day,
and made him feel safe.

And I’ll never forget that night in the car.

The rain tapping gently against the roof.
The heater humming, your lip caught between your teeth,
your seatbelt half undone.

We kissed like time had bent around us.
Like the world had stepped outside for a cigarette and left us there to burn slow.

And your scent—
God, your scent—
it wasn’t perfume.
It was you.

And in that moment,
I changed.

I wasn’t a man anymore.
I was something instinctive.
Feral in love.
Soft in heart.
Unapologetically yours in ways I didn’t have language for.

You didn’t ignite lust.
You awakened the part of me that knows how to protect.
Knows how to kneel.
Knows how to love like it’s prayer.

You’ve made the ordinary feel holy.

You’ve made the smallest gestures feel like love letters I get to open daily.
The way you straighten my collar before we leave the house.
The way you say my name when you’re laughing.
The way your hands fit in mine like they’ve always been there.

You’ve taught me that love isn’t measured in grand acts—
it’s measured in consistency.
In compassion.
In staying.

You are the calm that quiets my storms.
And you are the wildfire that keeps my soul alive.

Even when we don’t speak,
I feel you.

You change the air in the room.
You bring me stillness I didn’t think possible.
You bring me home.

And I know we’ll grow old.
We’ll slow down.
Our backs will ache, and the kids might move away, and time will do what time does.

But I’ll still kiss your shoulder in the mornings.
I’ll still hold your hand when we cross the street.
I’ll still look at you in the middle of making dinner and forget what I was saying—
because you still take my breath.

And when that day comes—
when one of us must go first—
I hope you know:

You’ll never truly be without me.

I’ll be in the drawer where you keep the old notes.
In the smell of coffee in the kitchen.
In the space beside you when the world is too loud and you just want to feel held again.

Because loving you wasn’t something I did.
It’s who I am.

And if love has weight—
if it leaves behind any kind of imprint in this world—
then you’ll always find me.

In the softness.
In the stillness.
In the life we built.

And in honor of National Devil's Food Cake Day, HINESight ranked the **Top 5 Devil's Food Cakes, and some of them are not even cakes, from non-chain bakeries across the U.S.**, using Yelp + Google reviews from 2025.



***Here's the countdown:***

1. **Hot Cakes (Seattle, WA)** — Molten center, 3.9k reviews. Unreal.
2. **Cake Life Bake Shop (Philly, PA)** — Campfire Cocoa, a Three-layer chocolate cake frosted with hot chocolate whipped cream, topped with candied cocoa nibs, and toasted house-made marshmallows! Beyoncé-approved. Chocolate royalty.
3. **Sweet Lady Jane (Santa Monica, CA)** — A triple—layer beauty, Heavenly Dark Chocolate is perfectly balanced and cocoa-forward.
4. **Bakehouse (Chicago, IL)** — Chocolate Ganache Tart is a popular dessert. It has a buttery, flaky crust and a rich, decadent chocolate ganache filling. ""Moist, bold, and criminally underrated.""
5. **Pie Junkie (OKC)** — They load up a flaky pie crust with fudgy chocolate filling, then crown it with salted bourbon caramel and crunchy pecans. Devil's Food, but make it pie. (Heads up — they're closed Mondays.)



Devil's Food Cake was first documented in 1898 and is known for its deep cocoa flavor and use of boiling water or coffee to unlock richness. Angel Food came first, but this cake finishes last *in the best way*.

Not an actual post, but AITA be like:

**AITA FOR TELLING MY MOM I SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN TO LIVE WITH MY DAD AFTER THE DIVORCE?** -- I (24f) finally landed my dream job, but my boss (55m) groped me in the meeting room in front of my male colleagues and promised them all bonuses if they'd keep their mouth shut. When I facetimed my sister (28f) sobbing, she just shrugged and said, ""Boys will be boys,"" so I thought maybe I was just overreacting. But then my boss paid the maintenance staff to glue thumbtacks in my office chair, toilet paper and egg my car, and poison my morning coffee with eyedrops. 

Again, I went to my sister for advice, thinking surely she'd see the problem now. But she accused me of being a drama queen, saying those sounded like typical office pranks to her and that I should be willing to ""make sacrifices if you want to get to the top."" And, again, I started thinking maybe she was right. After all, this is my dream job. 

I finally had enough when I found out that my boss's secretary had snapped photos of me under the bathroom stall door when I had diarrhea from the eyedrops and sent them as an email attachment to the whole department. I took it to HR, but since the HR director is my boss's lover, she just cackled maniacally, threatened to withhold all of my overtime pay, and said if I tried to file a workforce complaint, the entire office would sign sworn affidavits saying that I had set everything up to get attention and that they were just deducting all the damage I had caused to the office. I just knew my sister would take my side this time. To my horror, her response was, ""Sorry, Sis. No one ever broke the glass ceiling by whining about office drama."" That was the last straw. I told her I no longer wanted her to be my bridesmaid in my upcoming wedding. She forwarded my text to the private group chat she had going with my fiancé and my mom, and they both took her side, saying ""blood is thicker than water,"" and I shouldn't have booted her from my wedding just because I can't seem to put my big girl pants on and keep my emotions in check at work. 

My fiancé (47m) said the wedding is off if I don't apologize to my sister immediately and tell her that she can still be my bridesmaid. He said I'm lucky that he chose me over her since she's the prettier sister and gave better BJs the year that she took his 4th period chemistry class than I did 4 years later when I was in his 1st period class, which, frankly, I don't think is a fair comparison because what high school student is ever fully awake in their 1st period class? I told him, ""fine. I don't want to marry someone who won't even use unbiased metrics when comparing BJ skills between sisters and former students."" I threw my engagement ring in the sewer grate and canceled the wedding. My mom emerged from the shadows behind my fiancé, where she'd been lurking the whole time and said I had no right to do that to him because she had already paid for the cake and the reservations for the venue, both of which are non-refundable. Plus, she said she already considers my fiancé ""the son I never had"" (there was a blurry spot on my first ultrasound that the tech said was a pen1s, so my mom got all excited and was crushed when the 2nd ultrasound revealed that she would be having a second daughter, not a son, and she has never let me forget that).

She said she's already chosen a name for her grandbaby even though I'm not even pregnant yet, and she even let it slip that she and my fiancé had planned to switch my birth control pills with sugar pills before we left for the honeymoon. I was so angry I lost it and told her I wish I had never chosen to live with her when she and dad divorced. My dad had been away on his annual cruise with his new wife while all this was happening, and when he came back, I felt like I finally had someone who I could confide in. I told him the whole story. He said I should be ashamed of myself for saying something so hurtful to the woman who gave me life and changed my diapers. He told me that my reaction was disproportionate to the situation. Is my dad right? AITA? Should I apologize to my mom, climb into the sewer to retrieve the ring, call the preacher to tell him the wedding is back on, tell my sister that she can still be my bridesmaid, and just keep my head down at work from now on??


I remember when most of the posts used to at least appear to be genuine; even if they weren't, it wasn't so blatantly obvious. I used to have to really give it some thought because of the nuances of certain situations. Do I think this person is in the wrong? I mean...maybe, but maybe not. And even after forming an opinion, reading the comments, I might see a POV that I hadn't considered and think, ""fair enough."" Now, more often than not the posts are so OTT that it's immediately obvious that the story is either AI generated or the poster has created a situation in which there's no possibility that anyone would, in good faith, say, ""Yeah, you're in the wrong, here,"" and the further into the story, the worse it gets and the clearer it becomes that there's just no way. What's even the point?

For context, I tried to ask my friends about this and they said I was “dreaming” and didn’t give any real advice so here I am. I am a male, 22 years old, fresh out of college working my first big boy job. I wouldn’t say I am a 10/10 by any means and I have never really had tons of luck with girls outside of getting introduced or being around them a lot like school. I workout, have fortunate height but consider myself extremely awkward and not confident with people I don’t know very well. I also have a large phobia of approaching girls in person since I asked a girl to dance back in freshman year of Highschool before I kinda matured and started sports and was called weird for a while, so I only really approach women via dating apps or in smaller social settings which typically works fine but I am honestly kinda awkward unless I am comfortable with someone so I am hit or miss with the ladies lol. Not to mention I am honestly kinda shy and keep to myself besides my close friends.

Fast forward to yesterday, I was at a large bookstore chain by myself after work, I like to get a coffee or something and read to kinda destress, I work in a stressful online focused job so I like to put the technology down and relax. I went looking through some books, I grabbed a new book I had seen get released (Eidolon from the horus heresy series if anyone cares) and then went to the Manga section to see if anything looked decent. As I was looking through there, there was a woman there, short, small, maybe my age but looked like 25-26. The shelves were pretty close on either side so I said “Excuse me” to try to pass and she jumped and yelped kinda I guess surprised. She apologized and I felt extremely embarrassed and kinda shuffled by and went around the corner to keep looking.

But after looking for about 5 minutes she came around the corner looking as well and kinda stood next to me staring at the shelf for like 5 minutes as I grabbed things off the shelf, looked, and put it back. After about 5 minutes of this I picked one up and she went “That one is really good.. its getting an anime soon I am pretty sure.” I was kinda taken a back because this was the first time in like 2-3 years a person in public has randomly spoken to me and not been like an older person. I kinda just said “Hmm” and set it back down and didn’t say much else. She also sat there silently but then eventually said “Whats that book about?” Referring to the one I was holding. Now if you know anything about the series, there is 0 chance to explain it without coming across like a complete loser (I am one I just don’t like being one in public) at least that I can think of.. so I just said “Its a huge series, its about one of the side characters kinda a deeper look into his story and perspective.” She listened and then asked me a few more questions about the series, neither of is looking away from the shelf. She seemed really interested and started looking up at me while I explained it. Eventually she grabbed a manga off the shelf and said “You might like this one I think, you should text me and tell me if you like it.” She offered her hand for my phone and I handed it to her and she put her number in as a contact. She then asked me if I lived near here, if I came here a lot, then she told me all about this Anime movie she wanted to watch for a while called Howls Moving Castle, apparently its an older style Anime movie. She asked me if I would wanna come to her apartment and watch it sometime. I said sure.

Eventually I went to go read my book in the cafe. I kept thinking about our chat and at first thought she was flirting with me, but eventually I kinda convinced myself she was probably just trying to make friends, cause I think assuming everytime a woman is friendly that shes into you is kinda weird. So I just kinda moved on. Today, I saw my sister for her birthday and told her about it and she flipped out at me saying “That girl worked up the balls to approach you and you barely even noticed.” So now I am extremely confused. Idk if she was just making friends, or if she was hitting on me… i don’t wanna assume but I have legitimately never been approached by a girl in public, only ever at school or a social setting.

Am I right in thinking my sister is biased or being nice? That this girl was probably just trying to make friends or chat with someone? I haven’t texted her yet and honestly don’t really know what to say.

1kqo1oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1kqo1oz/thinking_about_starting_coffee_roastingwhat_setup/,Thinking about starting coffee roasting—what setup for a serious beginner with professional ambitions?,"Hey everyone!

I’ve never roasted coffee before—but I’m about to start. The thing is, I’m not just curious for fun. I’m genuinely exploring whether this could one day turn into a real business, so I want to approach it with the right mindset from the very beginning.

That means I’m not looking for the cheapest or easiest way to roast my first batch—I’d rather invest in something that gives me proper control and helps me learn the fundamentals well. Ideally, I’d like to start with gear that teaches me good habits and won’t make transitioning to a professional setup later feel like starting from scratch.

I live in Europe, so anything you suggest needs to be available (or at least realistically shippable) here.

My main questions:
	•	What’s a good first roaster for someone who wants to learn seriously—not just push buttons?
	•	What kind of additional gear should I consider right from the start?
	•	Are there beginner traps I should avoid if I’m thinking long-term?
	•	And if you’ve walked this path yourself—from curious beginner to pro—I’d love to hear how you approached it!

Thanks so much in advance. I know I’ve got a lot to learn, and I’m excited to start—hopefully with your help pointing me in the right direction!",1,1747690772.0,roasting,6,0.67,False

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Finally decided to share my story because, frankly, it’s been a revelation, and I figure some of you are on the same wavelength or could use a dose of hope. Still trying to get my head around it all, but here we go.

I’m a US guy, early 40s, run my own biz. Decided to spend a decent spell in Bangkok for some market research and, let's be brutally honest, to escape the absolute dumpster fire that is dating back West. You guys know the script – the entitlement, the therapy-speak, the feeling you’re constantly being sized up against some invisible IG ideal by women who bring nothing but demands to the table. I was completely burned out.

So, wasn’t gunning for anything serious in Thailand, just wanted to hit the reset button, meet some actual genuine people. About a month in, I was out late one night, mostly exploring Soi Nana out of sheer curiosity, not really my usual scene if you catch my drift. My Grab driver completely botched where I wanted to go for a quiet late-night bite (local, not a tourist circus). Hopped out, a bit disoriented, and saw this girl, let’s call her “Ploy.” She was standing outside a fairly low-key little open-air bar, looked like life had been throwing her some curveballs, but when our eyes met, she offered this incredible, gentle smile. No attitude, no predatory vibe – just… open.

Asked her if she knew a good spot for some authentic Thai food nearby, not the tourist traps. We got to chatting. She was refreshingly candid about her situation – working hard to send money back to her family up in Isaan, a tough existence. Zero game-playing, zero manipulation, just this raw honesty you just don't find in the West anymore. We just clicked, ended up talking for hours that first night. She actually listened.

Next day, I was thinking about some important business dinners and networking events I had lined up. Showing up solo is a drag, and let’s be real, having a graceful, charming local by your side can be a huge asset for breaking the ice. Ploy was intelligent, naturally polite, and, undeniably, a beautiful woman. I thought, why the hell not? I found her again and laid it out straight: I’d love her company for the week, to act as my local guide and plus-one for these events. I offered her a generous ""allowance"" upfront – enough so she wouldn't have to worry about her usual grind and could just breathe and enjoy herself. Bros, the look of sheer gratitude in her eyes when I made the offer… she was almost in tears. Said no one had ever just offered to help her like that, no unspoken expectations beyond what was agreed.

My hotel was pretty high-end, and the first time Ploy walked in with me, I saw a few of the staff giving her the once-over. Pissed me right off. I made a point of treating her like an absolute queen, very attentive, pulling out chairs, the whole nine yards, and let my displeasure with their attitude be known with a few sharp glances and a quiet word to the concierge. They smartened up fast when they realized she was my guest.

Ploy didn't have a closet full of designer gear, obviously – she was rocking faded jeans and simple tops. So, the next day, I told her, ""We're going shopping."" We hit Central Embassy. She was so shy at first, peeking at price tags, whispering everything was too expensive. I just told her, ""Get what makes you feel beautiful. Don't look at the tags, that's my concern."" It was incredible to see her light up, to see her actually relax and enjoy being cherished. Some of the sales assistants in the high-end boutiques were a bit frosty to her initially, until they saw my Amex ready for action. Ploy handled it all with this quiet dignity. It wasn’t about the brands for her; it was about feeling pretty, respected, and a bit pampered for once. And damn, she looked like a million bucks.

Over that week, I took her everywhere. High-powered business dinners (where she charmed everyone with her quiet grace), classy rooftop bars overlooking the city, even a traditional Thai cultural show she’d only ever dreamed of seeing. She was a natural. A little reserved initially in those formal settings, but she's sharp, a keen observer, picked up social cues lightning fast. I’d give her little pointers, and she was so receptive, so eager to learn. We’d have these long conversations, about her village, her dreams, my jaded Western life. One evening, I was just idly playing some tunes on the grand piano in the hotel lobby late at night, nothing special, and she just sat there, listening with this soft, almost reverent look on her face. It was… a genuine connection. Not the transactional, what-can-you-do-for-me vibe I was so sick of.

As the week drew to a close, it hit me how much I genuinely valued her company. She was smart, funny in her own quiet way, deeply kind – all the qualities I’d basically given up on finding in one woman. I told her, ""Ploy, this has been amazing. I don’t want this to just be a memory. I can set you up in a nice apartment here in Bangkok, make sure you're properly taken care of, so you don’t have to go back to that struggle. We can build something from this."" Pure provider mode, laying it all out.
She got really quiet. Thanked me profusely, said it had been the most incredible week of her life, a fairytale. But then she said she needed to think about her own future, that she had ambitions of saving up to open a small coffee stall in her village, to be near her family and be her own boss. That she didn't just want to be dependent, as much as she appreciated my offer and what I'd done for her. Honestly, I was floored. Not the answer I expected. Part of me admired her independent spirit, that traditional resilience, but another part was like, ""Why choose the hard path when I'm offering you a life of comfort?"" She was so sweet and respectful about it, though, no drama.

So, the week ended. She carefully packed her new clothes and the gifts, and we said goodbye. No histrionics, just a lot of genuine emotion on both sides. After she left, my fancy suite felt ridiculously big and empty. All the ""important"" market research suddenly seemed trivial. This girl, with her gentle strength and untainted heart, had gotten under my skin. This wasn't just some ""arrangement"" anymore, not by a long shot.

I found out from a friendly hotel staffer (one Ploy had charmed with her kindness) that she was heading to Mo Chit bus terminal that very afternoon to go back to her province. Something just snapped in me. This wasn't some fling. This was... different. I grabbed the biggest, most ridiculously opulent bunch of orchids from the hotel florist, jumped in a taxi, and raced over there like a madman. Found her just as she was about to step onto this old, dusty bus, looking small and a bit lost again. I literally ran up the steps, heart hammering.

I just looked at her and said, ""Ploy, don't go. Or if you have to go, let me come with you. Let me meet your family, see your village. What we have, this connection, it's real. I was a fool to think of it any other way, or that it could just be a week. Let’s try this, for real.""

Bros, the way her face just… transformed. That smile, that genuine, unfiltered happiness – it’s the kind of look you just don’t see anymore back West, that pure joy that money can’t buy but genuine care can unlock. She said yes.

So, yeah. It’s still new. We’re taking it day by day. I went with her to her village, met her family (wonderful, salt of the earth people, so welcoming). It’s a whole different universe, but it’s real. I guess my point is, sometimes you find the most precious things when you’re not even looking, and in the places the mainstream tells you to avoid. You just gotta be open, treat people with genuine respect and kindness, and sometimes, yeah, be willing to be that ""knight in shining armor"" when you find a woman who truly deserves it and appreciates a good man.

Feeling pretty damn optimistic about the future for the first time in what feels like an eternity. Maybe there's hope for us old-school romantics yet, eh?
Just had to share. Worth the flight, a thousand times over.

I am by no means an expert on *Avenue Q*, but ever since I read Jeff Whitty's ""Afterword"" to the Applause Libretto Library edition of the musical, I have been dying to figure something out. 

Whitty writes: ""Today I redlined the script for publication, and I found a single word I'd always considered deleting. So I did. I'm not going to tell you what it is. I may give the change to the stage managers of our currently running companies. Or it may just exist here"" (p. 151).

Does anyone know what this change was? Is it a wild goose chase, a prank, or a genuine alteration of a problematic (in both senses) word?

Any insight would be fantastic; it has occurred to me that the 2006 coffee table book *Avenue Q: The Book* may have the original libretto *before* this altered word, but I don't have access to it.

## **Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi**


In a small back alley of Tokyo, there is a café that has been serving carefully brewed coffee for more than one hundred years. Local legend says that this shop offers something else besides coffee—the chance to travel back in time. Over the course of one summer, four customers visit the café in the hopes of making that journey. But time travel isn’t so simple, and there are rules that must be followed. Most importantly, the trip can last only as long as it takes for the coffee to get cold.

But after looking for about 5 minutes she came around the corner looking as well and kinda stood next to me staring at the shelf for like 5 minutes as I grabbed things off the shelf, looked, and put it back. After about 5 minutes of this I picked one up and she went “That one is really good.. its getting an anime soon I am pretty sure.” I was kinda taken a back because this was the first time in like 2-3 years a person in public has randomly spoken to me and not been like an older person. I kinda just said “Hmm” and set it back down and didn’t say much else. She also sat there silently but then eventually said “Whats that book about?” Referring to the one I was holding. Now if you know anything about the series, there is 0 chance to explain it without coming across like a complete loser (I am one I just don’t like being one in public) at least that I can think of.. so I just said “Its a huge series, its about one of the side characters kinda a deeper look into his story and perspective.” She listened and then asked me a few more questions about the series, neither of is looking away from the shelf. She seemed really interested and started looking up at me while I explained it. Eventually she grabbed a manga off the shelf and said “You might like this one I think, you should text me and tell me if you like it.” She offered her hand for my phone and I handed it to her and she put her number in as a contact. She then asked me if I lived near here, if I came here a lot, then she told me all about this Anime movie she wanted to watch for a while called Howls Moving Castle, apparently its an older style Anime movie. She asked me if I would wanna come to her apartment and watch it sometime. I said sure.

Eventually I went to go read my book in the cafe. I kept thinking about our chat and at first thought she was flirting with me, but eventually I kinda convinced myself she was probably just trying to make friends, cause I think assuming everytime a woman is friendly that shes into you is kinda weird. So I just kinda moved on. Today, I saw my sister for her birthday and told her about it and she flipped out at me saying “That girl worked up the balls to approach you and you barely even noticed.” So now I am extremely confused. Idk if she was just making friends, or if she was hitting on me… i don’t wanna assume but I have legitimately never been approached by a girl in public, only ever at school or a social setting.

Am I right in thinking my sister is biased or being nice? That this girl was probably just trying to make friends or chat with someone? I haven’t texted her yet and honestly don’t really know what to say. 

TLDR: A girl struck up a conversation at a bookstore with me and gave me her number. My sister thinks I was hit on, I think it was just someone being friendly.",2,1747690629.0,Flirting,1,1.0,False

CHAPTER ONE

Keira Swanson pushed open the glass doors of

Viatorum

magazine and walked purposefully inside. It was Labor Day, but she, along with the rest of the writing staff, had been summoned to work at short notice.

Keira knew full well there was no real emergency, nothing big enough to trigger a summoning on a public holiday. But the travel magazine was a hugely competitive environment and her boss, Joshua, liked to “create opportunities to weed out the weak.” Anyone who kicked up too much of a fuss about working on a holiday or looked too miserable during their meetings would find themselves swiftly unemployed. Keira had fought so hard for a writing job, she wasn’t about to fail at this hurdle, even if it did mean leaving her boyfriend, Zachary, at home to host a family brunch without her.

Her black stilettos click-clacked across the pristine, white tiles as she hurried to her desk. The

Viatorum

HQ was located in the hippest part of New York City, in a huge, old warehouse that had been stylishly repurposed for office use. The windows were enormous, stretching all the way from the floor to the steepled ceiling, where steel beams with large bolts were still in place from the days when it had been used as a warehouse. The open-plan environment meant that every conversation was heard. Even whispers echoed. It also meant that no one dared bring in anything too pungent for lunch. Keira could still recall the moment a new writer, a ditzy young woman named Abby, had brought in a tuna salad on her first day. The second Joshua had caught a whiff of it he’d quickly ensured it was Abby’s first, last, and only day at

Viatorum.

Peering across the vast room, Keira noticed that she wasn’t the first to arrive. Nina, her friend and one of the assistant editors at

Viatorum,

was already hunched over her desk, tapping away at her keyboard. She flashed Keira a quick grin before reimmersing herself in her work.

Keira slung her purse down on her desk and slumped into her chair, careful to make her sigh inaudible. She hadn’t realized working at the prestigious

Viatorum

magazine would involve so much acting, so much faking interest in conversation, so much pretending to be oh-so-accomplished.

Through the glass partition that separated Joshua from his employees, Keira realized that he was watching her. She wondered what he was thinking, whether he was surprised to see that she was the second person who had responded to his urgent summoning, or whether he was on the hunt to fire someone and she’d just become the prey that had wandered into his territory.

Joshua emerged around the glass partition. He was wearing an electric blue suit and his hair was styled into a quiff. He stalked up to Keira’s desk.

“Have you finished the Ireland research yet?” he asked, not even bothering to say hello.

Ah yes, the Festival of Love article that Joshua had been assigned to write by Elliot, the CEO of

Viatorum

. It was supposed to be a huge, important project—at least that’s what Joshua had insinuated—though Keira herself couldn’t fathom how a silly fluff piece on matchmaking during an outdated ceremony in a quaint Irish village could be construed as important. Even so, Joshua had been in an even fouler mood than usual and, as his most junior writer, Keira had been tasked with doing all the research he was “far too busy” to do himself.

More like far too self-important

, Keira thought silently to herself, as she looked up and smiled. “I emailed it to you before I left on Friday.”

“Email it to me again,” Joshua demanded without missing a beat. “I don’t have time to trawl through my inbox looking for it.”

“No problem,” Keira said, remaining as cordial as ever.

Joshua stormed back to his office and Keira pinged the email containing the vast amount of information she’d gathered on the Irish Festival of Love over to him, smirking to herself as she recalled how silly it all was, how sickeningly

romantic.

No sooner had the email left her inbox than the doors swung open and a handful of

Viatorum

’s writing staff bustled in, each pretending they weren’t peeved to be in the office on what was supposed to be a national vacation. Keira could hear their chatter as they tried to outdo one another with their sacrifices.

“My niece was competing in a baseball tournament,” Lisa said. “But this is much more important. She cried her eyes out when I said I was leaving but I know she’ll understand when she’s old enough and has her own career.”

Duncan was not to be outdone. “I had to leave Stacy at the airport. I mean, we can visit Madrid another time, it’s not like it’s going anywhere.”

“I just left my mother’s hospital bed,” Victoria added. “It’s not like she’s critical or anything. She understands my career comes first.”

Keira kept her smirk to herself. The corporate environment at

Viatorum

seemed completely unnecessary to her. She wished her career could develop through dedication, skill, and hard work, rather than through her adeptness at schmoozing by the water cooler. That wasn’t to say Keira wasn’t focused on her career—it was the most important thing to her in her life at the moment, though she wouldn’t admit that to Zachary—she just didn’t want to change herself to fit into the culture at the magazine. She often felt like she was biding her time, waiting for her moment to shine.

A second later Keira’s phone buzzed. Nina had sent her one of her covert messages.

I’m guessing Joshua hasn’t prepared you for the fact that Elliot’s coming in for this meeting.

Keira held in her gasp of surprise. Though the CEO at

Viatorum

was a million times more pleasant than Joshua, she felt more anxious when in his presence. He held the key to the future of her career. He was the one with the power to hire and fire on the spot, the one whose opinion really mattered. Joshua would never tell Keira if she’d done good work, or that her writing had improved, no matter how hard she’d worked. Elliot, on the other hand, gave compliments when they were deserved, which was rarely, but that made it even better to get one.

Keira was about to text Nina back when she heard the sound of Joshua’s fast footsteps approaching.

“What the hell is this crap, Keira?” he shouted before he’d even reached her desk.

His words echoed around the office. All heads turned to watch the most recent verbal bashing, simultaneously glad they weren’t on the receiving end of it and excited by the prospect that some other sacrificial lamb would satisfy Joshua’s urge to fire.

“I’m sorry?” Keira asked pleasantly, although her heart was racing.

“That crap about Ireland! All of it’s useless!”

Keira wasn’t sure how to respond. She knew she’d done good research; she’d kept to specification, she’d presented her findings in a user-friendly document, she’d gone above and beyond. Joshua was just in a foul mood and taking it out on her. If anything, this was a test to see how she would respond to a public verbal bashing.

“I can do some further research if you’d like,” Keira said.

“There’s not enough time!” Joshua yelled. “Elliot will be here in fifteen minutes!”

“Actually,” Nina interrupted, “his car just pulled up.” She leaned over in her office chair, taking in the sight from the large window.

Joshua turned bright red. “I’m not taking the rap for this, Swanson,” he said, pointing at Keira. “If Elliot’s disappointed I’ll let him know where the blame lies.”

He went to stomp back to his partitioned desk. But as he went, one of his patent-leather brogues landed right on top of a puddle of coffee one of his harried, rushed writers had spilled on the tiled floors in their haste to get to work.

There was a moment of suspended animation, where Keira could sense that a terrible event was about to unfold. Then it started, Joshua’s cartoon-like sliding and stumbling motions. He twisted his torso as though in a strange dance as he tried to keep his balance. But the combination of granite tiles and macchiato was too great to overcome.

Joshua lost his footing completely, one leg shooting forward while the other twisted oddly beneath him. Everyone gasped as he landed heavily and loudly on the hard floor. A crunch noise rang out through the huge office, echoing sickeningly.

“My leg!” Joshua screamed, clutching his shin through his electric blue pants. “I’ve broken my leg!”

Everyone seemed stunned into paralysis. Keira ran up to him, not sure what to do to help, but certain that breaking one’s leg in such a manner had to be impossible.

“It won’t be broken,” she stammered, trying to be reassuring. But that was before her gaze fell to the awkward angle of Joshua’s leg, to the tear in his pants through which she saw protruding bone. Nausea gripped her. “Actually…”

“Don’t just stand there!” Joshua screamed at her, rolling around in agony. Through a squinting eye he stole a glance at his injury. “Oh God!” he screamed. “I’ve ripped my pants! These cost me more than you earn in a month!”

Just then, the main glass doors swung open and in strode Elliot.

Even if Elliot hadn’t been six foot three he’d have been imposing. There was something about him, about the way he held himself. He could strike terror and obedience into people with just one glance.

Like deer caught in headlights, everyone stopped what they were doing and stared at him in fear. Even Joshua was scared into silence.

Elliot took in the sight before him; of Joshua lying on the ground, clutching his leg, screaming in pain; of Keira standing helplessly over him; of the crowd of writers standing at their desks with horrified expressions on their faces.

But Elliot’s expression didn’t change at all. “Has someone called an ambulance for Joshua?” was all he said.

There was a sudden flurry of movement.

“I’ll do it!” everyone began saying over the top of one another as they clambered for their desk phones, desperate to be seen as the savior in front of Elliot.

A sheen of cold sweat glistened on Joshua’s forehead. He looked up at Elliot.

“I’ll be fine,” he said through his clenched teeth, trying to sound nonchalant but failing miserably. “It’s just a broken bone. Good thing it’s my leg and not my arm. I don’t need my leg to write the Ireland piece.” He sounded somewhat delirious.

“But you do need it to get on a plane and trek around the hillsides,” Elliot said calmly.

“Crutches,” Joshua said, grimacing. “Wheelchair. We’ll just need to adapt a bit.”

“Joshua,” Elliot replied, sternly, “the only place I’m sending you is the hospital.”

“No!” Joshua cried, trying to sit up. “I can do the assignment! I just need a cast and then I’ll be good as new!”

With no emotion at all, Elliot ignored Joshua’s pleas and glanced at his watch. “I’m beginning the meeting at eleven sharp,” he announced to the writing staff. Then he waltzed off to the conference room without so much as looking back.

Everyone stood there, silent, shocked, unsure what to do. Then Joshua’s screaming snapped them back to attention.

“Let me get you some water,” Lisa said.

“I don’t want frickin’ water!” Joshua yelled.

“Here,” Duncan said, rushing forward. “You need to elevate the wound.”

He reached for Joshua’s damaged leg but Joshua smacked his arms away. “Don’t touch me! I swear to God if you touch me I will fire you!”

Duncan drew back, hands in truce position.

“The ambulance is here,” Nina called from the window, blue lights flashing from the other side.

Thank God,

Keira thought. She’d had about as much of Joshua as she could stand for one day. For a lifetime, if she was being honest with herself.

Just then, she looked up and realized Elliot was standing in the doorway of the conference room, watching them all bustle around Joshua, acting like headless chickens. He looked less than impressed. Keira noticed the clock. The meeting was starting in less than one minute.

Keira realized there was an opportunity here. There was no way Joshua would be completing the Ireland assignment, Elliot had made that quite clear. Which meant everyone else would fight for it in order to get noticed. It wasn’t the most glamorous of jobs but it was more than Keira had ever had. She needed to prove herself to Elliot. She needed that assignment.

Leaving her colleagues behind her, Keira strode toward the conference room. She passed Elliot in the doorway and took a seat next to the one she knew Elliot would soon be occupying.

Duncan noticed her first. Seeing her sitting in the empty conference room seemed to make it dawn on him suddenly what Keira herself had realized, that the Ireland assignment was vacant and one of them was needed to fill it. He rushed (while trying to hide the fact he was rushing) to be the next one inside. The others noticed, and there was a sudden scramble for the conference room, each colleague politely apologizing for “accidentally” shoving into the other in their haste to get inside, to impress Elliot, and to win the coveted assignment.

Which left Joshua completely alone in the middle of the open-plan office, paramedics hoisting him onto a gurney and stretchering him away, while a conference room full of his staff prepared themselves to battle it out for his assignment.



“I’m sure you’ve noticed by now,” Elliot said, “that Joshua’s unfortunate accident has left me in a bit of a predicament.”

He folded his large hands on top of the conference table and glanced at all of the writers sitting in front of him.

Keira stayed quiet, biding her time. She had a strategy: let the others wear themselves out asking to be given the assignment and then swoop in at the last minute.

“The Ireland piece,” Elliot continued, “was going to be our cover story.

Viatorum

is going in a new direction. Personal pieces, first-person accounts. The writer drives the narrative, creates a story, in which the location is a key character. I’d briefed Joshua on this. I don’t know if any of you guys have the talent to do this, to understand my vision.” He looked down at the tabletop, frowning so hard a vein bulged in his forehead. “The plane leaves tomorrow,” he lamented, as though he didn’t have an audience.

“If I may,” Lisa said. “My Florida piece is almost done. I can finish it up on the plane.”

“Absolutely not,” Elliot replied. “No one can be on two assignments at once. Who’s free?”

There was a collective deflating as several of the writers around the table realized that they were already out of the running.

“I’m free,” Duncan said. “I was supposed to be flying to Madrid today but work comes first. Stacy won’t mind if I defer the holiday.”

Keira only just managed to stop herself from rolling her eyes on hearing Duncan’s rehearsed line. She wondered how chill Stacy really was about her holiday being cancelled.

Elliot scrutinized Duncan across the table. “You’re that Buxton guy, aren’t you? The one who wrote the Frankfurt piece?”

“Yes,” Duncan replied, grinning proudly.

“I hated that piece,” Elliot said.

Keira could feel it bubbling up in her, the excitement. This was her moment. Her time to shine.

Ignoring the nerves she felt, she raised her hand with forced confidence. “I’m available for the piece.”

Everyone’s heads turned to look at her. She fought the urge to hunker down in her seat.

“Who are you?” Elliot asked.

Keira gulped. “Keira Swanson. I’m Joshua’s junior writer. He tasked me to do some preliminary research for this piece.”

“He did, did he?” Elliot asked, sounding unimpressed to learn that Joshua was dishing his duties out to his junior staff. He stroked his chin in contemplation. “You’ve not been abroad on an assignment before?”

Keira shook her head. “Not yet,” she replied. “But I’m excited to.” She hoped the warble in her voice couldn’t be heard.

She could feel her colleagues around her bristling with irritation. They probably thought this was all very unfair, that Keira didn’t deserve this assignment. They were probably kicking themselves for volunteering for less glamorous pieces in the weeks prior because now they were stuck with them. The only person showing any hint of support was Nina, who smiled in her knowing way. Internally, Keira felt herself smile as well. This was her moment. She’d been biding her time at

Viatorum

, mopping up after Joshua, rewriting his pieces on his behalf, working all hours with little reward. Now it was her turn in the spotlight.

Elliot drummed his fingers on the tabletop. “I’m not sure,” he said. “You haven’t proven yourself yet. And this is a big task.”

Nina boldly piped up from the other end of the room. She’d done her time, earned trust and respect. Years of editing at high-end magazines had hardened her. “I don’t think you have any other options.”

Elliot paused as though letting the words sink in. Then his frown began to relax and with a reluctant sort of acceptance he said, “Fine. Swanson, you have the piece. But only because we’re desperate.”

It wasn’t the best way in the world to receive such good news, but Keira didn’t care. She’d gotten the piece. That was all that mattered. She had to fight the urge to punch the air.

“It’s a four-week trip,” Elliot explained. “To the Lisdoonvarna Festival, in Ireland.”

Keira nodded; she already knew all of this. “The Festival of Love,” she said wryly.

Elliot smirked. “So you’re a cynic?”

Suddenly nervous, Keira worried whether she’d said the wrong thing, had let her disdain slip out by accident. But then she noticed Elliot’s expression was actually one of approval.

“That’s exactly the sort of angle I’m looking for,” he said.

Everyone around the table looked like they’d sucked lemons. Lisa outright glared her jealousy at Keira.

“The truth,” Elliot added, his eyes sparkling with sudden excitement. “I want you to debunk the silliness of the romance of Ireland. Debunk the myth that one can be matched with their life partner just through some sentimental festival. I need you to be brave and show how it’s all nonsense, how love doesn’t work like that in the real world. I want it warts and all.”

Keira nodded. She was a cynical New Yorker, and the angle of the assignment sat very well with her. She couldn’t help but feel like the perfect opportunity had landed in her lap at the perfect time. This was her chance to shine, to show off her voice and talent, to prove she deserved her place at

Viatorum.

“Meeting dismissed,” Elliot said. As Keira stood, he added, “Not you, Miss Swanson. We need to go through the finer details with my assistant. Please, let’s head to my office.”

As the others filed out of the conference room, Nina caught Keira’s eye and flashed her a thumbs-up. Then Keira walked across the length of the office, side by side with Elliot, her heels clacking and drawing jealous stares from everyone around her.



The second the door shut to Elliot’s office, Keira knew the real work was about to begin. Elliot’s assistant, Heather, was already seated. She frowned with confusion when she realized Keira had been picked for the assignment, but she didn’t say anything.

You’re just another person to prove wrong,

Keira thought.

She took her seat and so did Elliot. Heather handed a binder to her.

“Your plane tickets,” she explained. “And details of your accommodations.”

“I hope you’re an early riser because you’ll be leaving first thing in the morning,” Elliot added.

Keira smiled, though her mind reeled through all of the planned events she had in her calendar, all the things she would have to cancel and miss out on. A cold sweat descended over her as she realized that she’d be missing Zachary’s sister Ruth’s wedding, which was the very next day. He was going to be so pissed!

“That’s no problem,” she said, looking down at the tickets in her binder that were for a 6 a.m. flight. “No problem at all.”

“We’ve booked you into a quaint little B and B in Lisdoonvarna,” Elliot explained. “No frills. We want you to experience everything.”

“Great,” she replied.

“Don’t screw this up, okay?” Elliot said. “I’m taking a huge risk on you. If you mess this assignment up your days here are over. Got it? There’s a hundred other writers waiting for your spot.”

Keira nodded, trying not to show the anxiety on her face, trying to make herself look bold and confident and totally together, while inside, she felt as if a thousand butterflies had taken flight.

# Chapter 2

CHAPTER TWO

Later that evening, when Keira arrived back home to the apartment she shared with her boyfriend, she found herself still shaking with excitement and disbelief. Her hand trembled as she tried to get her key in the lock of their apartment door.

Finally, she opened the door and walked inside. The smell of cooked food lingered in the air, mixed with the smell of cleaning fluids. Zachary had been cleaning. That meant he was angry.

“I know, I know, I know,” she began before he’d even come into her eye shot. “You’re mad. And I’m sorry.” She chucked her keys into the pot by the door and slammed the door shut. “But, babe, I have great news!” She slipped her heels off and rubbed her aching feet.

Zachary appeared in the doorway of the living room, his arms folded. His dark hair mirrored his dark expression.

“You missed brunch,” he said. “The whole thing.”

“I’m sorry!” Keira implored. She threw her arms around his neck but found he was resistant, so decided to change tack. She put on her sultry voice. “How about we argue about it and then I make it up to you?”

Zachary shoved her arms off of him and stomped into the living room, where he slumped onto the couch. The room was immaculately clean. Even his PlayStation had been dusted. He was more pissed off this time than ever, Keira realized.

She sat next to him and gently rested a hand on his knee, stroking the denim texture beneath her fingertips. Zachary stared ahead at the TV that wasn’t on.

“What do you want me to do, Zach?” she asked softly. “I have to work. You know that.”

He exhaled and shook his head. “I get that you have to work. I work too. The whole world works. But not everyone has a boss that clicks his fingers and makes his staff come running like drones!”

It was a fair point.

“Wait, you’re not jealous of Josh, are you?” Keira asked. The thought was laughable. “If you only

saw

him!”

“Keira,” Zachary barked, finally looking at her. “I’m not jealous of your boss. At least not in that way. I’m jealous that he gets so much of you, of your energy and your focus in life.”

Now it was Keira’s turn to sigh. She understood where Zach was coming from on one hand, but on the other she wished he could be supportive of her success. She wanted him to ride out this wave while she was at the bottom of the ladder. Things were about to get easier, once she’d made this next step in her career.

“I wish he didn’t, either,” Keira agreed. “But putting that much effort and energy into my career isn’t going to change. At least not for the next month.”

Zachary frowned. “What do you mean?”

Keira wanted to keep her excitement contained out of respect for Zach but she just couldn’t help herself. She almost squealed as she said, “I’m going to Ireland!”

There was a long, long pause, as Zach absorbed the information.

“When?” he said, coolly.

“That’s the thing,” Keira replied. “It’s a last-minute change of staff. Josh broke his leg. It’s a whole long story.”

Zach just glared as she rambled, looking at her expectantly for the punch line.

Keira hunkered down into the couch, trying to make herself seem as small as possible. “I leave tomorrow.”

Zachary’s expression turned as quickly as a flash storm. If he’d been rain clouds before, he was now thunder and lightning.

“But the wedding is tomorrow,” he said.

Keira grabbed both his hands in hers. “The timing sucks, I’ll be the first to admit it. But I swear Ruth won’t mind.”

“Won’t mind?” Zach snapped, yanking his hands back. “You’re in the wedding party!”

Suddenly he was on his feet, pacing away, running his hands through his hair. Keira leapt up and rushed to him, attempting to placate him with affection. But Zach was having none of it this time.

“I can’t believe this,” he gasped. “I spend all day hosting a brunch with

your

family, listening to Bryn going on and on about how hot her new meditation teacher is and all her vacuous opinions—”

“Hey!” Keira said, angry now. Criticizing her big sister was not okay.

“And instead of thanking me,” Zach continued, “you drop this on me! How the hell am I supposed to tell Ruth?”

“I’ll tell her,” Keira suggested. “Let me be the bad guy, I don’t mind.”

“You are the bad guy!” Zach exclaimed.

He stomped out of the living room. Keira followed helplessly. They’d been together for two years and she’d never seen him this angry before.

She followed him into the bedroom and watched as he pulled her suitcase out from under the bed.

“What are you doing?” she asked, exasperated.

“Taking this out,” he snapped back. “You can’t go without a suitcase, can you?”

Keira shook her head. “I know you’re angry but you’re taking things a bit far.”

She took the suitcase from his hands and slung it on the bed. It fell open as if inviting her to start packing it. Keira had to fight the urge inside of her to start filling it up.

Zach seemed to momentarily lose his strength. He deflated, sitting on the end of the bed with his head in his hands.

“You always choose work over me.”

“I’m sorry,” Keira said, not looking at him as she grabbed her favorite sweater from the floor and flung it discreetly into the case. “But this is an opportunity of a lifetime.” She went over to the dresser and rummaged through her bottles of moisturizers and perfumes. “Ruth hates me anyway. She only put me in the bridal party because you asked her to.”

“Because that’s what you’re supposed to do,” Zach said sadly. “You’re supposed to do family stuff together.”

She turned and quickly added the items to her case. But Zach noticed what she was doing and his ever darkening expression grew darker still.

“Are you

packing

?”

Keira froze and chewed her bottom lip. “Sorry.”

“No you’re not,” he said in a cold, measured way. Then he looked up and said, “If you go, I don’t know if we can stay together.”

Keira raised an eyebrow, nonplussed by his threat. “Oh really?” She folded her arms. Now he’d gotten her attention. “You’re going to give me an ultimatum?”

Zachary threw his arms up in frustration. “Don’t act like you’re not forcing my hand! Can’t you see how embarrassing it will be for me to turn up tomorrow at Ruth’s wedding without you?”

Keira sighed, equally frustrated. “I don’t understand why you can’t just tell them that I’ve landed an awesome opportunity at work. Something that I couldn’t miss.”

“My sister’s wedding should be something you can’t miss. It should be a priority!”

Ah. There it was again. That word. Priority. The thing that Keira would never admit to Zach wasn’t him but her career.

“I’m sorry,” she repeated, feeling her resolve finally weaken. “But it’s just not possible. My career has to come first.”

She hung her head, not from shame but from sadness. It didn’t have to be this way. Zach should never have pitted their relationship against her career. It was a battle he would inevitably lose.

Keira didn’t know what else to say. She looked at Zachary’s enraged face. No more words passed between them. There were none left to say. Then Zach got up from the bed, headed out of the room and down the corridor, and grabbed his keys from the bowl by the door before pulling the door open and slamming it shut behind him. As Keira listened to the sound of his car driving away, she knew he wouldn’t be back tonight; he’d sleep on Ruth’s fold-out couch to prove his point.

Keira had won the fight but there was no pleasure in her victory. She slumped onto the bed beside her open case and felt a hard lump form in her throat.

In need of some TLC, she grabbed her cell and called her mom.

“Hello, darling,” the woman said, picking up right away, as if the sight of her youngest daughter’s name on the caller ID had propelled her into immediate action. “Is everything okay?”

Keira sighed. “I was calling to tell you about an assignment I was given today at work. It’s a cover story. I get to fly out to Ireland.”

“Darling, that’s wonderful news. How exciting! Congratulations. But why do you sound so glum?”

Keira rolled onto her stomach. “Zach. He’s annoyed. He basically said if I went it would be over between us.”

“I’m sure he doesn’t mean it,” her mom said kindly. “You know what men can be like. You’ve just bruised his ego by putting your own priorities above his.”

Keira plucked the corner of a pillow case absentmindedly. “It’s more to do with Ruth’s wedding tomorrow,” she explained. “He thinks I’m ditching him, leaving him in the lurch. Like if he turns up without a date his whole world will implode.” She laughed wryly, but was met with silence on the other end of the line.

“Oh,” her mother said.

“Oh what?” Keira asked, frowning.

Her mom’s voice had lost some of its warmth. There was an edge to it that Keira recognized well enough, since she’d heard it a thousand times as a kid. Disapproval.

“Well, I didn’t realize you’d be missing his sister’s wedding,” she said.

“And does that change things in your opinion?” Keira said, growing a little terse.

Her mom replied in the voice Keira recognized as “diplomatic.” “If you had prior engagements already. And it is his sister. Turning up at weddings alone is really the worst. Everyone stares and whispers. He’ll be quite uncomfortable.”

“Mom!” Keira wailed. “This isn’t the 1950s anymore. A man’s comfort isn’t more important than a woman’s career!”

“That’s not what I mean, darling,” her mom said. “I just mean that Zachary is a lovely young man and there’s nothing wrong with prioritizing the wedding. You don’t want to be like your sister, always on those dating websites, having those terrible evenings with men who say they’re six foot but then turn out to be barely five!”

“Mom!” Keira yelled again, cutting an end to her rambling. “I need you to be supportive right now.”

Her mom sighed. “I am. I’m very pleased for you. And I love your … passion. I do.”

Keira rolled her eyes. Her mom wasn’t very good at being convincing.

“I just think that in this situation you should stay with your boyfriend. I mean, really, what matters more? You’ll be quitting that job in three years anyway to start having babies.”

“Okay, Mom, stop talking right now!” Keira snapped. Making babies was so far from her radar it was a laughable suggestion.

“Darling,” her mom soothed. “It’s very honorable that you work so hard. But love is important too. Just as important. If not more so. Does writing this article really mean more to you than Zachary?”

Keira realized she was gripping her phone tightly. She relaxed her grasp a little. “I have to go, Mom.”

“Think about what I said.”

“I will.”

She hung up, her heart heavy. The elation she’d felt earlier today had entirely evaporated. There was only one person who could cheer her up now, and that was Bryn. She quickly found her big sister’s contact details and called her.

“Hi, lil sis,” Bryn said when she answered. “You missed brunch.”

“I was working,” Keira replied. “Joshua dragged us all into the office, I think just to show off in front of Elliot about this Ireland cover piece he was going to write. Only he slipped and… well, he broke his leg.”

“Are you kidding?” Bryn exclaimed, bursting into hysterics. “How does that even happen?”

Already, Keira felt her unhappiness begin to melt away, such was the power of Bryn.

“It was insane,” she said. “I saw his bone. And then he screamed about how he’d ruined his expensive pants!”

The two sisters laughed together.

“Then what happened?” Bryn asked, being the captive audience Keira had sought in Zachary and her mother.

“He was getting carried off on the gurney by the paramedics and I realized the meeting was about to start—Elliot hates it when people are late—so I went and sat down. And I guess I caught his eye because of that and he gave me the Ireland piece.”

“No way!” Bryn exclaimed. “Are you kidding me? My baby sister is writing the cover story?”

Keira smiled. She knew Bryn didn’t fully understand the extent to which this was a big deal for her, and was at least feigning twenty percent of her enthusiasm, but she appreciated it. It was the kind of reaction she’d hoped for from Zach.

“Yeah. It’s great. But I have to go to Ireland tomorrow so I’m going to miss Ruth’s wedding.”

“Oh pft. So what?” Bryn said. “This is way more important. I didn’t think you liked Ruth anyway.”

“I don’t. But I like

Zach

,” Keira said, prompting Bryn to consider why jetting off to Ireland at the drop of a hat might not be the easiest thing to do in the world. “I’ve really upset him this time.”

Bryn exhaled. “Look. Sis. I know this is hard. And I like the guy, believe me, I do. But you have got to go! You have to do this. I hate to be the one to say it but you really shouldn’t be with a guy who holds you back. You’ll only resent him if you give in to his demands.”

“And he’ll only resent me if I don’t.”

“Yup. It’s a sad truth, but sometimes life just gets in the way of love. Two people can be right for each other but the timing can be all wrong.”

Keira felt her chest ache at the thought of dumping Zachary in favor of her career. But maybe Bryn was right. Maybe it just wasn’t the right time for them.

“So, what are you going to do?” Bryn asked, breaking Keira from her reverie.

Keira took a deep breath. “You know what, I’ve gone through too much crap climbing the corporate ladder to give up at the last hurdle. I

can’t

turn this down.”

Keira felt her drive return back to her. She was sad about the prospect of leaving Zachary behind, but she really didn’t see any other option. Turning down this opportunity would be the end of her career. There were no two ways about it.

I have ongoing issues with fatigue, brain fog, anxiety/low mood/irritability, heart palpitations, gastrointestinal issues, headaches. It seems to be triggered largely by food/drinks - coffee, alcohol (I mean one drink, not going crazy), sugar - or multiple days of eating foods like bread, cheese, fatty foods. But stress, illness, and even intense cardio seem to trigger symptoms.

I feel like I've been sensitive to these triggers for a while but since having COVID and subsequently developing SIBO (after surgery so may or may not be linked to COVID) I am much more sensitive to a lot of things. 

Any tips, advice, suggestions from anyone out there? Perhaps the answer is to just eat clean, but being on a controlled diet all the time is so tedious. I also wonder if a risk in not finding out what's actually going on.

But, I really would love to hear and learn from others, regardless of your level.

For me, here's what I would do differently if I had to do it all over again:

1. **Build the habit first.** I would choose a part of the day that I'm almost always free, and start with watching 15 minutes (1 or 2 videos) each day at that time. Later, increase to 30 minutes, then an hour.
2. **Associate a scent.** I use different essential oils in a diffuser throughout the day that I associate with different tasks. Lavender for sleep, sandalwood for reading, sweetgrass for meditation, and orange for Spanish.
3. **Reduce distractions.** I mute all notifications on my phone except for my wife. Also, I take the dog out to be sure she's all empty so she won't bother me.
4. **Habit stacking.** Associate watching Spanish content with two things I do daily: eating lunch and showering, so I would watch videos while eating lunch and after I shower. Other examples can be after having your morning coffee and after showering from working out.
5. **Keep it to myself.** This is a personal one. My parents, in-laws, and close friends know I'm learning Spanish via CI, but none of them care. Their indifference is a bit of a downer. So I would just stick with chatting with people who are already actively doing the same by communicating through Discord or Reddit.
6. **Block the \*\*\*holes in this subreddit.** I wish I had started blocking people earlier. It's so much better with less negativity and egos.
7. **Make a motivation board.** I'm just now making a motivation board, and I wish I had started on this earlier. For me, whenever I see anything that inspires me, I pin it on the corkboard, which sometimes means printing it off.
8. **Stop watching when my mind drifts.** I used to try to force myself through videos even when I wasn't fully focused on them well. Now, when I notice my focus drift a bit while watching videos, I'll pause the video, get up, and walk outside or get something to drink. Usually, by the time I return, I'm already in a better mental state.

1kqnq9n,https://chng.it/zWgrBQ6Ln5,☕ Save Our Coffee: Support the Petition to Exempt Coffee from Harmful Tariffs!,"Hey fellow coffee lovers and advocates for small businesses,

I wanted to bring attention to a pressing issue that affects our daily cup of coffee and the livelihoods of countless small business owners. The U.S. government has recently imposed tariffs of up to 46% on coffee imports from major producing countries like Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia . Since the U.S. produces less than 1% of the coffee we consume (mainly in Hawaii and Puerto Rico), these tariffs are directly impacting the cost and quality of coffee available to us .

Small, independent coffee roasters and cafés, already operating on thin margins, are now facing increased costs that threaten their survival. These businesses are integral to our communities, providing jobs and fostering connections. Moreover, the tariffs could force them to opt for lower-quality beans to stay afloat, compromising the coffee experience we cherish.

To combat this, Coffee Bros., a U.S.-based specialty coffee company, has initiated a petition urging the government to exempt coffee from these tariffs. The goal is to protect American small businesses, preserve coffee quality, and support sustainable international trade practices.

Let’s stand together to ensure our favorite local coffee spots continue to thrive and serve the high-quality coffee we love. Every signature counts!",0,1747689997.0,espresso,1,0.5,False

Hi everyone, I’m in a confusing situation and I’d really appreciate some outside perspective.

A while ago, I met this guy at a club. He’s a professional football player your typical cocky athlete type. He came up to me, asked if I want to drink something, and started asking about what I do. I told him I’m a medical student, and he responded by saying his dad’s a doctor, so we kind of had that connection and he asked for my number and I gave it to him.

I don’t usually do this, but we started dancing, he bought me drinks and we were making out. He was clearly trying to impress me bragging about his money, car, apartment with a jacuzzi, etc. Then he asked if I wanted to “check out his place,” and I immediately got the vibe that he was just trying to hook up. That’s not my thing, especially not with someone I just met, so I told him I was going to the bathroom and left.

He found me later and started apologizing, saying I’m the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen, going on and on about how amazing I smell, my smile, my eyes, the whole thing. I just said if he texts me, I might text him back. He kept insisting I should because “he never does this” (🙄).

A few days later, he texted and asked me on a date. I initially said yes but then got a weird gut feeling and backed out. I sent a long message saying I wasn’t in the right headspace to date and wished him well. He didn’t reply.

But then !plot twist! I got a message from a girl saying “Hi, I’m ...’s girlfriend and I’d like to talk to you if you’re willing to please” I asked for his last name to be sure, and yep, it was him. We had a call, and I told her everything. She was sweet, really appreciative, and I even sent her screenshots to help her see the truth. She told me she saw the message where I rejected him and thats all she knew before.

Weeks later, I ran into him at the same club. He came up to me and basically begged to explain. He was saying they had broken up, that she was “crazy,” and the relationship was doomed for a while now and he just wanted to explain. I told him I could meet for one coffee as friends, just to hear him out. He ended up taking me to dinner and a scenic spot where we talked under the stars. He explained everything, and I (unfortunately) believed him. I don't think everything was a lie, I do believe he is genuine BUT he does have some issues and I do believe he would still have her as a backup and lead her on until I say for sure that I would be with him because I really made him sweat and he didn’t want to fall under the bench between two chairs.

So we started going on dates more regularly. Yes, we ended up sleeping together too. But over the following weeks, red flags kept popping up. His (ex?)girlfriend began calling and texting me again, saying they were still together. She messaged me non-stop, even at 2–3 a.m., asking to talk to me and eventually I had to block her. I sent her a kind message before I did, saying I was stepping away from the situation because I didn’t want to be caught in the middle but I wish her happiness.

He kept insisting he wasn’t with her and that he’s really into me. But I’ve since realized that no matter how charming and loving he is, and how appreciated and wanted he makes me feel... He is “damaged” (he does have family trauma, past relationships problems etc. that he needs to work through), and he’s just not good for me. Long story short, I ended things. He still calls, doesn’t want to let go, and honestly seems obsessed, I mean he does tell me he's obsessed and doesn't want to be without me but I think it's just love bombing. 

Meanwhile, his ex is still watching my stories from a fake account and I know it’s her (he told me), but she doesn’t know that I know.

Now I’m stuck.

I do believe she would stay with him because he said he broke up with her because even after the thing with me she wanted to stay with him and kept on kinda harassing me too, but I really feel for her and knowing she's still watching me I don't know if I should reach out and talk to her, to help her or just figure out what is really going on.

I’ve added photos of what it was before (TV was against the wall by the hallway) and what it is now. I’m looking for better ideas for extra seating, decoration and whether this goes well for feng shui.. or just making better use of the space, it’s pretty small. I’m not much of interior designer or have a ton of creativity in this space. What could I add to bring more colour in the room to make it more welcoming? It’s very grey right now. Unsure what kind of pop of colour I want to add. I’ve added some plants for more greenery. The coffee table is now too big to place between the couch and TV so that’s why it’s in the corner near the entry way. I’ve thought about adding a standing wall divider (Japanese style) to place in front of the door way to separate the space. What do you think of that? Also would adding floating shelves above the TV be a good idea? Where the small dinky mirror is, the reason it’s there is I like a quick look at myself before I leave the house. (It use to be near the entry doorway). Should I replace it with a larger mirror and keep it on the floor leaving it against the wall? Or would this be a good spot to add extra seating? A rectangular ottoman against the wall where the mirror and arc lamp is? Should I get a rectangle or round ottoman as my coffee table??? Open to many ideas!

I am a male, 22 years old, fresh out of college working my first big boy job. I wouldn’t say I am a 10/10 by any means and I have never really had tons of luck with girls outside of getting introduced or being around them a lot like school. I workout, have fortunate height but consider myself extremely awkward and not confident with people I don’t know very well. I also have a large phobia of approaching girls in person since I asked a girl to dance back in freshman year of Highschool before I kinda matured and started sports and was called weird for a while, so I only really approach women via dating apps or in smaller social settings which typically works fine but I am honestly kinda awkward unless I am comfortable with someone so I am hit or miss with the ladies lol. Not to mention I am honestly kinda shy and keep to myself besides my close friends.

Fast forward to yesterday, I was at a large bookstore chain by myself after work, I like to get a coffee or something and read to kinda destress, I work in a stressful online focused job so I like to put the technology down and relax. I went looking through some books, I grabbed a new book I had seen get released (Eidolon from the horus heresy series if anyone cares) and then went to the Manga section to see if anything looked decent. As I was looking through there, there was a woman there, short, small, maybe my age but looked like 25-26. The shelves were pretty close on either side so I said “Excuse me” to try to pass and she jumped and yelped kinda I guess surprised. She apologized and I felt extremely embarrassed and kinda shuffled by and went around the corner to keep looking.

But after looking for about 5 minutes she came around the corner looking as well and kinda stood next to me staring at the shelf for like 5 minutes as I grabbed things off the shelf, looked, and put it back. After about 5 minutes of this I picked one up and she went “That one is really good.. its getting an anime soon I am pretty sure.” I was kinda taken a back because this was the first time in like 2-3 years a person in public has randomly spoken to me and not been like an older person. I kinda just said “Hmm” and set it back down and didn’t say much else. She also sat there silently but then eventually said “Whats that book about?” Referring to the one I was holding. Now if you know anything about the series, there is 0 chance to explain it without coming across like a complete loser (I am one I just don’t like being one in public) at least that I can think of.. so I just said “Its a huge series, its about one of the side characters kinda a deeper look into his story and perspective.” She listened and then asked me a few more questions about the series, neither of is looking away from the shelf. She seemed really interested and started looking up at me while I explained it. Eventually she grabbed a manga off the shelf and said “You might like this one I think, you should text me and tell me if you like it.” She offered her hand for my phone and I handed it to her and she put her number in as a contact. She then asked me if I lived near here, if I came here a lot, then she told me all about this Anime movie she wanted to watch for a while called Howls Moving Castle, apparently its an older style Anime movie. She asked me if I would wanna come to her apartment and watch it sometime. I said sure.

Eventually I went to go read my book in the cafe. I kept thinking about our chat and at first thought she was flirting with me, but eventually I kinda convinced myself she was probably just trying to make friends, cause I think assuming everytime a woman is friendly that shes into you is kinda weird. So I just kinda moved on. Today, I saw my sister for her birthday and told her about it and she flipped out at me saying “That girl worked up the balls to approach you and you barely even noticed.” So now I am extremely confused. Idk if she was just making friends, or if she was hitting on me… i don’t wanna assume but I have legitimately never been approached by a girl in public, only ever at school or a social setting.

Am I right in thinking my sister is biased or being nice? That this girl was probably just trying to make friends or chat with someone? I haven’t texted her yet and honestly don’t really know what to say. 

TLDR: A girl struck up a conversation at a bookstore with me and gave me her number. My sister thinks I was hit on, I think it was just someone being friendly.",1,1747688842.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I was walking alone around the mall with my brown baseball cap on, so you couldn’t really see my face. I didn’t think I looked especially cute or anything—just normal, kind of blending in. 

I was heading to grab a quick coffee. It was the middle of the day, so the mall was a little empty. I wasn’t really paying attention, just looking down as I walked. Then, out of the corner of my eye, this random guy approaches me and says, “Excuse me, I noticed you from afar and just wanted to let you know that you’re beautiful.”

It completely caught me off guard. I literally had to ask, “What?” because I wasn’t sure I heard him right. He repeated himself, and I was kind of stunned. I said, “Oh, thank you!”—but I’m pretty sure my face said WTF is happening because, for a second, my mind jumped to ‘am I getting trafficked?’ (which is crazy, considering I was in the middle of a public mall).

He asked for my name and shook my hand. Then he asked what I was up to, and I told him I was just getting coffee. He smiled and said, “Okay, well enjoy the coffee,” and walked off.

It was totally random, but… oddly sweet? He didn’t ask for my number or anything—just gave me a compliment and left. It’s actually the second time something like this has happened—some guy comes up, asks my name, shakes my hand, and then just walks away.

Do guys usually do this? This is my first time experiencing these types of approaches…. It happened pretty quick like maybe 1 minute… maybe he saw me up close and was like “nah.” 😭 idk… ",79,1747688586.0,CasualConversation,39,0.99,False

I currently work in the CRE Sector, specifically at a startup boutique REPE Firm (the company is only three years old). 

I made it through multiple rounds of interviews. I also didn’t come from investment banking; I come from a retail sales background (some days imposter syndrome creeps up, I'm still surprised I got the offer), but I majored in real estate finance in college and studied in my free time CRE. My current issue is that I’m wondering if I should have taken the CRE Brokerage offer (The brokerage was a well-known boutique in my area.) over the REPE start-up offer. My MD is very pleased with my underwriting and work ethic and has no complaints about me. The main issue currently for me with being in a start-up is that the base salary is low compared to the average base salary of some other firms. However, I get a slice of the carry and acquisition fee (which is very rare). I also understand brokerage is typically all commission, and sometimes a draw is offered. I always wanted to be on the buy side but didn't realize it would be my first job after college.  

Realistically, I guess you can’t realistically compare a 3-year-old company to a 10-year-old. Even though the market is a little dicey right now, and deal flow isn’t insufficient, it’s not flowing like Niagara Falls, either. In the back of my mind, if I stick it out, I may one day make partner or high-level in the firm if I stay. 

My question is, did I make the right choice by joining the start-up? Should I have gone brokerage, or am I just overthinking things and needing to ride this out and see where it goes? I’m only 23, and I'm
not a nepo baby. I had to network and do hella coffee chats to get to this position. My family has no connection to the investment world at all.

CHAPTER TWO

When Keira woke the next day, a feeling of mortification struck her. Memories of the party came flooding back, of the tequila shots with her friends and the whole unpleasant experience with Rob kissing her, and her throwing a drink in his face. But that wasn’t the worst thing. The worst thing that had happened was that she’d texted Cristiano.

She heaved back the covers, getting tangled in them in her haste to find her cell phone and falling flat on her ass. From the hard floor, she groaned and reached up to the coffee table, getting hold of it.

Once the phone was in her hands, Keira became too terrified to look. She hesitated, her thumb hovering over the button, before finally swallowing her anguish and pressing down.

Immediately, she saw she’d received several text notifications. Her heart leapt into her throat. Could one be from Cristiano? She clicked on the icon.

The first was Maxine asking if she was okay. The next; Maxine, again, asking her to let her know she got home okay. Then several from Shelby writing a stream of unconnected words spelled incorrectly, another from Maxine from earlier this morning stating that if Keira didn’t get in touch by midday she’d call the police, and finally one from her mom asking if she’d ever tried coconut milk in her latte. But nothing from Cristiano.

Her stomach sank. Disappointment settled deeply in her chest. But it was quickly replaced by a new sensation: relief. She’d taken the first step, broken the wall of silence between them, and Cristiano had chosen not to communicate in return. At least now she knew where she stood. She didn’t need to wonder anymore. As difficult as it was to know things were truly over, she was glad at least for some certainty.

She looked back at Maxine’s messages, no longer distracted by thoughts of Cristiano and able to pay them the attention they deserved.

Are you okay, hon? So sorry about Rob! What a jerk. I know you well enough to know you’re probably embarrassed about it, but you’re literally my hero right now.

She smiled to herself, her mortification of having made a spectacle of herself dissipating slightly. She typed a response.

Sorry for being silent. I must’ve fallen asleep as soon as I got home. Of course I’m embarrassed, but at least you’re proud of me.

She sent the message and went to put her phone away, then on second thought sent a text to her mom, Mallory.

Yes. And it’s yummy.

She heard the sound of a key in the door then and jumped with surprise. As she turned to look over her shoulder, she saw Bryn enter the apartment, dressed in workout gear, her cheeks pink, hairline sweaty, and face grinning widely. Keira realized then that she was not alone. Felix was in tow. For an older gentleman he certainly looked all right in workout gear. He reminded her a little of the before model from an ad for male hair dye.

“You’re up,” Bryn said to Keira with a smile. “How was the party?”

“Could’ve been better,” Keira murmured in reply. “Where have you two been?”

Bryn went over to the sink to fill up her empty water bottle. It was Felix who answered Keira’s question.

“We just went for a jog,” he said.

Keira had to stop herself from exclaiming, “At your age?” Instead, she managed to censor herself and instead asked, “At this time of the morning?”

“Best time for it,” Felix replied. He raised one of his legs, resting it on a kitchen stool and stretching to touch his toes.

He was fitter than Keira, that much was evident. She’d let everything deteriorate in that department and her waistline was starting to suffer for it. It was all well and good eating and drinking to her heart’s content when she was hiking up Italian mountainsides, but now that her evenings consisted of binge-watching TV and eating pretzels, it wasn’t so great. She poked her stomach. It was definitely squishier than it used to be. She’d have to do something about that soon.

Bryn turned back from the sink and took a long swig from her bottle. “Have you heard from Mom?”

“Just some random text about coconut milk latte,” Keira replied.

Bryn laughed. “She’s losing her mind. She was supposed to let you know about dinner tonight.”

“Oh,” Keira replied.

“Well?” Bryn probed. “What do you say? Swanson ladies dinner date?”

“Isn’t Felix invited?” Keira asked, curiously. Mallory seemed to love Felix; either that or she was just very relieved that Bryn had finally started a stable relationship.

Felix switched to stretching his other leg. He glanced at Keira, his hands outstretched clasping the toe of his sneaker. “I’ve got plans with my own family tonight. It’s my parents’ wedding anniversary.”

Once again, Keira had to bite her tongue to stop from blurting out something rude. But she really was surprised that Felix’s parents were alive and kicking. They must be well into their eighties, the age Keira’s grandparents would have been had either still been alive.

“That’s lovely,” she managed to say.

“What shall I tell Mom?” Bryn asked.

“Tell her okay,” Keira replied.

Maybe some mollycoddling could help kick-start her out of her funk. There really was nothing like Mallory’s maternal cloying to remind Keira how important her independence was.

Bryn and Felix exchanged a nod and then headed for the door.

“Where are you going?” Keira asked.

“Second five K,” Bryn replied.

“Ten before breakfast has always been my motto,” Felix added.

They waved and swirled out the door. Keira blinked at it. It was hard to believe that

anyone

could be that physically active, let alone a sixty-something man. She wondered how long it took someone to train to run 10k and realized it wouldn’t take that long at all. Certainly less than a year. Felix could have started his fitness regime on his sixtieth birthday for all she knew. It was never too late to make a change.

She realized, suddenly, that she needed to stop sitting around feeling sorry for herself. Overcome by a surge of motivation, Keira grasped her work bag and pulled out her notebook. She quickly wrote a list of all the things she needed to change in her life, including losing a couple of extra pounds and getting her roots touched up. She scanned the list and realized there was one very important change she needed to make to get her life back on track, and that was getting herself into her own apartment. The longer she stayed sleeping on Bryn’s couch, the harder it was becoming to ever imagine herself being independent, standing on her own two feet again.

She fetched her laptop and went onto a real estate website. She hadn’t checked apartment prices for at least a couple of years, having been settled with Zach for so long, and the prices made her eyes water. But if she added up her work bonuses and the several grand she’d saved just from not having to pay rent or for any of her food for the last few months, she might just be able to scrape together enough to put down a deposit. On paper she looked like a safe bet, since she had a steady job with a decent income. She started to feel the first glimmer of hope in days.

She scrolled through all the apartments, looking for one to rent within her price range. Most of them looked a little worse for wear, but she liked DIY and didn’t mind having a fixer-upper. She just wanted something that was her own, somewhere she could call home after spending weeks on end in hotel rooms.

At last, an apartment caught her eye. A one-bed, one-bath condo farther west from Manhattan than she usually went. From the photos it looked like it had been a sad divorcé’s downsizer, but Keira could see past the drab, unloved decor. The windows were huge, the ceilings high. Without the graying carpet it would look even more spacious. The building had laundry facilities in the basement, and it was less than a mile from a subway station.

It felt like fate.

Keira grabbed her phone and punched in the agent’s number. After a few rings, a croaky voice answered, an older woman with a decades-developed smoker’s rasp.

“I’m inquiring about the apartment on your website,” she said, explaining which specific one she was interested in.

“Oh yeah, that one’s a beaut,” the woman replied. “Great location. How tall are you?”

Keira was taken aback by the question. “Why?”

“’Cause the last two guys I showed it to were the size of basketball players and wanted more space. Waste of everyone’s time. And time is money, kiddo. So? How tall?”

“Five two,” Keira said.

“Perfect,” the woman rasped. “When d’ya wanna look?”

Keira thought of her job, of the long hours she often had to work at

Viatorum.

“A weekend would be better.”

“Whatcha doin’ today?” came the woman’s response. “I had a cancellation so could fit you in.”

“Today?” Keira repeated, surprised. It wasn’t like she had anything else to do. “Okay, yes. Today is fine!”

They made the necessary arrangements and Keira hung up the call, feeling a little dazed from the speed with which it had all happened. It really did feel like fate.



Keira left the subway, finding herself in an unfamiliar but rather pleasant part of New York. It was one of the things about the city she loved so much, how it changed, evolved, and developed so constantly it was always reinventing itself. Not that long ago this area must have been a bit rundown and the public hadn’t yet caught on, because there was no way she’d be able to afford to rent a place here otherwise!

She hurried along the sidewalk, scanning the door numbers as she went, searching for the correct building. As she drew closer to the correct number, she noticed a woman standing ahead in a fuchsia pink two-piece and matching heels, smoking a cigarette. That must be the real estate agent she spoke to on the phone.

The woman turned, presumably at the sound of Keira’s footsteps, and threw her cigarette to the ground. She put it out with the toe of her shoe and headed toward the door, gesturing for Keira to follow her, blowing smoke from the side of her lips as she went.

“Let’s get inside,” she called out when Keira was still a few paces away. “I’m freezing my butt off out here.”

Keira blinked in surprise at how rapidly things continued to move. Without even introductions, she followed the woman inside the apartment building.

Inside, it was as dingy as Keira had expected, but the staircase was in one piece and the elevator smelled fine. They went up to the thirteenth floor and Keira was pleased to see there was no graffiti anywhere in the corridor they emerged into.

The real estate agent put a key in the lock of a plain white door and then pushed it open.

The smell of dust wafted out. It smelled like the condo hadn’t been vacuumed for years. They stepped inside.

“The landlord lived here for a bit before moving to another place and renting this out. He’s a bachelor,” the agent said, wiping her fingers across the balustrade and picking up dust. “You can probably tell.”

But Keira didn’t care about the layer of dust. She didn’t even care about how much smaller the apartment was in real life compared to the pictures, or how the wallpaper was covered in smudgy handprints. She could see past all of that. The condo to her meant freedom, independence, the beginning of her life. A reboot. An anchor.

“I love it!” she cried, clapping her hands.

The agent didn’t seem moved by her gushing. “Good,” she said simply. “Bedroom’s through there. That’s the reason it’s cheap. Not enough room for a proper double, just one of those European-sized ones. But you’re short so you’ll fit fine.”

Keira peered into the bedroom. It was indeed little more than a closet. But what else did she need from a bedroom than a place to sleep? It wasn’t like she had a partner to share her bed with, it would just be her. Her and maybe a cat…

“Looks big enough for me,” she said. “I don’t actually own a bed so it will just be a case of getting something that fits.”

The real estate agent nodded in her characteristic lackluster way. “Great. Wanna rent it?”

Keira needed a moment to think. This was happening too fast. She ducked back out of the bedroom into the living area and walked over to the large windows, looking out at the view. She could see Central Park from here.

Suddenly she could imagine herself sitting by this window, gazing out at the streets, drinking coffee, writing. It was like her own Paris hotel window. Perfect for her. She didn’t need anything fancy, not when she was abroad for work so often. She just needed somewhere to call her own. A fresh start.

She swirled to face the fuchsia-clad real estate agent. “Yes. I’ll take it.”

# Chapter 2

CHAPTER THREE

Mallory leaned across the table and filled Keira’s now empty glass with more rosé. Keira grimaced. She didn’t care for the sickly sweet pink wine her mother favored, but there wasn’t much she could do about it. When it came to Mallory Swanson, refusal was futile.

Bryn caught Keira’s eye from across the table and smirked. She hated the pink wine just as much as Keira did. At least it provided them with a private joke they could share.

“So Keira,” Mallory said, addressing her youngest daughter.

Keira broke her gaze from Bryn to regard Mallory. She could tell by the way her mother’s eyes were slightly narrowed, and the way her wine glass was askew in her hands, that she was slightly tipsy. Which meant that she was about to ask something very personal, as was her way when she’d had a glass or two.

Keira braced herself. “Yes, Mother?”

“Have you heard from Cristiano?”

There it was. The gut punch.

Before Keira had a chance to even groan, Mallory flinched and flashed angry eyes at Bryn.

“Don’t kick me, young lady!” she exclaimed. “If I don’t ask she doesn’t tell. How else am I supposed to know what’s going on in my daughter’s life? One minute he was Mr. Right and then he was Mr. Gone. I want to know what happened.”

Petulance was another one of Mallory’s tipsy habits.

Keira sighed. “It’s okay. It’s about time I talked about what happened.” She put her wine glass down. At least if she was the one commanding the conversation she’d have an excuse not to drink any more rosé. “I haven’t heard from him since I broke it off. I really thought we’d be friends. It felt like a mature separation, you know? Like we could both tell it wasn’t right. But then he disappeared off the face of the earth. No communication whatsoever. I mean, am I an idiot for ever thinking you can be friends with an ex? The same thing happened with Shane.”

“Oh, darling, I’m not the one to ask,” Mallory replied. “You know too well how disastrous my love life has been.”

If Keira had a bingo card for things her mom discussed when she was drinking, she’d probably have ticked all the boxes by now. Career. Tick. Painful broken heart. Tick. And now, the real kicker: Dad.

Keira knew the story all too well, but that didn’t stop Mallory from bringing it up constantly. He was her one true love, they were young but thought it would work, he couldn’t handle the responsibility of children, he’d left her destitute in a big city with two young kids. Though she’d never met her dad, Keira was absolutely certain his absence played a role in her own inability to sustain a happy relationship. And he was

definitely

the reason Bryn was setting up house with an old man.

Mallory waved her glass in front of her face, sloshing some pink liquid onto the table in front of her. “I will say this though. Broken hearts, like broken bones, are stronger once they’re repaired.”

Keira quirked an eyebrow. That was actually quite insightful coming from Mallory.

“Who are you quoting that from, Mom?” Bryn piped up. “Oprah Winfrey?”

“I don’t remember who,” Mallory snapped. “It might have been in a fortune cookie. It doesn’t matter. The point is, you will get over this and you will learn something and you will heal and your heart will go on.”

“Ooh, I know that one. That one’s Celine Dion,” Bryn said.

Mallory frowned at her. “Will you stop with your jokes, Bryn! I’m trying to make Keira feel better.”

“You are, Mom,” Keira said meaningfully, speaking for the first time in ages. “You’re actually helping a ton. Bryn is too, in her own way.” She smiled at her sister. Bryn had put up with a lot from Keira over the last few weeks, from her moping around all day in unwashed clothes to her short temper. Now felt like a good time to let them know about what had happened with the real estate agent earlier that day. “Actually, I have a bit of news. Good news.”

“Oh?” they both asked in unison.

Keira felt suddenly shy. Renting a condo was such a big step for her, for all of them really. It would mark her transition, finally, from young adult to woman. For Mallory, it would be the end of her constant worry about her youngest getting along in the world. For Bryn, it would mean the return of her own independence, the lessening of responsibility, the lightening of the burden she’d always had to carry as the older of the two sisters.

“I’ve put a deposit down to rent my own apartment.”

There was a moment of stunned silence. Then Bryn began to whoop. Mallory broke into a wide grin.

“Darling, have you really?” she asked.

Keira smiled shyly and nodded. “Yup.”

Bryn was out of her seat suddenly. She came up around Keira and threw her arms about. “Oh THANK GOD!” she cried.

Keira laughed in her tight embrace. “Okay, okay, I know I’ve been a pain, but really!”

Bryn released her grip a little. “It’s not that you’ve been a pain,” she said. “It’s just that Felix… well, he asked me to get a place with him. I’ve been dragging my feet…”

“I knew it!” Keira exclaimed.

From the other side of the table, Mallory began to cry. “My two girls, growing up so fast.”

Of course, the last box on the bingo board could now be ticked. Cry!



Keira headed out into the cold evening, pulling her coat about her. The dinner with her mom and Bryn had been rejuvenating. She’d enjoyed it far more than she’d expected.

Bryn had headed off to Felix’s for the night, so Keira would have the apartment to herself. She was tired, though, and felt like going straight to bed. She’d be back in the office tomorrow and wanted to be fresh for it. She’d been a grump for the last few weeks. Hopefully her positive attitude would carry over until tomorrow.

The subway sign appeared up ahead. As she headed toward it, Keira felt a vibration in her pocket. Her cell phone. She reached inside and took it out.

To her surprise, this time it was a text from Cristiano. Her heart seemed to stop beating as she opened it up.

Whoever this is, leave Cristiano alone. He’s moved on.

Keira stared at the message, blinking in shock. It wasn’t from Cristiano at all, but from someone using his phone. A new girlfriend?

Her stomach sank. All the good work that had been done that evening seemed to suddenly unravel and spool inside of her. How could he have moved on so quickly? After all those conversations they’d had about him only wanting to date women he could imagine marrying. How many were there for him to have found a new one in such a short space of time! Being marriage material in Cristiano’s eyes clearly didn’t mean that much after all. Had Keira been duped?

She thrust her phone back into her purse. Fuming, she hurried down the subway steps and on to the waiting train. She slumped into a seat and gazed at the blackness out the window.

Her mind raced a mile a minute, picking apart all the times they’d spent together, searching for new meaning, new clues in the moments they were together.

But the more she thought, the more her anger lessened. Instead of holding on to the worst possible scenario her mind could conjure—that Cristiano had lied to her about being careful with his heart—she managed to talk herself down to a place of reason. Sometimes the rebound relationship was the best relationship. He’d been her rebound from Shane and the time they’d spent together had been wonderful. Perhaps this new woman was just his rebound rather than his next wife. Perhaps he’d learned that from Keira, that sometimes it was okay to be with a person just because you wanted to, rather than always having some grand plan in place.

She remembered Mallory’s words, about each relationship being an opportunity to learn and grow, to move onward and upward. Cristiano might indeed be going through the same thing. And Keira could feel, tangibly, that she was as well. Rather than holding on to her fury, to her bruised ego, it had only taken her the subway ride to start to let it go.

She got off the train and headed back up to street level, exiting the subway a wiser woman than she’d been when she entered. When she’d gotten on the train she was upset but as she left, she was relieved. This was the real line in the sand with her Cristiano. This was the real ending. It was time to move on, once and for all.",1,1747688471.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Can't have even a tiny sip of coffee with cows milk in before running for my antihistamines and throwing up. 

However, I can have real butter or straight up milk in baked goods like croissants, cakes and biscuits and as long as it is baked I seem to have basically no reaction. Does not apply for chocolate in baked goods though (sad). But I get a reaction from cross contamination in milk steaming from coffee shops. Anything that happens during baking that just gets rid of those milk proteins?

Podcast.,"I remember when I was a Junkie I heard a case in 2010s about a falsely imprisoned African American. Supposedly the only person who saw him was an old woman looking out through her window. After he sent letters of appeal to various organizations one of them finally sent out a reporter to speak with this woman and it made it onto the local news. The old woman finally admitted she saw a dark figure ie it must be an African American? But later she admitted it was too dark to see the color of his skin let alone a face. Since this was the only evidence they had the court systems have fought to keep him in Jail as releasing him would open them to lawsuits and worst of all ""admitting they were wrong"" I'm pretty sure this happened around Michigan, Indiana, Ohio area. The Caster stated something like 50 or 60 years have passed and the man is still in jail. Perhaps dead by now? 

I know his wife and kids eventually abandoned him. I believe it started that his son has occasionally visited but his wife remarried and still wants nothing to do with him. 

Anyone know the man's name? I happened to mention the case during coffee with friends but I couldn't remember any names so they called BS. But I know this still happens I'm society. ",3,1747688036.0,TrueCrimePodcasts,3,0.72,False

Copywriting Tactics that will generate leads for your business:

I have been using these methods to generate leads for my clients. Now, I would like to share with you all. So that you all entrepreneurs can see more growth.



1 . Compare Yourself to Others

People want to know why they should choose you.

Show how you are better than others. You can talk about how you're faster, cheaper, or offer better quality.

Example:

A. “If you are a local soft drink producer [milk shake etc] compare it with giants like Pepsi, Coke. It may sound funny but it works better than anything.”  
Or  
B. “We deliver in 1 day. Others take 5 days.”

Remember: Don’t say bad things about others. Just explain what you do better.



2. Make Your Price Feel Smaller

Prices can sound big unless you compare them to something small.

Example: Instead of saying “$9 per month,” say “Less than 3 cups of coffee a month.”

You can also explain what they get for that price: “For under $10, you get support every day and peace of mind.”

Remember: Try different ways of saying the price to see what works best.

I personally sometimes use: less than your monthly C!grate costs or Less than your monthly coffee cost etc. Something new, catchy but very personal.



3. Use Visuals and Simple Layouts

Too much text is hard to read.

Use bold words, bullet points, or images to make your message clear and easy to understand.

Break long text into smaller parts so people can read fast.

Remember: Use the same colors and fonts so everything looks nice and clean.



4. Learn From the Bad Reviews of your competitors

Look at 1–3 star reviews of your competitors.

See what people don’t like—like slow support or missing features.Highlight those points as your USPs

Pro Tip:

1. Always use buyer intent data.
2. Choose Clickbait titles [it may sound unethical but no harm until it is helping your customers]
3. Do not cheat or play any kind of tricks/fake promises through your blogs [be 100% honest and transparent]

I hope this will help you.

Thank you and good luck.",1,1747688006.0,EntrepreneurRideAlong,0,1.0,False
1kqmvfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kqmvfo/why_choose_marriotto_mr9n_water_filter_review_for/,Why Choose MARRIOTTO MR9-N Water Filter Review for Cleaner Refrigerator Water?,"The **MARRIOTTO MR9-N Water Filter** has been a daily companion in my kitchen for over a month now, and I’ve tested it extensively to see if it lives up to its promises. With a reputation for improving water quality and fitting seamlessly into specific models of GE refrigerators, this filter piqued my interest as a solution to my ongoing battle with unpleasant tap water. However, as with any product, there are both good and bad aspects, so let’s dive in and dissect this filter’s performance.

**Design and Ease of Installation**

The design of this replacement water filter is both sleek and straightforward. Its compact size of 1"" x 1"" x 1” is impressively convenient for a component that plays such a critical role in water purification. When replacing the old filter, I was pleasantly surprised by how hassle-free the installation process was. The idea of a tool-free set-up sounded too good to be true, but sliding this filter into place took less than a minute. The leak-proof fit it offers is notable, as I’ve experienced messy installation debacles with other filters in the past. For someone who isn’t particularly handy, I found this to be very user-friendly.

[Find the best price for MARRIOTTO MR9-N on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0dlfw6q4t/)

**Water Quality and Taste Improvement**

Water taste is a critical factor for me, especially as I drink copious amounts of water every day. The NSF/ANSI Standard 42 certification of this filter is a significant selling point, and it does deliver on the promise of reducing 97.9% of chlorine, bad odors, and unpleasant tastes. After switching to this filter, I noticed an immediate improvement in the flavor and smell of my water. My coffee and tea tasted fresher, while the unpleasant chemical undertones in the tap water completely vanished. Having this filter in place makes me feel better about the safety and quality of the water I give to my kids, too.

**Compatibility and Fit**

One key strength is its compatibility with various GE refrigerator models, such as the GFE24, GNE27, and GSS25. I personally own a GE GNE21 model, and the filter snapped into place effortlessly. It’s worth noting, however, that this filter is specifically designed for GE refrigerators, so if your fridge belongs to a different brand, this might not be the right choice. This makes checking compatibility before purchasing absolutely essential.

**Filter Longevity and Performance**

The manufacturer recommends replacing the filter every 6 months or 200 gallons, whichever comes first. In my household, with three active water drinkers, we average about 6 months before needing a replacement. Given its effectiveness, the lifespan feels appropriate, though it’s less ideal for larger families who might go through 200 gallons much quicker. I do wish the longevity matched some higher-capacity filters on the market, but the trade-off here is the superior taste quality.

**Highlights**

- Certified to reduce 97.9% of chlorine, unpleasant odors, and bad tastes, greatly enhancing water quality.
- Easy installation with a leak-proof design—perfect for people who dread complicated replacements.
- Seamless compatibility with multiple GE refrigerator models.
- Compact size doesn’t compromise on filtration power.

**Areas for Improvement**

- The six-month or 200-gallon lifespan might not be lengthy enough for high-usage households.
- Limited compatibility with only specific models of GE refrigerators.

**Rival Brands**

In comparison to similar products like the GE XWFE factory model, the MARRIOTTO MR9-N stands out as a more affordable yet equally efficient alternative. While the official GE filter enjoys the reliability of coming directly from the brand, this replacement filter provides comparable taste and chlorine elimination without the higher price point. On the other hand, some competing brands like Waterdrop offer longer lifespans, but their installation tends to be elusive for non-standard fridge models. Here, the filter’s compatibility and ease of use keep it ahead of most rivals.

**Value Assessment**

Balancing cost and performance, I’d categorize this filter as a smart investment for anyone with a compatible refrigerator model. While it might not offer some of the extras found in pricier filters, the job it does for enhancing water quality and the sheer ease of use make it worth every penny. For those not looking to break the bank but keen on health and taste improvements, this filter strikes a great middle ground.

1kqmsac,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1kqmsac/am_i_cooked_ma_in_english_work_experience_in/,"Am I cooked? MA in English, work experience in franchise operations (but I want out).","Hi all,

**CONTEXT:**

I (26M) live in the great state of Louisiana, graduated from a small potatoes university in 2023 with a Master of Arts in English (concentration in publishing studies, 4.0 GPA), and my first job out of college is with the corporate office of the coffee chain I worked at while attending said college as a franchise consultant.  
  
I went to school for English because I wanted to write books. When I graduated with my BA, I realized that was unrealistic so I decided I wanted to *edit* books and got my MA in English with a concentration in publishing. All the while, I was working in a variety of coffee shops and restaurants to pay the bills. While getting my master's, I also worked a research position at the university press as an editorial assistant and acquisitional reader.

Shortly after graduating, the job search was rather abysmal, considering that Louisiana (then and especially now) doesn't place a high-value on editorial work. My coworker managed to land a gig with the corporate side of the coffee shop we worked at, and I kind of tagged along, using them as a reference.

**CURRENT ROLE:**

My role is as a franchise consultant. I advise franchisees on how to run their stores, assist with day-to-day issues, and travel often to audit stores based on brand compliance / provide new store training.

At first, I really enjoyed my job and felt like it was a prime intersection of what I'm good at and what I'm interested in. After a year and a half, the cupcake phase has very much worn off, and I feel over-worked, underpaid, and rarely appreciated (for reference, @$45k/year, I make less than what a first-year teacher makes in my state's parish, despite having a comparable work-load, and again, I have a master's degree). 

Franchisees are often extremely difficult to work with and highly emotional. My role takes the brunt of that and upper management seems to be more focused on big picture, while we're struggling with ground-level implementation. There is an extreme lack of structure and boundaries. I often end up working on weekends and holidays due to the nature of the business. I am mentally and emotionally exhausted.

There also seems to be very little opportunity for growth, and they seem to be devising more and more ways to pay us less after laying off large portions of team and forcing us to absorb additional responsibilities (with no increase in pay). Morale is also pretty grim, and I don't know whether the experience I've gained in the past year and a half of working there will serve me well in trying to find work elsewhere.

**JOB SEARCH WHILE EMPLOYED:**

I've been applying to editor positions on LinkedIn in my downtime, but most of the time I just get a rejection email a few months after applying. I've also applied to my local school district to teach high school (something I never envisioned myself doing).

**QUESTION:**

So, I guess I just want to know, do I have any viability within the modern job market? What jobs could I be applying for that would make good use of my skillset?

I don't think I want to travel for work forever, especially if I were to ever start a family and settle down. I'm not the most business-minded person and I hate talking financials. I'm very detail-oriented and an effective problem-solver in matters of logic and reasoning.

1kqms8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kirby/comments/1kqms8a/the_plot_of_kirby_the_rise_of_the_mayhem/,"The plot of ""Kirby: The Rise of the Mayhem Adventures"" is now finished!","Here is the full plot:

The film starts with the flashbacks of past episodes of *""Kirby: Right Back at Ya!""* as the narrator begins speaking, from episodes 1 to 100, where it ended with the final battle of Kirby's Star Rod and Lord Nightmare, which he defeated due to its only weakness, and moving onto the final scene of ""Fright to The Finish"". 25 years later, Kirby (Makiko Ohmoto) is in his house, sleeping on his bed. A TV remote that fell off of Kirby's hand, suddenly hit the power button, turning on the TV, which shows a news broadcasting network called ""DreamLand News"" of a news report about the new building of a new company called Popstar Dream Industries, with a female cappy newscaster named Tara (Aria Noelle Curzon) talking about the origins of the company after Nightmare Enterprises' fall and demise of Lord Nightmare. Meanwhile, a female cappy news reporter named Laura (Anndi McAfee) is seen outside doing a live report about this, and interviewed Chief Bookem (Billy West), who then talks about the new building, which he then describes about everyone being excited about it, which also stating that it would be better than Nightmare Enterprises and the Noid, the former mascot of Domino's Pizza. After the news report, Kirby then gets excited about the new building as he turns off the TV and runs off to Cappy Town.

Kirby sees Tiff (Ashley Johnson), Tuff (Michaela Dietz), Fololo (Wendie Malick), and Falala (Andrea Libman), and they all hug together. Tiff, Tuff, Fololo, and Falala talked to him about the new building that the news report Kirby watched is talking about, which is about the company Popstar Dream Industries, and Tuff stated that everyone is excited about it, including Kirby. After they left Kirby, who waved goodbye to them, Kirby runs off to Kawasaki's restaurant, where Chef Kawasaki (Zach Galifianakis) works at, and he enjoys a delicious breakfast which consisted of two scrambled eggs and a hashbrown off of a menu that he's holding on, which Kawasaki finally made at the right time. The montage continues with Kirby delivering a box of donuts to Chief Bookem and his wife, Buttercup (Dakota Fanning), waving hello to Mabel (Megan Mullally), Mayor Len Blustergas (Seth Macfarlane) and Professor Curio (Maurice LaMarche), and meeting up with Bandana Waddle Dee (Kath Soucie) as they both fly a kite together. As the day passes by, Kirby goes out fishing, which is followed by him along with Bandana Waddle Dee, Tiff, Tuff, Fololo, and Falala cheering together at a ballpark, Kirby and Bandana Waddle Dee watching a movie together at a movie theater, he along with Tiff and Tuff watching the clouds, and Kirby enjoying dinner with Hana (Maria Bamford).

As nighttime falls, Kirby is exhausted from doing so many things, and as he was about to enter his house, he suddenly saw Tokkori (Grace Rolek), who apologized to him and admitted his wrongdoings, which he then also stated that this is the last time that he gets to see him and is moving back into his old home. After Kirby and Tokkori hugged together, he flew off into the sky, and Kirby waved goodbye, shedding a tear from his eye that he wiped before entering his house quietly. Later at Castle Dedede, King Dedede (Dana Snyder) is depressed about the fall of Nightmare Enterprises, which is worse than a fight that he had with Peter Griffin, but not to mention, he also stated that the N.M.E Sales Guy was retired after the fall and demise of said company. Escargoon feels bad for him but tells him that they need to think about something that isn't evil or dark, like Skeletor's evil plans. King Dedede gets an idea and tells Escargoon about starting his own business in his castle, similar to what Mr. Krabs did when he first opened his own Krusty Krab restaurant, but suddenly realizes that he admitted his wrongdoings towards Kirby and had to give an apology note to him, even though he had a Popeye and Brutus relationship with him ever since the day they first met. After they suddenly noticed that the new building that everyone is excited about, they both went to bed and will have to discuss the new business that King Dedede is planning for tomorrow morning.

Meanwhile, back at Kirby's house, Kirby was awoken by the sound of a door knock, which he then answered it and turned out to be his friend, Elfilin (Lukita Maxwell), who was happy to see him in his home, ever since they first met in the new world from the Forgotten Land. Kirby then lets Elfilin just to have a chat with him, and as Kirby grabbed out a tube of strawberry flavored ice cream from his refrigerator, Elfilin also told Kirby about Tokkori, saying that he will be going back to his old home in the woods, but lightens up by telling him that he will be staying with him. Assuming that it is getting late, after the conversation, both Kirby and Elfilin fell asleep on his bed. Earlier in the morning, in the forest where Whispy Woods (Carlos Alazraqui) lives, Coo (Thomas Ian Nicholas) wakes up from his nest and sees Tokkori in his old nest. Rick (John DiMaggio) also wakes up from his net that he is sleeping on. Rick gets ready for the day with breakfast as he plays music on his speaker, while the conversation starts with Tokkori and Coo. After Rick finished his breakfast and brushed his teeth, he suddenly spotted the finished building for DreamLand Pop Industries and wanted to see the grand opening. Accepting the request, Tokkori would rather stay home, since he's an introvert, but wished them good luck.

Meanwhile, when it's 6 AM at Kirby's house, Kirby slowly wakes up from his sleep, takes off his sleeping cap, yawns, and stretches. He quietly starts singing and humming to the Cheers theme song (""Where Everybody Knows Your Name"") as he starts getting ready for the new day, such as washing his face with water and brushing his teeth (like he does in ""A Dental Dilemma"") in the bathroom, even licking the toothpaste off his cheek. Elfilin wakes up to see Kirby fully awake and getting ready for the big day, as Kirby enjoys his breakfast, which consists of a toast covered in grape jelly and a glass of orange juice. After his breakfast, Kirby licked the breadcrumbs off his lips and drank his orange juice as Elfilin told him that today is the grand opening of the new building of the DreamLand Pop Industries, making Kirby excited about it. Together, Kirby and Elfilin went to the grand opening before the news bulletin started, as broadcasted live by DreamLand News. Later, during the coffee break in the morning at Castle Dedede, King Dedede and Escargoon heard everything about the grand opening, which caught their attention. At the grand opening, Mayor Len Blustergas announces that the Waddle Dees will run the new company and building right next to Castle Dedede, since Kirby made everything better after destroying Nightmare Enterprises, this causes Kirby to burst into joy and excitement. After cutting the red ribbon, Bandana Waddle Dee plays ""The Best"" by Tina Turner on his boombox, starting the celebration with confetti bursting.

In the afternoon, at Castle Dedede, King Dedede and Escargoon reencounter everything that they have saw throughout the news livestream of the grand opening of the new building of the Popstar Dream Industires, which Captain Waddle Doo (Kate Micucci) overhears everything that happened, making him excited about it. Back in the forest, Rick and Coo explain everything to Whispy Woods and Tokkori, who think that they have a good time. Later, back in Cappy Town, Kirby introduces Elfilin to Tiff, Tuff, Fololo, Falala, Honey (Kath Soucie), Iro, and Spikehead (Cody Arens), who also introduce themselves to Elfilin, as Bandana Waddle Dee already knew about Elfilin, ever since Kirby rescued Elfilin from the Beast Pack and saved the best of both worlds from collision. After the conversation, Kirby's stomach begins grumbling, meaning that Kirby is famished. Together, Kirby and his friends went to have lunch at Kawasaki's restaurant, where Kirby faces a group of men, one of them is named Joseph (Danny DeVito), Benny (Robert Wu), and Eric (Eric Bauza), and they challenge Kirby to see who can eat the most. Accepting the challenge, Kirby begins by inhaling the men's meals and eating them, which also starts the challenge when Kawasaki brings more meals to the men's table and Kirby's table, as ""The Heat is On"" by Glenn Frey starts playing. After the challenge and as the song ends, the three men, Joseph, Benny, and Eric, get more obese at their table, and Kirby delightfully licks his lips and rubs his tummy. As a result, Kawasaki kicked the three men out of his restaurant and said that Kirby won the eating challenge. To celebrate Kirby's victory, Kawasaki serves Kirby and his friends a really good lunch just as they requested before the challenge.

Up in the skies above Planet Popstar, a battleship where a cappy-like person named Strutter (Mr. T) discovers something that happened over at DreamLand, which gets him interested in it. However, his assistant, who also resembles a cappy, is named Benjamin (David Ogden Stiers), found out about everything, which he explained to Strutter about the new company, Popstar Dream Industries, just got the new building opened for business after Nightmare Enterprises' fall and destroyed due to Kirby's heroic victory of defeating Lord Nightmare. Fortunately, Strutter gets an idea and decides to plan on taking the building hostage on one of those days, but can't do it right now, and said he'll have to do it sometime this week but suddenly decides to drop one of his robotic minions towards DreamLand, at a beach where it is located.

Later, in Castle Dedede, King Dedede's plans for his own business are starting soon, as he explained it to Escargoon, saying that this will be better than the time that he gets to encounter Chris Rock at a store where Tuggle (Andy Samberg) works. However, the conversation ended with Captain Waddle Doo playing ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" by The Foreigner on his speaker. Meanwhile, Kirby and his friends were given a tour of the new building of Popstar Dream Industries by Professor Waddle Dee (Nia Long). The tour starts as they enter the main lobby of the Popstar Dream Industries building. It began with the main lobby that they entered, followed by a hallway that featured a snack vending machine (that included brands from the Frito-Lay company, the candy brands from Mars, which included three M&M's flavor bags, (Milk Chocolate, Peanut, and Peanut Butter) Twix, Skittles and Snickers, packs of Chips Ahoy and Oreo cookies, and other packs of trail mix), and a soda vending machine (that included soda brands from PepsiCo, such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew, 7UP, Starry, and Aquafina water bottles), a doctor's office where Doctor Waddle Dee (Breckin Mayer) works (similar to Dr. Yabui's), and a computer lair where a bunch of Waddle Dees work there. However, Susie (Kimiko Glenn), Magolor (Jack McBrayer), and Taranza (Jason Biggs) said that they will be working for the company and will be capturing the scenery between the fights and battles using Copy Abilities, Friend Abilities, Mouthful Modes, and Super Abilities. After the tour, Professor Waddle Dee thanks them for joining before waving goodbye, as he said that they ""will keep an eye on the abilities that Kirby will be using"" if they get notices. As the ritual nighttime falls, back in Castle Dedede, Tiff and Tuff's parents, Sir Elbrum (Jeff Bennett) and Lady Like (Debra Wilson), found their new bedroom to sleep in for the rest of the night, just as before Tiff and Tuff explained everything that happened recently. However, both of their parents were astonished by what happened today and said that they had a good time before going to bed. After both Tiff and Tuff went to their bedrooms, and right before going to sleep, Tiff mentioned that this will be fine like when Kirby has the time to cook a pie with his Cook ability while listening to Dolly Patron (although, a cutaway shows Cook Kirby singing along to ""Islands in The Stream"" by Dolly Patron and Kenny Loggins, while cooking an apple pie.)

Meanwhile, in Kirby's house, Kirby is relaxing in his bubble bath while enjoying his dinner, which consists of a meal from Kentucky Fried Chicken (which includes a bucket of fried chicken, a bowl of mashed potatoes with gravy, and a chocolate chip cookie). Kirby then inhaled his meal and ate it, and even drank his Sprite completely until he was full of eating and drinking. After his bath, he dried himself up with a towel and brushed his teeth before tucking himself into bed. Elfilin tells Kirby that they did a lot today and explained that he won the eating challenge at Kawasaki's restaurant. The next day, both Kirby and Elfilin were watching a breaking news bulletin that showed a robbery had just happened in Cappy Town. Together, they stopped a robbery with the help of Chief Bookem. However, it turned out to be one of Bookem's old criminals, Doron, along with one of Strutter's robotic minions, and after Bookem placed both of them under arrest for attempted robbery and locked them in a jail cell, he thinks that this is different than he had a meeting with Peter Griffin and Chris Griffin. Later, after Bookem lets Doron free from the cell, all because he didn't do it, but one of Strutter's robotic minions did it, Kirby realized everything about what's going on, so the investigation started after he explained everything along with Elfilin to his friends, Tiff, Tuff, Fololo, and Falala. They head over to the DreamLand Pop Industries building to explain about Strutter and his robotic minions, and Professor Waddle Dee gets a report that Strutter is dropping one of his robotic minions on the beach, and it would be up to Kirby to destroy it at once. Accepting the request, Kirby agrees to destroy it with one of his Copy Abilities that he will be using.

At a beach at sundown, Kine (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is relaxing while listening to ""You Get What You Give"" by New Radicals on his waterproof Bluetooth speaker, right before Kirby and his buddies show up to explain about one of Strutter's robotic minions to Meta Knight (Antonio Banderas), who shows up along with Sword Knight and Blade Knight (Bradley Cooper). After a while of the conversation, Kirby suddenly inhales a ninja sword that was thrown, thus turning into Ninja Kirby (gaining the Ninja copy ability). Marx (Chris Klein) gets excited as he prepares to watch the battle between Ninja Kirby and Strutter's ninja robotic minion, which finally begins as ""Lips Like Sugar"" by Echo & The Bunnymen plays while Ninja Kirby suddenly gains the Splash Ninja ability as done by Kine. As nighttime came, the battle ended with Ninja Kirby using his ninja sword to chop and slice the robotic ninja in half, splashing water all over it, causing a short circuit, before Ninja Kirby returned to his normal Kirby self. Kirby's friends cheered for the victory, even Marx applauded Kirby, and thinking that this is more interesting than a meeting with Patrick Star and the two M&M's spokescandies, Red (Billy West) and Yellow (JK Simmons). Later that night, at Mayor Len Blustergas' house, he heard everything that had recently happened at the beach and was proud of Kirby for destroying Strutter's robotic ninja minion with his Ninja copy ability. Hana, Bookiem, and his wife, Buttercup, came to visit as Blustergas plays ""Waiting for a Star to Fall"" by Boy Meets Girl and then served everyone, including Kirby, cups of hot cocoa. Meanwhile, at Strutter's battleship, Strutter is mad about his robotic ninja minion being defeated by Kirby's ninja ability, as reported and heard from Benjamin. Strutter gets an idea, and instead of taking the DreamLand Pop Industries hostage, he plans to have a battle with Kirby as soon as he gets to the battleship. However, he accidentally picks up a buggy car from the Forgotten Land and decides to drop it right next to Kirby's house.

The next day, both Kirby and Elfilin get ready for the day by going over to have breakfast at Kawasaki's restaurant. Thereafter, a montage starts with Kirby narrating his days in his ""poyo"" language as ""Every Breath You Take"" by The Police starts playing. The montage continues to show Kirby on his adventures, such as having breakfast with Elfilin, Kirby, and Bandana Waddle Dee, swimming at the beach, Kirby and Elfilin watching TV at Kirby's house, buying books from the book store that Biblio (Daran Norris) works, helping guiding the sheep to Shepherd (Jim Rash), Kirby waving hello, and visiting King Dedede with his open business, along with Sir Elbrum, and Lady Like, at Castle Dedede, and Kirby sitting at a table bar with his friends, Tiff, and Tuff, at Kawasaki's restaurant, with the drinks that Samo (David Herman) served. His stomach growls eventually for Kirby, meaning that he's hungry. However, Chef Nagoya (Kevin Michael Richardson) serves Kirby a chili dog for lunch. Later, Kirby and Elfilin went back to his house with the store-bought snacks that he got from Tuggle's grocery store, and Kirby turned on the TV, which showed an episode of ""The Facts of Life,"" and Kirby eats his bag of M&M's, taking piece one by one into his mouth and placing one piece on his tongue, eating it. Suddenly, a falling buggy car came from the sky, which Kirby inhales and gains the Car Mouth ability from one of his Mouthful Modes, meaning that he caught it with his mouth. Elfilin found out that it's the car that Kirby used and said that they should take it to Gus (Gary Oldman) to check it out.

At the computer lair where DreamLand Pop Industries was located, Magolor spotted Kirby with his Car Mouth ability, driving to Gus's auto repair shop and gas station, thinking that he was doing good as he told Susie about it. Meanwhile, back in Cappy Town, Kirby spat out the buggy car that he's using, which Gus takes a good look at, and decides to fix the underneath as he turns on his music, playing ""Uptown Girl"" by Billy Joel. King Dedede and Escargoon got interested as they spotted Kirby at Gus's repair shop and gas station, which caught their attention. A few minutes later, Gus has already fixed the underside of the buggy car and refilled the gas tank with his gas, saying that he has never fixed a car from a faraway place like this before. Elfilin thanks Gus for fixing it, and Gus reminds Kirby to use it if Strutter's robotic minions show up, and Kirby accepts the reminder. As the ritual nighttime falls in DreamLand, both Kirby and Elfilin are sitting at a table in Kawasaki's restaurant. After having the drinks that Samo served, Kirby hears his stomach growl, and as Elfilin tells Chef Nagoya that Kirby is famished, Nagoya tells Kawasaki about it and also tells him to serve a really good dinner. After Nagoya served Kirby and Elfilin dinner, both of their meals on each plate consisted of fried mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce and honey BBQ boneless wings. After their meals, Kirby licked his lips in delight, and Elfilin asked Nagoya for dessert, and after dessert was served by Kawasaki, each of their plates consisted of a bowl of ice cream sundae and a plate of slice of cheesecake, much to Kirby's joy, which he chows down on his ice cream sundae. After dessert, Delivery Waddle Dee (Philip Daniel Bolden) arrives at Kawasaki's restaurant and says that he's paying for the meals for both Kirby and Elfilin, and also says that he's eating here for his meal. Later, both Kirby and Elfilin went back to Kirby's house and went to bed together.

The next day, the citizens of Cappy Town, including Tiff, Tuff, Fololo, and Falala, visited Kabu (Keanu Reeves) to explain what is happening in DreamLand, in which he says that something villainous is happening, as a speech said that a cappy-like person named Strutter is planning to take hostage on the DreamLand Pop Industries, but instead, he is dropping his robotic minions that will be invading the peaceful world of DreamLand, and also states that it will be up to Kirby to stop the invasion and begin a new adventure as Strutter is wanting to battle with Kirby. However, during the announcement from Mayor Len Blustergas, Gengu (Sam Rockwell) questions whether Kirby could use his abilities and other stuff like the Mouthful Modes, Friend Abilities, and the Super Abilities, as Professor Waddle Dee said. King Dedede and Escargoon overheard everything, and one of them, King Dedede, said that Kirby is going to do it once he gets his training done with Professor Waddle Dee in the DreamLand Pop Industries. Ending the announcement, the mayor plays ""Down Under"" by Men at Work as everyone leaves.

Later on that day, Kirby went into the forest to see Whispy Woods, just to check what was going on, only to find out that there was a bit of a forest fire. Kirby inhales a bucket of water that Rick was carrying and gains the Water copy ability (meaning that he transformed into Water Kirby), and then spews out a waterfall to put the fire out, saving the entire forest from the fire. Later, as sunset came, Kirby and his friends, Elfilin, Bandana Waddle Dee, Tiff, Tuff, Fololo, and Falala visit the DreamLand Pop Industries building, where Professor Waddle Dee greets them and takes them to the computer lair, saying that Kirby did a good job using his Car Mouth ability to drive through Cappy Town. In other words, Susie also tells Kirby that he did such amazing work for destroying the robotic ninja with his Ninja copy ability and saving the entire forest by putting out the fire with the Water ability. As a result, Taranza rewards Kirby with some of his change that he has in his wallet, which makes Susie so confused about it. In the hallway where the vending machines are located, Kirby bought a small bag of Lay's potato chips, a 1-liter bottle of Mountain Dew, and a bag of Milk Chocolate M&M's with the change that Taranza gave him, and ate his bag of chips (in the same way as he did in ""Fitness Fiend""), but once he took a sip of Mountain Dew, he finds it extremely tasty and he starts chugging it down, letting out a refreshing ""ahhh"". Meanwhile, Kirby came back to the computer lair, where Professor Waddle Dee gets a report and says that he got a video message from Strutter, saying that he's planning to battle with Kirby at his battleship, because he was originally planning to take the building hostage. Professor Waddle Dee also states that to fight with Strutter, Kirby needs a good source of training and uses Copy Abilities to the test, which Tiff can accept the test and puts Kirby into training, which the training montage starts in the style of pencil sketch animation as ""Take on Me"" by Aha plays. During the montage, Kirby turns into a variety of his Copy Abilities, such as Fighter, Hammer, and others. After the training, Kirby is now ready to fight with Strutter and is already set up to use his Copy Abilities, including the Friend Abilities, Mouthful Modes, and the Super Abilities. Tiff then thanks Professor Waddle Dee for setting up Kirby for the big fight and the training, which she says that the training is much better with more than an advertising mascot meeting (although a cutaway features an advertising mascot meeting with Toucan Sam (Colin Cassidy), Tony the Tiger (Tony Daniels), Chester Cheetah (Max Koch), and Quicky the Nesquik Bunny (Barry Gordon).

Meanwhile, King Dedede and Escargoon suddenly noticed that they saw Strutter's battleship in the sky, which made them scared. Both Elfilin and Kirby wake up from their sleep, and both of them leave Kirby's house and head over to Cappy Town to see what is going on. At Gus's repair shop and gas station, Gus said the buggy car that he repaired is ready to be used, but when a ranger gun is thrown, Kirby begins the fight by suddenly inhaling the ranger gun, which made him become as Ranger Kirby, as Meta Knight already knew what this ability that Kirby is about to use. He opened fire at Strutter's robotic minions, destroying them completely. Kirby inhales the car that is right behind him, letting him use the Car Mouth ability. Fololo and Falala wish Tiff and Tuff the best of luck as the two kids, along with Bandana Waddle Dee and Elfilin, ride on Kirby's back. As the G.I. Joe theme song plays on the radio, the acceleration lets Kirby drive faster as it lets go of the gas pedal, running over Strutter's robotic minions through Cappy Town, thus beginning Kirby's new adventure. At the computer lair, Magolor and Susie watched Kirby driving away along with his friends, as both of them wished Kirby good luck. During this, King Dedede leaves his castle as he told Escargoon to keep an eye on the castle, and he starts attacking the robotic minions with his giant hammer and his powerful moves. When the buggy car jumps up into the sky, just as Kirby spits out the buggy car, Tiff calls the warp star, as Kabu sends out the warp star to Kirby, who rides on it, allowing his friends to ride with him, thus taking Kirby and his friends to Strutter's battleship.

Inside Strutter's battleship, the warp star drops off Kirby and his friends, and Kirby places his warp star to a small size, which Tiff said that he can keep in case something happens, as Kirby placed it inside his pocket after putting it back in the case. Suddenly, the lights go dim as the door closes, leaving the whole room dark. Kirby suddenly spots a giant lightbulb and inhales it, gaining another Mouthful Mode, Light-Bulb Mouth. Kirby then turns on by illuminating in the dark room and leads the way, and Tiff and the others follow him. After leaving the dark room, Kirby turns off the light and spits out the lightbulb, turning himself back to his normal self, to which Tiff tells Kirby to keep up the good work. In the next room, Kirby and his friends saw another one of Strutter's robotic minions that was vine-covered and filled with leaves. Kirby starts the fight after he gains the Cutter ability from the thrown buzzsaw that he inhaled. After the battle, where he slices the robotic minion into pieces, leaving electric sparks alight, as Cutter Kirby turns back to normal, before seeing a pipe that runs water. Kirby runs to it and sucks it up from the pipe, making him gain his Water-Balloon Mouth ability, which then sprays water everywhere as he bursts through a wooden wall in a style of the Kool Aid man's, with Tiff and the others follow Kirby, causing the electric sparks to cause a short circuit and have the room set on fire. In the next room, Kirby spat out all the water that he had inhaled to the robotic minions, which then resulted in short circuits, and Kirby returned to normal as Tiff and his friends cheered for him. Meanwhile, in the same room that was set on fire, Strutter sees this and panics as he puts out the fire with a fire extinguisher. Strutter then returns to his flight deck to see who is behind all of this, which turned out to be Kirby, much to his interest and his frustration. Strutter drops down more of his robotic minions in the same room as Kirby and his friends were in, which made Kirby more determined. Strutter then also dropped a giant bomb along with Poppy Bros. Jr., which Kirby then inhales the pair of them and granting him the Bomb copy ability. Bomb Kirby throws multiple bombs at Strutter's robotic minions, which makes Strutter leave to get a drink. After the robotic minions were destroyed by the bombs that were thrown, Kirby turned back to normal and led the way as Tiff and the others followed him to the next room.

In the next room, Kirby gains the Hammer ability after inhaling a giant hammer that was thrown by one of the robotic minions that Strutter dropped, thus beginning the battle where Hammer Kirby hits the robotic minion hard several times. After all of that, the robotic minion was destroyed, and Kirby turned back to normal. In the next room, Kirby is suddenly surrounded by a group of Strutter's robotic minions, but he knows what to do after Strutter's assistant, Benjamin, lets him know that he needs to battle with Strutter once he's done. Not noticing that he left a microphone on the top floor, and after Tiff and Tuff (except for Elfilin and Bandana Waddle Dee, who got his ear plugs ready) get scared as they run for safety in another room, and are ready to cover their ears since both Tiff has heard everything about Kirby's microphone ability (twice in Castle Dedede), Kirby completely inhales Benjamin's microphone from the top floor and gets the Mike ability. At the flight deck, Strutter was about to drink his Sprite, but suddenly spat out as he heard Kirby's singing from another camera, showing Mike Kirby singing to ""Sister Christian"" by Night Ranger, and his robotic minions covering their ears due to the bad singing, except for Elfilin who enjoys it, as Bandana Waddle Dee explains that Kirby's bad singing is worse than Bob Dylan's. As Kirby continues singing, the robotic minions explode into bits, and the room begins to crumble. After the song, Kirby discards the Mike ability (like he does in the Kirby games), turning him back to normal, meaning that it is now safe for Kirby's voice to go back to normal. Tiff and Tuff went back to Kirby safely as Bandana Waddle Dee took off his earplugs. Tiff reminded Kirby to be careful next time after he told him that he did a good job destroying the robotic minions.

Kirby leads the way and Tiff and the others follow him, leaving the crumbling room that the Mike ability that caused, following to the next remaining room, where Kirby gains the Fire ability after inhaling a flying fireball and fights off the oil-covered robotic minion that Strutter dropped, which burns it alive, destroying it completely before Kirby turns back to normal. However, Kirby gains the ice ability after inhaling ice blocks that were dropping on the floor, in which he uses his ice breath to freeze the burning robotic minion that he fought off, which turns it into a giant ice cube before discarding the Ice ability, leaving him back to normal. Meanwhile, back in DreamLand, King Dedede continued to use his moves and his giant hammer to destroy the robotic minions, while Meta Knight used his Galaxia sword to destroy most of the robots along with Blade Knight and Sword Knight. A while later, back in Strutter's battleship, after destroying the robotic minions with the Copy Abilities that Kirby used, Kirby, who has turned back to normal, along with his friends, arrived at the flight deck and lobby to see Strutter, who is impressed to see him. Determined, Kirby lets Tiff take control of the battleship and lets Tuff and the others take care of everything in the battleship while he gets ready to battle as Strutter grabs his weapon. Kirby dodges the attacks by Strutter that he tries to use, but presses the alarm button, letting out a loud noise outside the battleship, which lets Meta Knight know, as he sets up the Halberd along with Sword Knight and Blade Knight. However, Magolor lets him know that he'll be taking care of the battle that Kirby is having with Strutter, but also said that Kirby is also going to need the Ultra Sword just to finish the battle once he's done using the Sword ability.

Soon, the Halberd is set to launch into the sky. After Kirby managed to continue dodging Strutter's attacks that caused holes in the walls of the lobby and flight deck, Meta Knight, who arrives at the battleship, along with the Halberd that he's controlling, throws a sword that Kirby inhales, letting him get the Sword ability. The true final battle begins as Sword Kirby hits Strutter's weapon several times, causing holes in the walls that were damaged. Once Strutter is useless against the weapon he's using, Sword Kirby uses a sword beam to damage Strutter completely, injuring him badly. Magolor arrives and gives Kirby the Ultra Sword ability, in which he does so after discarding the Sword ability and right before inhaling it, which made him become Ultra Sword Kirby. Frightened, Strutter is trying to get away from Ultra Sword Kirby, but fails as Ultra Sword Kirby finishes him off with a giant Ultra Sword that he is using (similar to his final smash from Super Smash Bros.), by slashing him away right into the ocean, which causes a huge hole in the wall, damaging Strutter's battleship mostly, and ending the final battle. Ultra Sword Kirby turns back into the normal Kirby self as Tiff and the others cheer for him, including Magolor, Sword Knight, Blade Knight, and the staff at DreamLand Pop Industries. After the hug that Kirby gives to his friends, the battleship begins a self-destruct, making Benjamin panic and abandon ship and heading to the ocean that Strutter was flung off by the Ultra Sword, and Kirby summons his Warp Star, which he kept, and he and the others jump onto the warp star, letting it fly to the sky safely. During the escape, the Warp Star that Kirby and his friends are riding on is suddenly knocked down by the debris that was from Strutter's battleship, which made them fall off of it, but Kirby recovers it by placing the knocked-off Warp Star back into the case safely. The Halberd arrives, rescuing Kirby and his friends from the fall, while Meta Knight saves them from the falling debris from Strutter's battleship. After safely landing on the Halberd that rescued Kirby and his friends, it turned out to be Meta Knight, who is controlling the Halberd all the time. After the Halberd escapes the destruction, the damaging Strutter's battleship crash-lands into the ocean before exploding completely.

Back in DreamLand, everything went back to normal after Strutter's robotic minions disappeared into the distance, and Cappy Town was rebuilt into perfect condition. Everyone, including King Dedede, Escargoon and Captain Waddle Doo are now happy to see Kirby and his friends back after the battle, even King Dedede said that he missed Kirby, although he left an apology note for him. After reading it, Kirby hugs King Dedede in pure joy. Tiff and Tuff hugged their parents, including Fololo and Falala, saying that they missed them and were proud of them. Mayor Len Blustergas says that he is proud of Kirby for defeating Strutter with his Sword and Ultra Sword abilities and destroying the battleship, and also states that everyone in Cappy Town will be having a party to dedicate to Kirby (similar to how they do in ""Kirby Takes the Cake""). Susie, Meta Knight, and Magolor, who just came back from the Halberd, are amazed and are proud of doing an amazing job for DreamLand Pop Industries, because Kirby has been using his Copy Abilities, Mouthful Modes, and the Ultra Sword ability in the final battle that Kirby finished. Everyone cheered for Kirby, and Tiff hugged him, making him happy. A news bulletin shows that Kirby became the greatest Star Warrior in all of Planet Popstar, as told by Laura and Tara, the newscasters of DreamLand News.

On the next day, at the town hall where a sing-along party is held, everyone, including Tiff and Tuff's parents, Lady Like and Sir Elbrum, Honey, Iro and Spikehead's parents, Chief Bookem and his wife, Buttercup, Hana, Biblio, Gengu, Doron, Gus, Mabel, and the other cappy villagers are dancing and singing along to ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" by Tears for Fears, including King Dedede with his successful business at Castle Dedede, along with Escargoon, the Waddle Dees and Captain Waddle Doo, Magolor, Taranza, Susie, Professor Waddle Dee, Doctor Waddle Dee, and the staff at the DreamLand Pop Industries building celebrating Kirby's victory, Meta Knight, Sword Knight, Blade Knight, and his minions (which are Meta-Knights), along with the Star Warriors, Sir Arthur, Sir Galahad, Sir Percival, and Sir Lancelot at the Halberd, and finally at Kirby's house, where Tiff, Tuff, Fololo, Falala, Rick, Kine (who is in a pool), Coo and Tokkori are celebrating Kirby's victory with a barbecue that Kirby is working on. Kirby, Bandana Waddle Dee, and Elfilin perform Kirby's victory dance to this song, before ending the song with them striking poses to the camera. The star iris closes on Kirby who happily waves goodbye, ending the movie and starting the end credits with pictures that featured Kirby and his friends having fun in DreamLand, with the Copy Abilities that have been used by Kirby, including Parasol, Cook, Whip, Drill and other Copy Abilities as ""September"" by Earth, Wind & Fire plays in the background.

hi all! so i (28f with endo and pcos) had my egg retrieval on May 1 and had shockingly good results. They retrieved 29 eggs, 23 fertilized, and 21 made it to freezing. We're currently waiting for genetic testing results. My wife (37f) and I are beside ourselves with joy, as she did 2 ERs and did not have great results—3 retrieved with first ER, all 3 fertilized, 1 made it to freezing with good genetic testing results. On the second ER, 4 were retrieved, and none made it to blast. With my history of endo (I had a pretty extensive excision surgery last year, stage 2 endo on my right side and a huge cluster of cysts on my left), I was really not expecting positive results, especially with what my initial FSH levels were at my pre-cycle bloodwork. I guess I just responded to the meds really well? Truly, I am having a bit of what feels like survivors' guilt with this because I have no idea how I got so lucky here or what I did to deserve it.

Anyway, now that I got all of my IVF background out there, I wanted to share that it's been 18 days since my ER and I am still having a decent amount of discomfort. My wife (she's an athlete, super strong, never gets sick, healthiest person alive lol, high af pain tolerance) was literally fine after both of her ERs. After the first one, she had a little bit of spotting and soreness, but said that was pretty much it and the second one didn't really affect her at all. I, however, could barely walk after mine. Because of the high number of eggs retrieved, my age and my PCOS history, I was at high risk for OHSS, which my sister had when she was doing IVF, so she gave me lots of advice. I was eating so much salt it was insane, just straight-up drinking pickle juice, only drinking zero sugar liquid IV and gatorade, getting salted caramel lattes as my morning coffee (idk how much actual salt is in those but I just really needed coffee lol). The bloating and pain were insane, I looked like I was already 5 months pregnant and was in the most discomfort I'd been in since my endo surgery, but after about a week of that, it finally started to die down.

Of course, as soon as all of that got better, I got my period. I had a Mirena IUD placed during my endo surgery and have thankfully not had a period in many months, so when I noticed bleeding, I was surprised, but it seemed to make sense. My doctor said the hormone come-down can cause some cycle changes, so I just rolled with it. But of course, it was like the endo cramps I worked so hard to get rid of were back for revenge. It wasn't a heavy period, but it was certainly painful, like having to go to the CVS near my office to get a heating pad for my desk in the middle of the work day painful. The bleeding finally stopped about 2 days ago, but I'm still getting cramps on and off throughout the day. 

I haven't had a kid yet, obviously lol, but these cramps feel like a less painful version of what I would imagine labor contractions feel like. Like they keep coming and going, and they feel like a radiating sharp cramp from my abdomen down to my tailbone and even upper thighs. It's not so bad that I can't get anything done, but wow, is it frustrating. I feel so weak, I just want to get back to normal life but I'm in pain, and I can't even get into the mood side effects of this hormone come-down lol. I get upset because my wife was completely fine after both ERs and I'm just a delicate flower who needs a month+ to recover from this very common procedure and I hate it. My sister keeps reminding me that the doctor was in there for a lot longer with me, but still, everything I've read on here, most people said they were pretty much fine after a week or so, unless they had severe OHSS.

Did anyone else have an ER recovery that took this long? I feel insane and like I have the most fragile body on earth. ",2,1747687536.0,IVF,1,1.0,False

Thank you for taking the time to help. I’m planning a trip for mid-June and used the search bar to gather as much info as possible (Thank you). 

I have a rough draft of my itinerary and would love some feedback mainly because I’m not sure how much time to allocate to each viewpoint or activity, esp considering it’s peak season, traffic, and parking etc

Day 1
- Arrive from Yosemite to Monterey/Carmel by the Sea around 12pm
- Check in
- Lunch in downtown Carmel, explore a bit, and grab a drink
- Start the 17-Mile Drive 
- Sunset at one of the viewpoints or Carmel Beach

Day 2 (a long one!)
- Breakfast: we’re coffee + breakfast burrito to go type people
- Point Lobos State Natural Reserve, start the loop trail around 8-9am (planning to spend 3–4 hours hiking and exploring)
- scenic stops: (Bixby Bridge, Hurricane Point)
- Lunch at Nepenthe or Café Kevah (since we kept breakfast is light, we are planning to drive past Garrapata to grab some food & take some rest & then come back)? 
- Drive back to Garrapata State Park & do what our energy levels allow. Most likely Soberanes Point and Garrapata Bluff Trail. From what I have read, both are low impact and take about 30–40 minutes. Stay there for the sunset. 

Day 3 
- head back to SF. We are going to stop by at some of the PCH viewpoints heading back to SF (but not hiking or anything. Staying in SF over night. Taking off the next day (day 4). 

# help & info # 
- Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park isn’t on our list this time. From what I’ve read, you can only see like a glimpse of McWay Falls due to the road closure. We plan to do the full PCH drive another time and don’t want to rush for the sake of scratching things off. But I know we can still go?? The redwood trails etc are open right? So should we go?? Or this might congest things? 
- same with aquarium. looks amazing, but we’re not sure if we have the time. esp since the tickets are pricey, we want to make sure we can actually take our time to go through it.
- I’d love to have some beach time but it’s not part of the plan yet because I’m unsure if there’s time. If anyone sees an opportunity where I can tweak things, lmk. (If not, no worries.)
- Evenings are reserved for dinner and nothing much tbh.

1kqmlpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/thirdworldproblems/comments/1kqmlpm/vebetterdao_an_opportunity_to_earn_with/,VeBetterDao - An opportunity to earn with responsible environmental action,"I would like to start with saying that I in no way have a horse in this race, but see an opportunity in a technology that I’ve been enthusiastic about for years, for people living paycheck to paycheck, to make things easier for themselves.

Explanation VeBetterDao is an ecosystem on a L1 blockchain called Vechain (r/Vechain for more info if you’re curious about the underlying tech). They’ve developed a system that rewards the user, for tangible actions to improve their carbon footprint.

example - Bubbles let’s you take a picture of you refilling your reusable water bottle, up to 5 times per day. Every action taken, gives you 1 B3TR. This token, has a current value of $0.08. So your max potential earning is, at current B3TR market value, $40 cents per day.

Yes, it’s not a lot, I agree. However, it adds up. Rather than buy coffee, like most financially challenged people, you make it yourself. You take a picture, and start earning money because you’re using a porcelain/steel/reusable cup.

Out grocery shopping? Take a picture of the receipt, and get rewarded up to 90 B3TR for using a recyclable bag and buying vegetables.

Eco-friendly meal? Take a picture, get rewarded.

Hanging up your clothes to dry instead of using a tumbler? Get paid while saving on electricity.

For us, with 3 users, and, to be honest not all that much use, we’re looking at $2-3000 extra per year, from doing things we’re allready doing.

**No one does anything for free, and neither does Vechain** - however, the business aspect of this, to keep it simple, is Carbon Credits. 1 metric ton of Carbon Credits, can be sold for €70 euros. Every single time you perform an action, there is a measurable CO2 savings, that they can turn around and sell.

I can warmly reccomend downloading VeWallet from the app store, and testing it. If you have any questions, go to the r/Vechain sub, and ask.

The difficulty part will be when it comes time to sell your B3TR tokens for cash, and transfer it to your bank account. This requires you to register to a trading site, or use one of the apps on VeWorld, and send it to your IBAN (unique bank id adress). Some simply register their creditcard for near instant transfers, but I’m hesitant myself to do that.

Best of luck, hope this helps out some of you that are struggling!",2,1747687295.0,thirdworldproblems,0,1.0,False

I’m *somewhat* smell sensitive, but it’s inconsistent. Like, I LOVE a high quality incense, but I never cook with a crockpot because I can’t stand smelling the food all day. Doing next day dishes is overstimulating because of the SMELL, not necessarily the touch. Does that make any sense?

Essential oil diffusers are not my jam. Idk exactly why I have the ick, but I think it’s because they trigger memories of relatives that I’m really not a fan of, haha. I tried one of the more ‘natural’ febreeze plugins for a bit, and while I loved coming home to a nice fresh scent, it would overpower the little bathroom it was plugged into and leave yellow stains on the wall… and ultimately I know it’s not the safest for pets. I’m considering trying Pura, but I’ve just heard they’re not very powerful. And god, those refills are fucking expensive. Candles often give me and my kids headaches…

I already had an interview and this month, I got a call from the manager that he was interested in having me over at the restaurant. I'm unsure about this opportunity based off of how my interview went. I do have a job currently as of typing this. I work in the food service - coffee shop - for 3 years. I'm curious to know if anyone has worked as a janitor for this restaurant before and what it's like. 

I'll give a brief detail about how the interview went:
 I had an interview on April 13th. The interview was only a minute. I never got the chance to ask any questions. I was told that their former janitor had recently quit and were desperate in finding a replacement. The manager told me at the end to give him a call for an update about the job. I don't know why he would say that to me. 🤷🏾‍♀️

 Three weeks later, I called the restaurant 3 times on seperate days for an update on my application in which I was placed on hold for 15 minutes.
Today, I got a call back from the same manager that interviewed me about wanting to meet up tomorrow but with a different person this time.

I don't know how important this part is, but I am a person of color and a woman. I want to get insight about the job and making sure I'm making the right decision before I accept this job.

First off, I’m terrible at initiating and small talk and taking hints. I get nervous and before I commit talking to a girl, I decide to just drop it and my mind automatically thinks it’ll never go anywhere anyways. I am trying to get away from that type of thinking and to be more initiative. The answer will always be no unless you try right? 😭😅. 

She works at Ross as a security guard and I’ve seen her the few times I needed to go there. Caught my eye the first time I saw her but I just went about my day. The third time we did interact just a tiny bit and I took a chance and complemented her hair since it was dyed blue(at this point I still didn’t think anything about asking her out and to just carry on with my day). The last time I went for a return, idk most likely I was imagining it but I felt like there was a lot of glances. She’s the guard by the door so I get she’s probably being courteous or just scouting the area. We smiled at each other and said our goodbyes. Also I don’t even know if she’s into girls or if she’s single. She does look to be about my age.

Now I’ve decided to go for it. Was planning on dropping by this week and since she’s working and me not wanting to put her on the spot or make her uncomfortable, I was planning on handing her my phone number on a piece of paper and saying something along the lines of “hey! I thought you’re cute and would like to get to know you more. Here’s my number if you’re interested but no pressure or anything!” She does work at the front so I’ve also thought about just giving her the paper and saying “wanted to give this to you, feel free to throw it away if you’re not interested” or something. The paper will have my number, name and probs if she wants to go for a coffee or drink. 

Would this be a good idea or should I just drop the idea all together 😭. I know people can be iffy on being asked out while working which is why I thought about just handing her my number instead. If she says no or doesn’t text, I plan to avoid that Ross for like 2 months or something anyways 😂😂. ",2,1747687026.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

In our 2yr relationship, I feel extremely alone. It hasn't always been like this, he was sneezing at first, but when reality started kicking in, so the issues begin. Small issues keep being dragged until we are both exhausted and give up, but nothing ever gets resolved this way. I built up resentment and distrust. If I bring up an issue, I'm accused of limiting him because ""everything he does hurts me"". Note: I never prevented him from doing anything, in any way. If I keep small things that hurt me to myself, I'm accused of hiding them from him. Which doesn't work anyway, because you can read it in my face when I'm not feeling OK. I can't win. 

Lately, I expressed being uncomfortable with him chatting with a particular woman. I do not know why I felt like this. I have never been a jealous type, and I think part of the reason for my current insecurity is the fact that I don't feel loved nor seen in the relationship to begin with. I expressed this very vulnerably, literally asking him ""can you reassure me about this, I feel very uncomfortable"". He even admitted it was a bit weird that she was contacting him privately, but that he had no interest in her besides being a good neighbour. He has many female friends and I have absolutely no issues with them. But this is a single, stranger, and beautiful woman who happens to be his neighbour. I assumed he understood me and we didn't discuss the issue again. The idea came up a couple of times because he complained about ""not being able to even lend the drilling machine to his neighbours as that would make me insecure"", to which I replied that I never considered that an issue and didn't ask further.

Well fast forward to today, 2.5 months after me expressing my concern. Me and him were having a drink, and his phone lights up with her name. I'm immediately confused, and he says not to worry, and that I should look at the conversation to see it's nothing (which I never in my life asked to do, and also don't like the thought of it). He puts his phone in front of me and as I just move my finger the chat scrolls upwards. DOZEN OF MESSAGES. Nothing incriminating, friendly banter, but almost daily, mentioning coffee and wine, for months. Starting the literal day after I expressed my concern. I lost it. He accused me of making a scene. I'm so confused, hurt and betrayed. He keeps saying that he did absolutely nothing wrong and he doesn't understand why I am so insecure, that he can't take me seriously and can't tolerate our fights out of nothing all the time, and that ""yes they messaged, so what?"" According to him, he didn't tell me because ""see how you would have reacted?"". Apparently, he wouldn't ever tell me if this didn't show up. I'm still shocked, and a loss of words. To me, it really feels like he did something that he knew would hurt me, and he did it behind my back, for months. He put chats with a random stranger before the feelings and trust of his partner. And he is STILL talking to her now that we are in the middle of this fight, daily.

I am trying to process it, to understand his point of view, and to navigate his complete lack of accountability. He says ""I take full accountability, but I did nothing wrong talking to a neighbour, I'm just friendly and this is who I am, it is wrong to avoid people, and I couldn't tell you because look at your reaction""). 
I feel I just can't. I guess I need a word of comfort, somebody to tell me if I'm doing everything wrong or asking for too much, shared experiences, or maybe somebody to give me the strength to love myself more",0,1747686969.0,relationship_advice,5,0.33,False

**Explanation**
VeBetterDao is an ecosystem on a L1 blockchain called Vechain (/r/Vechain for more info if you’re curious about the underlying tech). They’ve developed a system that rewards the user, for tangible actions to improve their carbon footprint. 

*example* - Bubbles let’s you take a picture of you refilling your reusable water bottle, up to 5 times per day. Every action taken, gives you 1 B3TR. This token, has a current value of $0.08. So your max potential earning is, at current B3TR market value, $40 cents per day. 

Yes, it’s not a lot, I agree. However, it adds up. Rather than buy coffee, like most financially challenged people, you make it yourself. You take a picture, and start earning money because you’re using a porcelain/steel/reusable cup. 

Out grocery shopping? Take a picture of the receipt, and get rewarded up to 90 B3TR for using a recyclable bag and buying vegetables. 

Eco-friendly meal? Take a picture, get rewarded. 

Hanging up your clothes to dry instead of using a tumbler? Get paid while saving on electricity. 

For us, with 3 users, and, to be honest not all that much use, we’re looking at $2-3000 extra per year, from doing things we’re allready doing. 

**No one does anything for free, and neither does Vechain** - however, the business aspect of this, to keep it simple, is Carbon Credits. 1 metric ton of Carbon Credits, can be sold for €70 euros. Every single time you perform an action, there is a measurable CO2 savings, that they can turn around and sell. 

**I can warmly reccomend downloading VeWallet from the app store**, and testing it. If you have any questions, go to the /r/Vechain sub, and ask. 

The difficulty part will be when it comes time to sell your B3TR tokens for cash, and transfer it to your bank account. This requires you to register to a trading site, or use one of the apps on VeWorld, and send it to your IBAN (unique bank id adress). Some simply register their creditcard for near instant transfers, but I’m hesitant myself to do that.

I have a partner, who I’ve been with for around 10+ years. When I met him, he was really great at looking after himself and consuming food ect.. then A traumatic experience happened (I won’t go into detail, but let’s say it did put a massive emotional toll on the both of us). He refused to eat much. Snacking here and there and living off iced coffee. Eventually he got better, and when things started looking up in our life, he thrived. Fast forward to this year and last year. My partner has been really depressed in the last year, not eating much, ⚠️ trigger warning ⚠️ suicidal thoughts (But not anymore though!), doom scrolling on social media, not showering for months, emotions all over the place. Some days just grumpy. Barely changing his clothes. (I’ve had to wash him clothes for him, and ask him to change multiple times). It’s even gotten worse this year. Especially the last couple of months. Basically I’ve just kind of dealt with it. He snaps at me if I tell him he should have a shower, or ask him to eat something. He says “I just don’t like being controlled and told what to do”. Anyways, the last few days.. I’ve noticed his gotten even worse than I’ve ever seen him before. Since Saturday, he’s eaten very little. Saturday he ate 1/4 of a spring roll. He ate some stir fry on Sunday (maybe 4-5 mouth fulls?) and the rest got put in the fridge around 4pm. Monday, about a mouth full of stir fry (he waited until 11am for the food place to open), and he’s refused food since..it’s currently 6:00am on Tuesday. Within those days, I’ve been hearing him gagging, coughing and complaining of a sore stomach. He’s been on and off sleeping for the last 12 hours. He says he’s freezing cold (I suggested him having a shower).. nope.. he says “I don’t want a f-ing shower. It’s too cold”. I have expressed how this has made myself and our kids feel. I’ve also said that as a parent, it’s his responsibility to look after our kids too but in order to do that he has to look after himself. I made a doctors appointment for him yesterday, and he refused to go. He cancled it and said “there’s no point in going. They aren’t going to help.” 

I do feel like he has a ED. He’s gone off the taste of him favourite meals, he very rarely eats much and just lives off his iced coffee. He won’t even eat my home cooked meals. And when I offer him a mouth full of something I’ve made, he refuses it. I’ve been asking him to go to the doctors for month. But this time it’s gotten really serious. 

I’m at my absolute wits end, I don’t know what to do. It’s gotten to the point where I’m so worried that I’m just going to find him gone when I go check on him

Should I call an ambulance? The hospital? The doctors? Anyone who’s been in similar or have witnessed similar, please send some advice my way.

*Several Years Later: Gamma Outpost, Haven*

The hum of Gamma Outpost was a familiar symphony to Leo. Life here had found its rhythm, a unique cadence dictated by the harsh beauty of Haven and the symbiotic partnership with the Glyphs. Children born on the outpost grew up understanding that their furry, six-legged companions were more than just pets; they were potential lifesavers, silent partners in survival. The Gamma Accords were not just rules, but a way of life. Leo, now bearing the quiet authority of experience, often found himself mentoring newer arrivals, guiding them through the initial, bewildering stages of Glyph bonding under the established safety protocols. Anya, her technical expertise honed by years of studying Glyph bio-energetics, co-managed the outpost’s modest research division. Jax, his booming laugh still echoing in the mess hall, was a respected senior trainer for utility morphs, ensuring new colonists learned to lift heavy loads or reinforce tools safely with their Glyph partners.

The news, when it finally arrived via the long-range comms buoy, sent a ripple of anticipation and trepidation through the community: TFACA Task Force Xenostar was en route. ETA: three weeks. Their mission: assess the ""Haven Symbiote Phenomenon"" firsthand.

""Took them long enough,"" Jax grumbled over synth-coffee, Boulder contentedly gnawing on a nutrient-enriched chew stick at his feet. ""Probably spent two years just arguing about the budget for the fuel.""

Anya smiled faintly, reviewing data on a handheld. ""Bureaucracy moves at its own pace, Jax. The fact they're sending a dedicated Xenobiological Task Force means they’re taking it seriously. This isn't just a colonial welfare check.""

Leo felt a familiar prickle of anxiety. He’d re-read their initial report countless times, wondering how it had been received light-years away. He looked at Scamp, who was curled on a nearby console, fur shifting in subtle patterns. Query: Leo-host anticipates social interaction stress? Scamp can simulate calming pheromone release, if required.

Thanks, buddy, but I think I’ll manage, Leo thought back, a wry amusement touching his mind. The depth of their connection still sometimes surprised him. Over the years, the sensory bleed-through from Scamp had become more pronounced, a constant subtle overlay to his own perceptions. Sometimes, walking through the hydroponics bay, he’d catch faint chemical traces in the air that no un-synced human could detect, a preternatural awareness of plant health or potential contaminants. Around complex machinery, he’d occasionally see faint energy patterns, halos of light Scamp perceived as part of its core sensory input. He’d mentioned it cautiously to Anya, who’d logged it as ""advanced host-symbiote sensory integration,"" but mostly, he kept these experiences to himself. It felt too personal, too strange to articulate fully.

The arrival of the TFACA fleet was less an arrival and more a stately occupation of Haven’s orbital space. Sleek, silver cruisers and bulky science vessels dwarfed Gamma’s own aging support ships. The primary delegation landed via a heavily escorted shuttle: Dr. Aris Thorne, a renowned xenobiologist with intelligent, piercing eyes and an air of intense curiosity; Commander Valerius, a stern-faced military man whose gaze seemed to assess everything for threat potential; and Administrator Chen, a pragmatic bureaucrat with a polite but unreadable expression.

The initial days were a carefully choreographed dance. Gamma’s leadership, with Chief Borin still at the helm, presented their findings: years of accumulated data on Sync Rates, morphic capabilities, the Accords, and the overall stability of the human-Glyph integration on the outpost. Dr. Thorne, in particular, devoured the information, her questions sharp and insightful. Commander Valerius remained stoic, observing the colonists and their Glyphs with an unsettling focus.

""Your 'Sync Rate' metric is fascinating, Dr. Aris,"" Thorne commented during a tour of the training facility, watching a young colonist successfully manifest a minor grip enhancement with her Glyph, ""Fuzzball."" ""The correlation between neural harmony and controlled morphic expression… it suggests a level of co-regulation we rarely see in symbiotic relationships, especially interspecies ones with such… dramatic physical manifestations.""

Then came an unexpected data point. During one of Thorne’s observation sessions in the residential block, a commotion arose. Young Timmy, one of the outpost children, let out a yelp. His cherished pet Flitwing – a native Haven creature resembling a large, furry moth, domesticated by the colonists – had snagged its delicate wing on a protruding wire. Timmy was distraught, tears welling. His Glyph, ""Patches,"" a particularly fluffy specimen, reacted instantly to Timmy’s distress. Patches nuzzled the injured Flitwing, and a faint, almost imperceptible shimmer of energy seemed to pass between them. Dr. Thorne, who had been observing nearby, leaned closer, her scanner suddenly active.

Within minutes, the bleeding on the Flitwing’s wing stopped. By the end of the hour, the tear looked remarkably less severe, the tissue already knitting back together at a rate that defied normal biology.

""Remarkable,"" Thorne murmured, studying her scanner. ""The Glyph didn't morph. It… facilitated healing. Accelerated cellular regeneration in a non-host organism, triggered by the host's emotional state. This wasn't in your initial report, Chief Borin.""

Borin shrugged. ""We’ve seen things like it, Doctor. Minor scrapes on outpost pets healing faster if a Glyph is around and its host is concerned. We chalked it up to… well, one more strange thing about them. Never had a way to quantify it.""

Thorne made extensive notes, her gaze thoughtful. ""Benevolent bio-manipulation… interesting.""

The TFACA scientists, under Thorne’s direction, conducted their own studies – non-invasive scans, detailed biological sampling (shed fur, skin cells, waste products), and controlled observation of morphic events. Leo, as one of the original and most deeply synced individuals, was a prime subject. Under the cold, impersonal gaze of TFACA sensors, he demonstrated basic defensive morphs with Scamp – the knuckle armor, the small utility claws.

Host biometrics stable, Scamp would transmit calmly during these sessions. Symbiote energy expenditure within predicted parameters. TFACA personnel exhibit elevated cortisol levels, indicative of mild stress. Query: Should Scamp offer them a chew toy?

Probably best not, Scamp, Leo would think, trying to suppress a smile.

The psychological benefits were also noted. Colonists with Glyphs reported significantly lower instances of isolation-induced stress and depression, common ailments on frontier outposts. The constant companionship, even if initially based on ""affection simulation"" as Scamp had once put it, had evolved into genuine emotional bonds.

Commander Valerius, however, focused on the weapon aspect. He requested a demonstration of the full arm-blade. Leo refused, politely but firmly, backed by Chief Borin. ""The Accords are clear, Commander. That level of morph is for life-or-death situations only. We don't trigger it for show."" Valerius’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t press the issue further.

Internally, within the TFACA delegation, debates were clearly ongoing. Dr. Thorne was visibly excited by the scientific potential. Administrator Chen saw both immense opportunity – for hazardous environment operations, for enhanced human capability – and a logistical nightmare of regulation and control. Commander Valerius remained the voice of caution, emphasizing the inherent dangers of biological weapons, even seemingly benevolent ones.

As the weeks passed, Leo felt the subtle shifts in his own perception intensify under the scrutiny. The faint energy patterns Scamp saw around the TFACA’s advanced scanning equipment were more vivid, almost distracting. He caught whiffs of unfamiliar chemicals on the scientists’ lab coats, scents Scamp identified as cleaning agents and residual research compounds. He didn’t voice these experiences, unsure if they were symptoms of stress or a genuine deepening of his bond. He was living proof of the symbiosis, yet he felt like he was only scratching the surface of what it truly meant.

Finally, the TFACA assessment period drew to a close. Administrator Chen announced their preliminary decision: ""The Haven Symbiote phenomenon is… unprecedented. The potential is undeniable, as are the risks. A comprehensive report will be compiled for the Federation Council. In the interim, TFACA is authorizing a limited transfer.""

His gaze fell on Anya. ""Dr. Sharma, your expertise in Glyph bio-energetics and your established Sync with your partner, Pixel, would be invaluable for further study under controlled conditions on Earth. We request your voluntary participation in Phase Two of this assessment.""

Anya looked surprised, then a spark of excitement lit her eyes. She glanced at Pixel, who chirped softly. ""I… I accept, Administrator.""

A small team of Gamma volunteers, including Anya and a few others with stable Sync Rates and diverse Glyph expressions, would accompany the Task Force back to Earth. They would be pioneers, ambassadors for this strange new form of partnership.

Leo watched the shuttle ascend, carrying Anya, Pixel, and the others towards the waiting starships. He felt a pang of… something. Not jealousy, but a sense of a chapter closing, and another, uncertain one, beginning. Scamp nudged his hand.

Anya-host and Pixel-host depart. Mission parameters: unknown. Probability of return: high.

Yeah, Scamp. High. Leo thought. He looked up at the indifferent stars, where the fate of the Glyphs, and perhaps humanity's relationship with them, would now be debated light-years away. The first contact was over. Now came the long wait for Earth’s verdict.

CHAPTER ONE

Keira awoke on Bryn’s lumpy couch with a crick in her neck and freezing feet. The temperature in New York City was growing chilly, with fall in the air. But despite the lumpy couch and the shivers, Keira woke in the best mood ever.

Today, October 22nd, Keira was going back to work in her new, more senior and better paid role at

Viatorum

magazine. She was looking forward to seeing Nina, her friend and editor at the magazine, and was itching to get back to her passion of writing again. What her next assignment would be she did not yet know, but she was certain it wouldn’t be quite as exhilarating as her last month in Ireland.

Elliot was bound to give her something a little more low-key this time and Keira was absolutely fine with that. She’d barely had time to readjust to life back in New York City, to catch up with her friends and mom. And besides, Shane was coming to visit in a week and that was something Keira was far more excited about than jet-setting.

Just then, her older sister, Bryn, rushed into the living room, her hair a mess, hopping with one shoe on, one shoe off.

“I’m late for work,” Bryn stammered. “Why didn’t you wake me?”

Keira checked the clock.

“Because it’s seven. You don’t have to leave for an hour.” She laughed at her perpetually scatterbrained sister.

Bryn stopped and squinted at the clock, then did a double take. “Oh yeah.” She kicked off her one shoe and came and sat next to Keira on the couch. “I really thought I’d be better at life by the time I hit thirty,” she mused.

Keira smiled. “Never.”

Growing up was not something either of the Swanson sisters were in a rush to do.

Bryn leaned over then and nudged Keira. “So… first day back at work after your break. How are you feeling?”

“I feel good,” Keira said. “It’s going to be different without Joshua there to ruin everyone’s mood. Mainly I’m looking forward to seeing Nina again. And of course, I’m excited to find out what Elliot’s planning for me to write next.”

“Will it be another trip abroad?” Bryn asked.

“I doubt it,” Keira replied. “Although I could certainly do with some sun!” She laughed and cast her gaze out the window at New York City’s gray October clouds.

“And your own bed again,” Bryn joked, patting the couch.

“About that…” Keira began. “You know I’m not planning on being here forever. It’s just taking a little longer than I thought it would to find an apartment. And I kind of need the deposit back from the place with Zach before I can. You know how much he’s been dragging his feet.”

“It’s fine,” Bryn said, waving away Keira’s explanation. “Stay as long as you need. Just don’t judge me for the men I bring home.” She gave Keira a withering look. “I’ve seen the way you look at me sometimes.”

Keira laughed. “I just think if you could really see how beautiful you are you wouldn’t waste so much time with ugly men.”

Bryn rolled her eyes. “Enough of that. So, why don’t you think you’ll be going abroad again?”

“I don’t know.” Keira shrugged. “Because it wouldn’t be fair to the other writers, for starters. It would look like favoritism.”

“Don’t forget you’re in a senior position now,” Bryn told her. “And favoritism is a very schoolyard word to use. It’s business. If you’re better than the others, you’re better than the others. Learn to accept it.”

Keira didn’t share her sister’s confidence. She squirmed uneasily. “Well anyway, even if it was abroad I wouldn’t be able to go.” She thought of Shane and smiled dreamily. “I have plans here.”

“Ah yes,” Bryn said, smirking. “The

boyfriend

. How long until he arrives?”

Keira’s mind conjured up the image of Shane’s gorgeous face—the stubble on his chiseled jaw, those amazing Irish blue eyes—and flitted through a myriad of wonderful memories from the month they’d spent falling in love.

“A week,” she said through a dreamy exhalation, thinking of the sensation of his lips on hers, the touch of his fingers against her skin. “Which reminds me, I should call him.”

It would be approaching midnight in Ireland where Shane lived, and so it would be her last chance to speak to him before he went to bed. Then she’d have to endure an eight-hour-long Shane absence while he was sleeping. No texts, no cheeky messages or funny quips. Those eight hours were almost unbearable for her at the moment, so strong was her craving for him.

“You call him every morning?” Bryn asked, surprised.

Keira picked up the hint of disdain in her sister’s voice. She was a perpetual singleton and serial dater, which made her suspicious of anyone who claimed to have found love.

“Yup,” Keira replied. “You’re usually snoring so you don’t notice.”

“Well, I think that’s unhealthy,” Bryn began. “You’re already too reliant on him.”

Keira rolled her eyes as she stood. Bryn liked nothing more than to be a know-it-all, despite being a rather dismal role model. And if she only knew, Kyra thought, if she could only witness what she and Shane had together, she wouldn’t be so sure of herself.

Keira took her phone into the bathroom, knowing it would be the only place where she could get any privacy in Bryn’s pokey apartment, then dialed Shane’s number. The usual thrill of excitement ran through her body as she waited, listening to the dial tone, in anticipation of hearing Shane’s beautiful voice again. She couldn’t wait to tell him about all the exciting things she had planned for his visit, all the sights of New York she was planning on showing him, from sampling food along Restaurant Row to river walks in Tribeca, the Tenement Museum, the gardens in Battery Park, the apple farm upstate and art galleries in Chelsea. Her itinerary was packed to the brim and she knew Shane would be just as excited to experience the city as she was to show it off.

Finally the call connected and Keira felt her heart soar. But rather than his usual chirpy voice, Shane sounded strained. And rather than answering the call with a silly over-the-top pet name like bunny or petal, he used her actual name.

“Keira, hey,” he said, sounding weary, like he’d had the worst day imaginable.

Keira’s elation immediately turned to anguish. In the background she could hear unfamiliar noises, lots of conversations, and ringing telephones.

“What’s happened?” she asked, starting to feel panicked. “Where are you?”

“Hospital.”

“Oh my God, why?” Keira’s heart began to race with terror, her mind going into overdrive. “Are you hurt? Sick?”

“It’s not me,” Shane said. “I’m fine. It’s my dad.”

Keira brought a picture of Shane’s father, Calum Lawder, to the forefront of her mind. He was one of the kindest, sweetest people she’d ever had the privilege of meeting. To think something had happened to him was awful.

“Is he okay? Tell me what’s going on.”

Shane sighed deeply. “He’ll be fine now they’ve operated.”

Keira felt her bones turn to ice. “

Operated?”

she cried.

“I’ve been in Accident and Emergency all day. He had a heart attack. They had to put a stent in. It’s a miracle he’s alive. If it hadn’t have been for the fact there was a heart surgeon in the hospital this morning for a scheduled appointment he wouldn’t have made it.”

“Oh, Shane, I’m so sorry,” Keira replied, feeling her chest clenching with anguish. She wished she could reach inside the phone and pluck Shane through it, smother him in care and affection. “How is your mom? Your sisters?”

“We’re okay,” Shane replied. “Still all in shock, to be honest. Especially Hannah.”

Keira thought of Shane’s youngest sister, the golden-haired sixteen-year-old she’d bonded with in particular. “Poor kid,” she replied. Suddenly now didn’t seem like the time to discuss Shane’s upcoming visit. It didn’t feel right to talk about all their exciting plans after the scare Shane had just experienced. “How is Calum now?”

“He’s awake and joking around, but I can tell he’s just trying to put on a brave face for the rest of us.”

“I’m so sorry, babe,” Keira said. “I wish I could be with you to support you, but I guess I’ll just have to store up all my hugs for the next week until you arrive.”

On the other end of the phone, Shane was silent. All Keira could hear were the ringing telephones of the busy hospital, bleeping machines, the faint sound of sirens, and the general hustle and bustle of medical staff completing their duties.

“It sounds chaotic there,” she added when Shane still remained mute.

“Keira,” he said, cutting off the end of her sentence.

Keira didn’t like the sound of his tone. She got the distinct impression that Shane was about to break bad news.

“What…?” she asked, drawing the sound of the word out like it was a wince.

“I’m going to have to cancel the trip,” Shane stated.

Keira could tell he was devastated just by the sound of his voice. Her own voice dropped into a pained whisper. “Really?”

“I’m sorry,” Shane responded. “But I have to be here. For Mum and the girls. They’re in pieces right now. I would feel like a jerk if I swanned off to New York City and left them all.”

“But it’s not for a week,” Keira replied. “Won’t things have calmed down by then? Calum will be back on his feet. And you won’t be away for that long anyway. Only a week. It’s not like you’re staying for a month or anything crazy like that. They’ll be fine without you for a few days. I mean, they cope without you once a year when you’re doing your tour guide thing in Lisdoonvarna.”

She could tell she was rambling now, and coming across as more than a little desperate. But she’d been so looking forward to seeing Shane again, to bringing him into her world like he’d had the chance to do for her in his. Waiting was so difficult, the absence so painful to endure. Not to mention all the money she’d put toward his flights, everything she’d splurged on—all those prebooked activities that didn’t have cancellation policies. She could have used her bonus from Elliot toward her accommodations instead of staying on Bryn’s couch ruining her back. Could she even afford to reschedule the trip? It wasn’t like Shane had much money that he could contribute.

“My dad almost died, Keira,” Shane told her bluntly. “It’s not the same thing as me spending a month away from home once a year.”

“I know,” she said, meekly. “I don’t mean to be selfish. It’s just that I miss you so much.”

“I miss you too,” Shane replied, sighing deeply.

Keira’s throat felt thick with unhappiness. But she didn’t want to dwell, especially when it hadn’t been

her

relative in the ER. She made the decision to brighten up.

“I suppose there’s nothing to be done,” she said, sounding calmer than she really felt. “Let’s just sort out a date now so we don’t leave the trip in limbo. I don’t know how well I’ll cope not being able to count down the days.” She chuckled, trying to give the impression that she was way more okay than she really felt.

Once again, there was no reply from Shane. In the space where his voice should be, Keira could instead only hear the sound of a receptionist giving someone directions to the kidney dialysis ward.

“Shane?” she asked, timidly, when she’d had just about enough of the silence as she could stand.

Finally he spoke.

“I don’t think I can book another date,” Shane told her.

“Because of your dad? Shane, he’ll be better before you know it. Back on his feet, back to running the farm. I promise you, by November everything will be back to normal. Or if you prefer we could aim for December. That gives him ages to get back to work.”

“Keira,” Shane interrupted.

She snapped her lips shut, stopping the stream of consciousness that she knew she was engaging in as an avoidance tactic, to delay what she feared was coming next, a way of pausing the terrible inevitability of what Shane was about to say.

“I can’t come,” he stated. “Ever.”

Keira felt her hands begin to shake. Her phone felt suddenly clammy in her hand, like she didn’t have a proper grip on it.

“Then I’ll come to Ireland,” she said, meekly. “I don’t mind being the one to travel if you don’t feel able to. I loved Ireland. I can come to you again.”

“That’s not what I mean.”

Keira knew what he meant, but she didn’t want to believe it. She wasn’t about to let Shane give up at the first hurdle. Their love was greater than that, more important and special. She’d have to convince him otherwise, even if it meant sounding desperate or becoming, in Bryn’s words, too reliant.

She listened to the sound of Shane take a deep, sad inhalation. “I’m needed on the farm, with my family. Ireland is my home. I can’t move anywhere else.”

“No one’s talking about moving,” Keira replied.

“But we will be, soon enough,” Shane said. “If we want our relationship to work, at some point we’re going to have to live in the same country. I can’t move there. You won’t move here.”

“I could,” Keira stammered. “I’m sure I could. At some point.”

She thought of the beautiful country she’d fallen in love with. She could certainly live there if it was necessary to be with Shane.

“On a farm?”

“Sure!”

The cute farmhouse filled with love and family was a wonderful draw for Keira. Her own family was fragmented, with Bryn always busy, her mom living miles away, and her father completely absent from her life. What wasn’t there to love about the instant family Shane could provide her with?

“With my family? My sisters? My parents?” Shane questioned her. “And all those sheep?”

Keira remembered the sheep dung she’d found herself knee deep in. She thought of Shane’s six sisters, who were all lovely but all still living at home. It would be a squeeze. Hardly the life she’d expected for herself. But neither was sleeping on Bryn’s couch. If she could put up with living with her own sister then she could definitely put up with living with all six of Shane’s! And wasn’t life supposed to be about overcoming the challenges it threw at you? Wasn’t it about embracing the crazy?

“Shane,” Keira replied, trying to sound soothing. “We don’t need to work this stuff out right now. Life changes. Who knows, all your sisters might get married and move out. Your parents might decide to sell the farm and sail around the world on a yacht. You can’t predict the future so let’s just stop worrying about it.”

“Please listen,” Shane replied, his voice cracking with emotion. “I’m trying to end it now so that it doesn’t become even more painful than it already is, later down the road.”

The word

end

repeated in Keira’s mind, like a hammer on steel. She winced, the painful lump in her throat growing even bigger and harder than it already was.

It dawned on her then for the first time that Shane’s mind was made up. He wasn’t backing down. Nothing she said would change his mind.

“Don’t do this,” Keira replied. Suddenly she was crying, sobbing loudly, uncontrollably, as it finally sunk in that Shane wasn’t going to back down. That he really was breaking up with her. Her One. The love of her life.

“I’m sorry,” he replied, crying too. “I have to. Please understand. If we didn’t have this ocean between us I would want to be with you all the time. I may even want to marry you.”

“Don’t say that!” Keira wailed. “You’re just making it worse.”

Shane exhaled loudly. “I need you to know how much you mean to me, Keira. I don’t want you to think that I just got cold feet or something. If we weren’t at this impasse I wouldn’t be doing it at all. It’s not what I want. Not even slightly. Do you understand?”

“Yes,” Keira replied, her tears falling bitterly from her eyes. She understood loud and clear. The man of her dreams, a man who loved her and made her laugh every single day, was giving up on her just because things were a little complicated. The man she’d fallen so deeply in love with during the most transformative month of her life was giving up at the first hurdle. He wasn’t going to put the hard work into their relationship after all. The thoughts swirled bitterly in Keira’s mind.

“So I guess this is goodbye?” she said, coolly.

Shane must have picked up on her sudden dejected tone. “Don’t be like that,” he said. “We can stay in touch. We can be friends. There’s always social media. It’s not like I’m cutting you out of my life entirely.”

“Of course,” Keira replied, heavyhearted, knowing that even with the best of intentions, once-loving relationships rarely if ever successfully turned into platonic friendships. It just didn’t work that way. Once love was lost, it was gone, at least in Keira’s experience.

“Are you mad at me?” Shane asked, his voice sounding small and fragile.

“No,” Keira replied, realizing it to be true. Shane’s reasons for ending it were noble. He was putting his family first. They were exactly the type of qualities she needed from a partner, so it would be a bit unfair of her to begrudge him it. “I think you should go and be with your family now,” she added. “Give everyone a hug from me, will you?”

“Okay,” Shane replied.

Keira wasn’t sure, but she got the distinct impression from the way he said it that he knew she wasn’t expecting to ever speak to him again. He sounded crushed.

There was a long moment of silence.

“Goodbye, Keira,” Shane said finally.

Before she had a chance to reply, the call went dead. She removed her phone from her ear and stared at it in her hand. How could such a small chunk of metal and computer chips cause her to feel like the entire world had fallen away beneath her feet? How could one conversation turn her life upside down? She felt like every ounce of happiness she’d ever felt had been sucked through the phone’s speakers and spat out into some black abyss, never to be seen again.

And worst of all, Keira couldn’t even be angry. Shane hadn’t been a jerk like every other boyfriend she’d broken up with had. There was no cheating, no lying, no screaming matches or deliberate below the belt punches. Perhaps that was why it hurt so much more. Perhaps it was because she’d let herself get carried away thinking Shane could be the One, that anyone could be the One.

Her tears still falling, Keira left the bathroom and threw her phone onto the couch. Bryn, who was standing at the breakfast bar brewing coffee, flinched with surprise.

“What’s wrong?” Bryn asked. “Are you crying?”

Ignoring Bryn’s questioning, Keira grabbed her fall itinerary off the side table—glancing briefly at the list of events she’d planned for her and Shane, places where they were supposed to make precious memories to tell the grandchildren—and ripped it clean in half.

# Chapter 2

CHAPTER TWO

Bryn scooped her arm around Keira’s shoulder as the younger of the two sisters wept bitterly.

“You’ve done the right thing,” Bryn soothed. “I know it won’t seem that way right now, but trust me. You were getting in way too deep. You’re twenty-eight, Keira, it’s not time to settle down.”

Her words did little to comfort Keira. Who exactly was Bryn to talk? Her life had been a series of disastrous relationships. She had no idea what kind of love Keira and Shane had found, and now lost. Sobs made her whole body shake.

“Come on,” Bryn added, “Let’s go get a coffee. I’ll call Mom. You know how great she is with all this stuff.”

Keira couldn’t disagree more. Her mom, unlike Bryn, seemed to be in a rush to get her to settle down and have babies. She’d gone so far as to say that there was little point in Keira putting so much energy into her career when she’d be giving it all up in a couple of years anyway to have kids.

She shook her head. “I can’t, I have to get to work.”

Bryn pulled a face. “Babe, you are a wreck. They won’t want you there in this state. You’re no good to anyone.”

“Thanks,” Keira muttered. “But I can’t not go in. First day back after a break. New senior position. Elliot’s going to be in the office. He’ll be expecting me to step up my game.”

While she was speaking, Bryn reached over and plucked Keira’s phone from her hands.

“Hey!” Keira protested.

Bryn tapped some buttons and then triumphantly placed the cell on the coffee table. “Done.”

“What?” Keira cried, horrified, snatching it up. “Did you just request a sick day for me? I’ve never taken a sick day! You’re so unprofessional. I can’t believe you’d do that.”

But when she scrolled through the most recent actions on her phone, she saw that it wasn’t work whom Bryn had contacted, but instead Nina, Keira’s friend and editor at the magazine. She read through the message that Bryn had sent her.

Shane dumped me. My life is over. Help.

Keira rolled her eyes, unimpressed, and fixed a death-glare at her sister. Bryn just shrugged cheekily. A second later, Keira’s phone buzzed with an incoming message from Nina.

It’s going to be okay. I’ll tell Elliot we’re having a meeting outside the office. Coffee in ten?

Keira’s expression softened. Maybe Bryn had some uses after all.

“Nina’s going to come and meet me,” she said, stowing the phone away. “Happy now?”

“Yes,” Bryn replied. “Now I just have to quickly tell my boss I’m not coming in today.”

“You don’t have to do that.”

“Oh please, any excuse,” Bryn said.

Keira gave in. There was no arguing with Bryn sometimes. Even though her sister wasn’t always the most comforting shoulder to cry on, she was good at putting herself first and that practice occasionally worked in Keira’s favor.

Several minutes later, the sisters left the apartment together, wrapped in their warmer fall clothes, and headed down the street to the coffee shop they’d agreed to meet Nina in. It was still very early. When they arrived, the coffee shop had only just opened up for the day. They were the first inside.

Bryn ordered flat whites and skinny muffins for them both and led Keira to the squishy leather couch. A moment later, Nina walked in.

“Keira,” she said, her expression pained.

She sat down and hugged Keira tightly, which made her feel instantly comforted. Maybe skipping work had been a good idea after all, though she reminded herself not to make a habit of it. It was beyond unprofessional, even if Bryn and Nina didn’t seem to think so. Keira probably didn’t have too much to worry about; she was on the verge of committing herself to a life of celibacy anyway so there was very little chance of her taking a heartbreak day ever again...

“God, I can’t believe Shane has been such a jerk,” Nina began.

Keira shook her head. “It’s not like that.”

Nina shot her a deadpan expression. “How is it not like that? He manipulated you into thinking you’d fallen in love with him and then a week before you’re supposed to reunite he dumps you?”

“Well, if you put it like that,” Keira said. “But trust me, that’s not what happened. His dad got sick. It made him, I don’t know, reevaluate things.” She felt tears threatening to choke her again. “But can we please not do this? I don’t want to be put in a position where I have to defend the guy who’s just broken my heart.”

Nina paused, seemingly deliberating over her request. “Maybe this is all for the best,” she said. “Elliot will probably be sending you abroad for a new assignment soon anyway. Maybe you’ll meet a new guy. An ever better guy.”

“That’s the last thing I want right now,” Keira replied glumly, sinking her chin onto her fist. “I don’t know how much more my heart can handle. Straight from Zach to Shane to someone else who’ll just treat me like crap? I don’t think so. I was right before to put all my focus on my career. It’s not like my job will tell me that if things were different it might have married me.”

Nina winced. “Shane said that?”

Keira nodded, feeling sadder and more dejected than ever.

Nina gave her another squeeze around the shoulders. “You’re young. Too young to settle. There’s a big world out there and you’ve only seen a fraction of it.”

“Thank you,” Bryn agreed. “That’s what I’ve been telling her. She’s still in her twenties, for God’s sake. Wait until you hit three-oh at least.”

Nina raised an eyebrow. “Make that four-oh,” she said, witheringly. “Plus a few more for luck. I’m in no hurry to settle down. Despite what the media might be telling me about my biological clock.”

“The media?” Keira quipped. “You mean like us? We are journalists after all. It’s our job to make people think they want things. Like love,” she added bitterly.

Nina laughed and Keira felt a little better. She glanced out the window at the busy New York City streets, filled with people on their way to work, people on their way home from all-night raves, people dressed in expensive suits, others in witty slogan T-shirts. She could see so many races and nationalities, and every conceivable hairstyle. They hurried along, battling against the cold winds that fall had brought in.

As she studied them, Keira realized just how much she loved her city. She’d never have been happy living in Ireland. Shane had been right about that. Moving away just wasn’t an option for her. She was New York through and through. The city practically ran through her blood.

She turned her attention back to Nina and Bryn.

“So, how did Elliot take my absence from the office today?” she asked Nina, more than ready to change the topic of conversation.

Nina stirred her coffee. “Honestly, he seems a little distracted today. I overheard him having a heated conversation on the phone the other night when I was working late. I think there might be someone trying to buy out the magazine.”

Keira raised her eyebrows in surprise. “That wouldn’t happen, though. Elliot wouldn’t sell. He loves

Viatorum

. Too much sometimes.”

Nina just shrugged and took a sip of her coffee. “Sometimes it’s not about how much you love something. If one of the big companies is going to start up a rival magazine, copy our model but use all their financial assets and connections to push themselves and bury us, he won’t have any other option but to sell. Sometimes the only way an independent like

Viatorum

can stay viable is for the boss like Elliot to make compromises over ownership.”

“But it would be like taking a demotion for him, wouldn’t it?” Keira asked. “He’d go from owning it outright to just, what, managing it?”

Nina tilted her head to the side. “It’s not all bad. He could make more money this way. He’d just have higher-ups to answer to. He’d probably lose some creative freedom.” She shrugged again. “Actually, he’d definitely lose some creative freedom.”

Keira chewed her lip, considering Nina’s premonition. Why did things always have to change so quickly? This morning she’d woken up with a loving partner and an awesome job. Now she was sitting tear-stained and depressed in a coffee shop, back on the market and worrying about her employment situation.

“Well, that’s one way to take my mind off Shane,” Keira said wryly to Nina.

“Oh God, sorry,” Nina said. “I didn’t mean to worry you. I’m sure nothing will change for you, or me, or anyone else for that matter. Just Elliot really. I’ve been through buy-outs before, countless times, in fact. It’s usually pretty unnoticeable for most of the staff.”

Keira pursed her lips. “We’ll see,” she replied.

Nina looked a little panicked, Keira thought, and she watched as her friend made eye contact with Bryn as if trying to prompt her to take over. Bryn suddenly lit up as though she’d been struck with a thought.

“I have an amazing idea,” she said, her eyes widening.

“Why do I get the feeling I am not going to like this one bit?” Keira replied, narrowing her own.

“There’s this awesome party thing at Gino’s tonight, you know, that authentic Italian restaurant in the city,” Bryn said. “It’s Halloween themed. Actually, it’s All Souls’ Day themed, which is an Italian holiday I’ve never heard of but it sounds super creepy and they’re taking it really seriously at Gino’s. It’s going to be half masquerade ball, half gothic meal. It sounds crazy but in a super cool way.”

Keira squinted her eyes further. Bryn was blabbering. “Go on…” she urged her sister.

“Here’s the thing,” Bryn said. “I was invited there for a date by this guy I met the other night, Malcolm. He wanted to see what it was all about, you know, something different to try. I obviously said sure, you know me, I’ll try anything once. Anyway, so he mentioned today that he has a friend who’s single and wondered if I knew anyone to double date with. I was going to invite Tasha, but why don’t you and I go instead? Now you’re back on the market.”

Keira didn’t even need a second to consider Bryn’s proposition. She shook her head with an emphatic no. “Absolutely not,” she said.

Nina leaned forward, seemingly on board. “I know this amazing costume store,” she said. “You could get a full-on ball gown, gloves, mask, the lot.”

Keira shot her a withering glance. “Why don’t you go on the double date if you’re so into the idea?”

Nina closed her mouth. Bryn took over as lead cajoler again.

“Just come for the food at least,” Bryn said. “Free meal. Fancy food. Dancing. Just think of it as a night out for the two of us, with just a couple of guys tagging along footing the bill. You don’t even have to tell them your real name if you don’t want to, or even take off your mask. It could be a night of anonymity. You could invent a whole new persona.”

Keira laughed. “Let me guess, you’ve done that before?”

Nina jumped in then. “Please, darling, everyone’s done that before. If you haven’t been on a date and pretended you work for the FBI or that you’re an heir to a billion-dollar inheritance then you haven’t really lived.”

Shaking her head, Keira glanced out the window again. She looked at the people milling through the streets. Some of the stores already had Halloween decorations in their windows. She spotted a goth couple walking down the street—the woman in a black lace dress carrying a parasol, the man on a leather lead. Only in New York City, she thought to herself, amused.

Life was supposed to be about embracing the crazy, she reminded herself. Hadn’t she told herself that exact thing just this morning?

“Fine,” she said, turning back to Bryn with a sigh of resignation. “I’ll come to your ball.”



Bryn was right about one thing, Keira discovered later that evening; Gino’s looked amazing. The whole restaurant had been decorated to look like a gothic castle, the tables pushed to the perimeter so that the middle part was a dance floor. There was an incredibly creepy vibe, with old Italian folk music, waiters in velvet suits, and of course, everyone in masquerade masks.

If it had just been the two of them, Keira would have had a great night. But unfortunately, they were sharing their evening with Malcolm, Bryn’s date, and Glen, Keira’s date. They must have been two of the most boring men in the world.

Keira forked her pasta, barely able to keep herself awake, as Glen explained more details about his career in accounting. Work chat annoyed Keira at the best of times, but when it involved math the boringness was stepped up another notch. Not to mention he hadn’t actually asked her a single question about

her

job.

There was a sudden lull in the conversation and Keira sat up as though startled awake.

“So, what do you do in your spare time?” she asked Glen, desperate to steer the conversation elsewhere.

Glen took a long time to answer, another thing Keira took as a bad sign. Who didn’t know what hobbies they had? Or what they enjoyed doing other than their jobs?

“I watch sports,” he said, finally.

“Watch,” Keira repeated. “Not play?”

Glen laughed. “Hell no. I don’t want an injury. I prefer to be a spectator.”

“That’s…” Keira struggled for a word. The one she landed on was probably the opposite of what she meant. “...interesting.”

“What about you?” Glen asked.

It was the first time he’d asked her about herself, and Keira was almost surprised. “Oh, well, I’m in journalism so I spend a lot of my spare time reading,” she began.

Glen cut her off immediately. “I read, too. The

Wall Street Journal

mainly.”

Realizing her time to speak had been snatched from her, Keira felt her chest sink. She prodded her pasta again. “Cool.”

Bryn leaned across the table then. “We were just talking about plans,” she said. “What we want to achieve in five years. Keira, what about you?”

If Bryn had asked her yesterday Keira would have been certain that what she wanted in the next five years was to spend as much time as possible with Shane. Buy their dream house together. Maybe even marry and have some kids. But that dream was dashed now.

Keira just shrugged. “I’d like to travel. See the world. In five years’ time I want to have set foot on every continent at least once.”

Bryn clapped. “That’s a great one, sis.”

Glen scoffed. “Traveling is so overrated these days, now that we have the technology to map everything. I mean why spend hours in an aluminum tube flying through the sky, polluting the atmosphere, when you can see the world from the comfort of your own home? Virtual reality is in its infancy at the moment, but within five years it’s going to take off. A fifty-dollar headset will take the place of hundreds of dollars wasted on flights.”

Only Malcolm nodded in agreement, his expression revealing that he found Glen’s point to be thought provoking. Bryn, on the other hand, looked horrified by his statement and she flashed Keira a look of apology. Keira just gave her sister a deadpan look, as if to say

I said this would be terrible.

“What about you then, Glen?” Bryn asked, floundering to save the conversation. “If you’re not a fan of traveling, what do you think your next five years will look like?”

Everyone turned their attention to the accountant. He cracked his knuckles.

“I’ve got it all planned out,” he said confidently. He pointed at his index finger. “A wife in a year.” Then he moved onto his next finger. “Our dream family home in the suburbs the year after that.” He pointed at the next two fingers. “Two kids, eighteen months apart. One boy, one girl.” Then finally he wiggled his thumb. “And a dog.”

Keira sighed deeply. She’d known before she’d even left Bryn’s apartment that she wasn’t going to find anything resembling romance on this date. But there’d still been a flicker of hope. Just a little spark that someone who burned as brightly as Shane might appear in her life out of the blue, turning her world upside down just as quickly as Shane himself had done.

But she realized now, with bitter disappointment, that she’d been a fool to even entertain that idea. Shane was a one in a million experience. No, one in a billion. Her date with Glen had just confirmed her worst fears.

She’d never find a love like that again.",1,1747686642.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1kqmabq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1kqmabq/author_fair_ideas/,Author Fair Ideas,"Hello! 

I am a librarian at a public library. For the last 4 years I have been in charge of the committee for our annual local author fair. While the event is decently attended and I have received few complaints, I am still not quite satisfied with it.  

I just want to know if anyone else runs an author fair at their library and how it works for you?   
  
How many authors do you invite and do you invite them or do they come to you?   
  
Is it just authors or are other groups involved?   
  
How do you get patrons in the door?    
  
Do you have other activities going on that aren't authors selling books? (live music, food trucks, etc...)   
  
Any information or ideas would be appreciated.   
  
\--We usually host around 30 authors that have either emailed me directly or that I have emailed to invite. Authors do not pay a table fee and we provide refreshments from local businesses.   
  
\--We have mostly just authors, but also our local genealogical society will sometimes have a booth with books they have published.   
  
\--We do a drawing with prizes donated by our local friends groups. The big Prize is a Kindle E-reader, and the other prizes are gift cards to various local businesses. We also hold the event during a big antiquing event at the venue across the street from us to drum up more business.   
  
\--We do not have other activities. We have kicked around the idea of live music and a coffee cart, but we didn't want to take away from the focus on the authors. ",1,1747686547.0,Libraries,2,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

How do I fix this?","Back in March I had an anxiety/panic attack after I accidentally ate a little mold which caused me to have an anxiety/panic attack that lasted a couple of hours. It happened late at night and I was pretty pissed off at myself afterwards and moved on, but then they came back every so often. The first attack in March gave me a sense of shortness of breath, thirstiness, dizziness, nausea, and sense of impending doom. Then, a week or so after, I had another anxiety/panic attack after drinking coffee with caffeine which caused shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, and temperature changes (mostly chills). Eventually, I told myself this was all nonsense and I started to ignore these attacks so over time they became manageable. However, this morning my nose bled a little bit due to dry air and I had the worst panic attack of my life when I got on my school bus (I'm a high school senior). First I had shortness of breath, then I had a sensation like I was going to pass out, die, or both, then I felt like I had to vomit, then I had a terrible headache, then I had a hot flash and after that it was just chills. I also had dizziness, nausea, anxiety and even a little shortness of breath. NEVER before have I had these ridiculous attacks, and I want them GONE! I've been avoiding coffee but clearly that still isn't good enough because they STILL find ways to attack me. How do I get rid of these ridiculous attacks? Please help me out with this, thanks!

He ended things with her quickly after that and called me telling me he wants to forget about me forever and quoting me a dumbass thing .. “if youre in a forest and you see the same tree two times it means you’re really lost” or sm like that.. i stopped talking to him completely but he continued to make fun of me at school . Two weeks ago , a common friend of ours invited us both to coffee and we both went and met up there . it was honestly normal . he didnt say anything rude to me but he alao didnt try to make a move on me. then that mutual friend created a groupchat where we started calling (me and my ex) every night until 6 am next morning . progressively, each night he started to tell me he misses and loves me and that he changed .. and i .. as a fool .. believed him and had hope in him . now .. heres the catch
two days ago , all 3 of us met up at my exs apartament . my common friend ( which i explicitly told i dont want nothing to happen physically bwtween me and my ex) left to go “grab some money from his apartment” (they live 3 min away from each other) . during the time our friend was gone , my ex made several moves on me and tried to make out with me several times .. he started to play with my bra and tank top straps .. grab my waist .. my ass etc . i tried to get away but then i dont even know what the fuck i was thinking and i just gave up and kissed him .. then made out with him . fortunately.. i didnt do anything more . after our friend came back , my ex sat on the sofa and started to ignore the both of us and talk to two other girls and then started to ask me when im leaving . i just left snd since then he hasnt bothered calling me or anything. he just called on the groupchat today but i didnt respond and thats it. 
i dont know why he keeps contacting me 
i dont know why i keep abandoning everything in my life the moment he says he wants to see or talk to me
i dont know why i cant be strong
and i dont know what his intentions really are . i really thought a person who just wants to use another wouldnt waste 7 nights and not sleep just to talk with that other person.
i crave him so badly in my life but i know he only sees me as a dumb bitch who will always come back to him .. or maybe he really misses me.
i need help . its consuming me . without him im happy .. but he is like a drug . when i talk to him or see him i feel a type of indescribable happiness .. like an euphoria .. but once its over i feel so guilty and its consuming me .

**PART 1**

Cut up zyns (snus) and cover this in ethanol+IPA (surface disinfectant, pure ethanol is illegal here). Filter this through coffee paper and let solution evaporate leaving nicotine and whatever other flavouring products.

**PART 2**

For the first time in years I've been consistently going to the gym. Right now, my MAIN goal is to lose body fat (currently 5'11, and weigh about 270 pounds), but I'm also trying to just build muscle and get stronger.

I'm interested in taking preworkout. I've taken C4 a few times now but it doesn't seem to do much for me at all. I'm looking for something a little stronger, but there are so many options that it seems overwhelming. There are also some that have the same amount of caffeine as like 3-6 cups of coffee, and that just seems crazy, but again, I'm new to the pre workout thing so maybe that's normal?

I'm also interested in taking creatine. I know a lot of pre workouts have some creatine, but usually not enough to reach most peoples goals. I think it's recommended to take 5g of creatine per day and many pre workouts have less than that.

So I guess I'm asking for recommendations as well as experience here. Does anyone take BOTH pre workout and creatine, and if so, what do you take? How does it affect you? Thanks in advance.",1,1747686229.0,Supplements,3,1.0,False
1kqm5aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/1kqm5aj/a_little_confusion_on_disjunctive_necessary/,A little confusion on disjunctive necessary conditions,"This comes after I finished a very convoluted question about sentient beings on other planets being able to communicate with humans today. In short my question is, let’s say we diagrammed a conditional as: 

If I go to the store THEN I buy eggs or coffee

The contra positive is /eggs and /coffee THEN /store 

What I don’t get is, is 

“Eggs or coffee” equivalent to IF /eggs then coffee, and IF /coffee then eggs? 

Because if so, I don’t understand why in this question where you get it down to: 

IF we can determine there are sentient beings THEN we can reach them by space ship or they can communicate with us, 

We can’t then automatically conclude “because we can’t reach them by spaceship, they can communicate with us.” Instead, the correct answer choice prompts you to choose something limiting the universe to just Spaceship and the sentient beings communicating with us. I thought the universe would already be limited to those two options if you have IF A then B or C. 

I get that you could have a disjunctive sufficient condition like IF dog or Cat then Mammal, and that doesn’t preclude “whale” also being sufficient for mammal, but I’m struggling to conceptualize why that same logic would apply to a disjunctive necessary condition. By contraposing, I thought you got /a and /b then /c. So even if there was some d term (aka an alternate explanation, since /a and /b are present, /c would logically still follow. 


It could very well be I’m diagramming the original question wrong and/or misunderstanding something. This is just very confusing to me, and if anyone has an explanation it would be highly appreciated ",1,1747686227.0,LSAT,3,1.0,False

1kqm1ye,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1kqm1ye/hey_anybody_know_the_title_or_link/,"Hey, anybody know the title or link","I thought my husband was broke. For three years, I paid for everything—rent, groceries, even his morning coffee.

Once, while we were out shopping, I saw a $20 purse I liked. He took one look and said it was too expensive.

Then one day, by sheer accident, I found out he bought his first love a $4 million diamond necklace—for her birthday.

Turns out, he wasn't drowning in debt like he led me to believe. He was actually the heir to a billion-dollar empire.

...

I got home late after a long shift, took a quick shower, and collapsed onto my bed. I was scrolling through my phone when a notification popped up that made my heart stop.

""Popular actress Isabella Montgomery receives a $4 million diamond necklace from a mysterious tycoon for her birthday.""

My hands trembled as I zoomed in on the photo.

You couldn't see his face, just his back, but after three years of marriage, I'd know him anywhere. The dark mole behind his ear gave him away.

It was Ethan. My husband.

Four million dollars. I couldn't even wrap my head around that kind of money.

Just a few days ago, we were out shopping when I spotted a $200 handbag I really liked. Ethan immediately said it was too expensive and gently talked me out of buying it.

I did the math, $200 could buy a ton of tissues or last us weeks in groceries. So I let it go.

Now, I could barely breathe.

Ethan and I met online.

After chatting for a couple of months, we met up, hit it off instantly, and fell hard. On Valentine's Day, he got down on one knee with a soda can tab fashioned into a ring and said he'd buy me a real diamond once he made it big.

I said yes. Not for the diamond, because I loved him.

He told me he was an orphan, raised in a group home. He'd tried starting a business, but it failed, leaving him over a million dollars in debt. So we kept our wedding simple.

We rented a tiny apartment, and I paid the bills. I also covered most of our day-to-day expenses.

To make ends meet, I worked full-time during the day and picked up night shifts waiting tables.

His entire salary went toward clearing his debt.

I remember him once pulling me into his arms and whispering, ""Thank you for giving me a home, Audrey. I've never been this happy.""

He cried as he said, ""Once I pay everything off, I'll buy you a house, a car... I'll give you the life you deserve. I'm so sorry you have to suffer with me.""

I kissed him and told him, ""As long as we're together, I'm already happy.""

I meant every word. Back then, I thought I was the luckiest woman alive.

Ethan was handsome, kind, didn't smoke or drink, and treated me like I was his whole world. Aside from being broke, he was perfect.

I thought if we both kept grinding, we'd get through this.

But now? Now I couldn't stop crying.

Then, right on cue, a text from Ethan lit up my screen.

""Business is good tonight, Audrey. I'm staying out late to make more for the debt. Don't wait up, get some rest.""

He worked as a courier during the day and sometimes picked up gigs as a designated driver at night.

If I hadn't seen that photo, I would've believed every word.

So why was he lying?

I didn't sleep a wink. Ethan never came home.

The next morning, I got ready in a daze and stepped outside. Just as I was about to leave, I froze.

Across the street, I spotted someone I knew too well.

Ethan.

I ducked behind a tree, peeking out as he stepped out of a Bentley. Gone was the sleek suit from the night before, now he was back in the cheap T-shirt and jeans I'd bought him.

A middle-aged man handed him a plastic bag, steamed pork buns and soy milk.

My favorite breakfast.

Just then, another car pulled up. Out stepped the CEO of a big tech firm. My friend worked at his company.

He walked over to Ethan... and bowed slightly.

I blinked, stunned. That man had a reputation, he was powerful, ruthless, respected.

Why was he acting like a junior intern around my husband?

A minute later, Ethan called.

My screen lit up: ""Husband""

Tears blurred my vision. I took a breath and picked up.

""Hey, Audrey. I got you your favorite, steamed buns and soy milk.""

""I had to head in early today. You eat without me, okay?""

His voice sounded so normal. So warm.

""Alright,"" I said softly. ""I'll eat later.""

""I'll cook something nice when you get home,"" he added.

""Okay.""

I hung up and texted my boss to take the day off.

I wasn't going to work today.

I was going to find out who my husband really was.

I camped out at a coffee shop across the street, eyes fixed on our building.

Around noon, Ethan finally came out.

He got into the Bentley. I pulled on a mask and flagged down a taxi, tailing him from a distance.

We stopped at an upscale restaurant, white-glove service, valet parking, the works. The moment the car pulled up, the valet practically sprinted to open the door. Ethan tossed him the keys like he'd done it a hundred times.

I followed at a distance as he disappeared into a private dining room.

Inside, I could see a group of guys already seated, young, smug, dressed in expensive suits. The kind of people who were born into money.

I pretended to be on a call and lingered near the door.

They ordered big, lobster, king crab, Buddha Jumps Over the Wall. Dishes I'd only ever seen on YouTube.

Meanwhile, at home, Ethan refused to throw away leftovers and insisted we eat them two days in a row.

Laughter burst out from the private room.

""Ethan, you look hilarious in those cheap clothes. The heir to a fortune dressing like a broke college kid, classic!""

""How long are you gonna keep up this act? Don't tell me you're seriously into that country bumpkin wife of yours?""

Then Ethan's voice cut through:

""Please. Audrey's just a toy. Something to kill time. You think I'd fall for someone like her?""

""I told her I was a million in debt, and she actually believed it. She said she'd suffer with me to pay it off. God, she's the most gullible woman I've ever met.""

They all roared with laughter.

And in that moment... it felt like my heart had been ripped out and stomped on.

Bleeding. Broken. Unrecognizable.

Chapter 2
I thought I was his true love, but I was just his pawn.

Even our happy marriage had been nothing more than an illusion he'd carefully crafted.

Ethan Sinclair wasn't some orphan struggling to make ends meet. His story of going bankrupt and being deep in debt? A complete lie. His family was wealthy, influential.

And then I overheard voices from the private room.

""By the way, I heard Isabella was thrilled when she got the necklace you sent her last night. She even wants to get back with you. Don't you think she'd be heartbroken if she found out you're married?""

""Serves her right! She dumped Ethan to chase her acting career abroad.""

""None of you know the real reason Ethan married that country girl—it was for revenge against Isabella.""

My body froze, my breath catching in my throat.

He didn't love me. I had been nothing but a tool to hurt someone else.

I clutched my chest, feeling my heart crack open.

Isabella Montgomery—his first love. Back then, his parents had disapproved of her acting dreams, so she left him.

Afterward, Ethan decided all women were untrustworthy, so he made a game out of manipulating their emotions, dating one after the other. Finally, he settled on marriage—to get back at Isabella.

But afraid his wealth would attract the wrong type of woman, he hid his identity and chose someone plain and ordinary.

And I was the fool who fell for it.

Isabella was the one who had wronged him, not me. So why had he destroyed my dignity like this? Why had he trampled on my heart?

A suffocating wave of pain hit me. Just as I turned to leave, I heard another voice from inside the room.

""Mr. Sinclair, what if Audrey finds out the truth?""

Ethan's voice dripped with disdain. ""She's too busy working to support me. She doesn't have time to care about anything else. After work, she runs to the market to buy discounted groceries just to cook for me.""

""If she finds out? Doesn't matter. I'll make sure she signs the divorce papers—empty-handed.""

All the color drained from my face.

And then I saw her—Isabella, stunningly dressed and glowing, walking toward the private room. The moment she entered, the room lit up with compliments.

By pure chance, a waiter opened the door to serve the dishes, and I caught a glimpse of Isabella sitting next to Ethan, their gazes locked in an intimate exchange.

She touched the diamond necklace around her neck and smiled coyly. ""I love the necklace. Thank you, Ethan.""

His lips curled into a slight smile. ""As long as you like it.""

How generous he was with his first love—a four-million-dollar necklace, given without hesitation.

Yet, in his eyes, I wasn't even worth a two-hundred-dollar handbag.

I couldn't bear to hear any more. I stumbled out of the restaurant, nearly losing my footing on the steps.

Outside, the tears came—hot and fast, the sobs wracking my body as I finally let myself fall apart.

For three years, I had loved Ethan with everything I had.

I worried about him working too hard, so I'd made nourishing soups to keep him healthy.

I stuck to cheap skincare, saving every penny to buy him nice clothes and shoes—lying that I'd gotten them with online discounts.

And he'd praised me for being clever.

But the truth was, I had been a fool.

By the time I made it home, the night had fallen. Ethan was in the kitchen, cooking.

When he heard me enter, he looked up with that warm smile of his. ""Honey, you're back. Dinner's ready.""

There he was, wearing an apron in our tiny kitchen. It was hard to believe he was the heir to a billionaire fortune.

As he stirred the pan, he chirped, ""The fish was fresh today. The vendor even gave me a two-dollar discount.""

""Oh, and I sold all the cardboard boxes I'd saved up for two weeks—made sixty-eight bucks. After groceries, I still have five left.""

I closed my eyes, the pain in my chest almost too much to bear.

He'd gone to such great lengths to keep up this charade.

The table was set with four dishes and a soup. In the past, I would've rushed to him, calling him the best husband in the world.

But now? All I felt was bitterness.

I remembered what I'd overheard at the restaurant and clenched my fists. Ethan had learned to cook—for Isabella.

Yet, he'd told me he only started after marrying me.

He'd also claimed he grew up unloved, hungry, and bullied—that he wouldn't have survived without charity.

I had felt my heart break for him.

But none of it had been true. Not a word of it.

Not even when he said he loved me.

Tears started streaming down my face.

Ethan set down the dish and hurried over, concern filling his eyes. ""Honey, did something happen at work?""

When I didn't answer, his frown deepened. ""Talk to me. Who upset you? Seeing you cry like this breaks my heart.""

""Once I start making real money, you won't have to work anymore. Just stay home. I'll take care of you.""

He kept calling me ""honey,"" his handsome face filled with worry—as if he actually loved me.

Was he for real? Because all I could think was he was full of crap.

My lips trembled as I asked, ""Ethan, do you love me?""

He smiled tenderly. ""Of course I do. You're the woman I love most in this world.""

I stared into his eyes, thinking of every cruel word I'd overheard in the restaurant—each one a bullet to my heart.

He looked down on me. He saw me as nothing more than a stepping stone to get back at Isabella.

So when he said he loved me, all I felt was disgust.

I used to be friends with someone-let’s call them Suzy. Suzy and I were thick as thieves-super close-to the point everyone thought we were dating. We were this close for a long time-maybe 5-6 years, before the friendship ended. 

Essentially I started putting in the same effort I was given, and determined I was (and for a long time had been) treated as a friend of convenience by Suzy. So I stopped reaching out, and between moving and being adults even potential interactions became few and far between. The last time we really spoke was nearly a decade ago, so it’s been some time since the “fall out” with Suzy occurred

Over the years, she has minimally kept in touch with my friend Ryan-which on its own is totally fine, but Suzy would always ask about me in a weird way. Not just “hey have you heard how Joe is doing?” But like in a way that when Ryan and Suzy hooked up, she rolled over immediately after in bed and “sincerely” asked how I was. 

Now I get it-maybe there were some romantic feelings that didn’t get resolved but it would be weird things like this every year or so without any attempt to contact me

Flash forward to yesterday, and I get a text from Ryan about how Suzy wants him to ask me to meet for coffee because she has something to apologize for. I think it’s weird she asks him, but like 20 minutes later she texts me and asks herself. I politely decline and then I get a text back asking I can make time for a call. 

I need help avoiding being the asshole while declining. I don’t want to be an ass. I also genuinely have no interesting in reconnecting. I never felt like my life lost anything without Suzy in it, and am too old to be bringing people in who don’t add to it. And as far as an apology-it’s been almost 10 years. I don’t want or need one. It also feels like the apology is so Suzy can feel better about herself, compared to an apology being issued for truly feeling bad

I don’t want to be mean. I also won’t be reconnecting. Please help 😭🙏🏽",3,1747685803.0,AmItheAsshole,26,0.71,False
