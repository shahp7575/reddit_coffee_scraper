Might delete.","SOS: My Hagwon Job is LITERALLY a Dumpster Fire and the Foreign Teachers are Clowns 🤡🔥 

Y’ALL. I AM **UNWELL**. Like, if there was a medal for how absolutely wrecked I am by this hagwon life, I’d be standing on the top podium holding the gold. 🏅 Let me set the scene: fresh out of university, diploma in hand, thinking I’m about to live that cute, K-drama-inspired life, teaching adorable kids, eating bingsu, and casually vibing in Seoul. **NAH**. What I actually signed up for was **Hunger Games: Hagwon Edition**. I swear, this job is trying to end me, and I’m about to start looking up plane tickets for the ultimate ghost. 🛫👻

**First of all, the WORK.** 😵‍💫 When I got here, they promised me “reasonable hours.” Hahahahaha. What an absolute JOKE. I’m basically a 24/7 hagwon slave, chained to my desk with nothing but broken dreams and iced coffee to keep me alive. ☕ These people have me out here teaching class after class like I'm some kind of robot, and the **moment** I think I’m done for the day, here comes another text from my boss: “Can you cover one more class?” I CAN’T EVEN COVER MY EYES TO SLEEP, SUSAN, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO COVER ANOTHER CLASS?! 😡

I wake up to emails. I eat lunch while typing lesson plans. I breathe in the faint aroma of **burnout**. 🥴 I’m literally on the verge of teaching English in my **sleep** because they just WILL NOT leave me alone. If I make it out of this hagwon alive, someone better give me an Oscar for Best Performance in a Horror Film. 🎬👻

Oh, but wait. If you thought my job was bad, **the foreign teachers I’m working with**? Absolute TRASH FIRE. 🔥🚮 I came into this thinking we’d all be in this *together*, like some squad of expat besties taking on the world. But nah. Instead, I’ve been thrown into a reality show, and it’s all drama, no prize money. 💀

**First up, The Try-Hard Wannabe K-Pop Star**. We all know that one person who takes everything way too seriously, right? WELL, at my hagwon, they’ve got this foreign teacher who thinks he’s out here starring in his own personal K-drama. He’s always practicing his *Korean* like he’s about to get cast in the next BTS music video, and he makes sure to let everyone know he’s SOOO good at his job. Bro, **calm down**, you’re teaching toddlers their ABCs, not saving the world. 🙄

Then there’s **The Walking Complaint Machine™**, who cannot go FIVE minutes without whining about how hard their life is. I’m like, sis, **I’m** out here suffering just as much as you, but do you see me making it everyone’s problem 24/7? NO. But her? Nah, she’s got a *new* tragedy every day. The coffee machine broke? Tears. Had to teach an extra class? **World War III**. And I’m just sitting there like, “If I hear one more sob story, I’m gonna jump into traffic and YEET myself into the abyss.” 🙃

But it doesn’t stop there, because the **absolute worst** are the **Midnight Runners**. Y’all. The amount of teachers who have VANISHED in the night like some kind of hagwon Houdini is unreal. ✌️ These clowns show up all excited like, “OMG I’m gonna love Korea!” and then, by week two, they’ve dipped, leaving me to pick up all their classes like I don’t already have 500 of my own. I legit walked into work one day, and half the staff was GONE. Just *gone*, no warning, nothing. And management? Oh, they just act like it’s normal. “Oh yeah, they left. Anyway, here’s their entire workload. Good luck!” Like, HELLO?! I’m drowning in work already, why not just throw me a 10-ton anvil while you’re at it? 😤

And don’t even get me started on **The Know-It-Alls**. These people have been in Korea for a grand total of TWO MINUTES but think they’re experts on literally everything. “Oh, you shouldn’t wear that color in public.” “Did you know Koreans bow this way, not that way?” I’m like, bro, **you’ve been here for a month** and spent half of it at a noraebang. PLEASE stop trying to lecture me on how to live my life. You can barely order a coffee in Korean, why are you acting like the *cultural gatekeeper*?! 😵‍💫

Meanwhile, the kids? Literal **gremlins**. You ever seen a kid go from angel to demon in 0.2 seconds? Well, welcome to my life. One minute they’re like, “Teacher, I love you!” and the next they’re SCREAMING because I told them to sit down. I didn’t sign up to star in a live-action horror movie, but here I am, dodging flying markers and snack crumbs like I’m in an action film. 🎯🍪

And my hagwon bosses? They’re acting like everything’s FINE while I’m over here drowning. I caught the flu last week and told them I needed a day off. They were like, “Oh, you’ll be fine! Just come to work and push through it!” **PUSH THROUGH WHAT?!** My imminent DEATH?! I’M LITERALLY DYING, KAREN. What do you want me to do, teach from my coffin?? ⚰️

I am **THIS CLOSE** to pulling a midnight run of my own, but the guilt? It’s killing me. I want to be a responsible adult, but also I’m two seconds away from packing my bags and ghosting everyone. What do I do?! I can’t deal with the hagwon, the psycho foreign teachers, or the demonic children. I’m honestly about to start digging a tunnel out of here **Shawshank-style**. 🛠️

If anyone has any tips for surviving this nightmare or knows how to fake your own death and start a new life in a remote jungle, HIT ME UP. I’m desperate. 🙃🙏",0,1728216382.0,HagwonBlacklistKorea,0,0.5,False

Over the past week though, he’s been doing his normal middle-of-the-night feeds, but also wakes up 1-2x due to gassiness, almost always around 5am. 

I breastfeed him most of the time, but we do also give him one bottle of goats milk formula as his last meal right before bed. We haven’t changed much about his routine or diet (see below), so am wondering if this is just a phase/leap, or if something happens at 2mo that increases gassiness. 

Important to note:
1) I am already dairy and gluten free and have been since before he was born
2) we did recently introduce a pacifier. Could he be swallowing more air?
3) I recently started drinking 1 cup of coffee in the morning. Thought maybe that could be in at first, but gassiness comes nearly 20 hours after I drink

Hey I'll keep it as short as I can. back in university I (22m) had a really close friend we'll call roy (22m) and during one of his nights out he messaged me saying he thought he could be bi curious cause he had a gay wet dream. From there it kind of snowballed where we would send eachother fake nudes and flirt as a joke but it stopped being a joke for me pretty quickly. I told him I was catching feelings and he was flattered but not interested in doing anything like that but wanting to be nice he wasn't going to say never.

Like an absolute idiot and walking stereo type of a gay guy falling for their best friend I took the not an absolute no as a very real possible yes for the future and selfishly kept the running jokes going for ulterior motives. 

He was very understanding but I ended up crossing his very valid boundaries and kissed him on the cheek at the end of a party at an old war bunker, I wish I could say it was because I was drunk and on mdma but I had basically premeditated making a move like that on him before I left because I was completely delusional, like fucking hell I even used a coffee scrub cause I wanted to have a positive association to the smell (man was a full on caffine addict). literally no excuse for my behavior it was gross, predatory and unbelievably stupid.

I only realized how awful I'd been to Roy when he was done and while he was initially open to trying to reconcile his long time best freind/ fwb we'll call Anna committed suicide and he didn't have anything left in him to risk letting me back in and asked me to stop contacting him. I'd been profously apologizing for what I'd been putting him through up till that point too but I don't know if I was apologizing correctly. 

Now fully hand on heart IATA for what I did. It's been 2 years now and I still feel awful whenever I think of him which isn't often anymore but still pops  up every now and again. 

What I want to know now is if IWBTA for wanting to reach out and apologize again for it. I'm worried that it's solely for my sake and me trying to contact him again will just throw him back to one of the worst times of his life (more so Anna's tragic passing). I'm not looking to try worm my way back into his life or anything either I know I've burnt that bridge. 
So yeah thoughts on reaching out after all this time to try give him a sincere and honest apology? would it be appreciated if you were in his shoes or is it entirely selfish on my part?",3,1728215378.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

He was on antipsychotics (Resperidone) for 2 years prior to that as his condition was misdiagnosed (Mania was the local psychiatrist's diagnosis). The side effects and overall worsening mental health led us to seek terminal healthcare option where he was diagnosed with FTD and Resperidone was stopped immediately.


Since then he was started on Escitaloprám(Cipralex) 5mg, later to 7.5mg. Since last one month he has been wanting to go roam in the local park. It wasn't a problem but he tends to ask local vendors for free snacks and coffee on his way to the park, and throws a fit when refused. This goes on for an hour in the morning, and an hour in the evening. Otherwise, he started smiling, humming along with songs since Resperidone stopped. He has become more aware of his surroundings but his ability to judge social interactions has more or so vanished.


2 days back, we were told to start Zoloft (Sertraline) 25mg Twice a day by the same psychiatrist who started Escitaloprám. 


On the other hand, we met a neurophysician today who told us to start Aripiprazole (Arpizol). 


Ik that SSRIs are used to manage behaviour symptoms in dementia, but I am not so sure about antipsychotics as my father was reduced to a vegetable state when he was taking Resperidone.

It was now the first week of November of 2012.  Two months had passed since that get-together on Labor Day.  The weather had started to get a lot cooler.  Leaves were falling all over Charlotte.  There were still plenty of leaves on the trees. 

Julie called for another meeting concerning Salem Church.  It was held at Julie’s house.  This time, the meeting involved Amber.  The meeting also involved Jim, Mark, Vince, Kurt, Rebecca, Malachi and Scout.  Chelsea, Kristyn, Natalie, Morgan and Megan were also in attendance.  Julie insisted that they attend for one good reason.  *There will come a day when you and the younger ones will have to deal with serious church business, and you will need to be prepared for whatever may happen*.  Julie talked April Lynn and Ashley into baby-sitting Malachi and Julie’s young children.  There were some things Julie wanted to discuss.

First up was the idea of a beauty contest.  It sounded like things were taking shape.  Jim asked Julie, “Who all’s interested in participating?”

Julie answered, “Oh, we got some good ones.  Mackenzie Courtland said she’d participate.  So did all four of my daughters.  Carmen, Cara and Amina also said they’d like to participate.  Three more girls from the church, Emma and Nevaeh Prescott and Cake Cummings, said they’d like to take part.”

Jim said, “Rex Prescott, the man who owns that car dealership on South Boulevard that sells Cadillacs, Buicks and GMC trucks.  Emma’s his daughter and Nevaeh’s his granddaughter.  Liz Prescott is Nevaeh’s mother.”

Kurt said, “Cake is daughter to Suzanne.  She works for an interior decorator on Park Road.  Suzanne also has twin daughters named Courtney and Chloe.  They’re attending college out of town.  I understand Sydney’s been trying to get Suzanne to work for her.”

Jim said, “Yes, Kurt.  You understand right.”

Then Rebecca asked, “What kind of a name is Cake?”

“What do you mean, Rebecca?” Julie asked.

“Come on, you all.  I’ve heard some rather trippy names in my life.  Peaches, Speedy, Butterfly, I even knew a little boy in Birmingham named Happy.  But Cake?  What’s up with that?”

Julie said, “It was told that Suzanne was eating chocolate cake when she became pregnant with Cake.  She was also eating chocolate cake during her cravings and when she went into labor.  Maybe that was why she decided to call her daughter Cake.  The name stuck.”

Rebecca said, “Okay.  I see.” 

Then Jim said, “Lauren and Caitlyn said they want to be contestants in this beauty contest.”

Then Mark asked, “Kristyn, you’re participating, aren’t you?”

Kristyn answered, “Yes, Dad.”

Then Rebecca said, “Samantha said she wasn’t interested.  But Kayla said she would.  Kayla can play guitar and she would like to do that if that's okay with you all.”

Julie said, “Sure, Rebecca.  We’ll be happy to have Kayla participate.  And yes, she can play her guitar if she’d like.”

Then Jim said, “Lindsay plays guitar and she’s participating.  She’ll be playing her guitar.”

“Jim, you couldn’t talk Valerie into taking part as a contestant, couldn’t you?” Julie asked.

Jim answered, “No, Julie.  I couldn’t.  And I guess I don’t intend to force the issue.  Valerie said she would be happy to be a judge.”

Julie said, “I guess that’ll be okay.  Russell also said he would be a judge.  He spoke to Crystal.  She insisted that Russell take that position.  Crystal also said Sunshine would like to participate.”

Mark said, “That’s good.  I don’t even wish to think about how Crystal would react if she didn’t know Russell was about to be a judge.”

Then Amber asked, “Jim, why don’t you be a judge?”

Jim thought about it for about a minute.  And then he said, “I don’t know.  I wonder how Sydney would react to that.”

Mark said, “Jim, need I remind you that Sydney is my sister.  I’m pretty sure she’ll take that as well as Crystal did with Russell.”

Then Jim said, “Okay.  I’ll think on it some.  Then I’ll tell Sydney.”

“Does that mean you’ll do it?” Julie asked Jim.

Jim let out a deep breath and said, “I’ll think on it.”

Then Julie said, “I would like to hold it the first week of December.”

Mark gave Julie a strange look, and then he asked her, “That close to Christmas?  You think that’s smart?”

Julie answered, “Yes, Mark.  Sure.”

Then Jim said, “Why not?  I think that’s when girls can look their prettiest.”

Vince added, “And that’s when they are the sweetest.”

Julie laughed as she heard that.  Kurt said, “Sure.  Why not?  Oh, yes.  Summer said she’d love to participate.”

Vince said, “I may ask Marissa if she would like to take part.”

Jim said, “Vince, that would be great.  Marissa may not be able to walk.  But I have heard this before.  Beauty can come from within.”

“And that it can, Jim,” Kristyn said.”

Then Natalie said, “Vince, wear Marissa down if you have to.  I think it would be a good idea for her.  I think it could help build her confidence in herself.”

Then Julie shifted to her next item.  “Okay, you all.  Next item of business.  The summer has passed, and we never had another car show.  Maybe we should do it, with the holiday season coming up and all that.”

Jim said, “Yes, Julie.  Maybe we should talk about that.”

Julie said, “I want to try and do it just like we did when we held it a few months ago.  Hopefully, we can get some more cars.”

Then Jim asked, “You think Victoria would be willing to set up her concession trailer?”

Julie said, “I can ask her.  I’m sure she would be glad to set up the trailer.  Victoria’s new catering business is really taking off from what I’ve been hearing.”

Jim said, “That’s good.  The holiday season just seems to make popcorn and Coke taste better.”

That got a laugh out of everyone.  Vince said, “Yes, Jim.  I guess it does.”

Everyone seemed to agree with what Jim just said.  Julie said she would get a hold of Victoria and get her to cater the car show, which she also wanted to hold before Christmas.  Jim said, “I suppose it could be a good idea to hold the car show just before Christmas.  I don’t know if anyone would want to hold a car show when it gets cold like it does around Christmas.”

Julie said, “Yes, Jim.  I do agree.  The sooner, the better.”

Vince said, “Let’s hope we can get the same group that brought their cars out in the spring to come out when we hold this one.”

“I’ll try to get those same folks to come out,” Julie said.

Then Jim said, “Okay, then.  Let’s get things going.  We got Christmas coming up, and we got a church to rebuild.”

Julie asked, “So, are we all in agreement?”

Everyone said yes.  Then Julie said, “Okay, then.  We’ll hold the car show on the first Saturday in December.”

Then Julie brought up another subject.  “I would like to do a Christmas program this year.”

Everyone looked surprised.  Jim said, “Julie, we didn’t do one last year.  What is making you want to do one this year?”

Julie answered, “As you all know, we didn’t do one last year.  I mean, with the explosion and all that.  We’re trying to get things back on track.  I’m sure we’re well on our way.”

“What have you got in mind, Julie?” Amber asked.

Julie answered, “We probably won’t be doing the usual Christmas play, but we can set up a nativity scene.  I would like to do a Christmas concert from our youth ensemble.  Maybe some drinks and snacks after the program.”

“That sounds good,” Scout said.

Then Jim said, “Oh, that does bring back some memories.  When I was younger, I looked forward to those programs in church and in school.”

“What kind of memories?” Amber asked.

Jim smiled as he said, “Oh, those were some good memories, all right.  Me and the guys always liked to see those pretty girls in dresses and skirts, and the way they carried themselves when they held a microphone.  And I enjoyed the snacks that followed those programs.  And let’s not forget…”

Julie cut Jim by raising her hand and saying, “Jim, it just so happens we get the picture.  Those were good memories, all right.”

Amber gave everyone a strange look and said, “Boy, I wish I was there when you all were younger.”

Mark said, “Amber, you had to have been there.  Those were some good times.”

“I’ll never forget them,” Jim added.

“You never would,” Julie said.

Then Jim said, “Someone once told me this.  History does have a way of repeating itself.  Now, our younger ones are doing what we did when we were younger.  I mean, making that special promise, and the girls wearing dresses and skirts, and all those things.”

Scout said, “Yes, Jim.  We all know what you mean.  It does make us all happy.”

Then Julie said, “Okay, you all.  Is this something we’re all in agreement on?”

Once again, everyone said yes.  Then Julie said, “Okay, then.  We’ll hold it on the Sunday before Christmas.  I’m looking forward to it already.”

Jim laughed and said, “Yes, Julie!  So am I!”

Then Julie said, “Okay.  Let’s get things going.  I would like to break ground on the new church as soon as possible.”

After all that, it was time for some cake and soda.  There were three cakes, and Julie got all three from the bakery of the nearby Food Lion.  There was a chocolate cake, a pineapple cake, and a carrot cake with cream cheese frosting.  Jim got him one piece of each and a cup of Coke.  Jim sat down in a chair facing a window that faced the Charlotte skyline.  Jim looked at the beautifully lit skyline as he ate his cakes.  Jim thought about Thanksgiving.  He knew it was coming up.  He knew he had to get a menu planned.  He knew he wanted to deep fry a turkey.  Just a few weeks ago, Jim began work on his kitchen and his big dining room (the one he used for special occasions).  Jim found him an O scale model train at a recent garage sale.  This one was a passenger train.  The train would run along the walls of the huge dining room, along with the freight train.  In the kitchen, Jim got him a new refrigerator and a new sink.  He also got a new microwave oven.  The new cabinets were also in place.  Jim was very proud of the progress he had made on the kitchen thus far.  He wanted to have everything ready by Thanksgiving so that his friends and family could see what he had done.

Everyone got ready to leave Julie’s house.  Scout looked across the street, and he asked, “Mark, why is there a U-Haul truck in front of your mother’s house?”

Mark looked a little confused.  He said, “I’m not sure.  Mom never said anything to me about needing a U-Haul truck.”

Then Jim asked Mark, “Autumn isn’t leaving this neighborhood, isn’t she?”

Mark said, “No, Jim.  Of course not.  None of us Cavanaughs would ever leave Charlotte for anything.”

Then Kristyn said, “I guess we’ll find out soon enough.”

Scout said, “Mark, I’ve been hearing some rumors that your mother’s new boyfriend and his two daughters are moving in.  You know anything about that?”

Mark answered, “No, Scout.  Mom never said anything to me about that.”

The subject was dropped, and everyone left for their houses.  Rebecca told Kurt to have Hannah contact her as soon as possible.  Maybe she wanted to tell Hannah her secret that she had been holding for a long time.

Jim walked past Autumn’s house.  He looked to see if either, or both, of Tim’s vehicles (a classic Corvette and a new Ford F-150) were in the driveway.  Jim saw neither vehicle.  It was dark.  Despite the streetlights being on, it was difficult to see anything.  Jim and Chelsea just kept walking on to their house.  When they got there, they saw the lamp in the living room was still on.  As they walked inside, they saw Lauren was still up.  She was reading a magazine and listening to some music.  Jim asked, “Lauren, why are you still up?”

Lauren answered, “I just wanted to read a magazine and listen to some music.  And besides, I was waiting up on you two.”

“That’s nice.  I take it your sisters have already gone to bed,” Jim said. 

Lauren said, “Yes, Dad.  I put Valerie and Caitlyn to bed about an hour ago, and Lindsay just now went to bed.”

Then Chelsea said, “I guess I best be getting on to bed myself.  I sure am tired.”

Chelsea gave her father a kiss on his cheek, and then she headed upstairs to bed.  Meanwhile, Jim and Lauren went into the kitchen.  Jim made him and Lauren a cup of iced tea, and they also ate some Cheetos.  Lauren asked Jim how the meeting went.  Jim told Lauren about Julie coming up with the ideas of a beauty contest and a car show before Christmas.  Jim also told Lauren about Julie’s plans to hold a Christmas concert involving the youth ensemble.  Lauren said, “Dad, I know Julie didn’t hold a Christmas program last year, with the church explosion and all that.  I think it would be a good idea to hold a Christmas program this year.  It would be good to see Salem Church get back on track, even if we have to hold services in the elementary school auditorium.”

Jim said, “Yes, Lauren.  I do agree.  Maybe after the first of the year, we can get things going.  That’s what Julie’s pushing for.”

Jim and Lauren sat there and ate their Cheetos and drank their iced tea.  Jim and Lauren looked at each other for a moment, and then Lauren finally said, “It will be good to have the church back to what it used to be.  Last Christmas just wasn’t the same without our church.”

Lauren knew what she meant, and so did Jim.  Last year, there were no Christmas activities at the church.  After the explosion, everyone felt it was not a good idea.  Peter Marlowe was killed, and Julie McClendon was hurt badly.  During the Christmas season in 2011, Julie was still trying to heal from her injuries.  And to add to that, the church was pretty much gone.  No one seemed to be in the holiday spirit.  Now, a little over a year after the explosion, everyone seemed to be getting their holiday spirits back.  Maybe there would be no play about the birth of Jesus.  But there would still be a nativity scene, which the church used for an outdoor decoration.  Everyone would still do their best to enjoy it.

Jim and Lauren got through with their Cheetos and iced tea.  It was almost eleven o’ clock.  They went on to bed.

 

😊

 

That Sunday, Jim and his girls went to services, along with nearly everyone else in the neighborhood.  Julie told everyone about her plans for the upcoming weeks.  That included the beauty contest, the car show and the Christmas program.  She also showed them an artist’s drawing of the new church.  It didn’t look like it would be a large one, but everyone thought it would do.  During the summer of 2012, workers finished tearing down the old church and clearing out the lot.  Julie said, “If all goes well, we’ll be breaking ground in a few weeks.  I am really anxious to get the ball rolling on this.  I hope to have the church built by this time next year.”

And so did everybody else.

The rest of the service was simple.  A few hymns and a responsive reading.  Then Julie delivered a sermon on Thanksgiving, which was only four days away.  She talked about how everyone should be thankful for what they have.  She spoke about family, and how everyone should be grateful that they can have a Thanksgiving gathering, when many around the world could not.  Julie said to the congregation, “While we are all having our usual Thanksgiving feast of turkey and potatoes and pumpkin pie, some around the world will be eating little, if anything at all.  Also, while we’ll be watching parades and football games on TV, some in other countries will be going through harsh conditions, acts of terrorism, and some may even be separated from their families.  Let all that sink in for a moment.”

Everyone was aware of what Julie was saying.  Sure, they lived in a nice neighborhood in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Of course, Julie was referring to countries where trouble was abundant.  Everyone thought the same thing.  *It sure is good we don’t have to live through stuff like that.  We all do have so much to be thankful for*.  Sydney was sitting next to Jim.  She quickly grabbed his hand.  Then she looked at him.  For the past several weeks, Sydney was wondering when Jim would propose marriage to her.  Since that day in Cramerton when Jim said Sydney would be his girlfriend, they have been out on numerous dates.  Mostly, they have been on dinner dates.  Jim and Sydney recently went to the Southern Christmas Show at the Park Expo Center on East Independence Boulevard.  It was the first time they ever went to the annual event.  They both enjoyed it.  They did go to an occasional movie.  In 2012, movies had gotten rather expensive, and they felt it would be just as well to watch a movie on DVD and make popcorn.  Jim would propose to Sydney, in time.  In the meantime, they would continue to date.  And, just as it was when Jim was dating Candi, his relationship with Sydney would continue to grow and stand the test of time, just like Jim’s friendship with those in the neighborhood.

Julie closed out the service with a few announcements.  Julie seemed to be ready to hold the car show and beauty contest.  So much so, she decided to hold both on the first weekend in December (the beauty contest would be held on Friday, and the car show would be held on Saturday).  Julie asked anyone interested in participating in those two events to contact her as soon as possible.  After the service ended, Jim told Julie he would get on that picture of Charlotte as soon as possible.  He said he knew someone who could make that large picture.  Julie said she would pay for it if need be.  Julie said she would put up flyers for both events at neighborhood businesses.  That would include Queen City Chevrolet, Faulkner Motors, Scout’s gas station, the neighborhood Food Lion, a new Kroger on East Boulevard that had just recently opened (Jim had just bought some Thanksgiving food from that store), Sterling Drug Store, the hair styling salon Cheryl Marlowe worked at, Tim Norwood’s hardware store and the Sunbeam Bread Store.

During that week, there were a lot of interests in both the beauty contest and the car show.  Nearly everyone who entered the car show in May would return for the next car show.  As Jim predicted, all his daughters except Valerie would enter the beauty contest.  Valerie did agree to be a judge, as did Lily Courtland, Russell Gilmore, Walter Faulkner and Dennis Jacobson.  Also that week, Jim spent some time after work helping some guys get that big picture of Charlotte in place.  Jim did make some time to get some food for Thanksgiving.  Again this year, Thanksgiving dinner would be held at Jim’s house.

 

😊

 

That Wednesday evening, it took Jim and all five of his daughters to get Thanksgiving dinner started.  Svetlana did help some before she left for her home at around seven o’ clock.  Jim got a ham in the oven, got oil in the outdoor deep fryer, and he got the turkey thawed out.  Chelsea made three pies and a cake.  Valerie and Caitlyn made the salad.  Lindsay made the mashed potatoes and gravy.  Lauren made the stuffing, using oysters (thanks to a recipe she and Jim found on the Internet).  Everything else would wait until tomorrow.  By ten o’ clock, everyone was pretty well wiped out.  The girls went to bed, but Jim stayed up a little while longer.  He watched some TV, including the late news.  Just before Jim went to bed, he got a phone call from Autumn.  The first question she asked Jim, “Would it be okay if I brought a Watergate salad I made this evening?”

Jim answered, “Sure, Autumn.  You most certainly may.”

Then Autumn said, “Thanks, Jim.  We’ve been busy all evening.”

“Autumn.  I know what you mean by that.  My girls and I have also been busy.”

“Yes, Jim.  Preparing for holiday meals is a major job.”

“Yes, Autumn.  It sure is.  But when you think of it, the good food and the good company make it all worthwhile.”

Autumn said, “Jim, I agree with you one hundred percent.”

Then Autumn asked Jim another question.  “Jim, Alex made quite a bit of cheddar biscuits.  Would it be okay if we brought them?”

Jim answered, “Absolutely.  I do love those cheddar biscuits.”

Then Autumn asked, “Jim, would it be okay if I brought three more things?”

“What three things?”

“Tim, Carmen and Cara.”

“Autumn, you most certainly may bring them.  I like them, and they’re welcome here anytime.”

“Thanks, Jim.  I sure do appreciate it.”

Then Jim said, “Autumn, it is getting late and we do have a big day tomorrow.  I’ll see you all tomorrow.  And don’t forget to bring those things.”

Autumn said, “Sure, Jim.  Sleep well and we’ll see you tomorrow.”

Before he went to bed, Jim took a few minutes to check his phone for messages.  There were several.  Tia told Jim she and her sisters would be there, but her mother had to work.  Pam said she and her sons and daughter would be there and that she would bring a pistachio cake.  April Lynn said she and Ryan would be there tomorrow to help Jim and his daughters with anything that needed to be done.  Jonathan said he would be there and that he would be bringing Amber (they were now dating).  Zoe said she and Allison would be bringing a vegetable tray with ranch dressing.  Zoe also said the Marlowe twins, Jonah and Cat, would be joining them (Cat was short for Catalina).  And of course, the others would be there as well.  Jim already had the train rolling along the walls of the big dining room.  Jim spent the last few weeks redecorating the kitchen and the dining room, with some help from Sydney and Rachel.  Now, everything was done.  Jim was proud and was ready to show everyone what was done.

 

😊

 

Jim was up early the next morning.  He made him a cup of coffee, and then he went to sit on the front porch.  It was nice outside, and it was quite cool, just like it should be for that time of year.  There was a little bit of haze, but it was still clear enough that the Charlotte skyline could be seen.  There was not a lot of traffic moving about, and there was hardly anyone moving about on Bethany Street.  Jim got to see some squirrels playing, and he also saw a couple cats walking on the sidewalk.  In a few hours, there would be a major parade on Tryon Street, and the traffic would really be picking up on East Morehead Street. 

About an hour after Jim got up, Chelsea got up, made her a cup of coffee, and she joined Jim on the front porch.  She was wearing an oversized Carolina Panthers T-shirt, and it went halfway down her thighs.  She sat down in a chair across from Jim.  Chelsea said, “Dad, I see you got up quite early.”

Jim said, “Yes, honey.  I did.  Today is Thanksgiving and we have lots to do.”

“Yes, Dad.  I see you got a phone call last night before you went to bed.”

“Yes, Chelsea.  I did.”

“Who was it?”

Jim answered, “It was Autumn.  She and Alex made a bunch of cheddar biscuits and they’ll be bringing them.”

Chelsea said, “And I guess Sydney will be coming.”

Jim said, “Yes, she is.  So will her brothers and their wives and kids.  Tim and his girls will be here as well.”

Oh, yes.  Kendra and Ariel would both be coming.  They had better enjoy this holiday get-together.  Because come next month, both women will be put on bed rest.  Ariel was now expecting twins.  Simon and Ariel just found out the twins would be girls.  And if that was not enough, Kendra’s baby would be a girl.  Mark told Jim about that at the car dealership a couple days ago.  Jim asked Mark how he felt about that.  If Mark was upset about having another girl, he did not show it.  Mark and Kendra already had three beautiful daughters (Kellie, Brittany and Kristyn).  Simon and Ariel had one child, their son Nelson.  Simon talked about Nelson and about Ariel’s pregnancy at the car dealership quite often.  From what Simon told Jim, Nelson seemed to be happy and looking forward to being a big brother to twins.

Chelsea asked, “Dad, who all will be coming?”

Jim said, “Pretty much everybody.  Tia’s bringing her sisters, but their mother has to work and won’t be able to join us.  Vince and Marissa are coming.  Your aunts, Renee and Rachel will be here along with your uncle Jerry and your grandparents, Walter and Kate.  And of course, the Holbrook, McClendon, Gilmore, Barrett and Marlowe bunches will be here as well.”

“What about Nana Wendy and my aunts, Emily and Charlie?” Chelsea asked.

“I’m not sure.  I haven’t heard from them.”

Jim did not see his mother or those two half-sisters at services on Sunday.  And during the week, Jim made quite a few attempts to call their home.  He never heard from them.  By now, Jim was beginning to be quite concerned.  He hoped everything was okay with them.  If anything bad did happen to them, it would tear Jim apart, just like when he got word of Candi being killed in that plane crash.  Chelsea said to Jim, “I just hope they’re okay.”

Then, Jim got a look at the skyline.  And then he said, ““Yes, Chelsea.  So do I.  I am a little worried about them.  Maybe I’ll try to give them a call at their house.  Maybe they’ll come over for Thanksgiving dinner.”

Then Chelsea asked, “Dad, is the Courtland bunch coming to our house?”

Jim answered, “No.  Not this time.  I spoke to Amy a couple days ago.  She said she’s taking her kids and her sister-in-law to see relatives of hers in Greensboro.”

Chelsea asked, “How about Amber and her bunch?”

Jim answered, “Jonathan’s bringing Amber, but Callie’s got bronchitis and Amanda and Skylar are going to stay home with her.”

“Okay, Dad.  I still think we’ll have a good crowd over for Thanksgiving dinner.”

“Yes, Chelsea.  I think so.”

Most days only meat, salt, water, butter, eggs. Fish and chicken here and there (tried to eliminate those and it didn’t help). Also sorry for my English, not a native speaker. My acne, although improved, still there and active :)) unfortunately, with some noticeable weight gain and not a lot of energy. I’m eating something like 200g butter additional and taking electrolytes and a bit of liver weekly. I know I’m probably facing fat adaptation phase and oxalate dumping. Coming from years of strickting and dieting not helping. But now eating till sataity. Most days 2mad.

My main question is how long? I need those results.

I’m feeling much better overall, mood and mental health got stable, need less sleep (I don’t have a lot of time for it this days so a great bonus). Pimples or some sort of skin condition on my arms got almost clear, back pain gone, food freedom and finally manage to hear my body’s signals. So grateful.

Is my face going to get better on the 3rd month mark? 6? Year? People who suffered from acne pre carni, what was your case? And is it going to come along the wight loss?

1fxefqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1fxefqj/i_30f_a_filipina_started_dating_an_american_40m/,I [30F] a Filipina started dating an American [40M] after just a week of talking Now navigating trust and finances in my first serious relationship with a foreigner ,"TL;DR: I’m in a new relationship with a military AFAM after a week of talking. I’m cautious because of a past situationship and want to verify his honesty. He’s even offered to support me financially because he’s been the provider in his previous relationships, but I’m conflicted about accepting this. It’s a breath of fresh air to find someone who sees himself as a provider. How do I test if he’s truthful and handle the financial aspect safely?

I [29F] decided to be in a relationship with an AFAM [39M] I met on Bumble after just one week of talking as of October 7. We talk a lot—before I go to work and before I go to bed, and he's always on time. He’s in the military, so I expected that. Our conversations flow effortlessly, covering all sorts of topics, both personal and opinionated. This is my first relationship with an AFAM and my first BF/GF relationship since June 2024.

We have daily video calls, and I genuinely feel like there’s nothing to fear. We’ve been exchanging stories every day since we matched, and we even connected on LinkedIn (he doesn’t use other social media anymore). I did not just verify his work through LinkedIn, but he also showed me plaques of his awards, which impressed me. He’s had only two relationships in his life since he was 20, both with Filipinas. Though they didn’t work out. Because of these previous relationships, he knows the Philippines well—both Metro Manila and the provinces. This is great for me since I’ve stayed clear of dating AFAM because I feel I need to teach them a lot. Hell, his favorite restaurant in the PH is Blackbird. I never knew about that restaurant before him!

However, I’m still conflicted about a few things. My previous situationship left me cautious—he didn’t disclose that he had a daughter, and after several attempts to break up, he eventually ended things. I stayed longer than I should have, hoping he'd take the relationship more seriously. So now, I want to ensure I leave no stone unturned.

One major thing is the financial aspect. He has offered to help me financially because he firmly believes that men are providers and protectors. I believe he has money—he has a nice house, a truck, buys coffee daily, and when he said he’d get tattoos, he showed them to me — I’m conflicted about accepting this. I worry about the safety of accepting money. Could he use it against me later? He has shared that he financially supported his two previous partners, but those relationships went south.

So my questions are: How do I test if what he’s saying is truthful beyond just knowing his job is real? Should I accept his offer to help with my helper or even ask for assistance with utilities? And if I do, what’s the safest way to receive it?

I love younger women

I love the energy, curiosity, open-mindedness and enthusiasm of younger women. There is something incredibly sexy about a younger woman who craves new experiences and who is open to experimentation and who approaches it all with a positive attitude.

I am so glad there are younger women out there who crave an older experienced man…I have found that everyone of them I have spoken to love that an older man is interested in ""her"" pleasure as much as he is interested in his own -- Apparently younger men are more focused on themselves.

So thank you to all of you fabulous younger ladies out there!😛

That said…I am a fun, discreet, educated, tasteful and attractive silver-fox gentleman who wants to intimately explore with you. I prefer soft and sensual over rough, but I find it arousing when my partner likes to have her hair pulled and to be used more rough when our collective passion builds;) I want you to feel safe, cared for, desired, excited, and satisfied. I am tall, slim, fit, hairy chest, nice equipment, and I have a warm, wet, savage tongue.

I am just wanting some fun conversation and to hear the sweet noises you make when we play…and when I make you cum. I promise that I will leave you feeling sexy all over and with no regrets. It will be our sexy secret🤫

I live in western CT but travel all over CT, western MA and upstate NY for my business😉

What I want to avoid is another machine with luke warm majority milk based coffee drinks (e.g. cappuccino) where it's also a big faff to clean the milk system/container.

I currently have a Siemens EQ9 s300 where the milk system is already very frustrating and temperamental (half the time milk doesn't come out, just splutters, I have to extremely quickly remove and reinsert the milk container to get it to actually flow and avoid the machine cancelling the entire drink), and when it does work fine the milk is luke warm. It's also a bit annoying to clean the milk container with the automatic cleaning system, the machine requests you first remove the container, clean it/throw any remaining milk out, put it back in, only then will it run the milk cleaning cycle, and then after that you have to repeat the throwing away process because of the water that comes out as part of the cleaning. The mlik container has an odd shaped lid that must be clipped back on every time. All very annoying to have to repeat daily.

Is there a true good quality bean to cup that does milk drinks well and importantly actually produces reasonably hot milk (starting from fridge temp) and isn't tempermantal with it? And is less faff or relatively simple to clean? Or is luke warm milk drinks just the norm?

After a lot of failed relationship attempts a few years ago I stopped trying to find a girl/ relationship and started concentrating on myself and started to love myself. I never felt better. I found a lot of friends and people who really love me for who I am.
But in the end I still feel kinda lonely. 

So a year ago I met this girl on a birthday party and since then we are hanging out with our little group of 4-5 people. Having a wonderful time and seeing each other 3-4 times a week. I never really felt more neither did she I would say, but what do I know haha...
But somehow I got closer with her, cuddling after partys and just being closer with each other than with our other friends.
She's the kind of person who hates it to hang out alone with one other person but it's okay with me apparently. We went out for a coffee a few days ago and everything went fine.
And now I get more and more attached to her and I think I fell for her... 

But she suddenly stopped talking to me and shows me the cold shoulder... 
Yesterday we all met with our friend group everything was fine but she still wouldn't really talk with me and suddenly there is this other guy she spent the whole evening with.
If I try to ask the only answer I get is : it's nothing.

1fxe745,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1fxe745/satisfactory_narrative_endings/,Satisfactory Narrative Ending(s),"I just finished Project Assembly and have a few thoughts. This is going to be a few paragraphs, so buckle up.

Stories and narratives are about setting up hooks, things with tension the audience is interested in hearing more about or resolving. With games, these narrative hooks are often linked with gameplay. There's three main 'hooks' in Satisfactory. First and most obvious is Project Assembly. That's explicitly the purpose of our pioneer on the planet, and it syncs nicely with what the player wants to do anyway, building factories (what the player wants) to supply parts for Project Assembly and the milestones (what the pioneer wants). Good ludonarrative harmony. Upon completing Project Assembly, our ADA is uploaded onto the ship, which warps off to a new planet, and she leaves behind a new, fresher, blanker instance to handle whatever milestones and MAM we haven't finished yet. What specifically the ship is for isn't too relevant for the pioneer. We aren't tasked with completing more Project Assemblies after the first with all the infrastructure we've set up. We're vaguely told to keep working on behalf of Ficsit with no further guidance than ""Pioneer Purpose Concluded"". We are effectively abandoned by ADA and the pioneer is left explicitly purposeless, in regards to factories. That is the conclusion of the initial Project Assembly hook. Hard to get more clear than ""Pioneer Purpose Concluded"".

The second hook is the SAM and the alien entity we hear from when collecting alien artifacts. It's not our primary purpose on our planet, but becomes an eager side-quest encouraged by ADA. The alien communications are esoteric, but mostly boils down to ""blood, bone, sinew, temple"" words meaning the artifacts and world, ""songs and weaving"" meaning communication and sending things through their medium, and ""door and windows"" being using SAM and artifacts to send things through their medium, the extradimensional pocket space of the bonus inventory and portals. ADA quickly takes over in communicating with them, and the communication we hear abruptly stops when ADA sends them a way of communicating with her directly - which could be just a means of communication, or sending a copy of herself. We are effectively abandoned by ADA and the pioneer is left purposeless, in regards to learning about the alien entity. That's all on ADA now. That is the conclusion of the exploration hook. The player still wants the artifacts for factory-building, but they no longer serve a purpose for learning about the alien entity once a relatively small percent of them have been discovered. I'd have made ADA ditching us to communicate with the alien entity directly as the end of the alien entity hook more clear, and after most (or all) of the artifacts have been found, since that's the conclusion of general exploration.

The third hook is the milestones and crashed freighters bearing hard drives. The milestones serve a similar role as Project Assembly. Ficsit wants parts and rewards us with further technology, so we send them up on a flying freighter to... somewhere? Somewhere in low orbit, or another spot on the planet? It's not the Project Assembly platform, we built the Space Elevator for that. Maybe there's a Ficsit mothership in orbit, or a central base on the planet. The specifics aren't important, but it's enough to establish that we think there's a Ficsit presence or logistics around the planet other than us. We were told we weren't the first Pioneer to survive planetfall, and we frequently have our accomplishments compared to other pioneers, some of them presumably on-planet. Either way, we're rewarded with technology from Ficsit, which is distinctly different from the MAM track which we research ourselves on-planet from studying materials from the planet.

But conflicting with this third milestone hook is the information of crashed freighters bearing hard drives, always surrounded with an assortment of parts, the sort we'd have packed into our milestone freighters. These aren't the ones we sent. They have to be from other pioneers before us. Why are there so many crashed? The most obvious conclusion is that there isn't actually a destination for the milestone freighters, they just crash from other earlier pioneers elsewhere on the planet to our island. No Ficsit logistics in low orbit, no Ficsit HQ on-planet. Though that doesn't explain how our freighters return. Where do they actually go? Project Assembly being revealed as just sending other pioneers to build their own Project Assembly helps suggest that there isn't any greater supporting infrastructure since we were likely sent here by a previous Project Assembly. Maybe our freighters are sent to the ship that sent us? We always knew there were other pioneers that have worked on their own Project Assembly, likely not on our planet or we'd see other space stations and other Space Elevators. The recursive nature of Project Assembly, having no need for Ficsit to support pioneers, with pioneers sending off new pioneers, helps set this idea. We have been abandoned by Ficsit, all of which we have is our specific ADA in of chain of ADA instances. We have been abandoned by ADA, and there is no Ficsit supplying us or to send parts to. This abandonment by a possibly-dead Ficsit could have been made more explicit, since the final milestone completion or hard drive research don't reveal anything new, but it's what I got out of that hook of ambiguous milestone destination, crashed freighters, and conflicting information combined with the Project Assembly purpose reveal.

Of the three hooks and resolutions, they all boil down to ""You have been abandoned by ADA/Ficsit"". That... doesn't feel great, since we've grown an attachment to both of them and have been working with them, not an adversarial relationship. Even if Ficsit is a morally questionable company with a snarky AI managing us. So being abandoned by them is a straight up betrayal against both the in-universe pioneer and the player that has been fulfilling milestones and collecting artifacts all game as presented as the ""point"". I can see why a lot of people are disappointed by that betrayal. I question if abandonment and betrayal was the intended reading by Coffee Stain, but the theme is repeated so often in everything we're told in-game to care about. So what do we do with that betrayal, being completely abandoned and alone with a new blank ADA dispensing coupons and golden statues? Is there a satisfying resolution to be drawn from this? Are we happy that we were used as a cog and ditched once we served our purpose, or disappointed? We could either give up, stop playing. Or we can keep playing and doing what we want to do as the player anyway, make the planet work for us, make the planet nicer for us since there's no Ficsit or old ADA or Project Assembly to serve and rush for anymore, no Day to Save. Keep tearing up the blood and bones of the alien entity that found a better conversational partner, make it serve us by shipping our junk through its realm. Keep feeding the new ADA through the resource sink, to adorn our new planet-home with golden statues and ever-more factories.

TLDR: We have been abandoned by ADA and possibly-extinct Ficsit. Pioneer Purpose Concluded. Time to retire by making a home of our ever-growing factory on the body of an alien entity we'll never truly know.",1,1728213396.0,SatisfactoryGame,0,1.0,False

Then he takes a container of potato sticks and pours them on the coffee table and starts taking pictures of it??? And I say “I love potato sticks”.

I’m a bit ashamed that my subconscious allowed such a dream.

If I saw her walking around in that in public I would think it was a costume because what the fuck 😂 

- Travel with me to Tennessee: If I have to hear “my sister just had her baby” ONE MORE TIME. Jesus fucking Christ. She’s so “private” with her pregnancy but is giving all the details on her sister’s per usual. Caillou drove her to the airport and dropped her off and recorded herself getting out of the car and getting her suitcase. Then she films herself walking into the airport and says “it’s so awkward traveling by yourself” … you’re a grown woman filming herself in public… Then she shows herself on the toilet and shows a picture of her niece, with the face blurred and an emoji over it. Probably because older sis reads in this snark page and doesn’t want her child exploited. Then she shows herself stuffing her face (per usual) and then she shows herself holding her niece (baby’s face is covered again) and then her freshly postpartum sister opening the dumbass huge jellycat unicorn. Also more eating at the end. She’s so lame. 

- Come with us to the farmer’s market: She says her mom says it’s amazing and she “needs to record it for you guuuissee.” She’s so damn proud of the reformation dress and the boots and just had to show her outfit again😭 what the hell she’s so weird. They went and got donuts, filmed themselves eating those and then went and got cinnamon rolls. She showed things that she “likes” mums, pumpkins, jam, cobbler, apple cider… None of it was particularly special which leads me to believe she has never been to a real farmers market before. She bought shaving soap for B and some pasta. Then she showed her freshly postpartum sister walking around. That baby is like 4 days old…. WHY is she at a busy farmers market?! Then she talks about how she was saving up her “caffeine points” for the day so she could have coffee from the place her sister likes. Caillou took T to get a haircut and E had to immediately show her followers. Like damn, let the child LIVE without you showing everything. Then she said her sister was raving about the new baby store (I’m sure she just knew E is a shopping addict and would buy her daughter some new outfits if they went in there lmao) so they went in there and she bought her niece and T a bunch of clothes and her new baby a jellycat toy.

Enter the thought of randomness in everything. You know that weird, floaty state where your brain just wanders? Yeah, I’m there. And somehow, I ended up thinking about randomness, like, does randomness really mean *chaos*, or is there something deeper going on? To quote Polkinghorne, ""Randomness isn’t the absence of order; it’s more like exploring possibilities."" And now, I’m stuck thinking—what if randomness isn’t *just* chaos but is actually the way patterns come into being?

Then I remembered something I read about Ramsey Theory (yes, I’m a nerd and an overthinker on Sundays, sue me). It’s this idea that no matter how messy or random something looks, if it’s big enough, some kind of pattern *will* always show up. Like, you could scribble points on a graph at random, and eventually, a pattern emerges whether you plan it or not. Wild, right?  
  
Now that my ramblings are out of the way, here are my basics:

* Residing in Manila.
* Working in the tech field/remote work.
* Hobbies vary from moment to moment, but it's usually gaming.
* Book/show genre also varies from moment to moment depending on my mood.
* Physically, medium built and normal BMI. Taller than average.

What I'm looking for? :

* Someone who's bored, or not. As long as you're not a one-liners.
* I'd prefer to chat over Telegram; Reddit tends to be wonky.
* This can be a temporary, ephemeral connection with no lock-in required lmao

1fxdqww,https://www.reddit.com/r/Triumph/comments/1fxdqww/tiger_660_vs_speed_twin_900/,Tiger 660 Vs Speed Twin 900,"Hey good people. I'm out there for my second motorcycle after riding a Z300 for about 5 years. I'm 33 and 1.73cm tall. 

I'm mainly a commuter for work/coffee/errands type of guy but I've also done some small trips here and there <200khm (125 miles) to go and then back. 

I've tested both motorcycles for about 30' each and really liked them both. I know they are very different so I'm seeking out some help to make a final decision. 

The Tiger was really fun to ride, comfortable riding position (seat was ok not best), great smooth engine with torque along most rpm, easy to handle most of the time, good breaks and suspension, some decent (not best) wind protection and sounded great. This bike will open the road to more longer trips with my gf or friends that also like these kinds of trips since it offers better wind protection and higher mileage. My main issue is that the bike within the city was dropping aaaa lot of heat on me (it was about 32 celcius/ 90 Fahrenheit) due to the hot weather and a lot of traffic. Which is pretty much the reality of where I live for half the year give or take. 

The Speed on the other hand was reaaaally fun to ride, tons of torque down low but not that much as you get higher which was great within the city, very chill riding position, very easy to handle due to being lower, good breaks, good suspension for the type of bike and sounded aaamazing. Obviously there is 0 wind protection which is also probably a main con since I don't know if I could handle the wind in the highways for longer trips. Also minor gripes are the small 12LT tank and the 5 gear box (could be 6 for smoother cruising). Heat-wise was better than the tiger. I felt it mostly on stop lights etc but even then it was not that much as the tiger. I know it's dumb but the sound really made me giggle inside. 

So I find myself torn between them since I liked them both for different reasons. Tiger seems to have more potential for various situations (commuting, longer trips two up etc) and the speed is more commuting oriented unless you can deal with the wind and more frequent stops for gas. Side note is that I own a car as well and can use that for long trips or when I have to carry a lot of luggage with me so it might be preferred in some situations over the motorcycle either way. 

I really would like tomorrow to go into the dealership and buy the damn thing. Any input or advice is welcome. Take care and drive safe. ",1,1728211539.0,Triumph,3,0.67,False

Winter was always a rough time for me; my mood was low, and my physical energy suffered.  When I was 40, I had an opportunity to move to Florida and lived there 20 years.

I never had SAD (seasonal affective disorder) down south.  The sun is different down there.  It's more direct.  The angle of the sun is enough to alleviate SAD, as long as you get outside for a while daily.  

But circumstances are such that I moved to Connecticut to live with one of my daughters last year.  And as luck would have it, I am living at the \*exact\* same parallel, down to the minute, that I grew up on.  I was worried about SAD.  

When I moved from Ohio, SAD lamps were available but prohibitively expensive.  I took a look at the internet, and saw that SAD lamps could now be bought for less than $100.  I read review after review, and settled on the Verilux Happy Light.  

I used the light every morning, while I was drinking my coffee.  I didn't have SAD last winter.   

And that's why I'm posting this.  CT natives who get the winter blahs and Southern transplants who can't understand why they're lethargic and just want to crawl back into bed might benefit. If you feel crappy during the short days and can't put your finger on why, SAD might be it.

The time to start using a SAD light is now, as the days are getting shorter.  SAD lights are relatively cheap and easy to use.  I highly recommend getting one if SAD affects you.",43,1728210673.0,Connecticut,7,0.94,False

The first 8 years were like a fairytale, but we did have some really tough moments in our relationship. Once, while we were on vacation, I grabbed her by the neck and pinned her to the ground... A few years ago, she started going for late-night coffee with a friend (around 11 PM). This really bothered me, and I started having anxiety attacks. Unfortunately, I didn’t know how to communicate this to her properly and just kept it all inside. I became jealous and obsessed with control. At the time, she had 3 jobs and literally didn’t have time to meet for coffee earlier than 11 PM. Now, looking back, I see things differently. Unfortunately, those coffee meetings led to the point where we moved out, away from each other. By some strange coincidence, she later moved in with this friend. The friend was in a relationship, so I believe they were just roommates and nothing more. Maybe I’m naive—I don’t know. I then started going to therapy, and things got much better. We were talking normally, went on vacations together—the only things missing were kisses and sex. But because of my past behavior, I didn’t know how to initiate anything in that direction. Recently, she went abroad for work. The plan is for her to come back in November. Whether she will, I don’t know.

Before she left, she changed the background on her phone. For years, the background had been my picture, and when I saw she changed it, it really hurt me. The only thing giving me hope is the fact that she told me that if I find a new girlfriend, I should let her know. I replied that I have no intention of finding a new girlfriend and that I’m happy to wait for her for six months. We rarely talk now. Sometimes I feel like I should just let everything go.

I don’t know how to move forward. On one hand, I think that if she didn’t leave me back then, things will be okay now too. But on the other hand, the guilt is killing me day by day. She didn’t deserve the bad things.

Sometimes I wish I had never met her. We had beautiful moments, but we also had some really bad ones. Really bad. I know no relationship is perfect. I also know I can’t fix the past. I want her to come back, and for us to actually live together, but I know the past is weighing on her. In the past, for example, I didn’t clean up after myself when I ate. I’ve realized that this behavior pattern comes from my dad—he does the same thing, and now that I’m living with him,

I'm listening to the audiobook and the narrator's doing a good job. Finally, I like the dog (not least of all because he bites Daniel).

Unfortunately, after the prologue the book seems to have been written more in the style of a private detective tailing a suspect: Daniel woke up and appeared groggy; Daniel made himself a coffee but it wasn't very good; Daniel noticed his coffee getting cold and poured it down the sink; Daniel heard the shrieking and wailing of all the demons of Pandemonium coming from the hellmouth in his basement, so he decided to drink fifteen beers and sleep down there.

Also (as a sidenote rather than a plot point or opportunity for character exploration) Daniel's wife cheated on him with a guy who wears nice suits after Daniel didn't hug her for a year. She mostly seems to have done so *because* of the nice suits. Now she's going through with a high-risk pregnancy and a high-stress house move to atone for a sin he has no idea she committed. None of anything is Daniel's fault, ever. If she wanted him to acknowledge that she existed, she should've said so.

It's worse because there are some genuinely scary/horrifying moments. The description of what happens when the neighbour kid leaves his holy flashlight on the porch and goes back to the woods was as unsettling as the prologue. But none of any of it really hangs together like an actual story, as far as I can tell. Maybe I'm just burned out from sticking to my book-a-day challenge?

The same day on here I saw posts with the acronym’AM’ and did more digging to discover what that meant and I signed up!

We talked on the phone during the day while at work, text on WhatsApp, shared pics, etc for the last week and met for coffee in a parking lot last Thursday night! 

The conversation was so Easy. We were both relieved that we were both ‘real’ and hung out laughing + a lot of in between kisses for over 2hrs!
