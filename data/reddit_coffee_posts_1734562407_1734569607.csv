1hhgmmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/1hhgmmt/how_i_was_led_to_antimlm/,How I was led to antiMLM,"A few months ago I was in a situation where I had to flee an abusive home but I was unemployed. I'm Canadian and I knew that a friend of mine was here on a student visa and wasn't getting financial support from anyone, so I figured I would reach out to her and ask for advice since she was supporting herself while in school. We met in highschool when she started going to my school while being supported by parents. After she graduated though, they could no longer afford to support her. 

I reached out to her after asking for advice and she immediately responded with warmth, support, and practical advice. After a couple of weeks of chatting with her about the situation and her checking in on me, she asked if I'd be interested in a mentorship program which could help me start a small business (her running a small business didn't seem strange since it was quite common for girls in my hs to sell crocheted, knit or beaded crafts. One kid I knew funded their college tuition by selling digital art online. I myself have bought hats from one girl several times). Was unsure since I'm not interested in business, but she said I could just try it out to see if it's for me. Her mentor happened to be in town, having flown in from california for the week, so I met up with the two of them for coffee. I'm sure you all can assume how the coffee meeting went. They talked about network marketing, said how they've partnered with Apple and Nike, explained what an IBO was, but overall had a sense of vagueness. Talked about what made someone a good candidate for the mentorship program. Didn't tell me the name of their company and said they couldn't until the third meeting. They sent me a pdf of ""Business of the 21st century"" and asked me to read it by the end of the week and take notes on it to discuss the book at the next meeting. They walked to the train station with me.

*One thing that was unique to my experience I feel is that the mentor was fairly transparent about how much she earned. She told me that right now she only really earns enough to pay off her phone bill, but says that it'll grow in time and how her mentors are currently earning a lot. Although, I also mentioned a bit about my situation and she tried to fucking say that this program could teach me skills to reason with abusers ‚ÅâÔ∏è

At the end the first meeting, the mentor and my friend invited me to a community picnic that was happening the next day. They were both Vietnamese and it was run by a Vietnamese group in the city, but a lot of the people were also part of the business. I went and everyone was extremely friendly, however it felt like a similar friendliness like what you'd experience in south Asian/SE asian community events (I'm south Asian and have experienced this type of friendliness in pretty much every wedding/party/event that I've attended where I only knew one or two people lol). They were all urging me to try food, introducing themselves and asking me questions about myself. Saying things like ""oh I know you! You're [friend's] best friend! She talks about you all the time!"" (My friend wasn't able to make it). The mentor immediately gave me a hug when I saw her despite it being the second time that we had met (and I got a vibe from the first meeting that she wasn't particularly fond of me). People would push me towards the front of the food lines (one person had me try an XS drink and was saying ""isn't it incredible! There's no sugar in it at all"" lol). Everyone was complimenting my clothing and hair, asking me about myself, raving about the grocery store croissants that I brought to the picnic, just paying a lot of attention to me. I had one particularly vulnerable conversation with another girl in the group who talked about her situation with leaving an abusive aunt while we walked around the beach away from the rest of the group. She talked about wanting to be self employed and achieve financial freedom so she could support her family back in Vietnam and be able to visit them whenever she needed to in case of an emergency. Not everyone was involved with the business, but everyone talked about the same sort of things. Wanting financial freedom and dreams of supporting their families back in Vietnam. What was weird was how all of them managed to not mention the name of the business. They ended up giving me a ride home.

Anyways, skip forward to the second meeting and I wasn't able to get around to reading the book due to arguments in my home and school assignments. The mentor said that it was okay and told me to just take notes on her presentation about the book. She explained that for the third meeting, I'd be meeting the entire team.

Finally reaching the third meeting, we ended up having to reschedule due to a previous commitment that I had and instead of meeting the entire team, the mentor's mentor was their during the zoom meeting with his camera and microphone turned off. They revealed the company name ""amway"" showed me the videos and explained the compensation model, which made me doubt the entire thing. They also said that there was a seminar in our city the next week and said I should go since the first one is free to attend and it's a rare opportunity. The mentor also insisted that I get a ride home with my friend and her team. I agreed to it during the meeting since I was unsure, but ended upbresearching Amway later on and realized it was an MLM. Pretty much immediately just told my friend and her mentor that it just wasn't a good time for me to take up the opportunity and that I appreciate their time and apologize for taking up time from them.

The deeper I've been going into antiMLM, the worse this situation makes me feel. My friend has poor English skills and struggled with loneliness while in Canada due to the social differences between North America and Vietnam. The way we met was that she just came up to me at a party and started talking. Most people thought she was weird for doing that, when AFAIK that's a socially acceptable behaviour in Vietnam. She moved here at 16 without her parents and then had to support herself on her own at 18. She doesn't have other friends in Canada except for me and this community, and she seems much closer to them. She's currently living with her business partners. It bothers me because I believe she actually believed she would be helping me. It's hard to say for the rest of the team, especially since they were being transparent about their current financial situations and all seemed to be relatively vulnerable people who are being exploited by this company due to their lack of a support system and stressful life circumstances, but they've also gotten her to change her name. It's worth mentioning that she had never brought up partnering to me until I mentioned that I'd be in a situation where I'd need the support of a community. Right now I'm trying to just keep up regular contact with her so she has some company. I really regret letting us drift apart and putting her in a situation where she didn't have friends. I'm not going to bring up Amway since I don't want to risk her being pressured to not talk to me. She didn't try to guilt me or call me close minded when I said it wasn't for me. Any advice is welcome on this. I know that her getting out would require her getting a new place to live and finding a new community, but I don't know what to do. Especially when the MLM brings up many struggles in life like lack of job security when working for someone else, poor work life balance, and the rat race. I just hope that this community will at least be more successful in getting out since they have jobs and are getting college degrees in fields that are in demand like nursing and childcare.

Just moved to kirkland about a week ago. I had an amazing group of friends and gal pals. Im hoping to make friends here too. 

Some things about me:

I'm in my 30s, married. We are currently child-free and have a dog! He‚Äôs a corgi/collie mix üê∂.

I enjoy traveling; it's one of many hobbies I enjoy. I‚Äôve visited four countries so far, plus multiple regions of Mexico, and slowly making my way across the U.S., mainly eating along the way ü§≠.

I love cooking and hosting events like potlucks, picnics, dinner parties, movie and fun themed nights. Or even just having friends over for weeknight dinner, coffee and a chat! I‚Äôve added photos of some past get-togethers I‚Äôve organized. I like mixing up events so everyone can join, including spouses/partners, some women -only dates, and quality one-on-one friend time.

I can seem quiet and shy, but I'm getting better at socializing and getting out of my comfort zone to try new things. If you‚Äôre an extrovert please adopt me lol üòÜ .

I'm really into girly stuff like relaxing spa days, mani-pedis, massages, and brunching. I‚Äôm also down for any kind of events like happy hours, workouts, walks in the park, pumpkin patches, new restaurants, cheap eats, diners, drive-ins, dives, anime conventions, planner stuff, video games currently playing Disney light valley, movies in theaters or parks, community events , sports games, board games and puzzles, pool parties, museums, music shows, plays, etc. I have more free time now so I started listening to audiobooks so far ACOTR, ACOMF, hooked, zodiac academy: the awakening, just started fourth wing and then quicksilver will be next. 

Humor wise i would say a soft sailor lol üòÜ 

Anyways I don‚Äôt really know the vibe here or how people make friends in this area so if anyone has any helpful tips. Would be great. ",2,1734569178.0,Kirkland,0,0.75,False

I‚Äôve seen seeing my hair stylist for about 8-9 years now. From when she essentially just graduated to now owning her own salon and being pretty damn successful in our city/area. She has raised her prices throughout those 8-9 years (totally understandable) and now for a full highlight is about $500. In those 8-9 years I‚Äôve never once not shown up for an appointment, never once even been late, I‚Äôve maybe rescheduled one or two appts (but with ample time notice, never like next day or anything like that), and I always come with a coffee for her. I‚Äôve been incredibly loyal to her and haven‚Äôt seen anyone else during those 8-9 years, other than a few stylists at her salon if she became unavailable for some reason.  

Back in August I had an appt scheduled with her and I accidentally slept through it. I don‚Äôt even know how; it was scheduled for like 4pm and I left my office from work at like noon, was watching tv just until I needed to leave for my appt, and fell asleep, didn‚Äôt wake up until 2am. As soon as I woke up I texted her frantically at 2am apologizing profusely, telling her how sorry and how mortified I was. She read it the next morning and never responded. I decided to try to call the salon to reschedule, got voicemail, left a voicemail, never received a call back. Then the following day I saw she tried to charge my debit card on file for $495, the total for the appointment. I knew she would likely have some sort of cancellation fee but I didn‚Äôt realize it would be the full amount of the service, especially when the service wasn‚Äôt rendered. I always lock my debit card when not in use, so the charge didn‚Äôt go through. I figured I‚Äôd let her run the amount again when I was able to reschedule, but she never answered me and never called me back. 

I reached out to her last week after I decided to see a different stylist since she hadn‚Äôt been responding to me, because I don‚Äôt just consider her my hair stylist, I consider(ed) us friends. I told her I was sorry for asking for advice from a professional for free but was curious if she could suggest anything I could do to my hair to fix the botch job this new stylist did on me. She did finally respond to me and give me some suggestions, but spoke to me as if I were a total stranger, and in the message said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúI hope we can renew and repair our hair relationship‚Äù.  

I didn‚Äôt respond to her, but I did consider telling her how hurt I was that I‚Äôve been so loyal to her for nearly a decade and have never once even so much as been late let alone not shown up for an appt, and that I was hurt she couldn‚Äôt even so much as respond to me after I missed the appt, but I didn‚Äôt.  

Am I crazy here? I will accept if I am in the wrong here. I understand it‚Äôs wrong to just no show to a hair appointment, obviously. I‚Äôve never done that in my life to any stylist period. But I am only human and mistakes happen. I apologized profusely, tried to reach out in numerous ways‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not like I just no-showed and then never said a word. I have been an amazing client and have paid her thousands over the years for color, extensions, etc. I‚Äôve supported her in the opening of her salon, have sent good stylists her way to hire at her salon, have promoted her business on social media when I had tens of thousands of followers, have gone to concerts with her. Do stylists really give this little leeway to their loyal clientele? Not only that, but charging me for the full service that wasn‚Äôt even rendered also seems insane to me. A cancellation or no-show fee of like $100 or whatever? Sure, not a problem at all. But the full $500 for the service you didn‚Äôt even provide? That seems wild.

1hhgfhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mediums/comments/1hhgfhv/i_think_i_might_be_clairvoyant_or_something/,I think I might be clairvoyant or something?,"Hello. I never thought much about the things that have happened to me surrounding death or injury as anything other than coincidence. I do believe in the paranormal, spiritual, and the beyond, but I never thought it was anything more than my belief, versus experience.

When it comes to experiences, mine started around the age of 5, before I started school and was in daycare. I woke up one morning very early and was in a frantic state of mind as I kept telling my mom that my friend Jack was in danger; that something bad has happened to him. I also kept repeating the color red, although I do specific remember seeing a red slide, which if he got hurt playing on a red slide, then that made sense. My mom could not calm me. My mom took me to daycare a little early and once we got there, we were told that my friend Jack, who also went to this daycare, was in a bad car accident and a red car was involved (although I can't remember if it was the car they were in, or another car that was involved).

Another experience was when I was a little bit older and we had a neighbor across the street who would have to come over to where our block's mail boxes were, right in front of my house. Me and my mom were loading up in the car one day to leave, and as our neighbor came to the mailbox, I shouted out at her, ""Hi Pokey!!"" My mom thought this was very rude and had me apologize, but before I could, our neighbor came over with a shocked look on her face as she asked me where I'd heard that. I'm just a child, wasn't I just saying random stuff? But it turned out, that was her childhood nickname. Mind you, this was never once told to us, as we weren't really close to this woman.

Up until this point, nothing seemed to be too weird. I do believe that children are more open to the 3rd eye or whatever the right terminology is, and I just pawned the explanation on that.

The next experience I had that seemed very small at the time, but now looking back on it, I can't logically explain. I was 17 and it was Thanksgiving 2014. We had Friendsgiving since we didn't have any family near us anymore, since we moved 5 states away the year prior. The next day my boyfriend at the time, mom, and I went to Minot ND which was where the nearest mall to us was located, 2 hours away. We went shopping and as we were walking around the mall, I saw the LIDS store. I'd never once bought anything from this store, nor had I ever had anything custom made with anyone's name on it from any store to be specific. I had the most random idea to get my dog's name embroidered on a beanie. Her name was Coffee, so I also thought it would be pretty funny to have a hat with the name coffee on it in general. 2 days after I had this beanie made, my mom and I were at her school doing some work in her classroom (she's a teacher), and she stops us only about 30 minutes in to working which is odd since we usually spend a few hours at her school on the weekends. She sat me down and had told me that our neighbor from our hometown who had my dog, had called her that morning and told me some distressing news. My dog had actually passed away on Thanksgiving, which was 1 day before I got the beanie made, and 3 days before I found out. I always found this odd, and very coincidental, but maybe the universe was giving me a subtle hint?

Then we fast forward to 2018, when my GG (great grandma) passed away at the early hours of the morning, like around 2am. I don't normally have insomnia or troubles sleeping, like ever, I feel very blessed, but on this night I woke up at around the 2am hour and couldn't fall back asleep until almost 4am. I woke up sad, like I'd had one of those bad dreams that give you a weird unexplainable feeling when you wake up, but you never can remember what was in the dream. I found out about my GG I think the next day. That was a very small thing, but it still feels very weird.

A few months ago I lost my Great Aunt, who was actually GG's daughter. She's had cancer for years, but this summer she got very sick and was in the hospital where she found out she had a brain tumor. It was very severe and too far gone, so we knew she was going to die soon, just didn't know when. But a couple months after we found out about the tumor, I was running very early for my first appointment for work, and normally I wouldn't take myself out to a sit down restaurant and eat. Usually I'll grab a quick bite and sit in my car, but I decided to find a cute little diner and sit down for a couple of hours and enjoy breakfast with some Netflix. I was sitting at this small table that only fits 2; one on each side. When I was finished, I left to go to my appointment which was only 15 minutes away, and my mom calls me to tell me my aunt passed away a little while before, during the time that I was sitting across from an empty seat, where I believe she was sitting to enjoy some time with me before she moved on. Now this is all speculation of course, because I didn't feel anything weird or believe she was there, I just hope she was.

Now lastly, this one is the one that was the bottom of the iceberg that pushed me to post here; to find some outside opinions and thoughts.

Last Friday the 13th I started to have this HORRIBLE feeling. Like a gut wrenching, pit in my stomach, something bad is gonna happen, feeling. I couldn't shake it. I thought maybe I was about to start my time of the month, or the fact I might've been going stir crazy since I was home with a sick kid, but as the weekend persisted and my kid got better, the feeling still wouldn't shake. Well Monday comes around and my kid is better enough to go to school and I go to work. The afternoon rolls in and I feel the incredible urge to text my friend at 2:10pm and ask how she is. She didn't respond, so I just went on about my day. At around 3:30pm I got a call from my mother in law asking if I could pick up my kid, since she was supposed to, and she sounded concerned and told me she needed to go find her husband, who she has been separated from for over a year but has stayed friends with him. At 5pm I got a text from her asking me to go over to her house and hangout until she got home, to hangout with her son and wait for her to get home. On our way over there, I forgot the keys to their house so me and my kid had to turn around and walk back to our house to get them. On our way back, I saw a huge bird fly over our heads and land on the cables across the street from our apartment. It faced us, and once I got a good look at it, I noticed it was an owl. Out of every bird it could've been, an owl is what came out at barely 5:30pm on a Monday night. I thought it was so cool to see an owl for the first time in person out in the wild, so I took a video of it and we went and grabbed the keys and went about our way to my mother in laws. While we waited, my brother in law got a call from his boss who knew all of us and told him that he was sorry, and that's when we found out that my father in law was shot and passed away at 2:10pm. When I heard this news, that bad feeling I'd been having for 3 days at this point, slowly faded away.

My sister in law looked up what an owl could mean, and it's something to do with being a death omen. Not 100% sure on that, I didn't look it up at all.

I just had a shower and for the first time in about 8 years my skin doesn't feel like it's shrinking and isn't producing flakes.

I recently bought an MCT oil in a shop nearby after reading about it on this sub. I later discovered it contained C8, C10 and C12, but also read that it could still do more good than harm in spite of the C12.

I applied it directly to my skin after showers and noticed an immediate improvement, although slight. Itchy flakes behind my ears took longer to form, my back and chest rash took longer to appear. My nose didn't flake for hours. It was nice!

I also made sure I had 5ml daily (most days (when I remembered)), in coffee, in porridge for breakfast etc.

However, I added a water filter to my shower hose and today is my first time using it. I applied the oil after and right now I have zero tightness, zero flakes!

This is not product affiliation, I'm just sharing how happy I am after trying everything for years. Hopefully, hard water is my catalyst. If it is, this could be huge for me.

I guess I want people to know, you never know what's around the corner. If you feel self conscious about your flakes, if you itch and feel awful as a result of your sebderm, you never know what will happen with the next thing you try! ",1,1734568276.0,SebDerm,1,1.0,False

One for a secret Santa for work. The coworker didn't give a whole lot of ideas. Other than getting a $25 gift card to Target or her favorite coffee place, I'm at a loss. I wanted to do something a little more fun. She's not a reader, didn't put down any hobbies. I don't know her very well either. I have a milk frother and thought I'd get some flavored coffee syrups but I'm not a coffee drinker and don't even know if you'd 'froth' coffee with those syrups? Should I just go with the gift card?

The other one is a family one. Same spending limit of $25. Last year I gave a Stanely Cup, which was a big deal then, so that went over well, and my teenage niece got it, which I was glad because she was afraid to pick the bag because it looked like it could be a bottle of booze. lol. I kind of nudged her and said it was safe. However, I don't know of anything that's big this year and I like to get something that is gender neutral, so, at least in our family, that excludes make-up, lotions, etc. 

What I bought so far, which I was looking at for myself, but then thought, oh, this would be so cool for the white elephant! And it was exactly the right price, was a whetstone. The box is nice. But now I'm thinking this is dumb. Who's going to want something to sharpen knives???

1hhg7gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1hhg7gq/twin_peaks_as_an_amusement_park_ride/,Twin Peaks as an amusement park ride‚Ä¶ ,"Okay so today I was at Universal Orlando, and just happened to rewatch Twin Peaks recently and I was thinking to myself, what would Twin Peaks as a ride look like, I asked ChatGPT and I was not let down and now I wish it was real. Anyways, just wanted to share, here‚Äôs the concept: 

Ride Concept: ""The Black Lodge Experience""
The ride would be a dark, immersive journey into the mysterious world of Twin Peaks, taking guests through iconic locations such as the Black Lodge, the Red Room, and the creepy woods surrounding the town.

2. Queue Line:
Theme: The queue would take visitors through a fog-filled, dimly lit forest that evokes the atmosphere of the eerie woods. The iconic ""Welcome to Twin Peaks"" sign would be visible in the distance, but partially obscured by fog and shadow.
Interactive Elements: The queue could have hidden speakers playing distorted, eerie sounds‚Äîlike the murmurs of characters or distorted quotes from the show. Some areas might have flickering lights, and guests might see shadowy figures darting past the trees.
Set Design: The queue could feature iconic images from the show, such as the ""Log Lady,"" the White and Black Lodge doors, or even a replica of the sheriff's office.
3. Ride Vehicles: ""The Red Room Chairs""
Design: Riders would sit in vehicles styled like the iconic red chairs from the Red Room. These could be individual pods or smaller groups of seats, each suspended from a track.
Movement: The ride would be a mix of dark ride (slow-moving) and roller coaster elements, with sudden drops and twists representing the disorienting nature of the show's alternate realities. The vehicles could even rotate or tilt in a way that makes the riders feel like they're traveling between dimensions.
4. Key Ride Sections:
a. Entering the Black Lodge:

The first part of the ride would be a slow crawl through the eerie woods and a dark tunnel representing the gateway to the Black Lodge. Flickering lights and distorted whispers fill the air, and riders would see images of characters like Laura Palmer, Dale Cooper, and BOB, each emerging from the darkness in disorienting, hallucinatory ways.
b. The Red Room:

Riders would enter a completely red-lit, mirrored environment resembling the Red Room with its black-and-white zigzag floor. There would be subtle movement of furniture, like chairs floating or rotating, creating the illusion that the room itself is alive and shifting. Characters like the Man from Another Place, with his surreal dance moves, could appear to interact with riders.
c. The Spirits of Twin Peaks:

The next section could involve a rapid series of twists and drops as the ride takes visitors through a distorted version of the town of Twin Peaks. Guests might pass through the Double R Diner (with a scene of Norma serving coffee), the sheriff‚Äôs station, and the infamous ""Welcome to Twin Peaks"" sign, all in a rapidly changing, surreal form, blurring the lines between reality and the supernatural.
d. The Woods and BOB:

This part of the ride would become more intense. The ride vehicles could be launched into the woods, with trees flashing by and BOB's unsettling laughter echoing in the distance. Sudden, unexpected drops and quick turns would make it feel like the woods are closing in on the riders.
e. The Final Confrontation:

Riders would enter a final showdown in the Black Lodge, where they must face the darkness. This could involve an exciting, yet terrifying drop or a reverse coaster element, where guests are momentarily launched backward into the depths of the Lodge. The Red Room would pulse with ominous music as the ride reaches its climax.
f. Exit through the Mist:

The ride would conclude with a disorienting descent back into the misty woods, where the sounds of the forest fade, and guests would exit to an eerie, fog-filled area. As they leave, distorted, final whispers of characters like Laura Palmer (""I'll see you again in 25 years"") would linger, leaving an unsettling sense of mystery.
5. Soundtrack & Effects:
The ride would feature the signature eerie soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti, using dissonant, atmospheric music and sharp, discordant sounds to create tension.
Sudden loud noises, echoes, and whispers from the show could add to the unnerving atmosphere.
Effects like flashing lights, sudden wind, and strange projections (e.g., BOB‚Äôs face emerging from the walls) would heighten the sensory overload.
6. Themed Merchandising:
As guests exit, they could visit a shop with Twin Peaks merchandise, offering things like Log Lady figurines, mugs with Laura Palmer's image, and even ""cherry pie"" (in reference to the show's famous food items).
This ride would be a blend of haunting visuals, psychological thrills, and the sense of disorientation that defines Twin Peaks. It would be an immersive experience that captures the dreamlike, twisted nature of the show.",1,1734568030.0,twinpeaks,2,0.6,False

I expect to get approximately $5k in the summer from FA loans, and then in fall and spring I should get just under $10k (each). This is the maximum I‚Äôm allowed to borrow with FAFSA and I cannot borrow any additional private loans. This is the full loan allotment, so once my tuition, books, fees, etc is withdrawn, I will likely have nothing in the summer and approximately $4k per semester to live on. We are expected to work 40-45 hours per week in the DI as well as take an additional course in fall and spring, so we are told we cannot work so that we can focus on the DI and courses.

I have 4 kids, who will range from 15 down to 7 when the DI starts. While their father is a fantastic support person and is their primary caretaker while I am finishing up, I do still have financial responsibilities as a parent to them in addition to my own basic living needs. I have a partner, but he does not make enough to support us both for a year; as it stands, I already make more than he does as a GA and gig worker and I am still feel like I am constantly scrambling for money. I contribute (and thus will need to make up) $3k per month, not including anything extra like special occasions like birthdays and Christmas. We live in a very low COL area (median income is under $30k and a much larger than average percentage of people live below the poverty line), so him just being able to get a better paying job to support me is almost certainly not happening. We do not live a luxurious life, we are already at ‚ÄúI visit multiple food banks per month‚Äù living, so it‚Äôs not like we have much to cut out. The only subscription we have is Netflix which his mom pays half of, we only get coffee if we get gift cards, we eat eggs and rice or some similar variation like 4 nights a week because it‚Äôs cheap, we only have one car to share, etc etc etc. 

I do still plan to do gig work, but at best I may make $1k per month if I don‚Äôt want to let school and sleep suffer and if I still want to see my kids on occasion (which obviously, I do). That is really at best, so realistically it will likely be closer to $500-750 a month. Combined with the leftover FA money, I will likely still need to come up with at least $1500 more per month, assuming no emergencies pop up (I planned to save my FA money this semester and next, but my mouth decided to crap out and I needed so much dental work it tapped out everything I had saved and I have more scheduled for next semester).

How are people making it through their DI without working for a year? I know many people are younger and thus may live at home or have parental support, and others may have a partner with a large enough income to help them make it, but I know I certainly can‚Äôt be the only one who is in this situation. I don‚Äôt expect free money or tons of money for very little work, but I just don‚Äôt see how I can make up $1.5-$2k per month for a year without working an additional 20-30hrs a week. Because I also needed to take out loans for undergrad in addition to this year, I cannot take time off to work and save up, as my loans will go into repayment, which I can‚Äôt afford.

1. 'Kingdom message would experience unstoppable growth' and 'would have success' 

2. ""The Master of the harvest continues to see potential in the field, so we have good reason to keep preaching.""

This Reddit post from 3 months ago shows the exact opposite is happening.
https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1fg3fpp/are_jehovahs_witnesses_increasingdecreasing_were/

""Is the preaching work speeding up? For years Witnesses have quoted the scripture at Isaiah 60:22 ""The little one will become a thousand. And the small one a mighty nation. I myself, Jehovah, will speed it up in its own time.‚Äù They apply this to expanding preaching work and increasing members during the ""last days"". 

The reality is the preaching work has been slowing down for decades.

From 1980 to 2023, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses grew from about 2.2 million to 8.5 million, with growth rates averaging 5-7% in the 1980s, 3-5% in the 1990s, 2-3% in the 2000s, and 1-2% in the 2010s and beyond.""

If we were to look at the more recent developments like lack of counting hours and only a tickbox being required to count as an active publishers we can clearly see that the preaching work has slowed down considerably.

I mean why do we even need to prove this, when you only have to look at your own congregation, empty groups and people just coming to spend time writing letters or going on coffee breaks.

Stop fooling yourself - THE MINISTRY IS DEAD!

And yet, here they are printing articles about 'remaining positive', 'zealously preaching' or 'being spurred to preach with a sense of urgency.""",2,1734567730.0,exjw,1,1.0,False

### Devotional: Hearts Open Wide: Embracing Our Neighbors in a World of Change

**Scripture Reading: Luke 10:25-37 (The Parable of the Good Samaritan)**

**Reflection:**  
In a world that is constantly changing, filled with uncertainties and challenges, the call to open our hearts wide and embrace our neighbors has never been more urgent. The Parable of the Good Samaritan presents us with a profound example of love in action, illustrating what it means to be a good neighbor. A Samaritan, often marginalized by society, demonstrates compassion toward a wounded man left by the roadside, reminding us that our responses to those in need should transcend societal divisions, prejudices, and fears.

Today, many individuals face changes that can isolate them‚Äînew immigrants, the elderly, those experiencing job loss, or families affected by recent events. As followers of Christ, we are called to not only recognize these changes but to proactively embrace our neighbors who are navigating this landscape alongside us.

**Educational Insight:**  
According to social scientists, the act of embracing our neighbors isn‚Äôt just a moral obligation‚Äîit‚Äôs crucial for building empathy and cohesion in our communities. Research shows that when we engage with diverse groups, we cultivate understanding and erode barriers of fear and stereotypes. In other words, yes, our hearts should be open wide, but so too should our arms be ready for that hug of support, whether it‚Äôs emotional, physical, or financial.

**Encouragement:**  
Consider where you are called to serve today. Who in your community might be feeling the weight of change? Perhaps it‚Äôs a neighbor in need of a friendly conversation, a co-worker facing transition, or a family who feels uprooted in their current circumstances. Opening our hearts and homes to them doesn‚Äôt require grand gestures. Sometimes, the simplest acts‚Äîa listening ear, a shared meal, or an offer of help‚Äîcan leave a lasting impact.

In the face of change, let us remember that we do not embrace our neighbors alone. God‚Äôs presence goes before us. He equips us with the love, courage, and wisdom needed to reach out. As we extend our hands and hearts, we embody Christ‚Äôs love in a tangible way: ‚ÄúFor I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in‚Äù (Matthew 25:35).

**Prayer:**  
Heavenly Father, grant us the grace to open our hearts wide to those around us, especially when the world feels unfamiliar and fear takes hold. Help us recognize your face in every neighbor we meet, and inspire us to act with kindness and compassion, just as the Good Samaritan did. May our actions reflect Your love and may we forge deeper connections that bridge divides. Let us stand firm in the truth that love is a powerful force for change in our communities. Amen.

**Action Step:**  
This week, take a moment to identify one neighbor or community member who could use support. Reach out with a small gesture‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs an invitation to coffee, offering assistance with a task, or simply checking in. Let this be a practice of embracing our neighbors, for in giving, we receive the blessing of community.

Welcome to December! 

We have reached the last month of 2024. 

Time has lost all meaning. Some months have gone so slow its felt like an entire year, and other times they have rushed by so fast I missed 3/4th‚Äôs of it, and theres no accounting for what sort of day each day is gonna be. 
But I love December. I love the holidays and snow when we get it, and how everything is just a little bit quieter. 

Do you like a cup of coffee on a dark morning? Do sit under the stars with a blanket and some hot cocoa? Or do you cross your fingers and hope the winter passes quick so we can get to the summer months again?


FYI: The deadline has changed for this feature.  Since there is no campfire, yall have the full month to write your poems. Hope this helps!

***

Let‚Äôs face it: poetry is a strange land for many of us. What makes a poem? Does it have to rhyme? Follow a structure and meter? Does it have to be based in emotion? All these are great questions. Poetry comes in all forms and styles, rhyming and non-rhyming, metered and freeform. Some poems even tell a fictional story, like prose does!  Some poems don't use any line breaks at all, and Prose-Poems can be tricky yet effective.

Each month, I provide you with a simple theme and an additional constraint to inspire you. You have 60 - 350 words to write a poem based on that theme.

#This Month‚Äôs Challenge

**Theme:**  Luminescence

[**IP 1**](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/5XmQqz)  | [**IP 2**](https://www.deviantart.com/pndora/art/Luminescent-Reverie-1015219797)  | [**MP**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMAzstG5O7E)    
   
**Bonus Constraints:** 

* Lean into speculative elements


**Luminescense**:  the emission of light by a substance that has not been heated, as in fluorescence and phosphorescence.  a spontaneous emission of radiation from an electronically or vibrationally excited species not in thermal equilibrium with its environment. 

A soft, cool light.

Is it the earth‚Äîthe fish and mushrooms and sun and moon‚Äì that glows? Is it the life inside someone elses eyes? Is it supernatural or entirely ordinary? 

You‚Äôll have to tell me. 

**Need some help with speculative fiction and spec poetry?** *I got you!*     


Speculative Fiction: the term encompasses works in which the setting is other than the real world, involving supernatural, futuristic, or other imagined elements. It‚Äôs fairies and dragons. It‚Äôs imagined science in the future. It‚Äôs werewolves, and vampires, and atlantis and time travel and magic, and everything else that doesn‚Äôt quite exist in our reality. 

This goes for both prose and poetry. You‚Äôll find the poems a lot heavier on the metaphors, usually, but they still lean into things being not quite the way they seem. 

Examples: 


[Mirrors by Millie Ho](https://www.uncannymagazine.com/article/mirrors/)

[syzygy by Roshani Chokshi ](https://www.uncannymagazine.com/article/syzygy/)

[The Universe is Dying by Michelle Koubek](http://strangehorizons.com/poetry/the-universe-is-dying/)

That holds me in almost every aspects in life like in my career my social life and everything. I started to hate myself and give up on everything one by one. I am always but always the worst in the room and not used to that feeling. Not sure what I am doing wrong or if I am completely wrong... Just wondering if anybody else you know have a similar struggle or not. Thanks in advance.",3,1734567463.0,languagelearning,5,0.8,False

1hhfz4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1hhfz4k/my_gerddysphagiaeoe_journey/,MY Gerd/dysphagia/EoE journey,"I‚Äôm 29 years old male I weigh 175lbs I‚Äôm 5ft 11in tall very active. Love to play basketball. I own and operate a full service tree service. I use to love to drink energy drinks and coffee and eat whatever I wanted whenever I wanted. Until November of 2023‚Ä¶.
So my journey began November of 2023‚Ä¶ I was in my kitchen and had unthawed some smoked chicken and threw it in the microwave. I took it out and put decent size pinch of it in my mouth, chewed it up and‚Ä¶.. it felt stuck‚Ä¶ took a small drink of water and that make it worse I went into a panic attack thinking I couldn‚Äôt breathe and the water basically filled it all the little gaps and instead of going down it made an impaction. I was about to cough it up finally. Scared me to death I thought I was dying. Life went on and every now and again I would get that same sensation mostly with meats but I had it happen with several things. Even Mac-N-Cheese. 
March of this year ‚Äú2024‚Äù we welcome our
newborn into the world! I knew I had to get this under control because it was ruining my mental health. I had a visit with my doctor and he prescribed me omeprazole 40mg once a day for what he believed was silent reflux and also some anxiety medication. I didn‚Äôt take the omeprazole routinely as the bottle said at first because i honestly didn‚Äôt believe I had any type of reflux because I never had a burning sensation in my chest, never had any reflux at all unless I ate a ton of junk food and deep-fried food. In that case I would wake up with a burning acidity sensation in my throat‚Ä¶ I would drink a small glass of milk and it would be gone. This was only was in a blue moon that this would happen. I couldn‚Äôt handle the anxiety meds because they made me feel like I had the flu
June- I underwent the procedures and when I woke up that‚Äôs when my life changed. During the Endoscopy they found a size 4mm hiatial hernia, Shatzki ring also known as a stricture or narrowing. Mine was a ring like structure closer to my LES- ‚Äú Lower Esophageal Sphincter‚Äù.  They Made vertical incisions in the ring and then dilated my esophagus to 20mm and then gave me a steroid shot in my esophagus to prevent stenosis. They took biopsies of my esophagus and sent them off. While performing all of this my esophagus was very red and irritated. Onto the colonoscopy.. everything came back clear for the most part other than internal hemroids that they weren‚Äôt too concerned with because they weren‚Äôt very big and a polyp that was non cancerous. 
After waking up from the procedure they told me everything that went on and told me I could return to a normal diet‚Ä¶. So I did. 
On my way home from the hospital we stopped and got Captain D‚Äôs. I had a two piece fish dinner. No issues eating everything went down. I went home took a nap because I was out of it due to the anesthesia. When I woke up we had chicken Alfredo‚Ä¶ this is where it all started. Third bite in I felt my food get stuck but I was able to wash it down with water. I had developed these weird burps as well that felt like trapped air that I couldnt hardly get out. It sent an adrenaline rush to my chest and my face. My heart rate was all out of whack. This caused a panic attack. I had a nurse friend I called that was able to keep me calm and I ended up going to bed and sleeping it off hoping everything was just irritated from the procedure. The next weeks to come I couldn‚Äôt hardly swallow anything. It was like where they had done the procedure and cut into me had gotten swollen and almost swelled shut. I lost almost 20 pounds in 2 weeks. They couldn‚Äôt figure out what was going on so they just upped my dose of omeprazole to 40mg twice a day with taking carafate every 4-6hrs. This just made me feel worse. I felt sick all the time. I just wanted to sleep and didn‚Äôt have any energy. I was worried I was about to starve to death from a procedure I thought was going to be simple and my life would return to normal. My biopsy‚Äôs had come back but they messed them up somehow??
I I believe it was about a week after not being able to eat anything other than protein shakes and even that I had to just sip it because I would choke, I went up to OSU Medical center and they admitted me and told me the GI doc wanted to see me in the morning. So I stayed. The next morning the GI doc comes in and says ‚Äú hey I looked over everything and I reviewed your recent procedure and we agree with everything that‚Äôs been done. You‚Äôre free to go whenever you‚Äôd like. ‚Äú I said look I just stayed the night so I could get some answers‚Ä¶ is there anything we can do or test we can run to see what‚Äôs going on. They done a barium swallow test. Everything looked normal aside from when they had me swallow the barium pill and it stopped right where the shatzki ring was located. That wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen. The ring should‚Äôve dropped down into my stomach. They said it was more than likely still inflammation due to acid reflux. Also my results from the biopsy of the esophagus came back and there was some kind of 
July-my GP took me off omeprazole and put me on one 20mg vaquenza a day. Very strong anti acid medication. Im still dealing with the weird burping of what feels like trapped air. Still feeling everything I eat and drink as it goes down. Making a little progress. At this point I can eat eggs, I would cook them over easy and dice them up as fine as I could. I did this majority of the month of July and into August. 
August- still dealing with all the same symptoms for the most part but slowly adding in softer foods and chewing everything extremely well and taking small bites. Have to wash every bite down with a drink. I was starting to add my energy drinks back in as I didn‚Äôt know if they were the culprit or not. Towards the end of August I had a set back and chocked of food again. I quit drinking caffeine all together. Wasn‚Äôt sure if it was causing my set backs. 
September- I was having some side effects with the Voquenza which was stomach pain. 
I started taking omeprazole 40mg twice a day again. Toward the end of September I lowered my dose down to one 40mg a day. And started to notice a difference. Was finally able to eat some stuff. I had to chew it up good but I didn‚Äôt feel it going down as much as I had before. 
October - I had to have another endoscopy to see how everything was healing up from my procedure. My throat wasn‚Äôt irritated anymore but the area where he performed the procedure on my shatzki ring was still kind of swollen and irritated. They sent off biopsies again to make sure I didn‚Äôt have EoE ‚Äúwhich came back that I didn‚Äôt have‚Äù. 
That was a huge relief.  Oct7th I ended up getting mono was sick thru November. 
I started second guessing all of the omeprazole  wondering if it was causing my body not to be able to fight off certain things. So I lowered my dose to 20mg a day. 
I‚Äôm now feeling better and healed from mono but starting to be able to feel some of my food as it goes down. I also still deal with the weird burps. I call them deer burps because it sounds like a deer grunt. But they‚Äôre painful. I just want my life back if possible or to know how to cope with this. I did learn that the pain in my stomach I was dealing with due to PPI‚Äôs is from constipation. I‚Äôm considering trying a different PPI or talking with my GP about seeing what I can do with this hiatal hernia if it‚Äôs the culprit.  What do you guys think? Have any of you had a similar experience?

1hhfxwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/EosinophilicE/comments/1hhfxwp/eoedysphagiagerd_journey/,EoE/Dysphagia/Gerd journey," I‚Äôm 29 years old male I weigh 175lbs I‚Äôm 5ft 11in tall very active. Love to play basketball. I own and operate a full service tree service. I use to love to drink energy drinks and coffee and eat whatever I wanted whenever I wanted. Until November of 2023‚Ä¶.
So my journey began November of 2023‚Ä¶ I was in my kitchen and had unthawed some smoked chicken and threw it in the microwave. I took it out and put decent size pinch of it in my mouth, chewed it up and‚Ä¶.. it felt stuck‚Ä¶ took a small drink of water and that make it worse I went into a panic attack thinking I couldn‚Äôt breathe and the water basically filled it all the little gaps and instead of going down it made an impaction. I was about to cough it up finally. Scared me to death I thought I was dying. Life went on and every now and again I would get that same sensation mostly with meats but I had it happen with several things. Even Mac-N-Cheese. 
March of this year ‚Äú2024‚Äù we welcome our
newborn into the world! I knew I had to get this under control because it was ruining my mental health. I had a visit with my doctor and he prescribed me omeprazole 40mg once a day for what he believed was silent reflux and also some anxiety medication. I didn‚Äôt take the omeprazole routinely as the bottle said at first because i honestly didn‚Äôt believe I had any type of reflux because I never had a burning sensation in my chest, never had any reflux at all unless I ate a ton of junk food and deep-fried food. In that case I would wake up with a burning acidity sensation in my throat‚Ä¶ I would drink a small glass of milk and it would be gone. This was only was in a blue moon that this would happen. I couldn‚Äôt handle the anxiety meds because they made me feel like I had the flu
June- I underwent the procedures and when I woke up that‚Äôs when my life changed. During the Endoscopy they found a size 4mm hiatial hernia, Shatzki ring also known as a stricture or narrowing. Mine was a ring like structure closer to my LES- ‚Äú Lower Esophageal Sphincter‚Äù.  They Made vertical incisions in the ring and then dilated my esophagus to 20mm and then gave me a steroid shot in my esophagus to prevent stenosis. They took biopsies of my esophagus and sent them off. While performing all of this my esophagus was very red and irritated. Onto the colonoscopy.. everything came back clear for the most part other than internal hemroids that they weren‚Äôt too concerned with because they weren‚Äôt very big and a polyp that was non cancerous. 
After waking up from the procedure they told me everything that went on and told me I could return to a normal diet‚Ä¶. So I did. 
On my way home from the hospital we stopped and got Captain D‚Äôs. I had a two piece fish dinner. No issues eating everything went down. I went home took a nap because I was out of it due to the anesthesia. When I woke up we had chicken Alfredo‚Ä¶ this is where it all started. Third bite in I felt my food get stuck but I was able to wash it down with water. I had developed these weird burps as well that felt like trapped air that I couldnt hardly get out. It sent an adrenaline rush to my chest and my face. My heart rate was all out of whack. This caused a panic attack. I had a nurse friend I called that was able to keep me calm and I ended up going to bed and sleeping it off hoping everything was just irritated from the procedure. The next weeks to come I couldn‚Äôt hardly swallow anything. It was like where they had done the procedure and cut into me had gotten swollen and almost swelled shut. I lost almost 20 pounds in 2 weeks. They couldn‚Äôt figure out what was going on so they just upped my dose of omeprazole to 40mg twice a day with taking carafate every 4-6hrs. This just made me feel worse. I felt sick all the time. I just wanted to sleep and didn‚Äôt have any energy. I was worried I was about to starve to death from a procedure I thought was going to be simple and my life would return to normal. My biopsy‚Äôs had come back but they messed them up somehow??
I I believe it was about a week after not being able to eat anything other than protein shakes and even that I had to just sip it because I would choke, I went up to OSU Medical center and they admitted me and told me the GI doc wanted to see me in the morning. So I stayed. The next morning the GI doc comes in and says ‚Äú hey I looked over everything and I reviewed your recent procedure and we agree with everything that‚Äôs been done. You‚Äôre free to go whenever you‚Äôd like. ‚Äú I said look I just stayed the night so I could get some answers‚Ä¶ is there anything we can do or test we can run to see what‚Äôs going on. They done a barium swallow test. Everything looked normal aside from when they had me swallow the barium pill and it stopped right where the shatzki ring was located. That wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen. The ring should‚Äôve dropped down into my stomach. They said it was more than likely still inflammation due to acid reflux. Also my results from the biopsy of the esophagus came back and there was some kind of 
July-my GP took me off omeprazole and put me on one 20mg vaquenza a day. Very strong anti acid medication. Im still dealing with the weird burping of what feels like trapped air. Still feeling everything I eat and drink as it goes down. Making a little progress. At this point I can eat eggs, I would cook them over easy and dice them up as fine as I could. I did this majority of the month of July and into August. 
August- still dealing with all the same symptoms for the most part but slowly adding in softer foods and chewing everything extremely well and taking small bites. Have to wash every bite down with a drink. I was starting to add my energy drinks back in as I didn‚Äôt know if they were the culprit or not. Towards the end of August I had a set back and chocked of food again. I quit drinking caffeine all together. Wasn‚Äôt sure if it was causing my set backs. 
September- I was having some side effects with the Voquenza which was stomach pain. 
I started taking omeprazole 40mg twice a day again. Toward the end of September I lowered my dose down to one 40mg a day. And started to notice a difference. Was finally able to eat some stuff. I had to chew it up good but I didn‚Äôt feel it going down as much as I had before. 
October - I had to have another endoscopy to see how everything was healing up from my procedure. My throat wasn‚Äôt irritated anymore but the area where he performed the procedure on my shatzki ring was still kind of swollen and irritated. They sent off biopsies again to make sure I didn‚Äôt have EoE ‚Äúwhich came back that I didn‚Äôt have‚Äù. 
That was a huge relief.  Oct7th I ended up getting mono was sick thru November. 
I started second guessing all of the omeprazole  wondering if it was causing my body not to be able to fight off certain things. So I lowered my dose to 20mg a day. 
I‚Äôm now feeling better and healed from mono but starting to be able to feel some of my food as it goes down. I also still deal with the weird burps. I call them deer burps because it sounds like a deer grunt. But they‚Äôre painful. I just want my life back if possible or to know how to cope with this. I did learn that the pain in my stomach I was dealing with due to PPI‚Äôs is from constipation. I‚Äôm considering trying a different PPI or talking with my GP about seeing what I can do with this hiatal hernia if it‚Äôs the culprit.  What do you guys think? Have any of you had a similar experience? Also one thing I forgot to mention the findings of my biopsy of my esophagus in June came back as a mild case of EoE. Then the biopsy in October showed no Eoe. Very confusing.

1hhfvka,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/1hhfvka/want_to_upgrade_from_my_old_baratza_encore/,Want to upgrade from my old Baratza Encore,"Hi all

I've been using an Encore for maybe 10 years now. I've probably run 50-100 pounds of coffee through it in that time? I'm not sure. But I drink more coffee than ever the past few years - so that number will be rising at a faster rate in the next few years.

I've been cold brewing in one of the simple containers that have a screw-in meshy filter thing in the center. Nothing fancy at all. (I have a Jarva on order to just make my workflow smoother, but UPS has been sitting on the package for a while)

Sometimes I drink it right out of that, which gives me a gritty coffee due to the fines the Encore gives. Other times, I run it through a paper filter of whatever brand I could get cheaply, but the amount of fines tend to clog those up really quickly and it can take an hour to filter even with agitation.

I know a lot of you use and recommend the Encore, but personally, I'm ready for an upgrade. I've been looking at lots of options, but it's a little annoying that a lot of good grinders these days are for single dose. I get why. But I brew 2 quarts at a time, occasionally even will do two 2-quart containers, so a gallon. Single dose grinders make that annoying to have to grind in a bunch of batches.

I also prefer to get something quieter - or at least not louder - than the Encore. And not something with potential reliability issues. So the Sette ones are out on both of those counts. Several other Baratzas are out on volume. In fact let's just say I'm not a fan of Baratza.

Maybe the Eureka Brew Pro?

Or maybe I go even higher end, open up more options to do even more types of brewing (and espresso?), or otherwise just allow for a grinder to make me do multiple batches?

Something like a Mazzer Philos (to ""eventually"" get into espresso), or an Ode 2 (no espresso, but good grind for drip, quiet, compact, good price). Either would make me grind in several batches (or would make me need to get creative and add like a 3d printed larger hopper or something). The Philos might be louder than the Encore - I'm not sure.

1hhfum1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hhfum1/i_miss_my_great_grandma/,I miss my great grandma,"This isn‚Äôt really a big, controversial thing, but I miss my grandmama. I know that I was lucky to have her in my life for sixteen years, and even though she‚Äôs been dead for eight I still sometimes wonder what she would think if she saw me now as the fuckup I‚Äôve become. My extended family is all very close, so I grew up going to her house after school where she would watch us. She would feed us chocolates and homemade meals (while she still could when we were quite young), then turn on her soaps and insist that they were the greatest shows she‚Äôd seen. I‚Äôd always laugh at them, even when I was a kid, because they were ‚Äòstupid‚Äô and ‚Äòboring‚Äô. I wish so badly that I could go back and watch them with her again. 

I wish I could sit on her floral couch that didn‚Äôt match her living room at all and just enjoy them with her. I wish I could beg her for more Vienna cookies even though I know my mom would‚Äôve been mad at me for ruining my dinner. I wish she would be there on sauce canning day, sitting to the side, while her two children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren worked and argued about the tomatoes. I wish I could sit on the couch and ask her more about her life. About her family before my grandma and uncle were born. About the traditions she vehemently insisted on passing down and refused to change. I wish I hadn‚Äôt called her old, even though she was well into her 90s. I wish I could hear her tell stories about papa, who died when I was one. I wish she could still spend Christmas with us, nitpicking as my grandma cooks us dinner. I wish I could hear her drop something or spill something and say ‚Äòoh shit‚Äô again (her catchphrase). I miss seeing her eat all the fish dishes on holidays because all she basically lived on was chocolate and coffee. 

I wish other people knew the kind of person she was. I know she wasn‚Äôt famous or anything but I wish people knew about her because she was everything to me. She was born in 1920 to an Italian immigrant and a first gen Italian-American, and kept their traditions alive in our family until she passed. She met my papa at a school dance, where he told her he was going to marry her and she laughed in his face. She was always a quick-witted, sassy, and fiery individual. She graduated high school‚Äî the second in her immediate family to do so after her sister. When my papa was drafted into the war, she worked in a factory. She had my grandma near the end of the conflict and her brother soon after. She was extremely close with her older sister, who died of cancer very young. The entire family: her own, her mother, her cousins, aunts, and uncles all lived on various floors of the same house and were all extremely close. When her sister died, she and the others took turns raising her children. They made sure the kids‚Äô father was able to work while also allowing them to live in an area with a better school. She loved her sister dearly, and I can only imagine how difficult it was to lose her. 

When her grandkids were born (my mother included) she spoiled them rotten, telling them ‚Äòit‚Äôs okay to be spoiled as long as you‚Äôre not a brat‚Äô. She did the same for us great grandchildren when we came around. In 2001, she lost my papa‚Äî the love of her life‚Äî to dementia. She kept his drawers in their room untouched until the day she died. My papa used to send back coins from Panama during the war‚Äî coins from all around the world so that my grandmama, grandma, and uncle would enjoy. She gave them to us great grandkids when we asked‚Äî something I know must have been heartbreaking to do. Up until she was hospitalized she attended all of our events: softball games, winter concerts, musicals, graduations, etc. She was always there. She would tell us how proud she was of us. Before she died, when visiting her in the hospital, we brought her favourite doughnuts from a local bakery and it will forever kill me that she couldn‚Äôt properly enjoy them. When she passed, I got a few things to keep of hers but my most cherished item was a blanket my family had gotten her. It wasn‚Äôt anything special‚Äî something we bought her for Christmas as bath and body works‚Äî but I will cherish it forever. 

She was also the classiest woman you‚Äôd have ever met. She always made sure her outfit and makeup were meticulous‚Äî my grandma would get up early every day as she got older to help her do her makeup and hair. She always dressed to the nines no matter the occasion and even in her old age. She dyed it this garish orange-red color that I now dearly miss.

I miss her so much and wish I could just hug her one more time. She was the glue of our family and it has never been the same since she passed on. I know this is a stupid thing to post here, but I feel like I have no one else to talk to about her.",1,1734567038.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

My manager is great (F40) she‚Äôs the same ethnicity as I am (for context later) she‚Äôs great at hiring people and she‚Äôs great with being a manager overall. For the past 2 years i did not have any problems with the company at all or even with my manager.

Then my manager laughs out of nowhere, me confused making eye contact to my manager what so funny, she told me that the name of the customer translates to fat ass in our language. She kept laughing and told her that it was inappropriate (spoke to my manager in our language so the customer wont know that she was the one being laughed at). She ignored me and proceeded to do her work like nothing happened at all.  For the next shift i had less hours than my regular schedule, I was thinking that maybe my manager had reduced it due to calling her out. I didnt say anything or whatever. I was in school anyways and didnt really needed extra hours. Another shift - i was in drive thru and my manager began laughing again, and I was like what now? Then she told me in our language again that i sound drunk whenever I take the customers order. That made me feel so insecure, knowing that my English is my second language and i have been staying here in North America for 10 years now. I asked my co workers if i did sound drunk whenever I‚Äôm taking orders and reassured me I wasnt. Few months fast forward i heard one of my shift supervisor crying at the back. She told me that they were being investigated for theft. And my manager is also being investigated for being the master mind for encouraging a culture where employees are comfortable stealing from the homeless and the company. During closing shifts our shift supervisor depends who it is, would give us free pastries for our hardwork and especially when we had to stay longer hours for cleaning. It wasnt always but only when we had to stay pass our scheduled hours. But those pastries and sandwiches that are done for the night are supposed to go for donations for the homeless.

We didn‚Äôt know who reported it but apparently a regular customer of ours went to another location and told one of the workers there that her son goes to our location because we give out free food. Then this worker spread out what the regular customer had said to their whole store and it reached HR.  Mind you we were giving out samples not a whole ass sandwich or pastry. So there was a miscommunication there. During the investigation, HR people were interviewing us, and my manager was unsending messages in their group chat that contained her messages detailing when and which worker can be given free food. My manager was crying for days because theft is grounds for termination, there were also gossips about her not hiring certain ethnicities because they are hard to work with , guess which ethnicity it is.

Over the years I have recorded all of the herbs and formulas that have had a tremendous impact in this regard.  
  
Below I list out the easiest ones for you to get your hands on (Nothing too exotic).And I‚Äôll spare you explanations of all of the talk about mechanisms and how they work, unless you ask :)  
  
I am selling none of this, do not buy any of this from me, all of this is easily available.   
  
If you hit me up for links I‚Äôm just going to send you stores from google search.If you are a lifelong sufferer of premature ejaculation then it‚Äôs almost certain that something on this list will work extremely well for you.  
  
**Method 1: Sex in the morning.**

This one is obviously situational and not possible for hookups. Sex immediately upon waking for most people will drastically increase the amount of time it takes to reach orgasm. I have personally experimented with this and reaching orgasm right upon waking is much more difficult than nighttime. Has to be within the first \~30 minutes, much longer than that and you won‚Äôt benefit from whatever causes this effect.



**Method 2: Castor oil ingestion**

Castor oil is one of the single most effective compounds on the planet for delaying ejaculation. It has extensive use in ancient Indian medical systems for this. Castor oil in large doses has a laxative effect, this is from its powerful ability to push the body‚Äôs energy DOWNWARD. It‚Äôs feels almost like it holds your pelvic floor in a constant ‚Äúreverse kegal‚Äù ‚Äúpushed out‚Äù state. All laxatives probably have this effect to some extent but in my experience castor oil is very effective. Easily can add 10 minutes to sex. Starting dose here is 1 tsp. You can keep increasing dose based on stomach tolerability and laxative effect. Be aware, as you climb into the tablespoon range you will eventually encounter the laxative effect. So test this first alone before implementing with a partner. The lower doses won‚Äôt have any laxative effect. If you don‚Äôt want to ingest castor oil directly before sex you can do what is called ‚ÄúNitya Virechana‚Äù which means consuming it once dinner is digested right before you go to sleep. It has a powerful cumulative effect if taken daily. It also tends to increase erection strength, not sure the mechanism here.



**Method 3: Ginger consumption**

Ginger, the common herb in food, dosed high enough massively increases the time it takes to reach orgasm. I noticed this by chance when taking a formula that contained high amounts of ginger, the sex was more vigorous and I really had to work hard to reach ejaculation. The dose here is 5 grams - 10 grams fresh ginger. You can use dried ginger, just be aware dried is a bit stronger gram for gram. Combining ginger and castor oil has an extremely strong effect on delaying ejaculation. It can take someone with chronic premature ejaculation to lasting a minimum of 10-15 minutes. I recommend making a tea out of it, eating this much ginger would be quite the feat.



**Method 4: Yerba Mate**  
  
To be quite honest with you I‚Äôm not sure why this one works. Yerba mate, drunk correctly out of the gourd with the bombilla has a very powerful effect in delaying ejaculation. The cans of premade yerba mate you can buy at the grocery store WILL NOT have this effect. It must be made fresh, with the herb and the gourd. Yerba Mate is a very strange stimulant, it has effects on the mind and body far beyond regular caffeine. As far as I can tell this ejaculation delaying effect from yerba mate lasts all day. Make sure if you already consume caffeine that you don‚Äôt just stack yerba mate ontop of your current caffeine consumption, instead just replace your morning coffee with yerba mate.  


**Method 5: Sida Cordifolia**  
  
Another one pulled from ancient india. Sida cordifolia is very strong at delaying ejaculation. 2-3 grams is the dose, taken any time of the day is effective. It is traditionally drank with milk, which I find enhances the effect (It likely contains compounds whose absorption is enhanced by lipids.) Sida cordifolia makes sex more vigorous, and has a profound ejaculation delaying effect. If you are taking yerba mate start the dose of sida low, the combination of the two can be too stimulating. If you are sensitive only take one or the other.  


**Method 6: Terminalia Chebula + Castor Oil:**   
  
Mix Terminalia Chebula powder with castor oil in a 1:1 ratio. 1 gram to 1 gram etc. For some of you this will prove to be more effective than castor oil alone. Terminalia is traditionally use to enhance the strength of castor oil. This combination can be taken between meals in a dosage of \~4g (Or more depending on digestibility) or it can be taken at night like described above for castor oil.  


**Method 7:** **Boerhavia Diffusa**  
  
This one is extremely interesting. This herb acts as a calcium channel blocker, a class of compounds which is almost completely unstudied for premature ejaculation. I have personally found it to have a profound effect on delaying ejaculation. But it‚Äôs very dose dependent, I find too high of a dose inhibits ones ability to get an erection. So you have to play around a bit with the dosing, probably best not to test the first time before a first date. Traditionally it is used in the 1-3 gram range, I would start at .5 grams and see how you respond to it.  
  


**Bonus Method: Steam sauna + oil massage.**   
  
Steam sauna + sesame oil applied to the skin is another very effective method that I have pulled from Indian texts for slowing time to ejaculation. I actually observed that this was an effective method by complete chance at first. I was in a sauna with my wife and we started having sex and I found it IMPOSSIBLE to climax, then after some reading I realized these observations were not new to me and had been practiced for thousands of years. First massage your body with WARM sesame oil in the shower, massaging all muscles. Then use one of those $99 personal steam saunas you can find on Amazon to steam yourself while the oil is still on your skin. This combination with some of the oral herbal formulas described above will MASSIVELY increase the time it takes for you to reach the point of ejaculation. Also if you have any anxiety disorder this will make you feel more calm than you have in years. (To clarify, this doesn‚Äôt just delay ejaculation while you are in the sauna. The effect lasts all day.)

  


\^\^\^\^\^\^\^For the above methods to work they all have to be combined. Any single intervention is unlikely to make a big enough impact unless you are a hyper-responder. (Which you might be, to one or two of them)  
  
But, the combination of all of the above can take someone who lasts 30 seconds and turn them into someone who lasts 15 minutes round 1.  
  
DO NOT JUST TAKE 1 OR 2 AND THEN GIVE UP. You must test them all, everyone's biochemistry is very different.  
  
All traditional interventions are synergistic with the herbs talked about above.   
  
Things like: Ejaculating an hour before sex is expected, numbing creams, sticking to less arousing positions etc.   
  
All of these will simply enhance the herbs I mentioned.  
  
The combination of all of this will cure MOST mens pe, there is probably a small segment of people who will respond to none of this but they are the exceptions to the rule.

We started actually hanging out after we graduated highschool but we still didn't see each other that much cause she's in college. But recently this past year we've been hanging out and talking more, we just go and have fun thrifting, shopping, and eating at restaurants, and we found this book that we want to get that has a lot of every coffee shop in our city that we want to go try, and it's not so much what we're doing but us having fun by enjoying each other's company.

1hhfjxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hhfjxw/sp_the_tale_of_emmanuel/,[SP] The Tale of Emmanuel,"Emmanuel was 31 when the accident happened. He had always been timid; never wanted much from life and life never wanted much from him. His frame was meager and tall, as if delicately propped up by two spindly stilts. His eyes sat undecidedly wide apart, separated by slender streaks of gloomy blue hair. Yes, he was kind of emo. His days were spent mostly reading books, watching Korean teledramas, and collecting fragmented tree branches from the park. Mostly the latter, actually. Boy, did he love a nice stick. Anyways, the floors in the grocery store were wet that day, but that's not what ended up killing him.

Lunch always looked the same for poor old Emmanuel. Two eggs on rye, a fried tomato, and a coffee‚Äîblack. In some ways this meal reflected his bleak outlook on life, but somehow it meant something more. His kitten Vanessa had passed away when he was 9, and this meal was the only thing he remembered her for. In a strange way, he had always associated the smell of the fried tomato with her mild and calming presence. His friends, of which he had only two, found this to be rather odd, yet, in a way somehow endearing. Regardless, what appealed greatly to Manny, I suppose, was the utter constancy of it all: no doubt, no worry‚Äîeggs, bread, tomato, coffee. No more, no less. The poor bastard would soon find out that the inevitable disruption of his steadfast feast would become a simple consequence of a much larger cataclysm.¬†

To his unsuspecting chagrin, that morning, upon opening his double-decker fridge and sifting through the various condiments and zesty homemade elixirs, Manny came to a categorical realization: only one egg remained. This presented more than a mere problem for the unruly gentleman, this was a disaster. He hurriedly shifted to his pantry, frantically inspecting each shelf of the alternate storage location in pursuit of one singular unborn offspring of a farmed chicken. This brief endeavor came to a swift close, regretfully in vain. While the truth momentarily eluded his cloudy mind, this could only mean one thing, a requisite trip to the dreaded grocery store.

Fastening his tan suede boots tightly, he tied the laces into a secure knot around his slim ankles. Perhaps for once in his life, he had a mission‚Äînay, a purpose: retrieve the egg. The door brushed like a feather behind him, sweeping a gust of light air that followed his lengthy strides. Upon exiting his obscure 4th floor apartment, Manny set his feet on the city street, staggering one foot after the other, in a feat of uncharacteristically graceful and determined motion. As he approached, the illuminated sign projecting ""GramMax"" stood proudly on the facade of the gargantuan supermarket, it was evident he had made it to his destination. Perusing the aisles of the store, his eyes scanned each and every item until he found the four lettered label ""E-G-G-S"". He grabbed about a hundred of them, swooping them into his large duffel bag. Glancing at him with a short-lived air of confusion, the cashier (by the time of writing this story cashiers no longer exist, since their replacement with check-out bots) proceeded to scan his centurion of eggs and wished him farewell. Just one of the undeniable affordances of freedom, Manny thought to himself as he strutted out of the emporium. Unfortunately for him at least, fate would not see him leave that damned store.

About ten feet from the sliding doors that marked the store's exit, all of a sudden, one of Manny's two overgrown feet dragged uncontrollably on the freshly mopped and moistened ground. Compensating for his earlier lapse in bipedal grounding, Manny's trailing foot grappled the floor tile, whipping himself into a skidding frenzy across the building. By some ungodly odds, in his rapid forward motion, he had somehow spun himself into a perfect state of bodily equilibrium. According to scattered witness reports, Manny was said to have been gliding, like a skater on ice, reaching around the pace of a motorcycle at full throttle. To the layman, this slip was in many ways, frankly unbelievable. However, since the event, both scientists and specialists alike have found consensus in the fact that: ""While this occurrence is certainly improbable, it damn well is possible."" At least that's how they put it. Some say it was at least worthy of posthumous mention in that year's edition of the Guinness Book of World Records‚Ñ¢, but beyond the scope of the highly knowledgeable, this tragedy would go almost entirely unnoticed by the general public. Bar one report in a local paper, that is. Nevertheless, this was for good reason: it was the same day in 2036 that the stock market had entirely collapsed for a second time. I must confess, explaining that in further detail is far beyond my pay grade. Do your own research. 

Either way, that's beside the point. I have a tendency to ramble... Crucial to this testimony, if not for a handful of conveniently positioned surveillance cameras, this moment would have remained a folkloric tale of pure human mystery. Without further ado, Manny ultimately would not find his demise within the confines of this ghastly supermarket. Shooting like an arrow from a taut bow, his body flung out the building doors straight into the path of a speeding car. A hit and run from a McLaren 720S, I must add.¬†

An ending lackluster in nature, undoubtedly, to an incident so riddling and enigmatic. A rather pathetic tale I must say, but one worth sharing. This would be the fateful end to Manny's inconsequential story. Remembered by few, forgotten by many, his story lives on in complete insignificance. Some of you may be asking yourselves how I know all of this?¬†

Well of course, it was my MacLaren that killed Emmanuel.

### Understanding Teeth Whitening Methods

Before diving into the results, it helps to consider the different teeth whitening methods available. Each method has its unique advantages and can lead to varying results. Here are some common options:

- **At-home kits:** Over-the-counter whitening kits can be effective but may take longer to show significant changes.
- **Whitening toothpaste:** While they can help maintain brightness, these products often deliver subtle results compared to other methods.
- **Natural remedies:** Ingredients like baking soda or activated charcoal are sometimes used, but results can be less predictable.

### Before Whitening: The Moment of Decision

Many people hesitate to begin whitening their teeth due to concerns about effectiveness and potential sensitivity. It's common to feel uncertain before you start. Noticing discoloration or staining can be a catalyst for many to seek a brighter smile. Reading or watching ""before after"" experiences can help you understand what to expect.

Choosing the Right Teeth Whitening Method for Your Needs
--------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a brighter smile, choosing the right teeth whitening method is essential for satisfying results. With various options available, it can feel overwhelming to decide which technique is best for your needs. Understanding the different methods can help you weigh the pros and cons and make an informed decision that fits your lifestyle and goals.

### Types of Teeth Whitening Methods

There are several popular methods for whitening teeth. Each has its unique process and effectiveness, so consider your individual circumstances carefully. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the main options:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Professional In-Office Whitening:** This method utilizes powerful whitening agents and can produce dramatic results in just one appointment. A dentist oversees the procedure to ensure safety and effectiveness. Results can last significantly longer than at-home treatments, making it a worthy investment for some.
- **At-Home Professional Kits:** Your dentist may provide custom trays and whitening gel for at-home use. This approach allows you to whiten your teeth at your convenience while still benefiting from professional-grade products. Results generally appear over several days or weeks, depending on the concentration of the gel.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** You‚Äôll find a variety of whitening strips, gels, and toothpaste available at local drugstores. While these options are more affordable, the results may be less dramatic, and they may take longer to achieve the desired shade. If you're looking for a quick touch-up, over-the-counter products can be a suitable choice.
- **Natural Remedies:** Many people explore natural methods for teeth whitening, such as baking soda, apple cider vinegar, or activated charcoal. While these ingredients can help brighten your smile gradually, they may not be as effective as other methods. Moreover, caution is advised, as some natural remedies can erode enamel with overuse.

### Factors to Consider When Choosing a Method

Choosing the best teeth whitening method for your needs involves several key factors. Here‚Äôs what to keep in mind:

1. **Desired Results:** If you‚Äôre looking for quick and dramatic results, professional in-office whitening may be your best bet. For more subtle changes, over-the-counter treatments might suffice.
2. **Time Commitment:** Consider how much time you can dedicate to the whitening process. Professional treatments take less time overall, while at-home kits require daily application over several weeks.
3. **Budget:** Know how much you‚Äôre willing to spend. Professional treatments are usually more expensive than over-the-counter options, but they often provide faster and more noticeable results.
4. **Sensitivity Concerns:** If you have sensitive teeth, some whitening methods can exacerbate the pain. Consult your dentist to find a suitable product that minimizes discomfort.
5. **Oral Health:** Any existing dental issues should be addressed before starting a whitening regimen. Ensure your teeth and gums are healthy to achieve optimal results.

### Maintaining Your Results

No matter which teeth whitening method you choose, maintaining those results is crucial. Here are some tips to help you keep your smile bright:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush twice daily and floss regularly to prevent discoloration. Use whitening toothpaste to help maintain your results.
- **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks:** Limit your intake of coffee, tea, red wine, and sodas, as these can stain teeth over time. If you do consume them, rinse your mouth afterward.
- **Schedule Regular Dental Check-ups:** Regular visits to the dentist can help catch any potential problems early and keep your smile looking its best.

Ultimately, the right teeth whitening method will depend on your specific needs and preferences. Take the time to explore your options, and don‚Äôt hesitate to ask your dentist for recommendations. With the right approach, achieving a bright, confident smile is possible.

### Conclusion

Seeing the transformation in teeth whitening results before and after treatments can be incredibly motivating. Many individuals report a significant boost in self-confidence and an overall brighter smile post-treatment. This change is not merely cosmetic; it can lead to enhanced social interactions and a more radiant presence. Whether you choose in-office treatments, at-home kits, or natural solutions, understanding the impact of the before and after effects is essential.

Choosing the right teeth whitening method is a crucial step towards achieving the smile you desire. Each option offers unique benefits, and what works for one person might not be the best fit for another. Assessing your needs‚Äîsuch as the level of whitening you wish to achieve, your budget, and the time you can commit‚Äîwill help you make an informed decision. Your dental health is paramount, so consulting with a dentist can provide personalized guidance that caters to your situation.

One of the girls in his friend group has been his friend for about a year or two, and they would occasionally hang out one on one when he was single but mostly in friend groups, but since we have been dating she doesn‚Äôt seem to respect boundaries.

She asked my boyfriend to grab coffee one on one, talks to him about her hookups/inappropriate conversations with him, begged him to tell her my social media so she could follow me, and posted a picture of him and her together (conveniently after I followed her back).

My boyfriend told her he will not hang out with her one on one, communicated to her that it wasn‚Äôt appropriate for her to ask to hang out now that he is dating me, and I got to the the point in an argument where I made him block her, but he wants us to be on good terms/cordial so the friend group is not strained. I feel he is trying his best to mitigate issues and hasn‚Äôt done anything to breach trust.

However, I feel she is being incredibly disrespectful and jealous of our relationship, and want her out of his life. He sounds like he will no longer reach out to her and will commit to boundaries, but is unwilling to re-block her. He agreed to speak to her how she made both me and him feel uncomfortable and if she‚Äôs unwilling to be supportive of me, she will be removed from his life.

Do you think he is handling this correctly, or are my feelings fair? Is me speaking with her and trying to build at least a cordial friendship helpful? It is the root cause of many of my issues and triggers my insecurities, abandonment fears, and BPD episodes when she is brought up. 

We love each other immensely, he is incredibly supportive, and wants it to be fair for both of us, however we end up handling this. We are also beginning couples therapy to work through this and my recent diagnosis of BPD. Thank you in advance.",2,1734565894.0,Codependency,2,1.0,False

One of the girls in his friend group has been his friend for about a year or two, and they would occasionally hang out one on one when he was single but mostly in friend groups, but since we have been dating she doesn‚Äôt seem to respect boundaries.

She asked my boyfriend to grab coffee one on one, talks to him about her hookups/inappropriate conversations with him, begged him to tell her my social media so she could follow me, and posted a picture of him and her together (conveniently after I followed her back).

My boyfriend told her he will not hang out with her one on one, communicated to her that it wasn‚Äôt appropriate for her to ask to hang out now that he is dating me, and I got to the the point in an argument where I made him block her, but he wants us to be on good terms/cordial so the friend group is not strained. I feel he is trying his best to mitigate issues and hasn‚Äôt done anything to breach trust.

However, I feel she is being incredibly disrespectful and jealous of our relationship, and want her out of his life. He sounds like he will no longer reach out to her and will commit to boundaries, but is unwilling to re-block her. He agreed to speak to her how she made both me and him feel uncomfortable and if she‚Äôs unwilling to be supportive of me, she will be removed from his life.

Do you think he is handling this correctly, or are my feelings fair? Is me speaking with her and trying to build at least a cordial friendship helpful? It is the root cause of many of my issues and triggers my insecurities, abandonment fears, and BPD episodes when she is brought up. 


We love each other immensely, he is incredibly supportive, and wants it to be fair for both of us, however we end up handling this. We are also beginning couples therapy to work through this and my recent diagnosis of BPD. Thank you in advance.",1,1734565860.0,BPD,10,1.0,False

1hhffn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1hhffn8/sensory_experience_and_gender_norms/,Sensory experience and gender norms,"My doctor recently told me that I am very inner oriented. 
That has stuck in my mind.

Indeed - I think about my comfort all the time subconsciously.

I am often too cold or too hot.

I eat about six small meals a day. There is no option to have a light breakfast and a huge dinner.

I am bothered by background noise, intense smells, flashing lights, the feeling of being in a big mess around, for example, a cafe in a supermarket.

I always want silence.

If someone refuses to turn off their phone in my presence, I usually just walk away and offer to meet when that person is 100% free.

I communicate a lot non-verbally with facial expressions, gestures, posture, changes in voice tone.

I think a lot about whether I will be safe and comfortable getting to point A. The same goes for going home. I always have money for a taxi.

I am very sensitive and I perceive the slightest change in the mood of the interlocutor, the change in the atmosphere.

I feel what the attention of everyone in the room is on.

I read the room, understanding who wants to be there, who is there for duty, who would like to leave and is bored.

With people who are unable to delve into themselves, relax and let go, who are unable to sit still, who need something to happen all the time, I practically do not communicate in everyday life at all.

***

If you think about it, this is all normal, within the norm. But the doctor also said that being an inner oriented  person is a very feminine trait.

You might think that men can only do one thing at a time, but they can do it in such a way that nothing can bother them.

Since I am the only one who takes care of my well-being, and I need a lot to feel 90% perfect in a public space,
then it turns out that I have to plan all the time every day. 

What to pack in my bag - extra clothes, snacks. Where to go to warm up in the city center during winter. 

I have to know where are the toilets in the city center that have very good, Western European-standard hygiene and cleanliness conditions.

I have to know where is a friend/acquaintance to go for tea if I have to stay in another city for a longer time, and the bus is twice a day.

***

This is all related to my bodily experience. I don't know how to ask  for a body that doesn't freeze, doesn't want to eat, and doesn't want to run away from pungent smells ten meters (30 feet) away.

Does this mean that I will be a very feminine person for the rest of my life?

If I need much more comfort than many of my female friends, who can drive a car after four hours of sleep, can make responsible decisions on an empty stomach, just sipping coffee, does that mean they are more masculine than me?

What did that doctor mean by all that? A woman's bodily experience is her value.

This is autism/ sensory overload related, so I decided to post it there.

It has been about 5-6 weeks now, I am still out of home technically homeless.  To answer few questions : my name is not on the house since money was fortunately provided by MIL and I agreed, I just have been paying mortgage since we got the place and rents at the previous place we shared for about year. 

It was tough with Thanksgiving and now it is saddened with upcoming Christmas.  Me and her still talk here and there and go out to grab dinners or coffee sometimes and I tried to see if we could try one more time as well as with MIL and see if we could make it work, but she still wants some time off from me and asking me to find a place even for temporary and pick my stuffs up.. many of my stuffs have been already boxed by her inside garage.  My access to garage door/smart door/cameras have all been removed, so now I also have to work with her if I need to pick up some stuffs here and there and I am being told to pick all my stuffs up and move it out everytime. 

  
I haven't gotten to see my pets for all these times too and finally got to see them when I was picking up work stuffs this morning and yeah I broke down a bit in car afterwards .  it has been weeks of mood swings. I was blaming her during while we fought month ago, and I am realizing now those were happier times still when I had family.  I am still kind of preparing for Christmas in case things will change or me trying again and again would help changing things around, but it has been rough.   Being seperate for 6 months don't seem really sound like a good idea for me and I don't want to move things out yet while we are still trying to make this work, but sleeping around motels or inside cars and having to manage work have been pretty challenging ( good that my job is remote) 

For my personal background, I also stopped talking to my own parents/family because me and wife went through a lot to get where we wanted to be and it had to come to a point where no contact was the best to protect everyone's feelings and she mattered to me the most so I did that.  Now I lost both family and I just have been feeling really empty.  Maybe love really can't solve everything and I was being naive. 

Anyway, just wanted to rant, since I don't have much place to share. Wishing you all a Merry Christmas

My husband is a wonderful partner, co-parent, father, generally just a great person - he's funny and kind and considerate and consistently someone I can rely on.

One of the things we always had to work on once we started living together was sex - he wanted it more often than I did, and we fell into a pattern where I'd announce I was going to bed, he'd follow me and try to physically initiate, and if I said no, I got a cold shoulder and stonewalling. Over time, I learned that saying yes even when I didn't want to was easier than dealing with the hurt feelings for saying no. Further on in our relationship, I proposed that we have sex X times per week to help both of us - I could ensure I was in the right mental space and not feeling hunted, and he could know it was always going to happen and not feel like he had to forecast when the right time was. For years, this worked out great.

Then over the last year, things began to change. My husband has always been a little jealous, stating he's guarded after being cheated on in his first real relationship in high school/college, but things grew out of proportion - I run into an acquaintance on my way back from the restroom at an event and chat for 10 minutes, he's mad. I mention an ex in passing (who I talk to on occasion, a fact I've never hidden), and he's mad. I talk about wanting to take my friend on a girl's trip, joking she just needs to meet some normal idiots in normal bars (she had recently escaped a deadly relationship), and it leads to an all-out argument. He consistently states that he trusts me, but he doesn't trust other men. I finally snap - after 12 years, and only 1 of us having cheated (not me), when was he going to trust me? Small spats like this happened with increasing frequency over the spring and summer.

While all of this is going on, our sex life begins to change. Whereas sex was still happening on an agreed-upon frequency/schedule, suddenly he's pushing for more. We had friends over for dinner, both of us with small children, and while everyone else is downstairs, he pressures me for a blowjob in our upstairs guest room...I gave in for a few seconds, then jumped up and left. Soon after that incident, I come down one morning and he's apologizing for something related to jealousy, and he's pulling me toward another room to have sex on the couch...I state, repeatedly and firmly, that I just want to drink my coffee and our 2-year old is here and I don't want to...until when he's all but pushing me onto the couch, I give in, saying ""Just do what you want, don't even worry about me."" So he does just that. Afterward, I burst into tears and babble about some sexuality book I want him to read. He starts to read it, but soon it's gathering dust on his nightstand. We talk about him seeing a therapist...he goes for 1 session then decides he has ""nothing to talk about,"" which just about bowls me over, since the entire point was to talk about his jealousy and everything going on. The topic is dropped for a while.

Eventually in the early fall, I spill all of this to my therapist - I completely break down, sharing that I don't want my husband to touch me and lately I can't get through sex without being on the brink of tears, dissociating for most of it. She gives me the ""this isn't your fault"" talk and immediately pushes me to sleep in another room, lock the door, and if I'm interested in staying married, to find a specialist \*stat\*. I sit with this information for a few weeks before spilling everything to my husband...while he sees those events differently, he doesn't argue what happened, acknowledges that his behavior was unacceptable, and is deeply ashamed by his actions - immediately agreeing to go back to personal therapy as well as couples.

So here we are, some months later, and we're in couples counseling while seeing our individual therapists. We haven't had sex in nearly 3 months. Our couples counselor has advised that my reaction to my husband's touch is a natural consequence of what transpired, and for now, my husband needs to respect my boundaries - when we're able, trying to cuddle for a few minutes would be a healthy way to explore reopening those boundaries. My husband is working on respecting my space, understanding that I need these boundaries for now, and also moderating his emotions so that they don't dominate the mood of the entire house - not that he can't feel them, but expressing them in other ways.

I'm not opposed to any of these recommendations, and am practicing them as much as I feel comfortable, but I've since lost all romantic feelings toward my partner and I feel horrible. He's doing everything he can and more to make things right - taking on projects, increasing how much he's doing with our child, surprising me with thoughtful gifts, and trying to respect my boundaries (not always succeeding) - while those are all incredibly thoughtful ways to show that he cares, it's not generating any change in how I'm feeling. I'm not mad at him, I'm not scared of him, and I still love him as my best friend and the father of my child...but that ""pull"" isn't there, and the idea of even trying to have sex again immediately puts me in tears. He's trying to be patient and limiting his hugs/kisses, but I can tell how much it hurts him every time I choose not to go in for that closeness, and I feel a constant pressure to make progress. For the last few weeks, he's checked in at least every few days to see if anything has changed, and it visibly kills him when I say that I don't feel any differently. My people-pleasing reaction is to want to tell him that things will get better, to console him physically and emotionally, but I know that's not the right thing to do given how I'm feeling. I've considered separating, but with our small child, that just feels like a logistical nightmare that may only make things worse, but the few nights I've had home alone have felt like a weight off of my shoulders to be able to just exist without suffocation.

So that's where we're at...I love my husband, but I'm not \*in love\*, and I can tell that it's killing him, and all of this pressure and guilt over the lack of progress is killing me. He's so visibly impacted by what's going on - every time I walk into a room he looks at me with sad eyes and I can just feel how tense things are. So then I'm miserable at home and constantly on the verge of tears, and I can't discern all of that stress and guilt and pressure from how I actually feel about my husband, or get any sense of if those feelings will ever come back.

Any words of wisdom would be helpful - I have no idea what to do or how to even figure out how I feel.

Hello everyone.

It‚Äôs been about 7 months since [my last post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/s/KP9V7qHiPP)

I‚Äôm not gonna lie, this year has been incredibly challenging for me. I spent the first half of the year grinding away at my thesis, PA school applications and subsequent interviews. The events of my last post happened around this time, and I began to sink back into a dark place I haven‚Äôt been in for a very long time. I‚Äôm not comfortable sharing exactly what I was feeling in between my last post and now, but I felt like a failure, not just with my dating life, but in every aspect of my life.

Since then, I had to leave a job I love in search of more money and ended up at a place where everything is falling apart and people are jumping ship left and right (the company I now work for is a subsidiary of UHC, if that helps paint a mental picture).

It‚Äôs at this job where I get most of my thinking done, and a lot of it has to do with my incredibly pessimistic view of my future. A few days ago though, something happened to me. I don‚Äôt know what it was, but at some point, somewhere within the depths of my misery, I just kinda said‚Ä¶ 

What the fuck am I doing? Why am I devoting so much of my mental energy to hating myself? I‚Äôm tired of feeling this way. I‚Äôm tired of feeling like a failure and burden. I‚Äôm tired of tying myself into knots to suck the joy out of any happiness I experience. I‚Äôm tired of finding the negative in anything and everything about myself. I want to believe I‚Äôm worth something. I want to believe I can be a good partner. I want to believe the future is bright. 

To everyone who replied to my last post, I thank you for doing so, and I‚Äôm sorry for doubting you. No matter how much I read the things you wrote for me, I just couldn‚Äôt internalize them. I believed that I could just continue to drift through life, find contentment in misery and be protected from pain and hardship. Someone left a comment there that didn‚Äôt truly resonate with me until right now. There‚Äôs one line in particular from that comment that now hits me like a freight train:

>‚ÄúYou're afraid of hearing no from anyone but yourself, so you tell yourself no and then you don't have to be afraid of anything...except waking up every day in a life that's so much less than you could have had if you had the courage to put yourself out there.‚Äù 

To the person that said this‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre right. Everything I do is to protect myself from imaginary scenarios I make up. But I‚Äôm done with this. I‚Äôve grown bored of my own misery. I want more for myself. I want to change.

**Why the change of heart?**

It was definitely the culmination of a bunch of things that happened to me recently. Some of it‚Äôs compelling, some of it‚Äôs really dumb. I‚Äôll go down the list one by one:

- Perhaps my biggest motivator to actually try dating is the fact that I actually did get into PA school! I start September 2025, and having a defined ‚Äútime limit‚Äù (for lack of a better term) does a lot for my motivation. I also don‚Äôt intend on dating during PA school as I don‚Äôt want any distractions, so I want to get some experience before I begin the next phase of my life.
- Plus, like‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna be a literal healthcare provider once I‚Äôm done with PA school. If I‚Äôm too afraid to ask a woman to coffee right now, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm gonna be able to manage cardiothoracic surgery or whatever. Imagine your PCP going back to his office after an appointment with you and posting on r/IncelExit that he‚Äôs afraid to talk to women. Absurd, right? It‚Äôs time to grow up a little.
- Recently I went to a friend‚Äôs party. It was like a double birthday and a Halloween party. At this party, one of the birthday boys got super hammered, to the point where he could barely sit up straight or formulate a coherent sentence. Everyone told me to leave him be and that he would be fine, but I just couldn‚Äôt leave him alone. Last year I went out to a bar for one of my old fraternity brother‚Äôs birthdays. I ended up in the hospital that night because no one bothered to look out for me. I couldn‚Äôt live with myself if I let the same thing happen to this guy. So there I stayed with him, bringing him water and making sure he didn‚Äôt fall onto the hard concrete the entire night. One of my self limiting beliefs was that I had no redeeming qualities or anything positive about myself, but now I have real, tangible evidence that I am, at the very least, an empathetic and caring person. 
- Alright this is one of the dumb ones: at my job some old ladies said that I‚Äôm cute and have nice skin, and like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs impossible not to feel a little good about yourself after hearing that, ya know? 
- Another dumb one: The algorithm has been feeding me a lot of dating/relationship content lately, and it made me realize that a) being inexperienced at my age isn‚Äôt a necessarily a dealbreaker as long as I don‚Äôt fixate on it, and b) I already have a leg up by not being a misogynistic manbaby (I don‚Äôt think). 
- The new year is coming up and I think it‚Äôll be fun to have a resolution to work towards. 

**What are you expecting from all this?**

Initially I wanted a serious relationship, but now that I have less than a year until PA school, I don‚Äôt think that makes a lot of sense anymore. I don‚Äôt want to make anyone wait for me for 32 months. So now I think I just want to go on a few casual dates, see who‚Äôs out there, and just try to have fun. If September rolls around and I can look back and say that I put forth a consistent, earnest effort towards dating, I‚Äôd consider that a success. 

**What‚Äôs your social circle like?**

My social circle consists of some friends I made during college, my fraternity, and my high school friends that I still keep in touch with from time to time. I love all my college and high school friends and trust them deeply. There‚Äôs some women in these circles, but they‚Äôre the girlfriends of the guys. I love and trust them as much as everyone else, I just can‚Äôt date them obviously. My fraternity though? They‚Äôre a ton of fun to hang out with but after the bar incident, I realized many of them aren‚Äôt that great as friends. I‚Äôve stepped back from them a lot since then.

**How many women have you asked out?**

I think the last time I asked someone out was in high school. It‚Äôs been a while, and I would be pretty much starting from scratch. But if I can muster the social skills to pass the PA school interview process, I can learn to ask women out.

**Are there any women you‚Äôre interested in right now?**

There‚Äôs this one woman at my job who I think is awesome, but we don‚Äôt see each other that often after she switched facilities. She‚Äôs also older than me by a non-negligible amount (I‚Äôm 22M, she‚Äôs 30F) and is probably in a very different phase of life than me. Plus, don‚Äôt shit where you eat and whatnot.

**What‚Äôs your plan?**

I don‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm here to ask. Hopefully the image of my life is a little clearer to you all now. What do you think I should do?

So in that spirit I figure I'll talk about my goals for next year. I like goals- structure. I have OCD and an ED. Like of course, you know?

So firstly- I'm going to very deliberately change my wardrobe to flattering in the here and now. Too many things are too small or too big so I'm going to donate them and work on my confidence and feeling good about myself. It's not all physical but I like dressing for the day even if I'm staying at home. There's a huge difference when I'm having a depressive episode and it actually clues me in much quicker. So sturdy classic pieces with my own flare. 

I'm seriously considering giving my kid my car. I drive my husband's all of the time because it's easier on me physically. I don't know though. I'm working through the pros and cons here but he'll need rides to school. I think I'd just ask to borrow it if there's any conflicting appointments. 

I'm going to make life easier on myself. I've bought an electric bath brush and toothbrush. I'm going to get a nice electric razor. Some massage equipment specifically for my ow zones- eye massager, between the shoulder blades, neck. A heating pad. Compression gloves- I have socks coming. I'm focused on conserving energy.

And I'm going to make changes to the house like trim and painting not big areas. A few new pieces of furniture. Clear out more space. Finish the photo book for my kid. I won't live forever. Someday this will be his house. He can change things but a nice foundation is important. 

I'd like to say more exercise and losing weight but I don't want a ton of pressure on myself there. My symptoms are wildly unmanaged. I'll do my best but I'm going to try to not get frustrated or pissed at myself so much. 

I wonder what your goals or plans are? 

Oh yeah. I'm going to leave my hair shoulder length, get a trim, use the blue until the bleached ends grow out. I'd like auburn hair next, I think. 

Oh yeah pt 2! Less dairy. I like coconut yogurt and oatmilk a lot. I know sugar matters here too but just more fruit, more veggies. I do pretty well with that but I'd like to improve even more. I'd like a snazzy coffee set up beyond a 10 dollar drip. Lol.

This involves many hours of work from me as you can imagine and I have to wake up at 7AM to get all of the timings right. 

The problem with this is that my partner and I barely get any time together on Christmas Day, we‚Äôd like to wake up, have a coffee, spend time together, open presents, maybe have a light breakfast and then get to cooking dinner at midday. 

We don‚Äôt usually eat breakfast or lunch as we intermittent fast and we‚Äôre never hungry for a giant plate of roasted food at 1 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, effectively ruining the Christmas meal for us anyway. 

When children were involved and everyone had to get home early I compromised, even though I still didn‚Äôt really understand the whole eating at midday thing, but this year now the youngest child in attendance is 12 I tried to meet them in the middle and say could we maybe have it at 3? 

I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm selfish and that I don‚Äôt compromise and that this is ridiculous. Thus I‚Äôve decided that my partner and I will go round to see the family in the afternoon but not eat dinner with them.

It's an embarrassing situation. I had an electrician build the service and install the empty panels, and I did the circuit planning and pulled all the wires and install the breakers. I asked my electrical who built my service for the biggest panel. And he installed a 40/80 for my outdoor main, which is mostly empty, and then a 200a sub inside a centrally located utility room and another 200a main in the garage. It never occurred to me to double check my inside panels, and it turns out thoss are only 30 spaces. I just assumed they were all 40/80. I designed the circuits and I went a bit over the top with dedicated circuits because I thought I had lots of spaces. For an all electric house with multiple EV chargers and overkill on dedicated circuits for kitchen/bar/coffee areas etc. and generator backup, I ended up needing 32 spaces for each inside panel. So now I'm searching for the best solution. 

1. Replace my garage panel to 40 spaces. 

2. Install an additional 100a sub in the other end garage. 

3. Bring a bunch of garage circuits all the way to the outdoor main which is empty (not an easy pull and a lot more wiring cost)

4. Install some tandem breakers in the garage panel to save some space. Hence I'm asking if this is allowed for new construction. I'm in CO. 

My utility room sub I've already fully built and it's basically full so I'm not touching that. If I ever need more space, I will just replace some with tandems in the future. But for my garage sub, I wonder if I can install some tandems now as I have so many 240v circuits taking up so much space. ",1,1734564113.0,AskElectricians,3,1.0,False

Vaccinations need restarting - but was waiting for vet to confirm she was ok first. Generally healthy, went to the vet last week and got a text saying there were no significant changes to her bloods. Vomits 3-4 times a month (yowls loudly before throwing up, usually fairly big puddles of digested food but is okay right after vomiting)

She had some cooked chicken night, only soft meat and 2 pieces of cartilage off the ends of the bones, made sure there were no bones by mushing it up with fingers. Hasn‚Äôt ate any food today it seems like but finished up the chicken overnight. She also caught and ate half a tail off a rat she caught yesterday.
Was running around and acting completely normal up until 3pm this afternoon when she I noticed her looking a bit ‚Äúsad‚Äù and sat weirdly puffed up in a blanket.


Vomited around 4-5 hours ago now (5/6pm UK time) - vomit smelled quite bad compared to usual, like a mixture of bad cat breath and cat farts? At first I thought she HAD farted but it was just the vomit. Vomit was looked fully digested but had a few black bits in it, thought maybe it‚Äôs just hairs.

She came to sit with us for about 2 hours but didn‚Äôt relax fully, just sat in a puffed up loaf not looking like her usual self, no purring at all when being pet.

 I got a cup of milk and offered her a sniff (she usually goes mad for it whenever we‚Äôre having some) but nothing. 
Took off her collar in case it was bothering her/irritating her throat and it felt quite tight, despite it having been on the same length w/ a 2 finger gap for months)
Found it odd so I got some of her favourite treats out (again, she‚Äôd normally eat the whole tub if she could) - she got up, came over but didn‚Äôt even walk up to them to smell or anything.

After that, around an hour ago she went upstairs to sit (upright) in the dark, when we followed to check up on her she walked away and retreated to a corner she never sits in. Tried going up to her and offering my hand but she just looked terrified, turning her head away. I‚Äôve put a blanket over the corner she‚Äôs in and turned off the lights, checking every 30 mins from a distance, but she seems the same.

 Got vomit out of the bin and inspected it after googling what it might be, seems like some black bits but I‚Äôm not sure if they would count as ‚Äúcoffee grounds‚Äù. 
Don‚Äôt want to panic or force her to go back to the vets, but just a bit worried about how urgent it is, could she just be a bit constipated and needs to wait for it to pass? Is there anything we can do/give her to help? 
If necessary we‚Äôll call the vet tonight, but wanted to check first as I‚Äôm not sure what constipation can be like in cats.

Any advice greatly appreciated, thank you!

Started working out four days later with 16 surgical staples still in my groin and that hurt bad but not enough to keep me down. 

PRASAD naam sun ke food samjhe kya?!!

I‚Äôve lost weight, lost appetite but haven‚Äôt lost the fire. üî• 

Today is the monthly anniversary of my second surgery after the first one went wrong. (2nd picture) 

Friends and relatives in North America (or anywhere) : 

Don‚Äôt feel guilty. You‚Äôre not obligated to keep a tab on me; neither do I expect you to drop everything and visit me, nor was it an emergency of any kind. 

Trust me when I say I‚Äôm not alone; he is with me in deep waters and the waters cannot drown me, he is with me in the fire, and the fire cannot burn me and the flame cannot consume me. 

Thanks for your prayers and support. 

When death finds you, may it find you alive. üî•üôèüèº

My bigger priorities would be offering the best product to clients. The best support services I'm guessing when it comes to tax planning and what not. Autonomy (ideally no requirement to be in office or work set hours) and some potential leads here and there if possible.

For context, I'm ok with the long game and not making as much in this moment given I have another paying gig I'll work on evenings and weekends for about 20 hours a week to supplement the income drop.

Apologies if this isn't the place did have a look at the rules and couldn't obviously spot this isn't allowed.

Man oh man. I've been in and out of Aa for about 3 years and I know the general advise is to wait a year. I'm coming up to six months sobriety and thought I'd dip my feet into dating again.

Downloaded hinge got some matches and went on a couple dates. Kept it chill coffee and a chat. But man dating without drinking is hard alcohol acted as my crutch for years and obviously drifted to those types of people who drank and used like me. But caused a lot of trainwrecks in the madness.

But honestly no second date as of yet. When asked why I don't drink if asked I just say I can't handle the hangovers anymore some truth there not lying about it as don't want to build a relationship on lies just not coming outright saying in an alcoholic some women even compliment me on it and people tend to accept it as I'm 35 and have a job etc and its rather expensive these days.

Generally am told these days I seem a lot more together and look a lot better than I did. But just not clicking with these women.

Thought about dating other sober people but don't want to be viewed as inappropriate or make any meetings awkward by asking someone there if they want to get a coffee even though I've hit it off with a couple women before but as said came to conclusion it was probably a bad idea.

Part of me wants the whole family thing dating is tough enough in the current envrionment we all live in online I think definitely has made things worse. I had a few women during my 20's I could have probably settled down with but chose drinking, partying and using over a real relationship.

Feel like my life is taking off in other aspects, job is decent have a career now, close with my family and have become dependable. Made boundaries with friends where I was a people pleaser had to drop some but gained new ones in sobriety too.

I know I just have to keep at it, probably at it probably the alcoholic mind, impatience and self pity.

1hheh12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Medium/comments/1hheh12/i_think_i_might_be_psychic_or_something/,I think I might be psychic or something?,"Hello. I never thought much about the things that have happened to me surrounding death or injury as anything other than coincidence. I do believe in the paranormal, spiritual, and the beyond, but I never thought it was anything more than my belief, versus experience.

When it comes to experiences, mine started around the age of 5, before I started school and was in daycare. I woke up one morning very early and was in a frantic state of mind as I kept telling my mom that my friend Jack was in danger; that something bad has happened to him. I also kept repeating the color red, although I do specific remember seeing a red slide, which if he got hurt playing on a red slide, then that made sense. My mom could not calm me. My mom took me to daycare a little early and once we got there, we were told that my friend Jack, who also went to this daycare, was in a bad car accident and a red car was involved (although I can't remember if it was the car they were in, or another car that was involved).

Another experience was when I was a little bit older and we had a neighbor across the street who would have to come over to where our block's mail boxes were, right in front of my house. Me and my mom were loading up in the car one day to leave, and as our neighbor came to the mailbox, I shouted out at her, ""Hi Pokey!!"" My mom thought this was very rude and had me apologize, but before I could, our neighbor came over with a shocked look on her face as she asked me where I'd heard that. I'm just a child, wasn't I just saying random stuff? But it turned out, that was her childhood nickname. Mind you, this was never once told to us, as we weren't really close to this woman.

Up until this point, nothing seemed to be too weird. I do believe that children are more open to the 3rd eye or whatever the right terminology is, and I just pawned the explanation on that.

The next experience I had that seemed very small at the time, but now looking back on it, I can't logically explain. I was 17 and it was Thanksgiving 2014. We had Friendsgiving since we didn't have any family near us anymore, since we moved 5 states away the year prior. The next day my boyfriend at the time, mom, and I went to Minot ND which was where the nearest mall to us was located, 2 hours away. We went shopping and as we were walking around the mall, I saw the LIDS store. I'd never once bought anything from this store, nor had I ever had anything custom made with anyone's name on it from any store to be specific. I had the most random idea to get my dog's name embroidered on a beanie. Her name was Coffee, so I also thought it would be pretty funny to have a hat with the name coffee on it in general. 2 days after I had this beanie made, my mom and I were at her school doing some work in her classroom (she's a teacher), and she stops us only about 30 minutes in to working which is odd since we usually spend a few hours at her school on the weekends. She sat me down and had told me that our neighbor from our hometown who had my dog, had called her that morning and told me some distressing news. My dog had actually passed away on Thanksgiving, which was 1 day before I got the beanie made, and 3 days before I found out. I always found this odd, and very coincidental, but maybe the universe was giving me a subtle hint? 

Then we fast forward to 2018, when my GG (great grandma) passed away at the early hours of the morning, like around 2am. I don't normally have insomnia or troubles sleeping, like ever, I feel very blessed, but on this night I woke up at around the 2am hour and couldn't fall back asleep until almost 4am. I woke up sad, like I'd had one of those bad dreams that give you a weird unexplainable feeling when you wake up, but you never can remember what was in the dream. I found out about my GG I think the next day. That was a very small thing, but it still feels very weird.

A few months ago I lost my Great Aunt, who was actually GG's daughter. She's had cancer for years, but this summer she got very sick and was in the hospital where she found out she had a brain tumor. It was very severe and too far gone, so we knew she was going to die soon, just didn't know when. But a couple months after we found out about the tumor, I was running very early for my first appointment for work, and normally I wouldn't take myself out to a sit down restaurant and eat. Usually I'll grab a quick bite and sit in my car, but I decided to find a cute little diner and sit down for a couple of hours and enjoy breakfast with some Netflix. I was sitting at this small table that only fits 2; one on each side. When I was finished, I left to go to my appointment which was only 15 minutes away, and my mom calls me to tell me my aunt passed away a little while before, during the time that I was sitting across from an empty seat, where I believe she was sitting to enjoy some time with me before she moved on. Now this is all speculation of course, because I didn't feel anything weird or believe she was there, I just hope she was.

Now lastly, this one is the one that was the bottom of the iceberg that pushed me to post here; to find some outside opinions and thoughts.

Last Friday the 13th I started to have this HORRIBLE feeling. Like a gut wrenching, pit in my stomach, something bad is gonna happen, feeling. I couldn't shake it. I thought maybe I was about to start my time of the month, or the fact I might've been going stir crazy since I was home with a sick kid, but as the weekend persisted and my kid got better, the feeling still wouldn't shake. Well Monday comes around and my kid is better enough to go to school and I go to work. The afternoon rolls in and I feel the incredible urge to text my friend at 2:10pm and ask how she is. She didn't respond, so I just went on about my day. At around 3:30pm I got a call from my mother in law asking if I could pick up my kid, since she was supposed to, and she sounded concerned and told me she needed to go find her husband, who she has been separated from for over a year but has stayed friends with him. At 5pm I got a text from her asking me to go over to her house and hangout until she got home, to hangout with her son and wait for her to get home. On our way over there, I forgot the keys to their house so me and my kid had to turn around and walk back to our house to get them. On our way back, I saw a huge bird fly over our heads and land on the cables across the street from our apartment. It faced us, and once I got a good look at it, I noticed it was an owl. Out of every bird it could've been, an owl is what came out at barely 5:30pm on a Monday night. I thought it was so cool to see an owl for the first time in person out in the wild, so I took a video of it and we went and grabbed the keys and went about our way to my mother in laws. While we waited, my brother in law got a call from his boss who knew all of us and told him that he was sorry, and that's when we found out that my father in law was shot and passed away at 2:10pm. When I heard this news, that bad feeling I'd been having for 3 days at this point, slowly faded away. 

My sister in law looked up what an owl could mean, and it's something to do with being a death omen. Not 100% sure on that, I didn't look it up at all.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

After LOTS of hurdles & unexpected (and very expensive) challenges, we are FINALLY launching our coffee shop tomorrow at 139 Bank Street: The EveryPerson Caf√© (Or EP Caf√©).

We have some spectacular murals on the wall created by our resident artist (He's been working diligently over the past 6 weeks to help us create a magical space).

**Some details:**

1. We are utilizing a Victoria Arduino Eagle One Coffee Machine - Absolutely spectacular machine that will be extremely competitive in the Ottawa area for those of you who look for premium quality in your espresso
2. We have public wifi & LOTS of plugs for remote workers, freelancers, and anyone who needs a fun change of scenery while browing.
3. We are open weekdays from 7 AM to 8 PM and weekends from 9 AM to 5 PM - We are confident that downtown residents have a need for an evening-friendly cafe, so let's put it to the test!
4. We are still adding additional items over the next couple of weeks as we ramp up so expect lots of pleasant changes, including more furniture, plants, and much much more.
5. We will have breakfast & lunch items available! There may also be samples featured through the afternoon tomorrow.
6. We are working with Olga's Deli & Strawberry Blonde Bakery as our primary suppliers for food.
7. We are working with Brown Bag Coffee Roasters as our primary supplier for coffee beans & materials.
8. Moving forward, there are lots of things we want to do over 2025, including becoming fully accessible (we haven't accomplished this yet due to the enormous cost and work required), offering specialty food items made especially in-house, offering an expanded vegan and allergy-friendly menu.
9. Not everything will be ready one day 1 (including some food/baked goods), but we will slowly ramp things up over the next few days as we open, and you are guaranteed a great cup of coffee :) 

  
We want this to be more than just your corner coffee shop (but it can be that if that's all you want!), we are a community gathering space: a place for artists to explore and share their creativity, a spot for musicians to show their talent during open mic.  
  
**I would love to get continued feedback from you! If you'd like to help us with any community events, send a DM :)**

You are all cordially invited for our first day tomorrow! I would also love all the feedback (good, bad, ugly, it will be super important for us to address it in these first few weeks)

Follow us on social to keep track of our upcoming holiday events.

**Anyways, the EP Caf√© is really just missing on major thing now, and that's YOU.**",1,1734563039.0,u_Daniy95,0,1.0,False

The conversation was great, we were making playful banter and what not, and he opened his phone to show me something as I sat up to readjust myself on the bench. I noticed he hid his screen a bit from me, and while sitting back down I said it was P HUB quickly being closed. Not even a video, but the logo is recognizable from afar. I could tell he was panicking thinking I saw it, so I just continued on with the convo like nothing happened. 
It‚Äôs kinda weird that it also did the opposite of shove me away, because of my last relationship I forgot that it‚Äôs pretty normal for guys to watch porn. My ex was very judgy (although I‚Äôm sure his browser would look the same) plus just an hour prior to this happening we were looking at vintage playboys together. I don‚Äôt know, it definitely scared me for a second. But now that I‚Äôve sat with it for a bit I still really like this guy and hopefully will continue to see him.

**Memory transcription subject: Quinlim, Suspected Capozzi Family Associate**



Date *\[standardised human time\]:* October 7th, 2136



I‚Äôm jittery, positively electrified as I pace the floor, ‚ÄúStop! No! Up! Back! To the Left! Careful!‚Äù



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it Quinlim,‚Äù Mac flashes me a confident grin from his scar-split lips as he and Ivan bring the couch in through the doorway, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got this handled. Just sit back and relax. We‚Äôre almost done.‚Äù



So far the move-in process had gone off without any issues and, where once my new apartment had been a perfect mirror to Trilvri‚Äôs barren abode, now it was slowly beginning to fill up with moving boxes and old furniture. Already it was beginning to feel more like a ‚ÄòHome‚Äô. In truth, I‚Äôm not really concerned about the guys breaking anything. They‚Äôve proven themselves more than capable of the task, hauling around furniture and giant stacks of boxes with the ease expected from a pack of giant predatory aliens. No, my jitters aren‚Äôt anxiety, but excitement and anticipation. Before we‚Äôd started unloading the truck, the guys had promised me that once we were done they would finally tell me about their pasts. They may have brushed their personal histories aside as inconsequential, but I can tell that each of them has a story to tell. What can I say? As a kid I‚Äôd always loved storytime!



At long last the couch makes its way through the doorway unscathed, coming down to rest gently in the middle of the living room alongside a few other chairs and centered around a small table. Once I can get myself a nice holovision it would make for a great place to watch movies and entertain guests, but for now it‚Äôll still serve as a great ‚Äòsocial circle‚Äô for us to have our conversation around.



Jonesy and Trilvri step inside immediately after, each of them carrying a single box.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time you two stopped clogging up the doorway,‚Äù Jonesy playfully jabs at the other two as he places his burden down in the pile alongside all the rest, ‚ÄúI thought we were gonna be waiting out there in the hallway all day!‚Äù



‚ÄúThese are the last of the boxes,‚Äù Trilvri adds. ‚ÄúWould you like help unpacking them?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I say with an appreciative wave of my tail, ‚Äúbut thank you. Now that everything‚Äôs inside I can handle the rest by myself, work at it over the next few paws. You guys have done more than enough. Thank you again. This would have taken all paw if I had to do it myself.‚Äù



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it Quinlim,‚Äù Ivan says as he dips into the kitchen, returning momentarily with a case of beer he‚Äôd retrieved from the fridge. ‚ÄúNow that we‚Äôre done though, that means it‚Äôs time to celebrate. To your new home!‚Äù



He tosses out a helping of cans with a casual accuracy which, while common to humans, still never ceases to amaze me. Everyone else catches theirs with ease, even Trilvri somehow, but I find myself struggling to make out the proper depth perception of the oncoming projectile, fumbling the catch and only just barely managing to avoid dropping it on the floor.¬†



‚ÄúTo my new home!‚Äù I say, raising the can up high and cracking open the beer as we all toast.



The brew is fairly mild as far as alcohol goes, but of exceptional quality and refined taste, nothing less than I would expect from something produced in our very own *Drunken Venlil Distillery*. This batch may only be of Human strength, but I know well enough from personal experience that even these would be enough to knock a Venlil on their ass after enough of them, something remarkably easy to do given how smoothly they go down.



With beer in paw, I plop myself down onto the couch, allowing all the tension in my body to flow out of me as I sink into the well-worn plush cushions. Mac and Jonesy join me soon after, taking up positions on either side of me on the couch, while Trilvri and Ivan each claim an armchair for themselves.



‚ÄúYou said it Quinlim,‚Äù Mac says, resting his feet up on top of the table, ‚Äúnothing quite like kicking back and relaxing after a good day's work.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou really shouldn‚Äôt put your feet on top of the coffee table like that,‚Äù Ivan gently admonishes, ‚Äúit‚Äôs rude.‚Äù



‚ÄúAh, shit!‚Äù Mac quickly scrambles to remedy the unintended discourtesy. ‚ÄúSorry about that!‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù I say, placing my own feet up on the table for good measure. ‚ÄúMake yourselves at home. I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù



Mac places his feet back up on the table, shooting Ivan a smug look of victory.



‚ÄúSince we‚Äôre making ourselves at home then‚Ä¶‚Äù Ivan says, pulling out a small lighter and a pack of his cigarettes, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose you‚Äôd mind if I-‚Äù



‚ÄúNo smoking inside,‚Äù Trilvri cuts him off. ‚ÄúLandlady‚Äôs rules, and even she isn‚Äôt exempt from them. If you really need your fix, then open up a window and stick your head outside so you don‚Äôt let any of the smoke in here.‚Äù



Ivan glances outside, where the freezing windstorm continues to rage, before tucking his cigarettes back into his pocket, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just hold off for now then. It‚Äôs fine.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù I slowly ease back into my main point as we all settle in, ‚Äúnow that we‚Äôre done moving me in‚Ä¶ I was promised storytime. Time for you guys to tell me all about yourselves, all the deep, dark, embarrassing secrets!‚Äù



Jonesy chuckles aloud, ‚ÄúYes, I suppose you were, weren‚Äôt you? Mac, why don‚Äôt you start us off? You wanted to go first anyway, right?‚Äù



‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Mac clears his throat as he begins, ‚ÄúI suppose I can go first. Nothing much to say about me though. I was raised in a fairly typical American household in the downtown of a city known as ‚ÄòBoston‚Äô; got a mother who was always as quick to scold as she was to help me out of whatever mess I‚Äôd gotten myself into, a father as big and broad as an oak with as gentle a soul as you‚Äôd ever met, and two older brothers, Connor and Sean. The Cutler clan runs an old Irish Pub going on three generations now, *Cutler and Son‚Äôs*, but back in the day I never really appreciated that; too preoccupied with‚Ä¶ youthful indiscretion. Getting into fights, drinking until I would black out, sowing my oats with women whose names I don‚Äôt even remember, and causing my poor mother no end of headache. Connor took up most of the responsibility for the pub, he was always the responsible one, and Sean found himself a wife and started up a band to tour with, but me? I was a real hellion, a wastrel without a purpose beyond my own hedonistic pleasure.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo what happened?‚Äù I ask, my ears tilting with curiosity. ‚ÄúYou might be a bit wild, but the Mac I know isn‚Äôt nearly as crazy as all that.‚Äù



‚ÄúThirty-two happened,‚Äù Mac says with a wide smile, his scars pulling taut across his face.



‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶ The fight of thirty-two?‚Äù I clarify after a moment, scrounging around in the depths of my memory for the off-handed remark that seems so distant now, back when I‚Äôd just met the gang.



‚ÄúThe very same,‚Äù Mac answers. ‚ÄúIt was New Year's day, and if you know anything about New Year‚Äôs then you know you celebrate by getting absolutely wasted, but on that day I had a very particular reason. Y‚Äôsee, back in the day I fancied myself to be something of a contender, the next great up-and-comer to the squared circle. Professional boxing. I was pretty good at it too, lots of practice getting into scraps working as a bouncer for the pub, but the problem was that I never made it out of the amateur league. Too much time spent partying and not enough time dedicated to the art. So, when I finally got my one shot at the big-leagues as a preliminary fighter before the New Year‚Äôs Eve headliner match, I blew it. I made it all the way to the eighth round. I could practically taste victory on the tip of my tongue, but I wasn‚Äôt just fighting my opponent, I was fighting the hangover from my previous night out on the town. Celebrating my *victory* before I‚Äôd even started the match. I didn‚Äôt even see the right-hook coming before it knocked me flat to the canvas, and just like that the dream was over.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo that punch is why you have that metal plate in your head?‚Äù



‚ÄúNot quite,‚Äù Mac chuckles, ‚Äúthough it would have made for a better headline if it had. No, that came after as I was drowning my sorrows. Y‚Äôsee, that was my second major mistake. After my public humiliation I couldn‚Äôt face my own family, the rage and the shame was just too much, so I went somewhere else to drink, somewhere on the far side of town. Ran into a few of my old mates out there while I was pissed off and hammered. It was my third mistake thinking that they were ever really my friends, and they were mighty upset with me for losing that match! You see, they‚Äôd put a lot of money on me winning and I‚Äôd cost them. I‚Äôm not even sure who threw the first punch, me or them, but I know the end result.‚Äù¬†



Mac gestures to his face, emphasizing the myriad lines of scars running all across it.



‚ÄúI woke up in the hospital, my mother crying over my bedside and my head wrapped up so tightly in bandages that I couldn‚Äôt even see, but I could hear the pain in her voice. The pain I‚Äôd caused. It was right then and there that I decided I needed to make a change in my life, to do something worthwhile for once, to make her proud of me.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ You joined the UN?‚Äù



‚ÄúRight on the mark, Quinlim!‚Äù Mac snaps his fingers, pointing directly at me. ‚ÄúNothing like military life to straighten out a rotten son like me, or at least that was the idea. As it turns out, it was just what I needed, and I managed to find a use for what was left of my brain after all. I became a CBRNE specialist, serving for a real purpose, keeping people safe.‚Äù



‚ÄúSea burn?‚Äù I ask, giving my ears a slight tilt to the side. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an acronym,‚Äù Mac answers with pride, laughing all the while. ‚ÄúStands for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives! The real big guns, the war-crime division! Or rather, we specialize in stopping, preventing the use of, and cleaning up the aftermath of weapons of mass destruction like those.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs insane!‚Äù I shout. ‚ÄúAftermath? What kind of a person would even think of using something like a biological weapon? How would that even work? You can‚Äôt just‚Ä¶ **aim** biology at people, and no sapient would be self-destructive enough to use nuclear weapons on their own planet! You‚Äôd wind up killing yourselves just as much as you would whatever you were trying to attack!‚Äù



Mac just shrugs, an utterly disproportionate response to the casual horrors he‚Äôd just revealed, ‚ÄúNo sapient except for Humanity then, I suppose; because we **have** developed those weapons and we **have** used them before, against our own people no less. Maybe it‚Äôs just a side-effect of our ‚Äòpredatory nature‚Äô but they‚Äôre real, and we‚Äôve had to go through a lot of growing pains as a species learning how to put all those evils back into their box.‚Äù



I just give a shake of the head, dislodging all the troublesome thoughts that had grown and accumulated there. It‚Äôs Human nature to be frightfully‚Ä¶ excessive like this. It‚Äôs just another aspect of them I‚Äôve gradually come to accept. There‚Äôs no sense in worrying overly much about it.¬†



‚ÄúAs I was saying‚Ä¶‚Äù Mac continues. ‚ÄúWhen humanity stumbled across Venlil Prime I obviously didn‚Äôt meet the strict criteria demanded to be an actual exchange participant, too much of my checkered past coming back to bite me, but I did manage to leverage my expertise and my sob story to get a place aboard Prime Station as a technical support specialist. For just a brief period I became the most important janitor in all the world!‚Äù Mac breaks into a boisterous laugh shared by all before quieting back down. ‚ÄúIn all seriousness the selection boards do love a nice redemption arc, they say it shows growth and character, plus it‚Äôs always good to have someone aboard who knows how to handle a worst-case scenario. We didn‚Äôt know exactly what we‚Äôd be walking into in terms of potential threats, intentional or not,¬† and the last thing we wanted was for one or both of us to wind up dead over something as stupid as a viral contagion.‚Äù



‚ÄúAlright, well‚Ä¶‚Äù I take a moment to gather myself before carrying on, ‚ÄúThanks for sharing, Mac. I may have trouble sleeping this rest claw after that bit about apocalyptic weapons of mass destruction, but I appreciate you sharing your story with me. It means a lot that you‚Äôd open up like that.‚Äù



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sweat it Quinlim,‚Äù Mac pats me on the shoulder before taking another swig of his beer, ‚Äúyou guys are like brothers to me. I‚Äôve got no reason to keep secrets. Now, Ivan! Why don‚Äôt you go next?‚Äù



Ivan gives a small sigh, ‚ÄúI suppose I might as well get it over with, though I don‚Äôt much care for talking about myself. It‚Äôs so much easier when you just let other people do the talking, let them lead the conversation and more often than not they‚Äôll tell you everything you need to know about them without you ever really needing to say a thing. People are funny like that, self-centered, and most don‚Äôt even notice. Really, the key to being a good conversationalist is knowing how to shut up and listen more than anything else.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright Ivan,‚Äù I relent with a slightly disappointed droop of the tail, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to tell me anything if you don‚Äôt want to. I understand.‚Äù



Ivan just gives a slightly agitated groan before turning back to me, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not like that. I‚Äôll tell you my story, it's just that it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not quite so happy as Mac‚Äôs.‚Äù



‚ÄúMac‚Äôs story was happy?‚Äù I ask, genuinely bewildered at how any story in which you almost die could be considered ‚Äòhappy‚Äô.



‚ÄúYes, it was,‚Äù Ivan answers before delving into his own history. ‚ÄúTo start with I‚Äôm a bastard, born out of wedlock, and a native son of mother Russia, raised in the gutters of Moscow. My father was a powerful man, an influential oligarch of the ruling class with connections that ran deep, and my mother? My mother was just a simple working girl, a lady of the night who caught my fathers attention one evening and had the grave misfortune of mistaking his carnal affections for something more. He made so many promises to her, and in the end that‚Äôs all she was left with, empty promises‚Ä¶ and me.‚Äù¬†



A shock ripples through me as I begin to understand just why Ivan could claim that Mac‚Äôs upbringing was happy, ‚ÄúYou mean‚Ä¶ You mean your father just‚Ä¶ Just‚Ä¶ **Left you!** You and your mother all alone? Didn‚Äôt he care? Didn‚Äôt he have a responsibility to take care of his own family?‚Äù



‚ÄúNot so far as he saw it evidently, or at least not as it applied to my mother and I. His own family, his legitimate one, I can‚Äôt quite say for certain, but it was years until I met the man myself. Until then, I grew up in the cathouse where my mother worked-‚Äù



‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù I raise a paw and interject with a question. ‚ÄúSorry to interrupt, but what is a ‚Äòlady of the night‚Äô and what is a ‚ÄòCathouse‚Äô exactly? The words aren‚Äôt translating well and I don‚Äôt quite understand the context.‚Äù



Ivan doesn‚Äôt seem the least put-off by my queries, ‚ÄúA ‚ÄòLady of the night‚Äô is one of many euphemisms to describe a ‚ÄòProstitute‚Äô, someone who sells sexual services in exchange for money. A ‚ÄòCathouse‚Äô is a slang term used to describe their place of business, also referred to as a ‚ÄòBrothel‚Äô.‚Äù



I don‚Äôt want to be rude to my friend, but the concept is unsettling to me. Perverse, and a violation of common decency, of the sanctity of love and the sacred union between two people. The unsanitary nature of such‚Ä¶ *close contact* shared among so many strangers is itself utterly disgusting and repugnant. Who would ever want to do something like that for a living? After long enough could someone like that even feel love anymore, or was every act strictly business, strictly‚Ä¶ transactional?



‚ÄúIs that‚Ä¶ Is that a‚Ä¶ *Normal* profession among Humans, or‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an **honoured** profession, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking,‚Äù Ivan cuts off my mutterings, quick and to the point, ‚Äúbut it **is** considered to be the **oldest** Human profession. Humans can, at times, be a rather depraved lot, and often the quickest way to get what you want is simply to pay for it. There is no shame in fulfilling a need, however, or in doing what you need to in order to feed your family.‚Äù



‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù I say politely, but lacking conviction. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶ That doesn‚Äôt seem like the best environment in which to raise a child.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt probably wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù Ivan shrugs. ‚ÄúI heard and saw a lot of things that children rightfully shouldn‚Äôt at that age, but we made the best of what we had available to us, and it wasn‚Äôt all bad. I may not have had a real father, but I did have a lot of aunts. My mothers coworkers helped look after me like I was their own. In a way you could say I was ‚Äòraised by the village‚Äô. They taught me all sorts of things: how the world really worked, how to hold myself with confidence, to listen with intent, to say things in a way that made others listen, and how to spot murder in a man by the look of his eye. I was a bright kid, a quick study with my letters and maths, and it wasn‚Äôt long before I was helping out with the business, managing the books and the appointments for the house under the supervision of the headmistress to pay my way. It was an unusual childhood, but it wasn‚Äôt necessarily a bad one.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo what changed?‚Äù I ask, dreading the answer to come.



‚ÄúMy father came back,‚Äù Ivan says with distaste, venom oozing from between his lips, ‚Äúnot out of any sudden familial urges mind you, but out of simple happenstance, and he was none too happy to discover that he‚Äôd fathered a bastard during his last visit. My mother was certain that he‚Äôd finally returned for her after making it big, that he would whisk her away to a better life like he‚Äôd promised all those years ago, but instead she found him in bed being serviced by one of my aunts, making the same old, tired promises as before.‚Äù



Ivan finishes off his drink and reaches for another to replace it, the hiss of the can drawing out the long pause as I wait, enraptured.



‚ÄúThen what happened?‚Äù I ask, eager to know more.



‚ÄúMy mother was incensed of course,‚Äù Ivan continues, ‚Äúutterly beside herself as the fanciful dream she‚Äôd held onto like a lifeline for years crumbled away to dust before her eyes. If it had happened earlier then maybe that would have been the end of it, no one cares about the ravings of a delusional, heartbroken whore afterall, but she did have one thing over my father, one bit of leverage. She had me, and by that point the resemblance was undeniable. She tried to appeal to his nonexistent sense of honour, she tried to extort him, threatened to expose him to his wife, to ruin him both personally and politically. All she really wanted was a payoff, enough money to set us up good for the rest of our lives, but in that moment I saw the look in my fathers eye and I knew. It would be cleaner, easier, and cheaper for him to simply kill us.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù I exclaimed, not believing what I‚Äôd just heard with my own ears. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way! There‚Äôs no way a father would ever consider doing that to their own child! That‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ Predatory beyond predatory! Evil!‚Äù



‚ÄúEvil indeed,‚Äù Ivan smirks, ‚Äúbut that didn‚Äôt stop him from trying. As soon as he left so did my mother and I, knowing that our clock was ticking before he‚Äôd send his men after us. We crossed over the Ukrainian border in the dead of night, just trying to put distance between him and us. We took up new names, new identities, and for a little while we thought we were safe. Word reached us that he‚Äôd sent a few toughs to poke around the old cathouse, looking for us, but we‚Äôd made it out just in time. What we hadn‚Äôt anticipated was his persistence. Not long after we started noticing things; strange men with dark eyes walking around the neighborhood, asking questions, following us, looking into the windows of our apartment building. It was at that point it became clear we had a lot further to run.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhere did you go?‚Äù I ask.



‚ÄúWhere **didn‚Äôt** we go?‚Äù Ivan replies with a wave of the hand. ‚ÄúBelarus, Lithuania, Poland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, India, China, France, England, Brazil, Argentina! More places than I care to count. By the time I was eighteen I‚Äôd travelled around half the fucking world, immersed myself into the language and cultures of more countries than I had years, and we never stayed in the same place for more than a few months at a time.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat happened to your father?‚Äù I put forward the question with a growing feeling of paranoia running up my spine. ‚ÄúIs he still out there somewhere? Still chasing you even now?‚Äù



‚ÄúNot unless he‚Äôs doing so from beyond the grave,‚Äù Ivan gives a smug, self-satisfied smile. ‚ÄúRight around the time I came of age, my father finally pulled the trigger on his true ambitions. Years in the making were spent plotting and conspiring, leveraging favours, playing power politics, all for a failed coup d'etat of the Russian Federation. He spent the last of his days freezing in the bowels of a Siberian prison, and from what I hear, he died like a dog with a shiv in his back after an altercation over dinner scraps.



‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù I say with an uneasy gulp, ‚Äúwhere did that leave you and your mother?‚Äù



‚ÄúBy that time we‚Äôd fled all the way to the United States of America and secured ourselves a protected status as political refugees. My mother only ever knew one trade, but all those years spent on the run had taken their toll. She couldn‚Äôt cut it as a working girl anymore, so she moved into management. These days she‚Äôs still in America, a headmistress running her own cathouse just outside a city called Vegas. As for me, I was an adult and it was time for me to make it on my own and provide for myself. While I had a lot of worldly experience, I was only passing at best in terms of formal education. I signed up for UN armed service as quickly as I could, a means to secure myself a better future, and a way for me to put my unique skill set to use. I enlisted as just a basic Peacekeeper, quickly qualified as a multi-cultural interpreter, and after an incident in South Sudan involving a band of separatist guerillas and the local embassy I was promoted to a full-time crisis negotiator. When we made contact with the Venlil I made it all the way to the final selection process before getting denied for a partner. As spotless as my own record was, my family was another matter entirely. Still, I managed well enough to secure a position as a guard aboard the station, one of the few public facing roles that allowed me to interact with your people in at least a limited capacity.‚Äù



‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶‚Äù I struggled to put out the words, my mind still boggled by everything Ivan had gone through and everything he had overcome, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry to hear that you had such a rough start to life, but at the same time I‚Äôm really impressed by everything you‚Äôve managed to accomplish despite that! I don‚Äôt know how you did it. Your own father turning on you like that? It‚Äôs unthinkable. Thank you so much for talking about it, even if you didn‚Äôt want to.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine Quinlim,‚Äù Ivan turns aside, brushing aside my thanks with a projection of stoic indifference, ‚Äúif there‚Äôs one thing a whore-son learns quickly, it‚Äôs to not let something as harmless as words get to them‚Ä¶ but thanks. Now, Jonesy! I believe it‚Äôs your turn on this fucking merry-go-round.¬†



Beside me, Jonesy gives a small nod and smiles as brightly as his blond hair, ‚ÄúGladly. Thanks for being a good sport Ivan.‚Äù



Ivan gives a small grunt, ‚ÄúSure thing. I‚Äôm not about to rain on everybody else‚Äôs parade, and it was worth being said anyway. A man oughta know his brother's story.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Jonesy claps his hands together, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt promise that my story will be as exciting as Mac or Ivan‚Äôs, but I‚Äôll give it my best shot. Frankly, compared to just about everyone else here I had a rather privileged upbringing. My dad was a defence attorney who was a partner in a large, high-powered legal practice on the beaches of Los Angeles and my mom was a homemaker. I have three younger sisters, Julia, Janice, and Joanna-‚Äù



I raise a paw to ask a question, but before I can get it out Jonesy answers it for me.



‚Äú-and yes, our parents **did** decide to give us all names starting with ‚ÄòJ‚Äô. Apparently they thought it would be cute.‚Äù



I lower my paw with a chuckle and allow Jonesy to continue uninterrupted.



‚ÄúAs I was saying, we were for all intents and purposes, rich. We had all the money we could want and not a care in the world. I had the best schooling, and the best opportunities afforded to me that a kid could ask for, but in hindsight I was remarkably unappreciative of what I had. I just didn‚Äôt know any different at the time, I suppose. How could I? The world was handed to me on a shining silver platter and as far as I was concerned that was the natural state of things.‚Äù



A small dark pit of unease begins to gnaw in my stomach, ‚ÄúWhy do I get the impression that things didn‚Äôt **stay** that idyllic?‚Äù



Jonesy just chuckles at me and ruffles the wool on top of my head, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting there, buddy. Just hold your horses.‚Äù



‚ÄúHorses?‚Äù I ask.



‚ÄúJust an expression,‚Äù Jonesy explains, ‚Äúit means ‚Äòto wait‚Äô. Like I was saying, I was a pretty free spirit, or as my dad would describe it, lazy and lacking in focus on what was important in life. We were rich, and we would always be rich, so I suppose I just didn‚Äôt see the point in putting in effort, of applying myself to anything I didn‚Äôt see as worthwhile. The one thing I **did** see as worthwhile really were my athletics, particularly classical fencing.‚Äù



‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I say, ‚Äúyou did mention before that you‚Äôd had a lot of lessons on historical swordsmanship before, didn‚Äôt you? That‚Äôs why you tend to help out Alfonse and lead the weapons drills at the gym, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù



‚ÄúYep,‚Äù Jonesy nods his head, ‚Äúthere was a pretty big revival of classical martial arts in the late twenty-first century, one that did away with a lot of the ahistorical sporting elements that had been degrading the efficacy of the art forms. Saber is my preferred weapon, but I‚Äôm also well-versed in stiletto and I dabble in foil, epee, longsword, and spadone among others.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúThat does seem like a lot of time to put into mastering obsolete weaponry,‚Äù I wonder aloud. ‚ÄúWhy not put that effort into something more modern? More‚Ä¶ practical?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre sounding like my dad!‚Äù Jonesy chuckles softly. ‚ÄúYou should understand well enough at this point though that exercise is valuable in its own right. Sure, something like competition shooting may have proven more practical given my eventual line of work, but I enjoyed the **sport** of fencing. There‚Äôs something primal in it, something‚Ä¶ Heroic. It makes me feel like a swashbuckling knight of old, off to slay a dragon and save a princess. And besides, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with having a hobby.‚Äù



‚ÄúI take it your dad wasn‚Äôt very supportive of your hobby though?‚Äù



‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt get me wrong, he was supportive enough. He made an effort to attend my matches, even if the nature of his work meant he couldn‚Äôt make all of them, and he understood that I could be doing far worse things with my time. He just wished that I would put the same passion into my studies, follow in his footsteps and take over the practice some day. That just wasn‚Äôt for me though. I‚Äôd seen what his work had done to him, and I knew that I didn‚Äôt want that for myself.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo what **did** you want then?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúDid you always plan to join the UN?‚Äù



Jonesy gives me a wry smile, ‚ÄúNo, of course not! I had ambitions of winning gold at the Olympics, the competition where all the best athletes from around the world gather to see who‚Äôs the best of the best in their field! If you actually manage to win a medal for your home country it‚Äôs a big deal and you can absolutely make a career off of it. The thing is that the competition is fierce, the open positions limited, and it takes a lot of money just to put yourself in the running in the first place. Being an olympian isn‚Äôt cheap. Sure, there are private committees to help offset some costs, but you still have to pay your own way and you don‚Äôt earn **any** money unless you actually make it all the way and win. Luckily for me my dad had that covered. It was hard work, but I actually did manage to secure a position for myself on the US classical fencing team, you know? I think that was the first time my dad actually took a genuine interest in my hobby, the first time he recognized that it could be something more, that I could find success taking a different path than he did.‚Äù



My eyes widen at the sudden reveal, ‚ÄúYou mean to tell me that you‚Äôve been famous this whole time? How did the competition go? Did you win?‚Äù



Jonesy struggles to hold back from laughing, ‚ÄúMe, famous? Hardly. No one knows who I am unless they‚Äôre **exceptionally** dedicated to the sport. No, I had to drop out from the team at the last minute. I never actually made it to the Olympics in the end. Financial constraints and mounting problems at home made that impossible.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù I almost couldn‚Äôt believe my ears. ‚ÄúYou **just** finished talking about how your dad was supporting you, how you had more money than you knew what to do with! What happened!‚Äù



‚ÄúCancer,‚Äù Jonesy sighs, taking a deep drink from his beer before continuing, ‚Äúcancer happened. Just a few months before I was set to leave for the competition my dad had a seizure, completely unexpected and right in the middle of his office. It was a good thing one of his junior associates was staying late that evening or no one would have found him until the following monday, and by then it would have been too late. The doctors at the hospital figured out he had a glioblastoma, an incurable and aggressive form of brain cancer.‚Äù



‚ÄúIncurable?‚Äù My heart aches in sympathy and my mind immediately flashes back to thoughts of my own mother, lying helpless in her hospital bed. ‚ÄúNo, no, that can‚Äôt be right. We‚Äôve known how to cure cancer for centuries! There must be some sort of mistake.‚Äù



‚ÄúI wish,‚Äù Jonesy says with a sad smile, ‚Äúbut Humanity didn‚Äôt have Zurulian medicine back then. We‚Äôre only catching up to the rest of the galaxy in that respect **now**. If we had just made contact a few years earlier then my dad would probably still be alive. It was quick at least, but watching the man I knew waste away, becoming someone else as his own brain slowly killed him‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt wish that on anybody.‚Äù



‚ÄúOh Jonesy,‚Äù I reach over and give him a hug, feeling the tears welling up in my own eyes, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. It‚Äôs just not fair.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright Quinlim,‚Äù Jonesy pats me on the back and I let go, allowing him to carry on, ‚Äúthough I may wish things had been different, I‚Äôve made my peace with it. That‚Äôs just how life is sometimes.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, it shouldn‚Äôt be.‚Äù I say, somewhat petulantly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not right.‚Äù



The room goes silent for a few moments, each of us clearly thinking about ways in which our own lives could have gone differently, before Jonesy continues.



‚ÄúAfter my dad died, my family lost our only source of income. We had some savings, but as much as I love my mom she shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to manage her own finances let alone those of the entire family. We were broke before you knew it. It was up to me to man up, to become the breadwinner of the household, and so I did what I had to do. I gave up on my olympic aspirations, took charge of our family finances, and got myself an officer position working for the UN military. I dug deep, and for the first time in my life I was pushing myself, not because I wanted to, not because it was fun, but because I had to. Because it was my responsibility and my duty to take care of my family.‚Äù



‚ÄúI know the feeling‚Ä¶‚Äù I say as I finish up the last of my own beer. ‚ÄúNo matter what it takes, you do it for the people you love, right?‚Äù



‚ÄúDamn right, Quinlim.‚Äù Jonesy answers, a hard look in his eyes. ‚ÄúI did well in the military, all that education and all that exercise paid off for something at least, and I managed to make rank as a special tactics officer. All put together, I managed to salvage enough of our finances to send Janice off to law school, so I‚Äôd say it was worth it in the end. When we stumbled upon Venlil Prime of course, I was as excited as anybody and I signed up for the exchange right away. Didn‚Äôt make it in of course, but I knew enough people in high places to land me a spot aboard the technical support staff. Good thing too, because as it turned out there was a dire need for people with combat control operator training aboard Prime Station. I helped manage stellar-traffic control during the Arxur attack.‚Äù



‚ÄúI doubt those spineless VSC officers aboard Prime Station had ever even seen real combat,‚Äù Trilvri cuts in with cold, derisive spite. ‚ÄúWorthless, the lot of them. If it wasn‚Äôt for the Humans then the whole station would have been overrun. Don‚Äôt let Jonesy fool you, he was almost single-handedly managing our entire communications array while **our** officers were off crying in a corner having a panic attack.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat might be a bit harsh, Trilvri,‚Äù Jonesy says.



‚ÄúAm I wrong though?‚Äù Trilvri counters.



The silence that follows is his answer.



I‚Äôm tempted to use this opportunity to ask Trilvri more about his own past, to finally open up and join the rest of us in sharing, but I know well enough to understand that's not going to happen. Not yet anyway. Now isn‚Äôt the time to press him for details, but I imagine I‚Äôll have plenty of opportunity to learn more about my new neighbor in the future. Maybe if I bake him some strayu first?



‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I finally say in an attempt to lighten the mood, unwilling to tolerate the melancholic quiet any longer, ‚Äúthank you for sharing Jonesy. Despite your doubts, I think your story was just as impactful as everyone else's and the part about your dad really reminded me of my situation with my own mother. Thank you again, all of you, for humoring me and having this big ‚Äòheart-to-heart‚Äô as Mac put it. I think things may have taken a bit of a darker and more serious tone than I had originally intended, but I feel like it was important nonetheless, and I enjoyed listening all the same. Still, this was **meant** to be a celebration and things have taken on a rather dour mood. Let‚Äôs fix that, shall we? We‚Äôre out of beer and it‚Äôs time to eat, so why don‚Äôt we all head down to the Speakeasy and continue this party there? What do you say?‚Äù



Every member of the gang looks to one another and back again, locking eyes for just a moment as though passing secret missives to one another using only their minds. As a collective moving in synchronicity they arise and make their way towards the door.



‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Jonesy says, ‚ÄúThat sounds great.‚Äù



‚ÄúI could go for some food,‚Äù Mac adds.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm overdue for a smoke break myself,‚Äù Ivan chimes in.



As we all exit the apartment and I lock up behind us, Trilvri speaks up, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll drive.‚Äù



Remembering my last car ride with Trilvri at the wheel, a small hint of fear creeps into my voice, ‚ÄúWould uh‚Ä¶ Would anyone else like to drive, maybe? Anyone?‚Äù



Not a man among them speaks up.



‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶?‚Äù I ask, ushering a silent prayer to the Protector above for my own safe travels, ‚ÄúOk then‚Ä¶‚Äù

Last time my gp just did a blood test and found me vitamine d deficient. I'm tired of being tired all the time. They used to just say oh you're just depressed but i've been not depressed and the exhaustion never leaves


Symptoms:
Shoulder blades muscle tightness,
Pain underneath shoulder blades.
Morning stiffness muscles all over
Fever like feeling in muscles legs
Burning feeling in muscles daily
Daytime fatigue

Last holiday after 2 days of walking I was physically incapable of moving. Last major holiday we just rented a wheelchair because I couldnt walk large areas without pain.

Other diagnosis:
Unexplained urine retention for years (i self catherize - from urologist, weak bladder. Also ptsd from sexual abuse.)
Ibs: now regular stool thanks to vitamin d increase and coffee.

When I had duloxetine from my gp it took most of my daily muscle pain, the side effects were too bad to keep taking it. I feel like its a chicken or egg thing. If i woke up without pain and with energy I'd be able to do more, focus. I dont feel depression depressed. I just feel unfocused, unable to concentrate. Too tired to function. It's not lack of motivation or unwillingness.

Her kid is around 7 weeks old now and yesterday I met up with her for coffee to talk about how mom life was going.

It seems she's decided to ignore all modern recommendations for safe sleep and baby care and has bragged that she's ""raising her baby like it's the 90s"". For one, her LO sleeps in a Dock-A-Tot in the bassinet with blankets and stuffed animals. At the hospital, the nurses stressed to only place baby in an empty flat bassinet with nothing in it. I brought this up to her and she said that her son didn't like the bassinet and only slept well in the lounger.

l also mentioned my struggle to do housework with a newborn and she said she just puts her son down for naps and lets him cry it out while she gets chores done. She lives in a split level house so I guess she can easily ignore his crying. She does the same thing for nighttime and puts him down at 8 at night and he sleeps through the night until she comes to get him at 8 in the morning. This is a far cry from where l'm at as my LO wakes every 2 hours at night to eat and needs a lot of help to go back down.

Overall, she seems to have a much easier time with new parenthood than I have. She said she gets plenty of sleep and she doesn't understand what all the fuss is about and that if stopped being so uptight and following the ""unrealistic"" rules that l'd have a much easier time.

I told my boyfriend about it when
came home and he said that it sounds like she's just neglecting her child. But I do wonder if her being well-rested ultimately translates to her being a better mom.
