1mhyqi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mhyqi2/girl_im_crushing_on/,Girl I'm Crushing On,"So there is this girl at a local coffee shop I visit frequently. I have a major issue with getting nervous around girls, especially when I am attracted to them. I can have all the confidence in the world, but as soon as it comes time to spark that conversation I get a wave of anxiety, and then just end up acting disinterested.

Anyway when I first saw this girl, I thought she was cute. Really friendly. But I was actually kind of talking to another girl at the time, so I didn't really think past the ""she's kinda cute"" at the time. Since then things have fallen through with the other one, and I have a weird feeling there could be mutual attraction with the new girl, but I am way too nervous to make that move.

I need the ladies to help me out a bit here haha. So 1 day about a month ago, I went through the drive through, and I intended on asking her out if she was the one waiting on me. Sure enough she was. Wasn't busy. Would have been the perfect opportunity, but I got that wave of anxiety, and I think it was obvious in our interaction lol. The thing is I felt like there was nervous energy from her too. Which kinda had me thinking maybe she likes me too? Naw im just delusional.. Next day shes working, and I went in to order. She wasn't working the cash for the 3 ahead of me, and when I got up to order it seemed like she went out of her way to wait on me and approached me with a big smile that seemed to be out of the ordinary. Like not the same as previous encounters. Again, instead of making some kind of move, my anxiety gets the best of me, and I fail to make that move. Instead acting as if I have no idea shes interested, and probably giving off vibes that im not either. So that was a fail.. Couple days later I went in, and when I was waiting for my drink she again seemed to go out of her way to get next to me cleaning out a machine, and went on to chat up a coworker in a joking manner. Almost felt to me like she was trying to show her playful personality to me, but idk if im just over analyzing things because im crushing on the girl haha.. Like im well aware how delusional dudes can be about girls liking them 😂.. I again let the anxiety get the best of me, and basically acted as if I wasn't even paying attention to her.

After that I wrote my number on a piece of paper to give to her. But every single time I get a chance since I chicken out.. Since that day though, I did notice her being a little less ""flirty"" each interaction after that. It's almost to the point now that it seems like normal customer interactions going on. Am I crazy to think this girl likes me but I have caused her to back off because I am giving off the vibe that I dont like her? Would it be inappropiate to just hand her a paper with my number on it while shes at work? ..... Anxiety fucking sucks man 😅",1,1754365165.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

at one point during the movie, she asked when they were leaving. my parents told her, “after we finish our coffee.” fair enough. but soon they were just glued to their phones, barely paying attention to the movie or to anyone else.

a little while later, she asked again. this time, they told her, “after dinner.” again, sounded fair on the surface. but after dinner, they simply said, “we’re not going.” no explanation. no softness in the tone. just a flat no. and then back to scrolling.

she was crushed. you could see it immediately. she started crying, not throwing a fit, just crying.
and instead of comforting her or offering any kind of explanation, my stepdad snapped. he spoke to her like she was being dramatic, like she should’ve just accepted it and moved on. he started swearing at her, raising his voice, like she was an adult being unreasonable, instead of a child trying to make sense of something that felt unfair.

i couldn’t stay quiet. i told them what i saw. that they made a promise, kept delaying it, then broke it, and reacted with anger when she responded like any kid would. i told them they spend more time scrolling than actually engaging with her or the rest of us, told them that there’s a couch at the soft play too and they could sit there on their phones. when they do engage, it’s usually with shouting too, they didn’t take that well and i got yelled at. told to stay out of their parenting. but i just don’t think that’s parenting at all.

and it’s not just about that one day. this kind of thing happens all the time. she gets scolded constantly, sworn at, ignored. then they go right back to their phones. they blame my grandma who lives with us for various problems with THEIR child, like she’s supposed to be the one parenting her.

[$200-300],"I have been using an ancient Gaggia MDF for years with my Cafelat Robot. The grinder works fairly well, since the Robot is pretty forgiving and doesn't need the most finely-tuned grinds, but having more than 2-3 settings that work for espresso would be nice. Before the MDF, I used an even more ancient Super Jolly. It was obviously much nicer, especially for the more temperamental La Pavoni I used to have, but it was far too big for where I live, and grind adjustment could be tedious.

I usually pull shots with medium to dark roasts, and occasionally also use the grinder for cold brew and V60 pourover.

Since I have a gift card, I'm between two grinders sold by Williams Sonoma. The Encore ESP seems like the obvious choice. Parts on the Baratza grinders are supposed to be pretty easy to replace. 20 steps of espresso adjustment is a big improvement over 2, and the 20 steps for non-espresso coffee would make things easier for my occasional non-espresso coffees.

The Lelit Fred Tempo also seems like a good option, but I can't find much information on it. Lelit build quality is supposed to be excellent, and the Fred Tempo has fully stepless adjustment, which would be nice for espresso. I wouldn't mind holding onto my MDF for non-espresso coffees, though I'd prefer to have just the one grinder. The Lelit also has a timer, which would be helpful, but not an absolute necessity. The Encore ESP burrs are pretty well-reputed, but since there is less overall information on the Lelit, I don't really know how well it grinds.

I'm in the US, so parts availability might also be better with Baratza, since even though they're owned by Breville, they're still located here.

A third possibility would be waiting for the Encore ESP Pro, though I don't know if Williams Sonoma is planning to stock it. The timer and stepless adjustment seem like solid additions. Regardless, definitely want to stick to options sold by Williams Sonoma.

# Best Coffee Packs with Filter [2025 Review]

Coffee packs with filters, also known as coffee bags or single-serve coffee bags, are pre-portioned coffee grounds sealed inside a filter bag, similar to tea bags. They are designed for easy brewing, requiring only hot water and a mug. This innovative solution addresses the need for convenience and portability for coffee lovers, offering a quick and mess-free way to enjoy a freshly brewed cup of coffee anywhere.

Coffee packs with filters stand out in the market due to their simplicity and ease of use, appealing to busy individuals, travelers, and anyone seeking a no-fuss coffee experience. they provide a convenient alternative to customary coffee brewing methods like drip machines or French presses, making them ideal for those with limited time or access to equipment.

## Key Features Analysis

The best coffee packs with filters offer several noteworthy features that contribute to their overall quality and user experience.

**Pre-Portioned Coffee Grounds:** Each pack contains a precisely measured amount of coffee grounds,typically ranging from 8 to 12 grams,ensuring a consistent brew strength every time. This eliminates the need for measuring and reduces the risk of weak or overly strong coffee.The amount of coffee is carefully calibrated to deliver the optimal extraction for a single cup, considering the grind size and coffee type. This consistency is a major advantage for users who value predictable results.

**Integrated Filter Bag:** The coffee grounds are enclosed in a filter bag made of paper or biodegradable materials. The filter is designed to allow hot water to pass through efficiently, extracting the coffee's flavors while preventing grounds from escaping into the cup.

The filter's pore size is crucial,balancing the flow rate with filtration effectiveness. High-quality filters prevent sediment while allowing the full flavor profile of the coffee to be extracted.

**Nitrogen-Flushed packaging:** Many coffee packs are individually wrapped in nitrogen-flushed packaging to maintain freshness and prevent oxidation. This helps preserve the aroma and flavor of the coffee grounds until they are ready to be brewed.

Nitrogen, being an inert gas, displaces oxygen, preventing the coffee from going stale. This is especially meaningful for pre-ground coffee, which loses its freshness more quickly than whole beans.

**Variety of Coffee Blends and Roasts:** Top-rated coffee packs are available in a wide range of blends, roasts, and origins to cater to different taste preferences.From light and fruity blends to dark and bold roasts, there is a coffee pack to suit every palate.

The options often include single-origin coffees, decaffeinated versions, and flavored varieties. This diversity allows users to explore different coffee profiles and find their perfect cup.

**biodegradable and Compostable Options:** Environmentally conscious consumers can opt for coffee packs made with biodegradable or compostable filter bags and packaging. These options minimize environmental impact and contribute to enduring practices.

The materials used in these eco-friendly packs are designed to break down naturally after disposal, reducing landfill waste. This is a growing trend as consumers become more aware of the environmental consequences of single-use products.

## Core Benefits

**Unparalleled Convenience:** Coffee packs with filters offer ultimate convenience, allowing users to brew a fresh cup of coffee in minutes with minimal effort. simply place the pack in a mug, pour hot water, and steep for the recommended time.

This eliminates the need for measuring coffee grounds, cleaning brewing equipment, and dealing with messy coffee residue. This makes coffee packs ideal for busy mornings, travel, and situations where convenience is paramount.

**Portability and Travel-Friendliness:** The compact and lightweight design of coffee packs makes them highly portable and perfect for travel. They can easily be packed in a suitcase, backpack, or carry-on bag, allowing users to enjoy quality coffee wherever they go.

This is notably beneficial for camping, hiking, hotel stays, or any situation where access to traditional coffee brewing equipment is limited. Coffee packs ensure that a delicious cup of coffee is always within reach.**Consistent Brew Quality:** Pre-portioned coffee grounds and controlled filter design guarantee a consistent brew quality with every cup. This eliminates the guesswork and variability associated with traditional brewing methods.

This consistency is especially important for users who value predictable results and want to enjoy the same great-tasting coffee every time. Coffee packs provide a reliable and repeatable coffee brewing experience.

**Reduced Waste and Easy Cleanup:** Coffee packs minimize waste compared to traditional brewing methods, as there are no loose coffee grounds to dispose of. The used filter bag can simply be discarded or composted, making cleanup quick and easy.

This reduces the environmental impact and simplifies the coffee brewing process. Coffee packs are a convenient and eco-friendly option for coffee lovers.

## FAQs Section

**Are Coffee Packs with Filter as Good as Freshly Ground Coffee?**
While coffee packs offer convenience, freshly ground coffee generally provides a more vibrant and nuanced flavor profile.However,high-quality coffee packs use freshly roasted beans and nitrogen-flushed packaging to preserve freshness,resulting in a satisfying cup that approximates the taste of freshly brewed coffee. the difference is frequently enough subtle, making coffee packs a worthwhile trade-off for the added convenience.

**How Long Should I Steep My Coffee Pack for Optimal Results?**
The recommended steep time varies depending on the coffee pack and the desired strength. Generally,steeping for 3-5 minutes is recommended. Experiment with different steep times to find your preferred flavor intensity. Longer steeping times may result in a stronger and more bitter cup,while shorter times may produce a weaker brew.

**Can I Reuse a Coffee Pack with Filter?**
No, coffee packs with filters are designed for single use only. Reusing a coffee pack will result in a considerably weaker and less flavorful cup of coffee. The coffee grounds will have already been extracted during the first brew, and the filter may be compromised.

**Are Coffee Packs Environmentally Friendly?**
The environmental friendliness of coffee packs varies depending on the materials used. look for packs made with biodegradable or compostable filter bags and packaging to minimize environmental impact. some companies also offer recycling programs for their coffee packs. Always check the product details for specific information on sustainability.

RoBowling Clona- RoBowling had a bowling  shirt for sale in the ball shop. I went and found some bowling pants to go with it. (The pants have a sash with some Asian letters on it for some reason.)

The Lanes Clona- The Lanes is another bowling game with a different shirt. There was a two tone version, as well as a blue and purple version. Found some black bowling pants for this one.

E Girl Clona- Now now before you go all crazy, let me explain. In the game ""The Normal Elevator"" one of the possible floors is the E Girl Factory, in which you have cute outfits like those. There probably are some variants I could make too, if I can find them.

Boba Cafe Clona- There's a little game called Boba Cafe where you can buy coffee and mocha drinks and stuff like that. This is a barista outfit for that game.

Let me know of any other games that have special clothing for sale in them! I know Hole in the Wall does, but there's a LOT of them, so I'd need to get more robux before I get them all.

1mhyfnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mhyfnk/has_anyone_heard_of_a_town_called_doveland/,Has anyone heard of a town called Doveland?,"
So, something strange happened to me today and I wonder if anyone can shed some light on what I found. I drive a lot for work, small trucks delivering stuff between warehouses owned by my company but for the most part, I only drive within Ohio and occasionally over the state line to one of our branches in PA. But for the past week I’ve been driving cross country, how did this start? Well my boss I’ll call him B asked me if I would be willing to fly to New York and pick up a truck there and drive it to Seattle.


As weird as that probably sounds, B is a good guy, and a great boss so I agreed. I know him well enough to know it’s nothing illegal and he was offering to pay me double, plus expenses for every day I was on the road. I figured it would take around a week at most, plus he offered to give me the next week off so I gladly agreed. 



I got into NY around midnight and some guy met me with the truck I was to drive at the airport. I drove it to Philadelphia, called B to let him know how far I’d gotten, and then crashed at a cheap motel. Other than the innate oddness of the request nothing strange happened that night or for the next few after, until I reached Wisconsin. 



Has anyone ever heard of a town called Doveland? I just passed through, and I don’t think it was real. 


It was getting late and I was looking for a place to turn in for the night when I saw the turnoff sign for Doveland, the sign said there was a motel in town so I decided I had gone far enough and would try and get some sleep, but when I entered town it was… well it was strange is the only way I can really think to describe it.


I want you to do a little experiment for me, go on one of those AI image generators and give it a prompt like “generic small town american main street” see what it spits out? That is what this Doveland place was like. What I mean is that everything looked right at a distance but it gave off a really strange vibe, and when I got closer all the small details made no sense. For example, buildings would change material or architectural style seemingly at random, some of the doors had no handles, others too many, or in the wrong place, and weirdest of all, the signs were all nonsense. 


One building had a marquee like an old movie theater that said “Drug Storee”, weird spelling of Store aside that wasn’t that strange but as I got closer I saw smaller text underneath it that was unreadable, just jumbles of letters and numbers that vaguely resembled prices at a distance, same goes for everything in town. The gas station’s sign said “Gaz: 000 por leet” Or at least that’s what it looked like, all the letters were misshapen and oddly drawn, like the font they used was designed by an illiterate.



I tried to call B and let him know I was stopping for the night then, but instead of ringing or a “no signal” tone, I got elevator music like I was on hold. I tried again and the same thing happened, just bad jazz music. Out of curiosity, I tried a couple more numbers like my girlfriend and the pizza place near where I live, but nothing. Or rather, the same thing, just that music again. 



Things only got stranger as I drove through town, no people were out, I mean nobody! I didn’t see a single human being in town. And the few parked cars I passed were all old boxy sedans, they looked 80s vintage, but none of them had any badges or logos that I could see, and all the plates were blank white with black numbers, not real state plates. The numbers were weird too, just sequential digits in the same bizarre font, everyone I passed going higher. 01, 02, 03 like that. 



I never found the motel, I just kept driving until I got out of town then found my way back onto the interstate and kept going until I reached the next town. Some little place called Cottage where I am now. They had a little all-night diner and I’m sitting at a booth there writing this now, thing is when I asked the locals if they could tell me anything about Doveland the waitress nearly spilled a pot of coffee and several old timers gave me really strange looks, then they all started talking over each other assuring me that no such place existed. 
 

They know something, and I don’t think I’m welcome here anymore.

I guess I’m posting here tonight because it’s been a while since someone has been a part of my life. 3 years is long enough I feel, but also not wanting to rush into anything. 

Spent the last 2-3 years doing some needed healing and mentally decompressing, so I kindly ask that if you have healing to do please don’t get involved with me. 

A little about me:

Tall, tattooed and bearded ; full time job , night shifter. Coffee addict, professional couch potato. Italian food , and German food are best. 

Pretty quiet at times, but I do have some extrovert in me. Upon waking up I prefer not to have long conversations until I’ve had coffee and time to process being awake. 

My hobbies range from being outside , to napping , to watching hockey / football , to cooking , to riding a sxs. Music is a must , along with comedy shows and some crime shows. 


The things I look for in a relationship are very simple and mandatory : 

* healthy communication 
* trust
* Honesty 
* accountability 
* not being lazy 
* transparency on goals and expectations 
* intimacy , both in and out of bed

Probably one of the lowest maintenance people you’ll meet ; don’t lie, or cheat, or withhold information from me and we will be fine.  I have to be able to trust you 100%, or it won’t last. 

Do I have a type? Sort of, but that doesn’t mean that’s strictly what I go for. It goes as follows :

* somewhere between 4’11 - 5’6
* short to long dark hair, but red and blonde are fine too 
* tattoos , piercings , glasses 
* silly , caring , motivating , comforting 
* Hypersexual ( since that’s where my drive is ) 

There’s more to discuss, but I feel this is a good starting point. I have pics , and will share them upon messaging. 

Hope to hear from you

For context I'm 33m  and graduated from college in spring 2017.

One person on particular who I remember was a part of our group of friends from sophomore yr to about maybe junior year bc she didn't finish her degree at our university and I think she finished via community college. Well this girl at first we just thought was a pothead who had interesting conversations then as time went on it became noticeable how much of a parasite she was. 

She would always come hangout to get high with us, ask to borrow money (typically like a dollar or two), and sometimes even trade things for weed like coffee she'd get from her part-time barista job. I think she did oxy quite a bit too bc there were a few times she'd say it out loud. 

Anyway, she would say a lot of fucked up shit out loud, talk shit on others, get pissed if you said something to her that was just a joke or comeback, and overall just get irritated with just random interactions in our friend group. For example once she was nodding off in a commons area of our dormitory and she just got pissed at our friend who scared her. Another time at a friend's place not too far from campus I jokingly said to make me a sammich and she just said fuck you and some other things. 

It got to the point that some of our friends quit hanging around with her bc she would just be bumming drugs off us. There was one instant where we hadn't seen or heard from her from sometime and then two of our friends bumped into her in the downtown area of our city (she was attending community college at this point). Before she could say anything like oh hey how's it's going one of our buddies just say, I don't have any weed instantly. 

We had a laugh about it later bc of how it happened so fast. Anyway fast-forward maybe a year, she's still the same, dating some fuck boy still attended our university, and working part-time jobs while in community college. My sister just so happened to work with her at the same part time job but she didn't know we were related. 

One day my sister told me something personal about her family that she had said her at work (not in confidence, she just said it out loud to her and her fellow coworkers). Anyway to not go into too much detail, it was one those apple doesn't fall too far from the tree things. I told this to our friends and we laughed so hard. 

I would go later on to post the story on a social media app at the time, I think it was yik yak back when it was at its peak. I didn't mention names and just kept it vague. Anyway I tell one of our mutual friends he tells her and I'm made out to be the bad guy. And I just laugh bc she would always talk so much shit on others and say see some horrendous things in general, she could dish it out but couldn't take it.

Anyway nothing ever came of it and I think one of her friends tried telling me some shit once shortly after but I just told her to fuck off. 

im no saint by any means but I don't deal with bs from others who are clearly hypocrites, I just wanted to get that off my chest and will probs post more from my college days. ",1,1754363741.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

All of your setups are impressive, and I'd like to add more to mine!

I usually drink 3 or 4 double shots a day. I'll have to add some photos of my ""cortado"" to be judged. 

I started with a walmart single serve deal, with the mini pot that it brewed into. It took a lot to get something that was ""good"" coming from someone who never made espresso. I would grind the beans fresh and only use purified drinking water.

Now I have this Mirox brand machine. It's a significant upgrade, and it makes something that I'd be comfortable calling an espresso. I set the grind to 8, on a scale of 1 to 14 or 16, I can't recall off hand. I assume that's also relative to the machine. Got this cool kit off of Amazon that includes the stabby needle thing to break up chunks, a tamp, and a brush. It came with more, but I really only use these items.

I live in Phoenix, so my favorite spot to get beans is from ""Press Coffee"". They import their beans, and have a roastery in Scottsdale. I also like that they stamp the roast date on the bag. I've been using their Sumatran recently.

I usually make my version of a ""cortado"" like this:

* 2 shot from machine (2.5oz liquid volume)
* 1oz of extra extra Dunkin brand cream (since its cream and not palm oil) steamed to be like 3oz, but I add probably 2oz or so

I'll make a latte like this:

* 2 shot from machine (2.5oz liquid volume)
* 1 ice cube
* 2oz extra extra Dunkin sweet cream
* 4oz milk

1mhy79n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mhy79n/made_a_decisionmistake_that_became_exaggerated/,Made A Decision/Mistake That Became Exaggerated,"I (M25) was broken up with by my (F24) girlfriend about 7 weeks ago. We had been dating for 3 years and had a very supportive loving relationship. We were best friends and even while having to do some long distance while I was at school, were super communicative and supportive every day. Type of relationship where we just knew we wanted to be married one day and it was easy loving each other. We also lived together for a year when I was at school just so she could be with me.

Anyways, I could get caught up in talking about how good it was but I ruined it. We had planned a 4 month trip over seas to celebrate being done long distance and my graduation. 2 weeks before we leave she randomly gets some message from a girl claiming I cheated on her (kissing other girls at a party) 2.5 years ago. I had no idea who this person was but turns out she was at this party that was hosted by my team. This was also hosted at my house I had a bunch of roomates. Everyone knew I was happily and proudly in my relationship. I did everything to try and bring light to this, from calling all my teammates asking for any details on that night or anything that could clear this up. She had no real proof other than she was there that night and from the information I gathered she was actually kicked out of the party for fighting with the girlfriends of my teammates. This was still traumatic for my partner and I tried to be there every moment for her to calmly talk through it with her, making sure I never invalidated her feelings. I was never able to bring true light to this situation other than just like my teammates sticking up for me and saying that if I was doing something like that they would have smacked me or told me the next morning. They all knew her and how much I loved her. We did not just brush this under the rug but we were also to come to some realization of how odd this was and the initial honest responses from my teammates to this all showed their disbelief and confidence that I never acted like that.

That wasn’t the part where I ruined it, this is. About a week later I was finally home and packing up to leave for our trip when I got a phone call from a number I didn’t recognize, I answered it and it was the one ex I had from 5 years ago. I kinda hate this person they were toxic and I was at my worst when I was with them. I used to have insane anxiety and would throw up when I’d see her when we were breaking up. I built myself back up after and knew it was for the best and it was, I found the love of my life years later when I was in a great place. Quickly on the phone she starts talking about how happy she is to hear about my success in my sport and at school and this and that. Then she goes I know you have a girlfriend and I have a boyfriend but I’m driving by (she lives far away) and would love to have coffee quickly and hear about your successes. Super odd and then just like that I made a decision rooted in ego and insecurity that I wouldn’t mind her to see how well and healthy I am now, I don’t have any desire or lust for this person. We had coffee right after and about 10 mins in I mention my girlfriend and then all of a sudden I feel what the fuck am I even doing here. I got up in a sort of panic, told her I needed to leave and this was a mistake and to please not contact me ever again. I was literally leaving on for the trip of a lifetime in the next week with the love of my life and I just decided to prove something to someone who means nothing to me. 

I then made this all worse by just wanting to pretend that 15 mins never happened. We literally were still going through some rebuilding after being falsely accused why the fuck would I put our relationship in danger for real this time. We were leaving for our trip so soon I was selfish and scared to tell her, thinking I could just take my love for her to another level and never ever put myself in a position to hurt her again in our lives. So I didn’t tell her.. then we’re having the time of our lives and she gets a follow request from this ex and then it goes away 1 minute later (5 weeks in). She asks me why she would do that and I lied and said I’m not sure. Then the next morning she gets a message from this person saying I cheated. Instantly my girlfriend gets feelings of ptsd from before, thinks I slept with her, and books a flight home the next day. I tried to tell her we went for coffee and nothing more but I put myself in a position not to be believed and lost her just like that. I drove her to the airport, we said we loved eachother and she said she hopes we can be together in another lifetime because I was supposed to be her forever.

So fucking crushed she was such a good girl and didn’t deserve any of that. Our relationship was deep we were fully intertwined in each others lives and families, she told everyone I was the one for her and the same with me. Once she was home she initiated no contact and the only way I can love her now is by respecting that and not causing her anymore anxiety. I am definitely struggling with the way this was twisted to her thinking I acted the ultimate betrayal. I also came home too and of course knowing she has been telling everyone I fucked my ex and she has been on a full on summer performance of being single. She called me once to cry and tell me she hasn’t been handling this right by partying and numbing (not like her at all). I also knew she had made out with some guy at a concert but honestly, I just love her so much and am so ashamed of how I hurt her that I would never be mad at her. I consoled her when she cried to me, I tried to tell her my truth again, but she just blew this up so much when she got home and I understand, she’s acting in serious pain. Also to mention I tried to call this ex to ask her to please at least clarify we went for coffee and she said no, then began to cry and tell me she has had feelings for me ever since and thought there could be a world where we’d be back together. Disgusted.  

Now I created a messed up reality for myself, by erasing every moment of loyalty and deep love I had for her in exchange for coffee and an ego fuelled decision to try and show off to someone that was my darkness, even when I was safe and happy with my light. I have taken this so seriously maybe almost too much. I see counselling every week but I obsess over how I hurt her I am wired to love deeply and she was the one for me. I obsess over the fact she doesn’t know the truth and it is spread around everywhere. I am not on social media and I know that everyone that knows us is watching her perform and probably believes the same story as she does. I live my truth everyday because that is all I can do and I am growing into the exact man I was supposed to be but with self control and loyalty as my staple. Thanks for reading.

Y’all. Y’ALL. Libraries here are insane. I went to three of them today (my city, my county, and Denver) and had to pick my jaw up off the floor each time. Why isn’t this talked about more?? When you submit a change of address upon moving to Denver, why don’t you get an email or a little flyer in your mailbox that says, “Welcome to Denver! Please visit the local libraries - they’re better than the ones you’re used to, we promise!”


Each library I went to was staffed by the most helpful people who seemed genuinely pleased to help me get a library card, discuss events and classes, and talk about library-related apps. I’ve heard about Libby and Hoopla for years but Alabama libraries don’t support them, so cut to me standing at the information desk finally joining the 21st century. Kindle Unlimited only gets you so far 😂


Also, the checkout amounts and lengths are completely nuts in the best way. Each library I went to had checkout limits of 60-100 books, and each book auto-renews 3 times unless there’s a hold on it. My city’s library basically told me that unless there’s a hold on the book I’ve checked out, I can hang onto it for a year before they get antsy about it. WHAT???


Finally, y’all’s libraries have a lot of cool extras. Coffee shops, book clubs, free movies, sewing/knitting/mending/painting/crafting events, and event and attraction passes to parks, museums, etc. And used book stores inside the libraries! For dirt cheap! I came home with probably 30 books today and spent less than $100 total.


Anyway, I’m jealous of all of y’all who grew up with all of this stuff being the norm. Please tell me y’all take full advantage of the resources you have available to you. And please tell me if there are any libraries around here with special or unique attributes!",3,1754363368.0,DenverBooks,0,1.0,False

- Simple to use (for her; her go-to is flavored pre-ground DD or Starbucks)
- High quality brew (for me; at least comparable to what I get from a Clever Dripper)
- Volumetric brew so we’re not refilling every time
- Timer for overnight prep
- Good for single serve straight into coffee mug or tumbler. 

I’ve read enough to know it makes good coffee. But is it also friendly to someone who just wants to dump in the grinds and push a couple buttons?  I know I could check most the boxes with a cheaper machine, but I’d like to use it as well, and don’t want 2 machines. 

Also considered the new Breville, but think the “brew till the water tank is empty” kills it for me.

After losing half our senior staff, I assigned the position of Chief Conn Officer to an actual con, because he's the best pilot we could have, plus all the other criminals onboard hate his guts and he's clearly the Maquis commander's ex-boyfriend, and tbh I need *some* entertainment out here. 

Anyway, convict-pilot drove a little over the speed limit and began ""evolving"" into an amphibian as a result. Then he kidnapped me for a joyride that turned us both into giant, genetically superior salamanders. We went to a swamp, fucked, and made three salamander babies. 

Luckily it turns out being turned into a salamander is like being turned into a newt; you get better. Unless you're born that way. After talking it over, we decided to leave our three mutant bastard children alone in a swamp planet and head back towards earth. 

I'm feeling very conflicted about the waste of resources. The hedgehog could've whipped up a nice creole dish out of those lizards. Not to mention the gator-skin handbag and boots I could've had. I was always told I got too big a heart. Anyway I gotta go annihilate Tuvix and drink some more coffee.

I spent some time axing it, and then within a few minutes of knife work I noticed the end bowl starting to check (the bowl side was from the interior of the branch not the exterior). I carved away the cracked part and started hollowing out the bowl, thinking that taking away material would relieve some of the tension, but it just kept cracking in new places. Surprisingly it was splitting in the part that was furthest from the pith. I tried dampening it to see if that would prevent more cracks but no luck. This has happened to me with plum wood once before. Is it due to it drying too fast, or just tension in the branch being relieved? It's pretty straight-grained and knot free, though when I split it the split was showing slight twist.

Do I need to let the logs dry out more first before carving? Should I carve it in shorter sessions and keep it damp in the meantime? Any solutions welcome, it's absolutely gorgeous two-toned wood that I only have a limited supply of, so I want to not let it go to waste if possible.",1,1754362933.0,Spooncarving,0,1.0,False

I recently bought an ECM Classika and have been using it for a few weeks now. Thus far, I have been using water filtered through my fridge into a BWT pitcher with a magnesium filter in it. The TDS out of the pitcher is around 60ppm. Recently I became aware of https://www.baristahustle.com/app-archive-main/the-water-calculator/ and just was able to test everything. My pH is super low from the strips I’m using to test, around 6.0 maybe 6.1. With the GH and KH measurements I’m getting, the calculator on barista hustle is saying the water I’m using is -2 LSI and causing corrosion to the machine. 

I also just got a Zero Water tank which is giving me 0 ppm TDS but seems to be even more negative LSI.

My tap water is around 110ppm TDS. 

At this point, is my best option to use Zero Water pitcher and then adding potassium bicarbonate with rpavlis recipe? 

Is there any option available to have water going into the machine that is safe for the machine and won’t cause corrosion/limescale but also has the proper minerals in it for good tasting coffee too? Something like third wave sticks?

At this point if I’ve pulled about 15 shots and done some regular back flushing with the machine with the BWT water, has that already caused much damage to the machine? And until I get potassium bicarbonate or third wave or whatever ends up being my best option, am I better off using the zero water without adding anything else or going with the water from the BWT pitcher? I also noticed there seem to be some small black specks in the tank from the BWT pitcher.

You were incredibly smart, witty—legitimately intelligent. I hadn’t had or spent much time looking for you in life but you were basically perfection. Introspective, aware, wanting what’s best but a bit at odds with yourself. Precious inside and out. 

We met again and spent hours together. You were honest. I could tell you were looking for loyalty and trust. We both were. At the time I just couldn’t see it for myself. I was losing my mind slowly still, I think you could sense it. You asked me about my life and I didn’t know how to respond as my reality was splitting in two and the timeline of my life was getting blurry. Maybe I said one too many things.

# Garden

*Stamos’ villa is an old-fashioned building surrounded by a huge garden. The tree-lined driveway that leads to the main entrance is lined with luxury cars, impeccable valets, and dressed up big shots. On each side of the huge front door, there is a sharply-dressed bouncer who checks invites with a digital scanner and welcomes the eminent guests. A red carpet is rolled out between you and the main entrance, press and photographers line the walkway clamouring for the attention of various guests.* 

* **Guards**
   * *Security is tight and on alert, The well manicured Garden crawling with guards roaming around periodically pausing to speak into their ear pieces*
* **Carmen Rosales (Anchor Voice)** \- News Anchor: *Short and thin, red hair in a chic pixie cut, She wears a conservative blue dress covered with a matching blazer. She is holding a microphone and is placed in front of a large camera.* 
   * **Carmen Rosales:** Good evening, I’m **Carmen Rosales**, reporting live from the private gala of Greece’s greatest living humanitarian, Konstantin Stamos. Celebrated philanthropist, global visionary, and tireless patron of science. Rumor has it, Mr. Stamos has some sort of BIG announcement planned… Tonight! A better future may be just hours away and once again, it begins right here, with the handsome… alluring… 
* *The broadcast is interrupted but some scuffle*
   * **Carmen Rosales (Through her teeth):** Cut the cameras!
   * **Maria** ***\[A short round older woman cries out as she is escorted off by security\]*** **(Older, Frantic)**: No please! I must speak to him! He knows where my boy is! 
      * **\[Critical Action Roll\]** to intervene. Son Gustavo signed up for some sort of clinical trial 8 months ago and has been missing since!
      * The police have been no help!
      * Can have players meet Gustavo later on in Act 3
      * **\[Fail\]** She is dragged around the corner and put into an unmarked car
* **\[Basic Action Roll\]** *You catch a glimpse of a young girl, with long brown hair and big brown eyes wearing a blue dress.* (This is Penelope see Ballroom) 

# Getting in:

* According to my blueprints (bottom of this doc) to the right of the main entrance is a staff entrance and car park. *This place is bustling with activity. Security, Catering, Kitchen staff are rushing in and out of that door*. Not guarded per se but you may be questioned if you don't look and act the part, luckily there are lots of vans, hedges and dark corners to lure people in for an outfit change.
* I have the sewers option lead into the Cellar on this document.  
* For the infiltration mechanics refer to Act 2: Scene 3 (8-10). My players had tickets both times so I ignored the book as there were plenty of things that could go wrong later on :)

# Rooms (Downstairs)

# Ball Room: 

*Then the party begins in earnest and, while a string quartet plays an incredibly sweet melody, hundreds of wealthy men and women crowd around the big white tables illuminated by huge crystal chandeliers. The drinks are flowing chatter and laughter fill the air*

* Guards
   * *Guards are a constant presence, lurking in every corner, tense and alert. Both stairways are flanked by two guards each, dressed in a unique uniform denoting a higher station. There is a guard posted at the last door on the right* (Library) *checking guests against a list before letting them enter.* 
* *A woman passes with a tray of champagne.* (Keep note of who drinks, I have it so wine and champagne are laced with the Project Medusa Virus. This will have consequences you will have to adlib later down the track so proceeded with caution. More info in Cellar)
* A loud crash draws your attention, 
   * **Anastasia Velis**: *Tall and willowy woman with long flowing brown hair. Her sharp eyes and overfilled lips are twisted into a scowl* 
      * **Anastasia Velis (Breathy snooty naisally)**: Hour dare you! Do you know how much this dress cost? 
   * *A young female waiter is on her hands and knees trying to scoop up the broken shards of champagne flutes. The tray rolls towards your feet* ***\[Less engaged Hero\]***.
* *The music stops for a moment then a slow melodic waltz begins to play. Women gasp and giggle grabbing onto their partners and dragging them to the center of the room.*
* **Carmen Rosales (Can't shake the announcer voice)**\- Loud, tipsy, and gossip-prone a perfect info source. *By now the conservative blue blazer is long gone and it seems her crew did not get an invite.* 
   * Knows she is a puppet and doesn't care. It's all about the fame and money baby!
   * I gave her a Southern accent and she proudly states she is from the 5th biggest news station in all of Texas. 
* A ex lover of one of our **\[Less Engaged Heroes\]** appears
* *A small blonde boy maybe 12* (Timothy Van Palton the third) *is pulling the hair of a small brown haired girl with big brown eyes* (Penelope). *She escapes his grip and slips expertly under a nearby table*. 
   * She can tell your players about hidden passages for a price!
      * Price 1: The Jar of lollies guarded by Head Chef – **Eleni Karahalios** in the kitchen. Her feather forbade her from having sweets and the stuff at the gala is all that boring bitter grown up dark chocolate stuff. 
      * Price 2: Revenge on Timothy the boy who always bullies her at these things
   * She is the secret illegitimate daughter of STAMOS, but don't give this info right away.
   * Her bedroom is guest 1.
   * You can find her crayon drawings on the underside of tables and inside the secret passages. Among the typical childlike drawings you can discern a sense of loneliness and isolation. 
   * She is scared of the Celler, it's spooky down there :(
   * If a Player knows Sita she will recognise them from a photo the nice science lady keeps hidden and has shown her.

# Kitchen

*You enter the bustling commercial kitchen, with gleaming state of the art appliances and the scent of delicious food that makes your mouth water. Food that doesn't hold a candle to your cheap hotel continental breakfast. Its Chaos, Chefs are barking orders, staff are hustling and rushing to put out orders.* 

* Head Chef - **Eleni Karahalios**: Late 50s, stern and no-nonsense, with burn-scarred hands and the constant scent of oregano and cigarette smoke. She commands her kitchen like a battlefield.
   * Has a soft spot for Penelope but is under strict orders not to let her get to the lolly jar.
   * The secret ingredient in her cooking is love. 
* Head waiter - **Gustav Elemento**: (haughty French) Tall thin late 40s, dark hair with a receding hairline and thin pointed moustache. 

# Security (Locked)

*In what seems to be some sort of fancy entertaining space a haphazard security room has been set up. Thick monitors stacked precariously on top one another with cables going every which way. A guard sits in front of the fuzzy black and white security feed playing something on his Game Boy. Three off duty guards sit and play cards around a table.* 

* Head of Security - **Markos Theodorou:** Bald, tan ex-military in his 40s, lean and composed with a crooked nose and eyes that miss nothing. 
* Can be circumvented by the secret passage. There is a latch you can open in the secret passage that allows you to see into this room. You see though the eyes or a portrait. 

# Drawing (Locked)

*This lavish entertaining space is filled with overstuffed expensive furniture surrounding a grand fireplace. Hunting trophies of endangered animals line the walls. Chairs are lined up in front of a projector screen. In the middle of the room tied to a chair is a man broken and bloodied*

* This is the side room mentioned in the book stamps goes to after his speech, there are 3 options:
   * This is where security would take you if you are captured
   * If a player was away last session and you need to get them back in the story they can be found captured here
   * Or you find a NPC Spy - **Lysandros Petralis:** Mid-30s, bloodied, bruised, one eye nearly swollen shut. Still manages a smirk through the pain. His hands are tied behind his back, but he radiates defiance.

# Cloak

*It's a cloak room, nothing to see here.*

* A benevolent Director would let a player find an appropriate guest outfit here. While me, a certified asshole would argue you would only find coats and bags. But hey you find One $ of cash for your troubles.

# Gallery (Locked)

You enter a large gallery or what used to be a gallery. It currently seems to be some sort of makeshift storage space. Dust cloths lay over various crates and boxes.

* Idk obligatory gag is that the real **\[insert famous painting\]**?
* I see this as a place STAMOS is storing all his post I control the world now propaganda 
   * Stamos Bobble Heads
   * MESA Make The World Safe Again (Sorry im not that clever)
   * Banners, Propaganda posters e.t.c

# Bathrooms

*They are bathrooms*

* Someone throwing up in the toilet maybe
* Maybe overhear some gossip
* Probably some white powder on the sinks

# Library (Guarded)

*A burly looking guard is posted at the furthest door from the entrance on the right. In the doorway is a velvet rope blocking your path.* 

*Before you is a large personal library, Leather bound tomes line the walls floor the ceiling with comfy nooks a plenty. The air is heavy with smoke here as the richest of the rich gather around blackjack and roulette tables smoking cigarettes and greasing palms*

* Suspicious looking waiters coming up from the cellar with trays of wine and champagne (see cellar)
* Black jack
   * You can win info or a favour here
   * **Russian Mobster** Loses It and accuses another at the table of cheating and pulls a hidden knife. Security leaps into action and escorts them out.
      * **(3) Théo D'Arcy:** Fawning over Stamos, openly flirts with players, secretly fencing stolen artifacts.
      * **(4) Captain Dinos Kouris:** Toasts Stamos constantly. Will recognize anyone he’s seen on wanted posters
      * **(5) Mr. Fox:** Notices the Heroes sneaking around and wants to play both sides
   * I made a simple gambling mechanic, The number next to each name above represents their dice pool. The player rolls the skill they wish to use and you roll for each of the NPCs. Each round player with the least amount of successes is eliminated. Spotlights and Adrenaline are encouraged. 
   * What are they gambling? Cash? Info? Help? Maybe an NPC needs a favour? Like stealing and destroying a ledger from STAMOS’s office. 
* Ex-Spy - **Irini Galanis**. Early 40s, sharp features and eyes that always scan the room like she’s measuring exits. She once worked for an agency, now she works for the highest bidder in this case, Stamos.



# Celler (Hidden)

*The temperature drops as you descend down the cramped staircase. It is cool, dark and dank. There are shelves and shelves of wine of the most expensive vintages. In the middle of the room on a table is a makeshift bottling operation. Freshly sealed bottles of the white and red wines and the champagne you saw circulating upstairs sit in crates by the table.* 

* (I have it so wine and champagne are laced with the Project Medusa Virus. This will have consequences you will have to adlib later down the track so proceed with caution.)
* **\[Basic Action Roll\]** You know these vintages, they are not of Greek origin and certainly not bottled in this room. 

* **\[Critical Action Roll\]** You are familiar with this sort of operation, but that bottle and dropper ore out of place are not like anything you have seen before.
   * In my game players who drunk any of the circulating drinks have been infected with Project Medusa
* Many books about folklore, cryptids and occult shit on desk
   * **\[Locked Drawer**\] (Urdu) Indian folklore and the creatures that lie within (one page is town out)
* You enter here if your players took the sewers

# Information:

The following is a list of information that can be gleaned from guests

* **\[Basic Action Roll\]:**
   * Everyone considers Stamos a philanthropists (emphasise this and with all the guests gushing about him)
   * Whispers of a new announcement from his research lab
   * Kind of popped up out of nowhere
* **\[Critical Action roll\]**
   * They found something in one of his digs
   * Trouble in one of his labs, a hasty relocation.
   * Secretive and very powerful people fund him
   * Stamos controls local law enforcement, and the top brass of the police are on his payroll as well as the media. 
   * Climbed quickly in the ranks during Balkan military operations
      * Whispers of War crimes
   * Doctor Sita Khan is still alive and currently at Stamos’ party. 
   * He has purchased an abandoned marble quarry and is and has dropped a lot of money building something but everyone involved is sworn to secrecy. You can’t even get close.
* **Progress the story \[Critical Action Roll\]**  Stamos’ study is located on the top floor of the villa, where no guest is ever allowed to go*.* All doors are blocked by agents of Stamos’ SECURITY TEAM. The only way to get there without arousing suspicion, is to create a diversion.

# Rooms (Upstairs) [Guarded]

# Living space

# This room consists of a kitchen and a lounge, a door in the back likely leads to a bathroom. The only sign that anyone lives there is the empty coffee mug on the kitchen counter. 

* If they use secret stairs: *You see STAMOS back towards you staring blankly at a mirror, seemingly transfixed. After a few long moments his whole demeanor shifts back straightening and his mouth twisting into a dazzling smile. A picture of confidence and ease this is the charismatic KONSTANTIN STAMOS you have heard so much about. It is creepy. Before you can react he turns on his heel and is out the door. You hear the distant crown erupt as he appears at the top of the stairs.*
   * **Act 2: Scene 4** plays out per the book but the heroes can see it as the peer over the railing. The boring presentation takes place in the Drawing room. 

# Guest 1

*When you open the door your eyes fall upon a man and a woman sitting on the edge of the bed. They are kissing passionately the mans hand begins to wonder, the womans eyes open and meet yours.*

* \*Sheiks\* GET OUT! She throws her stiletto at **\[Hero\] \[Basic Reaction Roll\]**
* **\[Basic Action Roll\]** The only indication a child is living here is the single old well worn teddy bear on the bedside table

# Guest 2

*The lavish guest bedroom is currently unoccupied, though the bed is unmade. Some women's clothing and belongings lay scattered around (This where Sita Khan has stayed for a few days).*

* **\[Critical Action roll\]** *You notice the corner of a photo poking out from under the mattress. Two grinning teenagers stand side by side, The girl who is taller and slightly older has her arm wrapped around* ***\[The person who knows Sita\].*** 

# Master

*The heavy curtains are drawn tight, it's dark and you are unable to make out much. The room is sparse and devoid of any life or personality. The large bed is made with military precision.* 

# Office: 

* The guards who are posted outside the door are currently leading over the railing watching STAMOS’s Speech. Making it very easy to sneak up on them.
* Refer to Project Medusa Book

I hope this is the right subreddit to post this in.
Im on 10mg fluoxetine (started about 12 days ago) and 40mg vyvanse (started February this year)
I had 3 ish hours of sleep last night so I decided to have some coffee with my breakfast today.
Had caffeine and my medication around noon. It is now 7:37pm.

About an hour ago I started really feeling my heart beat, and my legs started to feel cold. 
I think it’s related to poor circulation though… 
When I was only on vyvanse every time I stood up I’d feel really faint and feel like I was 80% unconscious while trying not to fall. 
That happened to me earlier but really strong. Since then I’ve stayed in bed since even sitting up makes me feel faint.
My hands are also quite sweaty and warm, weird to the contrast of my feet being cold. 
And idk when I started to feel shakey but maybe like 40 minutes or 30 minutes ago.

I mean they’re always cold I have poor circulation I guess.

I just checked my pupils, they look a normal amount of dialated. But I feel more dissociative than normal.

1mhxlyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1mhxlyr/cat_with_pancreatitis/,Cat with pancreatitis,"We've got a senior cat who's about 16-17ish. He recently became incredibly picky with food and started loosing weight and sleeping in weird places. We took him to the vet and they ran some tests and told us he has pancreatitis. We put him on buprenorphine, anti-nausea medication and we do a daily IV for fluid hydration. We've been doing this for 4 days but he doesn't seem to be getting any better. He sits all day uncomfortably on our coffee table and only gets up to eat very little or use the litter box. 

Has anyone had any experience with this? What's the chances of him improving to the point of him having a reasonably decent quality of life? It's very difficult seeing him like this and we don't want to just keep him alive if he's suffering. ",1,1754361881.0,AskVet,2,1.0,False
1mhxiw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1mhxiw4/cardinal_scents_an_update_from_the_crossroads/,Cardinal Scents: an update from the crossroads.,"Hey guys. It's been a rough summer.

I want to give the community my apologies. I really thought I could just white knuckle my way through. I've got this beautiful website that I don't know to operate properly, I think I might be charging taxes wrong, the Canadians are rightfully so upset with us that they keep sending my packages back at the border, my daughter doesn't know how middle school works yet and neither do I, and I think I need to move because it's absurdly expensive for a state that doesn't have women's rights, but does have Nazis and a billion dollar Elon Musk tunnel. 

It's all just....a lot. There's a concept in the fitness world: pump to failure. They say that's how you get strong. Go until you can't physically do it anymore. Fail, and then rest. Both are important. 

I've made some frankly embarrassing mistakes over the past month or two (late shipping, switched entire orders, misread the sizes purchased, sent someone my Kroger card instead of my business card???). I'm going in too many different directions, too fast, and I'm making dumb errors because of it. 

I need to take a minute. I need to breathe. I am going to close down on Sunday and take a break. I'm going to stay open this week to give you guys a chance to stock up on anything that you absolutely need before I take a break. I don't anticipate reopening until October. 

I have a plan for this week. I have enlisted some help to get all my orders pushed out. For anyone reading who has not gotten their order yet, I will be going through my messages and reaching out to each of you tomorrow with an updated time frame. Extras will be offered, so let me know if there's something you're interested in.

For anyone who DID receive AN order, but it was WRONG, please send me an email at [cardinalscents@gmail.com](mailto:cardinalscents@gmail.com) at your earliest convenience, and I will get you sorted out. Please put the word PASSERINE in the subject line so I can make sure I don't miss anyone. 

I will still be taking orders on both Etsy and my website until 5 pm CST on Sunday, August 10. 

I have to be real here: I can't keep flying along by the seat of my pants. I love being a scrappy one woman show, always open, never advertising, just keeping my head down and bottling to order. That got me pretty far. I'm proud of myself, and so grateful to all of you, for that. My confidence and my skill as a perfumer have both grown immensely over this year. This has worked better than I ever dared imagine. The proof of concept is in. How terrifying and wonderful it is, to have built something. 

But here we are at the crossroads, one year later. 

I have done things so far in the way that made sense to me at the beginning. I started this venture against everyone's advice, with a little over $4000 in seed money and a burning desire to prove them wrong. I resupply in small amounts, as needed. I rely on Amazon (i know) for my sample bottles, pipettes, labels, packing material, boxes. I only spend what I make, and I buy the smallest unit needed. That worked out just fine at first. Now it's killing me. It's the difference between buying 250ml of Hedione for $49 vs 1000ml for $95. It's ordering ten different essential building block materials in the smallest size three times in one month because the cash flow isn't there for the bulk purchase. It's spending $25 to buy 50 sample spray bottles when I could get ten thousand of them for five cents each, custom printed with my logo.

This is what the crossroads is asking of me. Do I want this? Do I want to keep doing this for another year, five, twenty? Because if I do, (and I really, really do), that means I have to get serious.

That means LLC, quarterly taxes, spreadsheets, and business credit. That means small business loan applications and financial records. It means a business plan that isn't scrawled across nine crumpled notecards stained with coffee rings and ambroxan. It means a lot of things. 

The chaos of this year has had a clarifying effect. Tennessee is not right for Cardinal. All birds have to fly the nest, and this one belongs up north. That's where I grew up, in the northwest corner of Illinois, right at the edge where the endless corn fields drop away into the bluffs and valleys of the Driftless. I've been down here too long. I dream of blue pines and black loam and northern accents and grass you can walk barefoot on. I want to go home. I want to bring my daughter back home. I can't let her grow up here. I can't let Cardinal, either.

If you've made it to the end, thank you for reading.

This is not goodbye. I'm stepping away so that I can take off my jacket and roll up my sleeves. I have work to do, and I'm here to do it. Thank you for your patience while I move this mountain, pebble by pebble. And I'm really sorry about the Kroger card. You know who you are. ",58,1754361631.0,Indiemakeupandmore,9,0.98,False

I am in no way at all your typical millennial, who jumps around jobs every 4-5 years, I have the old standard “pine box” mentality, because the thought of job hunting again brings up old mental scars and PTSD. To give an example I am writing this having lunch in a food court, fully aware I only have an hour for lunch, but knowing full well (as I have done it in the past and many many times) I have done my errands or come back way!!! Later, with zero repercussions.

I have written in Reddit many times in response to various multiple posts of people seeking “a job where they get paid to do F-All” and I have written claiming I am the king. The tasks associated with my role do not take an entire 8-hour day to fully accomplish, I fill the rest of the time with podcasts, tv shows and a music playlist that runs for 5 hours every, single, day.

The role I have does not require me to have my phone be on official work apps, or networks I use the guest Wi-Fi. I strive at passing phishing attacks because I very rarely ever get emails, I don’t have an inbox or outbox, I feel guilty going to my therapy appointments during my lunch hour, knowing full well there will never be any kind of inquiry when I eventually come back.

I have even gone so far, as to fall asleep at my desk, in an open plan environment, surrounded by other people, or gone to sleep in the first aid room, and never been caught (I also have Crohn’s, so I have that to use as an excuse but so far have never needed to)

My work has given me a lot of accommodations; I treat them as “red flags” due to my original Job statement I got hired on (6 years ago) never stating any of what I do now.

My autism suits this job perfectly (routine, structure, consistency, same shit different day etc) but the things I thought were red are turning green. I feel like I am getting way too comfortable and don’t know if that will come back to bite me.

I work in Facilities, in a pretty well managed building (or there are just some things that will never, never, ever!!!) be fixed, due mainly to departments never having the money, or no one caring, or the task in question is way too labour intensive, it is one of those jobs that is impossible to come up with an ""elevator pitch"" because I am always operating behind the scenes.

My job doesn't require having a degree in electrical or plumbing work, or any qualifications like that, we are called in to assess a complaint, and when we reach our own mandated walls ((the things we can do and the things we can't do, or knowing when to cross the line (line = who is responsible for this ""job"") or the things we will die if attempting to fix ourselves)) we then have a rolodex of contacts of people that will then come and fix the problem (it's that old meme, of the repair company who's slogan was ""we fix the things your husband fixed"") My ""team"" also treats me like Batman (Batman = you only call when Gotham is on fire, every fireman and police officer is dead, all villains have escaped Arkham and Joker is the Mayor) then call me in and the task/s (whatever it is) will be done, ""in case of emergency, break glass, put up the sign, call me""

I refer to myself as an Office Aesthetics Manager, and my job/daily tasks rely heavily on idiots, those without a sense of or knowledge of, or remit of common sense, because if they suddenly did, I would be made redundant in seconds. I would come into work, and chairs would be pushed in, in every meeting room, the whiteboards would be cleaned, trash would be properly sorted, no coffee cups left, no whiteboard markers left on the floor etc. My fear comes from hoping one day, my work doesn't realise they can get a monkey to do my job and pay it far less than what I make.

Out of an 8-hour day, I work maybe an hour and a half or 2, the rest of the time I am watching full tv shows/movies/wwe events, listening to podcasts/audiobooks etc, as well as recently listening to a playlist I created myself reflecting the horrors of the world and my own situation in life, I refer to it is (drinking poison and hoping the person you hate dies) as of writing it currently goes for 6hrs and 19 minutes, and is 111 songs (helps to listen in order and link has been provided)

[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ONMnFatqO7FwcVYGNnvgr?si=xQrc2OSNRsKXv4TTMBKV5Q&pi=GNDbJg8TRDmOc](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ONMnFatqO7FwcVYGNnvgr?si=xQrc2OSNRsKXv4TTMBKV5Q&pi=GNDbJg8TRDmOc)

I have asked multiple times for more tasks, but told not to worry, and have asked so many times that I feel like AITA, for asking so often, so I have stopped.

Put it this way, I am not done writing yet, and clearly have all the time in the world to write this, undisturbed and uninterrupted at ""work""

I am part of a team, but I am fully autonomous and fully anonymous, I wear black everyday (it's my uniform) but I am always in the shadows, like a theatre worker, shit gets done, sets get built but work never really acknowledged.  

I spend most of my day expecting to get caught ""Jesus is coming, look busy"" I am constantly paranoid of wasting time, not looking like I'm working (even though I have done all my tasks) (Guess me sitting at my desk, currently writing this looks like to an outsider ""I assume"" that I am ""working"" when I am clearly not)

Feeling like I am walking on tippy toes or eggshells making sure I don't screw up.

I probably would stop complaining/worrying/stressing if my job description actually listed what I do all day (which is essentially F All) If there is someone on here who is complaining or concerned or worried that they claim they are restless or bored or convinced they do nothing all day, if there was an Olympics and they think they are on the podium in first place, I will gladly ""you can't see me"" come out of nowhere RKO them, rip the medal off around their neck and claim ""I am the captain now""

But going back to my question title, sorry for the background ""Rant"" needed the background info.

Just came out of a performance review meeting. Everything is positive, all signs of ""high performance"" meeting targets and all my KPI's achieved. This year I am getting a bonus, increase in pay (and back pay) and everyone is happy with me... Then why am I still sad? I know I do F All all day, every day, but clearly either they do as well and don't care, or me doing F All, isn't as bad as I think it is, if the results speak for themselves.

I get what I said earlier about not getting ""recognition"", but the money helps.

Yeah, it's not CEO FU money, but I know it never will be, and as things around me (daily basic necessities including medical/electrical/phone/utilities bills get higher and higher) it feels like I don't know what I am working for, as the money I get comes into my hands, and slips out like it was sand.

I went home, apparently got wine on the way. I work as a webcam model so got ready to shake tits for strangers. I wake up and have a warning from the site that you can't fall asleep on stream. It's my only source of income I'm so glad I didn't get suspended. 
I got a fucking expensive Airbnb in a new city while I'm looking for an apartment and I wanted to work 24/7 and instead I'm getting fucked up. I had to leave the place I lived before because it was killing me slowly and I thought I'd stop being so self destructive in a new place. Turns out I'm an alcoholic piece of shit wherever I go. I am scared to go back online because I was probably talking shit and I just fucking fell asleep. Idk for how long and how many people saw me. I need money tho.
Also I puked out my guts and had the worst headache ever. What is my life. Chairs ",9,1754361040.0,cripplingalcoholism,1,1.0,False

I’m looking for someone to look for an apartment with. I currently live in Mt Hope. Looking to move into a 2BR/3BR, ideally around this part of town, but am open to other areas like the West Side or Smith Hill. Flexible move in date. 


About me: Early 30s dude, full-time worker in construction, hours are 7-3 usually, often out of the apartment hanging with friends post-work. No pets. Will need parking spaces. Very involved in Providence community groups. Like biking and reading and local music. 


Would prefer to live with someone close to my own age rather than a young college kid, so someone late 20s and up would be great.



Some 2BRs and 3BRs I see on Zillow are $1,500-$1,800, which is my general price range to split between two people. DM me and we can meet for coffee to talk

I’ve been chatting with some people online for awhile, many months. Two of them I have met in real life and we’ve traveled together, and one I have not. We decided to all go on a trip together this past weekend and over all it was an amazing time. They all knew I was trans (M2F) right from the beginning and all of them have been extremely supportive of me. There are two women and one man (all cis) and the man is apart of the LGBTQIA community. 

I went to a coffee shop with the man and while we were waiting for our drink orders he turns to me and totally out of the blue asks, “so what’s your name?” 

I was totally caught off guard, I then became anxious, and then I was scared. I didn’t know what to do and I didn’t know how to respond.

I looked at him, and said, “wait what?” 

And he said, “like what’s your dead name? like I know I’m not supposed to ask but…?”

And I told him. I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know how to deflect. I just panicked and told him. 

I privately told the other two women what happened later that day and they were appalled. They apologized and were so supportive of my feelings. They offered to send him away [from the trip], they offered to leave with me [and go somewhere else]…They would have done anything I asked them. Of course I did not want to be a bother or to cause issues so I just said that I was fine, but I’m not sure if I am fine. I honestly feel that he asked me out of curiosity and without malcontent, but I’m really bothered by what happened. 

Do I cut him out, do I talk to him further about this, do I do nothing? I’m just really confused about this. ",3,1754360796.0,transbutnotshitty,2,1.0,False
1mhx8bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lowpolytutorial/comments/1mhx8bt/the_3_best_iptv_service_providers_i_tested_my/,The 3 Best IPTV Service Providers I Tested: My Personal 4K Streaming Comparison for 2025,"👋 If you’re like me, you’re done with overpriced cable packages, buffering nightmares, and scrolling through 10 apps just to find *one* thing to watch. That’s why I went deep into the **IPTV** rabbit hole—testing 8 top **IPTV service providers**—to find the [**best IPTV subscriptions**](https://iptvgreat.live/) for 2025. I focused on 4K quality, channel variety, VOD libraries, and overall value. No fluff, no bias—just real screen time. Here are my top 3 picks (and why they’ll transform your binge life!).

# Why IPTV? Cut the Cord Without Losing Your Mind

For newbies: **IPTV** (Internet Protocol Television) streams live TV, sports, movies, and shows via the internet. Think Netflix meets live satellite—but cheaper, smarter, and packed with global content. The **best IPTV services** offer insane channel counts, massive Video-on-Demand (VOD) libraries, and 4K streaming without the $200/month bill.

I prioritized:

* **Stability**: No lag during NFL Sundays (non-negotiable).
* **Content**: 40,000+ channels? 100,000+ VOD titles? Yes, please.
* **Value**: Why pay more when you can get *everything* for under $20/month?
* **Ease of Use**: Set-up in minutes, not PhD hours.

Ready? Let’s dive into my top 3 **best IPTV providers** of 2025👇

# 🥇 #1: [**IPTVGREAT**](https://iptvgreat.live/) – The ""Unbeatable Value"" King

\*Starting at $14/month\*

**My Take:** If you want MAX channels for MIN cash, [**IPTVGREAT**](https://iptvgreat.live/) is your holy grail. With **140,000+ channels** and **100,000+ VOD titles**, it’s like having a Netflix/Hulu/PPV/Sportsbook fusion—all for the price of a fancy coffee. I tested this **IPTV service provider** for 3 weeks, and wow—the 4K streams felt like I’d hacked my TV.

**Why You’ll Love It:**

* **Channel Monster**: 140k+ global channels—from ESPN 4K to Bollywood hits, Arabic news, and niche sports (hello, Bulgarian handball!).
* **VOD Library**: 100k+ movies/shows, updated daily. I binged *Oppenheimer* in 4K without a hiccup.
* **Price Smackdown**: At **$14/month**, it’s the cheapest **best IPTV subscription** I tested—yet outperformed pricier rivals.
* **User-Friendly**: Instantly works on Firestick, Android, Smart TVs. No tech headaches!

**Perfect For:** Mega-channel hoarders, sports nuts, and bargain hunters. If you want *everything* without emptying your wallet, [**IPTVGREAT**](https://iptvgreat.live/) is the **best IPTV service** for 2025.

# 🥈 #2: [**IPTVFOLLOW**](https://iptvfollow.com/) – The ""VOD Juggernaut""

\*Starting at $15/month\*

**My Take:** Movie buffs? This one’s for YOU. [**IPTVFOLLOW**](https://iptvfollow.com/) boasts a **1,50,000+ VOD library**—the largest I tested. I felt like a kid in a candy store: new releases, HBO classics, anime, and documentaries in buttery 4K. Plus, 45,000+ live channels? Game over.

**Why You’ll Love It:**

* **VOD Heaven**: 150k+ movies/shows—50% bigger than most **IPTV services**. I watched *Dune 2* in 4K the day it dropped.
* **Live TV Excellence**: 45k+ channels, including 4K sports, PPV events, and international feeds.
* **Price-to-Content Ratio**: Just **$15/month** for this vault? Unreal.
* **Zero Buffering**: Streamed 4 hours straight during peak time—no spinny wheel of doom.

**Perfect For:** Bingers, film fanatics, and families who want endless on-demand options. For the **best IPTV provider** in VOD depth, [**IPTVFOLLOW**](https://iptvfollow.com/) dominates.

# 🥉 #3: [**IPTVTOPS**](https://iptvtops.com/) – The ""All-Rounder MVP""

\*Starting at $15/month\*

**My Take:** Balance is key—and [**IPTVTOPS**](https://iptvtops.com/) nails it. With **40,000+ channels** and **150,000+ VOD titles**, it’s a Swiss Army knife of **IPTV services**. I tested it during a chaotic UFC fight night (10 streams at once!), and it didn’t flinch. Smooth, reliable, and packed with gems.

**Why You’ll Love It:**

* **VOD Powerhouse**: 150k+ movies/shows rivaling [**IPTVFOLLOW**](https://iptvfollow.com/). Found every season of *Stranger Things* in 4K.
* **Live TV Variety**: 40k+ channels, including hard-to-find regional networks and 4K sports.
* **Stability Champion**: Zero drops during 4K streams. Even my Wi-Fi cried—but [**IPTVTOPS**](https://iptvtops.com/) held strong.
* **Affordable**: **$15/month** for this quality? Yes, please.

**Perfect For:** Households with diverse tastes, UFC/boxing fans, and anyone wanting reliability + content depth. It’s the **best IPTV service** for no-compromise streaming.

# How I Tested (My Brutally Honest Method)

I didn’t just *watch*—I stress-tested these **IPTV providers** like my Netflix password depended on it:

1. **4K Or Bust**: Streamed 4K content daily for 2+ hours.
2. **Channel Surfing**: Jumped 100+ channels in 10 mins (no freezing = winner).
3. **VOD Deep Dive**: Searched obscure titles (\*""90s Slovakian rom-coms""\*, anyone?).
4. **Peak Hour Torture**: 7–10 PM streams during NBA playoffs.
5. **Device Test**: Firestick, Android TV, iOS, and Smart TV compatibility.

Spoiler: These 3 **best IPTV services** aced it.

[Verse 1]
It ain’t flowers and wine every night

It’s talkin’ soft when we both got scars

You hold me when I ain’t worth much
And I still show up when it’s tough

We don’t dance like we used to do

1mhx4d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mhx4d2/amalgam_the_long_night/,Amalgam: The Long Night,"The rhythmic thumping of the rain off my windshield was broken by the clacking of my turn signal as my car slowly came to a halt outside of the Burger King whose dim lights shone like a beacon in the night. A sharp scrape echoed through the night as my rusted Nissan turned into the parking lot. Inside I was greeted by an empty restaurant filled only by the sounds of beeps and frying. A young girl stood by the counter, her eyes drooped low as she struggled to stay awake on the overnight shift. ""How can I.. Help youu?'
 
""Picking up an order for Francis.""
 
She turned to the shelf that sat on her left side and grabbed a small plastic bag along with a large cup drenched in condensation. The drink nearly slipped out of her grip as she handed it to me. I sheltered the order with my torso as I quickly shuffled to my car. The condensation of the soda soaked through the front of my shirt while the rain drenched my back. As I ducked into my car the lid of the drink popped and spilled some of its contents onto my center console. I wiped it up with a spare T-shirt I had lying in the back seat but the syrup had already left behind a sticky coating.
 
After a deep breath I updated the GPS and made my way to finish the delivery. The rain picked up, out pacing my old, barely functioning windshield wipers. Combined with the midnight darkness and the town's inability to keep streetlights lit I was effectively driving blind. I could just barely see the yellow lines that divided the lanes, the only guide I had to keep me on the road. A flash of red leaped out in front of my car followed by a loud thump and the slight rise and fall of my car overcoming the sudden obstacle. I immediately swerved right and came to a stop on the side of the road. My heart pounded as I looked into my rear view mirror, the red tail lights of the car just barely illuminated an arm reaching out of the darkness. I grabbed my phone and dialed 911. The impatient voice of an older woman greeted me. ""911.. What's the emergency?""
 
""I-I J-just hit someone… on the road… I didn't mean.. I just couldn't see him."" I whimpered out.
 
""And where are you now?""
 
"" I'm stopped on bay view highway.. A little past the Burger King.""
 
""Mmm-kay… an officer should be there shortly. Can you tell me the condition of the victim?""
 
I looked back into the rear view, the arm still laid motionless in the road. ""I don't know… I don't think he's moving…""
 
""Don't think?"" The operator unenthusiastically replied.
 
""I-I'm still in my car. I can only see his arm at the moment.""
 
""Are you able to get a closer look?""
 
""Y-yea, just give me a sec."" I slowly opened my door and cautiously approached the person in the road. I used the light from my phone to guide my way around the pot holes and puddles. Before me laid a man, just barely breathing. White stuffing leaked out of his shredded red jacket and his face was covered in deep cuts where blood streamed out and got swept away by the rain. One of his eyes hung from its socket and laid on his cheek, the other was gone entirely.
 
""oh god… god god god!""
 
""Sir?""
 
""His eyes! Oh god his eye is just hanging there!""
 
""Sir, is he breathing?""
 
""I think so… his chest looks like it's…"" My sentence was broken by the sudden gasp of the man who desperately tried to speak past the blood pooling in his throat.
 
“HHHEELLLPP M-MEEE…  HEEELLLLPP MMMEE"" I stared at him, frozen. Blood leaked from the corners of his mouth as he made another desperate plea.

“P-PLEASE HHHEEELLPPP MMMEE” Tears began to flow down my cheeks. 

“I’m sorry… I didn’t mean to, I didn’t see you!” His frantic wheezing started to slow, each breath was quieter than the last. He laid his head back on to the asphalt. His chest rose before softly falling only to never rise again. 

“Sir? Hello? Sir? Is he responsive?”

I slowly sank to my feet on the rain soaked road and sobbed into my arms. I could hear the deafening sirens start to make their approach. The next two hours were filled with questioning. Questioning from the officers trying to figure out what happened, questioning from paramedics trying to evaluate my health and questioning from the entitled bastard who wanted his food. The only question I didn’t have an answer for were the cuts on the man’s face. 

The paramedics asked if I saw any wild life around. They said the slashes resembled a mauling, that it might’ve been why he ran into the road so frantically. I told them I didn’t see a thing, that I could barely even see the guy before I hit him and that since he was dead by the time they arrived it would stay a mystery. After the scene was cleared and the police determined I was at no fault and the incident was an honest accident I was allowed to finally return home. 

The rain was just starting to clear up by the time I pulled into my driveway. My neighborhood was empty and silent. The flashes of a tv behind my neighbor’s drawn curtains were the only sign of life to be found. I grabbed the now cold Burger King sitting in my passenger seat and made my way to the front door. As I slammed my car door shut the leaves in a nearby tree rustled violently. I looked over to see one of the smaller branches was now snapped, barely clinging to the tree, the work of an overweight racoon no doubt. After making my way outside I stripped out of my rain soaked clothing and jumped into the shower.

As the steaming water fell my cold skin began to warm. I stood and basked in the hot water absorbing its comfort for as long as I could. As I closed my eyes I saw the haunting visage of the man staring back at me. I saw the desperate expression of his face turn lifeless once again as his solemn pleas echoed in my mind. This waking nightmare was interrupted by the water suddenly running cold.

After drying off I threw on a pair of pajamas and wrapped myself in a blanket before collapsing on the couch. Just as I was about to drift to sleep I heard a sound coming from my back yard. At first it was faint, muffled, but then it rang out once more, and much more clear. 

“HHHEELLLPP M-MEEE”

I shot up and stared at my back door in disbelief, surely I had just begun to dream? 

“HHHEELLLPP M-MEEE” The unmistakable voice of the man begged once more.

“HHHEELLLPP M-MEEE” I slowly made my way to the door. Before opening it I peaked through the blinds on the window, though my view was slightly obscured I saw nothing. I opened the door to get a more concrete look, still nothing just as I’d hoped.

Suddenly the trees rustled followed by something large leaping out of them, flying towards my door. I quickly attempted to slam the door shut but before I could close it fully something large collided into it. The sudden force sent me flying back onto the floor behind the door. I heard a soft cough followed by clacking. Just beyond the edge of the door a creature began to emerge entering my house. It looked like a cat but much larger, too small to be a cougar, maybe a bobcat? But even then its tail was too long and it had another strange feature. There were thin flaps of leathery skin tucked under its front legs almost like the wings of a bat. 

Fortunately it had not noticed me cowering behind the door and instead investigated the couch I had been laying on just moments before. My heart sank as it suddenly turned towards me, but as its face met mine I noticed another peculiar feature. In place of its eyes where stretches of fur covered skin, the creature was blind. Yet it still stared towards my direction as its whiskers twitched. Its mouth opened revealing four heinous fangs before it made the haunting call. 

“HHHEELLLPP M-MEEE” 

I quickly clasped my hands over my mouth using every ounce of will I had to not make a sound. It began to slowly walk closer to me. 

“HHHEELLLPP M-MEEE”

The creature was cautious in its movement, more investigating than stalking but it grew closer all the same. 

“HHHEELLLPP M-” Its call was interrupted by the obnoxious ringing of my phone. Still sitting on the coffee table. Its head quickly turned back to the direction of the phone before it let out a horrendous hiss and pounced towards the origin of the noise. The weight of the beast collapsed the table and it grabbed a hold of the device in its mouth. The pressure of its bite snapped it in half. 

I used the opportunity to slowly rise to my feet. The creature was still preoccupied searching through the rubble of the table. I slowly and carefully took a step pausing before I dared to make another. It still paid no mind. I took another step and still nothing but as I went to take my third I brushed up against the door ever so slightly causing the hinges to creak just a bit. The ears of the cat perked up as it turned its head towards me.

Once again it made its way towards me. It walked over to the spot where I had sat and rubbed its whiskers along the ground and wall. Once again it mimicked the dying man.

“HHHEELLLPP M-MEEE”

My body began to tremble in fear. The creature walked directly in front of me, its whiskers just barely clearing my legs. I could feel the warmth of its body and smell its faint but putrid odor. I clenched my fists by my side and stood as straight as I could. The creature began to wag its tail, swaying it side from side. Each swing came closer and closer to hitting me, I could feel my scream bottle at the base of my throat, fighting to find its way out. But before my presence could be made known there was a knock at the door.

“Eric? *knock knock* It’s Janice Eric. Are you okay? I heard some loud noises and I think I heard screaming? Do you need me to call an ambulance?”

The cat's ears perked up again as its head turned towards my front door before it bolted out the back and leaped up onto the roof. I could hear its pounding steps trail across my ceiling. 

“Eric I’m gonna dial 91-” A loud thump was followed by Janice’s awful shriek. 

“WHAT THE HELL! GET IT OFF ME!!! ERIC! ERIC GET IT OFF ME!!!”

I could hear her body being slammed up against the door, the rattle of the doorknob could barely be heard over her screams. I ran to my closest and grabbed my old college bat. 

“HEELLPP SOMEONE HELL-” her begging was ended with a sharp snap followed by a deep growl. I slowly walked over to my front door. I could hear the beast tearing away at her flesh. I gripped the door knob and slowly turned it until the door drifted open. I preemptively raised the bat above my head before fully opening the door. 

The creature's snout was buried deep in Janice’s back. It raised its head towards me, and just as the monster's blood covered mouth began to snarl I brought the bat down on its head, over and over again until the bat began to splinter in my hand. By the time I was done its head was completely caved in, and its body laid limp over Janice. 

I fell to my knees and began to sob, unleashing every primal noise I had repressed up until this moment. But through my blurred, teary vision I noticed something strange tucked under the fur of the beast's neck. The tan of its body was interrupted by a small blue streak. I moved the fur away to reveal a leash hugging tight against its neck and hanging off of it was a small brass tag that read “Randall”.

The spread is Detroit -1.5 (-161) and Minnesota +1.5 (+135), meaning you’ll need a Tigers win by two runs or more to cash that spread bet. The total is a tight 8 runs, with the Over (-120) projected to score like a kid in a candy store and the Under (+100) promising the entertainment of watching a spreadsheet fall asleep.

The SportsLine model, which has simulated this game 10,000 times (presumably while sipping coffee and muttering about “run distributions”), predicts 9.4 combined runs. That leans hard toward the Over, which is good news for anyone who enjoys offense over a 3-2 scoreline that makes a nap seem exciting.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and the Art of the Rebuild**  
The Tigers are coming off a 2-0 loss to the Phillies, which is about as thrilling as a tax audit. But let’s not forget: They’re still first in the AL Central, eight games ahead of the Guardians, and have won four straight at home. Their offense, led by Riley Greene and Kerry Carpenter, is a well-oiled machine that could power through Casey Mize’s ERA like a Tesla through a tollbooth.

The Twins? They’re 12 games under .500 and in the early stages of a rebuild that’s going about as smoothly as a soufflé in a tornado. They’ve lost four of five, including a stretch where they dropped two of three to the Tigers earlier this season. Their starter hasn’t been announced, which is either a masterclass in suspense or a sign that their rotation is a Russian nesting doll of mediocrity.

2. 'Chef Rat' pet (ratatouille reference), every 80s decrease cooking timer by 50 seconds. Or any pet tbh pls my timers are like an hour and a half.

3. make it so u only get prismatic and divine rewards when putting in prismatic food. No more corn or watering cans🙏

4. theres nothing to do in between cooking so make a questline to increase ""cooking mastery"" in order to decrease timer, increase size/quality/rank, and decrease ingredients needed. The quest could ask for certain ingredients or smth else (but since players kinda hate the minimum weight thingy lets brainstorm smth else ig)

5. make more cooking apliances as cosmetics instead of wutever the hell a fork fence and cheese mat is. i like the coffee machine. 

6. Every 20 minutes, there is a 5% chance a line of customers appear for 5 minutes. This event greatly boosts cooking speed, even including a chance to duplicate the food cooked once ready. The food experiences this event it has the chance to obtain the busy mutation and grant bonus rewards from Chef Chris P.

7. Add a hunger meter to Chris. P, when filled up, Chris P. gives additional rewards. 

thats all my ideas for now, had some really weird ones i thought of but deleted :P

1mhx20i,https://www.reddit.com/r/gencon/comments/1mhx20i/ttrpgfocused_personal_gencon_2025_experience/,TTRPG-focused personal GenCon 2025 Experience,"The last four years at GenCon ('22 - '25) I've focused entirely on non-D&D/PF2e RPGs, and generally have had really good experiences. I would say for me, this was kind of a down year, albeit still really fun and I don't regret going. Some general thoughts, first positives and then negatives.

* **Higher % of electronic tickets** \- On the positive side, I had only ONE paper ticket this year. This gave me the chance each day to look at slots that opened up and audible into new games. One of my favorite sessions this year was a last-minute switch into an EXCELLENT CoC Stillwater session on Thursday night.
* **Food Trucks** \- I love that they do this and that they had so many this year. On Friday I had no issue getting food, eating it, and then getting a coffee, using the bathroom, and getting to my next session in an hour in-between slots.
* **Other street vendors** \- In case you didn't notice, around the con center and hotels there were multiple other food and coffee vendors, many with small lines. Godsend especially if you need a quick coffee. This was great.
* **Event Cost** \- Ticket/event prices for TTRPGs seem to be going up. Most of my RPG sessions a few years ago were $4 and now many are $12-$24 for just a standard 3-4 hour RPG experience.
* **Placeholder names for DMs/GMs -** Last year I played a few sessions where authors were running their own published material (these were creators I knew I liked) and they were some of the best sessions ever. This year I prioritized a total of five of these - and all but two ended up just placeholder names, where the author name was plugged in as a placeholder (or in one case, the game's creative director). I think that's incredibly slimey.
* **DM's for hire** \- I can't stress enough the need for players to watch out for companies using very obvious DMs in it just for comps (badge, hotel). Magpie is obviously getting crushed for this but there are plenty of others out there too, and you can usually spot it; if a game isn't really THAT popular but for some reason is offering an outsized number of events and many are still open after the wishlist processing, that should be a red flag. The reason this matters IMO is that 1) you're more likely to see DM no-shows in those types of games, and 2) the DMs running those sessions often aren't invested in the game or the quality of the session (sometimes they haven't prepped at all - reading the module for the first time as they run it or have never run or played the game they're running.) I'm not saying they're ALL like that, but almost all my really bad experiences at GenCon directly tie back to this type of situation.
* **Popular TTRPGs without enough events** \- Every year I prioritize Call of Cthulhu, Delta Green, Mothership, and Free League games, and true to form, this year I got into exactly one of those games. It obviously doesn't matter since the con sells out anyway, but the quality of the experience of attendees would be a lot higher if they had more GMs running these in-demand games as they tend to have really energized GMs; to be fair there's a lot of CoC, it's just popular (and IMHO the sessions I've been in were ALL top-notch, both the players and GMs). This is likely a function of these companies not sponsoring any/enough DMs (compared to the note above) but it sucks for attendees who see buzz about games all year and then the biggest con of the year just doesn't have enough sessions available.

Of my 9 TTRPG sessions, I'd say I had 3 GREAT experiences, 2 GOOD experiences, 2 AVERAGE experiences, and 2 BAD experiences.

GREAT:

* Call of Cthulhu Iron Across the Desert - Great GM running his own (EXCELLENT) content, engaged table who mostly knew the game really well.
* DCC Precipice of Corruption - Great Judge running his own published module. Fun stuff.
* Weird Frontiers (DCC) An Occurence at Howling Crater - This was a premier ($50) ticket at the wizard van. Worth every cent. Really good small group of 4, FANTASTIC Judge, good module. Probably best of the con for me.

GOOD:

* DCC Purple Planet - Planet Maximus - Probably being unfair not putting this in the group above as this was extremely fun, it's more on me bc I didn't realize it wasn't so much an RPG as it was a cool prototype of an RPG/board game hybrid. I enjoyed this a LOT, but just didn't realize what I'd signed up for.
* DCC Sailors on the Starless Sea - Judge was really strong, play group was a little frustrating but that's on me for being an experience DCC player in a funnel with a bunch of newbies. (I've just managed to avoid reading or playing this one somehow and always wanted to.)

Not going to detail the others, but the Average ones had issues:

* One had multiple players unconcious in a system with no healing for an overly prolonged combat (like 2 hours) - that's bad GM'ing. People paid $24 for this session, and you're just leaving them knocked out with nothing to do for half of it (keeping in mind we had an NPC we'd picked up who one of them could've taken over!). Personally my PC stayed conscious so had fun, but I felt SO bad.
* One had a DM who had never run the game and was in a real life setting he didn't know at all, but it's a strong module and generally fun players so that balanced it out.

And the bad ones were, well, bad.

* One had an obvious ""DM for hire"" - I'm not sure he'd ever run the system before. He didn't have a rulebook or DM screen (of any kind, let alone for that game.) The module itself was 2 hours - we finished early. It was 5 rooms with a combat in each room. How fun.
* One had a DM I like and had a great session with last year, but the module he was given to run was a playtest for the company and TBH it just wasn't very good and he didn't seem prepared (or the material was bad, or both) AND the table of players was really rough. Some not engaged, some overly engaged, it just wasn't fun. It happens.

I also did my annual GCN show to see Call of Cthulu live. This show was average as far as GCN shows go. I think Troy needs to rethink his ""as many players as possible"" thing for these shows. 7 was just way too many. I'd rather see 4-5 of them shine than fight for air time. Also not every CoC one-shot needs to end in a ridiculous TPK.

All in all, this was a great GenCon with some quality of life improvements I appreciated.",8,1754360297.0,gencon,8,1.0,False

1mhwqup,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GrooveForLife/comments/1mhwqup/how_much_does_vanlife_cost_per_month_heres_the/,How Much Does Vanlife Cost Per Month? Here's the Real Breakdown (No Fluff),"So you’re sitting there, maybe stuck in traffic or zoning out at your desk job, thinking,  
“Man, it’d be *awesome* to just sell everything, hit the road, and live that vanlife dream.”

But then reality kicks in…

>

Glad you asked. Because I’ve been there, done that, burned through the budget, and had to figure out the *real* numbers the hard way. So here’s the straight talk—no fluff, no #blessed influencer nonsense.

# 🚐 The ""Bare Bones"" Budget ($800–$1,200/month)

This is for the *true minimalist*. If you're cool with:

* Cooking all your own meals
* Showering at Planet Fitness
* Sleeping on BLM land or Walmart parking lots
* And driving slow to save fuel

Then yeah, you can keep things around **$1,000 a month**. Here's how it typically breaks down:

* **Gas:** $150–$300 (depends how fast/far you drive)
* **Food:** $200–$300 (grocery store chef status)
* **Parking/Camping:** Free to $200
* **Phone/Data:** $60–$100 (Starlink addicts, you’ll pay more)
* **Van Insurance:** $100–$150
* **Random expenses:** $100 (laundry, oil changes, propane, snacks, the random weird stuff that *always* comes up)

It’s tight. But if freedom > comfort, it works.

# 🧘‍♀️ The Comfortable Nomad Budget ($1,200–$2,000/month)

This is where most full-timers land after a few months of figuring it out. You’ve got a groove going. Maybe you freelance, maybe you remote work. You hit up a coffee shop here and there, occasionally splurge on a real campground with Wi-Fi that *actually works*.

Your monthly costs might look like this:

* **Gas:** $200–$500
* **Food:** $300–$400 (mix of cooking and occasional dining out)
* **Campsites:** $150–$400 (a mix of free spots and paid ones with hookups)
* **Van Payment/Insurance:** If you’re financing a rig, tack on $300–$500
* **Phone/Data/Streaming:** $100+ (you *need* internet if you’re working)
* **Life stuff:** Gym, repairs, Netflix, dog food, random Amazon orders = $200–$300

You're looking at **$1,500–$2,000/month**, give or take. Still cheaper than rent in most cities, and the view out your window changes whenever you want.

# 💸 The ""Vanlife is My Instagram Brand"" Budget ($2,500–$3,500+)

This is for the folks with the decked-out Sprinters, solar setups that could power a spaceship, and daily matcha lattes. You’re traveling fast, taking epic detours, doing excursions, and maybe paying off a serious loan for that rig.

Here’s the reality:

* **Gas:** $500+ (especially if you chase the weather like a snowbird)
* **Luxury campgrounds:** $30–$100 *per night*
* **Meals out:** Adds up fast
* **Maintenance:** High-end rigs = high-end repair bills
* **Add-ons:** Satellite internet, van insurance, subscriptions, souvenirs

Budget? What budget? You’re looking at **$3,000/month easy**, sometimes more.

# Hidden Costs No One Talks About

Let me be real with you… vanlife will test your budget in sneaky ways:

* **Breakdowns:** Ever been towed in the desert? That’s a $500 day.
* **Weather detours:** Driving 1,000 miles to avoid a snowstorm? Yeah, hello fuel bill.
* **Hotels:** Sometimes your van breaks down and you need a night in a motel that smells like sadness.
* **Health insurance, dental, emergencies:** Still a thing on the road.

# So, how much does vanlife cost per month?

Short answer:

* **$1,000/month if you’re ultra-frugal**
* **$1,500–$2,000/month for most people**
* **$3,000+/month if you’re going big**

But here’s the kicker: It’s not about how *little* you can spend. It’s about designing a *sustainable* lifestyle that gives you freedom *and* peace of mind.

# Want to Build a Realistic Vanlife Budget?

If you’re serious about getting out of the 9-to-5 loop and making vanlife *actually work* financially, check out this book:  
👉 [**Vanlife: The Escape Plan**](https://amzn.to/4oqtB5k) by James Jernigan.

It’s not just another feel-good “quit your job and be free” book. It’s a blueprint—packed with real numbers, actionable advice, and a straight-up roadmap to fund a mobile lifestyle *without* wrecking your bank account.

I wish I had it when I started.

Anyway—hope this helped someone out there thinking about making the leap.

## Key Features Analysis

The most important characteristics to consider when choosing light wash blue jeans are the denim quality, fit, wash, and overall style. Examining these features closely will help you find a pair that suits your needs and preferences.

**Denim Quality:** The durability and feel of light wash jeans heavily depends on the type and weight of the denim.

Raw denim,though typically found in darker washes,is sometimes lightly washed for a rigid,high-quality feel that softens and molds to your body over time. Look for jeans made from 100% cotton or a blend with a small percentage of stretch for added comfort. The weight of the denim, measured in ounces, indicates its thickness and sturdiness; heavier denim is more durable but can also be less breathable.

**Fit and Style:** From skinny to wide-leg, and high-waisted to low-rise, the fit and style of jeans directly dictate the overall silhouette.

Consider your body type and personal style when choosing a fit. Slim-fit jeans offer a tailored look, while straight-leg jeans provide a classic, versatile option. Bootcut jeans are a good choice for wearing with boots, and wide-leg jeans offer a more relaxed, fashion-forward style. Rise, or waist height, impacts comfort and aesthetics; high-waisted jeans can elongate the legs, while mid-rise jeans offer a more conventional fit. Consider the inseam measurement to ensure the jeans are the proper length to complement your shoes.

**wash and Detailing:** The specific treatment of the denim defines the light wash appearance and includes fading, whiskering, and distressing.

A well-executed light wash shoudl appear natural and evenly distributed, avoiding harsh or artificial-looking contrasts. Subtle fading and whiskering around the thighs and knees add depth and character. Distressing,such as rips,tears,and frayed hems,can add a touch of edge,but be mindful of how much distressing is appropriate for different occasions.

**Hardware and Construction:** Seemingly minor, details of hardware and construction indicate a quality product.

Sturdy zippers, durable buttons, and reinforced pockets are indications of good craftsmanship. Look for jeans with a consistent stitch pattern and strong seams to ensure they will withstand regular wear and washing. Copper rivets at stress points provide added reinforcement and are a sign of quality.

Key features of high-quality Light Wash Blue Jeans include:

* Durable Denim
* Accurate Sizing
* Comfortable Fit
* Stylish Design
* Quality Hardware

You can even purchase “Stand Up for Science” merchandise in his honor. I often see a coffee mug advertised on Facebook. It is emblazoned with six statements, each supposedly settled once and for all, each uttered with equal authority, as though the science equivalent of the Nicene Creed:

 The earth is not flat.

Vaccines work.

We’ve been to the moon.

Chemtrails are not a thing.

Climate change is real.

Evolution is a fact.

You can get a tee shirt with the list. Modeling that tee-shirt is a fellow with a great long Darwinian beard. Yes, you can drink your coffee in your “Stand up for Science” mug while wearing your “Stand up for Science” tee-shirt and look just like Charles Darwin, your hero!

Imagine: Darwin is the face of science! Not Mendel, who discovered the mechanism for how Darwin’s ideas worked but who believed in a higher power, nor Newton, nor Galileo, nor Copernicus—all of whom believed in a higher power, but Darwin, who also nominally did (in his younger days, he trained to be a clergyman) but who smoothed the way for those who would not. Frankly, Jehovah’s Witnesses will have little issue with Darwin, insofar as the specific findings he points to. Finch modifications to meet changing conditions are no surprise at all to anyone familiar with animal husbandry. Witnesses only get squeamish from correctly anticipating the truckloads of dogma that atheists will drive through the door he cracks open.

Darwin certainly has not lost his place in the subset of science that is origin-of-life, but every subset needs its own tee shirt and coffee mug star. That honor falls to Stanley Miller, who in 1952 created a few amino acids in the lab among contrived conditions and thereafter held firm that such conditions must have prevailed in primordial earth—otherwise his findings could not have happened. If that seems like somewhat circular reasoning, consider that Dr. Hazen says as much: “Most previous origin researchers have fallen into a kind of trial-and-error approach to devising hypotheses; they would cook up some likely geochemical recipe and run an experiment. If the experiment did something interesting, they patched together a theory around those observations.” . . .

From the appendix of: 'A Workman's Theodicy: Why Bad Things Happen'

(I was recently asked a question on the Miller experiment. It is a mainstay of college evolution that I certainly learned there and probably also in high school. Rather than answer it privately, I put it here. If one person wonders about it, likely others do too. It is part of a long appendix section in the book, based on my observations of an 'Origins-of-Life' Great Courses lecture series by Dr. Robert Hazen that I monitored.)",1,1754359092.0,Eutychus,0,1.0,False

Let’s Settle This Once and For All!,"Okay, hear me out… GIFT CARDS! Are these genius or the single most confusing modern gift?? I need someone to break this down with me, because every time I pick one up at the checkout lane, I feel both like a highly evolved gift-giving superhero AND a total slacker!

Seriously, there are people who *love* getting gift cards—like, their face lights up. But is it because of the freedom, or... because they know what they want and you just gave them Power to Buy? Is this thoughtful or just a passcode to a virtual shopping free-for-all? I'm torn!

Let’s break this down with some PROS, because, wow, there are a lot:

- Super convenient (buy on your way to the party, done!)
- No risk of buying an “oops-I-don’t-even-own-a-cat” mistake gift
- Massive flexibility for the recipient, mountains of potential shopping happiness

But then…the CONS:

- It sometimes feels like a cop-out? Like, could I have just handed you cash and left?
- What if it sits in their wallet, encased in plastic, ANXIOUSLY WAITING to be used until it expires? Wasted money, ultimate sad.
- Some people read them as “I couldn’t think of what you would actually want.”

Here’s where my gift card confusion *peaks*—does the “luxury” of the gift equation get totally lost here? Or am I actually giving luxury, because someone has the freedom to splurge at their favorite place? SO MANY QUESTIONS!

https://goodnovel.org/

Have you ever given a gift card and felt like a genius, but saw subtle “oh, you shouldn’t have…(but you definitely should have put more money on it)” face? Or, reverse: gotten a gift card and been like YES—Target Run Freedom!—but also wondered if it’s just a sign your gift charisma is misunderstood?

Bullet-point dilemma moments I’ve personally experienced:

- Gift card to a luxury coffee shop = excited for weeks  
- Gift card to a sporting goods store when recipient does *not sport* = decade-long confusion  

Are retailers masterminding a new form of guilt-free, user-driven gifting, or is this just modern lazy chic?

Pause. Consider this: If you were gifting luxury, would a $200 “anything” card trump a handpicked *something*? IS CHOICE THE REAL LUXURY?

https://goodnovel.org/

I absolutely love the *concept*—there’s this hope that every gift card unlocks a perfect, secret desire. But…am I projecting? Do they gather dust or become prized golden tickets?

Endless questions, so many swipe-able gifts.

I want to know: Have YOU nailed the perfect gift card occasion, or is it still the wild west of gifting out here? When is a gift card the most brilliant, luxury gesture, and when is it just a five-second afterthought? I’m excited/hopelessly lost and I need your stories!

I apologize if this Iong winded, feel free to skim, skip, whatever haha. I don’t necessarily need or want advice aside from recommendations for books on religious/mormon trauma and anyone who understands to sit and commiserate with me❤️

I’m just so angry lately. I left the church over 6 years ago and it’s like I’ve delayed processing it until now. I just woke up mad and sad one day and now I just have to carry it 24/7??? I know it’s important for me  to finally feel all this after spending my entire life burying every negative emotion (blessed are the peacemakers 😘✌️), but its so fucking uncomfortable to have nowhere for all this anger to go.  

I finally started therapy a few months ago, and now understand that I have several different mental health issues that cause the anxiety and depression I’ve always thought was the main problem. Every last one of them is affected, whether directly or indirectly, by growing up in the church. I have OCD and developed moral scrupulosity as my main theme which is a hell I wouldn’t wish on anyone. Undiagnosed ADHD until 27. A mild eating disorder off and on. Maybe autism?? Wrap it all up with CPTSD, my latest diagnosis, which makes it all such a confusing tangle you don’t know where one issue ends and the next begins! I learned how to mask and dissociate from it all at a very young age because I felt like if I let any flaws show, everyone would figure out that I’m actually a complete fraud. 

I became obsessed with being percieved as what I had decided was the perfect Mormon- not a weird, cringy Molly Mormon, but the perfect Mormon who could still pass as a Normal Person; one everyone would look at from afar and say “she’s just so good”. I took “be an example” and fucking RAN with it. I wanted my Mormon friends to be impressed by my testimony and unwavering faith but not to think I was superior or stuck up about it. I wanted my non-Mormon friends to think it was so cool that I was so religious but not a freak about it. I wanted to be cool and fun and carefree enough for them to accept me but maintain strong enough in my values that they would never even try to tempt me with alcohol, drugs, or god-forbid, coffee. I felt the weight of the church’s reputation in small town Midwest on my very young shoulders. It was not healthy and I became a chronic people pleaser to avoid the discomfort of feeling different. 

I was so determined to fit in in every group I was in, that I eventually disconnected entirely from my own opinions, thoughts, feelings. I became a skilled personality sculptor, molding myself hour by hour to be as close as possible the person everyone else wanted me to be. I completely dialed in to everyone else’s emotions, trying to sense what they wanted or needed me to be or do for them before they knew it themselves, so they never even had a chance to be angry, sad, or disappointed in me. I kept my circle very small, cutting out people who (I thought) needed a person I simply couldn’t be one by one until there was no one left who really knew my authentic self. Eventually, I lost touch with her too. 

By my early teens, I started treating my life like a checklist as a coping mechanism for having no real identity outside of “daughter of God” or any clue what I really wanted out of life. Luckily enough, the church pretty much handed said checklist to me, wrapped in a bow as a gift the minute I was given a name, a blessing, and, most importantly, membership number. I was given a literal plan of happiness, and by 8 I had fully committed. I checked every single one of them off that list, the carrot of eternal happiness always just out of reach, propelling me forward to the life I was told I wanted, not a single thought about whether or not I actually did. 

- I finished personal progress before I graduated high school, not so early that I looked like a tryhard but not so late I looked lazy 
- I had a couple boyfriends so everyone knew I was a) straight (I’m not lol) and b) still a cool normal girl (also not what I am lol), but not so many that people in the ward would think I was a slut
- Graduated HS and seminary with honors and a BYU acceptance letter. 
- Got heavily involved in campus and my YSA ward
- Dated very intentionally with the end goal of marriage
- Waited a respectable amount of time to get engaged (second semester junior year, I was 20, we had been dating for 4 months LOL)
- got married (as a virgin of course!!) in the temple
- waited a respectable amount of time before getting pregnant so that no one would think we rushed into it (LOL) but also not so late people would wonder what was taking so long (18 months LOL)
- graduated with a mommy major (sfl human development girlies where you at) that still had potential for a return to grad school if I wanted to later (gotta make sure people still know I’m smart)
- all culminating with having my first baby by 23! The perfect age to not be considered too young but also not old (like 25 omg)!! 

I never once thought about my life beyond that, and the prescribed life itinerary got fuzzy past this point. Motherhood was supposed to be the pinnacle of my life, so I kept it on the pedastal the church, my leaders, and my own parents had created for me. I practically worshiped it. I knew that while life would still have its challenges, once I got pregnant, everything would finally start fall into place naturally because this is what I was born for, what God wanted MOST for me! I wasn’t dumb, I knew it wouldn’t be easy. But I was promised over, and over, and over that it would be THE MOST REWARDING, FULFILLING, GODLY THING I WOULD EVER DO. Plus I babysat like, a LOT as a teenager so I had plenty of experience obviously!!

And then she was born, and at first, every moment was so beautiful, fun, and even fulfilling— just like they said it would be! It even still is in some ways. I love my children. They are absolutely incredible, and while I don’t know exactly what I believe spiritually anymore, there are parts of being their mom that do feel genuinely sacred to me. Watching them grow from little helpless things to people with thoughts and opinions and ideas and natural talents and morals both taught and self discovered??? Indescribably cool. They are so funny and smart and just so GOOD, and I cannot believe I MADE them! They are the two of the lights of my life, and I genuinely do find it a privilege to be their mom. 

The truth is, I love being their mom but I do not like motherhood. It has taken me 7 years to be able to admit that, and I still don’t think I’ve said it out loud. It is beautiful but it brings out an ugly side of me. It’s fulfilling in the long term, but physically, emotionally, and mentally draining in the day to day. It’s triggering to see the things I hate most about myself mirrored in the perfect tiny people I made. It’s overwhelming to be so needed when I feel like I barely have enough to keep myself alive. Rest is rarely actually restful, due to a million interruptions and intense guilt and shame about not having earned it. There’s just so much to do, and there will never be enough time, energy, and resources to do it all. 

We have lived in poverty since our eldest was born, because we believed what had been drilled into us from childhood— that God would provide. He did not. I felt (and still feel!) guilt and shame around our finances, because it seemed like a clear indication that we were doing not doing enough to be eligible for the financial blessings of paying tithing. I literally did not have anything left to give, emotionally or monetarily. I felt shame and embarrassment that we didn’t have as much as my wealthy friends from BYU, who were already buying McMansions and designer bamboo sleepers for their 4th baby. 

We lived outside of our means in order to keep up with the Jensens and Nelsons and Smiths and Flakes and Kimballs. I had no concept of budgeting or finances because my parents supported me up until I got married, and I never bothered to learn about it because I was uninterested and assumed it would just be my husband’s job. We now have to live with family because my husband (who also has severe mental health issues and trauma) just doesn’t have the earning potential to support all of us here (high COL area), but we also can’t afford to move somewhere cheaper, nor do we want to leave our support system. We can’t afford the childcare we’d need for me to work full time unless I go back to school first, which we can’t afford without me working full time for several years first!!! Of course money can’t buy happiness, but it does provide peace of mind and comfort, which is something I desperately crave. Who knows, maybe we would still be living like this even if we never had kids or waited longer, but it cannot be denied as a significant factor in my situation now. 

I eventually sank into severe depressive episode and had near mental breakdown that landed me in a 12 week intensive outpatient therapy program earlier this year. I’m better than before, but my handle on life is still tenuous at best. I feel like I’m slowly rebuilding a Jenga tower and someone keeps taking blocks out one by one before I’m done. Sometimes it stays up, just a little less stable than before, and sometimes it all crashes down and I’m starting from nothing again. 

I wish I could sue the church for tithing repayment, child support, lost wages for what I could’ve been making in the work force during the 6 years I was a stay at home mom, lost wages for what all of my unpaid labor in the home at that time was worth, AND emotional damages. It might just be enough for an apartment and (some of) the therapy we all need. 

anyway, if you made it this far… thanks for letting me ramble and whine. I know I will get through this and come out the other side, but I just wish I could fucking teleport there. ",11,1754358974.0,Deconstruction,1,0.87,False
1mhwjes,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/1mhwjes/event_last_chance_for_iraq/,[EVENT] Last Chance for Iraq,"There's just *one* more chance...

While the Coordination Framework, a group of Shi'a Arab, pro-Iranian, parties in Iraq delivered a truly era defining victory—they had no legislative majority themselves. And, even with their allies in the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and about half of all the independents in the Iraqi legislature, they were far below the 2/3rds majority required to elect a President.

In a system as dysfunctional as Iraq, chaos is the norm. Just one generation ago US forces stormed across the border and let waged a destructive, bloody, and costly counter-insurgency campaign. It was just a decade ago Daesh rose from the sands of al-Anbar and, with just 1,000 soldiers (maybe as little as 100!) they stormed Iraq's second largest city of Mosul and ignited a regional crisis. In 2021, the Iraqi legislature failed to elect a President and it lead to a political crisis which saw anti-Iranian Shi'a cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's supporters storm the Iraqi parliament. The pillars of Iraqi state were built on sand, and, in fact, most of the population have given up on the state they were apart of. Sectarian conflict was rife, militia groups were running amok, and foreign powers easily made inroads into government.

And one number hung over the Iraqi state's heads like a noose:

# 32.3% turnout...

More than 2/3rds of Iraq had given up on this system. All it would take was one *push* for everything to come crashing down.



\-



As the Iraqi legislature finally gathered to elect a President. Nouri al-Maliki was on the frontlines whipping votes for the proposal. Iraq had a system similar to Lebanon (why Lebanon...) where sectarian groups shared positions of power: the Kurds got the Presidency, the Shi'a Arabs the Prime Ministership, and the once dominant Sunni Arabs were humbled by being made Speaker of the Iraqi House of Representatives. But as Iraqi House of Representatives sat down and began the process to elect the Iraqi President, the first step to forming a new government, people began to leave.

It was like... like a balloon slowly deflating... As Nouri wrangled his own supporters into submission, he looked on in a slow dawning horror for the ""Man of Steel"". It was as if the *entire* chamber left. When the roll call was finally finished only 45% of all the legislatures remained in their seats. In Iraq, you needed 2/3rds of the entire legislature—its entirety, not just those present—to elect a President. While Nouri and his Coordination Framework deluded themselves into just redoubling their efforts and trying again next week, everyone else knew the real thing: **Iraq was dying**.



\-



And then... something came in the news: *a bribery ring unlike anything Iraq had seen*. Corruption, or as some people tried to downplay it, ""patronage,"" was always a quirk, not a problem, in the Iraqi system. But this had never been before seen. When it leaked that the Saudi Arabian government had sent more than half a billion dollars in massive bribes and payoffs to various Iraqi parties and even militias, the Coordination Framework was incensed. It was an easy job for the CF to change the optics: the Sunni, Wahhabist, monarchy of Saudi Arabia—already called the father of Daesh in some circles—was funding all these (mostly Sunni Arab) parties... many Shi'a Arabs were incensed. Soon after, in coffee shops and on x (formerly known as twitter) people began talk of a, ""Judeo-Saudi,"" conspiracy to destroy Iraq. People were incensed, enraged, and saw the whole walkout in the legislature as a way to destroy Iraq and create a Sunni supremacist state.

Meanwhile, it seemed like two Iraqs were forming. In Sunni Arab Iraq, most people did not care or the stories were actively suppressed. In Baghdad, the Emtidad Movement, a group of young Iraqis who espoused nonsectarianism, quickly gained steam and used it as a way to attract tens of thousands of Iraqis to march with them on the street and protest the system; this was despite them being implicated in the Saudi money scandal. And finally, amongst the loyal and fervent followers of Muqtada al-Sadr, they quickly issued refrains that it was not Saudi Arabia who was the true enemy, but Iran.

It was as if two Iraqs were birthed out of one. You had almost two polar opposite Iraqs reading different stories and coming out with completely polar opposite takes out of them. While this may have just gone along for a few months (maybe years) and eventually, somehow, things would heal and we would *finally* form a new government... earth-shattering news came from Iran—literally.



\-



As a massive bombing campaign against Iran began, all initiated by the United States, it was all able to cause Iraq to descend into **chaos**.

Real power comes from the barrel of a gun; the leader of a multitude of various pro-Iranian militias in Iraq was beginning to move *quickly*. **Hadi al-Amiri** was the leader of the Fatah Alliance, Iraq's second largest political party, and the de-facto commander of various pro-Iranian militias. He was a folk hero amongst the Shi'a Arabs, in some quarters of the country called a hero for how he stopped Daesh's advance onto Baghdad. He always prided himself on how he dealt with the problem, and for that he was awarded with the pride and honor of millions of Shi'a Arab Iraqis.

But with the political system paralyzed, al-Amiri looked on in abject horror as he saw the, ""Judeo-Saudi,"" conspiracy come to fruition: Americans were bombing Tehran and the enemies of Iraq were surrounding the country. He knew, deep in his bones, what his only recourse was. If Iran were to fall, Iraq would fall to the foot soldiers of Daesh, all funded by the evil, satanic even, Israeli and Saudi states. He was convinced on what his only recourse was.

The mind of al-Amiri wandered into dark places. When he was questioned by reporters on the ongoing American strikes in Iran, al-Amiri danced into domestic politics. When he quibbled about a, ""Judeo-Saudi conspiracy to destroy our republic,"" the reporter urged him on. He then uttered something which had never been uttered by an Iraqi political elite: ""The conspiracy to destroy our country runs deep. You see, even supposed holy men like Muqtada al-Sadr—I mean he's... he's getting hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and needs to be hanged like that dog Saddam.""

The response from Muqtada al-Sadr was equal and proportionate. ""\[al-Amiri\] is a traitor to our republic and our people. He is a whore who sells himself out to Iran. He needs to be put down like the dog he is.""

Al-Amiri decided this was enough. He called forth his militias and gave them on order: ***begin mobilizing***.

I’m a 36, and you can usually find me with paint on my hands, books stacked everywhere, who has a soft spot for voice chats that last way too long. I actually found love on Reddit once, and while that chapter’s closed, I’m back, heart open, hoping lightning might strike twice.

I’ve always felt drawn to the warmth, joy, and expressiveness I’ve experienced in Latino culture—and I’d love to meet a Hispanic/Latino man who values connection, conversation, and building something meaningful together.

I believe that strong, open and honest communication that is rooted in respect for eachother is Paramount to a successful long term relationship. I'm a romantic, and my nose is always stuck in a book. I prefer my coffee iced. Currently into lbuilding tiny worlds (book nook addict here). 420 friendly. Voice chats are my love language. Text is great, but hearing your laugh? Thats where things come to life.

I chase the feeling of a summer drive with the windows down, music up, and iced coffee in hand—that wind-in-your-hair freedom? I crave that daily. It feels so nostalgic to me.

I’m a bigger girl, but currently on a whole journey. Ask me about my recent accomplishment! I've been putting in work the past two years on my physical & mental health. It's all about continuing to grow, & how incredible would it be to have you by my side. I’m proud, I’m real, and I’m showing up fully.

Long-term, I dream of a duplex-style love: we live next door, have our own spaces, but drift between each other’s homes like we invented slow romance. Our offices of course, will have his/hers gaming setups. You take decorative control of yours, and i'll take my side (It's about compromise right?!)

Not looking to have kids, but I do want connection, laughter, shared dreams, and maybe a shared Amazon Prime account someday (We can binge our favorite shows together).

If you’re kind, emotionally available, love voice chatting, and maybe have some rhythm (or at least the confidence to dance badly in the kitchen), I’m already curious.

1mhwfmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/peanutallergy/comments/1mhwfmv/is_this_normal_or_was_he_using_his_allergies_to/,Is this normal or was he using his allergies to control me?,"I dated a guy for a short amount of time - I was very much into him, more than I've ever been into anyone before, but I had to break it off because I was worried that I might have gotten myself into a coercive control type of situation. Even though this relationship ended a few months ago,  I sometimes wonder if I might have overreacted and ruined a good thing. Hoping to get the perspective of other redditors who have allergies or have experience dating someone with allergies. 

Here is what happened:

He told me on the first date that he had severe anaphalactic food allergies (nuts, soy, mushrooms, many things). 

At first he said that in order for us to kiss, I couldn't eat any nuts for a couple of days beforehand, which seemed reasonable to me (I admittedly don't know a lot about this stuff and I trusted - possibly naiively - that he knew what he was talking about). He also said that he only felt comfortable kissing me for the first time if his mom was present in the next room over, just in case he had a reaction (I thought this was a bit awkward given that we are both 30-something year old adults but I somehow agreed to it - laugh all you want but in my defense this man was damn fine).

After the first kiss, the rules just seemed to get stricter and stricter over time. Next he said that I couldn't eat anything that had even POSSIBLE cross-contamination with nuts at least 4 days before I kissed him (including home-cooked meals prepared by my family or meals at a restaurant that were not on his approved list of ""safe"" restaurants, even meals like pizza that did not explicitly contain nuts but might have come into contact with nuts during the cooking process). 

At one point, when I was at his place, I told him I wanted to step out for a minute to grab a coffee at McDonalds. He said that he wanted to ""live a little"" and try a McDonald's McMuffin. But only if his parents came with us. So before I know it, I've got his whole family (whom I barely know) packed into my car and I'm driving us all to the closest McDonald's. I was so nervous that I drove over a curb. 

I eventually found out from a throwaway comment that his mom made that he hadn't seen an allergist or gotten retested in 16 years - I found this to be quite odd given how much his allergies seemed to dictate his life. This was also mildly infuriating given that I was out here giving up my beloved Nutella and eating at restaurants, and basically rearranging my whole life to accommodate for his allergies while he didn't seem to be doing anything himself to manage them (I still can't believe I did all of this but I swear I was infatuated by this man). 

I talked to some other couples I know that include a partner with allergies and they said that what he was asking me to do was WAY over the top. From my internet research, I did find some literature suggesting a couple should wait at least 4 hours after nuts were eaten to kiss, but I could not for the life of me find anything that said 4 days. 

When I gently confronted him about his seemingly made up ""rules"", he said things like ""I've lived with my allergies my whole life, I think I'm the expert here"" ""all of my exes gave up nuts without question"" ""my ex who was a vegan started eating meat because she couldn't eat nuts anymore"" and ""are you trying to kill me?!"" ""If this is too much for you, you can eat whatever you want then, but we can never kiss"". It was starting to give the vibe of emotional manipulation - as if he was trying to exploit my empathetic/understanding/conscientious nature and punish me for not complying with his rules by withdrawing affection and guilt-tripping. 

He eventually agreed to go see an allergist with me to clarify what the actual recommendations were but these referrals can take time and sadly we didn't last that long. 

The last straw was when he started saying that when I go out with my friends, we should only go to his ""safe"" restaurants (even when he wasn't there himself). When I pushed back against this, he made comments implying that there was something wrong with my character (""I expected you to be more empathetic given that you work in a helping profession"") and even my intelligence (i.e. I just wasn't smart enough to understand his allergies, that I was just ""hyperfixating"" on his allergies because of my ADHD). I hung up the phone because I just cannot allow a man to speak to me like that. I felt psychologically unsafe talking to him. 

The whole thing was just so confusing. Am I just overly paranoid about dating? Was he just extremely anxious about his allergies after being traumatized from going into anaphalactic shock as a child? Or was he using his allergies to control me? I mean, if so, I have to admit, it's pretty clever, because how do you argue with someone's medical condition? There were some other red flags too (which I foolishly ignored) like love bombing and rushing the relationship a mile a minute. 

Is what he was asking for typical, or was I right to be like WTF?!  

Also, is it normal for a person with severe anaphalactic allergies to not see an allergist for 16 years? (Living in Canada)

I was starting to suspect that maybe he was purposely avoiding seeing the allergist because he knew they would tell him that his restrictions were not reasonable and he'd no longer be able to use them to control people. But that could be a stretch. ",2,1754358615.0,peanutallergy,6,1.0,False

This was definitely feeling like less of a coincidence, especially when the rain subsided shortly after ducking back into the cave. I know this decision is the one of a horror movie character who eventually ends up sodomized by an eldritch creature, but I was still compelled to explore the cave further. At least around the bend, I mean I made it out here for this specific reason so why back out now? So, against my better judgement, I ventured further into the passage.

Maggie stayed as close as she could, but she was in the way so I stepped over her and kept the dog behind me; I could feel her freezing, damp snout bumping against my calf. I kept the flashlight in my left hand with the gun resting on top and pointed forward, it’s probably something I saw in movies. Nonetheless, I did notice for a second what I was doing and thought about how I probably looked pretty cool. Then I shook my head and muttered, “idiot”, aloud before concentrating again at the task ahead.

The closer I got to the left-hand turn, the thicker the atmosphere felt, like walking into a pressurization chamber. I was at the turn and shined the light down further, it looked mostly the same but leading to a dead end. There was a lump sitting on the ground. It could’ve been a rock, trash, animal, or even a person; it was impossible to tell detail from here. I looked back to see my path of escape one last time and rounded into the turn. This felt like being birthed. I don’t know how else to describe it, but it was like being pushed through a threshold which released me unto the world for the first time again. It left me proud, yet uneasy at my brave and/or stupid decision of exploring the chasm.

I pushed further, might as well reach the dead end now and see what the lump is. My approach was slow and methodical, I felt my feet float beneath me. I was walking on air, or at least it felt like I was. I glanced down for a moment and my shoes were still planted by the gravity of Earth.

The lump grew in size the closer I was, the light began to illuminate and reveal man-made material. It was a pile of trash. Wait no, that’s clothing. My flashlight moved up from the shoes to pants, shirt, and finally the face.

I didn’t linger on the body, he had olive drab cargo shorts and a grey polo on, but I didn’t need to see much to remember that face. He had dark hair in a Caesar cut, a clean shave with a butt-chin, a silver stud earring, and soft green eyes. The body had to be fresh, it even looked like he still had an oily complexion to his skin, but he was motionless and not breathing. I called out to no response. I walked up and stood over his body, there was a name a cactus green nametag that said his name was “Eric”. I finally noticed his greasy smile, contorted so far into his cheeks that it looked painful.

I gathered myself and ran back toward my car through the thunderstorm. My old foe, the sugar sand slowed my progress immensely as I was beginning to get pelted by hail. The hail turned into blinding lightning followed by a thunderous roar; Maggie kept pace ahead of me but would stop periodically to make sure I caught up. She waited under a tree for me to reach her. A precision strike was released by Zeus, hitting the branch she was resting under. Sparks flew off the wood and I raced toward my dog; she pounced backward when the branch fell from the skies, this lucky dog narrowly dodged death again. I jumped the branch like I was in a timed hurdle event. We made it back to the car mildly bruised and completely exhausted. I was relieved we made it. I drove home mostly in silence, I checked the dog to make sure she was okay first, “Jesus Maggie, why the hell’d we wait so long to leave?”

I arrived home to find my girlfriend attempting to cook dinner, she wasn’t the best chef, but I’d appreciate anything of comfort after a day like today. Maggie and I entered from the garage door and simultaneously shook ourselves dry; I kissed the baby who was playing in her highchair at the counter, she was getting so big I could hardly believe how fast seven months had gone by.

“Oh hey, babe! I talked to your Nana, and she gave me the family’s risotto recipe, so I figured I’d try it tonight. That, okay?” Jasmine looked over her shoulder toward us.

“Yeah, that sounds great. Do you need any help?”

“No, you just get yourself freshened up. I left a beer for you in the bathroom.”

“Is it my birthday? Do I get a blowie later too?” I say, crossing my fingers in front of my face with a smirk.

“Why do you ruin things? Can’t a woman just be nice to her man sometimes? And don’t push your luck too hard, I was in the mood until that comment.” She gave me a wink and my stomach fluttered like we were in high school again.

“All right, well I’m gonna shower. Maggie and I barely made it out of the trail with this weather!”

“Really? It was fine over here.”

“Yeah, I’ll tell you about it later.” I ran down to the bathroom and took a shower, making sure to chug the beer and masturbate first, in case she wasn’t bluffing. Once I was done, I headed back up to the kitchen on time to be a taste tester.

Jasmine stared at me blinking softly, “Does it taste like it should?”

“You know, it might even be better.”

“No, shut up.” She playfully pushes me in the chest.

“No seriously, I don’t know how you did it, but this is great. I’m surprised.”

“Well, you’re not supposed to be surprised like that. I’m not that bad a cook.”

I suck my teeth and roll my eyes, “I didn’t say that, but let’s not forget who asked who how to boil water.”

“Oh, fuck you. We were kids, and I asked how to cook macaroni.” Jasmine eyes smirk although she presents a scowl.

“We were twenty, Jazz. And yeah, same thing.” I chortle and break her faux-tough demeanor. We kiss and she nut taps me as we pull apart, I twist her nipple in retaliation, and she chases me with the wooden spoon as I run away. After a few minutes of playing around, I went to feed the dogs, and we finally settled down to eat dinner. Jasmine always eats slower than me, she jokes about how I eat like Bart and Maggie, not even tasting my food. Since I was finished by her half-way point, I took it upon myself to start feeding the baby. Pennie was starting to ween off breast milk. The past month we’ve been trying to get her to eat softer foods. Kids seems to be the same no matter their exact age, Pennie’s favorite is macaroni and cheese, but I think mom’s new dish might be a close second.

“So, how was your walk today?” Jasmine broke through the noise of my baby talk, then taking the last bite of her food.

“Oh uh, it was good I suppose… other than the weather.”

“That’s good, why’d you feel like you barely made it out? And why didn’t you take Bart with you?” She cocked her head to the side a little when asking. I had no response; I didn’t know why only Maggie and I went on the walk. I mean Jazz was working from home and watching the baby, but there’s no reason I couldn’t have taken the other dog with us. “Just because Maggie is your favorite doesn’t mean you can neglect her brother.”

“Yeah, I don’t know why I didn’t take him. As mean as it sounds, I just didn’t think of him, I guess. I’ll bring Bart next time to get him out of your hair.” I feel like there’s something I needed to tell someone, but it’s on the tip of my tongue. I told her all the story I could remember about the walk; I didn’t tell her I felt like I was forgetting anything. It must not have been important, but damn was it eating at me. She seemed unimpressed by my tale.

The rest of our family’s night together was great. Jazz and I watched a documentary about Plato; it talked about being taught by Socrates, the foundation of his academy, and about his book *The Republic.* Most of it was interesting trivia knowledge but forgettable overall; however, the one thing that stuck with me was Plato’s allegory of the cave, not sure why.

Eventually the baby passed out and left Jazz and I with some much-needed alone time. After all was said and done, we turned the lights off to go to sleep, but I just laid there. I couldn’t sleep, something was eating at the back of my mind, and I couldn’t figure out what. I sat up and looked down at the foot of the bed and see Bart sleeping like an angel, not even snoring, but when I looked at Maggie, she was staring back at me. She couldn’t sleep either, she looked uncomfortable, like when we visited a friend’s house that she hasn’t been to before. I laid back down and with much effort coaxed myself to sleep, all I could see in my dreams was an image of a warping, breathing cave.

\*\*\*

I awoke to Jasmine sliding into her mesh office chair and booting her employee computer on, ever since Covid, her job was remote four days a week. “Hey, need me to get up? How’s the baby?” I groaned through the sleep in my eyes.

“She’s fine, you can go back to bed. I’ll wake you if I need you.” Jasmine peered at me through clouded glasses, the steam emanated from her matte-black Lake Tahoe mug, her button chin hidden behind it.

“Fuck it I’m awake… That coffee smells great anyways.” I sat up, throwing the sheets forward and swinging my legs to the floor. Looking down at my rolled body and soft nipples I sigh. I raised myself to my feet and gave Jazz a kiss on the head, then departed for the kitchen.

Maggie followed me to the kitchen and stared up at me as I made my coffee, Bart was in the bedroom still. I called for Bart and let both dogs outside, but Maggie stepped out only to turn around and sit, staring at me. That’s odd, I guess she just wanted attention. I stood in the doorway petting Maggie and enjoying my coffee, it was a beautiful day in Florida for summer. No overcast and it couldn’t have been warmer than 80 degrees. I let Bart finish and convinced Maggie back inside with a treat, I don’t blame her, the weather was an anomaly, and I wanted back outside too.

I made Jasmine’s favorite breakfast of corned beef hash with an egg, it sounded good to me at the time, and we had a can left sitting in the pantry. It was also something the baby could eat. Pennie was awake at this point and was being playful, I fed her my leftovers and put her in the bouncer to follow me around. I came back into the bedroom to plan my day.

“Hey, don’t forget that you have that meeting with Eric about your new book.” Jasmine stated this as a matter of fact. Who’s Eric? The name sounds familiar, but I can’t place a face to it. “So do what you have to today, but that’s at seven o’clock, so don’t make plans with Jason tonight.”

“Yeah, yeah. Can you watch Pennie real quick, I’m gonna hop in the shower.” I start to remove my basketball shorts and Jasmine nods her head. The transition from the bedroom rug to the bathroom tile is shocking but satisfying and does a better job at waking me up than the coffee did. “Where are we meeting again?” The shower turned on to the perfect temperature, and without any squealing from the pipes.

“He’s taking you to dinner downtown, some new place called Byte. Says it’s on him, so bring me back some leftovers.” I can hear the sarcasm in her voice, but if this was a book deal with the cards in my hands then I might as well get her a meal, it’s probably on some write-off corporate account anyways.

“Sounds fancy.” The shower was refreshing. I gathered myself and figured I’d go on another walk after a quick workout, but this time I’d bring Bart too. I still can’t think of why I left him at home, but he’d get his steps today. After the walk it was time to write and waste time until the meeting later that night.

I made it to the trail around noon with Bart and Maggie, when I exited the car, I realized the city had put in a trashcan at the head of the trail. I decided to act civilized and pick up the dogs’ poop, I had no excuses not to anymore. The walk was extraordinary, it was the first time I can think of where I wasn’t swarmed with insects, sweating my dick off. It was a welcome change.

Things did get odd about halfway to our turn around point. The entire time Maggie seemed like she was on a mission, she constantly pulled as if she was going somewhere with purpose. Bart was relaxed and stuck next to me, which was a relief because he outweighs his sister by about sixty pounds (Maggie was the runt). But then we reached the halfway mark and Maggie suddenly veered off left into the woods. She was still on a leash so she didn’t get very far, but Maggie would not budge. Eventually I had to physically pick her up and put her back on the walking trail, but as soon as her paws touched the ground, she’d immediately dart back into the woods. I will admit, I was rather frustrated at this point and decided to cut the walk short. I resorted to carrying Maggie back to the car, a look of unease rested upon her jowls.

When we arrived home Maggie acted mostly normal, she must’ve not slept much the night previous, or the constant pulling wore her out because she quickly laid down for a nap at my feet. By this time, I was writing and killing time for the meeting, I was excited but still couldn’t get a thought of who this Eric could be. Surely if he was my manager or a publisher, I would recognize him when I arrived at the restaurant.

Writing came easier today than it normally does, the walk must’ve gotten me properly warmed up. I didn’t feel as if I was forcing anything onto the page. The words flowed out of me in the most cliché of ways, I felt like I had a beautiful mind but less numbers and more letters.

Jasmine finished work a couple of hours before I had to leave so I decided to take a break and spend some time with her and the baby. I had written seventeen pages in the past three hours which was a much faster pace than I normally kept. This also gave me the excuse of having a drink, for a job well done.

Six o’clock came faster than I wanted it to, I had to start getting ready to meet the illustrious Eric. I developed a knot in my stomach that begun as soon as I left for the meeting. I must’ve been nervous; this was possibly my first book deal so that should be natural.

I arrived at Byte five minutes early and the valet took the keys to my rattle-can red Mazda 3 hatchback, it didn’t fit in with the rest of the cars when he parked it in between a forest green Range Rover and the Shelby kit car. I brushed the dog hair off my blazer and made sure to set my watch to fifteen minutes ahead; I didn’t want Eric to see I was too lazy to put a new battery in the watch.

Byte was an old building with brick steps leading up to French doors with stained glass in the windows, there was a porch running across the front of the restaurant with a couple lounging sections for when parties are waiting for their table. I walked in and was greeted by a host stand directly to my right, I gave the blonde hostess my name and she began to direct me toward my table. We walked out of the foyer into a large dining room with five sections separated by blurred glass held up by dark wood frames. Each section could fit twenty-five people comfortably, one section seemed to be one big party while the other four were mixed parties sitting at different tables. I was taken into the fourth section if looking from left to right, it was scattered with miscellaneous groups of people; some on dates, some families, but all of them appeared to be enjoying the food and their company. I scanned the section, I saw one man sitting alone in a round booth; it was Eric, I recognized him.

\*\*\*

I investigated the man in the booth’s soft green eyes, there was a malicious desperation that gave me the sense I was in danger. I looked down to see his greasy, contorted smile. For a moment the background chatter and noises of a bustling restaurant died, I noticed the people all around remained motionless and now only the man, Eric, and I stood in a dead lock. I heard a groan seep out from his smile, but his lips didn’t move. It grew louder and louder until it sounded as if a diesel engine was revving uncontrollably in front of me. Eventually I could make out that the groaning was a word, Eric was saying, “Run.”

I had a flooding of memories which had been wiped from the day previous. This was the man in the cave. Wait, the cave! This man was supposed to be dead; I saw him dead in there. I wasn’t sure what was wrong, but I knew that I had to get back to the cave. I couldn’t alert my family, I didn’t want to seem crazy, but I had to see if there was a body in that cave. I had to get Maggie now and head out there before dark.

I ran out of the restaurant and away from Eric as fast as I could. I grabbed the keys from the valet’s station and left a dollar on the counter. My mission was to get the dog and get to the cave before sundown, I still have my backpack sitting by the front door so I wouldn’t have to worry about packing. I had a little over an hour until sunset, I arrived home and quickly gathered my bag and Maggie. I could hear Jasmine asking me where I was going, but I didn’t have time to explain. “Oh, don’t worry babe I’ll be back soon.”

“How’d the meeting go? Did you bring me any take-out?” I could hear her voice growing closer, she was stepping toward the hallway from the kitchen.

“No sorry. I’ll tell you later, I’m in a hurry right now.” I swung the backpack over my shoulder. Jasmine had stepped into the breezeway between the hall and the kitchen, her petite frame silhouetted from the lamp resting on the counter behind her.

“No, you can’t leave now.” A viscous liquid dripped slowly off the sleeves of her see-through negligee.

“God damn babe, are you bleeding? Where’s Pennie?” I approached her with worried fervor.

“She’s here, Pennie’s home.” I reached halfway down the hallway where the light switch was sitting on my left, I flipped the switch, and my eyes watered from the news it had just received. Jasmine stood in the doorway from the kitchen still, the liquid was in fact blood, her blood. She was completely nude besides her pink negligee; a deep wound ran up from her bushy pubic hair through her engorged belly, finishing directly under her ribs.

Bart flanked Maggie and I from the living room on the right. He snarled and kept in a low-ready stance; foam was oozing out his mouth. The growling just caused it to roll and bubble further. Maggie dug into her own defensive posture and backed into me, I reached into my bag and yelled at Bart.

“Hey!”

Jasmine dug her hand into the wound without concern for pain, I shuddered, and bile shot out from my twisting stomach into my throat. I kept my mouth closed and swallowed the warm, sour goo. I could see she gripped something within herself. “Look.” She ripped her hand out of her seeping chasm, her handing holding a motionless Pennie.

“Jesus Christ! What have you done?” My left hand clenched into a fist and my entire body began to shake with rage. My right hand had gripped around the gun.

“You couldn’t accept the good life, but you can’t leave now. I’m keeping you home like Pennie.” Jasmine lunged toward me revealing a knife in her right hand, the baby still in her left. I front kicked my girlfriend in the chest as hard as I could, which sent her crashing into the wall and falling, but not before she was able to get a slash onto the back of my right calf.

Bart lunged at Maggie when Jasmine attacked, but the sudden adrenaline caused my trigger finger to squeeze and misfire the gun. Maggie was saved.

I rushed out of the house with Maggie shortly in tow, I locked my car doors and took a second to call the police and tell them about Jasmine and Pennie. I know running to the woods will make me the prime suspect, but maybe I could make things right still. I’m not entirely sure what the hell is going on, but I know I’ll find my answers at the cave.

I got to the trail head with thirty-seven minutes of sunlight, according to the weather app, and I had about that much time of walking to make up. I was still dressed in nice clothes suited for a business meeting with a sizable gash on my right leg, but I decided I was going to have to run for a little bit or else it would get dark about the same time I got to the cave.

The rain started as soon as I got close to where I was supposed to turn off toward the train tracks. I was still just as close to my car as the cave, this was the earliest it had ever rained when going to the cave. After much effort and ditching my blazer in the sand, I had finally reached the cave in the clearing. Everything looked the same as I remembered, everything except the sign, this time the sign looked as if it was freshly painted, and it read:

*2THESS211*

I still didn’t know what that could mean, but maybe I could research it once everything calms down a little. I approached the cave with caution, like I were approaching a wild animal, one step at a time. It stood breathing and staring through us. Maggie stuck close by me and matched my slow steps. We entered the cave, and the weather had calmed completely, the smell and low echo remained the same as I remember. Each step I took flashed more memories I had completely forgotten.

The memories of Jasmine and me. How our pregnancy was a disaster from the beginning, she came to me in a time of need as the one person she trusted, and I told her I wanted an abortion. I remembered how we separated for a few days until I came back with my tail between my legs, begging for forgiveness.

When we first started dating, she told me how she likely would never get pregnant, me being young and dumb, I thought this was great. I had no interest in having a family back then. She seemed fine with not having a family either, so when she came to me with this news, I saw the pregnancy as a nuisance getting in the way of our plans to travel and establish a relationship through experience. I now know she saw the pregnancy as nothing short of a miracle. She was told by doctors her whole life she wouldn’t bear a child, and while she was content with her reality at that time, she wanted nothing more than for that one in a million marvel to happen.

I was selfish and I was lucky she gave me a second chance, but I took it too far and did a complete turnaround. It probably fucked with her head how excited I became, when it was just a few weeks ago that I had asked for the abortion. Eventually the stress I put her under led to a miscarriage. The relationship didn’t last too long after that, we couldn’t keep up the act and she essentially hated me. Can’t say I blame her, but it didn’t and still doesn’t make it feel any better.

Maggie and Bart were the consolation prize for a miscarriage and an ill-placed bandage made to render lifesaving aid to the quickly dying relationship. When we split, I got Maggie and she took Bart, then we both moved away from our hometown. I only moved back when I couldn’t find work, so I ended up staying in my vacant childhood home and started working as a teacher, trying to write stories and fill the void that the past year left behind. This took me all the way to the walks with Maggie and finding this cave. My mind was caught up. I pushed through the invisible threshold the same as I did last time.

\*\*\*

My eyes snapped open, the cave was clear in my vision, a flashlight was sitting on the floor shining its light onto the body at my feet, Eric’s body. When I looked down, I noticed I was dressed in my shorts and raincoat from the day before, no button up or wingtips. My mouth was extremely dry, I reached for my phone and pulled it out. The date on my phone was Saturday. Have I been standing here for an entire day? I retrieved my water bottle and gulped until I was satisfied, then I pulled the dog bowl out and gave Maggie some water. She stood beside me panting, she was back too.

After I felt like I was back in my own body, I decided to call in Eric. I dialed the nonemergency services and told them as much about the situation as I could without sounding crazy. Two officers arrived at the scene in about twenty minutes, pretty quick considering where we were at. They were Deputies Mullen and Weiber, both arriving in a Volusia County Sherriff’s office F-250 super duty, I guess they wanted a four-wheel drive vehicle to save on the walking. Deputy Mullen hopped out of the driver seat and was immediately an imposing figure, he had a scowl resting on his face and it was obvious he didn’t want to take this call, especially now that it was raining again. Deputy Weiber was a younger, mousey man who carried a smile which read that this was his first body.

Mullen slammed the truck door shut and hopped into the sugar sand below, he flipped his chrome Oakley’s onto his head where they sat resting in a forest of gelled spikes. The deputy then pointed at me with his left hand. Revealing his rubber, back the blue wedding ring. “You make the call?”

“Yeah, I found a body in the cave back there. I think his name’s Eric.” I said, adjusting my posture in place. My back is sore, I think I really did stand in place for over a day.

“That the name of the missing guy, Joe?” Deputy Mullen asked.

“I think so, but a cave?” Deputy Weiber questioned while pulling up his ill-fitting gun belt. “You ever heard of a cave around here, Nick?”

“No… don’t think I have.” Deputy Mullen replied, “Well, show us the way then, sir?”

“Kenny. It’s not very far, just through these woods.” I turned and started walking back toward the entrance with the dog again, the two officers followed. When we reached the clearing both were surprised to see there was a cave like this in central Florida, I wasn’t the only one who was fascinated.

Deputy Mullen was the officer in charge, because he broke down what we were going to do. Deputy Weiber was going to take my statement out here while Deputy Mullen went in the cave to find the body. I told them both that going into the cave alone was probably dangerous, and I tried to explain my situation the best I could, but all it sounded like to them was that I hadn’t reported a body for at least a full day. I dropped the topic to save my own skin. This situation was hardly believable to me, and I was the person who had just lived it, so I think there was no use trying to convince them of anything. They were just going to have to experience it themselves.

Deputy Mullen stepped into the cave with a blasé attitude that exuded ill-place confidence. I felt bad for the guy, but he didn’t want to listen and once he disappeared into the darkness there was hardly a thing I could do. I wasn’t going back in.

I gave Deputy Weiber my complete story from the very first encounter. It wasn’t until I explained the impossibilities of my child Pennie being born, the clothes I’m wearing not matching, and the rest that he decided to check his watch and saw that over thirty minutes had passed without a word from his partner. A pale sickness had stolen the color from his face, the officer turned to the entrance and stood just outside.

“Nick!” Deputy Weiber leaned against the rock tunnel with his left hand, screaming into the abyss. “Nick! Can you hear me?” The officer turned back toward me and looked into my eyes hoping for an answer, but I could only shrug. He shifted his eyes to the ground below him, shuffling into the cave a half step at a time and bending slightly at his knees to avoid bumping his head. Weiber kept calling out for his partner without any response, soon he wasn’t visible from outside the cave, but I could still hear his yelling echo back out of the chamber. “Nick! C’mon man, did you find the body so we can go?” A moment of silence, “What’re you doing?” The click of a flashlight rings, “Are you?” A rustling came from inside the cave, followed by quick, heavy steps. Deputy Weiber bursts out from the cave entrance, dragging his much bigger friend by the collar of his ballistic vest.

“Shit! What happened?”

“I’m not sure, he’s unresponsive.” Deputy Weiber pulled out his radio and pressed a red button, then called in for EMS services, “Just keep pressing his chest.”

“Okay.” I pumped on the officer’s chest, trying to remember Bee Gees song off the top of my head.

“I’ll get someone to take you home too.”

“Thanks.”

“No problem, just keep pumping until I can take over.” Deputy Weiber called in everyone he could. Eventually, he took over the CPR and when the ambulance came, they loaded Deputy Mullen into the back. I looked through the bars and glass of a squad cruiser, Deputy Weiber’s eyes lit up for a moment before the paramedic on site shook his head and drove off. I was driven home by another officer. I kept quiet during the ride home.

“What happened back there?” The officer asked, glancing at me with curious eyes through the rearview mirror.

“I don’t know man; I just need to sleep.” I replied, drowsiness in my voice. I think he got the hint because he switched to just asking about the directions to my house. Once we arrived, I thanked him like an obliged catapult, then I slinked into my house, flipping on the lights. Maggie was just as tired as I. We both sunk into our beds and crashed asleep before our evening rituals.

\*\*\*

Sleep was a welcome break from the tiresome illusion that plagued my life for a day and a half. I awoke and continued my morning as normal, coffee, exercise, and the like. At this point, my experience from the past day felt nothing more than a distant dream, except for one part. My daughter’s face. I couldn’t have the image escape my mind. I had never seen her face before and while it was just the construction of whatever the hell I experienced, it felt real.

I kept chugging through my existence, always half-expecting a phone call to come in and tell me I have a warrant to serve. I was able to take Maggie on a walk; albeit, to a different park a little further away. I also was able to get some writing done and map out the ending to my story.

It was nearly ten o’clock at night when the suited men knocked at my door. There was four of them; two in black suits with Glocks half-concealed in their belt line, a scientist dressed in hiking boots, a dry-fit polo, and khakis with a wrinkled, fresh lab coat draped atop. Lastly was a priest dressed in the usual Catholic garb, but he was wearing a Yankees hat, that I found misplaced.

They kept me up for eleven more hours, asking me details about the events that transpired over the past four days. I told them all I knew, but they didn’t reciprocate with any answers. I got the hint that they’ve been chasing this cave around for a while. The scientist off-handedly mentioned that our town, “Had more to do than the last two spots.” He was reprimanded for speaking around me.

The four of them exited once they were satisfied; the scientist looked at me with worried eyes, but the priest patted me on the shoulder. He turned to me before exiting and said, “Two eleven.”

“Sorry what?” I ask, one hand on the doorknob.

“A grand delusion, that’s all it was son. If you’re curious, stay away from caves. The Bible always has answers for you, my boy.”

# HABIT BUILDING

The game changer for me was reading ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear. This book will make you question everything you think you know about building habits. Clear breaks down the science of why we fail and gives you a bulletproof system that actually works.

The biggest mistake I made at first was relying on motivation. I'd get hyped up, promise myself I'd read for 2 hours daily, then crash and burn after 3 days. Motivation is like weather, it comes and goes. You can't build your life on something that unstable.

The solution is willpower plus stupidly small requirements. Instead of ""I'll read 50 pages because I'm motivated,"" say ""I'll force myself to read 1 page because I have enough willpower for that."" Make it so small you can't fail.

Here's the psychology behind why this works. Once you sit down with the book and read that one page, you'll usually keep going. Your brain doesn't want to stop once it's started. But if you set a huge goal and feel overwhelmed, you won't even start.

Try it right now. Go grab any book and read one page. I guarantee you have the willpower for that.

# READING

This is where the magic happened for me. Reading non-fiction daily was the one habit that changed everything else. I got an e-reader and started carrying it everywhere. Public transport, waiting in lines, before bed, it became my default activity.

The benefits hit different when you experience them yourself. You're learning directly from the smartest people who ever lived. Einstein, Marcus Aurelius, Maya Angelou, they're all waiting on your bookshelf. There are books on literally anything you find interesting.

But here's what most people don't realize about reading. It rewires your brain. When you read, you create new neural pathways. You're upgrading your mental operating system every single day. After six months of consistent reading, I feel like I have access to hundreds of brilliant minds.

Books that completely changed my perspective: ""The Willpower Instinct"" by Kelly McGonigal (Stanford psychologist who breaks down the science of self-control), ""Flow"" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (the psychology of optimal experience), and ""Meet Your Happy Chemicals"" by Loretta Breuning (how your brain chemicals actually work).

I've tried everything to make reading more accessible and addictive. Physical books are great but since I got my new job in banking I seldom have time to read full books. My friend put me onto a smart reading tool called BeFreed that turns books into engaging and personalized podcasts. It lets you pick how deep you want to go, 10/20 min summaries, or full 40-min deep dives. You can customize your own reading host’s voice & tone (mine has a smoky voice like Samantha). It also builds a learning roadmap for you based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I use it to crush books on discipline, psychology, and even investing, while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I’d be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I’ve replaced TikTok with knowledge. Essential sources for any lifelong learner. 

I also use Fable to track my reading, discover new books, and stay motivated through the community. For me, the goal is to remove every barrier to consuming knowledge.

The compound effect is insane. Knowledge builds on knowledge. Concepts from one book connect to ideas in another. You start seeing patterns everywhere. Your conversations get deeper. Your problem-solving improves. Friends notice you're giving better advice.

# DOPAMINE AND BRAIN CHEMISTRY

This part blew my mind when I learned about it. Most people think dopamine equals pleasure, but that's wrong. Dopamine is actually about wanting and motivation. It's what drives you to seek rewards.

Here's the problem. Social media, Netflix, junk food, they all give massive dopamine hits. Way more than anything in nature ever would. Your brain gets addicted to these super-stimuli. When you're constantly getting these artificial highs, normal activities feel boring.

Reading trains your brain to focus on one thing for extended periods. It's like meditation but you're also gaining knowledge. You're teaching your dopamine system to find satisfaction in learning and growth instead of mindless consumption.

After a few weeks of consistent reading, I noticed my attention span improving. I could focus longer on tasks. The constant need to check my phone decreased. Reading became my replacement for doom scrolling.

# FLOW STATES

One book that changed how I think about activities is ""Flow"" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow is when you're completely absorbed in an activity. You lose track of time. You forget about yourself. You're just present with the task.

Reading creates natural flow states. When you're deep in a good book, hours feel like minutes. This is your brain operating at peak performance. You're not distracted or scattered. You're fully engaged.

The difference between pleasure and enjoyment hit me hard. Pleasure activities give you dopamine but don't make you grow. Scrolling TikTok is pleasurable but empty. Reading is enjoyable because it challenges you and makes you better.

I started filling my days with more flow activities. Reading, learning guitar, having deep conversations. These activities are harder than passive entertainment but infinitely more rewarding.

# PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION

Start tonight with one page. Any book that interests you. Self-help, fiction, biography, doesn't matter. The goal is building the habit first.

Keep a book or e-reader visible somewhere you'll see it daily. I put mine next to my coffee maker so I'd see it every morning.

Replace one mindless activity with reading. Instead of scrolling while you eat breakfast, read. Instead of watching random YouTube videos before bed, read.

Track your progress somehow. I use a simple habit tracker tool. Seeing the streak build up becomes addictive.

Join online communities about reading. Reddit has amazing book communities. Goodreads helps you discover new books and track what you've read.

The crazy part is that six months ago, I thought people who read regularly were just naturally disciplined. Now I realize discipline is just a habit you build one page at a time. Reading taught me that I'm not broken or lazy. I just needed better systems and knowledge about how my brain actually works.

Anyone can do this. You don't need special talent or motivation. You just need to start ridiculously small and be consistent. Your future self will thank you for starting today.",1,1754358268.0,NonZeroDay,0,1.0,False

1mhwa9x,https://i.redd.it/de8a9seft3hf1.jpeg,Domestic bliss with Kaidan,"Picture it. Just a blissful domestic life with Mr. Kaidan Alenko. Mundane in all the best possible ways. Having some coffee and chatting for a bit before you both head out to work. Maybe talk about your busy schedules for the day, what to have for dinner that night, maybe weekend plans. You give him a big hug and inhale his fresh cologne that probably smells like the ocean (because of course he smells good) and he gives you a sweet kiss before heading out the door. To the outside world, he's this badass Alliance Major and Spectre. But at home, he's just Kaidan, your sweet and loving partner/husband. 

  
Ugh, okay, I better stop daydreaming before I burn my actual dinner.
