1iigl7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1iigl7r/husband_concerns_me/,Husband concerns me,"Baby boy is 1 month and 1 day today :)

Here’s my spiel. It’s sort of a rant, but it’s also a genuine question.

TLDR: husband says some sus things about handling our fussy baby and has slightly escalated annoyed behavior. What do I do about this? Therapy?

I’m not sure what to do. 
My husband and I just had our first baby. Husband was great before baby being born. I was taken care of and felt like we were doing okay as a couple. I usually do everything household chore wise, and I have for the last five years. But since being pregnant, he took on more household responsibility, but he doesn’t work or do anything really except get on discord and play games with friends… so it seemed fair. At the time I was working full time and going to school in person about 25 hours a week not including homework. I am studying to be a surgical technologist. I will be done with the program within a year.
Now, my baby is a month old. However this past month has been hell. One because of having our life turned upside down by our (awesome) new addition.
My husband used to be infantry in the Army and I just knew he’d have no issues staying up late or functioning under stress.
However I pegged him completely wrong.
As soon as we got home from the hospital you would’ve thought he was the one who gave birth. He slept for 12+ hours and complained how badly he hurt and was sore and didn’t touch the first dish or laundry pile or diaper. Which, everyone told me to let the house go and just focus on baby for the first couple of weeks while we get our bearings.
So I didn’t mind, but I did need help with handling a baby! I would ask, hey can you take him while I shower, etc. and he would take baby boy but just stand next to me while I did whatever task I wanted to do and as soon as it was complete he would be shoving our son back into my arms. I was in the shower and he stood outside of it with my screaming son.
I pull exclusively due to a horrible latch for the first week and my nipples were too torn up to try latching and now my baby is used to bottles. But every time I go to pump I swear my baby knows and pitches a fit so I’ve asked my husband to hold him while I pump. Only for 20 minutes. That’s all he has to do. Thats it.
So here’s the concerning part: 
Like all babies my son cries. He just got over some gassy spell which he would scream and cry during. My husband said while holding him the second week, “I can understand why people shake their babies.”This made me nervous as I do not feel that way I can’t even relate to it. (This is not a judgement to anyone else. I get it. I’m at the end of my rope as well, but I personally just haven’t felt that feeling).
Then the next day I requested a nap and for my husband to watch him for only 3 hours. I woke up with my bedroom door shut and my son’s room is across the house and his door was shut. I heard my son screaming and crying like I hadn’t heard before. I got out the bed super fast and ran for my son. My husband was just standing in the kitchen drinking coffee. I busted open my son’s room and he was red he was crying so hard. At only two weeks old.
I grabbed him and the second he touched me he stopped crying.
Another night last week, my son was on the floor with my husband doing tummy time and I was pumping and my son got really upset and starting crying and my husband leaned toward him and said, “that kind of cry is how you get punched in the face.” I looked at him really sharp and told him not to ever say that joking or not.
Then the last instance happened just yesterday. I was again pumping and all he had to do was hold the baby. I had been up with him all night and let my husband sleep in the bed unbothered all night. I got my husband up out of the bed and he immediately starting complaining that he’s exhausted. Never mind how long I’ve been up and hadn’t showered for.
I wanted to go off, but I simply said “okay just hold him for twenty minutes while I pump.”
He was so mad that he had to get up. Well Caleb starting crying of course and my husband laid back with him on the couch so they were stomach to stomach. Caleb kept crying instead of settling and I could tell my husband was agitated more and more. Then finally I wasn’t looking and I heard a real loud smack noise. I thought he hit my son so I got up super fast and grabbed my son, who was scared to death (he’s a month old as of yesterday) and starting crawling up my husbands chest away from him and got his face stuck down in a pillow within those three seconds it took for me to cross the room.
Well it turns out he didn’t smack him but he clapped his hands together super hard and angrily, like clasped them together loudly over my baby’s head.
My heart was racing and my adrenaline and fight or flight was activated 100%. I was so angry and sad and shocked and sick. The only thing my husband has said about it was, I didn’t hurt him. I refuse to talk to him. I’m so mad at him I feel like I hate him. But I don’t know what to do about this. I don’t know what his issue is… we’ve never been a perfect couple but I’ve never felt this way about him. My son is my whole world and beyond that he’s a helpless infant. I would die if anything happened to him.

What do I do? Therapy? Alone or together??
I’m scared to leave my baby with him.

He’s got an extensive background in coffee/hospitality/mgmt so I know he’s super capable and it makes me sad to see him like this. His self confidence has for sure taken a beating. 

He got put into a store where the SM there went to do some training to potentially become a DM, not sure how that all works, but there was always a possibility that she could come back and take the store back and he’d be placed in another store, so he was apprehensive about making too make changes. Now it’s almost certain he’s staying at this store. The team really loves him and has voiced that they hope he stays vs having the old SM return. 

Anyway, I know nothing about that business and I feel useless cause I want to offer him advice and solutions when he’s having a rough time. 

There seems to always be some beef between partners or supervisors that he’s got the mediate, and callouts happening all the damn time so he’s working like 50+hr weeks to compensate. 

Even today is supposed to be his day off but he’s catching up on some online trainings and responding to messages and such. 

His DM seems to be decent from what he tells me. 
It’s a different one than the one that hired him and it’s been acknowledged that when he was started working it wasn’t handled properly/they didn’t have everything prepared for him to be set up for success. Plus he took over his store right at the beginning of the holidays so it was an extra stressful and busy time. 

Anyway, any advice in how I can best support him or be helpful would be cool. ",1,1738779123.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

1iigjzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1iigjzr/cavity_galore/,Cavity galore,"So I had a dentist appointment, and yet again I came away with a cavity. A small pit they said, but nonetheless disappointment because I genuinely do try to keep up with my oral hygiene.

I've always been the one in the family who gets cavities. Funny enough my sibling, who hasn't been to the dentist in years and doesn't take amazingly good care of her teeth, hasn't had a single cavity...she also loves her juice.)

Do you guys have advice for what I could be doing differently? I enjoy sweets, but I'm trying (especially now) to be more balanced in terms of what I eat. I drink literally gallons of water a day, so I think I'm good in that department. I brush, floss, and I've even been using a prescription grade toothpaste they gave me.

Since my early childhood when I didn't care at all for my teeth, I've actually been on a clean streak in terms of no cavities. In more recent years, they've been more consistent however. Like it feels every year or two a new one appears. My dentist mentioned that these areas have been weakening over time, so it's not just out of the blue.

Nonetheless, I don't think genetics are on my side here. I'm going to start making some changes to my routine. I'm gonna start using MI paste again on a daily basis at night, to hopefully help with re-mineralizing those weakened areas.

The only thing I can really think of, are my brushing patterns. I usually get up, skip out on breakfast until lunch, although I do have my coffee. (diluted with milk, so it's not as acidic.) This is something I've been confused about. Like, do I brush before coffee, after my first meal (which in my case is usually lunch not breakfast) or both? I also feel like one mistake I've been making is not brushing my teeth soon enough after a meal. Like, I get you're supposed to wait an hour or so before you brush, but I think I've been waiting a bit too long to do so. I stay up late, so my bedtime is usually late in the early morning. So I have dinner, and usually do my oral routine right before I go to bed. I feel this could be a red flag as well.

Sorry for the long post. Just wondered if you guys could offer any advice to some one like myself who worries over this kind of stuff (like my teeth are rapidly decaying beyond control.)

1iigjhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/1iigjhg/got_paid_to_do_drugs/,Got paid to do drugs.,"My hands are still shaking right now...

Here's what happened.

A week ago, I entered a contract with a client running affiliate ads for a real gosh-darn popular brand of ‘focus’ gum...meaning caffeine and whatnot.

My task?

Research—no writing involved whatsoever.

Now, forget all that “market research” stuff you’ve heard about. That’s boring.

Today we’re here to chew caffeine gum and kick ass. Introducing…

# How to Run Product Research for Fun & Profit

***Caveat: This is geared towards freelancers, copywriters and small agencies. We aren't running massive focus groups to test different flavors of Coke for multi-billion dollar corporations, OK?***

First of all, what is the POINT of product research? Why are we doing this in the first place? Just so I can bill my client extra moolah for a month’s supply of peppermint-blast caffeine taurine focus gum with a cool, FREE travel tin that has a badass stingray on the side?

…

NO!

That’s what we in the marketing world call a free ‘bonus.’

Anyway.

The real point of product research is to “become the market,” as we’ve heard a thousand times from every marketing guru under the sun…

And well, you don’t get any more “market” than ordering, receiving, using, and reviewing an actual, honest-to-goodness hold-it-in-your-hands physical product.

Below you’ll find my REAL “clinical trial” that I sent my client (part of a package with wider market research).

Names **REDACTED** for privacy, of course.

# My 7-Day Clinical Trial

I’m a pretty heavy coffee-drinker—about 400 mg of caffeine per day, which is about 10 pieces of **REDACTED** gum. My goal over the next week is to phase out ALL of my coffee intake and replace it with gum. I’ll report any findings below.

# Day 1

* Replaced 40 ml of coffee with one piece of gum
* All caffeine consumed before noon
* Initial remarks on the gum:
   * Taste is absolutely horrible…there’s a blast of peppermint flavor and obvious sorbitol / fake sugary-ness. The peppermint flavor vanishes after a couple seconds, replaced by nasty bitterness/medicinal notes. For a few minutes, all you can taste are the caffeine and fake sugar. By 5-10 minutes, you’re left with a faint breeze of peppermint, but it’s at least tolerable.
   * The texture is super weird. First bite, you crunch right through the gum—it’s crumbly, hard and brittle. At first, I thought I made a mistake and ordered the mints by accident. After a minute or so, the texture transforms into gum and the pieces consolidate…overall, very weird.
   * A lot of these energy/focus gums have complaints about the gum turning into a “wet paper” consistency after chewing, but I didn’t have this issue (only chewed it for 30 minutes). I’ll go for an hour tomorrow…
* On packaging—**REDACTED** shipped the paper packs all jumbled up in a plastic shipping bag with no padding. The boxes were a bit crushed on arrival, which isn’t a great look. They also came with a metal tin as a bonus, but it’s pretty flimsy…as far as bonuses go, it’s flimsy enough that I feel it detracts from the experience.
* **REDACTED** has great packaging design. The gum packs look modern and clean, almost like supplements instead of gum. But they’d look better if they didn’t ride all the way from **REDACTED** to Maryland with somebody’s blender sitting on top of them.

# Day 2

* Replaced 120 ml of coffee with 3 pieces of gum
* Still not used to the flavor
* Nothing remarkable to report

# Day 3

* Replaced my entire first cup of coffee (around 7 am) with 5 pieces of gum
* Chewed all 5 at the same time, to see if there’s any difference in energy levels, as per **REDACTED’s** website
* No notable difference

# Day 4

* Replaced first cup, same as yesterday, with 5 pieces of gum
* Replaced most of second cup with 3 pieces of gum
* Had a really small cup of coffee around noon
* Actually felt MORE jittery today than when I just drink coffee

# Day 5

* Replaced all coffee with gum
* All gum before noon
* Same jitteriness as yesterday
* Still tastes bad…more tolerable

# Day 6

* Had a “cup” of gum (5 pieces) first thing in the morning
* Spread the remaining 5 pieces of gum out all the way up until 3 pm, way later than I normally drink coffee
* Felt WIRED, couldn’t sleep

# Day 7

* Spaced gum evenly throughout the day, all the way up until 5 pm
* Felt wired again, couldn’t sleep

# Final Notes

* While I definitely don’t LIKE the taste, it wasn’t nearly as bad by Day 7.
* The texture is still super weird…hard to crumbly to gum…just a strange experience.
* I didn’t notice any focus “enhancements” while working. Same as drinking coffee, except less fun.
* One of the use cases I thought would be useful is if you’re crashing in the late afternoon but don’t want to drink a cup of coffee…but it was still hard to sleep after chewing the gum.
* I do see how this gum would be appealing if you’re traveling and just need a quick shot of energy.

Overall, I don’t like it. But I can see how it’d appeal to its target market, and on the plus side, it does seem to avoid the pitfalls of most of its competitors.

# What to Look for and Record During Product Research

When you’re deep in the trenches of product research, chewing gum like it’s your job (because, well, it *is*), you need to track more than just *whether you like it or not*. 

Your opinion doesn’t matter.

Here’s what to document:

# 1. First Impressions & Packaging

* How does the product arrive? Is it well-packaged? Or does the box look like it fell out of the back of a dirty pickup truck and got attacked by geese?
* Does the design *look* premium, cheap, or forgettable?
* Are there unexpected *bonuses* included? Do they add value or just feel like junk?

# 2. Taste, Feel, and Experience (If Applicable)

* If it’s a consumable, how does it taste/smell/feel?
* If it’s a physical product, is it intuitive to use, or does it need an instruction manual written in hieroglyphics?
* If it’s a digital/info product, does the experience feel cohesive?

# 3. Usability & Performance

* Does the product *do* what it claims?
* How does it perform over time? (Not just 5 minutes in—does it hold up after a week?)

# 4. Comparison Against Alternatives

* How does it stack up against similar products?
* Is it better, worse, or just a carbon copy of something else?
* What’s *missing* that competitors offer?

# 5. Common Complaints & Issues

* What do real customers hate about it (from reviews, forums, Reddit deep dives)?
* Does it solve a *real* problem, or is it just another shiny object?
* Are there quick fixes that would improve the product instantly?

# 6. Unexpected Insights

* The stuff you wouldn’t have noticed if you just Googled it.
* Something you felt or experienced that might be a *huge* selling point nobody’s talking about.
* Any *weird* use cases or alternative benefits?

Open thine eyes beyond casual consumption—remember, you’re a marketer. Do marketing.

# Key Takeaway?

You can see a couple *pretty valuable* sales angles nestled lovingly in those notes up there—angles you might miss doing ONLY market research.

Can you spot them?

Yes…you there, in the back.

Bingo! The most valuable nugget above is **REDACTED.**

(OK, seriously. Can you spot the huge insight I got that I would NOT have found just doing market research? It’s right there.)

Keep looking.

My heart rate today has overall been 10bpm on average lower than usual (my resting heart rate usually is already pretty low, 50-60). 

I’m just confused why this happens because I thought coffee increases your heart rate and blood pressure?

But like today, my heart rate was very slow (a bit concerning) and I overall felt like my heart was taking it too chill… 

Why is this? Does anyone else have this? Is this something to be concerned about? And can I continue drinking coffee and maybe and surpass this? I do really like the taste of coffee and having something that does keep me alert…

Funnily enough the reason why I've recently gotten back into them is because I am currently learning French and I needed some interesting/fun reading material, and I suddenly remembered them and how entertaining/terrifying they were back then.

I figured that, if they were still a thing, they definitely would be different to a degree from what I remembered, but I wasn't really expecting what I found. The SCPs I remember from highschool were stuff like the murderous Statue, Shy Guy, hard to kill reptile, magic coffee machine, haunted cowbell, magic Ronald Reagan snuff tape etc. Stuff that obviously is fantastical but also still kind of grounded I guess. When I started reading/listening to some of the newer ones, so many of them are these calamitous, god-like, esoteric beings with heavy religious implications (if not just being outright demonic).

It just feels off to me, like it's harder to buy into and suspend disbelief when the SCP foundation is literally containing Satan and Cthulu and actual demons/angels or God-like E.T.s with malicious intent for some reason, rather than just weird, anomalous creatures that could potentially cause panic/death if they got out or were made public. It just feels like it's a completely different genre of fiction now, like it went full-in on cosmic horror and weird-fiction rather than the more grounded entries I remember reading.",4,1738778461.0,SCP,1,0.83,False
1iiga1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1iiga1s/my_experience_during_storm_eowyn_and_having_no/,"my experience during Storm Eowyn and having no electricity, cell service or internet","***Sorry in advance for this very long post.*** 



Storm Eowyn hit Ireland the night of the 24th February and I’m so glad that I began prepping.  I didn't have power, cell service or internet for 4/5 days.. Some people still don't have electricity 13 days later. Broadband didn't come back to my area for over 10 days and it still isn’t available everywhere. This is my experience. I’ve made it in bullet points hoping it is easier to read. 



It was a red weather warning with wind and gusts over 114 mph in some places. It was the worst storm recorded in Ireland.  I have never heard or felt winds like it before.  There was and is so much damage after the storm. I learned so much from this storm and I've put my thoughts below about what worked and didn't work. 

*Pre-Storm*

* I had my water in… I had lots of bottled water plus I had my berkey water filled up and that holds 8 liters of water. I had around 5 or 6 empty 5 liter bottles of water filled up too.
* I did all the laundry the day before the storm hit and the house was cleaned. 
* I walked around the house and garden to make sure that everything was put away. I also took a video of the house including the roof and windows etc for insurance in case there was any damage. 
* I showered and cooked meals for the following day
* I went grocery shopping and got bread, cheese, cold cuts, extra dog food etc. I know people say why are you buying bread before the storm but the reality is when you're in the middle of the storm and you don't want to cook (or can't) a sandwich is something you can make without thinking  too much about and it is filling. 
* I had all my electronics charged and my prep supplies out on the kitchen table.. Candles, torches, lighters, batteries, gas camping stove plus gas canisters, hurricane oil lamp and oil, battery bank charger for my phones, large solar lights (they are for outdoors and have 3 lights on them and are super bright), wind up radio and battery operated radio, wind up clock. Plus lots of other things.
* I have a propane gas heater that is portable and I had a full tank of propane (got that during the week before the storm hit) 



In the middle of the night, the electric went but it was okay, or so I thought. When I got up in the morning and walked around the house, I noticed that part of the metal on my shed roof was missing and the fascia on my water pump house was off.. I checked the roof of my house and it was okay so I was able to breathe.. Shed roof is an easy fix!! My neighbours across the road had lost slates on their roof. My friend also lost slates on her roof.



*During the storm and day after:-*



* I am so glad that I had the battery operated radio because the internet and cell service went down, so with the radio I was able to hear what was going on.
* I had lots of books to read, cards to play with and crafts to do that kept me busy and entertained.  I read a lot to pass the time and it was actually nice having a digital detox (even if it was forced!)
* My friend drove up to my house and said that there was a gas station near us that had a generator and internet and drove there. It was so packed…everyone had the same idea.  There was no internet and they were only taking cash. No atms or card machines were working and made you realise that cash is king in these situations. I had 200 euro cash in my safe so we had cash. We managed to get a cuppa coffee, a burger (never tasted so good!!!) and fries.  It took over an hour to get the order but we didn't mind…We were able to charge our phones in her car.. They weren't low like 80% but good to get them fully charged again and plug in the battery bank to make sure that was still fully charged.  
* It snowed the first night with no electricity!!  But I had the propane heater so I was able to take that down to my bedroom and have my room warm when I went to bed. I also had a hot water bottle in my bed and I slept with extra layers on and extra blankets so I was nice and warm. 
* Gas camping stove was great.. I have a flask that I filled with hot water for coffee so I was able to keep warm. I had soup in the fridge that I was able to heat up.. I had gotten some fresh soups, thinking the electricity would be back in a few hours..(wishful thinking!) I had lots of food that was shelf stable like pasta rice gnocchi tinned vegetables, sauces, packed soups etc. So food wise I wasn't worried.
* I stayed in my kitchen during the day as it's comfortable and I have a nice big sofa in there to chill.  Using the propane heater kept the room warm, (it wasn’t on all the time)and when I was cooking on the gas camping stove that gave off extra heat. 
* I made sure to move and walk.. Sitting down made me feel the cold and as soon as I was up doing anything, I felt warmer.. .. I went out in my garden with my puppy on a lead.. I live on an acre so it was a safe space to walk around.  Trees and electricity lines were down everywhere so it wasn’t safe to walk on the roads.  
* I made sure that all curtains in the house were closed to keep any heat in. 
* I had thermals and they made such a difference! 



My electricity came back after 4 days and cell service wasn’t back for nearly a week! My internet provider was half working… if I was standing in a certain spot in my kitchen. It was very hit and miss.   

* Everything in my freezer and fridge had to be dumped! 
* My friend's electricity didn’t come back for a week so as soon as I got electricity she came up with all their electronic devices and charged them all up.
* She was also able to get laundry done here and all of her family were able to shower here. 
* Her adult children  were able to use my phone as a hotspot and use their phones.  The connection wasn’t strong enough to use for a laptop.  
* I had lots of long-life milk (I have seen videos online of people buying it in Dollar tree in America) . I was able to give some to my friend for her house so they had milk for tea, coffee , breakfast etc.  It was cold out so I just put it in a plastic box with a lid and left it out overnight and it was fine.  



Community



The community here all stood up and helped everyone…We were all in it together. Community got together before the government. 

* Farmers checking trees and cutting them down, when safe to do so, helping to clear roads.  They were also taking supplies to people who were stuck down side roads with no way out. 
* Our local butcher has a BBQ trailer that he uses for functions. He took it out to the square in our town and cooked meals for everyone, pay what you can.  
* Local community centers that had generators set up hubs where you could go to get warm and for a hot cup of coffee tea, charge your devices. Some places had showers available. 
* Hotels in the country opened up their board rooms for people who needed to work.. For free!  Even gave free tea coffee biscuits.  
* There were hubs set up in towns around the country with pods where you could go for a shower, hot water for tea coffee etc and a place to charge your phone… and if they had wifi you could use it.  
* As much as I don't like using Facebook, it was amazing when the internet came back.  I was able to check the local community facebook groups and see what was going on.  They put so much information up for people in one place, like when and where the water tankers were going to be in town for people to get water. What places had opened for showers, where you get hot meals etc. 
* Our local politicians, the ones who do so much for the community, were great and you could see who was there for helping the community and who were in the job for themselves only!!  We had one ex-local politician who lost his seat in the last election and the person who got his seat.  The ex-local politician stood up and took charge. He was on Facebook doing videos, telling people the information that we needed, giving phone numbers for state agencies. Telling people to ring or text him if they needed anything and he was putting people in touch with each other.. Helping the community. It didn't matter to him that he wasn’t employed by the government anymore, he stood up and helped our/his community.  The guy who was elected.. He did the odd post and was on the radio saying how hard it was to get a signal to get information and he was “trying” but trying and doing are two different things and the ex-politician will be back in his seat at the next election. 



Government



* We all give out about our governments, it's natural and ours didn’t stand up and help at the beginning, maybe if it had hit the capital more they would have. They did after a few days ask Europe for help and crews from other countries came to help get the electricity back.
* It was local people and local communities that have and still are helping out.  The one thing our government did was set up a Humanitarian assistance scheme that everyone can apply for.  It's an emergency support payment to help pay for food, clothing, personal items and alternative accommodation if you need it. Then there is part two if you need help to get your house repaired… Some insurance companies are saying it's an act of god so you aren't covered.  



What I learned:

  


* I had enough supplies in to keep me comfortable and I didnt feel like I was in a panic or worried. I had food, water, heat and friends around me. 
* Community is everything.. Everyone helped everyone when this storm hit and it makes you realise that having a community around you is key to surviving and thriving.  
* Cash is King in this digital society. When everything goes down and you are back to basics, if you don't have cash, you can’t buy anything. I’m going to start to up the amount of cash I have in my safety deposit box at home. 
* When the internet goes down and you don't have the ability to look up a phone number or search for information, it’s quite scary.. I had no idea when my electricity was going to come back.. I was able to listen to the news on the radio and knew it was going to be days but I didn't have a phone number to ring to ask (also didn't have any cell service to ring them!) I have begun to write out in a book, all important phone numbers that I need plus all my family and friends numbers. I'm no longer relying on everything being on my phone!
* I spend too much time online!!
* I need to get my chimney cleaned and be able to use that as a heat source.
* I was going to change my electric stove to a gas one, but I think I will buy a wood stove instead, that way I can cook and get heat at the same time. 
* Invest in a generator. I hope this is the only big storm we have, but equally I doubt it.. We have had two big storms since December.. In December I lost my electricity for about 18 hours. I need to save for one, but I will. They are all sold out right now and any that are available are nearly double the price they were… Give it time and they will go back to normal prices. 
* Having bottled water was so worth it.. People were queuing up to buy water and it was gone as soon as it hit the shelves and there was a 4 bottle limit per person. 
* Gas camping stove was like gold.. People were searching to buy them and the gas canisters everywhere.  
* Battery radio was amazing.. Just to be able to know what was going on and for background noise. 
* I think I will buy a bicycle.  Some gas stations ran out of gas, so having a bicycle would be a good investment.  
* There is meant to be a spring somewhere near my house that just bubbles up from the ground. I’m going to find where it is.  There is also an old manual water pump around 1 mile from my house that people were using. I didn’t need to use it as I had enough water in but it's handy to know it's there. 
* Buy more tarps.. You can never have enough.. It was great to be able to put one on the shed roof and tie it down till I get it fixed. 
* That I’m extremely blessed that my electricity is back. When I check the power app for the country and see that people who live less than 5 minutes from me are still without electricity and it won’t be back for maybe another week.

I’m full time but my shifts are 30 minutes longer since lunch is unpaid. Usually I have to work a few hours on weekends or get a family obligation. I know that’s not so busy in comparison to other people or even myself in the past. Still, 40 hours is still enough to make me want more free time. 

I know in both the long run and short term an all nighter will rough me up. Still, I would love to have a coffee after my 2nd shift and stay up reading or watching tv until 5 and maybe pass out for a couple hours. I don’t drive myself to work so it’s not like I’d kill anyone the next day. 

No, I gotta stop rationalizing. Uggh, life’s gonna suck when I become a grad student. I’m lucky my family has money, because I could probably talk them into letting me work part time and not pay rent or something. Maybe my youthful energy will die out soon and I’ll have only the desire to make it thru work then crash and sleep until I gotta get ready for the next day.

The primary ingredients in Quietum Plus include a blend of natural components such as green tea extract, L-theanine, and chromium, known for their metabolism-boosting and fat-burning properties. These ingredients are carefully selected to complement the effects of caffeine, enhancing its benefits while also reducing potential jitters or crashes. Additionally, the formula includes antioxidants that support overall health and wellness, helping to maintain a balanced body even during weight loss efforts.

My thoughts on our first cruise before I forget.,"This was our first cruise.  We travel often, usually to Europe or Central America.  We wanted to try something different.  

A cruise may or may not of been the right thing for us on this trip because we were looking do a more laid back trip so we didn’t take advantage of a lot of the things offered. 

Things we liked. 

The service.  Not one negative thing to say.  It was absolutely spectacular.  I’m not sure how they get so many people on the same page but it was very impressive. 

Our room.  XL sea terrace.   We spent a lot of time on our terrace.  Loved waking up to the sunrise.  

The people. 

We are in our mid 50’s and on the chill side but like being around a diverse group.  I would say the age range was 30’s-50’s with a few younger and older.    Great diversity with great respect.   I loved it. 

We liked the restaurants.  Not blown away but they were all pretty good.  

The Wake had issues serving hot food.  

Wife’s favorite Pink Agave
My favorite Extra Virgin

Had fun at the Test kitchen and love the concept.  Wasn’t crazy about our menu (except the dessert, it was incredible) but that’s all personal preference. 

The Galley was handy and we were able to find something to snack on if we needed.  

The drip coffee was actually way better than I anticipated. Disappointed in the lattes just because they were made with a single shot of espresso which isn’t typical.  So adding an additional shot makes it a $9 latte 

We got off early at Bimini and grabbed a chair and umbrella on the beach.  Stayed 3-4 hours and had a couple drinks.   Had the music in the background from the pool.   People watched, had a few drinks, jumped in the ocean and headed back to the ship for a nap.   We really enjoyed it.  (Tried the food but it wasn’t for us so we just ate on the ship.  

We found the drinks really good and didn’t have a problem with the pricing.  

I enjoy smoking cigars so I would grab a coffee and smoke a cigar in the early afternoon on deck 16.  That was nice and it was away from everything so I felt good not bothering anyone. 

We are probably not built for cruising but I would 100% recommend our trip to any of my friends that wants to go on a cruise. 

Oh.  Last thing.   Brunch at Razzle Dazzle before getting off the ship was a perfect way to end the trip if you can fit in your time frame.  ",13,1738778055.0,VirginVoyages,0,1.0,False

The first issue is that the coffee machine does not pick up that there is any water in the tank, and it does not pull through the coffee grounds and always beeps to say it is empty

I tried to give advice the first ten years until I realized she had zero interest in change. She just wanted to vent. Fast forward 30 years, THIRTY YEARS of listening to her complain. I have said many times things like hey maybe you could write in a journal, send yourself an email, it's just hard to listen to this all the time. I've been gentle about it, but now I literally just don't respond as she continues this behavior. I always respond other times. She comes to my town on a semi regular basis and never wants to meet for lunch or coffee. I have asked many times. No interest. She just came and stayed five days and texted me as she was leaving how her husband was a jerk the whole time. I was hurt. She stayed five days literally 10 minutes from me but no time or effort to connect.

1iig0li,https://v.redd.it/akyexjt2zche1,Wednesday Dawn Patrol - Techica Zero G Tour Pro Boot Review,"The last storm SLC had 4 days ago had a snow/rain line at 9000’ and 100mph winds on the ridge line. Saturday skiing was great at Solitude though a little warm and heavy. Since then, it’s been around 65° in the valley and probably 55° at normal trailhead elevations. We were scratching our heads how we would keep the dawn patrol streak alive and try and have as much fun as possible with the little time we had. We decided to sleep in a bit more and take the dogs up Millcreek Canyon along Porter Fork road. Snow was terrible and a lot of it was ice and sticks but… many awesome side hits and kickers and some rails set up. And we finished the morning off with some breakfast burritos out of the tailgate from the two burner stove with some coffee. 

REVIEW:

4th season on these boots. I got them for $350 on Bob leisure after measuring my feet carefully and they fit awesome. I have a 98 last, low volume foot, and bulbous heel. I am locked in to these on the skin track and skiing down. I was liking these on paper because they were the lightest, best range, four buckle, stiff charging boot on the market. I’m glad the fit worked out. All the parts on this have been working great. The walk mode and buckles are easily to use with a glove on. 

On long tours I get a little rubbing near the inside ankle bone but some Leuko tape fixes that easy. The liners aren’t great. I put a sliding lock on the laces that has made it easier but the liners have packed out pretty good since I got them. I plan to replace with some intuition liners maybe next season. The boots are super hard to get on. They are a very stiff 130 flex. They sometimes feel like blocks that don’t move at all especially when it’s really cold out. Sometimes for powder I don’t love this feeling and a softer boot would have been nice since I’m not charging so hard like some of these hardos are. To me, this 130 feels a LOT stiffer than my resort atomic hawx ultra 120s. I know that’s a 10 flex difference on paper but it feels like more. 

Since these things so hard to put on and take off because the shell is so stiff, I have ripped the pull handles off the liners and have had to re-sew them on. I have tried taking the liners out and putting my feet in those first then sliding into the boot but that’s just as hard. I did cave for that patriot boot wrench thing and that’s helped quite a bit. 

Lastly. I feel the only thing I’d like to fix is the volume around my ankle. The buckles don’t seem to get good pressure there and I put some intuition liners in there at the shop to see how that feels and it felt much better. I just need a bit more volume there so I feel even pressure on mu shin from the heel through the top of the boot. Right now it feels way too too heavy. Something a boot fitter could fix but I’m cheap and it’s been fine for now. Next season! ",0,1738777806.0,Backcountry,0,0.33,False

1iifyva,https://i.redd.it/66s2ci0syche1.jpeg,Any budget alternatives for this instant coffee?,"Helluuu everyone! Please help me find any budget alternatives for this.

Some places aren’t just hotels—they’re experiences. Hacienda de San Antonio, tucked away in the lush highlands of Colima, is one of those rare gems. It feels more like a private estate than a hotel, blending history, nature, and effortless luxury in the best way possible.

With only 25 suites, it’s intimate and personal. Mornings start with crisp mountain air and views of the Volcán de Colima in the distance. You can spend the day horseback riding through the estate’s coffee fields, wandering its endless gardens, or just relaxing with a cup of their own coffee—once served at the Waldorf Astoria—while peacocks casually stroll by.

The interiors are a mix of bold Mexican colors and elegant European touches, but what makes it special is how homey it feels. The kind of place where they remember your coffee order and exactly where you like to sit at sunset. Every meal is farm-to-table, straight from their own gardens and ranch, and everything about the experience feels thoughtful and personal.

And if you’re up for a little adventure, Cuixmala—its sister property—offers a completely different world of wild beaches and untamed jungle, just a short flight or drive away.

But there’s something about Hacienda de San Antonio that feels like a secret you want to keep—an escape into a world where time slows, beauty is effortless, and every moment is imbued with a sense of place. It’s peaceful, beautiful, and just a little bit magical.

So I ordered both a socks and coffee subscriptions to gift for christmas. My first order was in November and I'm based in Belgium. So far, I have not received anything, all of my packages were held up for weeks in customs. I've finally got a notice a week ago that I had to pay 22 euros in customs in order to get my first package (containing coffee and a pair of socks). Today, I got a second notification for 26 euros for a package containing only socks. This is double the price of the socks alone! (The VTA in itself is not that expensive, but there are very costly processing fees added.)

I'm now stuck with six or seven packages already sent by good store that will probably be subjected to the same fees. I've written to customer service last week but got no reply so far. So my choices are : refuse the packages and maybe get reimbursed by good store, or shell out the fees, which will probably be in the hundreds of euros. 

I had NO IDEA that this was a possibility. I thought good store was IOSS certified and I had paid my taxes on purchase.

I've tried to suspend my subscriptions but [good.store](http://good.store) has been down for me for a few days. 

Really sucky situation. No idea if this is because of Trump's new tariffs, but for now I would advise against ordering anything if you're in the EU. ",7,1738776874.0,nerdfighters,12,0.82,False
1iifmku,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iifmku,Irish Construction - Warning,"First I apologize if this is kind of a mess or out of order, too long, repetitive, badly formatted, etc. I’ve tried my best to summarize from 3+ months of notes.

I’m posting this to warn others about Irish Construction and its owner, Anthony. Hiring this company was one of the worst mistakes I’ve ever made, and I want to prevent others from going through what I did. I took out a home equity loan and had been putting this work of for years so I could spend enough to make a significant upgrade to my home. I paid $8,000 for porch and stair repairs, and other misc exterior work. I expected professional, long-lasting work. Instead, I got rushed, sloppy, structurally unsound results that started falling apart almost immediately. I also experienced extremely unprofessional behavior. This was disappointing because I live in an Irish neighborhood and have Irish ancestry, so I was hopeful they would have more pride in their work and behavior. I will admit that I messed up by not making him provide a written contract and by not withholding my final payment. I was distracted by personal things and thought I didn't know better. I have little experience with construction, but after seeking advice I felt validated in my concerns. After the work was initially done I was unhappy with how it looked, but I at least thought maybe it would hold, but it has already deteriorated significantly. Three months later, there are large cracks, chipping, and other serious issues all over.

Yes, they did do some work, but it was far from good, and definitely not worth what I paid. He has refused to give any sort of refund and I gave them 4 chances to fix things. Instead he has suddenly made up the idea that I owe him money. I have since told him I do not want to speak to him directly unless he has money, and to stay off of my property because I do not trust him.

The original work was done on November 8, 2024. I have included time stamps on many photos.

The back steps are already chipping, revealing the old steps and paint underneath. The retaining wall has multiple large cracks, and the front and back steps have deteriorated significantly. Parts of my home that were perfectly fine before this were ruined by unnecessary, poorly done work. I now have uneven surfaces, mismatched materials, and sloppy finishes that look worse than what I started with.

The retaining walls were built without drainage, despite every professional I consulted afterward saying drainage was absolutely necessary. Anthony insisted it wasn’t needed, which was just his way of cutting corners. I had to hire someone else to install drainage after he refused to fix the mistake. The retaining walls were also noticeably uneven, with one side higher than the other. The material used looked poor from the beginning.

The back steps were resurfaced and repaired without removing the old paint, which meant the new material started peeling almost immediately. Instead of properly fixing it, his crew kept layering more material over it—four separate times—making it worse. The porch columns were another disaster. Anthony used oversized pavers that blocked the stairway. When I pointed it out, his only “solution” was to offer to take a sledgehammer to the columns if I didn’t like them. Instead of helping, he made things worse, and I had to hire another contractor to fix them properly. The parts of the steps that they filled in are already showing as well.

When I contacted Anthony my concerns after getting second opinions, he immediately dismissed my concerns, called the work “perfect,” and insisted I was being ridiculous. He said that the advice I got was ""bs."" Before even receiving my original email with my list of concerns, he asked how his reviews were coming. This is a pattern that I have heard from many many people. He pressures for reviews before leaving the job site.

After I started leaving reviews and filing a complaint with the BBB, Anthony suddenly claimed that I owed him more money. The amount he says I owe has changed back and forth from $1,000 to $1,500, depending on which of his responses you look at. There was never any agreement for additional charges, and he was paid in full—$8,000 total, which was already $1,500 over the original bid. The extra things he now claims I “owe” for were included in our original agreement or were things he chose to do on his own and told me weren’t additional charges. He has claimed he had to walk away from the job with an unpaid balance due to hostility and lies, which is not true. I am a very non confrontational person usually. While they were working I was very unsure of what was happening but I kept quiet because I just assumed I didn't know better. My first communications with him after having a day or two to get opinions were critical but not rude. He is the one that devolved the conversation first. In spite of that I still did my best to communicate in a clear non hostile manner. If being critical of the work and expecting to have something not fall apart after paying $8k and also saying I was going to leave bad reviews is hostile, then so be it lol. 

Beyond the bad workmanship, Anthony’s behavior was beyond unprofessional. When I confronted him about the quality of the work, his response was hostility and intimidation.

At one point, he left a threatening voicemail saying he would file a lien on my house if I didn’t stop speaking out, warning me to “be careful how you proceed” and telling me to “pick up the phone like a man.” I had already made it clear that I would only communicate in writing or with a witness, after I realized that I had been duped, yet he kept trying to pressure me into a private conversation where nothing would be documented.

When we finally met in person to discuss the issues, his opening remarks had nothing to do with the work. Instead, he bragged about being “worth $2 million,” claimed he had been on TV, and talked about how he knew the best lawyers. He then demanded to know the names of people in the community who had shared negative experiences about him and insisted that I “take him to them.” This was bizarre and unsettling.

I was so frustrated with his refusal to take responsibility that I asked him to leave my property, but instead of respecting that, he insisted in a aggressive tone that they would “fix it now.” Against my better judgment, I let him attempt a fix—but just weeks later, those repairs have already failed.

During that same meeting, he made racist remarks, threatened to contact my girlfriend’s boss as some kind of intimidation tactic, and even tried to use casual conversations about our pets against us. One of his workers also yelled at me aggressively for even mentioning that others had shared bad experiences. It was at that point that I asked him to leave, but he insisted on trying to fix something as I mentioned earlier. This meeting was one of the most unprofessional interactions I’ve ever had with anyone who I've paid to do work for me. I have this entire meeting recorded. The wanting to call her boss was so immature. He wanted to call the owner of a coffee shop because my girlfriend was critical of his work and because we shared with him what others told us. He wanted to call because we were ""slandering"" him. The mere fact that he said this with a straight face is somewhat hilarious, but also sad. When I talked about this in other reviews and complaints he has said that I am making everything up, but I have proof.

The racial remarks he made were about ""Mexicans"" as I told him I had had my roof replaced. He got upset that I was “policing” him when he assumed I would “have a bunch of Mexicans up on my roof.” He went on a short rant about ""their quality of work"" etc. etc. I don't know why he said it because the workers that did my roof were 100x more professional, courteous, and skilled. They even explained their entire process, something he never even tried to do. If you need a new roof I highly recommend Hulsey Roofing. They did a great job, which is more than I can say for Irish Construction. Anthony has claimed that I am trying to hurt the working class and St. Louis businesses. This is not true. I will speak highly of businesses who don't take advantage of me and other people.

Since I started speaking out, I’ve heard from dozens of people who have had similar horror stories. The stories I’ve heard since this disaster are appalling. I strongly encourage anyone considering Irish Construction to reach out to their community for first hand experiences. Some folks have even told me not to share what they have said due to fear of retaliation.

He has a clear pattern and playbook that has persisted over years. Including saying one price, refusing to make a contract, and then suddenly he needs more money while working. He pressures to give reviews before leaving the job site. You will notice many review photos are of work that is still wet, before people realize how bad it is.

There is also a history of aggression and road rage from Anthony and or other workers. Some incidents I have been told about include trying to run someone down with his truck in a non work related incident. I have also been told someone in their trucks drove through someone’s yard rather than waiting to pass. While they were working at my home, one of their workers yelled a racial insult at a truck driver driving by. I have been told Anthony has had to be escorted of someone’s property before. He also does not take criticism well. So many people have described combative behavior when you question anything.

I regret hiring Irish Construction and dealing with Anthony. This was an expensive mistake. In hindsight, could I have done some things better like refuse to give him money without making a contract and or to withhold my final payment? Yes, of course. However, I believe a good business should not take advantage of their customers. If you’re considering hiring this company, please ask around first. I wish I had.

I would write more, but this is already quite long. I would also attach more photos, but there is a limit. I also apologize if this is a jumbled mess. It's an ordeal that is hard to summarize. If you want even more information you are welcome to contact me privately.

If you’ve had an experience with Irish Construction or Anthony, feel free to share your story here. I have heard from many people on other social media already. People deserve to know the truth before spending their hard-earned money.",14,1738776850.0,StLouis,4,1.0,False

Java Burn is a term used to refer to the potential weight loss benefits associated with consuming coffee or caffeine. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between coffee consumption and weight management. This article will explore whether Java Burn can indeed help with weight loss and discuss some important considerations.

# Java Burn and Metabolism:

One of the reasons Java Burn is believed to aid in weight loss is its potential impact on metabolism. Coffee contains caffeine, which is a natural stimulant that can increase metabolic rate. This means that consuming Java Burn may help your body burn more calories, even at rest. However, the effect of caffeine on metabolism varies among individuals, and the impact on weight loss may not be significant for everyone.

# Appetite Suppression:

Another potential benefit of Java Burn is its ability to suppress appetite. Caffeine can act as an appetite suppressant, making you feel less hungry and reducing the likelihood of overeating. This can indirectly contribute to weight loss by helping you maintain a calorie deficit.

# Energy Boost and Physical Performance:

Java Burn's caffeine content can also provide an energy boost, making it an appealing choice for those who engage in physical activities or exercise. Increased energy levels can lead to improved performance during workouts, potentially helping you burn more calories and fat. However, it's important to note that excessive caffeine consumption can have negative effects on sleep, hydration, and overall health. It's crucial to consume Java Burn in moderation and listen to your body's response.

# Considerations and Limitations:

While Java Burn may offer some potential benefits for weight loss, it's essential to consider certain factors and limitations. Firstly, the effects of caffeine can vary among individuals. Some people may experience increased heart rate, jitteriness, or digestive issues when consuming Java Burn. It's crucial to monitor your body's response and consult a healthcare professional if you have any concerns.

Additionally, Java Burn should not be seen as a magic solution for weight loss. It's important to adopt a holistic approach that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and overall healthy lifestyle habits. Relying solely on Java Burn without making other necessary changes may not yield significant weight loss results.

Ingredients in Java Burn:

1. Green Coffee Bean Extract: This ingredient is rich in chlorogenic acid, which is believed to have weight loss properties. It may help in boosting metabolism and reducing the absorption of carbohydrates.
2. Garcinia Cambogia: This tropical fruit extract contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which is believed to aid in weight loss by suppressing appetite and blocking the production of fat in the body.
3. Green Tea Extract: Known for its antioxidant properties, green tea extract may help in boosting metabolism and increasing fat oxidation. It also provides a natural source of caffeine, which can improve energy levels.
4. Raspberry Ketones: These natural compounds derived from raspberries may help in increasing the breakdown of fat cells and regulating metabolism.
5. Chromium Picolinate: This mineral is essential for normal insulin function and may help in regulating blood sugar levels. It may also have a positive impact on appetite control and weight management.
6. L-Theanine: Found in green tea, L-Theanine is an amino acid that promotes relaxation and reduces stress. It may also help in improving focus and concentration.

Please note that the specific formulation and concentration of these ingredients may vary depending on the brand of Java Burn.

Java Burn is a term used to refer to the potential weight loss benefits associated with consuming coffee or caffeine. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between coffee consumption and weight management. This article will explore whether Java Burn can indeed help with weight loss and discuss some important considerations.

# Java Burn and Metabolism:

One of the reasons Java Burn is believed to aid in weight loss is its potential impact on metabolism. Coffee contains caffeine, which is a natural stimulant that can increase metabolic rate. This means that consuming Java Burn may help your body burn more calories, even at rest. However, the effect of caffeine on metabolism varies among individuals, and the impact on weight loss may not be significant for everyone.

# Appetite Suppression:

Another potential benefit of Java Burn is its ability to suppress appetite. Caffeine can act as an appetite suppressant, making you feel less hungry and reducing the likelihood of overeating. This can indirectly contribute to weight loss by helping you maintain a calorie deficit.

# Energy Boost and Physical Performance:

Java Burn's caffeine content can also provide an energy boost, making it an appealing choice for those who engage in physical activities or exercise. Increased energy levels can lead to improved performance during workouts, potentially helping you burn more calories and fat. However, it's important to note that excessive caffeine consumption can have negative effects on sleep, hydration, and overall health. It's crucial to consume Java Burn in moderation and listen to your body's response.

# Considerations and Limitations:

While Java Burn may offer some potential benefits for weight loss, it's essential to consider certain factors and limitations. Firstly, the effects of caffeine can vary among individuals. Some people may experience increased heart rate, jitteriness, or digestive issues when consuming Java Burn. It's crucial to monitor your body's response and consult a healthcare professional if you have any concerns.

Additionally, Java Burn should not be seen as a magic solution for weight loss. It's important to adopt a holistic approach that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and overall healthy lifestyle habits. Relying solely on Java Burn without making other necessary changes may not yield significant weight loss results.

Ingredients in Java Burn:

1. Green Coffee Bean Extract: This ingredient is rich in chlorogenic acid, which is believed to have weight loss properties. It may help in boosting metabolism and reducing the absorption of carbohydrates.
2. Garcinia Cambogia: This tropical fruit extract contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which is believed to aid in weight loss by suppressing appetite and blocking the production of fat in the body.
3. Green Tea Extract: Known for its antioxidant properties, green tea extract may help in boosting metabolism and increasing fat oxidation. It also provides a natural source of caffeine, which can improve energy levels.
4. Raspberry Ketones: These natural compounds derived from raspberries may help in increasing the breakdown of fat cells and regulating metabolism.
5. Chromium Picolinate: This mineral is essential for normal insulin function and may help in regulating blood sugar levels. It may also have a positive impact on appetite control and weight management.
6. L-Theanine: Found in green tea, L-Theanine is an amino acid that promotes relaxation and reduces stress. It may also help in improving focus and concentration.

Please note that the specific formulation and concentration of these ingredients may vary depending on the brand of Java Burn.

Java Burn is a term used to refer to the potential weight loss benefits associated with consuming coffee or caffeine. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between coffee consumption and weight management. This article will explore whether Java Burn can indeed help with weight loss and discuss some important considerations.

# Java Burn and Metabolism:

One of the reasons Java Burn is believed to aid in weight loss is its potential impact on metabolism. Coffee contains caffeine, which is a natural stimulant that can increase metabolic rate. This means that consuming Java Burn may help your body burn more calories, even at rest. However, the effect of caffeine on metabolism varies among individuals, and the impact on weight loss may not be significant for everyone.

# Appetite Suppression:

Another potential benefit of Java Burn is its ability to suppress appetite. Caffeine can act as an appetite suppressant, making you feel less hungry and reducing the likelihood of overeating. This can indirectly contribute to weight loss by helping you maintain a calorie deficit.

# Energy Boost and Physical Performance:

Java Burn's caffeine content can also provide an energy boost, making it an appealing choice for those who engage in physical activities or exercise. Increased energy levels can lead to improved performance during workouts, potentially helping you burn more calories and fat. However, it's important to note that excessive caffeine consumption can have negative effects on sleep, hydration, and overall health. It's crucial to consume Java Burn in moderation and listen to your body's response.

# Considerations and Limitations:

While Java Burn may offer some potential benefits for weight loss, it's essential to consider certain factors and limitations. Firstly, the effects of caffeine can vary among individuals. Some people may experience increased heart rate, jitteriness, or digestive issues when consuming Java Burn. It's crucial to monitor your body's response and consult a healthcare professional if you have any concerns.

Additionally, Java Burn should not be seen as a magic solution for weight loss. It's important to adopt a holistic approach that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and overall healthy lifestyle habits. Relying solely on Java Burn without making other necessary changes may not yield significant weight loss results.

Ingredients in Java Burn:

1. Green Coffee Bean Extract: This ingredient is rich in chlorogenic acid, which is believed to have weight loss properties. It may help in boosting metabolism and reducing the absorption of carbohydrates.
2. Garcinia Cambogia: This tropical fruit extract contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which is believed to aid in weight loss by suppressing appetite and blocking the production of fat in the body.
3. Green Tea Extract: Known for its antioxidant properties, green tea extract may help in boosting metabolism and increasing fat oxidation. It also provides a natural source of caffeine, which can improve energy levels.
4. Raspberry Ketones: These natural compounds derived from raspberries may help in increasing the breakdown of fat cells and regulating metabolism.
5. Chromium Picolinate: This mineral is essential for normal insulin function and may help in regulating blood sugar levels. It may also have a positive impact on appetite control and weight management.
6. L-Theanine: Found in green tea, L-Theanine is an amino acid that promotes relaxation and reduces stress. It may also help in improving focus and concentration.

Please note that the specific formulation and concentration of these ingredients may vary depending on the brand of Java Burn.

It might just be the next big wave in crypto. We’ve seen TradFi (traditional finance), we’ve seen DeFi (decentralized finance), but PayFi? That’s where real-world payments and blockchain finally start making sense together. For those who haven’t heard about it yet, PayFi is basically about using crypto for instant payments, but with a twist your money doesn’t just sit there like in a regular bank. It works for you in real-time. Imagine buying coffee, but instead of pulling from your main balance, your on-chain yield pays for it automatically. Sounds wild, right?



The idea of spending crypto in reality would be very nice, but It’s usually a hassle high fees, bad conversion rates, or just not enough places accepting it. Now, Solana is leading the charge here, but what caught my attention is Bitget Wallet jumping into the PayFi game. They’re already set up for multi-chain transactions, making it easy to swap, stake, and trade assets across 100+ blockchains. I won’t say it’s perfect yet, but for once, using crypto for everyday stuff felt practical. If things keep moving in this direction, I can see more people getting on board.

Hotel and flights are already paid for, and I’d like to do some of the touristy things like Universal, Venice Beach etc. I can get a price for those things but what about just a regular day in LA? 

More context, if I spent the day in Dublin I would probably spend maybe €17-18 on breakfast/lunch and then probably €35 on dinner (1 person), maybe a couple of takeaway coffees at €3.50 each.Are LA prices much different? The Euro is more or less equal to the Dollar right now..

And lastly, what might I expect weather wise, and what is the story with paying with credit cards? I seen a couple of posts where people were recommending this but credit cards aren’t a huge thing in Ireland and everything is usually payed for either with cash or with debit card.

I have to take the L and walk a little which is fine. It's just that the last few times I went I had to wait 15 minutes for my train in the cold and my body can't take that.

Why am I having such a difficult time finding employment, specifically jobs I actually wanted in the government field? Bc other jobs, like from indeed etc. I would get called back but they were not really what I was looking for, Or the pay was bad etc. well I guess I forgot that I had my current supervisors contact info In my gov jobs account and she was a reference too. So I started to question... Is she the one to blame? Is she telling these jobs bad things about me? Mhm.. Well eventually she placed me on a Performance Plan. And honestly I thought it was such a tacky thing to do especially due to the fact that I was placed on the plan literally the week I came back from being out due to surgery… any who, I started reading about Performance plans and about peoples experiences with them, a lot suggested I start applying elsewhere bc this is basically the last step before I get fired.. Which I did I applied to jobs like crazy. And again I kept getting rejections or no responses at all. Well I talked about this with a colleague and she told me to check if I have her as a reference and delete her which at this point I genuinely forgot and I thought jobs only wanted or reached out to references if they r considering u for the job not before they even reach out to you. So I go and delete her as a contact. Well time passed... And one day MY Supervisor told her supervisor that she knew I have been applying to other positions because she gets the reference questionnaire/ calls. My supervisor told her supervisor that she calls these company’s back and basically tells them she does not recommend me because “she does not want these companies to go through what they have gone through with me. So because I got ill, and had multiple doctor’s appointments, 2 surgeries in 2024 and felt like absolute garbage the whole year she thinks I don’t deserve a job here or anywhere else. I also do the majority of the work here that they don’t want to do. She doesn’t want to train me in the “harder” or more important tasks because “I don’t know anything” yet she has made me TRAIN the new hires they hired instead of me. She makes me go and pick up coffee for her. And no matter how open I try to be about the issues I might be having here or at home she just doesn’t care. And for a long time, they made me feel isolated, they were rude and condescending when I don’t know how to do something and ask for help and for a long time I stopped asking for help and did make more mistakes but in my head that was better than getting a dirty look or half ass answers. Her and her favorite coworker ( who I suspect is family somehow with her) have been so rude to me from telling me I sound like a man and laughing super load when I was sick and lost my voice to asking me question like “are u married” and when I answer no they laugh and giggle together. Very weird and I brushed it off and focused on my work. I guess I wanted to vent, it feels kind of good to realize that it was not in ur head and they’re mistreating me but it sucks to know that not only does she want to mess me up in my current role but she is also trying to close doors outside of here. She treats everyone else very poorly, and I’m happy to have other coworkers who are actually enjoyable to work with and care. Any suggestions?

Home woodworking project, working on a coffee table having a table top with opposed adjacent 45 degree tapered edges. So let's say you're bending down and you're looking at the edge of the tabletop, you would see the left and right edges tapered at 45 degree going  \\ and /. Now you rotate the table a quarter of a turn, and you would see the edges going / and \\.

The first taper went well sketching one side, drawing a triangle and extrude-cutting the edge. Did the same thing on the opposite side. All good. Now how do I got about cutting the two other sides? When I try to sketch from the tapered face and extrude, the extrusion direction works with the plane of the tapered edge. Not what I want.

Help please?

She asked me to send £500 for a bed for our daughter , I sent the money no problem,  I check the account and see that nearly all her monthly wage has gone only two days after being paid, £740 was spent in one shop, I called her, semi joking, saying what the hell happened in Argos yesterday , which is the shop that £740 was spent in, she spent this on a new mobile phone for  her daughter, my step daughter, my wife is bad at money management and regular goes over drawn as she knows I will just pay the overdraft off and bail her out, I would not mind if she lived pay check to pay check and spent all her money, but this is at the start of the month, meaning, that on top of the £500 for the bed, she will no doubt need money sending for the rest of the month to cover the £740 spent, today she has only £40 in her account.



She spends the money on things that are needed but does not know how to budget and does not respect that some things need to wait.

We had a disagreement, this is something I would have been angry about for all of ten minutes, and she said “You don’t want the kids to have nice things, you just want YOU to have nice things’ and then hung up the phone, for context, my money goes on the family, I buy clothes maybe once a year, I’ve invested in training to get better at my job, and I’ve done on two very short trips on my own (two days each) both of which we’re communicated with her and she gave her blessing, we have also gone on a family holiday, i pay for all bills / expenses, so the idea that I spend lavishly on myself but not my family is ludicrous.  
  
Every conversation since then, I’ve tried to communicate with her that I’m extremely unhappy that her first instinctual response to me setting a financial boundary was to try and gaslight and manipulate me, and hang up the phone to make me angry , she did WhatsApp straight after saying sorry, but there is a problem, she tried to make the apology about the money being spent, rather than the lack of communication and respect, and offered to work weekends to pay it back, I feel like she is doing this to appeal to my insecurities of wanting to be a provider, so she keeps trying to make the issue be the fact that the phone was purchased, or about the money being spent, which she know causes shame inside me, any time I try to explain the issue is not the money, she talks over me, she does not ASK what my perspective is or feelings are, she TELLS me what they are.  
  
She also repeatedly changes the subject to completely irrelevant  topics that she is correct about, my short comings, that I work too much etc, to deflect. The way I tried to describe our communication, whenever I bring to her that I am unhappy with something she has done, is that if the conversation were in a different language , and someone was watching, not knowing what each person was saying, you would think the conversation is based on ME doing something wrong, not her.  
  
She has given me the silent treatment, starved me of affection , giving one word answers, seeing my phone calls, ignoring them, etc, then at home, acting as if nothing has happened. And anytime I’ve tried to have a conversation about what I am unhappy about, I don’t get to finish a sentence.

  
The day after , she came and gave me a coffee which was nice of Her, and she said are you still angry with me, I said YES and tried to explain WHY, she then did not let me speak more than two words any time I opened my mouth and said it was because she didn’t want my step daughter to hear the conversation, this is reasonable, but trust me when I say say this was not the reason she didn’t want me to go down the road. She will happily talk to me about her opinions and feelings but as soon as I respond it’s bad because the kids might hear.  


I then phoned her on the way to work, I explained that I’m deeply upset that its been an entire week now, and still no apology, no attempt from her to hear what my feelings are or perspective, no affection and she’s acting like nothing has happened. She responds with a sarcastic / fake politeness and gives all sorts of verbal queues to let me know that she isn’t taking me seriously,  she then said hold on a minute back in a sec, she returned, ‘oh what is it you were saying? Oh yeah you were talking a load of shit weren’t you’ and then hung up the phone, this is in response to me telling her that I’m hurting, i called her back, she said the only reason I’m so offended by her statement about me not wanting the kids to have nice things is because its true, when it categorically could not be further from the truth. This deeply hurt me and I said how can you say that when I do all that I do for this family? She said you don’t do it for this family you do it for yourself, which doesn’t make sense.  


I have no social life, I bought her a car, in cash, anytime she asks for anything, the answer is always yes no matter the price.  I was so hurt by this that I said that is it we are done, I then called her mother to let her know this, so that I can state the facts before the smear campaign starts.  
  
The last TWO times she acted just like this, turning on me so fast and so far, it turned out she was planning to cheat, and she did, so I looked on her phone out of curiosity, and a guy we had an argument about who was asking her on dates and she didn’t shut it down, had messaged her again, and unsent the message.  
  
She reached out to him to ask if he had messaged and if everything is ok, bear in mind this is someone we nearly broke up over, and bear in mind she hasn’t bothered to reach out to me and ask ME if everything is ok with the argument we have had which at this point has lasted over a week now.  
  
I said to her wow, you really are not scared at all, of pissing me off, are you? She ignored my calls and messages about this, just got on with her day with no care in the world.  This to me is not the behaviour of someone who is scared about losing their partner or upset that their partner is hurting.  
  
Now, in these situations, over the last 12 years, I have to drop the argument, so it never actually gets resolved, and I make up with her, and then we don’t talk about it, I tried to do that, she made me some food which was nice of her. She then goes and sleeps alone with the babies, claims this is to get them used to a new routine, which it may well be, fine.  
  
The next day, I asked can we please talk, she said of course, I calmly sat down with her, and explained that I’m really really hurt, that any disagreement we have, is handled in the same way, which is that she finds a way to turn it round on me, and a conversation about something she has done to upset me, very quickly turns to and ends on her being upset with ME for bringing this to her.  I also said it upsets me that she can decide that this conversation  will become and argument, and if so, there will be nothing I can do to stop it, what does she do? Exactly that of course. She then says I’m weird and that she didn’t do anything wrong with messaging the guy, that she has showed five men the message and they all agree that there is nothing wrong with the message and that they would visit the man and ask him to stop, so essentially saying I’m too much of a wuss and that its my fault, this really really hurt me. In the past she has made me feel so guilty for getting a female perspective on fall outs we have had. To preserve my own sanity, and out of sheer pain , I packed my stuff and left.  
  
I took the kids out for the day, came home, I said do you want to talk, she said yeah sure, I sat there, she is without a care in the world, bear in mind I’ve packed my stuff and left, I said so what do you want to talk about ? Hoping she would apologise, she said in the most carefree way ‘Oh I thought you just wanted to talk about arrangements for the kids’  I said no I’m here to hear what you have to say, about what I brought to you, about how I feel?  Her response was yeah I don’t wanna talk about that. Zero ‘please stay’ / can we fix this, no phone calls / texts for two days, didn’t even check where I was, that I’m ok, anything.  
  
I called a few times, each time she answers with a tone of not knowing who it is, or at least not knowing why I would be calling, not a care in the world.  
  
She then randomly text saying love you good night, she could see on my location that I was at my grandmas house.  


I decide to go on holiday, so I book it last minute, before booking it, I do the right thing, I call her, and ask, shall we all go away as a family, she said no, its really thoughtful but no.  
  
So I go away on my own, in the airport, I get the message im expecting ‘safe travels’ (this is when I find out she can see my location) of course she says I should have told her and does her usual subject changing to things that are completely irrelevant and with the intention of hurting me, I called her, and explained the pain, confusion, anxiety she has caused me , she did not care one bit , has been known to respond to such statements with ‘Ok byeeeee’ or ‘ have you finished? Can I go to sleep now?’ 



I have to explain empathy to her like she is 5, I have to explain, that in any fall out, there is two sides to the story, and the truth, and the healthy way to reach a resolution is to discuss both sides / feelings / perspective / experience and the facts of what happened, she does not operate that way, we are only going to speak about her perspective and how SHE feels about me BRINGING the problem to her, not the problem itself.  


Out of no where she whatsapps me at 3am with a screenshot of a podcast that I have recently been on, saying it was interesting and that she is proud of me, AND that she or the kids have never seen me smile like that (her way of saying that I am more happy out of the house than with her, how dare I have any sort of life outside the house)  


She keeps saying im holding a grudge because I don’t drop it when she has offered a solution, a solution to what isn’t even the problem as she only wants one way communication where I hear her thoughts but she doesn’t hear mine, any time I give my thoughts she changes the subject to all the ways I could be a better dad, completely irrelevant to the discussion.

Why am I having such a difficult time finding employment, specifically jobs I actually wanted in the government field? Bc other jobs, like from indeed etc. I would get called back but they were not really what I was looking for, Or the pay was bad etc. well I guess I forgot that I had my current supervisors contact info In my gov jobs account and she was a reference too. So I started to question... Is she the one to blame? Is she telling these jobs bad things about me? Mhm.. Well eventually she placed me on a Performance Plan. And honestly I thought it was such a tacky thing to do especially due to the fact that I was placed on the plan literally the week I came back from being out due to surgery… any who, I started reading about Performance plans and about peoples experiences with them, a lot suggested I start applying elsewhere bc this is basically the last step before I get fired.. Which I did I applied to jobs like crazy. And again I kept getting rejections or no responses at all. Well I talked about this with a colleague and she told me to check if I have her as a reference and delete her which at this point I genuinely forgot and I thought jobs only wanted or reached out to references if they r considering u for the job not before they even reach out to you. So I go and delete her as a contact. Well time passed... And one day MY Supervisor told her supervisor that she knew I have been applying to other positions because she gets the reference questionnaire/ calls. My supervisor told her supervisor that she calls these company’s back and basically tells them she does not recommend me because “she does not want these companies to go through what they have gone through with me. So because I got ill, and had multiple doctor’s appointments, 2 surgeries in 2024 and felt like absolute garbage the whole year she thinks I don’t deserve a job here or anywhere else. I also do the majority of the work here that they don’t want to do. She doesn’t want to train me in the “harder” or more important tasks because “I don’t know anything” yet she has made me TRAIN the new hires they hired instead of me. She makes me go and pick up coffee for her. And no matter how open I try to be about the issues I might be having here or at home she just doesn’t care. And for a long time, they made me feel isolated, they were rude and condescending when I don’t know how to do something and ask for help and for a long time I stopped asking for help and did make more mistakes but in my head that was better than getting a dirty look or half ass answers. Her and her favorite coworker ( who I suspect is family somehow with her) have been so rude to me from telling me I sound like a man and laughing super load when I was sick and lost my voice to asking me question like “are u married” and when I answer no they laugh and giggle together. Very weird and I brushed it off and focused on my work. I guess I wanted to vent, it feels kind of good to realize that it was not in ur head and they’re mistreating me but it sucks to know that not only does she want to mess me up in my current role but she is also trying to close doors outside of here. She treats everyone else very poorly, and I’m happy to have other coworkers who are actually enjoyable to work with and care. Any suggestions?

My Husband and I are planning a road trip around Ireland and Northern Ireland in May and would really appreciate any advice on our current plans.  A few things to note: we both plan on driving, want to experience some of the pub culture, and want to see as much as we can within reason.

Day 1 - Dublin - we land in the morning so the plan is to drop our bags off at the hotel, grab coffee and walk around the city - book a later afternoon Book of Kells experience in case we have flight delays - earlier dinner at a Pub (suggestions greatly appreciated!) 

Day 2 -  Dublin to Inistioge - pick up rental car and drive to Kilkenny to see the castle and continue to Inistioge which is about 15 minutes from our hotel that evening. (depending on energy levels we are considering driving through Wicklow Mountains, but dependent on Jet Lag)

Day 3 - Inistioge to Killarney - drive to Killarney, stopping at Midleton Estate along the way for lunch and a tasting.  Depending on arrival time, considering taking a stroll in Gap of Dunloe.

Day 4 - Ring of Kerry to Dingle - Understanding we won't be able to stop everywhere along the route, what are the must stops? We have noted Kerry Cliffs (understand it's not technically part of the Ring of Kerry), Derrynane Beach, Ladies View, Torc Waterfall, and Muckross Abbey.  Also, tips on the direction to drive is appreciated! We're thinking counter clockwise just so we don't have to worry about passing a tour bus.

Day 5 - Slea Head Drive to Doolin (cliffs of Moher at sunset)

Day 6 - Doolin to Cong - Stopping in Galway along the way for a few hours, staying overnight in a Castle so want to enjoy that and explore the grounds.

Day 7 - Cong to Westport - Kylemore Abbey and Diamond Hill Hike

Day 8 - Westport to Ballycastle, NI - this is the day that I'm the most nervous about / need the most advice on.  The place we found to stay has a two night minimum, and we want to explore Downpatrick Head, a few spots in Sligo, and Derry (I'm a Derry Girls fan) on the way.  

Day 9 - Antrim Coast

Day 10 - Ballycastle to Dublin - Stopping in Tollymore Forest along the way, probably finishing in Dublin with the Guinness experience or walking pub tour.

Day 11 - Afternoon Flight

I work as a knowledge domain expert for an insurance company’s technical support. I hate the work because it’s so unchallenging, I hate the working from home because I feel isolated and, I know this is horrible, I hate the people I work with. They are nice but they make the work we do so much more complicated than it needs to be, they make changes that make the work confusing and they drag meetings to talk about things that are not worth talking about at work, example, a certain person talks non stop about her cats. I’m not joking, she once made an hour long meeting run over to 2 and half hours. (Yes I’ve complained about this to management but she doesn’t seem to get the message).

Anyway, I recently graduated from University with a degree in media. It’s something I’ve always wanted to do and I bit the bullet and applied at the age of 26 and graduated at the age of 29. I’ve had a few side jobs in research but I live in a small town and there is not many options other than remote.

Anyway, I’ve always wanted to get into photography, specifically wedding/portrait work. I looked up how to get my foot in the door and I reached out to local photographers and asked them for advice or asked if they require a second shooter. I’m meeting with one of them for coffee to chat and the other said I can tag along to shoots he has coming up.

I struggle with falling asleep and staying asleep. Luckily I work from home so I can roll out of bed at 9 AM. But then I fixate on work and don’t eat or drink coffee until like 10:30. 
 
At night, I’m so tired that it’s impossible to get off the couch most nights to go to bed at the time I want to.

Surreal that things are falling apart and yet the day to day remains the same. I understand why in the Discworld series saying ""May you live in interesting times"" was an insult.

I keep forgetting the day of the week, they sort of run together into one thing. Mostly the same one day to the next.

I recently listened to all but the last ACOTAR books, one of them twice. I got so absorbed into the story I devoured them all within a week. My other reading includes Full Catastrophe Living, a guide to mindfulness based stress reduction that my dad gifted me. Today I tried listening to some new audible books, but couldn't get into any of them.

I kind of want to disconnect from everything, move to a remote cabin, and spend my days painting and writing. Instead I am maintaining good attendance and a reasonable work ethic at my day job while plotting how to best make my coaching business so wildly successful i can move to said cabin and paint and write.

Why am I having such a difficult time finding employment, specifically jobs I actually wanted in the government field? Bc other jobs, like from indeed etc. I would get called back but they were not really what I was looking for, Or the pay was bad etc. well I guess I forgot that I had my current supervisors contact info In my gov jobs account and she was a reference too. So I started to question... Is she the one to blame? Is she telling these jobs bad things about me? Mhm.. Well eventually she placed me on a Performance Plan. And honestly I thought it was such a tacky thing to do especially due to the fact that I was placed on the plan literally the week I came back from being out due to surgery… any who, I started reading about Performance plans and about peoples experiences with them, a lot suggested I start applying elsewhere bc this is basically the last step before I get fired.. Which I did I applied to jobs like crazy. And again I kept getting rejections or no responses at all. Well I talked about this with a colleague and she told me to check if I have her as a reference and delete her which at this point I genuinely forgot and I thought jobs only wanted or reached out to references if they r considering u for the job not before they even reach out to you. So I go and delete her as a contact. Well time passed... And one day MY Supervisor told her supervisor that she knew I have been applying to other positions because she gets the reference questionnaire/ calls. My supervisor told her supervisor that she calls these company’s back and basically tells them she does not recommend me because “she does not want these companies to go through what they have gone through with me. So because I got ill, and had multiple doctor’s appointments, 2 surgeries in 2024 and felt like absolute garbage the whole year she thinks I don’t deserve a job here or anywhere else. I also do the majority of the work here that they don’t want to do. She doesn’t want to train me in the “harder” or more important tasks because “I don’t know anything” yet she has made me TRAIN the new hires they hired instead of me. She makes me go and pick up coffee for her. And no matter how open I try to be about the issues I might be having here or at home she just doesn’t care. And for a long time, they made me feel isolated, they were rude and condescending when I don’t know how to do something and ask for help and for a long time I stopped asking for help and did make more mistakes but in my head that was better than getting a dirty look or half ass answers. Her and her favorite coworker ( who I suspect is family somehow with her) have been so rude to me from telling me I sound like a man and laughing super load when I was sick and lost my voice to asking me question like “are u married” and when I answer no they laugh and giggle together. Very weird and I brushed it off and focused on my work. I guess I wanted to vent, it feels kind of good to realize that it was not in ur head and they’re mistreating me but it sucks to know that not only does she want to mess me up in my current role but she is also trying to close doors outside of here. She treats everyone else very poorly, and I’m happy to have other coworkers who are actually enjoyable to work with and care. Any suggestions? Anything I should do to get out of this performance plan successfully? Or can I do anything about this? I would love to hear from you all. ",0,1738775475.0,EmploymentAssistance,0,0.5,False

I was laid off from my job recently and thought that I would be able to find a serving/restaurant job to make some money while I continue to find jobs in my field.

Due to how easily I have been able to get serving jobs in the past (in the NYC and DC areas), I gravely underestimated how hard the job market is here. I have years of serving experience and I have applied to basically every server/host/busser job that has been posted online (culinaryagents), and yet, I have not heard back from a single one..

Does anyone here have experience with these? Do they actually work for relieving arm pain, or is it just a temporary fix? Are there any specific brands or features I should look for?

Anbessa means ""warrior."" She has refocused on bringing the Ethiopian coffee ceremony to the United States, using storytelling and social media, and stories about Ethiopean coffee farmers. She's seeking investors.

  
Bart Emory pitched Eardx. Earbud sleep diagnostics. Not enough sleep doctors to meet demand. Home devices are uncomfortable and difficult to use. Earbuds monitor brain waves as well as physiological factors. Self-applied, reuseable. Seeking FDA clearance for medical devices to bill insurance codes.

  
Sleep doctors are the current target. 4,000 sleep labs, 8,000 doctors. 

  
Good accuracy, extreme user comfort. Not as accurate as another product but good enough.

  
Many companies in this space, such as FitBit, Apple, Samsung, Phillips, as well as specialized companies.

  
Bart has a BS in Neurobiology from Cornell, plus a JD/MBA from CU.

QUESTIONS

How developed is the product? University technology, something is complicated.

Who has the compelling problem? Consumers hate available sleep monitoring devices.

Goal is to have General Practitioners prescribe this instead of sending patients to sleep doctors.

Sleep labs have three to six month waiting lists.

Sleep labs have high complexity patients that need a sleep lab, and low complexity patients that could use a home product.

High-grade EEG not available in home devices.

Better to market to GPs? Market to te 97% who aren't patients of sleep doctors, not the sleep doctors service 3% of the patients.

At what stage is the clinical trial? 20-30 subjects is $50,000.

Technology developed at CU, CU has a patent. Eardx is working on the form factor.

Is the device more comfortable and/or provides more/better data?

Eye movement, jaw movement, EEG, heart rate, heart rhythm. Apple Watch, FitBit can't do this.

  
FDA regulations: can you market the device with fewer diagnostic claims, without FDA clearances, while working on the clinical trial and FDA certifications.

Where are you in the development cycle? What are the use of funds? Signal analysis needs 3-6 months of development.

  
Diagnostics, consumers will pay to find if they don't have a sleep disorder and don't need expensive, invasive treatments.

so I need to lose some fat, I used to go to the gym 6-7 times not even a year ago but then I’ve got super busy with work and have been finding very hard to get back into it.  

So I was thinking about doing at least two block of 8 week strict shreds and 1-2 week break in between. Aiming to lose cca 5kg of fat in each block. 

Basically I know how to do majority of the things, I think what I am struggling is just getting back into it and being accountable, so not sure maybe an app that I can log workouts? And also balancing everything that I am doing currently; I teach spin classes, I am a walking tour guide, and running a coffee shop and then on top of that I’d like to train as well. 

In terms of exercises, I like mixing up between push/pull and interval strength training (eg 3-5 rounds of 5 different exercises, body weight & additional weight with dumbbells, ketball, etc) 

I teach spin 2x a week, which according to my watch I burn 500kcal. And loads of walking whilst doing tours, id say around 2h of walking 3-5 times a week. Aiming to do weights 3-5x a week. 

I think what I would benefit the most is having 1:1 15-30min chat once a week, and just some guidance with workouts and maybe food? I think I need to change the way I workout as I am still trying to do the same as I did before but now I don’t have time to be in the gym for 2h 5-6x a week

My task?

Research—no writing involved whatsoever.

Now, forget all that “market research” stuff you’ve heard about. That’s boring.

Today we’re here to chew caffeine gum and kick ass. Introducing…

# How to Run Product Research for Fun & Profit

***Caveat: This is geared towards freelancers, copywriters and small agencies. We aren't running massive focus groups to test different flavors of Coke for multi-billion dollar corporations, OK?***

First of all, what is the POINT of product research? Why are we doing this in the first place? Just so I can bill my client extra moolah for a month’s supply of peppermint-blast caffeine taurine focus gum with a cool, FREE travel tin that has a badass stingray on the side?

…

NO!

That’s what we in the marketing world call a free ‘bonus.’

Anyway.

The real point of product research is to “become the market,” as we’ve heard a thousand times from every marketing guru under the sun…

And well, you don’t get any more “market” than ordering, receiving, using, and reviewing an actual, honest-to-goodness hold-it-in-your-hands physical product.

Below you’ll find my REAL “clinical trial” that I sent my client (part of a package with wider market research).

Names **REDACTED** for privacy, of course.

# My 7-Day Clinical Trial

I’m a pretty heavy coffee-drinker—about 400 mg of caffeine per day, which is about 10 pieces of **REDACTED** gum. My goal over the next week is to phase out ALL of my coffee intake and replace it with gum. I’ll report any findings below.

# Day 1

* Replaced 40 ml of coffee with one piece of gum
* All caffeine consumed before noon
* Initial remarks on the gum:
   * Taste is absolutely horrible…there’s a blast of peppermint flavor and obvious sorbitol / fake sugary-ness. The peppermint flavor vanishes after a couple seconds, replaced by nasty bitterness/medicinal notes. For a few minutes, all you can taste are the caffeine and fake sugar. By 5-10 minutes, you’re left with a faint breeze of peppermint, but it’s at least tolerable.
   * The texture is super weird. First bite, you crunch right through the gum—it’s crumbly, hard and brittle. At first, I thought I made a mistake and ordered the mints by accident. After a minute or so, the texture transforms into gum and the pieces consolidate…overall, very weird.
   * A lot of these energy/focus gums have complaints about the gum turning into a “wet paper” consistency after chewing, but I didn’t have this issue (only chewed it for 30 minutes). I’ll go for an hour tomorrow…
* On packaging—**REDACTED** shipped the paper packs all jumbled up in a plastic shipping bag with no padding. The boxes were a bit crushed on arrival, which isn’t a great look. They also came with a metal tin as a bonus, but it’s pretty flimsy…as far as bonuses go, it’s flimsy enough that I feel it detracts from the experience.
* **REDACTED** has great packaging design. The gum packs look modern and clean, almost like supplements instead of gum. But they’d look better if they didn’t ride all the way from **REDACTED** to Maryland with somebody’s blender sitting on top of them.

# Day 2

* Replaced 120 ml of coffee with 3 pieces of gum
* Still not used to the flavor
* Nothing remarkable to report

# Day 3

* Replaced my entire first cup of coffee (around 7 am) with 5 pieces of gum
* Chewed all 5 at the same time, to see if there’s any difference in energy levels, as per **REDACTED’s** website
* No notable difference

# Day 4

* Replaced first cup, same as yesterday, with 5 pieces of gum
* Replaced most of second cup with 3 pieces of gum
* Had a really small cup of coffee around noon
* Actually felt MORE jittery today than when I just drink coffee

# Day 5

* Replaced all coffee with gum
* All gum before noon
* Same jitteriness as yesterday
* Still tastes bad…more tolerable

# Day 6

* Had a “cup” of gum (5 pieces) first thing in the morning
* Spread the remaining 5 pieces of gum out all the way up until 3 pm, way later than I normally drink coffee
* Felt WIRED, couldn’t sleep

# Day 7

* Spaced gum evenly throughout the day, all the way up until 5 pm
* Felt wired again, couldn’t sleep

# Final Notes

* While I definitely don’t LIKE the taste, it wasn’t nearly as bad by Day 7.
* The texture is still super weird…hard to crumbly to gum…just a strange experience.
* I didn’t notice any focus “enhancements” while working. Same as drinking coffee, except less fun.
* One of the use cases I thought would be useful is if you’re crashing in the late afternoon but don’t want to drink a cup of coffee…but it was still hard to sleep after chewing the gum.
* I do see how this gum would be appealing if you’re traveling and just need a quick shot of energy.

Overall, I don’t like it. But I can see how it’d appeal to its target market, and on the plus side, it does seem to avoid the pitfalls of most of its competitors.

# What to Look for and Record During Product Research

When you’re deep in the trenches of product research, chewing gum like it’s your job (because, well, it *is*), you need to track more than just *whether you like it or not*. 

Your opinion doesn’t matter.

Here’s what to document:

# 1. First Impressions & Packaging

* How does the product arrive? Is it well-packaged? Or does the box look like it fell out of the back of a dirty pickup truck and got attacked by geese?
* Does the design *look* premium, cheap, or forgettable?
* Are there unexpected *bonuses* included? Do they add value or just feel like junk?

# 2. Taste, Feel, and Experience (If Applicable)

* If it’s a consumable, how does it taste/smell/feel?
* If it’s a physical product, is it intuitive to use, or does it need an instruction manual written in hieroglyphics?
* If it’s a digital/info product, does the experience feel cohesive?

# 3. Usability & Performance

* Does the product *do* what it claims?
* How does it perform over time? (Not just 5 minutes in—does it hold up after a week?)

# 4. Comparison Against Alternatives

* How does it stack up against similar products?
* Is it better, worse, or just a carbon copy of something else?
* What’s *missing* that competitors offer?

# 5. Common Complaints & Issues

* What do real customers hate about it (from reviews, forums, Reddit deep dives)?
* Does it solve a *real* problem, or is it just another shiny object?
* Are there quick fixes that would improve the product instantly?

# 6. Unexpected Insights

* The stuff you wouldn’t have noticed if you just Googled it.
* Something you felt or experienced that might be a *huge* selling point nobody’s talking about.
* Any *weird* use cases or alternative benefits?

Open thine eyes beyond casual consumption—remember, you’re a marketer. Do marketing.

# Key Takeaway?

You can see a couple *pretty valuable* sales angles nestled lovingly in those notes up there—angles you might miss doing ONLY market research.

Can you spot them?

Yes…you there, in the back.

Bingo! The most valuable nugget above is **REDACTED.**

(OK, seriously. Can you spot the huge insight I got that I would NOT have found just doing market research? It’s right there.)

Keep looking.

I'd always loved making drip coffee and have been a long time Chemex and Hario V60 user. Espresso always felt too complicated for me for what felt like a bad taste, though I had a few cups of coffee made in a home setup that changed my mind.

Here's my starting gear:

* Breville Bambino Plus:
   * After 2 months, upgraded the portafilter (Crema), basket (IMS - noticed a big difference upgrading from the Crema stock basket)
   * Using paper filters (51mm for IMS) at the bottom for a cleaner pull on the bottomless, nearly totally eliminates spraying
   * Kept the stock portafilter with a single cup basket, use it for cleaning
* Breville Smart Grinder
   * Reviews seem to knock it but it seems OK? I have no frame of reference though. Will likely be the first piece of gear to upgrade
   * Have read that changing the burr setting from 6 (default) to 3 helps makes a big difference for espresso
   * Added an aftermarket bellows that helps a lot with retention
* Tamp mat, cheap WDT tool, small scale, IKAPE tamper, Normcore portafilter collar (this was the most helpful piece of gear for puck prep)

My biggest tips so far from starting out:

* Biggest change in taste comes from experimenting with grind size + extraction timing + weight
* For gear, biggest jumps in taste quality came from stock breville -> crema -> IMS baskets
* Best quality of life puck prep improvements came from the paper filters at the bottom and portafilter collar (no messes!)

Still very new but every now and again pull an amazing shot! Would love to hear any other beginner tips people have.",4,1738774748.0,espresso,2,0.83,False

I used to be a workaholic girly who could perform exceptionally well at work and stay up working late if needed—but my pregnant self gets tired easily, has a weak grip and poor balance, and has noticeably decreased brain performance.

I used to be able to walk to and from work—approximately 4 km round trip—but during pregnancy, I can barely walk from my desk to the bathroom, which is just a few steps away. I also used to prepare healthy and delicious meals for myself, but now I find it hard to even stand for long during pregnancy.  I find myself catching my breath most of the time, craving food in the middle of the night, and hardly sleeping due to fetal movements—and I am just so beautifully miserable.

Career was always my first priority, and I tried to convince myself that it still was—but everything changed when my pregnant body started speaking. It allows me to function at work, but it also forces me to prioritize my growing baby. It makes me feel tired so I can rest. It makes me feel hungry so I won’t skip meals or survive on coffee alone. It weakens my grip so I can’t carry heavy things or spend endless hours with my hands on the keyboard.  It changes me—in a way I hardly recognize—but in a way that both my baby and I need. It transforms me so I can fully experience the miracle of life.

It also brought out a beautiful version of my husband. I carried our child, but he carried us both. During this time, he showed me the depth of his patience, the sincerity of his care and love, and his ability to put us above everything else in his life.

Pregnancy truly carries a beautiful chaos, one that is unique to every individual and family. It overwhelms us with countless emotions at once—we are excited to bring a new life into the world, yet at the same time, we fear the changes it brings. It reshapes everything—our personal goals, our finances, and our way of living.  Indeed, no one can fully understand it unless they experience it themselves. But one thing we know for sure—we entrust our lives to God, knowing that His gifts and timing are always perfect.

I got out of a 7 year relationship over a year ago. She broke up with me, broke my heart, I moved out and had a complete personality / identity change for the better. After really struggling for like 4-5 months, I slowly got better and am now thankful it happened.

I've been dating someone new recently (\~5 months) and she's wonderful. Everything has been going great. We're planning on moving in together at the year mark.

Recently my ex got coffee with one of my friends as she was in my city and then reached out to me saying that she wishes she could get coffee. My current gf was upset that 1) there aren't clear boundaries (i.e. even though we ended badly ish and I was hurt, she still thinks she can reach out to me and be friends and 2) that I responded to her (we had like a 5 text exchange after she told me she was in my city which was mostly me being like ""oh you're here, what are you doing, etc"". For context, we hadn't spoken in almost 8 months after I stopped responding to her messages.

My current gf and I talked it out and things are fine now, but we had probably our first fight of our relationship about this. For context on her side, there was mutual cheating in her past long term relationship (she was cheated on by her ex WITH an ex (her ex's ex haha) first, and then cheated back).

There was no cheating or anything in my relationship. it just didn't work out. I know my ex wants to be friends. Even though I was upset and I don't see a need to be friends now, I'm struggling to put the kind of boundaries in place that my new gf expects. She insists that she doesn't want me to make any decisions based on what she wants, only what I want, but I know she doesn't want me to speak to her and if she reaches out, shut it down or ignore.

I think I'm being swayed by lesbian expectations of how normal it is to be friends with exes. If she was a man, no one around me would be even considering me staying friends with her. But bc I'm gay, it seems like people have more understanding of keeping her in my life.

What should I do? Just ignore her messages? Tell her not to reach out to me because of my new relationship? Or is my current gf projecting her insecurities onto me because of things in the past?",1,1738774562.0,ActualLesbiansOver25,4,1.0,False

Part of my current research involves assessing flat white quality. As part of this, I need to assess what makes good milk foam for flat whites (as scientifically as possible).  

 Currently, my assessment criteria is as follows:

1. Comprised of microfoam (bubbles diameters <500μm) 
2. Contributes to a balanced flavour profile, due to: 
   * Lactose (65-68 °C) 
   * Casein binding
   * pH buffering 
   * Fat content 
   * Emulsification 

 I do not have the experience to know if this criteria is thorough, hence I am reaching out to ask for advice.  

Firstly, am I missing anything from the criteria? 

Secondly, are there more quantitative ways I can assess this? e.g other measurements of taste/texture 

Finally, I am also planning to conduct user testing as part of this assessment, would you recommend any specific methods of testing to get a holistic overview of quality from a group of regular coffee drinkers? 

Due to shortage of project time, a quick response would be much appreciated.

I have found that my coffees have started to taste much better over the last week without changing anything, very sweet with the floral notes being very prominent. This morning I noticed that there was a precipitate formed on the bottom/side of the container. Stupidly, I mixed it all up again.. and now my coffee tastes bad, it just has acidity, no flavour notes. 



I'm wondering if anyone can offer guidance on getting my water closer to how it was before I mixed it back up. I plan to make separate concentrates for buffer and hardness, which I should have done from the start. From what I can gather- Epsom salts are more water soluble than baking soda, so the precipitate would likely have been more baking soda? So I probably want to aim for a higher hardness with less buffer. But that seems backwards based on the taste that I experience, since buffer should tame the acidity? I am certainly no chemist, so I welcome any guidance!



Here's the Barista Hustle recipe I've been using:

-8.6g of Baking Soda and 25g of Epsom Salts to 500g Deionised Water, this is your concentrate.

-Mix 2g of concentrate with 500ml water



Thank you all!



*Edit-
I did try simply reducing the amount of concentrate in the total brew water by half and a quarter. It got closer to how it was, but it didn't have the same clarity as before. This led me to thinking the precipitate changed the proportion of buffer to hardness.",1,1738774386.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

I do want to mention that his profile was not fully completed, and did not list what kind of connection he was looking for (ex. long term relationship, intimacy without commitment, etc.)
We recently met up with each other for 3 days straight and spent at least 5+ hours together each time we met. The very first night we met, we stayed together from 5PM - 4AM. Nothing sexual but just getting to know each other and having fun.

He hasn't initiated any physical contact but he has done things that stuck out to me such as paying for dinners, hand feeding me food, making direct eye contact, offering his scarf/coat, and asking me questions to make sure l'm comfortable (""are you cold?"" ""are you tired?"" ""are you hungry?"") When we visited a PC cafe, there was a couple's play area and he suggested we sit there together (but maybe I'm overthinking that one). Bare minimum, I know, but dating in the US has been.. rough. 

It seems that he enjoys my company because whenever we finish dinner/coffee, he's thinking of a another thing for us to do to continue our time together. Needless to say, these actions along with his personality made me become attracted to him.
My issue is that, as an American girl, I'm used to knowing where I stand with a man after 3 dates.
After 3 dates, usually they will initiate physical contact (hugging, kissing, hand holding) or ask more romantic questions, which hasn't happened with him yet. So I figured there may be cultural differences leading to my confusion but I like him as a person, not to mention he is VERY physically attractive and I want to take the chance to see if this can become more.

I'm considering asking him bluntly, ""what is your intention with me"", or to see whether he makes the next move. That's if he even sees me as a romantic interest, but based on his actions, I think maybe he does...?

Should I ask him about his intentions? Make it clear I'm interested in him? Or will that come across as desperate? 😰 What do you think I should do?

TL;DR: I have a crush on a Korean guy and I'm unsure if I should make a move on him. I think he likes me back because he does thoughtful things that a man in a platonic relationship wouldn't normally do, but I'm not sure if I'm
misunderstanding his kindness as interest since our cultures hold different values. I'm debating asking him about his intentions or seeing if he makes the move. What would you do?",1,1738774354.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Now my 25-OH-D3 level is at 62,22 ng/ml, confirmed by a lab via. blood samples.

I took my supplement every morning with a cup of milk coffee as I assumed it should have enough fat for absorption, and it seems like I was right, as I always skip breakfast and that's my only fat intake in the morning.

Side note about magnesium: I also took 665mg magnesium oxide daily at the beginning but discontinued it after a few weeks because of drowsiness and I also started getting some sort of breathing discomfort with my seat belt on in the car. I will only supplement magnesium again if I start getting random leg cramps in bed. That's usually my sign for low magnesium which I experienced when I was lifting heavy weights regularly at the gym. I seem to be getting enough magnesium from my diet already. Despite what people write online, magnesium oxide definitely has an effect on me even if it's not that well absorbed as other forms.

So now let's compare how I felt before and after (now).

**Before:**

* I felt down a lot and felt fatigued
* I was anxious about things I shouldn't be anxious about
* I had difficulties falling asleep and the sleep I got was bad
* I was irritable
* I had some patches of eczema since I was around 15

**After:**

* I feel pretty good and have more energy
* I feel more at ease / relaxed and my mood is way better
* my sleep has definitely improved a lot
* my eczema that I had since I was 15 completely went away after about \~4 months of supplementation, first improvements were seen about \~2 months in (patches started getting less red/inflamed)

Now that I think back to when I was in my teens, my eczema makes a lot of sense. We moved to a very cloudy country and I started spending the majority of my time indoors as well so I must have had a low Vitamin D3 level since then. Nothing else has worked and I've tried a lot believe me, so I'm 100% certain it's Vitamin D3 that cleared it. I've done extreme food elimination in the past to find if the cause of my eczema was food intolerance related but it was not.

Thank you all for providing all this information and discussion about Vitamin D3 in this subreddit, it has helped me a lot!

I will continue taking it daily and do another lab test in about 6 months to see where I stand.

WRONGGGGG i have literally weighed the same 148/149 for the last three weeks. 

I track everything, weigh food, and exclude exercise, eat 90% clean, and drink maybe once a month. im regularly under my weekly calorie goal by anywhere from 300 to 2000 some times. I have never been over my deficit. 

I have worked really hard to establish new eating habits and keep myself on track. Im working out 2-3x a week in the gym with weights and running 4-5 days, about 12-15 miles a week.  

This has been pretty discouraging and im not sure what to do - my daily calorie budget is 1580 and i just dont know if i could go much lower/if it will even help considering im usually under my goals anyway. I would like to be around 135 by May. 

I do have PCOS but things have been pretty good for me recently, especially since im largely eating whole foods, cut out coffee, etc.

1iieju1,https://i.redd.it/vnvb39ajoche1.jpeg,A little look into Tim's workday with a little twist," (Pls read his background lore to actually understand who he is and pls ignore how sloppy I wrote it)

It was the 27 in October in his second year contract in Tim’s light tower  

It was an early day. The sound of a loud generator was heard in the background but like everyday for the last 2 years there was always a White-tailed Ptarmigan or better know as a snow chicken or aka The awebo bird screaming at his window. 
Ofc Tim did wake up and his first response was to scream back at the awebo Bird  

“It’s f#cking 3 in the morning, shut the f#ck up”
It kinda became a tradition between the two. Tim honestly loved the awebo bird but it was driving him nuts each morning. 

After getting dressed and ready he would just take a seat in his makeshift living room which was nothing much then a comfy chair and a little table with a little of lights dangling from the ceiling. He kinda just fell into the chair staring at his sandwich and coffee for a couple of minutes before drinking the coffee it in three sips and only finishing half of the sandwich. 
He just sat there in the chair staring at the clock on the wall and questioning which actions brought him here but he was back then desperate for money. He was clearly zoned out but he quickly snapped back and started talking to himself 

“Why the hell did we accept that contract actually…Oh sh!t it’s already 6”

He would leave his half eaten sandwich on the table to rush into the basement grapping his headset on the way and a big flashlight. He would stop in-front of the stairs leading into the basement and talk to himself. “When tf did the coast guard refurnished this place for the last time?” His words were almost swallowed by the loud sounds of the generator. Turning his flashlight on he would just walk down into the basement with each steps creaking on the wooden stairs. There he stood in font of a giant steam punk looking generator and would flip a couple switches and push some buttons before pulling a big leaver the size of his arm to finally shut off the giant generator. 
“This beast gotta be older then my grandpa if I had one”

This being said he would exit the basement where each light he left on before going down was out or flickering due to the generator being turned off, he would go up onto the base floor and grab his black scarf and wrapping it around his neck before he stepped outside
“Snow is early huh?” he would mumble to himself before stepping outside and grabbing a broom on his way out. The strong winds hitting him directly in the face like a truck, as a response to that he would stumble a bit back before continuing his way to the solar panels which where coverd deep in snow, he began to remove most of the snow. 

Suddenly mid process the loud howling of wolves could be heard, Tim’s face went immediately pale and his head snapped around to look a the tree line near his lighthouse his first thought where “Why are wolves on this island in the middle of the artic?” The thought of wolves possible stalking him the last two years sent a shiver down his spine and instantly he would grab for his AA-12 which was not as he thought on his back. He was outside without no protection and the tree line was closer to him then the light house. He dropped his broom and reached for his flare gun as a last resort 
 
He would slowly back up keeping the tree line in his sight as the howling of the wolves slowly approached. 
Only being a couple of meters away from the door to his lighthouse the Wolves would appear in the tree line, his heart sank at the sight. He left his instincts to take over, ignoring any logical rules, he made a dash for it reaching the door and slamming it behind himself, the metal door would slam close, the howling of wolves was directly in front of his door, they started scratching at the metal door which was only being kept close by sheer will power and it only opening to the outside but it wouldn't take long for the wolves to find out, so he quickly pushed the red button near the door with was labeled “Wildlife protection system”. With a loud crashing sound the mesh metal bars would fall behind the door barricading it. 

Tim’s breathing which was still heavy, he could feel the adrenaline pumping through his veins, hear his own heartbeat, his survival was only thx to his will power. He would fall against the wall behind him back first, leaningon it and start to try to talk some sense into himself “Hey you good, you still alive..” The scratching and howling of the wolves was still heard outside. 

His mind would start to race again on how wolves made it to his island where he was stationeded he saw the occasionally ice bear but he made sure to spray the area around his island with bear spray, his mind still racing to try and find a answer, in the meantime he went into a storage room to grab his AA-12 (Automatic Shotgun) and a hatchet, preparing for the worse

Suddenly he could hear a window break from the kitchen and his face yet went pale at the realisation

Her family seems like a very supportive group, and they are always offering support and a safe space for friends of hers etc. Another thing to note is that hey are heavily Christian (they pray at restaurants for example). I was raised with no religious upbringing, and I do not intend to pursue that. Another note, I lost my little sister when she was 16 two years ago (2023). My friend was there for me through that, and became like my own little sister. She filled the empty spot for me. Not replace, since they were such different people, but a new support system. My friend’s family was supportive through the death (my sister had a terminal illness that we found out about only months before). 

Now, even though I appreciate the support and them always inviting me for family time, it can be too overbearing from the mother. She will invite me weekly to things, and for a while, I’d say yes because I didn’t want to be alone. She also constantly invited me out just solo, without my friend and it got to a point where she was joking that I was her daughter.

My family dynamic is not super strong. My older sister lives far away and my parents aren’t the best emotional support for me all the time. 

So taking that into account, personally I had no issue when we were grabbing coffee or a meal here and there (like once a month would be good enough for me) but the last time we got together it made me uncomfortable. We were leaving a farmers market and she was like “Bye daughter! It’s like I’m your mom hahaha!”. I gave a slight smile and went to my car. I did mention previously when things were tough with my mom, but everything has been fine recently. I don’t share too many details about my family with her these days. I lived in an apartment last year for senior year of college (still in my hometown), and while I was searching she kept saying I could just move in with them. I said “Well, I want to be independent and get out of my parent’s house.” In a nice way of course. My friend was there for this and she told her mom that I need a space to grow my wings and basically nicely told her mom to tone it down. My friends mom has tried to get me to join her at church before and a senior ladies bible study (I said no thank you) and she gave me a bible to take home once. I didn’t say much I just said thanks and took it. Didn’t say anything else about that. My friend is a strong believer as well but she always talks about it from an internal perspective and hasn’t ever forced anything on me. We’ve had respectful conversations about faith previously.

Anyway. Theres so many thoughts here and I don’t want to sever the relationship, but I’d rather focus on the relationship with my friend and maybe catch up with the family all together. Instead of one on one. How do I tell my friends’ mom or give her a hint that my priority is my friendship with her daughter? Or that I appreciate the support but I don’t want to keep spending time with the family that is not my own. Like I said I enjoy hanging out when my friend is there but being there without her makes it feel weird to me.

Sorry for all the jumbled thoughts but there’s five years of history here and a lot that I’ve had to think about. Right now, I don’t hang out with the family much, or friends mom. Maybe once a month? Friend’s mom just asked me to hang out this weekend at their house, and my friend might be there this weekend. My friend is in college out of town so I see her couple times a year. Ask any questions.

1iiefcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lutheranism/comments/1iiefcv/some_advise_needed_if_you_have_5min_to_read/,Some advise needed if you have 5min to read.,"Please give me reasons why I should stay a Lutheran.

First of all: I am fairly liberal in most topics. I don’t care if the pastor is a women or a gay man. I myself am very conservative in my personal life (some friends jokingly call me a “crypto-orthodox” for I am one of the very few that fasts or has Icons at home). I am pretty happy with Lutheranism, because I agree with the classical Lutheran teachings mostly. So theologically speaking I am at home.

My problem is the local Church here where I life (Austria). As said I don’t care about who is pastor, or if there is a gay wedding in the Church whatever, or if very few actually even pray. I myself am a horrible sinner, so why could I condemn anyone else? My list of sins is long, I am in no position to lecture anyone about their lives.

What is a problem for me is that actually most people don’t take Christianity serious. Let me tell you only a few instances to demonstrate my point: I know quite a lot of people that are “higher up” in Church hierarchy or making a career currently. They (privately) told me quite openly that they don’t believe in Christianity. They see Church as some kind of “fun organisation” and like “the vibe”. But Jesus for them is nothing more than some “cool dude who said good stuff”. I don’t have anything against liberal Theology in itself, but there is a breaking point, where it stops to be Theology and just some “life advice” or “soft therapy”. It goes as far that the majority of my peers (at least at University) flat out deny the resurrection of Christ as a lie, or deny the real presence of Christ in the Lord’s Supper, or that the Bible is even accurate in the portray of Jesus himself, so ditch the Bible we make our own Jesus!

Then you have the “questionable events”. Like there was a “Harry Potter themed Liturgy”, where everybody dressed up as Dumbledore, Snape, etc and read Harry Potter during Church Service on a Sunday. Like don’t understand me wrong: If you want to make such a thing on a Friday afternoon with the church youth group, do whatever you want, but instead of the Sunday service?! That wasn’t my church, but I overheard a conversation (of people described earlier) where someone wrote a letter that he left the Church because he is part of it because of Christ and not because of Dumbledore. The utter disrespect with which they talked about that man was just disgusting. Like they couldn’t understand the man’s problem, why he would disagree when on Sunday instead of the Gospel Harry Potter is read in Church! “It’s better that such fundamentalist are gone from our Church...” Like excuse me? There are more similar instances like that, where Christ and the Gospel is kicked out of the Church for some alternative program. There where Taylor Swift songs played as a program. Now they put up a new agenda for the Liturgy where the “Kyrie eleyson” (germ. Herr erbarme dich!) will be changed to “God erbarme dich” (God have mercy) because “Herr” is not gender inclusive enough and some people might get offended, even though the Bible is very clear that Jesus Christ is the Lord!. The Our Father is still the Our Father for now, but seeing how things play out in Germany I give it max. 5 years and we will say “Our God” because calling God Father is not inclusive enough or so.

The next point is the reason why I don’t go to Church. There is no congregation in my knowledge who has people in my age group. Most congregations are 60+ old ladies who see Church as a coffee gathering instead of some spiritual pursuit. I have talked to them I know. And the few people in my age are scattered around ( and not going to Church if there isn’t a Harry Potter Liturgy then they go, but Christ alone is to boring, they don’t believe in him neither...). So I don’t feel at home anywhere, because I like a traditional Lutheran Liturgy that for the most part isn’t existing in favour of very low Church alternative Programs. Don’t understand me wrong again: I have nothing against low Church Liturgies, but then I can also go to the Baptists or Methodists, at least there they believe into the Bible. But the reason I don’t go there is because I want a “high church” and I don’t agree with their view of the Lord’s Supper. Catholicism is also deteriorating very fast in opinion. It heavily depends where you are, but all of the mentioned problems are also present. So the only option would be the Orthodox, but there I am not allowed to partake in communion.

But what really got me is what happened lately at University. One course I have to take was by a predoc assistant (so not even a Ph.D.!!! some random dude who did the course). The task was to analyse a sermon. For those who know German it is available on YT (Quinton Ceasars Evang. Kirchentag). In my opinion it was far too political for Church. It is not the topic itself, but how he delivered it. I even gave numerous ideas how one could have done the sermon on a biblical basis or from the Church Fathers and so on. There is in my opinion no necessity to stuff your sermon full of “black lives matter” or “last generation” (climate group) or “God is queer”. At this point he was just provoking. All of what he said had no spiritual or Christian connection but just politics. What really pushed me over the edge is that at the end he misquotes the Bible and fakes a Jesus quote. So I wrote in my assessment that the sermon was horrible in my opinion and explained in detail why what that pastor did was not acceptable in my opinion. “Who misquotes Scripture has no place on the pulpit” I wrote. That nobody guy/substitute didn’t like that, said I wasn’t objective enough and that I didn’t understand the assignment. Sorry but the difference between Lutheranism and some non denominational Church is that we have given guidelines in dogmatic topics. Every Sermon has to abide by them. I cannot go on the pulpit and invent Jesus quotes how I see fit to justify my political beliefs. It is not that I disagree with the preacher on the topic, but I disagree that the Sermon is 1. Not the place for political messages, 2. that how he chose to deliver his message was very inappropriate.

Long story short, now I got a negative grade. That really did push me over the edge. Why do I even study Theology? Why do I even bother to learn the Lutheran dogmatic, if at the end of the day everybody can do as he/she sees fit. I even get punished because I voice my opinion that the Church has little to do with Christ anymore. When I sit at Church next to a non-binary girl I couldn’t care less, and partake in communion with her. But when the cross is covered by a rainbow flag and the Sermon doesn’t include Christ or even a sentence of scripture but the green party’s climate program, I voice my opinion that I go to Church for Christ nothing else, for that I get accused of a hate crime or being homophobic, or being some fundamentalist.

Help me please! As said the only option I see at the moment is to go Orthodox. But that has quite different problems I don’t want to go into here. I really don’t feel at home in Lutheranism anymore, not because I don’t believe in Lutheranism, but because the Church has reached a state where I really don’t feel any grace is left. So I stay at home, pray my prayers, go to the Lord’s Supper once or twice a year. Like if I had some regular job, and didn’t study theology I would have converted probably years ago. Sadly I don’t have the option of a more conservative Lutheran branch like LCMS or SELK in my country. Like at this point I really don’t care anymore. My faith in Christ is stronger than ever! But my faith into the Church is gone, sadly completely up to the point where I would publicly say that Christ is no longer present in the Lutheran Church here.

I am thankful for every Comment, Prayer, Answer, Idea, Thought.

What I am really thankful is that through the Grace of God I rid myself of the hate in me, so that I pray for those who desecrate our faith. Lord have mercy on them! Show them your truth, and lead them to salvation for who will remember thee in death? (Ps 6)

May God bless you, your loved ones, your family, your Church, now and ever and for ages of ages, Amen.",5,1738773929.0,Lutheranism,2,1.0,False

For many many years, decades, the plan for world lockdown and biometric commerce has been painstakingly laid out in excruciating detail. Your vote doesn't matter. Which owned pedophile is playing the lead role in the Whitehouse doesn't matter. 

Covid was a test run and everything is right on schedule. It's boring and stupid. All the political drama. All resistance is manufactured. It may seem real to biological computers running the programs. But if you didn't write the program you're running you are an NPC. Maybe you're a Trump NPC? Maybe you're an obsolete Obama NPC? Still some old Bush NPC's running around. Or maybe you're a Musk NPC? Or an Alex Jones NPC? It's hard to dev null that programming. Resisting it is a just another function or subroutine.

    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\

    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

So quite a few years back my parents and I were on a road trip and we stopped by those gas station coffee place/mini market places for a break. While we're sitting there, a man somewhere in his sixties or maybe older walks in (we saw him parking, his wife was waiting in the car) and order a black espresso and a second espresso with ""lots of sugar"". Emphasis on ""lots"". The barista raises an eyebrow because ""lot of sugar"" isn't really specific. ""A *lot* of sugar!"" he confirms, smile brighter than the sun. At this point the barista is borderline giggling. ""Six tea spoons?"" she asks, joking. ""SIX tea spoons!"" he bellows.

And that's the moment where every single person in the mini market drops whatever it was they were doing to stare at this man completely and utterly flabbergasted, while his dear oblivious wife was reading a magazine at the passenger seat.

The poor barista's expression was a mix of O\_O and :C. The *other* barista froze mid order. My mom and I turned to each other in stop motion, then back at him. No, this guy was 100% serious.

I don't even know HOW she fit that much sugar in the cup? There are hyper-specific cups for espresso, they're *teeny tiny*, and I SAW the cups when he received the order, they were identical. How do you even fit six teaspoons of sugar in that thing. What kind of *consistency* did that thing have. *Espresso syrup*? I mean, sounds delicious - ON A DESERT, not to drink straight up! Did the barista cheat on the sugar? I don't actually recall? I was watching her but it's been a while. Was that thing even EDIBLE? I mean, I have a sweet tooth that has caused me a bad tooth or five but SHEESH.

Noise only really started back up when the guy left the mini market.

My mom and I's only conclusion was that the guy was banned from sugar.

Grab a bunch of raw material bottles (if you have dilutions, use those). Grab 2 at random, and with your eyes closed, hold them under your nose and make note of the impression. Sometimes you'll be able to notice the two notes, or one of them, but sometimes it'll do the magic thing of A+B=C where you just smell an interesting new thing. If the two materials aren't balanced, just hold one closer to your nose and the other one further! Once you've written down your impressions, reveal the materials - they can be surprising sometimes. 

Here are some of my notes for interesting cases (more than half of the match-ups have been meh at best and blergh at worst, so this is a selection of some of the good ones):


- Apritone + Veramoss: ""interesting banana bread / baked banana note""

- Benzoin + Matcha ketone: ""Custard! Flan! The benzoin is the obvious warm vanilla but the MK makes it ""set"" somehow. Panna cotta? Crème brûlée ?""

- Bitter orange EO + Irotyl: ""Coke bottle gummy sweets""

- Dimethyl hydroquinone + Irotyl: ""whiteboard marker!!""

- Aphermate + Cassis 345B: ""green pliable wood, like carving willow/hazel bits and peeling the fresh bark off""

- Coffee CO2 + Gamma-decalactone: ""very fresh green grass blades, bordering on stinkbug""

- Methyl ionone gamma + Suederal: ""pretty damn nice! Going to the swimming pool / new swimwear + equipment""

- Atlas cedar EO + Ethylene brassylate: ""surprisingly, somehow pretty similar to orchid flower""

- Ambrocenide + Matcha ketone: ""INCREDIBLY similar to milky sour peachy baby breath!!! Baby worn clothes""

- Helional + Phenyl ethyl acetate ""like the non-apple part of a pretty nice cold cider scent""

- Fructalate + Linalool: ""nice fruity tapenade, rich""

- Ethyl heptanoate + Methyl ionone gamma: ""Blackcurrant or raspberry cordial""

- 2-methyl pyrazine + Gamma-decalactone: ""LOVELY sweet bitter-almond""

- Coffee CO2 + Isobutyl phenyl acetate: ""pretty good hot chocolate note""

1iidzkw,https://i.redd.it/tfbuln8ekche1.jpeg,My first session experience,"So I (M 35) just had the first SMP session today. This was the best decision of my life. I’m gonna focus mostly on things that I didn’t know about (and I have done extensive research) or things that I think might be valuable for other folks thinking about getting it done. Or simply what I would have liked to read yesterday before my first session. 

The first session took around three hours but I’m already feeling amazing and excited for the finished product. Three more sessions to go. Next one is in two weeks. 

The artist said since he realised I tolerated the pain well, he was able to get bit more done in the first session in terms of distance between dots/density then usually. From up close it’s clear it’s not done yet, but from like 1,5m, it already is starting to look so so so amazing. 

The artist made me feel very comfortable. I was a bit nervous in the very beginning. Especially because I didn’t have coffee in the morning 😀

Products I used to moisturise my scalp rigorously before the treatment (3 weeks)
I used my regular skin care routine moisturisers. Kiehl's midnight recovery cloud cream for PM routine and then ultra facial cream from the same brand for AM. The artist said my scalp skin was very well hydrated and made the job and everything lot easier and less painful as well I think. But any moisturiser will do the job if you really do it daily I think. 


Pain/Did it hurt?
I’ve never had any tattoos so I can’t really say if it’s a similar sensation. Yes. It was a bit painful. But it’s not the actual pain from the needle that’s making it painful or uncomfortable. It’s the knowing that next painful pinch is coming in a second and then another one and another one and another one. So it’s more in your head painful or about the feeling of the pain - psychologically speaking if you know what I mean. Since I had micro needling done on my face couple weeks ago, it’s a very very similar experience and sensation. If you’re scared of the SMP pain, go and get skin micro needling done at a salon. And then imagine that done on your head. But micro needling was more painful. 

The artist said there are areas where it hurts more, such as front of your head or sides and temples. For me it was the temples and upper sides. But then there are areas in the back where it actually felt kinda nice and pleasant, like scratching an inching on your head you didn’t even know you have. He started from areas where it hurts the most to get it over with. 

What does it look like after the first session?
From up close, you can still tell it’s not done, but it kinda already looks good from further away, but seeing the progress already made me want time to go faster so I can continue the journey. There definitely was a wow moment when I saw myself for the first time. Don’t study the details, it’s a work in progress. Trust the process.

Feel free to ask anything.

I have a K-2500 unit that was plumbed to the waterline. We decided to move it to a new location (after it sat for a while) and capped the water line and added the pitcher.

We cannot get it to draw water in on it's own. We've gone into the technician screen and can get all three tests to run fine. We've been using the cold water pump test to make coffee as a work around. 

We've tried draining the unit from the descaling hoses, all three tests multiple times, jiggling the pitcher... nothing seems to work.

Is there a way to hard reset this unit? It can't be air in the system if the cold water pump test runs perfectly and draws water in from the pitcher to refill/reheat?

We did get two errors regarding overpressure, but those errors have no repeated since.

My husband and I are in a very tight financial situation because he let us go into debt without telling me. He hid this lie for 6 years and I randomly found out two years ago because our account was over drafted. He didn't come fully clean with me and based on my instincts I opened his mail to find even more loans and credit cards he had opened without telling me. 

For a while we were doing really good trying to reduce spending and keep tabs on all our expenses. But now he is starting to get too lax and it's driving me nuts. 

Just two days ago he agreed to keep expenses very tight because I'm trying to find where we are spending extra money. Then last night he told me he wants to be a coffee every morning before work! We have coffee and travel mugs at home. This blew my mind. 

I have a lot of other issues with him but another recent one is, when I am sick he kind of isolates me. He is not a good care taker whatsoever when he definitely used to be. When we were dating and I had my period he would buy me snacks and put movies on for me. Now he doesn't do crap for me. When I had Covid he left me alone in the bedroom and never came to check on me. 

Last issue I want to mention is that he doesn't take good care of himself. If it's the weekend he won't shower unless he thinks we're going to be intimate. His lack of hygiene is turning me off. 
He doesn't eat well enough at work during the day which causes him to be exhausted and feel sick. Two times it has caused him to go to the hospital because he doesn't properly hydrate or eat enough. Which of course then it's my responsibility to take care of him (as well as our kids). 

I've spoken to him frankly about this concerns right in the moment because I want to be a good and clear communicator. But these things dont change and the biggest issue of all is I don't trust him because of the finances.

A strong stench hits you open your eyes and see Aunt Mary's huge ass that is still sitting on your face and farts, Aunt Mary releases a series of farts and you are forced to smell it the smell is terrible.

At a certain point aunt Mary moves and puts her asshole in your mouth and releases a fart that then becomes 10 then becomes 30 and then fifty farts in a row that have all entered your mouth their taste and smell are terrible and they taste of expired milk and rotten eggs plus they are all morning farts, after about ten minutes that Aunt Mary farts in your mouth and in the nostrils she wakes up.

Aunt Mary gets up and turns to take the blanket and fix it but as she turns around she sees you and says:

M: what are you doing here? Did you want to be my fart pillow?

T: .....

M: come on, today is an important day (today is aunt Mary's birthday).

You get up slowly and Aunt Mary asks you if you can make her a coffee you say it's okay and you go to the kitchen and make her a coffee but by mistake you add a little milk but you're too dazzed by all the farts you've received to notice and you go to Aunt Mary to bring it to her she's on the couch she thanks you and tells you

M: Thomas come now and put your nose between my buttocks and smell that I feel a little gassed if you don't know that there will be serious consequences.

You even if you don't want to because you know that ass is a monster and then aunt Mary doesn't know what you had to go through all night and all morning, you get closer you sit on the couch you lie down and put your face between her buttocks and aunt Mary starts farting 10,15,20,25 times and the smell is super bad it's the worst smell you've ever smelled.

Aunt Mary drinks her coffee all in one gulp and feels that there is something strange and asks you with a furious tone

M: Thomas by any chance did you put something in my coffee?

T: with nonchalant you say yes, I put some milk

M: why did you put it on? You know I'm intolerant, now you'll pay the consequences she gets up and tells you to lie on the floor on your stomach up and you do it and then Aunt Mary pulls down her underwear and pants and sits on top of you with her ass pointing straight to your nostrils and starts releasing a series of very wet and super smelly farts plus her ass is big enough to cover your whole face so that there are no outlets outside of Aunt Mary's Gas.

You start to breathe that ugly Gas and your Aunt Mary starts releasing 20-30 farts in a row after releasing all the farts she gets up and runs quickly to take the blanket and put it on it so her aroma doesn't escape from your nose, after covering you she runs and goes to get something she had bought the day before, shortly after she comes back with this big elastic (the one used to stretch) she puts it and brings it to the level of her ass then she tells you to stick your head in her ass as soon as you do it she puts the other Part of the elastic behind your head so you're stuck with your face between her buttocks then she stands up and starts walking randomly and every step she takes farts then after five minutes she has exhausted almost all the gas and she was also tired of walking, she lets you breathe clean air after you've freed herself she tells you

M: hey Thomas since today is my birthday I was thinking of making my special soup and some chilli, what do you think?

You were too dazzy and tired to answer her

M: ah so it's an ok because whoever is silent consents

Mary goes to the kitchen to prepare the food after about three hours it's ready and calls you to the table, you arrive and start eating.

You had almost finished your plate of chilli when Aunt Mary gets up and goes to get something from the pantry it was chili powder then she takes your plate she puts some chili mixes your chilli and brings her hand closer to give you the plate but then she immediately pulls it back and brings it closer to her ass she puts your plate around her ass with direct access to her asshole that points towards your plate and releases three atomic bombs of flatulence on your chilli then she gives you the plate and you He says with an authoritarian tone

M: Thomas if you don't eat all that chilli (you missed a little more than half of it) those farts that looked like atomic bombs you get them all in your nose and in your mouth, understand?

T:......Mh......... ok.........

You take some and put it in your mouth

The taste is nauseating it seems like eating shit, after 30 minutes you manage to finish the meal and go to the bathroom to do your needs after your aunt calls you and tells you to go to the living room you go and she asks you if you want to see a movie.

You accept and choose the movie in the end you choose to watch Titanic since you haven't watched it since you were 6 years old and your aunt liked it.

After about ten minutes your aunt farts loudly, long, wet and smelly then she tells you

M: Thomas go under the blanket and smell that fart that stinks so much.

You do it you lift the blanket and you immediately get a gust of harmful gas but you keep getting closer to her stinky ass and the closer you get the more the stench intensifies shortly after you finish smelling and take your head out from under the covers and continue watching the movie, about at the end your aunt farts again and where to go get her.

For dinner your aunt had said she wouldn't feel like cooking so we would eat the chilli left over for lunch, after she finished saying her sentence you got up and went to that pillow to drink a glass of water while you were drinking your glass of water you came up with an idea to take revenge a little for what your aunt is making you go through so put some Tabasco and chili in the chilli shortly after your Aunt arrived and implanted the dishes and while she was plating the dishes you told her not to You were very hungry so you didn't want much chilli then your aunt jokingly said

M: is that why I made your chilli today at lunch? Hahahaha.

And he starts laughing

Then you saying in a low voice that it wasn't for that reason and you start eating your aunt eats a teaspoon of her plate and immediately looks for water as soon as she manages to send it down she tells you

M: THOMAS! DID YOU HAPPEN TO PUT SPICY IN THIS CHILLI?

T: yes aunt I thought it suited us.

You don't have problems with spicy since you usually eat it but your aunt doesn't

M: then come go straight to my room!

After about an hour you go to Aunt Mary's room and as soon as you open the door your first vision is her ass without pants and underwear, she is standing with her ass in the air and turning her back on you while looking for something in her drawer, then close the door and she tells you

M: oh but look who came to honor his mistress.

Immediately after with an authoritarian tone he tells you

M: go straight to your place (the one where you slept the first night). Pointing to the hole in the mattress.

You get in and your aunt immediately puts her asshole against your nose and we start a series of farts of all kinds and after half an hour of continuous farts she tells you

M: so you learn to put spice in my food!

And the farts start again

But you can't resist and go K.O

This is my usual diet in one day:


In the morning: 2 eggs with ham and a cup of coffee

At noon: (This meal varies depending on the day of the week) It can be a pork chop or ground beef with potatoes, salad, or something else. 

Additionally, I have 2 breaks at work in the afternoon where I eat 2 bean burritos with orange juice (No sugar)

I eat no junk food, soda, I take care of my sugar intake, and try to drink at least 2 lts of water, is it just my digestive system being slower? 

I don't know it's its important but I recovered from a hard salmonella infection in April last year, and took probiotics for one month past October.

Grace was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 26 birthday growing up in a small town with a big city feel to her. But to Grace it was her home but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city as she would ride her bike through towns streets. 

Weaving in and out of cars passing by them feeling free from the world around her feeling the wind blowing wildly through her long brown hair. Racing with excitement with her smile saying it all as she rode through the town passing by people as some would wave as she passed by

With the feeling of nothing could stop this girl from Trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement mainly it was just them watching out for her own safety. Grace was just your typical young green eyed girl who liked her shredded jeans tee shirt and hoodie living her life her way. 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets. She would often ride her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape she even had a name for her bike she would often call it Quicksilver. 

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Grace needed it be. For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go forever dodging in and out of front of cars. As always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Grace was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life. More then often finding herself thinking about her life For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life  it felt as if she was living someone else’s life other then her own. 

But for now it was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked often finding herself dreaming of life on her own on her bike.

Often finding herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride  a trial that she was at the moment making her way through it  gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Grace found herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she grew up in. 

The locals would refer to it as Angels Ravine For to anyone standing there could lookout over into the valley ahead.It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself. It was a quit place it was her place where she would come to often. To relax, to think about her life thinking about her life growing up she didn’t have any family or many friends. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself  with Grace finding that herLife was there in the mountains with her bike outside of her hometown. But as the day grew long with Grace setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Grace loved riding at night under a starlit sky being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky for she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought. But she also had a light that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of her thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s.That night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“if I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself while also thinking to herself who else would she tell. For oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her in her Life with no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

The always the same girl but in different places but never where Grace was never in the town that she grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams came they went as Grace found herself

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Grace rushed out of her front door holding her bike knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets her usual weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Grace that was her Life on her bike loose and fast racing with the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails telling passerby’s of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Grace herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like it was her own little Heaven but this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster then normally having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. But this time was different this day she was just enjoying a nice quiet ride in the mountains. 

As she came to the ravine Grace then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunsets Grace had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with a few words but just looking out into it, It was if time itself was coming to an end. Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Grace began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would they be liked for as far back as Grace could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she woke up being in a place with people around her. But not as family just people in her life a life that seemingly has went by all too fast with the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Grace set there enjoying it as the last of its light then disappeared behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Grace laid there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. laying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. The same dream as well as the same girl the girl that Grace would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be another demission from what seemed to be another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her but everything around her was different, different in the way she lived From the town that she lived in. But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said in the dream a name that was name of the girl in her dreams someone in the dream called her Chloe. 

Suddenly waking up to the morning light putting her hands up to her head. Grace just set there stunned thinking to herself on how real that dream was for unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there I was her. Still visibly shaken as Grace looked around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Grace began to scream a calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “ hello Grace it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Grace, Grace then replied with 

“ then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” “ 

I know all about you Grace, I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Grace then replying “ answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Grace your dreams.” 

As Grace just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Grace just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“ it is you Grace and it is not.” 

More confused then ever Grace just replied by saying 

“ me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Grace standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life. 
But now in this Life you are her and she is not and you are not. For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Grace then replying 

“ is this Heaven then and are you a Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Grace! And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Grace

 “ the dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now and what is to come for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have now go and Live your Life Grace for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Grace. Standing there looking out over Angels Ravine Grace couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then memories of her dreams of the girl was now fading slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come a Life of whatever was to come for Grace. 

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now it was her town her home her Life. With Grace now leaving Angels Ravine making her way home finding her usual self racing to beat her own best time.

Grace finding herself making her way through once more through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. She was going to ride into Life into her Life Living a Life of what she made it.

1iidohq,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1iidohq/odk_computer_desk_large_office_desk_48_inch/,ODK Computer Desk Large Office Desk 48 Inch review with modern white marble design,"Having spent a few months with the ODK Computer Desk Large Office Desk, model XSD-XFZ, I can confidently share my experience. This desk has been a staple in my home office, used almost daily for both work and personal projects. While it does a lot of things right, there are some quirks that are worth pointing out.

**DESIGN & BUILD QUALITY**

The ODK Computer Desk immediately stands out with its sleek white marble desktop paired with gold legs. This combination exudes a modern and minimalist vibe that fits well in various settings, from home offices to bedrooms. The top is made of engineered wood, which is both scratch-resistant and waterproof—a blessing for someone like me who occasionally spills coffee! However, while the desktop feels solid, the metal legs are thinner than I expected. They do hold up, but there’s a slight wobble if you apply too much pressure. For a desk in this price range, that’s not entirely surprising, but it’s something to consider if stability is a top priority.

[Check if ODK Computer Desk is on sale on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product-reviews/odk-computer-desk-review-model-48-inch-b0bvqk2d62/)

**SIZE & SPACE**

With dimensions of 18.9""D x 47.2""W x 28.9""H, this desk is compact enough for smaller spaces yet spacious enough to handle essentials. I comfortably fit my 27-inch monitor, a laptop, and a few desk accessories like a lamp and a cup holder. However, when I tried adding a second monitor, things started to feel a bit cramped. For single-monitor setups or lightweight use, the desk shines, but dual-monitor users might need to get creative with monitor arms or stands. My colleague, who also owns this desk, uses it in her kid's room, and it fits perfectly as a study table.

**FUNCTIONALITY & FEATURES**

The desk includes some thoughtful features. The side-mounted storage bag is handy for keeping notebooks, planners, or even a stack of mail in one place. On the opposite side, a headphone hook proves surprisingly useful. I hang my headphones on it when not in use, and it keeps the desk clutter-free. Both of these features are detachable, so you can choose which side you want them on. However, I’m not a huge fan of the fabric color for the storage bag—it’s a dark gray, which feels a bit mismatched with the white-and-gold aesthetic. A lighter or more complementary color would have been a better choice.

**ASSEMBLY**

Assembly was straightforward. The instructions were clear, and all the tools needed were included. I managed to put it together solo in about 30 minutes. That said, the manufacturer recommends two people for assembly, which could make it even quicker and easier. Compared to some other flat-pack furniture I’ve tackled, this was a breeze. One thing I appreciated was the inclusion of extra screws—something more manufacturers should do.

**PROS**

* Attractive white marble and gold design enhances any room.
* Scratch-resistant and waterproof desktop is practical for everyday use.
* Compact size, yet sufficient for single-monitor setups.
* Handy headphone hook and storage bag add functional value.
* Straightforward assembly with clear instructions and extra screws.

**CONS**

* Slight wobble due to thinner metal legs.
* Storage bag’s dark gray fabric clashes with the desk’s white-and-gold theme.
* Limited space for dual-monitor setups without adjustments.
* Maximum weight capacity of 50 kilograms might not suit all users.
* No finished back, so it’s best placed against a wall.

**COMPARISON TO COMPETITORS**

When comparing the ODK Computer Desk to other desks in its category, such as the SHW Home Office 48-Inch Desk or the CubiCubi Modern Computer Desk, it holds up well in terms of aesthetics. The SHW desk has a similar price point but lacks the premium look of the marble and gold finish. On the other hand, the CubiCubi desk offers more storage options, including shelves, but sacrifices the sleek, minimalist design that the ODK desk provides.

For stability, I found the SHW desk slightly sturdier, likely due to its thicker legs. However, the ODK desk wins in ease of assembly—no complicated diagrams or missing parts here. If you’re after a desk that blends design with functionality, the ODK desk edges out its competitors, though the others might be better suited for heavy-duty use or more storage needs.

**COST ANALYSIS AND VALUE FOR MONEY**

The price of the ODK Computer Desk is very competitive, especially for a desk that looks this good. You’re paying for both form and function, and while it’s not perfect, it’s a solid option for those on a budget who still want a touch of elegance in their workspace. It’s not going to replace high-end desks, but it does offer good value for what it is. If you’re someone who needs a desk for light to moderate use, this is a worthwhile purchase.

**FEATURES IN EVERYDAY USE**

Using the ODK desk daily, I’ve tested its features thoroughly. The waterproof surface is great for avoiding coffee rings, and the scratch resistance has held up against my habit of scribbling notes without a pad. The headphone hook keeps my headphones safe and accessible, while the storage bag reduces clutter. The desk is also lightweight, making it easy to reposition if needed. However, as mentioned, heavier setups might push its limits.

Overall, the ODK Computer Desk delivers on its promises, offering a stylish workspace for those who prioritize design and functionality. It’s not without its flaws, but for its price range, it’s a solid contender.",1,1738772104.0,GameTableCentral,0,1.0,False
