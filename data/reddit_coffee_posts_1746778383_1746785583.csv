1kiewto,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1kiewto/struggling_to_stay_disciplined_with_morning/,struggling to stay disciplined with morning workouts,"Hey everyone, I’m reaching out because I could use some support. I used to work out four times a week in the morning before work, and it made me feel great, focused, strong, and aligned with my goals.

My mornings have a solid structure: 
I wake up at 6, take my dog for a walk, drink coffee and eat a light breakfast, and I should start training by 7:15. 
But lately, I’ve been struggling to push myself to begin on time. 
I love training, and it really matters to me. I’m working toward specific skills, and missing workouts slows down my progress.
I’ve tried using alarm clocks, and it didn’t worked.

The morning is the only time I can realistically train, so skipping or starting late usually means not finishing/not working out at all. I’m worried that I’m slipping out of the habit, and I don’t want that.

If you’ve ever been in a similar place, how did you bring back your discipline? Any routines, habits, or mindset shifts that helped you show up consistently even when motivation was low?

Thanks in advance.",1,1746785444.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

1kieweo,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1kieweo/my_favorite_monologue_from_my_first_novel_the/,"My favorite monologue from my first Novel "" The Station 13 ""","Now I’m going to my favorite conversation — the first one between Carl and the Narrator.

The story of this scene takes place on the night Amy dies.
Carl walks to Station 13 — wearing the clothes soaked in Amy’s blood . The monologue starts :

The Narrator left, so I’ll be your voice here.
You know, you should get used to that.
Sorry I didn’t introduce myself.
I’m the writer.
Yeah… that one. The name on the cover.
I’ll keep this simple — no flourishes.
Carl goes to Station 13.
The place where he saw his beloved for the first time.
He sits on the same bench.
The bench that, no matter how you look at it, is always Bench 13 of the Station.
Symbolic, isn’t it?
But hey, I didn’t write it — I’m just reading what’s already there.
He sits on that bench and cries.
It’s past midnight.
No stars.
Even the stars were too afraid to watch Carl cry.

Suddenly, the air gets cold.
A man approaches from the distance, though you can’t see him clearly at first.
He gets closer, and now —
Wait. That man…
Damn him.
Sorry, I shouldn’t say anything yet.

He’s wearing a long gray coat and a matching gray hat.
Brown pants and shoes.
The hat’s pulled down just enough to hide his face,
but that bitter smile — that you can see.

He sits next to Carl.
Takes out a cigarette from a pack and says:

""Want one?""

Carl doesn’t respond.
Just lowers his head to decline.

The man says:

""No cigarettes, no whiskey… not even a proper curse unless Walter’s yelling in your ear.
Even when you want to make a decision, you only think for five minutes!
You’re amazing, Carl.""

Carl looks at him, shocked.

Carl: “You… how do you know all that? Tell me the truth!”
Narrator: “Truth is bitter. That’s why most people take their coffee with sugar… and their lives with lies.”

""You know Carl, you and I…
we’re similar.
But maybe…
maybe it’s just fate that has a problem with us.""

Carl: “You… who are you?”

Narrator: “Who am I? That’s funny — no one’s ever asked.”
Carl (angrily): “Answer me!”
Narrator: “Easy, boy, easy.
You know… I forgot who I used to be.
But now — they call me The Narrator.
My friends call me that.
I tell stories.
Your story… is different.”

Carl: “You… have friends?”
Narrator: “Yeah.
A few concepts.
And the graves of people whose stories I’ve already told.”

Carl lowers his head, afraid.
The Narrator speaks again:

""You know Carl, a coin has two sides —
one is victory, the other is defeat.
Victory means life.
Defeat means death.""

He tosses a coin in the air — but suddenly, it vanishes.

""You see, Carl…
I don’t even bother to check how the coin lands.
But you —
you really intrigue me.
Heads or tails?""

Carl: “The coin doesn’t decide for me.”

Narrator: “Alright… we’ll see.”

He tosses a coin — and it lands upright.
Not heads. Not tails. Just… standing.

Narrator: “Where I come from, this doesn’t happen.
Strange…
You know, Carl, even Fate is doubting you now —
even it has lost faith in you.
And I…
I love people who’ve lost their faith.”
“You used to have this spark in your eyes, but now…”

The Narrator points to Carl’s blood-soaked clothes.

“…Now we’re here.”

He pulls out Amy’s white scarf — now stained with blood.

Narrator: “Just five seconds.
That’s all it took, Carl.
Five seconds of distraction.”

Carl: “You… you…”

The Narrator laughs.

Narrator: “Don’t know what to say?
Yeah, sorry — no dialogue was written for you here.”

Carl: “I don’t care about dialogue.
I just want the truth.”

The Narrator pauses — surprised.

Narrator: “Wait… what did you just say?
You?
You never had anything to say.
You always surprise me.
But let me ask you something —
If you find the truth, what will you even do with it?
People chase it all their lives…
and when they finally find it,
they just stare at it.”

Carl stays silent.

Narrator: “You know Carl…
just five seconds.
You’ve always had a problem with time.”

The Narrator stands up.
A train whistle sounds in the distance.
The train arrives.
And as smoke fills the air, the Narrator vanishes into it —
but his voice remains:

“Whatever you choose, Carl…
I’ll be waiting.”

The train leaves.
And on the bench —
there’s a red lighter,
a cigarette pack labeled “5 Seconds,”
and a note:

“You know, Carl —
numbers are fate.
But no one looks at them that way.
Light a cigarette.
It’s not a sin.
At least not for people like us —
people who need to forget pain,
for just… an hour.”

Carl looks at it and says:

“Damn him.
He knew it all along.”

He lights a cigarette.

And yes — you guessed it right.

That was The Narrator.

2. Nd nagpupunas after gamitin ang equipment
3. Irerelocate ang bench to the cable machines or somewhere then hahayaan nlg at di isosoli sa original place (sa harap ng free weights)
4. Gagamit ng bench para lagyan ng bag,tumblr , selpon
5. Multiple equipment hoarder ,superset overlord

7. Nagkakalat ng used tissue, iiwan ng coffee cups, and bottled water
8. Nd binabalik yung pamunas sa common area (dinadala sa kung saan sila mag woworkout like personal use lg all throughout kahit pang members lahat)

1kiew43,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1kiew43/head_pressure_no_answers_and_too_many/,"Head Pressure, No Answers, and Too Many Interventions — What I Learned (the Hard Way)","Thought I would share this with the group here in case someone has similar headaches and considering IIH, leak or any intervention. 

**Headache onset (post viral - ER said Covid) - 01/23**

* 2 ER visits for intense headaches episodes- I thought I am having a stroke. CT scans-  migraine
* 4 moths in to it -  Head pressure almost daily. Vision Issues. 
* Headache specialist appointments
* **Multiple brain and spine scans**\- Negative
* Vision Tests including **Visual Field**\- Clear
* **Lumbar Puncture - Opening pressure 18**
* No diagnosis yet. constant suffering
* PCP wanted me to try Diamox because I found relief
* **Diamox (250 mg twice a day)** helped initially. I thought this is it
* Soon (2 weeks later), It failed to help and gave me **Orthostatic Hypotension (OH)**
* Cut down the dose to 1/4. slightly better. 
* **Repeated LP. Opening Pressure - 21**
* Possible IIH
* MRV- suspected stenosis 
* **DSA (Digital Subtraction Angiogram) - Clear**
* IIH diagnosis taken away 
* Repeated vIsion exam- Clear
* Back to Square One 
* Went down the CCI route- Pushed for **Neck flexion/ Extension MRI - Negative.** No issues there. 
* Met a Intervention Neurologist - **suspected csf leak**
* Went for **Epidural Blood Patch** \- More issues + horrible leg pain
* 1 month later- still not reached the baseline. Went on Notryptyline and pregabalin. Slight help. 
* 1.5 months later- took aspirin in desperation. Instant relief for 2 days. Stopped because didn't want to mess up anything further. 
* 2 months later- still not at the baseline. continuing notrytyline and pregabalin. Added low dose diamox- feeling rebound high pressure. Still no IIH diagnosis . Advised not to take aspirin.
* Did **CGRP** shot earlier this week. No effect yet
* My Neuro team is shocked and giving up

  


So - If you have headaches and head pressure and thinking about any of the underlying issues - IIH, leak, CCI, or something else - be careful , Because it's not always what you think. Covid headaches are a beast and doctors will try to find similarities with other headaches causes, these headaches and pressure symptoms do not align with any other headache disorders. Choose the less/no intervention route over anything invasive. 

**Complex condition now due to multiple intervention.**

I might have changed my headache characteristics because of all the above interventions and might have a complex condition now. I was, and still am desperate to find relief like everyone else here. However I learned to be more careful now, and I learned this the hard way. 

**Subs and Online groups for other chronic conditions-**

One thing I could tell you is that some people on other subs (FB groups) who have a confirmed certain condition (IIH, Leak or something else) will almost most of the time would convince you that you have a similar condition, without sharing their diagnosis path. More often than not, like 99% of the times, they get to a confirmed diagnosis with a simple scan- MRIs, eye scans ( with symptoms close to that condition ), where their doctors saw an evidence of an underlying condition and set them on the right path. This isn't the case with most of us here, and too much to testing/ intervention has extremely low yield in our case. I have also found some people on the other groups very helpful when it comes to understanding these conditions. They know so much more than my doctors (I bet you this would be true in most cases)

**All differential and conflicting diagnosis at times**

2+ year of diagnosis at different times: Cervocigenic headaches, IIH, Leak, chronic migraine, chronic tension headaches, sinusitis, intractable headaches, occipital neuralgia.

**What still helps:** Things which work to lower the pressure intensity even till date  - Extremely low dose diamox (62.5mg) once a day, coffee - its a hit or a miss - sometimes it numbs the pain - other times it makes the headaches worse, aspirin, NSAIDs, walking and moving - straight spine and better blood flow, not lying during the day, pregabalin, notryptyline, nicotine patch. ",1,1746785362.0,covidlonghaulers,1,1.0,False

1kietai,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaffeeWelt/comments/1kietai/warum_ist_die_philips_senseo_switch/,Warum ist die Philips Senseo Switch Kaffeemaschine ideal für Ihren Alltag?,"**Erster Eindruck und Design der Kaffeemaschine**

Die Philips HD6592/64 Senseo Switch Pad- und Filterkaffeemaschine hat bei mir gleich nach dem Auspacken einen hochwertigen Eindruck hinterlassen. Das glänzende Klavierlack-Schwarz verleiht der Maschine eine elegante, moderne Optik, die sich mühelos in jede Küche einfügt. Mit einer Größe von 46,6 x 24,2 x 32,4 cm nimmt die Kaffeemaschine nicht zu viel Platz weg, passt jedoch problemlos auf die Küchenarbeitsfläche – selbst bei einer kleineren Küche. Mein erster Gedanke war: ""Endlich ein Gerät, das nicht nur praktisch ist, sondern auch gut aussieht."" Die Verarbeitung wirkt solide, und das leichte Gewicht von 1,75 Kilogramm macht es leicht, sie bei Bedarf zu bewegen.

**Bedienung und Benutzerfreundlichkeit**

Die Bedienung dieses Geräts ist so einfach wie Kaffee trinken selbst! Die drei Tasten bieten klare Optionen: eine Tasse, zwei Tassen oder eine ganze Kanne Kaffee, die sich per Knopfdruck zubereiten lassen. Es gibt keine komplizierte Programmierung oder unnötigen Schnickschnack. Der abnehmbare 1-Liter-Wassertank ermöglicht das unkomplizierte Nachfüllen und ist besonders praktisch. Ich hatte keine Probleme, die Maschine in Betrieb zu nehmen – ich musste lediglich Wasser einfüllen, ein Senseo-Pad einsetzen, und voila, meine erste Tasse war in kürzester Zeit fertig. 

[Schon den Preis von Philips HD6592/64 bei Amazon gesehen? Klick hier.](https://kaffeechef.de/p/b0b1j59j1p/)

**Vielseitigkeit und Kaffeequalität**

Diese Maschine beeindruckt durch ihre Vielseitigkeit. Dank der 2-in-1-Brühtechnologie konnte ich sowohl Pads verwenden als auch Filterkaffee brühen. Es ist so praktisch, je nach Tageslaune oder Gästeanzahl zwischen Tasse und Kanne entscheiden zu können. Die Crema ist wirklich ein Highlight, insbesondere bei den Senseo-Pads. Der Filterkaffee hingegen, den ich mit der Edelstahl-Thermoskanne zubereitet habe, bleibt über Stunden schön warm und aromatisch. Diese Qualität hat mich mehrmals überrascht, besonders wenn ich morgens Kaffee gebrüht habe, der auch am Nachmittag noch schmeckte, als wäre er frisch aufgegossen.

**Positives**

- Brillante 2-in-1-Funktion für Pads und Filterkaffee  
- Einfach zu bedienen dank übersichtlicher Tasten  
- Edles und platzsparendes Design  
- Hervorragende Thermoskanne, die coffee-to-go überflüssig macht  
- Sehr gute Crema bei der Verwendung von Senseo-Pads  

**Leicht optimierbare Schwächen**

Trotz der vielen Vorteile hat die Maschine ein paar Aspekte, die nicht perfekt sind:  

- Beim Abnehmen des Wassertanks kann es leicht spritzen.  
- Der Platz unter dem Tassenhalter ist limitiert; große Tassen passen nur schwer darunter.  
- Die Lautstärke während des Brühvorgangs ist spürbar.

**Direkte Alternativen und Wettbewerber**

Verglichen mit Maschinen derselben Kategorie, wie der Bosch Tassimo Vivy 2 oder der Krups Nescafé Dolce Gusto Mini Me, sticht die Philips Senseo Switch durch ihre 2-in-1-Brautechnologie hervor. Die Konkurrenz fokussiert sich meist nur auf Pads oder kapselbasierte Systeme, wobei der Filterkaffee-Aspekt oft fehlt. Wobei ich aber sagen muss, dass die erwähnten Maschinen oft leiser sind, was sie für manche interessanter macht. Dafür punktet die Switch mit durchdachter Funktionalität und Flexibilität, die ich bei den Alternativen vermisst habe.

**Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis**

Das Preisgefühl bei der Philips Senseo Switch empfinde ich als angemessen, insbesondere für die Bereitschaft, zwei unterschiedliche Brüharten in einer Maschine zu kombinieren. Gerade für Haushalte, in denen man gerne zwischen Filterkaffee und Pad-Kaffee wechselt, ist sie eine clevere Investition. Im Vergleich zu anderen Geräten liefert sie ein gutes Gleichgewicht zwischen Kosten und Nutzen. Die Qualität und Funktionsvielfalt rechtfertigen durchaus den finanziellen Aufwand, und dazu kommt die Langlebigkeit, die ich bei Philips-Produkten allgemein gewohnt bin.

1kiepnx,https://thewire.in/communalism/anti-muslim-violence-indira-gandhi-narendra-modi,India: Did you know Indira Gandhi’s Government targeted Muslims for sterilisation in the 1970’s - ‘Authoritarianism and Anti-Muslim Violence: Comparing the Emergency to Today’,"
Similar to today, Muslims and Dalits were explicitly targeted by Indira Gandhi’s administration for physical elimination

Over the course of Narendra Modi’s political career, he has consistently persecuted Muslims for political gain. As chief minister of Gujarat, he stoked communal tensions that culminated in the 2002 genocide, for which he had been denied a US visa. Modi’s persecution of Indian Muslims continued after he was elected prime minister in 2014. Lynchings of Muslims and Dalits have become increasingly common across India since Modi’s election. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was passed in December 2019 and fears persist that it will be used to disenfranchise and revoke the citizenship of Muslims. 

Non-violent protests against the CAA led by students and activists were brutally suppressed by the police. In February 2020, Hindu mobs shot, stabbed and assaulted Muslims in North-East Delhi while the Delhi Police not only failed to intervene, but encouraged the violence. For these reasons, and others, commentators have termed the current political situation as an ‘undeclared Emergency’.

Theorists of authoritarianism generally concur that declaring an Emergency is the establishment of a legal civil war that allows for the physical elimination of not only political adversaries but entire categories of citizens who for some reason cannot be integrated into the political system. The Modi administration exemplifies this logic, both through its repression of adversaries, such as its brutal repression of the student movement, and through the physical elimination of Muslims in India through lynchings, disenfranchisement, revocation of citizenship and extra-legal detention camps. Modi’s persecution of Muslims is one of many reasons why observers have termed this period an undeclared Emergency, but many have also argued that the current situation is worse because the Emergency state of the 1970s did not explicitly target Muslims. Contrary to this view of the Emergency, in researching my book, Brewing Resistance: Indian Coffee House and the Emergency in Postcolonial India (Cambridge University Press, 2020), I found evidence that Muslims and Dalits were, in fact, explicitly targeted by Indira Gandhi’s administration for physical elimination. 

Forced sterilisations of Muslims

Developmental policy during the Emergency encouraged and provided increased access to vasectomy and tubectomy procedures to limit population growth. Among North Indians, the Emergency is referred to as nasbandi ki vaqt, reflecting just how pervasive this practice was. By way of example, I’ll illustrate two instances of how sterilisation drives were implemented.

Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh was the scene of a violent episode during the Emergency. After the Emergency was declared, sterilisation camps were opened across North India. In Uttar Pradesh alone, the sterilisation programme averaged 331 vasectomies per day in June 1975, 1,578 per day in July 1975, and 5,644 per day in August 1975. Police in Uttar Pradesh were ordered by district officials to round up peasants for forced sterilisation in order to help officials meet targets set by Sanjay Gandhi.

In Muzaffarnagar, a mob threw stones at a family planning clinic, outraged that unmarried young people without children were being forcibly sterilised alongside older, married people with children. In suppressing protests against the family planning programme in Muzaffarnagar, police killed 25 Muslim villagers. Police then also entered a mosque near the family planning camp where they shot and killed an additional three people inside the mosque. They then threw the victims of police shootings into a nearby river to conceal the fatalities.

In Uttawar, Haryana, state officials orchestrated a raid because the village had become a point of opposition to family planning. Villagers blocked family planning officials from entering the village, and in retaliation, the Haryana State Electricity Board cut power to the village from October 12 to 29, 1976 and again from November 5 to 13, 1976. In November 1976, 700 police entered the village armed with rifles and tear gas, forcing villagers into trucks. They were taken to a police station where they were interrogated, and 180 of the 550 detained Uttawar residents were placed under arrest and taken to family planning camps where they were forced to undergo sterilisation.

The Inspector General of Police claimed that the Haryana State Police believed that these villagers had smuggled weapons from Pakistan that they were intending to use in armed insurrection, but no weapons were ever recovered from the raid. One 70-year-old villager was one of the men forced to undergo vasectomy. He recounted that doctors initially refused to perform a vasectomy because of his age but then did so after the police and state revenue officials threatened doctors. Abdul Rehman, who was 25 years old, also pleaded with doctors not to perform a vasectomy surgery on him as he and his wife had only one child and wanted to have more. He stated that doctors initially refused to operate but then did perform a vasectomy under police threat.

P.N. Haksar, Indira Gandhi’s political advisor, informed her that Muslims and Dalits were explicitly targeted by the sterilisation programme for compulsory vasectomy and tubectomy. He expressed that this policy should be rethought in order to prevent civil unrest. In one confidential report Haksar writes, “Officials in UP and to a minor extent in Bengal have used compulsions to get people sterilised. I shall give instances of these compulsions later. These compulsions are creating a very unfavourable situation for the Government, at places leading to resistance against the Government and clashes with its law and order forces. The element of compulsion has to be eliminated if the Government decides to go in for elections because at least in UP the opposition parties can make this compulsion in sterilisation as their main plank of election propaganda and with its help obtain support from the poor and backward who are the victims mainly of such compulsions…. some of the villagers sterilised developed sepsis or got infected by tetanus in the environment in which they live. 

This results in deaths. The rumour of deaths from family planning operations spread very fast … Such reports and rumours have made the sterilisation programme quite unpopular in rural areas, often leading to organised resistance from villagers and ending in violent actions…. UP must be the state where the largest number of incidents have taken place over the villagers opposition to the sterilisation programme. Muslims as a whole have come out in opposition of sterilisation. …  It is mostly the poor who have been affected by the compulsion used by revenue officials in getting people sterilised and most of the poor are either Harijans or Muslims. The compulsion, which they have been subjected to, has led to resistance among them towards the family planning programme…. This opposition led to a number of violent actions. … villagers of Rankedih in Sultanpur resisted the police, which wanted to enter the village to investigate a case of some family planning workers being beaten up some days earlier. Villagers not only prevented police from entering the village, but also threw bricks at them. This led to police opening fire on the villagers, in which 9 persons were killed … In Aligarh one heard yet another kind of story about the compulsion used in the family planning drive. It was said that in July some people were arrested at the railway station for ticketless travelling. Then, all of them who were over 18 years of age were sent in for sterilisation while still under detention. As I stated earlier, in a rush operations are not performed properly and due to lack of after-care some people die as a result of sterilisation operations. 

A number of women have died after tubectomy operations. The deaths as a result of lack of after-care in family planning operations must at least be in a hundred in UP. This method of family planning is causing a very unfavourable situation for the Congress and the Government among the poorest sections of the people…. I cannot help repeating myself by saying that the family planning drive in UP is alienating a large number of poor people. If this goes on, the Congress runs the danger of losing support of Muslims, Harijans, and poor people.” While Haksar’s objective was to minimise the political fallout from these unpopular family planning policies and, as such, may understate the human toll of the family planning programme, it is proof that Indira Gandhi was aware that the sterilisation programme was targeting Muslims and Dalits and it nonetheless continued. This report demonstrates that compulsory sterilisations coupled with poor sanitation in rural areas, communalism and casteism created conditions under which forced sterilisation of Muslims and Dalits became prevalent. The Turkman Gate uprising In Old Delhi, Rukhsana Sultana oversaw the sterilisation programme. Sultana arranged police escorts for men going to and from the camp and enlisted police officers to recruit men for vasectomy. Many of these men when later interviewed by inquiry commissions said that because the police visibly supported the Family Planning Camp in their neighbourhood, they felt they had no choice but to undergo vasectomy. 

Three police officers – Jugrah Chand, Om Vir Singh and Mohammad Naqi – were responsible for most of the coerced sterilisations in the neighbourhood and received Rs 10 for each resident they ‘motivated’ to undergo sterilisation. Thirty-five men named one of these three officers as having coerced him into getting a vasectomy, and there are perhaps more who failed to come forward. Less than a week after the family planning camp opened, demolition squads, led by Sanjay Gandhi and the Delhi Municipal Corporation, came to bulldoze the neighbourhood for redevelopment and to relocate residents to the Eastern border of Delhi. 

Women, along with their children, stood in front of the bulldozers in order to prevent the destruction of their homes. Men later joined women and children in the protests. The Central Reserve Police Force was called in to disperse the crowd, and when protesters conducted their midday prayers, the police charged with lathis and tear gas. Protesters fought back, throwing stones at the police. When the crowd failed to disperse, police began killing protestors without repercussion. It was later revealed that Sanjay Gandhi had initiated the order to fire on protestors.

A curfew was instated, and after cutting power supplies to the neighbourhood, police forcibly entered homes, beat and arrested men, and raped women, often stealing their jewellery after assaulting them. Police resumed firing on protestors, targeting three areas: behind the Hamdard Dawakhana, a by-lane where ‘fierce stone throwing was going on’, and in front of the Turkman Gate police post. Then a group of police officers went to the Jama Masjid, tried to force their way inside, and began firing at a group of about 150 young men who were throwing stones at the police. While Delhi Police reports show 14 rounds of ammunition were fired, one inquiry commission concluded that up to 45 rounds were fired.

Many protestors were killed and 453 were arrested. Delhi Jail’s superintendent, S.K. Batra, stated that Muslim protestors who were detained for their involvement in the Turkman Gate Uprising were intentionally given worse treatment in jail compared to other political prisoners. They were placed in cells lined with asbestos so that the cells would become unbearably hot in the summer, while others were placed in the paagal chuki as a form of psychological torture. Many of those arrested for protesting at Turkman Gate died in Tihar Jail.

After police had suppressed the uprising, bulldozers worked through the night, reducing the neighbourhood to rubble by morning. About 800-900 houses were demolished overnight, and some were crushed to death in the rubble. The estimated death toll of this short-lived uprising ranges from 12 to 1,200. A journalist I conducted an oral history interview with told me that in the days after the uprising, “We actually saw some funeral processions coming to the graveyard which was directly behind the Indian Express building. It was a Muslim graveyard and most of them were shot and killed. So you would notice things like that but it was very frustrating that you saw things but you couldn’t actually report on it [because of media censorship].”

In countless documents, police, city officials and others, repeated that the fervent sterilisation drives, the demolition operations, and police violence in the Delhi’s walled city had been taken up with political motives and “with a view to teach the Muslims”.

Conclusions 
When we compare contemporary violence against Muslims to the Emergency, there are far more similarities than commentators acknowledge. Collective memory has forgotten how brutal the Emergency was, especially for Muslims and Dalits. Today we hear of government officials being fired for not revoking the citizenship of a sufficient number of Muslims, but during the Emergency, officials were fired or faced consequences for not ‘motivating’ enough Muslims to undergo vasectomy. In 2019-20 we watched the Delhi Police violently suppress student protests against the CAA in Jamia Millia Islamia university. The attack on Jamia is reminiscent of the police violence at Turkman Gate in 1976. Both uprisings were led by Delhi’s Muslims to resist their elimination at the hands of the Indian state and both were violently suppressed by the Delhi Police. These are movements for survival against an authoritarian state that aims to eliminate Indian Muslims.

The lessons of the Emergency are not solely for India to learn, however. Across the globe we are witnessing a resurgence in authoritarian rule that targets political adversaries and categories of citizens who for some reason cannot be integrated into the political system. Modi’s alignment with US President Donald Trump’s white nationalist agenda and Trump’s alignment with Hindu nationalism shows how the leaders of contemporary authoritarian states are working together and learning from each other how to effectively suppress their domestic adversaries and target marginalised groups in order to stoke their base and maintain power.

This is not an Indian story, unfortunately, it is a global one. The lessons of India’s Emergency, and the movement against it as detailed and analysed in my new book, therefore, offer important strategies and tactics for movements against authoritarian states across the globe to resist the persecution of members of groups targeted by contemporary authoritarianism.

1kiepbu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kiepbu,Maybe I should move quadrants,"Hi everyone! 
So I made a post a while ago saying I was about to try LU logic 
So I did and I came to the conclusion that maybe I should change things up in terms of quadrants 

Outfit 1: the most recent outfit with a new blouse. I was doing my morning run just before and discovered a new park in my city. I was inspired by the wild flowers and the beginning of the outdoor season so I chose to repeat the wildflower team and add denim + sneakers to evoke the practicality and freedom of outdoorsy people

Outfit 2: I was going to spend the night in a country castle with my boyfriend so I wanted an ingenue dress with still a natural feel. But we didn't now that the dinner was shared with every castle resident and some of them were *very* bourgeois, two of them were royalists so I felt costumy. I wished I wore something more elegant!

Outfit 3: my birthday outfit! With a party and joyful sweater! I chose the dress to be a bit more elegant and womanly

Outfit 4: the day after my birthday, I was seeing one of my friend's thesis and dining in a chic restaurant in the evening so I still wanted to be chic but I toned it down as my friand was the centre of attention

Outfit 5: it was a regular day working at uni  but I was extra happy to have accidentally have dressed as an old timey professor 
But my god I should have changer socks and have better hair

Outfit 6: I was about to see a friend for coffee. I knew she was stressed about her appartment so I chose a cosy sweater in a soft and reassuring blue

Sometimes I feel like I should have two entirely different wardrobes for my lecture days and my work days, but in the end I think I feel more at ease when I am in harmony with my surroundings

I'm about to order an X5 50e in M sport package trim with the 915M style of wheels.   
Interior will be comfort seats in Merino Coffee.

I can't make up my mind which color to get.   
I was hoping some current owners could give some insight on the ownership experience. What is the color like under different conditions? How does it age? Do you get bored of it? Any experience on how it matches with coffee interior in real life?   

Options:   
\- Manhattan Green with black grill: I love the color, but I fear I might get bored of it pretty quickly. Almost every X5 around here is in Manhattan Green.  
\- Carbon Black with silver grill: I love the contrast with a silver grill, but I fear the color showing excessive swirl marks. Is the blue tone actually worse than an actual black car? I've owned black cars multiple times before, and always wash them by hand.  
\- Skyscraper Grey with black grill: I fear the contrast with the black grill and black lower bumper might be too much. Makes the front look very heavy on pictures. 

Thanks for any input.   
Pictures are of course very welcome.

not in voice,
but in the way I carried what no one clapped for.

I made peace in the silence
while she made noise in the chaos.
She cried in public,
I bled in private.
And when the house shook with her footsteps,
my heart flinched like a dog who knew
that love, too, could come stomping.

She said, “My mood depends on yours.”
What she meant was:
“Swallow your grief so I don’t have to taste mine.”
And I did.
Until I couldn’t.

I gave space.
She filled it with hurt.
I gave patience.
She called it control.
And when I asked for breath,
she told the world I had suffocated her.

She carried no fault—
only stories.
Bent facts into pity,
twisted memory into defense,
and wore victimhood like a wedding veil.

I taught her how to steer the roads,
paid for her schooling, pushed for her networking,
held up her future with hands blistered from holding us together.
She took the keys,
the credit,
and the narrative.
All I took was the blame.

But I was not faultless.
There were days the weight turned sharp in my mouth,
and I spoke from the wound, not the wisdom.
Anger spilled where gentleness should’ve stood.
Yet I did not run from the mirror—
I met it.
Owned it.
Worked the jagged edges down with quiet effort,
not just apologies,
but change.

Yes, my voice was loud—
they all heard the thunder when I broke.
But no one noticed the storm that built it:
the slow, relentless drip of blame,
the sideways glances laced with doubt,
the truths twisted just enough to sting.
Tiny betrayals,
soft as whispers,
repeated until they hollowed out my restraint.
And when I finally shattered,
they pointed at the sound—
never the silence that broke me.

She gave nothing freely,
but swore she gave everything.
I gave everything freely,
but she swore it was nothing.

And now they say I walked away.
But I didn’t walk.
I crawled out from under a weight I never agreed to carry.

There were moments—
a dance by a bonfire, soaked in woodsmoke and relief,
where guilt melted into laughter,
and we disappeared into each other beneath the hush of wet pine and soft night.
There were coffee shops on Saturdays,
board games in canvas tents,
her cooking steamed like memory,
our shopping synced like instinct.
For a while, it worked.
For a while, it felt like a life.
And that, too, is part of the story.

She’ll tell it simply—
a sad story in one sentence.
I was angry, She endured.
And the world, trained to trust the tearful,
won’t ask what came before the storm.

She and her family
will spin silence into guilt
like Rumplestiltskin with straw—
turning absence into accusation,
until the lie gleams like truth.

She’ll thrive in a world that only sees headlines.
I’ll rebuild in one that knows what it means
to live without applause.

No gods came to stop this.
No dharma intervened.
But maybe that’s the lesson—
not every fire is meant to be put out.
Some are meant to burn down the lie.

So here I stand.
Not bitter.
But awake.
Not victorious.
But finally free.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The key to successfully incorporating 1920s decor lies in understanding the defining features of the era's design principles. These features encompass everything from the color palettes and materials used to the specific patterns and furniture styles that were popular during this time.

**Geometric Patterns:** Intricate geometric patterns are a hallmark of the Art Deco movement, which heavily influenced 1920s home decor. These patterns, often featuring chevrons, zigzags, and stylized floral motifs, add a sense of visual interest and sophistication to any room. They can be incorporated through wallpaper, rugs, textiles, and even decorative accents like mirrors and picture frames.

**Luxurious Materials:** The Roaring Twenties were an era of opulence, and this is reflected in the materials used in home decor. Think rich velvets, shimmering silks, polished chrome, and exotic woods like ebony and walnut. These materials exude a sense of luxury and sophistication, instantly elevating the look and feel of a space. Incorporating these materials through furniture upholstery, draperies, and accessories can truly capture the essence of the 1920s.

**Mirrored Surfaces:** Mirrors were used extensively in 1920s decor to create a sense of spaciousness and glamour. Mirrored furniture, such as vanities, side tables, and even entire walls, were popular choices. These mirrored surfaces reflect light, making rooms appear brighter and more open, while also adding a touch of Art Deco flair. Consider incorporating a large, ornate mirror in your living room or bedroom to create a focal point and enhance the overall aesthetic.

**Bold Color Palettes:** While neutral colors like beige and cream were often used as a base, 1920s decor also incorporated bold pops of color. Jewel tones like emerald green, sapphire blue, and ruby red were frequently used to add drama and sophistication. Metallic accents, such as gold and silver, were also popular choices for adding a touch of glamour. Experiment with these colors in your paint choices, furniture upholstery, and decorative accessories to create a vibrant and authentic 1920s-inspired space.

**Streamlined Furniture:** The furniture of the 1920s reflected the Art Deco aesthetic, featuring clean lines, geometric shapes, and luxurious materials. Sofas and chairs often had rounded edges and were upholstered in velvet or silk. Side tables and coffee tables were typically made of wood or chrome and featured geometric designs. Look for furniture pieces that embody these characteristics to create an authentic 1920s look.

**Statement Lighting:** Lighting played a crucial role in 1920s home decor, with statement chandeliers and sconces serving as focal points in many rooms. These fixtures often featured geometric designs, frosted glass, and metallic accents. Consider incorporating a vintage-inspired chandelier in your dining room or a pair of Art Deco sconces in your living room to add a touch of glamour and sophistication.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best 2 chair patio sets combine durability, comfort, and style to create an inviting outdoor space.

**Weather-Resistant Materials:** High-quality patio sets utilize materials designed to withstand the elements. Aluminum frames are rust-proof and lightweight, while wicker sets often use resin-based materials that resist fading, cracking, and moisture damage. Teak wood is naturally weather-resistant due to its high oil content, making it a durable option for outdoor furniture.

**Comfortable Seating:** Ergonomically designed chairs with supportive backrests and comfortable cushions enhance the overall relaxation experience. Cushions made from weather-resistant fabrics like Sunbrella are ideal for outdoor use, as they resist fading, mildew, and water damage. The depth and width of the seats should accommodate various body types, ensuring comfortable seating for extended periods.

**Space-Saving Design:** Many 2 chair patio sets are designed with smaller spaces in mind. Folding chairs and tables are available for easy storage when not in use, while compact designs maximize the use of limited patio or balcony space. Some sets even include stackable chairs for convenient storage.

**Stylish Aesthetics:** Patio sets come in a variety of styles to complement different outdoor decors. From modern and minimalist designs to classic and traditional styles, there's a patio set to suit every taste. The color and finish of the furniture should coordinate with the surrounding environment, creating a cohesive and inviting outdoor space.

**Durable Construction:** A sturdy frame and high-quality materials are essential for ensuring the longevity of a patio set.

 ## FAQs Section

Common questions about 2 chair patio sets answered.

**What materials are best for a 2 chair patio set in a humid climate?**
  Aluminum, teak, and resin wicker are excellent choices for humid climates. Aluminum is rust-proof, teak is naturally resistant to moisture and decay, and resin wicker is designed to withstand the elements without fading or cracking. Avoid steel frames, as they can rust over time in humid conditions.

**How do I clean and maintain my 2 chair patio set?**
  Regular cleaning with mild soap and water is typically sufficient for most patio sets. For aluminum frames, use a soft cloth or brush to remove dirt and debris. Teak furniture can be cleaned with a teak cleaner and protectant to maintain its natural color and prevent weathering. Resin wicker can be hosed down and scrubbed with a soft brush. Cushions should be cleaned according to the manufacturer's instructions.

**What size patio or balcony is ideal for a 2 chair patio set?**
  A 2 chair patio set can fit comfortably on a small balcony or patio. A space of at least 6 feet by 6 feet is generally sufficient to accommodate a small table and two chairs with enough room to move around. Measure your space carefully before purchasing a set to ensure it fits comfortably.

Bad. Very bad.

Visually, the roast was already a red flag—some beans pale and underdeveloped, others dripping oil like they just ran a marathon. No consistency. No control. Just chaos. I should’ve stopped there.

But no—I brewed it.

And what did it taste like?

Roasted peanut shells. Not peanuts. The SHELLS.
Dry, papery, weirdly bitter with a dusty aftertaste. It was like my coffee got swapped with trail mix leftovers. Absolutely no depth, no clarity, and definitely none of that sweetness or brightness you expect even from a halfway-decent roast. Just…sadness.

1kieg2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1kieg2i/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

**Reader advisory:**

You’ll find plenty of straightforward, pastel-filtered motivational videos on TikTok — this isn’t one of them. This isn’t a five-step guide to happiness or something you’d pin on a vision board. It’s not even meant to inspire. It’s just honest. The purpose of this is for me to express my truth — and for you, maybe, to reflect on yours. If it helps, I’m grateful. If it echoes in you, that’s enough. And above all, I wish you peace of mind.



**Main text:**

I woke up before the alarm could sing its second verse. Counted down—five, four, three, two, one—and stood up, instead of negotiating for nine more minutes. I learned that trick from Mel Robbins—it’s supposed to short-circuit overthinking. Weirdly, it works.

I drank a full glass of water before even thinking about coffee. I read somewhere, like Harvard Health Review, maybe?—that we lose a surprising amount of water overnight just from breathing. That always stuck with me. Then I opened the curtains and stood still for a minute, letting daylight hit my eyes. Apparently, your brain starts syncing its internal clock the second it registers natural light. As Andrew Huberman says, it resets your mood and energy—and honestly, it feels true.

I did my usual routine—makeup like a ritual, SPF to armor the skin, black top, denim skirt, sandals. Black is my favorite. It’s not vanity—it’s readiness. I finished with my perfect perfume. I felt beautiful.

Then I packed my green leather bag with surgical precision: laptop, notebook, pen pouch, everything pouch. I have this system—essentials that must be in place or I feel like I can’t function. Most of the time, I’m right. It’s not just habit—it’s mental scaffolding.

Breakfast is a stabilizer. Greek yogurt, chia, berries, oats. A bit of cinnamon. The kind of meal that doesn’t hijack my blood sugar or leave me crashing at noon. I read about the second-meal effect—it’s real.

As I eat, I allow myself exactly ten minutes of news.  One curated list on X: economics, cats, politics, what’s happening in France, cats and dogs, what’s happening back home, cats and animals.

I sat on the edge of the bed, still glowing from my little routine, and tried to decide where to go. Library? Café nearby? Maybe eat and write? I’ve got a podcast deadline tomorrow, and a research presentation Thursday.

And yet, even the most intentional days can’t always hold back what the night forgets to bury.



Then it hit me. That delayed wave of anxious thoughts—you know the kind. The ones that wait for morning to show their face. Yesterday, at a gathering, someone said something. At the time, it slid past me—harmless, I thought. But this morning, it landed. The tone. The way others reacted.

It takes so little, really—just a flicker in the tone, a glance, the memory of something unresolved—for the whole wave to return.

And now that I’m putting this into words—and maybe into your ears—it hits harder.

It’s not strangers. It’s not everyone. It’s the ones I let in.

Too many questions. Not enough answers.

 The thoughts hit like a wall.  I couldn’t leave. I couldn’t even move. Tears came out of nowhere.

It was that kind of awareness that shows up late—uninvited, heavy. I wish it came earlier. But it never does.

We all carry unresolved things. Some of us turn them inward. Some of us take them out on others. Neither path leads to healing.

We all cause damage. But the damage we do to ourselves? That’s the one we fear most. Maybe that’s why, for most people, it’s never even an option.

But when too many people carry the same weight without ever facing it, it grows into something else. A culture, almost—where tenderness feels unsafe, cruelty gets laughs, and real connection is replaced by performance.

So I wish them real happiness. The kind that softens you, not hardens you. If more people felt whole inside, maybe we wouldn’t see so much of this ugliness on the outside.

And so we project. Online. In public. In quiet, curated posts.

 Awareness—once a path inward—has become a mirror we hold up to everyone else.

Even self-awareness, once a compass, can become a spinning wheel.

After a series of sudden, unfortunate thoughts, life still goes on—eventually. I had to carry these melancholic thoughts somewhere before starting work. And so, as a ritual, I found myself once again on that quiet bench, deep in the forest, where the leaves whispered secrets and the wind rustled like breath. This was my place. It had always been. And like the French say: on ne change pas une équipe qui gagne.When something works, you don’t change it.

It had inspired me. Calmed my mind.Helped me see patterns that once felt flou. It softened the noise. Helped me drop into myself—into the quieter, deeper layers. It made space for emotion without panic. It let me be, without fear.

Just like before, it was where I came to think—to untangle the knots in my mind, to make sense of the chaos. But as with everything in this world, there is a threshold you’re not meant to cross.

And this time, the quiet pressed differently. Heavier. As if the weight of a thousand borrowed voices clung to my skin.The forest, once a refuge, now mirrored the tangle inside me—too much knowing, too much feeling, too many open tabs in my mind.

It all started with a dog.

A grey pitbull—odd-looking, almost terrifying at first glance. Wide mouth, muscular frame, the kind of dog people cross the street to avoid. But then he trotted toward me, goofy as hell, tail flailing, carrying the energy of a clumsy toddler. You’d want to hug him. Maybe even protect him.

His owner? Strange in his own right. Wavy dark hair, heavy-lidded eyes that always meet mine for just a second too long. Every day he passes by, says Bonjour with that half-smile, half-dare look. And like a reflex, I say Bonjour back—eyes lowered, fingers already back on my notebook. It’s a dance we both seem to know.

But today, he sat next to me, without asking. Headphones blasting something unrecognizable—aggressive, maybe techno. I didn’t flinch. I just watched the dog.

He had found a branch—no, a whole limb of a tree, too big for his jaw, but he wrestled it anyway. Proud, focused, in that glorious trance dogs get into when they’ve found their thing. For fifteen minutes, he played. Unbothered. Joyful.

Then, without warning, the man stood and yanked the branch from the dog’s mouth. Not playfully. Not gently. He struggled with it. Aggressively. Then he gave up and walked away.

The dog froze. Branch still in his mouth. His body stiffened, like someone had pulled a string through his spine. His tail—once a metronome of joy—now stood orthogonal to the ground, straight as steel.

And I knew what that meant. Not just because I understood dogs. But I’ve seen this before—in books, in people, in myself.

That moment of hesitation. Of joy interrupted.

Wait. What just happened?

Was I wrong to be happy?

Should I stop?

I didn’t need to have a dog to know what that moment meant. Just like we don’t need to live a trauma to feel the echo of it—repackaged into a carousel post, subtitled and softly lit for Instagram.

At some point, awareness became content. We scroll through diagnoses like headlines. Swipe past self-help mantras. Like. Save. Share.

We’ve trained ourselves to read every twitch, every sigh, every nervous laugh. And in doing so, we’ve trained our brains to never rest. Always analyzing. Always asking, What does this mean about me?

We are dogs dropping the branch, picking it up, and following—

not because we understand,

but because we’ve been told what it means.



In the early days, it felt like we were all on a journey of discovery—like a pocket-sized documentary of the human spirit. A carnival for the curious. For the caring. For the ones who needed to know why.

We wandered, wide-eyed. We relished the thrill of uncovering hidden truths—about ourselves, about others, about the fin fond du monde.

And it felt empowering. To give voice to those long silenced. To validate experience. To say this happened to me—and be heard.

There was power in it. To speak. To be believed. To discover that your personal story held weight.

We learned more. And at some point… we knew better.

But somewhere along the way, that clarity began to blur. The awareness we had long wished for became a double-edged sword.

What began as a path to healing turned into a vortex of constant labeling, diagnosing, dissecting.

It’s no longer about discovery—it’s about decoding. Every moment, every mood, every conversation suddenly carries clinical weight.

You’re not just tired—you’re burnt out.

You’re not just shy—you’re avoidantly attached.

You’re not just annoyed—you’re triggered.

Somewhere along the line, awareness stopped being a tool and became a performance.

We are drowning in hyper-awareness.

We’ve absorbed every possible trauma—sometimes even those we haven’t lived. Because a stranger with a ring light told us we might. And their algorithm guessed right.

Now, the line between what’s mine and what I’ve been told is mine has blurred. We carry feelings we don’t recognize. Diagnoses we haven’t examined. Patterns we don’t remember forming.

What once felt like a path to empathy and connection has become a heavy burden—especially for those who already feel everything too deeply.

We’ve crossed a threshold. Where constant self-examination doesn’t bring peace—just fatigue. Just noise.



And now, even stillness feels crowded.

It’s made us afraid of joy.

Because every light moment might be masking something darker.

Every branch might get ripped from our mouth.



I miss the days when I was just tired. When all I needed was a good sleep, a good dance, a good laugh—and then I’d go back to work, and function just fine.

I miss when things happened because I messed up—not because of my parents, not the generational weight, not society, not the universe quietly conspiring against me.

Hyper-awareness made me  irresponsible, in a way. It gave me too many explanations, and not enough action.

As awareness grew, it reached beyond the self—into systems, into history, into the lives we’re born into.

And as if being human wasn’t complicated enough, we became aware of identity—what it means, what it costs, how it can shape the entire trajectory of your life before you’ve even taken your first breath.

We became aware of identity-based violence, of inequality written into systems, of the way some identities are preferred while others are punished. We became aware that even in places that preach freedom, fighting those injustices can get you silenced. We became aware that some lives are amplified, while others must beg just to be heard.

So what do I do with that? Should I have prayed, before birth, to be born into the ""chosen"" ones? Or was I always meant to carry the curse of seeing too much, feeling too much, knowing too well?

And then there’s money—quiet, relentless, towering above us. Eventually, we became aware that we are minuscule compared to it. 

We can speak out, support the silenced ones, read, educate, rise above. We can try to unearth the roots of rotten ideologies—but those roots are buried deep. And we will die long before that tree ever does.

So yes, we are small. Small in size. Small in time. And awareness makes sure we know it.



To be this aware is to live with open eyes—and an even more open heart.

Awareness has made me more analytical and understanding.

I forgave my parents for everything I once thought they failed to give me—and loved them more deeply for everything they did.

I understood my student who asked a question we’d already answered many times before—maybe he was distracted, maybe life was loud that day. Still, he showed up. He didn’t let go. And for that alone, he earned my respect.

I even understood my friend who cancels plans last minute—again and again. Because sometimes, being reliable is a privilege of the mentally steady. And showing up for yourself might be all they had the strength for that day.

But GOD, does it suck—to carry this much awareness while others drift through life untouched, unbothered, untouched by nuance.

At this point, it feels like willful blindness. Because it’s there. Blatant. Screaming in plain sight.

Sometimes, I envy those who don’t notice everything.  Who get to move through the world without reading between every line, without carrying the weight of what goes unsaid.

But hey, Even in the noise, I choose to see.

We became aware of everything. It came like a wave—not gentle, not slow, but crashing: fast, wide, all at once.

We had no time to prepare. Only time to absorb.

But awareness alone is not a revolution. The point, as Frantz Fanon said, is to change this world—the one we now see so clearly.

I hope our generation finds its mission—and fulfills it.

I hope I don’t betray it.

So that maybe, just maybe, we can feel whole again.

But wholeness won’t come from waiting—it comes from becoming.

**Signature:**

After all, I am Hibiscus Sauvage. Wild, but not lost. Soft, but never small.

Until I find the words again.

And remember, take what you need, leave the rest.

Meanwhile, Bodhisattva Maitreya’s actual path—forged over *countless lifetimes* of relentless cultivation—would shatter our modern sensibilities. The chasm between his sacrifice and our spiritual tourism isn’t just wide; it’s existential.  

### **1. We Mistake Convenience for Commitment**  
Maitreya’s generosity wasn’t donating spare change or sharing viral posts. It was:  
- Giving away his life to feed a starving lion cab
- Starving himself to feed others (literally)  
- Reborn in hell realms to alleviate suffering there  

Modern seekers? We debate whether 10 minutes of daily meditation is ""too much"" if it conflicts with brunch plans. The idea of lifetimes spent perfecting a single virtue—like patience while being dismembered, or generosity while penniless—isn’t just foreign; it *offends* our efficiency-obsessed mindset.  

### **2. We’ve Never Faced Real Spiritual Austerity**  
Maitreya’s path demanded:  
- **Physical endurance:** Years in freezing caves, begging for alms, sleeping on graves  
- **Mental resilience:** Meditating while insects burrowed into his flesh (as Milarepa endured)  
- **Emotional surrender:** Watching loved ones die repeatedly over rebirths, yet persisting in compassion  

Today’s ""challenges""? Missing a yoga class because of traffic, or ""struggling"" with a digital detox. We’ve sanitized spirituality into self-care—while Maitreya’s path was never about comfort, but *shattering the ego* through unimaginable trials.  

### **3. We Don’t Even Understand the Timeline**  
Maitreya didn’t ""manifest enlightenment"" in a 7-day retreat. His cultivation spans:  
- **Kalpas (cosmic epochs)** of deliberate rebirth into suffering  
- **Eons** perfecting each paramita (generosity, ethics, patience, etc.)  
- **Lifetimes** as animals, hungry ghosts, and hell beings to purify karma  

Modern seekers? We quit practices if results aren’t instant. The idea of *millennia* of effort for others’ benefit is incomprehensible in an age of 30-second reels and two-day shipping.  

### **4. Our Compassion Has Conditions**  
Maitreya’s vow: *""I will endure endless suffering if it liberates even one being.""*  
Our version: *""I’ll volunteer… if it fits my schedule and doesn’t drain me.""*  

We preach ""self-love"" while Maitreya *burned his body as a lamp* to guide others (as told in the *Lotus Sutra*). We call minor inconveniences ""boundary-setting""—he saw *no boundary* between his liberation and others’.  

### **The Harsh Realization**  
Maitreya’s path isn’t about ""balance"" or ""mindfulness."" It’s about:  
🔥 **Total surrender** to awakening, regardless of personal cost  
🔥 **Relentless perseverance** beyond what we deem ""reasonable""  
🔥 **A love so vast** it willingly embraces lifetimes of agony  

Modern spirituality often avoids this truth because it’s *terrifying*. We want enlightenment to be comfortable, Instagrammable, and achieved between coffee breaks. Maitreya’s reality? It would break us.

I tried everything keto, intermittent fasting, even pre-workout drinks that left me jittery. Then my sister mentioned Mitolyn, a “mitochondria-boosting” supplement. Skeptical but hopeful, I gave it six weeks. Here’s what happened.

# First Impressions

Mitolyn arrived in a plain box no flashy marketing. The bottle promised “natural energy” and “metabolic support” with ingredients like rhodiola and maqui berry. I liked that it was stimulant-free. Started with one capsule each morning after breakfast.

Week 1-2: Slow but Steady  
No magic overnight. By day 5, I noticed fewer afternoon crashes. Still needed coffee, but only one cup instead of three. My sweet tooth faded a bit—fewer snack raids on the pantry. Scale didn’t budge, but my jeans felt less tight.

Week 3-4: Energy Kicked In  
Waking up became easier. I skipped naps and kept up with my kids’ chaos. Started walking 30 minutes daily (a win for me!). Lost 3 pounds. Best part? No jitters or weird heart races like with other supplements.

Week 5-6: Real Changes  
By week 5, my focus at work improved. Finished tasks without zoning out. Dropped another 4 pounds—total of 7 lbs in six weeks. Even my husband noticed I wasn’t grumpy by 8 p.m.

# What Is Mitolyn? 

I’ve used Mitolyn for six weeks and love it. Two capsules each morning gave me steady energy no afternoon crash and helped me lose about eight pounds without changing my diet. I felt calmer, more focused, and less stressed.

It works by boosting mitochondrial function with natural ingredients: Maqui Berry for fat breakdown, Rhodiola for stamina, and Griffonia for mood and cravings.

Pros: real weight loss, more energy, better focus, all‑natural.

Cons: takes a few weeks, daily use, online only.

# How Does Mitolyn Work Inside The Body? 

 I’ve used Mitolyn for six weeks and saw real change. It fixes the root of stubborn fat mitochondrial slowdown. My energy stayed high and my mood stayed even.

Each morning, I took two capsules with breakfast. By week two, I felt less tired. By week four, my clothes fit looser. By week six, I’d lost seven pounds without changing meals.

Mitolyn’s blend felt gentle but strong. Maqui Berry and Haematococcus cut cell stress. Berberine and Rhodiola kept my blood sugar steady and turned on fat burn. Schisandra and Griffonia eased stress so I didn’t snack out of worry. Amla and cacao helped me feel full of clean energy all day.

Pros: steady fat loss, no jitters, calm focus, natural mix.

Cons: you need to take it daily and wait a few weeks.

For best results, take two capsules with food, drink water, and move a bit each day. It’s not a quick fix. It’s a cell‑level boost that lasts.  

# Mitolyn Ingredients 

 I’ve taken Mitolyn daily and watched it work. Here’s what’s inside

* Maqui Berry: A strong antioxidant. I felt less tired and saw steadier energy.
* Rhodiola Rosea: An adaptogen for stress. It helped me stay calm and focused.
* Haematococcus (Astaxanthin): Protects cell powerhouses. I had no midday crashes.
* Amla (Indian Gooseberry): Boosts digestion and nutrient use. I felt lighter and less bloated.
* Schisandra: Lowers stress hormones. I noticed less belly tension.
* Cacao Extract: Uplifts mood and energy. Gave me a gentle lift without jitters.
* Berberine: Balances blood sugar. Helped me burn fat, not store it.
* Griffonia (5‑HTP): Curbs cravings and steadies mood. Nights became easier.

Each part works on your mitochondria your cells’ energy centers. Together, they helped me lose weight slowly, gain clean energy, and stay calm. No rush, no crash. Always check with your doctor before starting any supplement.

# Benefits Of Mitolyn 

 After using Mitolin. Here is what I achieved:

I had steady energy all day: No more afternoon crash. I felt awake without extra coffee.

My stress stayed low: Even on busy days, I stayed calm. That cut my stress snacking.

My focus improved: Work tasks felt easier. I didn’t jump between things.

I lost weight slowly and surely: About seven pounds in six weeks. No strict diet—just Mitolyn plus my normal meals.

My mood felt balanced: I didn’t get sudden “hangry” or anxious.

My workouts felt better: I had more stamina for walks and light exercise.

My digestion felt smoother: Less bloating and discomfort.

Overall, I felt healthier at a cell level: Mitolyn targets mitochondria, so you burn fat naturally.

Pros I experienced: more energy, less stress, better focus, steady weight loss, improved digestion.

Cons: you must take it daily and wait a few weeks.

# Mitolyn Side Effects 

 I’ve been on Mitolyn for  six week and felt great. I never got jitters or felt wired. My energy rose and my cravings dropped. I didn’t use any caffeine boost.

My digestion stayed smooth. A few days in, I had mild tummy rumble. It passed fast. After that, no issues. My weight kept moving down. I felt lighter and more active.

I like that it has no harsh chemicals or fake stimulants. It’s all natural. Still, I checked with my doctor first. If you have health concerns or take meds, do the same.

Overall, Mitolyn felt safe and effective. It helped my energy, my mood, and my metabolism all without a harsh side effect.

# Is Mitolyn a Scam or Legit? 

I’ve tried Mitolyn for eight weeks. It felt safe and real. It’s made in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified lab. I saw steady energy boosts and fat loss. No jitters, no crash.

The ingredients are clinically tested. Real users report better metabolism and mood. If you don’t like it, there’s a 90-day money-back guarantee. I ordered from the official site and got the real deal.

No scams here. Just a natural formula that works—backed by science and a solid refund policy.  

#  How I Take Mitolyn?

 I have been using  Mitolyn for a long time. Here’s how I used it:

I swallowed two capsules with my breakfast. That timing gave me steady energy all day. I never felt a crash or needed extra caffeine.

On days I forgot, I noticed a slight dip in my focus. So I made it part of my routine—right after I pour my coffee.

I drank plenty of water. That helped the capsules move through my system and kept me hydrated.

I kept eating my normal meals. No extreme diets. Still, I moved more short walks, light stretching, nothing hard. That small activity boosted my results.

If you’re new to Mitolyn: start with one capsule for the first two days. See how you feel. Then move up to two capsules daily. Always take with food.

Don’t double up if you miss a dose. Just take your regular two capsules the next morning.

Check with your doctor before you start especially if you have health issues or take meds. Follow these simple steps, and you’ll see steady energy, better focus, and gradual weight loss.

# Where to Buy Mitolyn? 

 I ordered Mitolyn from the official site and got it in five days. It felt reassuring to know it was real. I tried searching on Amazon and eBay but found only fakes.

Buying direct means you get the genuine formula. No weird additives, no copycats. The site often runs discounts and a money-back promise.

If you see Mitolyn anywhere else, skip it. Only the official website ships the true product. That’s where I found the real deal and you should too.

# Conclusion 

 I’ve used Mitolyn for six weeks and rate it 4.7 out of 5. It felt real and high‑quality. I lost weight steadily, gained clean energy, and stayed focused.

Mitolyn works on mitochondria, so it’s more than a quick fix. It curbs cravings, boosts metabolism, and lifts mood. My mind felt clear and my body felt strong.

The 90‑day money‑back guarantee gave me confidence to try it. If you want a natural, science‑backed way to burn fat and boost energy, Mitolyn is worth it. ",1,1746782830.0,Healthy_Supplement020,0,1.0,False

My father had been a smoker for over 20 years, and I wanted to help him quit in subtle ways. I didn’t want to directly tell him he had to quit, because I knew that would make him pull back, so I found ways to guide him toward that goal.

My father was the typical smoker – he believed it was ""cool"" to smoke cigarettes. He was influenced by that constant ritual, where cigarettes were seen as a way to relax or even ""make peace with the world."" I remember, he often smoked a cigarette while drinking coffee, believing that it was one of those little moments of relaxation in his life.

I know that many smokers think the same way, and I understand that. Through conversations, I told him how ridiculous it was and how it wouldn’t bring him anything good. I mean, it wasn’t easy – it was a battle, both with him and with his addiction. Smoking had become part of his daily routine, and his free will had given in to the weight of that vice.

However, the struggle was long, and I realized that just physically removing cigarettes wouldn’t be enough. That’s where changes in his diet came in. I started introducing healthy snacks, like fruits and vegetables, that he could eat instead of cigarettes. Instead of reaching for a cigarette, he would often grab a slice of apple or a handful of almonds. I also introduced teas that helped him relax and kept his mind off the cigarettes.

I don’t want to share all the details, as I don’t want to be ridiculed, but this was a significant moment in my father’s life. Besides helping him emotionally break free from his addiction, I managed to get him to a point where he was determined to quit. Now, my father has quit smoking, and he is forever grateful for that help. His outlook on life has changed, and I am proud that he was able to break free from the chains of addiction. My approach may not have been perfect, but it definitely worked.",2,1746782679.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

Think making cookie cutters sounds easy? Think again. This is old-school tinsmithing — no glue guns or cheating. You'll be cutting, bending and soldering your own custom cutter with real tools, taught by an expert who's actually done this before (not just watched a YouTube video).

Perfect if you fancy making something with your hands for once, or just want to brag you’ve tried a craft that’s nearly extinct. Spots are limited, so don’t dither.

1kie8cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1kie8cf/husband_38m_wants_to_meet_ex_from_10_years_ago/,"Husband (38m) wants to meet ex from 10 years ago for coffee. They only text for birthdays. I don’t trust her, but do trust him, so why do I (34f) feel bad?","I’ve (34f) been with my husband (37m) since 2017. His ex-girlfriend and him broke up at the end of 2015, mostly amicably.

I think they tried to keep a friendship at the start, but it didn’t really work well because they weren’t fully over each other, and so he wanted to not risk closing himself off any longer from new people. The friendship cooled off. In 2017, she then wanted to visit him for Christmas (13 hour flight for her), shortly after him and I met. She insisted it was “just because” and without ulterior motives. He denied because he wasn’t feeling fully comfortable, and shared he’d met me a month before, and she got upset that he hadn’t told her that he’d met someone. (“Over him”, obviously. 🙄)

In the past years, they’ve maybe texted twice a year for each other’s birthday. She knows that he’s in a relationship with me, maybe even knows he’s married to me from his socials, but they don’t talk in-depth. I learned that he’d like to keep or re-establish a friendship, so I reached out to her about two years into us dating, asked first if she was comfortable at all talking to me and if not, no big deal. She encouraged me. I told her I just wanted to say Hi so that things wouldn’t be weird when we meet one day. She started sharing screenshots of our conversation with my husband without telling me, and then told him twice that I seemed insecure (??) and really like I was looking for reassurance (???). I didn’t appreciate the lack of transparency with me (you know, something like “hey on second thought i think i’d feel better if we have a group chat/i’d like to share what we talk about with him”). This was six years ago. He also didn’t understand what she was going on about re: insecurity and just ignored that.

She has reached out to him last year and this year because she’ll be visiting the country him and I live in, for an event. Asked to meet for coffee. Last year didn’t work out timewise, this year might. I told him I don’t trust her, but that he can make his own decisions.

He’s suggested to her that they meet for coffee and a dog walk with our dogs, now waiting to see what she says. Originally, we had the idea that I’d come, but I really don’t feel like wasting my time on someone who has tried to badmouth me to my partner. I just feel weird about it all, because my one exchange with her was negative, and to be honest I don’t understand why she’s so adamant about trying to meet up with him suddenly 10 years later. If it was me in her position, and he had declined me last year, I would’ve taken that as “ball’s in your court” and otherwise moved on…?

Tl;dr: Husband wants to meet his ex girlfriend from 10 years ago, they haven't had a real friendship in the past 8 years, I feel weird about it and would love to hear some perspectives.",3,1746782576.0,AskWomenOver30,11,0.71,False

1kie7b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kie7b9/i_locked_my_brother_outside_at_nighti_think/,I Locked My Brother Outside at Night...I Think?,"Alright, so I (26M) live way out in the middle of nowhere, in this old farmhouse that’s been in my family forever. My younger brother Theo (21M) just moved in with me last week after breaking up with his girlfriend, Becca. They were together for years, but she dumped him because she “needed space.” Honestly, I don’t blame her — Theo’s kind of immature, always staying out late, forgetting his keys, just generally not having his life together. She’s in med school, totally burned out, so yeah, I can’t imagine his crap helped with her stress.

Anyway, when Theo moved in, I told him straight up: 

“If you’re out past midnight, I’m locking up. I go to bed early, figure it out.”

Friday night rolls around, and Theo goes drinking with some old friends. Around 12:30 a.m., I hear banging on the front door. Not knocking — like, hard banging. I check my phone: no texts, no missed calls. I figure, great, he forgot his damn keys again.

I get up, kind of annoyed, and check the peephole. It’s dark, but I can see someone standing there. I flip on the porch light — yep, it’s Theo. But something feels… off.

He’s just standing there, not saying a word, smiling this weird-ass smile. His clothes look soaked, muddy, even though it hadn’t rained. His hair’s all stuck to his face, and his eyes look… too wide, like the whites are bulging out.

I crack the door and go, “You okay, man?”

No answer. Just smiling.

Then my phone buzzes. It’s a text from Theo:  
*Hey bro, sorry, staying at Charlie’s tonight. Don’t wait up.*

I just froze.

I look back at the door — Theo is outside, still smiling, softly swaying now, like he’s waiting to be let in.

At this point, I’m pissed, thinking maybe he sent the text earlier and just came home after all. he's clearly too drunk to comprehed anything and I’m too tired to deal with his crap, so I quietly lock the deadbolt, turn off the porch light, and go back upstairs. He can sleep in his truck tonight. 

Next morning, I get up, make coffee, look outside — no sign of Theo’s truck.

Around 9 a.m., Theo comes strolling in, looking completely normal. Clean clothes, dry hair, sunglasses on, yawning. I pour him coffee and go, “Rough night?” He’s like, “Yeah, puked all over Charlie’s bathroom. He was pissed.”

I decide to take this time to fuss at him about the drinking and driving situation, ""you could have texted me when you got there after you left here. so I knew you made it at least.""

he looked confused, ""I rode home with Charlie.""

I ask, “You didn’t come home at all last night?”

He looks at me, confused. “No? I texted you, remember?”

I tell him, “Someone was banging on the door. I *saw* you — muddy, wet, smiling, just standing there.”

He swears up and down it wasn’t him. He looked legit confused and a little freaked when I described it. I think he is still screwing with me so I told him, if it happens again, I’m not letting him in.

So, that night, Theo goes out again, this time to the bar with our friend Alex. I stay up watching some TV, but by midnight I’m done. Lock up, turn off the lights, head upstairs.

Around 1 a.m., I wake up.

The pounding’s back.

I sit up in bed, Check my phone — no texts, no calls. again.

I peek through the curtain — Theo’s truck is in the driveway.

I go downstairs, staying quiet, just listening.

The pounding stops.

Then I hear it — “Let me in.”

It’s Theo’s voice.

But it’s… wrong. Too low, like he’s crouched or something. And too soft, like he’s whispering.

I glance through the peephole.

There’s someone crouched on the porch.

It *looks* like Theo — but twisted, hunched down, knees bent weird, hands flat on the porch. His head tilts up toward the door, and his neck stretches way too far. His smile’s too wide. At first, I think maybe he just drank WAY too much and is on the verge of blacking out. I’m about to open the door and then — I hear a creak on the stairs behind me.

I spin around.

It’s Theo.

Standing at the bottom of the stairs, just in his boxers, hair messy, rubbing his eyes, like he just woke up. He mumbles, “Dude, what the hell is that noise?”

I'm confused.

I glance back at the door and look through the peephole again.

The porch is empty.

No one’s there. No crouched figure. No pounding. 

Theo came over, yawning. “Was someone knocking? I thought I heard something.”

I just shake my head, “Yeah… someone was.” 

So, at this point either Theo is messing with me somehow or I’m going crazy. I don’t know how he could have got inside, stripped off his clothes and behind me so fast. 

So… Reddit, AITA for locking my brother out? Or is there something seriously messed up going on here, maybe I am going crazy? Maybe Theo's on something that's making him act weird?

Any help would be appreciated. ",6,1746782450.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

I'm looking for some help and guidance on how everyone else can save for a house, live day to day, pay for constant weddings, hens, holidays, doctors and dentists etc etc. I was never given a great example of how to do all of this and I'm embarrassed I'm at 30yo and I have nothing.
I have 8yrs experience in my job, I earn way under market value, I have reached out to HR, managers and even the union (which I'm not part of but they helped out a bit) I argued people joining with no experience in the last year and they are on €10k more than me etc etc, I was told to leave and come back and that was the only way to do it.

Currently on €32k pa. After I pay tax, I'm left  with €2290 pm.
I'm living at home but have to pay €600pm.
Then at €1690
- €90pm loan
- €100pm credit card
- €30 pm health insurance (benefit in kind)
- € 40 misc (Spotify/netflix)
- € 50 sports club
- € 200 pm public transport (for work and sports club)
Total €1180

I'm due a bonus of €1000 next month which I plan to save 

This total is before saving, paying for a coffee, the odd lunch. I don't go out for dinners or drinks very often, maybe once every 5/6 weeks. I do vape from time to time but outside of that I don't know where my money is going and leave little to save. And I'm at the age now where weddings are happening and hens. I'm grateful to be invited to these things but it's financially crippling me. I have hen Feb and march next year and weddings April and may next year.
I have regular hospital appointments for a condition I have, those are free at the moment but I'm getting nowhere and will probably have to go private. Dentist is €180 per appointment every 3 months. And will probably need surgery that will cost €2/3k which is not covered by insurance.
I got funding for a professional course that will give me qualifications in my field but that will take 2 hrs to complete.
I'm a bit lost as what to do or how to approach this.

I did have a second job for the last 5 months paying me €80 PW but it was taken over by a new guy and it was being run poorly, possibly money laundering, illegal activity and I had encounters with customers that police had to be involved so I just quit this week.

I'm just wondering if anyone has any ideas or tips about what to do

I feel like I’ve probably dealt with this for years given my symptoms have been ups and downs with energy, border line depression and irritability. Little background - I’ve been into nutrition and fitness for around 10 years. 2017-2019 was basically a “bro” diet = high protein, moderate carbs, lower fat….felt ok and never tested sugars but given now all I know about nutrition I definitely had symptoms. 2019-2020 was a vegan diet = high carbs (350g+ plus per day), fat 80-90g but mainly poly/monounsaturated and 150g plant protein….stopped the diet due to low ferritin levels but actually had some great bouts of energy - I.E running 10km almost every other day and feeling good….small bouts of hypoglycaemic episodes with chronic headaches which I do not suffer with ever. 2020-2025 = basically higher protein (animal based), higher fat (often keto at times) and carbs when as needed but definitely lower at points….This is where my hypoglycaemic episodes have really become evident. Lows quite often unless I keep my carbs pretty strict and low (then I stay around the 4.8mmol mark) but I have reoccurring lows…for example this morning I woke up at 3.8mmol had 3 eggs, 1 avocado, Greek yogurt, collagen, blueberries and macadamia and a black coffee after…blood sugar is as the picture attached 3.0mmol….now I know the caffeine isn’t helping and I only stick to one a day but do you believe that coffee could be causing all my problems? It almost seems like insulin resistance (which worries me) have i done some damaged by going to high fat at times? Classic raised blood lipids (high HDL low triglycerides) on a low carb diet and weirdly my HBA1C was 5.3mmol on a low carb diet Vs 4.8mmol on a vegan diet of 350g carbs. Another example is last night we had some lean beef, mash potato with butter, veg and a slice of cheesecake for dinner….it took my blood sugar to 6.0mmol (hardly a bump after a carb heavy meal)…whereas my wife’s for comparison was 8.7mmol after an hour (which is probably a normal response)……i apologise this is a lot of information but I truly feel lost and for somebody who feels like they know a lot about nutrition and try’s to stay educated I don’t know what to do….my blood sugars are starting to cause issue to my day to day.

not in voice,
but in the way I carried what no one clapped for.

I made peace in the silence
while she made noise in the chaos.
She cried in public,
I bled in private.
And when the house shook with her footsteps,
my heart flinched like a dog who knew
that love, too, could come stomping.

She said, “My mood depends on yours.”
What she meant was:
“Swallow your grief so I don’t have to taste mine.”
And I did.
Until I couldn’t.

I gave space.
She filled it with hurt.
I gave patience.
She called it control.
And when I asked for breath,
she told the world I had suffocated her.

She carried no fault—
only stories.
Bent facts into pity,
twisted memory into defense,
and wore victimhood like a wedding veil.

I taught her how to steer the roads
paid for her schooling, pushed for her networking
held up her future with hands blistered from holding us together.
She took the keys,
the credit,
and the narrative.
All I took was the blame.

But I was not faultless.
There were days the weight turned sharp in my mouth,
and I spoke from the wound, not the wisdom.
Anger spilled where gentleness should’ve stood.
Yet I did not run from the mirror—
I met it.
Owned it.
Worked the jagged edges down with quiet effort,
not just apologies,
but change.

Yes, my voice was loud—
they all heard the thunder when I broke.
But no one noticed the storm that built it:
the slow, relentless drip of blame,
the sideways glances laced with doubt,
the truths twisted just enough to sting.
Tiny betrayals,
soft as whispers,
repeated until they hollowed out my restraint.
And when I finally shattered,
they pointed at the sound—
never the silence that broke me.

She gave nothing freely,
but swore she gave everything.
I gave everything freely,
but she swore it was nothing.

And now they say I walked away.
But I didn’t walk.
I crawled out from under a weight I never agreed to carry.

There were moments—
a dance by a bonfire, soaked in woodsmoke and relief,
where guilt melted into laughter,
and we disappeared into each other beneath the hush of wet pine and soft night.
There were coffee shops on Saturdays,
board games in canvas tents,
her cooking steamed like memory,
our shopping synced like instinct.
For a while, it worked.
For a while, it felt like a life.
And that, too, is part of the story.

She’ll tell it simply—
a sad story in one sentence.
I was angry. She endured.
And the world, trained to trust the tearful,
won’t ask what came before the storm.

She and her family
will spin silence into guilt
like Rumplestiltskin with straw—
turning absence into accusation,
until the lie gleams like truth.

She’ll thrive in a world that only sees headlines.
I’ll rebuild in one that knows what it means
to live without applause.

No gods came to stop this.
No dharma intervened.
But maybe that’s the lesson—
not every fire is meant to be put out.
Some are meant to burn down the lie.

So here I stand.
Not bitter.
But awake.
Not victorious.
But finally free.

**TL;DR:** This perfume is a game changer—it's luxurious, long-lasting, and elegant enough to make you feel like a million bucks, whether you’re owning the boardroom or turning heads on a night out. If you’re after a scent that screams confidence, this is it!

---

Let me set the scene: You walk into a room, and heads turn—not because you're strutting in like you own the place (although maybe you are), but because you smell absolutely divine. Does that sound familiar? If not, let’s talk about Kilian’s ""Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec Moi."" This fragrance is like the imaginary friend you wish was real—romantic, sultry, and utterly captivating! 

### The Deets: What’s in the Bottle?

- **Fragrance Profile:**
  - **Top Notes:** Blackcurrant and peach—think juicy and indulgent, like biting into a perfectly ripe summer fruit.
  - **Heart Notes:** Jasmine and rose—hello, floral elegance! This combo delivers a rich bouquet that’s sophisticated yet flirtatious.
  - **Base Notes:** Patchouli, amber, and vanilla—now we're talking! This mix wraps you up in warmth, making you feel like your favorite sweater during chilly evenings.

#### Standout Factors

- **Lasting Power:** This baby is not just a flash in the pan. You’ll find it clings to your skin for a solid 8-10 hours. That's right—it's perfect for powering through your workday and transitioning smoothly into your evening plans. 
- **Sillage:** Whether you want to be subtle or leave a lasting impression, this scent is beautifully balanced. It won’t knock people out with its strength, but it definitely gets noticed. 
- **Versatility:** Whether hitting that romantic dinner or navigating through office politics, ""Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec Moi"" can handle it all effortlessly. 
- **Packaging:** I mean, can we just take a moment? The black and gold accents on the bottle scream luxury. It’s sleek, modern, and would look fabulous on any vanity (or coffee table for those of us who consider our fragrance collection *art*).

### The Good, the Bad, and the Scent-sational

**Pros:**

- **Long-lasting and Strong Performance:** No one likes spraying their perfume 20 times a day. With this, you can spritz it once in the morning and forget about it (until compliments roll in, of course).
- **Unique and Alluring Fragrance Profile:** If you want to smell like a knockout without walking out of the house feeling like every other person you pass, this is your ticket. 
- **Perfect for Confident Women:** This fragrance has a ""you own the place"" vibe. 

**Cons:**

- **Higher Price Point:** It’s definitely an investment. But hey, luxury is meant to be savored, right?
- **Might Not Float Everyone’s Boat:** If you're more into citrusy or light fresh scents, this might not be in your wheelhouse. 

### Bottom Line

Seriously, if you're tired of being one of the flock and want to pull off that effortlessly chic look, take it from me: ""Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec Moi"" is worth checking out! I can just imagine strutting into the next big meeting, feeling like the boss I was born to be.

1kie59h,https://www.reddit.com/r/spoopycjades/comments/1kie59h/aitah_for_locking_my_brother_out_at_night/,AITAH For Locking My Brother Out at Night???,"Alright, so I (26M) live way out in the middle of nowhere, in this old farmhouse that’s been in my family forever. My younger brother Theo (21M) just moved in with me last week after breaking up with his girlfriend, Becca. They were together for years, but she dumped him because she “needed space.” Honestly, I don’t blame her — Theo’s kind of immature, always staying out late, forgetting his keys, just generally not having his life together. She’s in med school, totally burned out, so yeah, I can’t imagine his crap helped with her stress.

Anyway, when Theo moved in, I told him straight up: 

“If you’re out past midnight, I’m locking up. I go to bed early, figure it out.”

Friday night rolls around, and Theo goes drinking with some old friends. Around 12:30 a.m., I hear banging on the front door. Not knocking — like, hard banging. I check my phone: no texts, no missed calls. I figure, great, he forgot his damn keys again.

I get up, kind of annoyed, and check the peephole. It’s dark, but I can see someone standing there. I flip on the porch light — yep, it’s Theo. But something feels… off.

He’s just standing there, not saying a word, smiling this weird-ass smile. His clothes look soaked, muddy, even though it hadn’t rained. His hair’s all stuck to his face, and his eyes look… too wide, like the whites are bulging out.

I crack the door and go, “You okay, man?”

No answer. Just smiling.

Then my phone buzzes. It’s a text from Theo:  
*Hey bro, sorry, staying at Charlie’s tonight. Don’t wait up.*

I just froze.

I look back at the door — Theo is outside, still smiling, softly swaying now, like he’s waiting to be let in.

At this point, I’m pissed, thinking maybe he sent the text earlier and just came home after all. he's clearly too drunk to comprehed anything and I’m too tired to deal with his crap, so I quietly lock the deadbolt, turn off the porch light, and go back upstairs. He can sleep in his truck tonight. 

Next morning, I get up, make coffee, look outside — no sign of Theo’s truck.

Around 9 a.m., Theo comes strolling in, looking completely normal. Clean clothes, dry hair, sunglasses on, yawning. I pour him coffee and go, “Rough night?” He’s like, “Yeah, puked all over Charlie’s bathroom. He was pissed.”

I decide to take this time to fuss at him about the drinking and driving situation, ""you could have texted me when you got there after you left here. so I knew you made it at least.""

he looked confused, ""I rode home with Charlie.""

I ask, “You didn’t come home at all last night?”

He looks at me, confused. “No? I texted you, remember?”

I tell him, “Someone was banging on the door. I *saw* you — muddy, wet, smiling, just standing there.”

He swears up and down it wasn’t him. He looked legit confused and a little freaked when I described it. I think he is still screwing with me so I told him, if it happens again, I’m not letting him in.

So, that night, Theo goes out again, this time to the bar with our friend Alex. I stay up watching some TV, but by midnight I’m done. Lock up, turn off the lights, head upstairs.

Around 1 a.m., I wake up.

The pounding’s back.

I sit up in bed, Check my phone — no texts, no calls. again.

I peek through the curtain — Theo’s truck is in the driveway.

I go downstairs, staying quiet, just listening.

The pounding stops.

Then I hear it — “Let me in.”

It’s Theo’s voice.

But it’s… wrong. Too low, like he’s crouched or something. And too soft, like he’s whispering.

I glance through the peephole.

There’s someone crouched on the porch.

It *looks* like Theo — but twisted, hunched down, knees bent weird, hands flat on the porch. His head tilts up toward the door, and his neck stretches way too far. His smile’s too wide. At first, I think maybe he just drank WAY too much and is on the verge of blacking out. I’m about to open the door and then — I hear a creak on the stairs behind me.

I spin around.

It’s Theo.

Standing at the bottom of the stairs, just in his boxers, hair messy, rubbing his eyes, like he just woke up. He mumbles, “Dude, what the hell is that noise?”

I'm confused.

I glance back at the door and look through the peephole again.

The porch is empty.

No one’s there. No crouched figure. No pounding. 

Theo came over, yawning. “Was someone knocking? I thought I heard something.”

I just shake my head, “Yeah… someone was.” 

So, at this point either Theo is messing with me somehow or I’m going crazy. I don’t know how he could have got inside, stripped off his clothes and behind me so fast. 

So…, AITA for locking my brother out? Or is there something seriously messed up going on here, maybe I am going crazy? Maybe Theo's on something that's making him act weird?

Any help would be appreciated. ",2,1746782193.0,spoopycjades,0,1.0,False

But lately i have been getting a more bitter or/and watery coffee taste I don’t taste the hints nor feel like am giving the bean bag a proper go. I usually go with 1:16.6 ratio and use dried, naturally processed, washed beans with 90-93C water temperature and as for the grind size i tens to grind medium to medium coarse using the Timemore sculpture 078s (14.5-16). I usually follow this 50-50-50-50-50 technique and dk how to explore other techniques and why should i do so. As for this video it is to show that maybe am doing something like really wrong pouring over the water. For reference in this video i used dried processed coffee With 1:16.6 ratio (15g of coffee) and a medium to coarse grind size with 93C water temperature. The taste was a bit bitter and water base when it should of been rich and fruity. I also need to mention that i use beans from good local roasters and it is supposed to have a very high quality but i think am juat wasting beans at this point 😔",0,1746782025.0,pourover,6,0.5,False

1kie2cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1kie2cf/about_the_rousing_coffee/,About the Rousing Coffee,"I looked at the Rousing Coffee and a question popped up, ""Wait that's not how the coffee fruit looks like.""

So the coffee's process from the fruit to bean starts from an unripen green fruit, and then ripens into a bright red fruit. This is the coffee cherry, the thing that you'd actually find growing in a farm somewhere, but not in your local blonde girl's Frappuccino.

That fruit is then harvested and processed, removing the outer pulp leaving the greenish yellow seed in the middle. The seeds have to be first dried, and then roasted, before it becomes the deep brown coffee bean that you can then use to fuel your sad existence. 

This means for the Rousing Coffee to be collected, your mons have to:

\- Collect the ripen fruit

\- Process away the pulp

\- Dry the seeds

\- Roast the beans

Before they can give you each bit of brown goodness that you use to dress a salad for some reason.

I feel like I’ve probably dealt with this for years given my symptoms have been ups and downs with energy, border line depression and irritability. Little background - I’ve been into nutrition and fitness for around 10 years. 2017-2019 was basically a “bro” diet = high protein, moderate carbs, lower fat….felt ok and never tested sugars but given now all I know about nutrition I definitely had symptoms. 2019-2020 was a vegan diet = high carbs (350g+ plus per day), fat 80-90g but mainly poly/monounsaturated and 150g plant protein….stopped the diet due to low ferritin levels but actually had some great bouts of energy - I.E running 10km almost every other day and feeling good….small bouts of hypoglycaemic episodes with chronic headaches which I do not suffer with ever. 2020-2025 = basically higher protein (animal based), higher fat (often keto at times) and carbs when as needed but definitely lower at points….This is where my hypoglycaemic episodes have really become evident. Lows quite often unless I keep my carbs pretty strict and low (then I stay around the 4.8mmol mark) but I have reoccurring lows…for example this morning I woke up at 3.8mmol had 3 eggs, 1 avocado, Greek yogurt, collagen, blueberries and macadamia and a black coffee after…blood sugar is as the picture attached 3.0mmol….now I know the caffeine isn’t helping and I only stick to one a day but do you believe that coffee could be causing all my problems? It almost seems like insulin resistance (which worries me) have i done some damaged by going to high fat at times? Classic raised blood lipids (high HDL low triglycerides) on a low carb diet and weirdly my HBA1C was 5.3mmol on a low carb diet Vs 4.8mmol on a vegan diet of 350g carbs. Another example is last night we had some lean beef, mash potato with butter, veg and a slice of cheesecake for dinner….it took my blood sugar to 6.0mmol (hardly a bump after a carb heavy meal)…whereas my wife’s for comparison was 8.7mmol after an hour (which is probably a normal response)……i apologise this is a lot of information but I truly feel lost and for somebody who feels like they know a lot about nutrition and try’s to stay educated I don’t know what to do….my blood sugars are starting to cause issue to my day to day.

But the moment a female character has big boobs, a tiny waist, and a peachy butt—suddenly it’s a moral crisis about “unrealistic beauty standards.”

Let’s get one thing straight:

If we’re going to call out “unrealistic,” let’s be fully consistent.

In manhwas:
—The FL or MC is always dirt-poor or in massive debt.
—The ML is either a mafia boss, cold CEO, or some mysterious billionaire debt collector.
—And somehow, it all leads to true love.

Realistic? Not even close. And that’s the point! It’s fiction. It’s escapism.

We don’t read manhwas to study economics or biology. We read them to unwind, laugh, cry, and swoon over angsty love confessions and dramatic plot twists.

People need to stop forcing reality into every corner of fiction. Let readers enjoy their guilty pleasures in peace.

 Nothing deep. Just casual stuff — memes, reactions to stories.   
 Safe conversations. 

But it was the kind of casual that felt… loaded.   
 Like we were both pretending we weren’t thinking about that coffee.   
 That moment.   
 Her eyes. My hoodie.   
 That silence between sips. 

I didn’t want to push.   
 It’s not like I had a plan—I was just... there, floating with it.  
 But every time she replied — even just a “haha” or “same” —   
 it felt like I was slowly sinking deeper.

“Balik na ko sa Baguio this weekend.   
 Puntahan mo ko.” 

No “if you’re free.”   
 No smiley.   
 No warmth.

 I messaged her:

 Ordered something hot, just to hold something warm.   
 Still no reply.

But the truth is, I was just hoping for one thing:   
 A message.

 Then nothing.

 I took the available bus pa Manila.

 no music, no messages,   
 staring outside, sa kadiliman ng daan. 

It wasn’t just the no-show that stung the most.   
 It’s that she still texted me that morning.   
 It’s that I said yes.   
 It’s that I went. 

And it’s that I still hoped for an answer —   
 long after I knew I wasn’t going to get one. 

So I arrive sa apartment ng late na.   
 Didn't even bother to check the time.   
 Wala nang ilaw sa hallway.   
 Tahimik. Kulob. 

I left my bag by the door,   
 took off my shoes,   
 and just stood there for a bit —   
 like my body arrived,   
 but my mind was still on that café,   
 on that message na hindi dumating. 

I didn’t even bother turning on the lights.   
 Humiga lang ako sa kama,   
 hoodie pa rin suot,   
 I curled up sa kama, wishing the darkness would swallow me whole. 

Alam mo ‘yung pagod na hindi lang sa biyahe?   
 ‘Yung tipong kahit mahiga ka,   
 hindi ka naman talaga nagpapahinga? 

I didn’t bother to charge my phone.   
 Hinayaan ko na lang siyang mamatay.   
 Ayoko na ring basahin 'yung mga messages.   
 Wala namang bago.   
 Wala namang sagot.   
 At kung meron man —   
 huli na. 

So instead, I just lay there.   
 Eyes wide open.   
 Mind replaying everything —   
 that coffee,   
 that message,   
 that silence. 

And in the dark,   
 I realized something worse than being stood up. 

It’s being forgotten.   
 Quietly.   
 Painlessly.   
 Like I was the only one who thought this meeting mattered. 

No ending, just echoes.

1kidjw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1kidjw0/my_black_friend_faced_blatant_racism_during_his/,My black friend faced blatant racism during his trip to Southern Vietnam.,"Last year, I visited Vietnam and had an incredible time overall. Sure, I got ripped off a couple times in the North and Central regions, but the South was perfect. great service, really kind people, and one restaurant even gave me a free meal when I failed to explain that I couldn’t handle spicy food.

I came back raving about it to my coworkers. One of my closest work friends (he's black) took my advice and went with his family, but his experience was the total opposite. Ironically, the North and Central areas where I’d warned him to be careful ended up being fine for him. Not super welcoming, but at least people treated him fairly.

The South, however, was a disaster for him. On two separate occasions, he was called the N-word. Service was openly unfriendly, one coffee shop refused to let him stand nearby to access their Wi-Fi, despite him buying from it earlier. Strangers even covered their noses as he and his family walked past. Meanwhile, I’d been treated like royalty in the exact same places.

I was really confused, so I asked a Vietnamese acquaintance from the North about it. He told me Northerners generally treat everyone the same, no better treatment for me cuz I'm a white guy, but no extra hostility toward my black friend either. It was just their normal way of interacting with people. However, he also revealed that Southerners, while extremely welcoming to white people, are often racist toward black and brown folks, and sometimes even against their own Northern compatriots. so much that there's even a slur for them... For real??? A slur for your own countrymen??? Can anyone from Vietnam confirm this? Because that's one of the most insane things I've ever heard about any culture.

Now I feel like a privileged idiot for recommending the country base on my own experience.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

The kind that shows up on those “top 10 schools in the world” lists. I got in on a full scholarship—my golden ticket out, or so I thought.

But I feel like a fucking ghost here.

My friends drive BMWs and Teslas. They wear designer jackets like it's no big deal. They sip overpriced coffee between classes and casually order food like money is just… background noise. They talk about trips to Switzerland, buying watches, family yachts, goddamn ski trips. I smile. I nod. I laugh sometimes. I’ve gotten good at acting like I belong.

But I don’t.

I ride the bus to class and pray it’s not raining because my only pair of decent shoes leak. I eat the same $2 meals every day and pretend I’m not hungry when everyone goes out to eat. I make excuses—“Oh, I’m tired,” “Got a lot of work,” “Not feeling great.” It’s easier than saying “I can’t afford a burger, man.”

Do you know how humiliating it is to count coins in your dorm while your friends debate where to eat *this* weekend? Or to pretend you're “minimalist” because you literally can’t buy new clothes? I smile through it all, but inside, I’m just… tired.

I don’t even feel human sometimes. Just this hollow thing sitting in rooms I never thought I’d see, surrounded by people who don’t even realize I’m fading. It’s not their fault, I guess. How could they know what it’s like to panic over laundry money while their parents wire them $5,000 for “emergencies”?

I thought getting into this place would change my life. Maybe it did. But no one tells you how lonely it is to finally make it and still feel like you don’t deserve to breathe the same air. Like the universe let you in by mistake.

I don’t even want to go out anymore. I don't want to explain myself. I don’t want pity. I just want to stop feeling like surviving every day is some kind of performance.

It’s hard to admit, but I’m starting to hate the sound of my alarm clock. Because every morning, I wake up, and it all begins again—the pretending, the smiling, the lying. And no matter how well I play the part, I still go to bed hungry, both literally and… something deeper than that.

I don’t know why I’m posting this. Maybe I just needed to feel like someone might see me, even for a second.

Part 1 of things my 23 year old sister does that pisses me off or everyone else off. Name has been changed to protect her identity (at least I'm that nice)

THINGS THAT REBA DOES THAT PISSES ME OFF PART 1 OF MANY.

Reba has this annoying habit with her K-cups, specifically the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor. After brewing her coffee, she just leaves the used pod sitting on the counter instead of making a simple turn to toss it in the trash. Recently, she ran out of her precious Vanilla Ice Cream K-cups, which she hoards in her room, as she has purchased them, and unless you provide her with $0.90 to acquire one, she conceals them. I decided to use my own Light Roast K-cups, even though I don’t drink much caffeine, but when I do that's what I choose. I'm watching my supply dwindle, I can’t help but notice that the used K-cup that usually sits on the counter is mysteriously gone. It seems that when she’s using someone else’s coffee, she’s quick to throw it away to cover her tracks, but when it’s her own, she can’t be bothered to clean up. It’s frustrating to see such double standards in action!

Student at School of Computing and Data Science

Academic Secretary for All 3 Schools (2024,2025)

Academic Representative, SCDS (2023,2024)

Note: This response is written purely from my perspective as a student and is not influenced by any position I hold or by the university management. I’m responding here to ensure the facts are represented accurately and to provide first hand insights. If anyone has any doubts or needs further details about the university, feel free to reach out to me directly. I’ll be happy to provide more information and clarify any misunderstandings. Before addressing the points raised by so,called Mr.“Exposing\_Truth007” let me first share a few things that are important (Academics , food , and hostel ) to me and that I appreciate most about Sai University, which I believe provide a clearer picture of the actual experience here. Faculty and Research Culture: I've been studying here for over three years, and I have never faced any problems academically. My learning experience at Sai University has been exceptional, and the faculty members are highly qualified and worth learning from. Some professors are true gems , I feel extremely fortunate to study under their guidance. They are open to research ideas, always listening to students, and encouraging collaboration. I can walk into their office anytime, and they always respond to my emails promptly. No professor has been rude or dismissed any suggestions from me or my classmates. They are always kind and supportive, and I’ve even had the opportunity to sit with professors until 9 PM to clear all my doubts. Hostel and Food: No university in South India, and perhaps in most of India, offers such top,tier accommodations and food. Initially, we stayed in a hostel called Gokulam Park for two to three months, followed by a stay at Ocean Drive Villas in ECR for another three semesters. Both places were premium, offering 2BHK villas for four boys, air conditioned, with daily cleaning services. After the university built its own hostel, the facilities continued to be outstanding. We have separate flats, either 2BHK or 3BHK, with attached bathrooms, a medium sized hall, a small kitchen, a balcony, a washing machine, and air conditioning. The infrastructure at Sai University is better than most colleges in Chennai. The hostels are well equipped, and the transportation facilities are excellent , there are city buses to and from the campus every weekend. When it comes to food, the variety and nutritional value are unmatched. I exclusively eat the college food, and it fulfills all my dietary needs, including for those who work out. We get eggs for breakfast, plant based protein or paneer at lunch, and weekly chicken or egg for dinner. The food quality is excellent and meets all nutritional goals. If anyone doubts this, they can come to Sai U and have lunch with us , you’ll love it! In short, the faculty, hostel, and food here are more than what you’d expect from a top,tier university in this region.

For point 1 Yes, it is true that Sai University currently has two main academic buildings and one hostel block. We acknowledge this fact openly. However, it is important to understand the broader context before drawing harsh conclusions. Sai University is a relatively new and emerging institution. It was not created to generate profit or to mislead students and parents. In fact, the Chancellor has personally donated his wealth to build this university from the ground up. The intent behind this institution has always been to create a world class learning environment , and while we are still on that journey, progress is evident. Now coming to the concern about space: with approximately 350 students currently enrolled, the two buildings have been sufficient for academic activities, with at least three classrooms vacant during most hours of the day. The claim that 1,500 students are being admitted next year is a rumor, and nowhere has the management officially stated such a number. This assumption seems to be based on speculation rather than fact. That said, the administration and faculty are just as , if not more , concerned about ensuring quality and comfort for the students. When a new batch was admitted last year, and accommodation was tight, the management responded by renting out an entire apartment complex in Kelambakkam to house the students comfortably. That shows their willingness to take timely action. Yes, concerns exist. But the university is actively working on solutions. New infrastructure is part of the long term plan, and the process for expanding facilities is already underway. Let’s hold the university accountable, yes , but also support it when it is genuinely trying to grow with integrity. For Point 2

Let’s take a breather and clear up what “international faculty” actually means , because clearly, there’s some confusion floating around. No, it doesn’t just mean someone with a foreign passport. In higher education, “international faculty” commonly refers to those who: Have studied abroad, especially at the PhD or postdoctoral level.

Have worked in international institutions or been involved in global academic projects.

Bring internationally recognized academic standards and practices into Indian classrooms.

So yes, even if someone is Indian by birth, their international academic exposure still qualifies them as international faculty. This isn’t misleading , it’s the globally accepted norm in academic circles. Now, based on the claims made by the so,called “exposingtruth007,” I can clearly conclude that either they’ve not done any research or simply have no prior understanding of what constitutes international academic experience , To clear up any misunderstandings, here are several real, present, and active faculty members at Sai University whose qualifications and academic backgrounds prove otherwise:

Dr. Ajith Abraham – PhD from Monash University, Australia and Master of Science from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Dr. Subrata Dey – PhD from the University of Adelaide, Georgia State University and MA from wake forest University .

Dr. Ram Prasad K – PhD from Spain, Postdoc from Ireland, Director of VisionCog R&D

Prof. Subba Rao Toleti – Indo,German Postdoc, DSc in Biotechnology

Dr. Sindhuja Sankaran – PhD in Social Psychology from Cardiff University, UK

Siddhanth Prasad – Master’s from University of Cambridge, UK; also studied at NUS, Singapore

Prof. T S Gopi Rethinaraj – PhD in Nuclear Engineering from University of Illinois Urbana,Champaign

Prof. Saraswathi Krithivasan – PhD from IIT Bombay, MS from UMass Amherst

Zahida War – MSc from King’s College London, PGD from Ashoka University

Prof. Jamshed Bharucha – PhD from Harvard, former President of Cooper Union, USA

Prof. Sherman Teichman – Professor with significant U.S. education and experience

Additionally, visiting faculty from prestigious institutions have taught us valuable courses: Prof. Madhavan Mukund – Director, Chennai Mathematical Institute (taught DBMS)

Dr. S. P. Suresh – PhD from IMSc; Faculty at CMI

Rajeeva Karandikar – PhD from ISI Calcutta, ex,Director of CMI

Murugeswari Issakkimuthu – Postdoc from CMI, University of Wyoming

Kavita Sutar – Northeastern University

Mousumi Dutta – IIT Kharagpur

Neha Prabhu – PhD from IISER Pune, former faculty at IIT Bombay Moreover, Sai University also has some of the most skilled and knowledgeable faculty in their respective domains. For example, Prof. Ashok Chandrasekaran, who holds a PhD from Anna University, and Prof. Mariya Celin, with a Master of Engineering from SSN College of Engineering, are among the best when it comes to audio and speech technologies , both bring years of deep expertise and practical experience in these fields. And ,Prof. Ujjwal Verma, who completed his Master’s at IIT Palakkad, is known for his exceptional command over C programming and his strong foundation in mathematics, which is critical for both computer science and data science students.

Teaching Quality and Experience On a personal note, I am pursuing a dual degree,one from IIT Madras (BS in Data Science and Applications) and another from Sai University (majoring in Computing and Data Science). While both institutions offer similar courses, my experience at Sai University has been exceptional. The academic support here,from professors and fellow students,has been unmatched. I’ve had the privilege of working with renowned Tamil director Mysskin on his upcoming film Train in the IoT area, and I have secured over six topper badges in IIT Madras courses. With the guidance of professors like Ashok Chandrasekaran, I was able to publish a research paper in an IEEE conference on Quantum Machine Learning. I have also completed three internships during my first three years. While I had letters of recommendation from Sai University professors, I cleared all the interview rounds on my own, and I owe everything to the solid foundation and knowledge Sai University provided me. It's not just about me,over 8 students have published research papers during their undergrad years. For all of this, no one helped me except Sai University. To secure good marks in IIT Madras subjects, I relied solely on the courses offered at Sai University and the teaching methods they provide, which helped me outperform others. The knowledge I gained at Sai, the rigorous academic environment, and the support from professors have played a crucial role in my growth, both academically and professionally. Whether preparing for internships or excelling in my studies, Sai University has been a significant contributor to my success. In fact, I have found that the teaching methodology and faculty engagement at Sai University surpass those at many other institutions, including IIT Madras. The professors here are not only highly qualified but are also deeply committed to helping students with research, projects, and career guidance. Many students who specifically chose Sai University for its academic rigor can attest to the outstanding support we receive, which is often unmatched by other universities, including IITs or even NPTEL courses. Sai University offers a rich and updated curriculum that focuses on practical application. Professors engage us in both theory and hands-on projects, enabling us to gain real world experience while we learn. The academic freedom and opportunities for research in emerging fields like AI, Advanced Speech Technology, Quantum Computing, and Data Science are far beyond what many top,tier institutions offer. In conclusion, the faculty at Sai University, their qualifications, and their commitment to student development make Sai University stand out. I believe the educational experience here provides the best support for students focused on academic excellence and career growth. For Point 3 This claim is simply not true and misrepresents the actual admissions process at Sai University. From my own experience and that of many peers, Sai University follows a clear and structured admission process. When I applied, there was an interview stage that evaluated not just academic background, but also the student's interest, clarity of thought, and potential for growth. Additionally, merit based scholarships are awarded to students with strong academic records, proving that the university does recognize and reward quality. It's important to clarify that holistic admission doesn't mean ""no standards"". It means evaluating a candidate beyond just marks,looking at their interests, potential, and ability to grow academically and professionally. This is a globally accepted practice used by top universities around the world. Also, we’ve personally spoken to the university management about this concern. They clearly mentioned that there is no preference for quantity over quality. The goal is to maintain both diversity and academic strength,by admitting students who are not just academically capable, but who also bring different strengths to the table. As for the language barrier argument, let me give a real example. One of my close friends is from Andhra Pradesh and studied in a regional board school. His English skills were initially weak, but his understanding of algorithms, data structures, and core computer science concepts is excellent. Despite his language limitations, he currently holds a CGPA of 9.5 (without relative grading) and is among the toppers in courses like DSA, DBMS, and Data Analytics & Visualization. He even cracked multiple internship interviews on his own by the end of his second year. English fluency is not the only indicator of ability or success,this student proves that talent and hard work go much further. Sai University also supports such students through a collaborative environment where peer tutor learning, and accessible faculty(you can reach out to any faculty anytime ) this make everything easy In short, Sai University does not accept “anyone and everyone.” There is a proper admissions process in place, and many deserving, intelligent, and hardworking students are thriving here. The community is indeed diverse,not just in background but in goals and strengths. Like in any college, you will find students who are academically focused, some who are into sports or extracurriculars, and a few who are here just to get a degree. Since Sai U is a small and close, knit university, you might feel these differences more clearly. But this mix exists everywhere,even in large universities like SRM or VIT, where students also enter through management quotas. The difference is, that kind of management, seat culture doesn’t exist in Sai University.

For Point 4 Yes, it's true that Sai University doesn't currently have a full,fledged canteen or juice shop on campus, and the food poisoning incident did happen. But let’s look at the full picture. Last year, there was a third party vendor running a tuck shop inside the SaiU hostel serving burgers, sandwiches, chips, soft drinks, and ice cream. Unfortunately, the vendor failed to maintain basic hygiene, he didn’t replace old oil, eggs, and mayonnaise. This led to around six students falling sick due to food poisoning. The university immediately responded: the students were taken to the nearest hospital in Chettinadu and were well cared for. Even Chancellor Ramani Sir personally visited the students to check on their condition. The vendor was removed the very next day. After that, SaiU tried setting up a new tuck shop in the basement, offering snacks, beverages, stationery, and basic daily use products. The university didn’t charge any rent, hoping to support the vendor. But due to the small student population at the time, the vendor couldn’t make enough revenue to continue operations, this is a common challenge for small or growing campuses. That said, the management has confirmed that a new tuck shop will open next semester, now that the student strength is increasing, making it more viable for vendors. As for the claim that students have to walk 5 km to find food or fruit shops, that is simply not true. There are two local shops just 300 meters from campus, on both sides of the entrance, offering items like coffee, soft drinks, Maggi, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and daily use goods.

For fruits and groceries, Paiyanoor is just 2 km away, an easy walk with good scenery, and has shops, restaurants like Green Leaf, bakeries like Relax, and clean, hygienic food options.

For more variety, students can order from Vaaki Cafe through zomato with no delivery charge , which delivers to the hostel.

In fact, several student-run food services operate inside SaiU, offering meals and snacks with 30–45 min delivery. These are run by students, for students.

SaiU is still a young university, and like any new campus, it faces some logistical challenges .

For Point 5 Yes, the university's mental health counsellor did resign , but let’s look at what actually happened and why. There was a very serious case where a student was experiencing severe suicidal thoughts. In situations like this, it becomes a matter of student safety, not just confidentiality. The university management, as a precaution, requested the counsellor to share only the names of students whose mental health risk was categorized as high, medium, or low , not any private conversations, therapy notes, or personal details shared during the sessions. The management clearly stated that their intention was to be able to intervene early in high risk cases and inform parents only when necessary, especially if the student's safety was at immediate risk. They did not ask the counsellor to break any professional boundaries related to confidential conversations. In fact, in the serious case mentioned, the student’s parents were informed out of genuine concern , not to “protect the university's reputation,” but to protect the student’s life. If something tragic were to happen on campus or in the hostel, legal responsibility falls on the institution. The police and authorities would demand answers, and in those moments, the university must act responsibly. The counsellor, however, chose not to comply even with the request to share only the risk levels, which created a conflict. Due to this, she chose to resign.

For Point 6 Regarding placements , yes, it's true that the first batch has faced challenges, but let’s break down why that happened rather than just blaming the university. First, the current final year batch is quite small. Among them, a majority were focused on going abroad for higher studies , this includes students from both SAS and SCDS. So the number of students who actively opted for placements was already very low. The Career Services team did send job opportunities and encouraged students to apply. However, very few students actually applied, and even fewer were seriously preparing for these roles. Many preferred data science related positions, which are currently highly competitive and limited in the job market. Some companies did come for interviews, but since the number of applicants was low and performance in the interviews wasn't up to the mark, no one got selected. Also, big companies usually prefer coming to campuses with large final year batches so they get a return on their effort , so yes, SaiU’s batch size made it harder to attract major recruiters. That said, TCS was one company that did open applications and the career service had direct connections with them (3–4 LPA for SAS and 3–9 LPA for SCDS). Only a handful applied (3 from SAS, 6 from SCDS), but unfortunately, no one cleared the screening test . We fully acknowledge that SaiU didn’t provide enough placement training at the right time , this was partly due to not having a Vice Chancellor or Deputy VC during a critical period when planning was needed. The crash course that was offered later was too short and not very effective. But here’s the positive part: the current DVC and VC have taken this feedback seriously, and there’s already a plan in place to start structured, semester,long placement training for the next batch , covering resumes, aptitude, technical rounds, and mock interviews. So while the current situation isn’t perfect, improvements are being made, and the students still have opportunities , they just need to engage with them seriously.

For Point 7 Let’s get the facts straight. The board members don’t just show up once a year. At SaiU, there's an open board meeting every 3 months, and they regularly interact with the Chancellor, leadership, and faculty to discuss university progress. Honestly, tell us, in how many top universities do board members visit this often and stay directly involved with internal matters? Now, about the “waiter” comment , during events like convocation or high level meetings, students wear formal attire like blazers and ties. If that’s being called a “waiter’s outfit,” then by that logic, every senior executive in global companies would be a waiter too. And yes, students sometimes help with welcoming guests or coordinating during events. That’s not “seva”; that’s professional exposure, event management, and hospitality , all of which are valuable skills. Many of us feel proud to interact with top leaders like Narayana Murthy and learn directly from them. So if hosting guests respectfully and dressing professionally makes us “waiters,” then we’re proud to be the kind of waiters who are learning from the best .

For Point 8 Yes, sometimes semester transcripts or final results take time, but that’s not unique to SaiU; it's the case in many top universities across India, both large and small. However, at SaiU, once professors finish correcting the papers, you can directly check your marks with them , either in person or a few professors update it on the LMS , depending on the faculty. This means you often know your performance well before the final transcripts are issued. Many students even calculate their own grades based on the marking breakdown. When it comes to urgent needs , such as internship applications, exchange programs, or fellowships, the university has always supported students quickly. For instance, Gopi sir, the Controller of Examinations, has personally helped several students, including myself, by issuing official transcripts in just 1–2 days upon urgent request.

For Point 9

Let’s break this down honestly. If it were really true that 90% of the faculty hated the system, then by now we would’ve seen a mass exodus , but that hasn’t happened. The reality is more nuanced: many faculty members continue to stay and contribute meaningfully despite challenges because they believe in the university’s long term vision and academic values. And yes, for some, it's also because they haven’t yet found other institutions that offer a better fit for their research, teaching interests, or academic freedom , which is true at any university. It’s also important to understand that faculty turnover is a natural and expected part of academia, especially in young institutions still shaping their identity. Even in top global and Indian universities, be it Stanford, NYU, Ashoka, or the IITs, faculty come and go. That’s why you constantly see recruitment postings from the best institutions. If professors never left, those job openings wouldn’t exist. Yes, some well known names have moved on. But that doesn’t mean everyone has Plenty of qualified and passionate faculty have also joined, and students still have access to strong mentorship and academic guidance. So instead of reducing the narrative to ""who left"", it's more insightful to ask: who stayed, and why? As for the former VC, leadership changes are common in universities, and they don’t always reflect dysfunction. He moved on, and new leadership has stepped in to correct what went wrong. What matters now is whether the system is evolving, learning, and improving , and we are seeing signs of that happening. So let’s focus on the full picture, not just one, sided anecdotes. SaiU, like any growing university, is a work in progress, and many are still here, working every day to make it better.

For Point 10 Let’s be real , holding hands has never been a problem at Sai University. Students have walked around campus, in the Ocean Drive Villas, in the hostel pathways at night, in the student lounge , and no one has ever been expelled or even warned for simply holding hands. If that were the case, half the university would be expelled by now. But let’s not confuse liberal with lawlessness. SaiU gives students a lot of personal freedom , more than many private universities in India. But like any decent university, there’s a line between personal freedom and public indecency. If someone crosses that line, whether in behavior or inappropriateness in public spaces, the university has the right and responsibility to intervene, usually with a verbal or written warning. That is standard in every serious academic institution, even the international ones. And to Mr. “Exposing Truth” , it sounds like you want a university that supports and promotes indecency and immorality in the name of freedom. No respected university anywhere , whether it’s in the US, UK, or India , operates without limits. A university is an academic space, not a street, side club. If you truly care about student rights, please also acknowledge the freedoms we do have , because any third year student will tell you honestly: SaiU is one of the most liberal campuses in terms of student space, autonomy, and personal interaction. It’s only when students misuse that freedom that a response is triggered , and that’s not “moral policing,” that’s just basic campus conduct.

For Point 11

Sai University is still in its early stages of development, being a relatively new institution. That said, the basic sports infrastructure is in place, and improvements are actively underway. The sports field is currently planned to be repaired and renovated next semester, so any concerns about the quality of the playing surface are being addressed. As for the sports culture at SaiU, we’ve seen significant growth. Recently, the university completed a sports league with around 100 players participating across 4 teams in more than 5 sports, with trophies and other accolades awarded. The university is working to progressively enhance its facilities, and this league marks a milestone in the journey toward creating a more robust sports environment for students. Additionally, the SaiU Sports Society is planning to invite other universities, like Krea and Ashoka, for intercollege competitions, bringing more competition and diversity to the sports scene at SaiU. We can expect major improvements in the coming semesters, with increased participation from other colleges. As the university continues to evolve, we can expect more investments in facilities and a broader range of sporting opportunities. The journey is in its early phases, and every milestone brings us closer to the ideal sports experience for all students. For Point 13 The proof is in the pudding. In no other university would the DVC and VC meet with student representatives for over 4 hours to listen to their concerns and discuss future plans and improvements. This kind of engagement is rare and shows the university’s commitment to student feedback. While the Student Government is not officially recognized right now, this is due to recent administrative changes with the DVC and VC. The student representatives have only recently introduced themselves to the new leadership, and they’ve been actively engaged in meaningful conversations. The leadership has agreed to take steps toward formally recognizing the Student Council, with official processes for elections and governance planned for next semester. So, while things are still in transition, the fact that the DVC and VC spent hours listening to students is a clear sign that the university is working towards positive changes. This kind of accessibility is not common in most universities.

Alright, I’ve now addressed all the points where I actually have facts, not gossip. So instead of hiding behind anonymous posts and repeating the same stuff, here’s a wild idea: come talk to me directly. I’m in Sai University in the campus Hostel , yes, a real person with a real name and real responses. If you're on campus and really care about the truth, bump into me, stop me, ask me whatever you want , I won’t run. And if what you’ve said is 100% true, then why the cloak and dagger routine? Afraid someone might “catch” you for speaking the truth? Please. If you’re that scared, then still , come talk to me. I won’t reveal your name to anyone. Promise. You can also message me on LinkedIn (Arjun Thilak , [https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjun,thilak-17248a247/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjun,thilak-17248a247/) ) or get my number from the SaiU announcement group , it’s not hard. But let’s stop the anonymous whisper campaign and actually have a real conversation, if you’re up for it. Otherwise, keep posting from the shadows and pretending you're exposing something big , it’s entertaining, at least. Just keep in mind: badmouthing the university without understanding what’s actually going on behind the scenes doesn’t just affect the university , it affects the students who are working hard here, and it harms their reputation among recruiters and others outside. So if your goal is to ruin your own peers’ image while accomplishing nothing productive. Congrats!, mission halfway accomplished. But even if you write 1,000 more posts like this, it’s not going to change much, because the real changes are already happening, and most of what you've written isn’t even true to begin with.",0,1746779332.0,chennaicity,2,0.11,False

1kidhy3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kidhy3,Just finished Den-O. Here's my thoughts.,"Den-O is my second KR series and it's surprisedly amazing. I actually had no expectations. Probably the best heisei (phase 1) in my opinion.

I'm not big fan about time; past, present,future theme because it's twisting but they really change my perspective, I like sand clock references. The way they still use bike while having a train is kinda impressive.

Now, about Imagins. If I had to pick favorite, I would be Ryuutaros. He's childish and annoying... But that's the charms about him, being purple, gun form, silly. All other imajins have their portrayed but I love ryuutaros, the fact that he took ryuu from ryou'tarou is hilarious, like he's the main character. Loving nogami's sister is actually pretty cute and wholesome.
Here is my ranking:

Ryuutaros >Red oni >Odebu >Bear >Pervert turtle >Chicken Wing

Ryoutarou having all 4 imagins before ep10 is actually unnecessary but it's funny. Idea of shy, too kind, bad luck and weak rider is creative. It too good even I don't notice a filler episodes, it's so climax!

Belt opinion:
henshin sound is satisfying and addicted like sword and wing form. The design is simple.

Let me say this from a start...
Their second rider is actually great. Yuuto is a crappy dude but Deneb literally covering it. The fact that cards erase memory and itself after used is nice. Also having train is nice touched.

Climax Jump; Den-O opening is unskippable, their melody and lyrics is too good. I prefer DenLiner form of the song, Momo literally having a best vocal in the song (the full ver).

""Kokoro wo tsuyoku suru""
""Daji na kotoba to ka"" 

(ryuutaros rap part is also unnecessary cool)

Things that I hate:

Villlain
-the way Kai actually trick with his words is just... dumb. That's all I can say.

-Sieg
His design is the coolest than rest of the imagins but he's just pussy, no wonder Momotaros pissed off.

Their movies (Den-O movie: Ore Tanjou one) is little disappointed, only little bit. Perhaps the movie timeline is middle of the series or something similar like that. I actually interested early part in the movie but the rest is just casual, nothing special.
All other movies is actually masterpiece, I mean... Negataros, Skull form and Deneb meet more younger Yuuto is very nice and not boring.

The silly two guy in milk dipper is entertainment and very funny. Owner and coffee girl in DenLiner is same but they're more funny. And about the girl that's turn into a child? She punish the momotachi is actually pure comedy.


Wow, I really made a whole paragraph about Kamen Rider Den-O... Well, it's peak. I would recommend to watch it. Ore Sanjou! Mind if I reeled this references? This show has made me cry, wipe them with this! Mind if you give your thoughts? Can't hear you!",12,1746779324.0,KamenRider,5,1.0,False

I got him when I was 21 and couldn’t afford to move out of my parents house. I dealt with a lot of depression and I always told myself I had to get over my shit to take care of him. 

When we moved out to a few new cities, he was my routine and often my only companion. Every day we went on walks, did training exercises, played fetch. Now I just really miss him. 

He was pretty big. When he stretched out on the bed with me, he was basically human sized. When he was younger, this made him a lovable terror as he would go bowling for other dogs and sometimes people. He would also jump up, placing his paws on my shoulders to lick my face. Eventually he had to learn to be more gentle.

We lived in some rougher neighborhoods, and he intimidated some bad actors away but he was really a sweet heart. Every town we moved to, he became a local celebrity: the giant Doberman at the coffee shop, at grad school, walking to the park. He just made me feel safer and I felt better for taking care of him. 

Now I just wake up and he’s not there and the house feels so empty. My partner tries to console me but it’s like 13 years of depression are coming back now and I don’t know what to do with it all.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Two days a week i go to my parents house so i can get some help with my baby and my husband stays at home. If he eats he doesnt wash his plate or his cup or whatever he uses. He leaves them either next to the sink and most times at the table, in his game room and even in the bathroom when he drinks coffee and smokes cigarettes. His game room is like a pig lives there. I dont clean it and i dont plan on cleaning it. If he wants to play games in clean environment then he will clean it on his own but I guess he doesnt care. 

Even tho im not at home rn and he is, he texted me saying to do laundry when i get home. Then he texted me that he saw a cockroach in the bathroom and told me that the bathroom need to be cleaned and im thinking well you at home kill the bug and clean it. 

He has the mindset of most of eastern european men where the husband is the one that works and the wife takes care of the house and kids. He lies about how much money he makes cause i see how he’s spending money. He told me that his salary was cut like 65% but it doesnt seem like hes looking for a new job even tho he says he is. 

I never thought i would be over 30 with a useless husband. Im already checked out of this marriage and just focusing on my baby and myself. I dont know if my anger is speaking, am i overreacting or my feelings are valid but im so done with him.",14,1746778705.0,AskWomenOver30,17,0.71,False
1kidcwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1kidcwc/tata_neu_plus_hdfc_credit_card_is_an_absolute/,Tata Neu plus HDFC Credit Card is an absolute joke now – officially the most useless card I’ve ever had,"Bad just became worst. I’ve had this Tata Neu card for over 2.5 years and honestly, it’s been trash from day one — no cashback, no useful vouchers, NOTHING. The only reason I kept it was for the 4 domestic and 2 international airport lounge accesses. That’s it.

Even then, I had to pay 500 bucks annually for practically nothing in return. But hey, lounges were worth it — or so I thought.

Today I get a message saying it’s now going to be milestone-based. If I want those damn lounges, I need to spend 50K every 3 months. My card limit is 50K/month, and like a responsible adult I barely use 30% of it (around 15K) to keep my credit score in check.

Now you’re telling me I have to max out my card or spend unnecessarily just to maybe qualify for a bloody lounge visit? You want me to screw my credit score over a few cups of airport coffee and some Wi-Fi? Absolutely not.

This card is now officially the most useless card in my wallet. Hell, it barely had any utility before, and now it’s just straight-up insulting.

Cancelling it ASAP.
