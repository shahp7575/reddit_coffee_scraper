**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1iv7bd4/i_dont_like_my_new_baby_at_all/)**: February 21, 2025**

I (30F) recently had a baby. This is my second child, and my first child with my husband (31M).

I thought I'd love this baby with all my heart, considering my husband and I have an insanely wonderful relationship. He has also taken in my first child like his own, and we have a perfect family. But truthfully? I can't stand this baby.

My firstborn is perfect in my eyes. Clever, beautiful, well behaved. I love spending time with her. She is my soulmate of babies. Even as a newborn I absolutely adored her.

This baby, another girl, just ain't it. Even the pregnancy was terrible. The childbirth was terrible. Everything about her is just awful. She cries nonstop. She's not as cute as my firstborn. She spends all of her awake time being pissed off. She's 8 weeks old, and I spend my days just waiting for my husband to get home so I can give her to him.

I haven't told him about this either, because this is his only baby. I'm sure in his eyes, she's a perfect little angel.

Of course I'll never act on anything. Anytime she cries I respond, I love on her, talk to her, treat her just as I would my firstborn. Even when nobody is around, I love on this baby the way a baby needs to be loved. Smiles. Kind voices. Cuddles. Kisses. Everything.

Im just so over this kid. Maybe if I could spend 5 minutes of my time with her without her screaming in my face maybe I could bond. Even when she's not crying, she just ignores me. I hate everything about this, and really don't care for this baby. And I'll take this secret to the grave with me, but I really wish my heart had room for this kid.

EDIT BELOW: I wasn't expecting this to blow up. I will post an update in a few months. Hopefully a positive one. A few notes though:

Before jumping to a ""poor baby"" ""terrible mother"" bs, please do research. This is not uncommon for a mom to not bond. I'm just the ballsy one to say it on reddit on a throwaway account.

She is not abused, she is the light of my husband's life. She is always in OUR arms. Her big sister is OBSESSED and absolutely ADORES her baby sister. If anything, I spent all my waking hours TRYING to bond with her, so this little one gets EXTRA cuddles and attention. I don't ""hate"" the baby. I just don't like her. I don't wish anything bad on her.

For those asking: No, we have absolutely no support. No friends, no family, as this is a new city for us. I haven't even slept in my own bed since her birth, as my husband works 60 hours a week and he can't function with Baby waking him up. I haven't had a 4 hour long sleep since her birth. I haven't been able to cook a meal in 8 weeks. I'm lucky if I get a 10 minute shower.

Yes, I'm in therapy/been working with a doctor for PPD. Yes, baby is seeing a doctor for possible reflux issues/milk allergy and we are currently trying a specialized formula.

Commenter: you need to see a therapist before you take this petty hatred you have for this innocent baby out on her.

“she’s not as cute” very weird thing to say and list as a reason as to why you don’t like your baby as much. blame yourself and your husband for that if anything. if we’re being real.

“she cries nonstop” I don’t know if you know this but she can’t use actual words and communicate with and who knows she could have underlying issue but she obviously can’t communicate that. crying is all she has??

“doesn’t pay attention” she was just fucking born??? what do you mean? her attention span hasn’t even developed yet

>**OOP:** I would never take anything out on her. I am capable of separating my thoughts and annoyances from her. Nothing is her fault, she is perfection just as she is. Which is why I treat her with absolute kindness and affection.  
I actually have a therapist, though nothing is working yet. I also have a degree in psychology/childhood education, and am very well versed in development.  
She is allowed to cry as much as she wants. She is allowed to be as needy as she wants. She is allowed to be whoever she's born to be. I will respond to her and make sure she is healthy and happy, as that is my job. She gets everything my firstborn did, and all the love a baby needs. She is a precious little human being, and even with my disconnection from her emotionally, I realize that.  
This post was merely to get off my chest some thoughts as a healthy way of coping. Like a diary.

Top Commenter: I know what this turns into if left untreated. My mother felt this way about me when I was a baby because it was a high risk pregnancy, and I had sleep apnea. All the stuff OP is talking about, I felt it from a young age--how repulsed she was of me and how relieved she was to pass me off to my father. I always knew that she didn't like me, starting around four years old. When I was in high school, she even told me that she wished she'd never had me. People had different attitudes around mental health back then, so I don't consider it anyone's fault. Even with help, maybe this is just something that just happens. But either way I've never had a mother's love, and I don't talk to my mom anymore.

>**OOP:** That's sad :( I'm hoping therapy/time will help this. It's not a lack of trying, that's for sure. But some other comments are giving me hope :)  
I'm definately going to keep trying to develop that bond and connection. I'd hate for her to grow up feeling that way. I'm sure it will click in place eventually.

Commenter: You may need medication - talk to your doctor and be frank. My SIL felt this way about niece #1 after a hard pregnancy and birth, and it was 100% PPD and has rippled through their relationship for the past 10 years.

>**OOP:** 10 years? My god. We are already trying medication and therapy. I refuse to let this linger like that. That's horrible :(

Commenter (downvoted): ""Even when she's not crying. She just ignores me."" Seriously? Is this some kind of joke?

I wonder why you had a baby you don't love when there are a lot of women who are sterile.

Poor baby. Being blamed for behaving like a baby! When she's actually a newborn!

>**OOP:** This is why moms struggle to reach out during periods of PPD. You are why people can't be honest about their mental health issues, and instead feel judged.  
Believe it or not this baby came into the world and I was fully expecting to feel that initial wave of love. That didn't happen. And I'm fixing it. Because I have the knowledge, resources, and thick enough skin to deal with people like you.  
But there will be some 18 year old mom who doesn't realize feelings like mine are normal, and mean PPD or mental issues. They will feel so much guilt for not loving their baby. And I hope they don't run into people like you.

Commenter: Other folks are offering really great advice around seeking medical support (and it sounds like you're already on that!), so I just wanted to offer a narrative re-framing - you have two children, one who clicks naturally with you and aligns with you. You vibe easily, and that's beautiful. But your second daughter might be the one to help you see things in new ways, offer a different approach, challenge you, bring fresh and outside perspectives. Of course that will be clearer as she starts to get older, and it's totally fair that right now feels deeply challenging. I wish you luck and deep resources of patience while you move through this phase!

>**OOP:** Aww. I'm going to save this comment. That's such a wonderful way to think about it. Actually made me tear up a little. Thank you <3<3

*Husband:* 

>I really should have specified. My husband does an incredible job. He has taken off days when I'm really struggling. I had a breakdown and he was home in 10 minutes. He would skip out on sleep if I let him. He is the partner any mom would dream of having. He's giving me a break from the baby as I'm typing this. He skipped out on part of his shift tonight because after reading these comments, I told him I needed to talk to him.  
He usually does leave meals for me in the fridge. Part of my struggling is I'm not feeling hungry often. Part of my struggling is I don't vocalize when I need him more, out of guilt. Part of my struggling is I push him away when I'm feeling down. Those are things I'm working on in therapy, and I know at any point I could ask for help and he'd do anything. It's a me problem, and a me problem from my previous relationships. I'm working on it, and I've made a lot of progress. I made even more tonight by confiding in him about my feelings.  
But you're right about everything you said, I do need to rely on him more. And it will get easier with the smiles and interactions. Thank you, internet stranger:)

**BriCheese96:** Do you think it’s possible you have postpartum depression? I think you should talk to your doctor about these feelings.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jhj1ez/update_i_dont_like_my_new_baby_at_all/)**: March 22, 2025 (1 month later)**

About a month ago I made a post about how much I didn't like my newborn. She was 8 weeks old.

Well a few days later I took her back to the doctor. He put her on dairy free formula, Alimentum (Which smells like potato stroganoff. Ew). The changes started overnight, and the very next day, I woke up and looked in her basinet to see an awake baby giving me the biggest, cheesiest smile in the world. Since then her personality has shown through drastically. It's honestly really fun to witness. My husband has also been an enormous help. Reassuring, letting me sleep, helping every moment he can. He also went back down to a normal amount of hours at work, to help me more.

It's still rough. She still doesn't sleep fully through the night. I consider her being a little more of a firecracker to be part of her personality, she might never be as easy as her sister. But I wouldn't change her if I could. Her sister and her are night and day, totally different. But I can honestly say I love it. I love having one angel, and one fired up rebel.

Having this little semen demon smiling at me really changed so much in my head. Even in the worst moments I know she loves me, and I just melt over her. She's got the most beautiful smile in the world, along with all her hilarious angry faces.

To anyone else going through what I did, give yourself some grace. This phase will pass. Her turning a page development wise, plus SSRIs for PPD, have absolutely changed our relationship. I can very honestly say I no longer have a favorite child. They're both incredible. <3

Edit: all hateful messages will be responded to with cat gifs, and nothing else. Thanks for your time, keep it moving. <3

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Top Commenter: Potato stroganoff is being generous to the smell of Alimentum. It's the smell of nightmares. I'm so happy your baby is doing well on it. It was a game changer for us too

>**OOP:** It's so bad. If I hold her too long, she sweats on me and I smell of moldy cheese the rest of the day.

Commenter: I hope it doesn’t keep you from holding her as much as she needs. I remember your first post, I’m so glad you have a positive update ☺️

>**OOP:** On the contrary, the bigger she gets the more of a velcro baby she is! She's always in my arms... and i always smell like cheese :(

Commenter: I’m glad you ALL are getting the much needed help.

However keep in mind that babies not sleeping through the night at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, even a year or longer is developmentally appropriate. I promise I’m not trying to ad on to your stress but comparing her to her sister, even starting this young and in a way you think she doesn’t understand, will cause resentment.

>**OOP:** Oddly i don't mind so much anymore. With Hubby giving me naps I'm not as hopeless when I'm woken up in the night. Plus she's very easy to soothe. Sometimes she just wants to see if I'm still there I think. I'm okay if this persists for a long time. :)

Commenter: \[...\] Girl. You got this. The comments on your other post had me reeling... I typed so many replies and deleted them. Except one. One sanctimommy said that you 1st was gonna be the golden child and the baby wouldn't be loved as much and all this crap. So. I asked since she could see the future if I could have the winning lottery numbers... I'm pretty sure I won't get them tho 🤣

>**OOP:** There was a lot of replies i typed out too, but end of the day it's not even worth it. Internet strangers love to judge. I gave in to the ""put the baby up for adoption"" one. *\[editor's note- didn't include that comment b/c it pissed me off to read it and see it was upvoted at the time\]*  
There's so many unsaid things from parents, because of the pressure to be perfect. Truth is I've raised my first born off of coffee, Lunchables, and google. And she's awesome. This second one has coffee, Lunchables, google, and my previous experience. It'll be okay. :)",2,1743221509.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,1,1.0,False

I was a 3ish cups in the morning type of guy. One on the drive to work. One when I arrived and maybe a top off after that. I’m 44 years old and have been drinking coffee every morning since I was THIRTEEN.

I cannot believe how smoothly my attitude towards my day goes. There’s little to no anxiety at work. I don’t stress about all the things I have to do. I just DO them. I’m not worrying about what’s ahead. I’m completely calm speaking to people that used to stress me out. I’m not spiralling on problems in the shower when I wake up.

When I wake up and I’m driving to work, I just feel awake. I’m not groggy. It was the drug controlling my life all along. It was the drug causing mood swings, stress, elevated heart rate, dry skin, etc.

Thank you to all of you for your “Stay strong” posts. Seriously. The first week was brutal to stay off, but I’m cruising now. I don’t miss it. I don’t want it in my body.
I will say not having a ritual in the morning is odd. I just get up & go, drinking my basic-ass water.

1jme5fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1jme5fi/wtf_is_she_doing/,Wtf is she doing?,"I work with this bpd ""friend"".

 It constantly a mind f--ck. We were super good friends at first but then one day everything changed. What I thought was a great friendship turned into nothing overnight. She teases me with evenings out or lunches out and never follows through and bails out last minute or goes out with someone else. When I bring this stuff up to her she makes it sound like I'm the crazy one. I'll give some examples of what has happened:

1. I had dinner plans with her and she canceled last minute so she could take her other friend out for a drink for his birthday. My birthday was a few weeks later and I got nothing except she went to lunch at the same time as me and rubbed it in my face she went home just to wash dishes rather than do anything with me.

2. I worked on her car for free just being a friend and there was a present on the passenger seat that caught my eye. When I asked about it she said it was for another coworker just because they are so good to her. I said just get me a coffee for payment for working on her car. She made me go to Starbucks to get it and she sent me to the wrong store tonpic it up.

3. Fast forward a year layer and she ""forgot"" my birthday but felt like she intentionally made my day hell at work for no reason.

I have tried to not talk to her. She moved to another department and I finally was able to go no contact for almost a year. She actually ended up quitting and I was free. We had a opening and guess who my manager hired back....

It feels like the world's shittiest friendship. Every time I try to walk away she's up in my face wondering what's wrong and acting like she's my best friend then the friendshit gets a bandaid for 3 days and it all starts up again.

I see her burried in her phone all day every day. I know I'm not the only smuck. This is a friend I truly loved but have realized I'm just one of the other dozen Pokémon cards she keeps in shuffle.

What the hell does she want from me? It makes no damn sense. Stop acting like I'm your best friend one minute just to kick me in the balls the next. I feel like I'm one of those voodoo dolls and she just keep stabbing me in the eye with a needle.",1,1743221327.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

1jme36b,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1jme36b/first_panic_attack_in_a_long_time_and_just_wanna/,First panic attack in a long time and just wanna whine about it.,"Granted this panic attack might have been my fault. I indulged on a little too much coffee because I was power cleaning my house and also super tired because we stayed up kind of late. And I hadn’t taken my Lexapro in 2 days (first day I simply just forgot and yesterday I had some whiskey when we had dinner and didn’t wanna mix the medicine with alcohol) so I truly believe I caused this panic attack. But still… it sucked. 

I was having a really good day. I keep my house really clean all the time as it seriously helps my anxiety but there was some deep cleaning and organizing I wanted to get done so I drank 3 cups of coffee from around 10:00am-3:00pm. Which is way more than the usual 1 cup I have in the morning. And then about 4:30, I started getting a pounding headache. Then my heart started racing. Then my brain started to slow down. I couldn’t read words, I couldn’t speak right. Then my hands started going numb. I’ve been through this a billion times before but my brain still jumps to “probably a stroke” every single fucking time. And I hate it. Deep down I know it’s a panic attack but my brains like “nope. This is the one where it’s actually a stroke” which just sky rockets the anxiety and panic every time. I took my Klonopin, and walked over to my moms house (thank god she’s my neighbor) and we took my blood pressure which was of course high (it always is when having a panic attack) and then we went through my whole routine. Guided breathing exercises, hydrating, and just trying to talk through it. Everything started to get better and I was able to get out my coloring books and color while the lingering physical sensations of panic attacks subsided. (If you haven’t tried coloring while fight off panic episodes, I highly recommend it) 

After a while I felt good enough to come home and climb into bed where I did some more guided meditating and fell asleep for a while. I did wake up with a splitting headache still but I’m hoping I’m just a little dehydrated and overly caffeinated. So I’m gonna drink a few bottles of water and maybe go watch one of my comfort movies. 

But ya’ll, it sucks. My panic attacks have been under control for some time now with the help of Lexapro and Klonopin. And I’ve felt really good about life. I know I’ll feel better tomorrow but I’m feeling pretty down about myself. It’s hard for me to accept that my panic disorder is most likely a lifelong battle because I’ve already dealt with it for most of my life. I don’t know, I just wanna feel sorry for myself in the current moment. 😞",2,1743221095.0,PanicAttack,0,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.askamanager.org/2025/01/my-coworkers-have-way-more-money-than-me-and-they-constantly-expect-me-to-shell-out-cash-for-meals-and-gifts.html)  **Jan 28, 2025**

I work in a government agency that’s very analogous to a private sector industry (think trade vs. banking or procurement vs. real estate) and many of my colleagues have either joined us after having made plenty of money on the private side or are otherwise independently wealthy. Our senior leadership are politically appointed multimillionaires. I enjoy my work, but I seem to be one of the few who works here because I actually need the money. I have no complaints about my salary; we all make the same. However, I’m paying back student loans that won’t budge and I also have the only single income family in our department.

Generally, but especially this past holiday season, these folks have gotten deep into my pockets. To illustrate: our boss was out sick and my colleagues took up a collection to have a grossly overpriced snack basket sent to his home. I’m not just being dramatic; I made a bigger gift basket on the same theme that cost me a tenth what we paid for our boss’s present. Another colleague took some time off for a procedure and the group organized daily DoorDash deliveries until he returned. After contributing to those, I’ve had to take a serious step back from participating in things, and I worry that people are starting to think of me and stingy and antisocial.

I’m actually a very generous person and giving gifts is my love language. But I cannot afford to be wasteful. For example, to congratulate a coworker on her promotion, I made her a little gift bag with a pound of her favorite coffee and a candle I knew she’d like. But I didn’t feel comfortable giving it to her after her successor asked us each to put $50 toward a coffee- and candle-themed gift basket for her with a footnote that “I know it’s pricey, but come on, she deserves it!” I had to sit out of another colleague’s farewell lunch at a Michelin-starred restaurant. I simply can’t drop that kind of cash on a random Thursday though I would’ve happily treated him to sushi or pizza.

I did anxiously attend our self-pay “holiday lunch” (we voted on restaurants, but the most expensive one won out). I studied the menu in advance and carefully selected a semi-affordable dish (and was sure not to eat of the appetizers and whatnot that people ordered “for the table”) but when the bill came everybody just said, “You know what? It’s Christmas! Let’s just split it!” Reading the room, I felt there was no real way I could push back on that in the moment. My heart sank at first and then fully broke when one of the attendees was unable to pay — I think her card was acting up — and one of my coworkers assured her, “It’s no problem, we’ll cover you!” Sometime later, she went around offering to reimburse people and I overheard several people tell her a version of, “Oh, please! Don’t worry about it; it was just a few dollars.” It was not just a few dollars, and I pushed past my embarrassment to accept her offer as I really did need my money back.

I want to preserve my office relationships, but dropping hundreds of dollars a month doing so is simply not an option for me. What practical advice do you have for people experiencing a disposable income mismatch with coworkers who highly value team socializing and joint gift-giving?


[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2025/03/update-my-coworkers-have-way-more-money-than-me-and-they-constantly-expect-me-to-shell-out-cash-for-meals-and-gifts.htm)  **March 20, 2025 (2 months later)**

Thanks for posting my letter and for your advice a while back. I have a somewhat unsatisfying update.

The gift-giving has slowed down considerably, presumably because the federal workplace isn’t exactly festive at the moment. However, the original issue recently showed up in a different form. Our office admin offered to put together (what I understood to be) a no-host happy hour as a send-off event for a colleague who recently got DOGE’d. (Note: I understood it to be a no-host event because that is the norm for our field. In fact, when I first arrived they held a welcome happy hour for me, and everybody, including me, paid their own bill.) I truthfully mentioned that I had a schedule conflict that would have caused me to only be able to stay a few minutes and she told me how important it was that I show up for the laid-off coworker and at least come say goodbye. I saw her point and showed my face.

I was the second person to arrive at the venue. The first person to arrive (the same colleague from my last letter who is always declaring “let’s just split it!” and “Jane doesn’t have to pay, we’ll all cover her”) had already ordered a spread of appetizers and a bottle of her own favorite spirit. I mentioned that I wouldn’t be ordering anything because I had to rush out right away. Once the rest of the group had arrived and the server took orders, I again announced, “Nothing for me, since I have to leave early.”

Over the weekend, the same lady copied me to an email explaining that the bill had come to nearly $400 and assigning us all a portion that we’d need to send her. Apparently, she put the whole thing on her credit card and is looking to be reimbursed. I didn’t respond since I obviously racked up $0 of this outrageous bill. Seriously, how many $6 cocktails and $7 flatbreads could six humans possibly have ordered in 120 minutes?? Anyway, my husband told me that in times like these, it’s more important than ever to be viewed as a team player lest I be added to the “chopping block,” which is our name for the Elon-requested list of of individuals whose jobs can safely be cut. So, on Monday I reached out to her and reminded her that I didn’t order/consume anything but could still chip in a bit for team spirit. She responded with a fixed amount that she expected each attendee to pay — about twice the amount I had in mind — and followed up saying, “I know this feels unfair since you didn’t eat, but since we hosted Bob, you can think of it as your portion of the cost of his going-away party.”

First of all, we as a team, absolutely did not agree to “host” a going-away party for Bob. And at any rate, that’s not how any of this works. I do not know why this one person gets to just invent this nonsense reimbursement system in which she pays what she wants and assigns the rest of us to cover the rest regardless of our actual consumption. She eventually followed up with a second email to me only saying, “Of course, if you prefer not to contribute, I understand,” to which I projected some snark that may or may not have been intended. I Venmo’d her the amount I was comfortable with and vowed to never spend any time with these folks outside the office ever, ever again. This may not be an issue much longer as I’m informed that my entire office is slated to get DOGE’d in the next couple of weeks. Some folks are being reassigned and some are being axed entirely.

My takeaway from the happy hour experience is that my team’s earlier behavior had nothing to do with rich people being out of touch with most people’s spending-related norms and simply needing me to bring it to their attention. Since: (1) my colleague was fully aware that I didn’t eat or drink, but still spelled out that I need to pay 1/5 of the bill, and (2) remarked that it may “seem unfair” for me to subsidize everyone else’s excesses and encouraged me to view it a different way as though I am the one with a perception problem, it seems to me that it was always a matter of unreasonable people feeling entitled to my money.

I (23M) and my gf (23F) have been together for 1 year. It’s been poetic to say the least, from both sides. She is lovely, very kind and compassionate, very loving to myself and my son. Gets along swimmingly with my family and hers with me as well. We have never yelled at each other, we are wonderful communicators and always solve the problems together. I can confidently say up until recent we had no true issues. 

About 5 weeks ago, I found out an incident that had happened with a coworker of ours that happened much before we had met. Maybe 2 years ago, give or take (Just to clarify, they never slept together only 2 dates and he pursued her for about a year while married, ending in his wife divorcing him). While it’s not a huge deal to me and Im not one to judge anyone’s past, I had specifically asked upwards of 7-8 times if anything had ever happened concerning this specific coworker. I didn’t care of feel threatened but ever since he found out her and I were together his attitude towards me did a complete 180. We went from friendly and talkative.. to short, pointed and very odd remarks about my gf. 

This threw me off an I had specifically asked about this behavior and if there is anyway she could help me understand the sudden change. She never alluded to this issue and was adamant that nothing ever happened. Well turns out another person had their suspicions of something that had happened and finally I pressed her a little further as my gut was telling me that wasn’t the full truth. It turns out that all it was and like I said I couldn’t care less, but it really dampened the trust I had built in her. 

I decided to break it off then and let sleeping dogs lie. Up until this point I have never had anxiety attacks or knots outside of drinking too much coffee. But that night I felt sick, like I had taken it too far and that I was seriously walking away from something that is repairable. I brushed it off and didn’t reach out. She pursued me unwaveringly for 3-4 days and even broke down at work multiple times because of it. Finally she met me after work 4 weekends ago (roughly 4-5 days after this event) and gives me a very long letter. In this letter I was blown away by  everything she thought. She held nothing back and never did anything but admit wrong doing and never made an excuse for her actions. 

On top of my truly believing to my core that I had made a mistake and praying about it, I decided to slowly take steps to reconciliation. Everything was great, she kept true to all her commitment and promises and truly opened up more about everything I could possibly find out or that may hurt me in the future (nothing I didn’t already know). This lasted and was great but everyday I was questioning her silently, I wouldn’t say anything other than I slowly realized I still didn’t trust her. I didn’t fully believe everything she said and always felt like I was looking and searching for an out or to be right. Finally I pulled the trigger last night after we agreed to spend today with each other and head into work Saturday from my home. 

Once I sent the text, I was very polite but to the point that my lack of trust in her was wavering and that I didn’t think I could do this with her but I still did very much love her. About 35 minutes later she started to frantically call me and asked to come in and that she was at my house. I let her in and we were very quiet for a while until the silence grew painful. She asked and begged me to ‘jump’ for her and to let her show me that everything she said was true and pure. While I truly love her I was hesitant to take that huge leap of faith after I already had and it had been broken. After a few hours of very respectful talking and communication, we agreed that we jump together. I agreed not to attempt to leave again just because I’m still hurting and she agreed to be transparent and honest and help rebuild. She then spent the night and planned to go home in the morning, pack a bag and continue our plans. This would have taken a total of 2 hours max. 

When she got home she went AWOL, absolute silence. Then sends me a very shocking text that she’s very in love with me and that she loves us but doesn’t like the cycle of rinse and repeat we seem to be starting. I ask to meet and she agrees, it turns out when she made it home her sister sat her down and told her that they are concerned because of her frantic and late departure three times to my home in the past month to make sure we didn’t split up. 

When we met she explained that she needed space and that she wanted to be able to breathe and that she feels as if she’s begging me to love and trust her. We have polar opposite responses to this specific issue, hers being to cling tighter and mine being to walk away fairly quickly and without warning. I understand that I’ve also made the mistake of giving her no reason to trust that I won’t walk away again. After promising the first time I won’t, doing it abruptly one night and then agreeing again that I’d take that leap of faith with her once more.

The part I need advice on:
She asked for space, not a break or to break up but just space from each other for a bit. She asked to keep our locations on, we set ground rules to stay exclusive and trust that our loyalty will not waver in the time being. She agreed we will keep up some sense of normalcy, such as being our normal selves at work, occasional texting and checking in and maybe spending a few hours a week eating out or going to the park. She wasn’t very specific on a timeframe but did say she thinks it’s best we take anywhere from 2-6 weeks to both determine our best relationship-repair tools and tactics then resume us and put an end to this cycle. I agreed, not very willingly and have again turned into a slight ball of anxiety. She’s never given me a reason to doubt her loyalty only her trust. But asked that for at least the first 48 hours refrain from texting and both just relax and breathe. 

In my mind I don’t necessarily see this as super healthy as communication in solving the issue together is the common goal, not ignoring the problem and each other. I also think we both have cracks in the foundation of trust for different reasons that this break may not fix.

Am I wrong in believing that we maybe signing the relationships death warrant?


I also at least plan on waiting until first contact to communicate to her but thought that similarly writing a letter conveying all my thoughts, feelings and strategies would be optimal so that she understands this is not one sided and that I want this at bad as she does.

Does this sound like a poor idea?


I did at one point ask for space after the initial break up and that was the 3-4 days I mentioned earlier, to which she sadly agreed to. When I reinitiated contact and brought some normalcy back into our lives, that’s when she gave me the letter she had wrote the first day of the break up.

Should I wait out the silence and give her the space she wants? 
Should I make one last stand and effort to form healthy repair strategies with her and keep moving forward?
Should I quietly or verbally let this relationship go? 

To reiterate, even now I don’t doubt the love and choice of daily love we have for each other. She was very emotional asking for time and seemed to be hurting bad when starting the conversation but also seemed extremely optimistic that this was going to be good for us and that us proving to each other that I can trust her word and she can trust my commitment, we will flourish. She also agreed with my sentiment that this wasn’t enough to fix the issue but a start. But I do have a slight feeling that while her emotions were all genuine, the ‘fix’ to our issues was regurgitated and not actually her own personal wants. It seemed very against our entire relationship up until this point and the way we solve our issues.

I’ll try to keep it short as I can but I want to give as much detail so I can have proper feedback. I (23M) and my gf (23F) have been together for 1 year. It’s been poetic to say the least, from both sides. She is lovely, very kind and compassionate, very loving to myself and my son. Gets along swimmingly with my family and hers with me as well. We have never yelled at each other, we are wonderful communicators and always solve the problems together. I can confidently say up until recent we had no true issues. 

About 5 weeks ago, I found out an incident that had happened with a coworker of ours that happened much before we had met. Maybe 2 years ago, give or take (Just to clarify, they never slept together only 2 dates and he pursued her for about a year while married, ending in his wife divorcing him). While it’s not a huge deal to me and Im not one to judge anyone’s past, I had specifically asked upwards of 7-8 times if anything had ever happened concerning this specific coworker. I didn’t care of feel threatened but ever since he found out her and I were together his attitude towards me did a complete 180. We went from friendly and talkative.. to short, pointed and very odd remarks about my gf. 

This threw me off an I had specifically asked about this behavior and if there is anyway she could help me understand the sudden change. She never alluded to this issue and was adamant that nothing ever happened. Well turns out another person had their suspicions of something that had happened and finally I pressed her a little further as my gut was telling me that wasn’t the full truth. It turns out that all it was and like I said I couldn’t care less, but it really dampened the trust I had built in her. 

I decided to break it off then and let sleeping dogs lie. Up until this point I have never had anxiety attacks or knots outside of drinking too much coffee. But that night I felt sick, like I had taken it too far and that I was seriously walking away from something that is repairable. I brushed it off and didn’t reach out. She pursued me unwaveringly for 3-4 days and even broke down at work multiple times because of it. Finally she met me after work 4 weekends ago (roughly 4-5 days after this event) and gives me a very long letter. In this letter I was blown away by  everything she thought. She held nothing back and never did anything but admit wrong doing and never made an excuse for her actions. 

On top of my truly believing to my core that I had made a mistake and praying about it, I decided to slowly take steps to reconciliation. Everything was great, she kept true to all her commitment and promises and truly opened up more about everything I could possibly find out or that may hurt me in the future (nothing I didn’t already know). This lasted and was great but everyday I was questioning her silently, I wouldn’t say anything other than I slowly realized I still didn’t trust her. I didn’t fully believe everything she said and always felt like I was looking and searching for an out or to be right. Finally I pulled the trigger last night after we agreed to spend today with each other and head into work Saturday from my home. 

Once I sent the text, I was very polite but to the point that my lack of trust in her was wavering and that I didn’t think I could do this with her but I still did very much love her. About 35 minutes later she started to frantically call me and asked to come in and that she was at my house. I let her in and we were very quiet for a while until the silence grew painful. She asked and begged me to ‘jump’ for her and to let her show me that everything she said was true and pure. While I truly love her I was hesitant to take that huge leap of faith after I already had and it had been broken. After a few hours of very respectful talking and communication, we agreed that we jump together. I agreed not to attempt to leave again just because I’m still hurting and she agreed to be transparent and honest and help rebuild. She then spent the night and planned to go home in the morning, pack a bag and continue our plans. This would have taken a total of 2 hours max. 

When she got home she went AWOL, absolute silence. Then sends me a very shocking text that she’s very in love with me and that she loves us but doesn’t like the cycle of rinse and repeat we seem to be starting.

I noticed Robert Greene's [48 Laws of Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_48_Laws_of_Power) on the shelf behind The Quartering after he dropped his highly sought after Covfefe brand coffee founder's vault pack (seen in below screenshot), including a rare signed thick piece of paper.

It's kinda like many other creators or writers churning out sigs for extra change. It's funny but I low key hope he's successful.

I wonder if he used a signing machine.  
  
This reminded me that I have a signed copy of this same book by Greene. And I bet it's a signed copy if The Quartering ganna put it on his reddit shelf in videos. I got mine at B&N as part of a [box set](https://www.raptisrarebooks.com/product/the-48-laws-of-power-mastery-robert-greene-signed-box-set/), including another (unsigned) book. I remember when purchasing it that it was surprisingly cheep for a popular book (sold over 1.2 million copies). I paid $50 for it back in 2020, so I've assumed there must be a lot of signed copies out there -probably thousands, but didn't find exact figures. But I did find [Greene sweatin out a myriad of signatures for a newer book](https://www.tiktok.com/@robertgreene/video/7027261978565545221). Based on the content of the book and cult following it has, I feel like it mighta inspired the Quartering to make the founders pack.

I don't know about the value of signed books (or signed cardstock from an anti-SJW rumble creator..). But I'm curious, how much could something like this be worth beyond the sentimentality of niche conservatives or star wars originalists?

I see ppl tryna sell this same signed box set (or just the signed book) for up to $1000. No shot it's worth that. My guess is something like an extra 5 or 10 bucks beyond a random used copy.

How much is this founder pack thing worth? Or how much would someone have to pay you to take a Quartering signature off their hands?

What to expect ?,"I was placed on investigatory suspension because, during training, I experienced a brief period of drowsiness. My eyelids felt heavy, but it only lasted a few minutes. Throughout, I remained sitting upright and was facing the instructor—I never had my head down or slumped over.

Later, the training manager called me in and asked why I was sleeping. I explained that I wasn’t asleep, just drowsy, likely due to exhaustion from caring for my dog, who required constant attention. Sadly, my dog passed away that same day.

The following morning—just hours after my dog’s death—I was officially placed on investigatory suspension for “sleeping,” which I found offensive and inaccurate. I wasn’t asleep, just momentarily tired, and I corrected it quickly with some coffee.

I provided a statement explaining that “sleeping” was not an accurate description, and that my drowsiness was the result of days spent providing intensive care for my dog—feeding, giving water, monitoring vitals, etc. The managers who suspended me seemed surprised to learn about my dog’s death, as the manager who initially filed the report had not communicated this context. They offered condolences and were sympathetic, but still followed standard procedure and escorted me out.

That meeting happened Wednesday morning. Today (Friday), I received a call asking me to come in Monday at 7 a.m.

I had been single for a couple of years, but in 2020 I met ""John"" at work. We hit it off right away and started dating. We had in depth conversations about our pasts and our future goals. He was a couple years younger than me, and had never married or had children, and I wanted to make it clear before things got serious that I had no intention of doing either of those things again, but that I also wasn't DTF (and no judgment on those who are). He said he was good with all those things. John is soft spoken, introverted, and a little clueless when it comes to technology. He said his parents didn't allow that sort of thing in the house, so he missed out on the internet revolution and video games and what have you. I, however, am an avid gamer, and was excited to introduce him to all of my favorites, and we had a lot of fun together.

During that time, we met each other's friends, which included his coworkers from his second job. We went out on double dates and outings together. I also introduced him to my family, had him over for holidays, etc,. But some holidays he traveled to see his parents, who lived in another state. On these occasions I would send him with a dessert, as well as a card and/or gifts, and he would bring back a card from them, and possibly a small gift, for me. But when I tried to make plans to meet them, he deflected, saying his mother's arthritis was getting bad and she couldn't travel. When I offered to travel with him, he said they wouldn't be comfortable with us sharing a room at their house, since they were very religious. I offered to split a hotel room, and he said the town they lived in was pretty remote and there weren't accommodations nearby.

John and I are different races, so I started to suspect that they might not be okay with our relationship. When I asked, he said that even if they did have a problem with it, he clearly didn't, and it was our opinions that mattered. I decided after that to let it go. But then we started to get serious about moving in together in the spring of 2024, and I broached the subject of meeting them again, since we were about to take the next step in our relationship. He agreed, and we made plans to spend a week in his hometown in September of that year.

Meanwhile, I had gotten a better job, and we started house hunting. I liked that John had modest tastes, and he wasn't interested in buying as much house as we could afford paycheck to paycheck. Another thing I liked about him was that he was very responsible with his money and had worked hard to keep his credit rating high. We saw quite a few houses before we were both satisfied. I wanted to keep my kids in their same highly rated school district, which of course means the properties in the area are expensive, but we were getting ready to put in an offer on a really cute ranch in the summer of 2024.

The night before we were supposed to go to the bank and submit our loan application, we were going to have dinner, but first, I was going back over all our documents to make sure we had everything they'd asked for, and took a quick glance at the copy of his driver's license. I was about to move on, but I noticed he had the newer style layout for his ID (the state had recently changed it) but I didn't, so I took a look, and that's when everything changed.

Remember how I said he was younger than me by two years? That should've put his birthday in 1988. His ID had it as 1971. At first I was confused. How could they have made such an egregious mistake? Everyone we knew thought he was in his 30's, not just on looks alone, but also the fact that, like I said, he worked two jobs, and had no chronic health conditions.

I looked at the ID for a long time, continuing to come up with justifications. He didn't drink or smoke, so it was perfectly feasible that he'd gotten his new ID, put it in his wallet, and didn't even look at it again until he made the copy I had in my hand. And who pours over their own ID looking for mistakes, anyway? No one. That's who. But I couldn't just put the copy back in the envelope. The DMV's mistake could come back to bite us in the ass later. These were legal documents we were about to sign. Everything needed to be correct.

We were getting together that night anyway, so I decided to just head over to his place at the normal time (it was too late to do anything about it that day). We had dinner, and I explained the error I had found, and figured we could stop at the DMV and find out how much of a headache this was going to be first thing in the morning. It might not be that big of a deal, and we might still be able to make our appointment with the bank. He was silent as I pulled the copy out of the envelope, and when I offered it to him, he accepted it, but his face was unreadable.

""You must be pissed they made such a stupid mistake,"" I said, trying to draw something out of him, but he stayed quiet for a long time.

Finally, he set the copy on the table and put his face in his hands. My stomach dropped.

""It's not a mistake,"" he said.

What followed was a tale straight out of a telenovela: John had lied about his age to everyone. He wore multifocal contacts, kept up with modern fashion trends, and was clean shaven, head and beard, so no one would know he was graying. He didn't have any social media accounts because his two worlds may have collided. He had been, in fact, been married, and divorced, and had a daughter who was IN HER EARLY 30'S, and he was, in fact, a GRANDFATHER of two. His parents were both DEAD, and he spent the holidays he wasn't with me and my family with his daughter.

I took all of this in in silence, then quietly grabbed the envelope, pulled all of my documents out of it, grabbed my purse and keys, and calmly said, ""I never want to see or speak to you again. Stay away from me and my family."" He begged me to stay, he said we could work it out, do counseling, whatever, he said I was breaking his heart, and he was even getting ready to cry, but I kept it together long enough to get out the door.

I made it a few miles down the road before I had to pull the car over to cry. I'm sure I don't have to describe how betrayed and disgusted I felt. I'd thought I'd screened for all the red flags, but it would've taken a private investigator to find them. Is this what modern dating has come to? Spending thousands of dollars just to prove to yourself that it's safe to get attached to someone? He called: I blocked his number. Who dates someone the same age as their adult child, anyway? If he could lie this deep, and for so long, what else was he capable of lying about? And what was the end game? Did he expect to be able to keep up this charade forever? Or just long enough that I would be tied to him through a mortgage? And what about the trip we were supposed to take in September? What excuse would he have used to call it off? And how stupid would I have to have been to buy it?

That thought got me pissed off enough to dry my tears. I refuse to be disrespected to even a tenth of that degree. and I concluded that he could go fuck himself.

I pulled myself together and drove home. When I got there, I explained to the kids that John wasn't ready to take the next step, and we'd broken up. They were sad about it, but understanding. We all had our feelings, and since then, we've begun to move on.

Fast forward to a week ago, nearly a year later. A friend of John's (we'll call him Scott) reached out to me through text, asking what had happened between us. I was confused, since it had been so long ago and most of the people who knew us had already reached out, but I sent my standard ""i don't want to stir up shit, ask him"" response. He replied with, ""I think I already know, but I want to hear it from you."" I said, ""What is it you think you know?"" He texted back, ""I think he was cheating on you."" Me, ""What makes you say that?"" Him: ""I saw him with another woman once, out at a restaurant, while you were together. I told myself it wasn't him, but after you broke up, I thought maybe you caught him.""

I was torn. His cheating on me would've added more salt to the wound. Why would I want to hear about it now, after I'd started to move on? On the other hand, what if the other woman was, in fact, his daughter? I had wanted to tell everyone the truth from the get-go, but I also thought that if I had it would've torn the entire friend group apart. As it was, I was still close with some of the people I'd met through him, and we'd both maintained the stance that things just hadn't worked out. There's a saying that goes, ""It's easier to fool a man than it is to convince him he's been fooled."" I knew some would accuse me of making things up to make him look like the bad guy, but with Scott to back me up, maybe it would be different. Then again, I didn't want to drag his daughter, an innocent bystander, into the line of fire. I'd been able to find her Facebook page after some serious research (John had dropped her name at some point in his explanation of the truth), and there was a picture of John holding one of his grandchildren on her page. If I could find her, so could someone else. But I also thought she had a right to know he was living a double life. What if he had been doing this for years? What if he had multiple families, and she had half siblings she'd never met? What was the right thing to do?

I left Scott on read for a couple of days, wrestling with the whole thing. Finally, I texted him back, asking if he and his wife (we'll call her Jeanine) had some time for coffee. We arranged a day, and met up.

I asked Scott why he had reached out after so long. He explained that he felt guilty about not saying anything before, and that it was Jeanine who had encouraged him to offer me the chance to know the truth. I told them I was going back and forth about something, too. Jeanine asked if the woman John had been with that day thought she was the girlfriend, just like I did? Because if so, she deserved to know.

I decided to show them John's daughters' Facebook page. Scott immediately said, ""That's her! That's who I saw him with!""

That confirmation was enough to make up my mind: I told them everything, and when I was done, they were fuming, and ranted about what a bastard he was, and when they were done, I asked them what they thought I should do. Should I contact his daughter? Or was she better off not knowing?

We debated it through a second cup of coffee, and in the end, Jeanine said that if I didn't want to do it, with the whole bitter ex thing looming over the proceedings, that she would. I didn't want to be a coward, so I asked her to give John's daughter my contact details, so that if she wanted to talk, we could.

John's daughter reached out to me yesterday, asking if it would be okay if she called. I was at work, but I gave her a time, and we talked. She asked if he'd been with me and my kids for Christmas of '22, and I said he had. She asked what I'd sent him ""to his parents'"" with the Thanksgiving before. I said it was pumpkin bread, and that she would know if it was from me because I bake mine in a bundt pan. She complimented me on my baking (which was surreal as hell) and said the kids had really liked the orange cake from Easter the year before. I asked where he said they came from, and she said John said a woman at work made a bunch for everyone in the department. I asked where he'd said he'd been, and she said he'd claimed not to be up to making the drive as often as he used to. ""He's in his 50's, after all,"" and we both had a bitter laugh over that. She then asked how long we'd been together, and I said it had been four years. She asked for my birthday, and I told her. She cried for a few minutes, and I told her how sorry I was, and that it wasn't my intention to ruin her life, but the rest of us thought she deserved to know the truth.

She calmed down, thanked me for my time, and said goodbye. I reached out to Jeanine to let her know John's daughter had called, and we speculated about what she would do with the information she now had.  I asked Jeanine what she and Scott were going to do, and she said they hadn't decided, but they knew they couldn't be friends with him any more. She asked if I would stay in touch, and I said I would before we said our goodbyes, and I went to bed.

I woke up this morning to a shit storm of missed calls, voicemails, dm's, and a long string of text messages from a number I didn't recognize. It was John with a new number, and he's pissed. Obviously. Apparently, his daughter is far more adept at moving in the shadows than I am, because she undertook a whistleblower campaign of massive proportions. I don't know how she managed to contact so many people, but once she'd dumped the entire sordid tale on enough of them, the story grew legs and ran on its own. John called me a vindictive bitch, told me I'd ruined his life, that all of his friends had turned their backs on him, he couldn't show his face at either of his jobs ever again, and he would never see his grandchildren again, all because of me.

That last really struck a nerve with me. It's heartbreaking to think about those kids losing their relationship with a grandparent. They're the most innocent parties in this whole thing. I know he said it just to hurt me, and that he did this to himself, but at the same time, there's a part of me that feels like I should've kept my mouth shut. The missed calls, dm's, etc, they were obviously John's mostly former friends, and even some family members, either demanding that I shut the hell up and stop spreading rumors, demanding to hear the story from me, backing me up with stories of little slips of his over the years, promises that they're never going to speak to him again, one even said something about how he guessed ""everything must've been up to par in the sack, or you would've suspected,"" to which I replied ""Kindly find a corner to fuck off in, and if you could lose my number on the way, that would be great,"" and the list goes on. There's a lot of genuine hurt mixed in there, and I can't help but think that it's at least partly my fault.

There is so much to unpack with this. From people being rude and disrespectful, disheveling and trashing the store, leaving things on the floor, and don’t get me started on the constant “do you work here” or “wheres the fitting room” when we have giant signs, uniforms we wear that make it obvious whether we work here or where the men’s department is. 

Obviously when someone is disgruntled it’s infuriating but cleaning up after literal grown adults is taking the piss out of me in so many ways. In my opinion it is really not that difficult to put things back where you got it from yet people just place their unwanted items or whatever in random places and we have to clean this up everyday. We also have to clean up peoples trash like coffee cups left in random places in the store too. 

OR when people try on a crap ton of items at a time in the fitting room, and having to retrieve their items all disheveled, they hand clothes to you not on the hangers, scrunched up and inside out. It’s seriously infuriating how apparently difficult it is to put clothes properly on a hanger.

And then you get the people who will say that this is part of the job, like okay??? That doesn’t mean you make it more difficult for us!!! People are so inconsiderate nowadays. I don’t want to be bitter because of this, because I like being a kind person.

1jmdkag,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jmdkag/update_my_35m_wife_34f_of_11_years_has_fallen_out/,[UPDATE] My (35m) wife (34f) of 11 years has fallen out of love with me,"Huge post, TLDR: Skip to the bottom two paragraphs.

So my last post found [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jlbppf/my_35m_wife_34f_of_11_years_has_fallen_out_of/) was quickly typed out after a fight with my wife and obviously I didn't read it or think about it before posting, I was running out the house to work. I was just wrought with despair to post something. My account is over twelve years old but I've hardly posted anything. I figure this time I should delve a little deeper into the entire 11 year marriage because my last post made it seem like I straight up ignored every holiday and like sat in a chair or something and I was rightfully lambasted by any sane person who read the drivel I put out. Turns out you need more information for something that long so here we go.

We first met at a restaurant we both worked at. She fell for me pretty quickly and I was oblivious. We hung out a few times with others after work and developed a friendship. She was dating someone else at the time, and called me frantically that he was drunk and almost drove them into a canal and wanting me to pick her up. So I ended up taking her home. For a while we sparked but she was still seeing this other man so we were cheating. This comes into play later.

She says I ""saved her from an abusive relationship"". I felt guilty that they were still together but a couple of weeks and they were finally over. We fall in love and move in together. During these early years we went on plenty of dates, we loved each other. We spent a lot of time together, weekly movie dates, we would go to rock concerts. We bought each other little gifts, dvds and candy, things like that. Our birthdays are five days apart and we've almost always celebrated together in the middle on the weekend or something. If it wasn't apparent from my other post, I'm not a good romantic. I would ask her what she wanted to do and plan accordingly. I've always asked for too much input looking back at it. What she wanted but never expressed in the early years was that she wanted me to take charge, plan something without her input at all. I do take responsibility for that, I could have been more romantic. I proposed at Christmas with her family. The first Mother's day together we had a great night out and dinner and we went half on the bill. Something she recently told me as a painful memory. We never joined bank accounts because she had a belief about financial independence but in my mind it was all household money, as long as the bills were paid and we got to do our fun stuff I wasn't concerned with money and this is another point of contention. She had bought a car and had some of her own bills but any time she would be stressed about money I would help. But to her I never asked, I didn't know there was a problem until she brought it up. We failed to communicate. I thought my wife would bring my attention to shortcomings either with each other or financially or otherwise. She's always wanted me to be a mindreader.

A few years pass and she wants to have a kid. I'd been against having children my whole life and told her so many times that that is not what I wanted. But I loved her, and I saw a future with her so I decided to go for it. We have a beautiful baby boy. Everyone knows the first few years after a child is born are very hard, and it's hard work to find time for each other. I think we failed to do that. I took a lot of late nights thinking that would help her get sleep. But I ended up sleeping in the daytime and we didn't spend time together. He was diagnosed with Autism after the daycare he was at saw signs. I wasn't there for the doctor's visit. I was working. I didn't know how important it was, I failed them both here. After his diagnosis he had speech and occupational therapy on mondays and fridays, days I worked so she took him to his appointments. She would bring up that she was the one putting in the work for him and I would offer to switch days, to take it over. She would refuse, but still be upset and feel like it was all on her. Another failed communication. We are still loving and treating each other well at this point.

As time went on we faced more challenges. My wife's job wanted to make her a travelling trainer but we couldn't afford to do it because I would have to stop working while she was gone in order to care for our son. We have had very little support from family and difficulty finding babysitters so we've been doing almost everything alone. She feels like she has to take the back burner again and sacrifice her career opportunities for us. Dates become scarce without help caring for our son and she starts to drift away from me.

When I said the past 3-4 years were rocky, here is the start, at least in my mind. There was a hurricane. A big one. We had made a plan to barricade in our house. The night before she called me from work saying they were extending hours, a nearby hotel was bringing people in and other excuses. I believed her but as the night went on I became worried. I started to drive to her work and called her telling her I was coming to get her for her safety. She told me they had closed the bridge and she couldn't get home, that she was at a friends house and was safe. She convinced me to stay home and bunker down. The next morning I was alone with our son and checking the weather reports. Flood zones expanded from A to A through E. We were in B, on the edge of A. Suddenly we found ourselves in danger. I called her to tell her I needed to drive through the storm and find shelter, she tried to tell me to stay where I was. It wasn't an option, 20 feet of flooding would be above the house. I manage to get to a school through the storm while on the phone with her crying, scared. When we get in line police are taking weapons from people and kicking them out, guns and knives. We get to the hallway in a 3x3 patch of ground with tape marking it off, dogs nearby barking at each other and my son is very afraid of dogs. We luckily get pulled into a room, 25 people or so in a classroom where we stay for the night and entire next day. I don't sleep at all, afraid for my son's safety from certain people we were with, that all our possessions are in a duffle bag anyone could grab and go with, scared out of my mind for my wife. Finally we can leave the shelter.

We get home with no power and no means to reach each other, cell towers aren't working. Fearing for her I still can't sleep, I manage a couple hours here and there laying in bed with my son. She finally comes home three days later. She confesses she wasn't at a friends. She was with a guy. I was obviously distraught but she insisted she wasn't going to stay in our house with no power, that he had a generator. So the three of us go to his house. I stay at the house of the person my wife has an affair with. He's ex-military and a gun nut, literally shotguns and rifles laying around everywhere. She tells me she feels safe with him, that he posted up outside with a gun during the hurricane so no looters would get to the or their stuff. In a hurricane? I'm laying in the yard filled with every negative emotion. How could my wife do this, why am I here? Is my son safe? At night the three of us end up drinking a lot. My wife goes to sleep with my son in his bed. He's telling me about his tinder hookups and for some reason I'm upset on behalf of my wife. He's bedding my beautiful, amazing wife and telling me about other women? He tells me how he watched for looters during the hurricane. That he would never shoot a person. But sometimes people turn into zombies. And he *pow* would love to blast a zombie. I feel unsafe. I go to my wife in the bed and we are talking. He comes in and sees the three of us in his bed, gets drunkenly angry and thinks we are taking advantage of him, that he's been honey potted. Yells at us and kicks us out onto the couch. I don't sleep that night either.

The day after we go home. I end up spilling my heart to her that night and we have a huge coming together moment. Our relationship has never been closer. But old habits slip in, we stop paying attention to each other, stop going on as many dates. The birthdays and mothers days she wants now are trips alone, time away from us. She gets mad at whatever plan I make because she wanted a hotel and freedom from us. If I'm remembering correctly we fight about plans and she spends her birthday alone at an amusement park and when she gets home I didn't have dinner or a surprise or anything. I didn't expect her home when she was, she said she would be home later. I was wrong not to do anything, I messed up.

Now I've left out a lot of details about our love life and the effort my original post talks about. At this point I don't plan dates anymore. We might go to movies here and there, or just end up at the local waterpark or something but it's always ""Hey what do you want to do today"" and never planned. Our sex life is not entirely gone but there is something lacking. I will tell you that yes, my post was entirely right and I have basically never done any 'grand gestures'. No flower petals to the bed, no candlelit picnics in the yard, no 'Honey get dressed and get in the car, I've already got the night planned out'. I have made small efforts. Love notes, I know how she likes her coffee from starbucks, flirty texts. I show her tons of physical attention because as I learned too late that was my love language and how I expressed it. Her love language is acts of service and I didn't do things she wanted in that department. She would hint that the car needs to be detailed or someone she works with got a gift basket. I never bought flowers just because. I did some things right though, I've written her poetry that brought her to tears. There are a thousand pictures in our house of family halloweens, date nights, trips and happiness. Beautiful photos of us happy at our wedding. But it was a court house wedding with three people in attendance. We took one day together as our honeymoon and never took a later trip. At this point I've taken on the entirety of rent, utilities, health and car insurance, and several other bills. I pay for our season passes to zoos, waterparks and amusement parks. I'm not well off enough to have expensive dates.

Her birthday comes, the one in the original post. She overdrinks, get sick and we do nothing. The next day I didn't do anything.  The next weekend I do nothing. I am well aware of how I messed up guys. She would have been happy with a balloon and a cupcake with a candle. I did not pour love into her cup at all.

Now we've come to the present. At the beginning of this month I find a text between her and another man. Its not the first time since her infidelity, which I chose to forgive her for. I've seen messages a girl sent me between her boyfriend and my wife. We were drunk one night and she wanted to send naughty pictures to my manager she has a crush on, and she did. I was complicit. We've talked about group sex, threesomes and whatnot. So this time when I found the messages she demanded an open relationship in order to explore her sexuality and fun with this man while remaining in a relationship with me. So I agreed. I didn't just agree, I was understanding. I bought books on polyamory. We sat down and agreed on boundaries. The guy came to my house and we spoke face to face. I was doing this to make her happy and meet her needs. Guys if this isn't a grand gesture then I don't know what is. 

But it has been going predictably. He's older with no wife and kids, he has money. He can offer her a life I am unable to. She's developed feelings for him. We fight, we try to fix things. I've already been in the process of doing better, changing my mindset and taking care of my body. I've been reading the Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work to learn how to communicate better. I'm putting in effort. I plan a picnic date at a park where we had one of our first dates. She refuses to go, this is the effort she wanted years ago but its too late. I feel like she is stuck in the past but I acknowledge the damage done and see from her perspective. But I can't keep hearing the same argument over and over, I want to move forward. She has negative views of past events, even ones that were positive. Over the last two weeks she tells me she's done about five times. She waffles over and over, I will get a text saying she doesn't want to give up on us but then when she gets home there is nothing I can say or do to save our marriage. Some of these fights feel manufactured in order to go to the other man. She says he is my biggest supporter, that he wants it to work out between us and he helps her understand my perspective and gives advice.

But it has become frequent. Yesterday she told me she wants a divorce and unfortunately I took that as no coming back. She seemed pretty adamant. And overwhelmed in my despair, feeling absolutely hopeless I went into the garage I tried to hang myself. I survived. I went to work, she didn't know. I had broken one of the dining table chairs and spilt a gas can in my struggle. We text through the night and I tell her I did something irredeemable and we'll talk when I get home. I show her my neck and we talked.

She tells me today that up until yesterday she thought we could fix this. I ask what made her tell me she was done so many times. She says she lashed out in anger and said things she didn't mean. But now there is no fixing this. She is staying at his house right now to figure things out but I know she is done. I tried to tell her she can't stay with me now anyway. Here we get to the advice I need, we have to co-parent our child. I wish with all my heart we could become whole again but I can't see how that could happen. How do I go about repairing the trauma I've inflicted and leading a life intertwined for him?",7,1743219264.0,relationship_advice,1,0.77,False

I (late 20s F) have a rescue mutt who has to have some amount of sighthound in here. She is definitely a mix of at least 2 hunting/ working dogs. 

We were working on off leash e collar (vibrate/tone) recalls, and it was going great! Since she has such strong prey drive, she has a tendency to not recall, so we have been working on it in our backyard. Today was awesome, she stayed at my side the entire time I was in the backyard trimming trees, pulling the dead plants out of the garden, it was great. 

I had to get something to drink for myself and the dog, so I hooked her up to her typical lead, the kind that screws into the ground. It spans the entire backyard, but had rusted slightly from the winter. My theory is that the hinge got stuck on some rust and didn’t close all of the way. I should have checked, or just took her in with me. We were already out there multiple hours, and I’m kicking myself so hard for not bringing her in, because I second guessed it and decided not to. 

I came back out with the water, and the second I stepped out of the screen porch, I looked at her, she looked at me, I looked down to see the lead in the grass, looked back up at her, and she just took off. She’s so fast, so wiry and lean. Built for running. I started trying to recall her, but looked up and saw she was running for another dog. She’s friendly, but I know some dogs aren’t and I didn’t want to get another dog in trouble because of my stupidity. 

Salem (my dog) is very good at dodging people. I’m not blaming the woman in the slightest, but what happened is that the lady (69 y/o)  noticed Salem, and moved to attempt to get out of my dogs path. The direction she chose to step was where Salem was trying to go around her. So Salem clipped the woman’s legs from behind and my only thoughts were that “oh my god I just broke someone’s hip”. I know first hand how you just don’t get a good quality of life back breaking a hip at that age. I thought I ruined someone’s life. 

I sprinted up and immediately tried to help her. Her only words were that she thinks she just broke her leg. I asked if she wanted me to call 911 for an ambulance, someone else, or both. She just kept saying ‘ow’ over and over again. I just called 911, our neighbors started coming out to help after I started speaking with dispatch. I started sobbing on the phone with them. Not like making a scene or anything, but I had to choke some words out. 

By the time the ambulance and fire chief pulled up, she was in less pain, and was having happy little conversations with everyone. She was being so kind to me, which made me cry harder. For fucks sake, my dog just hurt her and she was on the stretcher pulling me in for a hug to comfort ME. I was besides myself. I had to tell multiple people that I wasn’t concerned about my dog at all. They thought I was crying because she was going to get taken from me. A) I knew she wasn’t, and B) I did not give one fuck about my dog in that moment, I was so worried about an older woman who I potentially crippled. 

She gave me her number from the stretcher, told me to have coffee with her some time, and that this is just piss in the wind. I texted her and told her I will pay her deductible and any out of pocket. She’s on Medicare so it won’t be a huge hit. My husband says that was stupid to do without speaking to a lawyer, but I don’t care. It’s the least I could do.

We texted a bit throughout the day and night, she’s super nice and funny and I think we could be friends. I got her flowers, some good chocolates, a card, and got her dog a toy and some treats. I also got her a Kohls gift card to replace the leggings that had to be cut by EMT. I dropped them off on her porch before she got home. I asked if she needed a ride home, I offered home improvement services (I’m in the trades) if she ever needed anything around the house. I’m planning on helping her and her husband (70) with yard work this year. 

She texted me that her fibula has a small fracture, and that a small bone in her ankle has a hairline fracture. She doesn’t need a cast, just a boot and some crutches. She keeps telling me that everything is alright and things will work out just the way god intends them to. She keeps telling me not to worry about anything. I feel so guilty for having hurt somebody, and I feel super ashamed and embarrassed that I did that and my entire neighborhood witnessed it. Which makes me feel more guilty because it feels selfish to be embarrassed. It’s my fault and my fault alone. Not my dogs, not hers. I just can’t believe this happened. I cried for a good couple hours today. I feel awful about it, especially because she seems to be a wonderful and kind and accepting woman, to be able to forgive me so quickly with all of my face tattoos on display and every facial piercing you could think of. 

Rant over lol,

TLDR: My dog clotheslined a 69 year old woman’s leg, and broke it. Shes so kind and I’m feeling incredibly guilty. ",1,1743219208.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I work as a controller at a 60FTE company, posting here for your insights. 

Recently, there has been some crazy turnover in our finance department. Our head of FP&A quit over some huge argument with the CEO. He was a dick though, he cut out all the good coffee and I think at one point he got rid of snacks in the break room. Needless to say, when he was not promoted he stormed out of the office (AND took our K-pods on the way)

I work very closely with finance on our accruals and actuals, they have a financial analyst who is brand new to the job but keeps saying he is acting head of FP&A. Yesterday, I had to explain what an XLOOKUP was after I found him hardcoding information in the old models!

There have been murmurs in the office that he wants to be CFO and I am not sure how to feel about that. He calls me and everyone else “bruh” and says his new job title gets him “hella huzz” (???) His instagram is pretty clean tho. 

I’m also afraid that to prove his value he’s going to get rid of the water and custodial services in the office. He already doesn’t flush the men’s room (he said he needed to deliver value by streamlining our expenses and saving on water is a big one). 

Do you think I should talk with the CEO? Or is it time for me to jump ship? I have also been eyeing the CFO position but I’m still figuring out what a variance to actuals is. ",0,1743218954.0,FPandA,4,0.31,False

I’m using la marzocco 14g basket with 14g medium roasted coffee, but feel like 1/4 basket is empty after tamping. I tried with 18g coffee and same grinder setting, the flow is slower (30 sec, ~35g coffee) but still having the water leaking.

I was using lagom casa with grinder setting at 7 if it helps 

Is it a level issue when I tamping? Or is it something else?

I am leaving Gainesville over the summer and am looking for someone to sublease my apartment at Lexington Crossing \~ 3700 SW 27th Street! The apartment is student-only housing and requires proof of enrollment for residency.

Rent is $629, plus utilities, ranging from $50 to $70.

You could move in as early as Monday, April 28th, 2025, and the lease ends on Thursday, July 31st, 2025.

The apartment is a 3x3 on the third floor, and the sublease is for Unit A. The unit will come furnished with a bed frame and mattress, a dresser, a side table, and a desk. The bathroom has storage under the sink and a medicine cabinet.  Each unit has a deadbolt lock. You would have your own private bedroom, bathroom, and closet space. The apartment has a laundry room with a washer and a dryer, and the washer was recently replaced. The kitchen has a working fridge, microwave, stove, oven, and dishwasher. The living area has two couches, a coffee table, a side table, a TV, and a dining table. The apartment also has an attached patio.

I have two female roommates, however, they generally keep to themselves.

The apartment is near the leasing office and amenities, including a fitness room, a game room, a study room, a pool, a basketball court, and a tennis court. The parking is a surface lot, and parking passes are not required, so residents and guests can park freely. There are plenty of parking spots near the apartment.

I (37M) do not want my biological son (15) to live in my house.

The drama started last night just after dinner. I had a movie on and was grabbing a handful of popcorn when the doorbell rang. It was after dark, so I checked the ring camera. There was a middle-aged guy and a teenaged kid. The man looked angry, gripping the kid by the arm. The kid looked frightened.

I went to the door and opened it. “Can I help…”

Before I could finish, the guy said “You can keep your f(slur) son!” and shoved the kid towards me.

He turned and walked away. The kid looked at him. “Dad…” he said. His voice was cracking.

Over his shoulder, the guy snarled “You’re not my son!” He kept walking towards a car running in the driveway. I stood there, stunned, as he got into the car, reversed out of the driveway and drove off. I thought I saw a woman in the passenger seat as the guy got in.

I looked at the kid incredulously. “Who are you? What is this all about?”

The kid looked about to burst into tears. “My name is Jedidiah Wilson. You are my father. And I am gay.”

My eyebrows shot up. It was possible.

I suppose a little back story is in order. I am the youngest of three brothers. There’s Tom and John (twins 39) and me. During college, I was a sperm donor to earn a little extra money. My parents were moderately well-off and funded college for all three of us. But they also believed we should ‘learn to stand on our own two feet’, which meant getting summer jobs and making do on a limited budget. “We love you and want to help, but we won’t spoil you” was something they both said.

I was healthy, had good grades and athletic. (College swim team, but I never won any championships.) So I was accepted as a donor. According to the clinic, I have twenty-seven biological children.

In my last year of college, I got an idea for a start-up. I spoke to my brothers about it and they both liked the idea.

Tom had a law degree and is a genius organizer.

John is a born salesman – during high school, he worked part-time as a lot boy at the local car dealership. Even though he wasn’t one of their salesmen, he sold five cars while he worked there. The owner was tickled pink and insisted John receive the commissions over the objections of the sales manager.

We pitched it to our parents and dad fronted us with the cash. Between me doing the tech, Tom managing and John selling, the business took off. Dad offered advice when we needed it. Seven years later, we got bought out. After tax, we had $33 million, split four ways.

Tom bought his way into a local law practice, John set up as a financial consultant (he manages my investments to this day) and I turned to my favorite hobby - horses. I bought forty acres just outside the city, built a house, barn and riding ring and set out to enjoy myself.

Though Tom and John both married and had kids, I did not. I’m sort of bi, but I just wasn’t particularly interested in either sex. My brothers tease me about getting married, but I just remind them I have over four times as many offspring as they do between them.

Which brings me back to Jedidiah – or Jed, as he calls himself.

After a moment staring at him and him staring at me, pleading, I said “Let’s go inside. Have you eaten?”

He shook his head ‘no,’ so I took him to the kitchen. I gave him some left over chicken and pan-fried a few potatoes, poured him a glass of orange juice and told him to dig in.

He started eating and I phoned Tom, figuring as a lawyer, he could give me advice. I quickly explained the situation.

“Jesus effing Christ, Mike,” Tom said, “that’s child abandonment! Did you call the cops?” When I told him no, he said he was coming over right away, but to call the cops immediately.

I called 911 after Tom hung up and told them everything. The operator said they would send an officer as soon as possible.

No sooner had I disconnected from 911 than my phone rang. It was Tom again. “Mike, I’ve called another lawyer who specializes in this sort of problem. Linda Tennant’s a gay rights advocate and she’s on her way over. Is that okay?”

Tom probably knew what kind of help I needed, so I agreed.

While I waited for Tom, the cops, and the other lawyer, I spoke to Jed. Jed wolfed down the chicken, pan fries, juice and a large bowl of chocolate ice cream as he told me his situation.

He’d known for years his ‘dad’ wasn’t his biological father because he overheard his parents talking about a second artificial insemination for another child. His ‘dad’ was infertile while his mother could conceive normally. They were both extreme fundamentalists and wanted a ‘quiverfull’ of children, but they couldn’t afford a second treatment. They were rejected for adoption – Jed didn’t know the reason. Jed’s ‘dad’ – David Wilson – believed in ‘spare the rod and spoil the child’ so he frequently beat Jed for even minor ‘transgressions.’ (David’s word)

Jed started to be aware of his gay feelings a couple of years ago; he hid his feelings from his parents, knowing how they felt about ‘f(slur)s’. He was afraid of his ‘dad’ and started to hate him. He wanted to find his ‘real’ father. Jed sent a sample to one of those ‘ancestry’ companies and got a seven half-siblings and one ‘probable’ uncle – my brother John.

Before Jed could contact my brother, Caroline, another of my bio-children, reached out to Jed. Caroline found me through John about a year ago. I’d had a nice conversation with Caroline and her parents, who now lived in California. Caroline told Jed about me.

Jed was trying to work up the courage to call me when he got outed. He told a friend about his feelings. The friend told his parents, who went to the same church as Jed’s parents. The friend’s parents told David Wilson about his ‘unclean’ son.

David forced a confession out of Jed. He spent a week trying to get Jed to ‘repent’, which Jed refused to do. David searched Jed’s computer and found the messages from Caroline. At that point, David decided to throw Jed out. He loaded Jed in the car and drove three hours to my house, where he abandoned Jed.

“So, I’ve got no place to go” Jed finished.

“I wish I could help you, Jed, but…” I stopped as Jed’s face fell. Changing course quickly, I told him he could spend the night while we figured things out.

“I – I understand” Jed said. His voice was cracking again.

The doorbell rang and Tom walked in with my parents right behind him. “Mom and dad were over for dinner” Tom explained. “They insisted on coming.”

I didn’t really mind. Mom and dad have always rallied around every time there was a problem.

Mom stopped in the kitchen door. “Good heavens!” she said. “He looks exactly like you at that age.”

“Yeah,” dad agreed “are you sure he isn’t a clone?” My dad’s typical humor. I rolled my eyes and Jed cringed. Seeing Jed’s reaction, dad apologized “Sorry, lad.”

Everyone sat down around the kitchen table. Just as I started to fill them in, a cop car pulled into the driveway, blues and reds flashing. I went to the door and invited them in just as another one pulled in as well.

There wasn’t enough room for everyone in the kitchen, so we moved to the living room. Before we could sit down again, another car pulled in. “That’ll be Linda” Tom said.

We waited for a few minutes for Linda to come in. She had to explain to the cops in the second car before they let her through.

Finally, we all sat down. We started with Jed, letting him tell the cops and Linda his story. They asked a few questions, getting David Wilson’s full name and address. I told my story and showed them the footage from the ring camera, including the time stamp.

Questions done, the cops stood up. “Well, I suppose we better get him to the homeless shelter…” the senior cop began. Jed hunched his back.

“Out of the question!” Linda Tennant objected loudly. “The child’s been thrown out, abandoned. Do you want to do that to him twice in one night?” My parents nodded vigorously in agreement.

“I promised Jed he could stay the night” I said.

The cops looked at each other. The senior cop looked at Tom. “Tom, we’ve met at court. Do you trust your brother?”

Tom snorted. “Do I trust my own blood? Of course I do!”

The senior cop sighed. “Okay. The lad can stay here for now.”

I walked with them to the door and shook their hands. They got in their car and drove off.

“I’d like to talk to Jed for a while” Linda said. “Privately.” Her eyes swept over the rest of us. She saw my eyebrows go up. “This is a privileged conversation.”

Tom nodded. “And I better have a similar talk with my brother.”

“It’s early, but I can go give the horses their night hay. Tom can talk to me in the barn.”

Mom stood up. “Jed, do you have any other clothes?”

“Just what I’m wearing.”

Mom glanced at her watch. “There’s just enough time to get to Target before it closes. Tell me your sizes.” Jed tried to refuse, but mom insisted. She scribbled down a few notes, then left with dad.

Tom went out to the barn with me. I threw the horses some hay, then we sat down on bales while he warned me about some issues, including some scenarios he said were ‘very unlikely,’ including the possibility that David Wilson might accuse me of ‘enticing’ or ‘kidnapping’ Jed.

We went back to the house and peeked in the door. Linda said she and Jed were done. I noticed she had her phone on the table, recording.

Linda turned to me and said “Jed tells me he’s been beaten by his father, I want him examined by a doctor. Dr. Phillips has worked with me on a number of cases and he’s willing to see Jed on an emergency basis tomorrow morning at nine. Then I want to go to the courthouse and get a temporary custody order. Would you be willing to take Jed in for a few days?”

My mother walked in just in time to hear the last. “Of course Mike will” she said.

I swallowed my resentment. In for a penny, in for a pound, I thought. “I suppose I could” I said grudgingly. My mother frowned at me.

Linda’s eyes flicked from me to my mother to Jed and back to me. “In that case, bring him to Dr. Phillips’ office tomorrow at nine.” She tapped her phone a few times and mine pinged. “There, I’ve sent you his address.”

While I showed her to the door, my mother went over to Jed with a bag full of clothing, asking him to check the sizes. On the way out, Linda quietly told me she intended to pursue child abandonment charges against David and Clara Wilson. “I don’t expect much,” she said, “the courts here and in his home state don’t give us much cooperation on that.”

By the time I got back into the living room, my parents and Tom were wishing Jed a good night. As they went out, my mother said “I’ll see you in the morning.” I knew that tone. She had plans for me.

The door closed behind them and I looked at Jed. I picked up the remote. “Want to watch the rest of *Die Hard?*” I asked. “The popcorn’s cold, but still edible.”

When the movie was done, I showed him to a spare bedroom and where the bathroom was. As I tidied up, I heard the shower running.

\# # # #

Five thirty the next morning, I gave the horses their hay and grain. They gave me their usual ‘where the hell of you been?’ whinnies as I threw it in their mangers and buckets. Giving Banner a scratch on his crest, I grumbled to myself. I’d been looking forward to a ride that morning.

I mucked the stalls quickly before turning them out.

I went back into the house. Jed was standing in the kitchen, looking lost. “Would you mind if I had breakfast?” he asked, almost as though he expected me to say ‘no.’

I repressed a snort. “Would you like bacon and eggs? Or do you prefer cereal?”

“I’d love bacon and eggs, if it’s not too much trouble” he said.

This time I did snort. “It’s my usual breakfast. How many eggs do you want?”

“One or two would be great.” He sounded tentative.

I looked him up and down. “At your age, I usually had three. And four slices of bacon. Do you mind whole wheat toast?”

He grinned – the first time I’d seen him smile. “I love whole wheat, but dad wouldn’t have anything but white bread in the house.”

I pointed to the cupboard and fridge. “Get the bread and butter out. And the orange juice. Hand me the bacon and eggs and set the table. Make some toast and butter it while I cook.”

After Jed inhaled breakfast – three eggs – and we cleaned up, I told Jed to wander around the place. I needed to shower if we were going into town. “Just don’t bother the horses.”

Thirty minutes later, we headed into town. I found Dr. Phillips’ office and we went in. Linda Tennant was already there. So was my mother. I repressed a sigh and said hello. When Jed went in to the exam room, mom grabbed my arm. “Let’s go for coffee.” It was an order, not an invitation.

We went to a nearby Starbucks. Dad was already there. No sooner did we sit down than mom said “Mike, you’ve got to take that boy in.”

“No way, mom” I said. “I don’t want a son.”

Mom frowned. “Michael Kenneth Benson, it doesn’t matter what you want.” Mom was going full name. That meant an edict, not a request. “That boy needs a family and, whether you like it or not, you’re responsible.” Dad nodded solemnly at her words.

“He’s got a family” I said. “I was just a sperm donor.”

“Family that abandons a child is no family” she retorted. “You chose to be a donor. Choices have consequences. We raised you to accept consequences. You have a duty to Jed.” I could see dad agreeing.

I was feeling trapped. “I won’t throw him out. He can stay with me until he can be properly fostered. But I will not try to be his father.” Dad shook his head, looking disappointed.

We argued for half an hour. My parents quietly insisting, me firmly refusing.

We finished our coffees. As we got up to go back to the doctor’s office, dad said “We love you, Mike. We think you need to step up here. We’re going to be very disappointed if you don’t do this.”

Linda Tennant was waiting for us when we got back. We followed her to the courthouse a block away. By eleven AM, we had a court order appointing me Jed’s temporary guardian pending the results of a paternity test, something I didn’t like, but the judge insisted. The only shock was Linda reading out the doctor’s report: Jed had scars and bruises all over his body *except* for places where they would show. David Wilson knew exactly how to conceal the fact he was beating his son. My parents and I exchanged glances, stunned that anyone would do that to a child. I could see tears in my mother’s eyes and dad was swallowing hard.

Tom was waiting for us when we got out of the courtroom. He handed Jed a phone. “Jed, keep this with you and hidden at all times. This is for your safety. It’s got Mike’s, Linda’s, my parent’s numbers and mine programmed. Use it any time you think you’re in even the slightest danger. I suggest you turn on the tracker, but that’s your choice.”

I raised my eyebrows and Tom looked at me. “This isn’t my specialty, but I’ve heard enough about similar cases to know the risks. It’s possible David Wilson may have second thoughts and try to Jed back forcibly. Or send him to one of those ‘gay conversion’ camps. He may also accuse you of kidnapping his son.” Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Linda nodding.

We had to go back to Dr. Phillips’ office for the sample for the paternity test. As we walked back, Linda dropped another bomb. “CPS will be coming to your place this afternoon” she said. “They’re driving in from Jed’s hometown. They’ll want to interview Jed and you.”

“What?” I said. “And why from his home town?”

Linda sighed. “We have a case of child abuse. Since Jed is from out of state, it’s less complicated if CPS from his home state takes on the case.”

I looked at Jed. “What do you think about this?”

“I do not want to go back” he said. There was a look of fear in his eyes.

I could see mom, dad, and Tom looking at me expectantly. “I can understand why” I said, noncommittally. The others frowned, but said nothing.

I gave the blood sample, we said goodbye and I went home with Jed. Mom, dad, and Tom followed. When we got there, John’s car was in the driveway. I sighed to myself. A family council was being convened.

We went inside and John was waiting with his daughter Misty. I wondered why she wasn’t in school. After introductions, John said “Misty, why don’t you show Jed your horse? You can give them their noon hay, too.”

Jed looked us over. “You want to talk without me around, don’t you?” He looked straight at me. “I only met you last night, but I trust you.” I winced inwardly. Mom had a satisfied look.

After the youngsters went out, the pressure went on. All four of them made it clear they thought I should take Jed in. “You’ve been around our kids for years” John said. “We know you’re trustworthy.”

“Just because I’m trustworthy doesn’t mean I want a family” I said.

“You’re godfather to John’s and my kids” Tom pointed out.

“That’s in case of a disaster.”

“Can you think of a worse disaster than being thrown out by your own parents?” Tom retorted. He gave me a ‘gotcha’ grin.

It went on until lunch time. We called the kids in. As we ate, Jed asked me about my horses and riding. He said he liked horses, but his parents never had money for him to get one.

“Almost as if liking horses is genetic” mom said slyly. I ignored her remark.

We were just finishing when the doorbell rang. It was Linda with a man and a woman in suits. She introduced them as CPS caseworkers from Jed’s hometown.

Mom said she’d clean up. Tom headed back to his office. Dad and John went out to the barn with Jed and Misty, who wanted to ride Razor, ‘her’ horse.

The lady caseworker and Linda took Jed into my home office for their interview.

The man interviewed me in my bedroom. He questioned my background and history for about an hour. I told him about being a sperm donor and my genetic offspring. He asked to see my phone and computer. I showed him the messages between me and Caroline and two others who had contacted me. And yes, there was \*\*\*\* on my computer. He snorted and called it ‘vanilla.’

The CPS interviews finished. They asked for a few minutes to talk alone with Linda. Jed and I went out to the barn to talk with the others. Misty was just turning Razor back out. I could see them all looking at me, but I said nothing.

We went back into the house. The woman from CPS spoke formally “We have agreed that Jedidiah David Wilson should be removed from the custody of David and Clara Wilson. Since the court here has granted you temporary custody, we have agreed Jedidiah should stay with you pending a more permanent arrangement. Do you consent?”

“I do” I said. The CPS people made their farewells and left. The others lingered a while before going as well. Mom and dad hugged me and whispered I should ‘do the right thing.’ My brothers nodded knowingly and flicked their eyes at Jed as they shook my hand. Mom hugged Jed and the men all shook his hand as well. Misty hugged both me and Jed.

The door closed and I looked at Jed. “You like horses?” I said.

He smiled a little and said yes.

“You need some riding clothes” I said. “Get your jacket.”

We went to ‘Boots and Bridles’ and got him boots, breeches and a helmet. \[“You are NOT riding without a helmet.”\]

When we got home, I tacked up Argon, my old gelding, now semi-retired. I put Jed on Argon and he rode walk and trot for half an hour. Damn, that kid has natural good position on a horse. After we put Argon away, we picked the paddocks and gave the horses their suppertime grain and hay.

Back in the house, I said “We both stink of horse. Take a long hot shower – your muscles are going to ache if you don’t – and then we’ll have supper.”

I showered myself and we ordered pizza.

After he inhaled a large pepperoni and a quarter of my meat lovers, we watched *Die Hard 2* until 9:30.

He insisted on coming out to give the horses their night hay. I noticed he took a few minutes to stroke Argon’s neck.

At the door of his bedroom, Jed stopped for a moment. “Mr. Benson,” he said “thank you. I know they’re putting pressure on you, but you don’t have to. I like you.” He went inside and closed the door.

I choked up a bit, looking at his door. I went in my own room and got in bed. I lay awake for a long time. Dammit. I like my life the way it was. I don’t want a son.

AITA if I don’t take in my biological son?

# Out of the Dark

Events compiled from Historical documents and accounts

December 4th, 2149

**Admiral**

—

Even the Frontier must have a fringe - an area of unknown that a budding civilization struggles to grapple with. It is where pioneers are forged and the forgotten fade into obscurity. Decades of war and strife have left a swathe of unfathomable destruction, the wounds still fresh even after the end of the Frontier War. Upon worlds left to fester after the IMC was pushed out, the Syndicate descended like vultures, carving out their own domains among the ruins, remaking worlds all the way to the edge of known space into their own little haven atop the corpse of corporate overextension. This infection, this disease, left untouched would spread towards the core of the Republic.

The very qualities that make this hive of lawlessness so unappealing is the exact reason why it is the perfect proving ground for promising naval officers. Be it IMC remnants or Syndicate fleets born high upon the blood of whole worlds, the Rim is the perfect place to see and experience the dark that writhes just outside of civilization's light.

Admiral Takeshi Arata exhaled, a cloud of condensation fading away as he set down a cup of coffee, overlooking silent men and women. A flotilla sliced through the dark - five ships tasked with cutting through the gloom. Takeshi looked out the view screen of the MCS Lastimosa, a sleek carrier justly named after a deceased Militia hero lost on Typhon in one of the last battles of the Frontier War leading the formation. Two cruisers, a destroyer, and a newly designed battlecruiser, the Chōwa, bristling with weapon hardpoints followed alongside. A formidable group, sufficiently well-armed to deal with whatever the Syndicate or the IMC has lurking out here. Their presence is a clear reminder to the residents of the Rim that the Militia will not abandon them like the IMC did.

A green light pulsed on the console nearest to him, drawing his attention. Setting his coffee aside, he tapped the control and a woman's visage materialized on the table in front of him. Memories of bonds    formed during the academy push their way to the surface. Sara Rosario, one of the only people he still kept in contact with and who, he hoped, enjoyed and tolerated his presence in their personal lives. And more importantly, captain of the MCS Chōwa, the Birmingham-class battlecruiser off our port side. Takeshi raised a hand in greeting, maintaining a neutral expression whilst quelling his turbulent mind.

“A distraction from my subpar coffee! What brings you to this patch of void, Sara?”

Sara smirked through the screen, a slight chuckle escaping her lips. “Nice to see you’re excited,” she acknowledged. Sliding a folder across the table, a sensor signature appeared. “We’ve picked up some ships a couple systems away, with our long-range scanners. No transponders, no response to our hails. Could be a group of miners from a local colony, could be smugglers. Either way, should be worth checking out.”

Takeshi leaned forward scrutinizing the limited information before reclining back into his seat. “Might be a good experience for the Chōwa’s shakedown cruise.” Straightening up, he motioned to a bridge officer nearby, “Helm, plot us a course to those signatures and inform the other captains that their vessels are to be combat-ready upon system entry.”

The officer acknowledged his order and started relaying orders to the Lastimosa’s crew and her accompanying escorts. Takeshi rested his hands on the railing in front of him, as the ship's thrusters roared to life, the ship's klaxon sounding off: “All hands, all hands to stations, we are responding to unknown contacts in system Helios-47B. All vessels are ordered to follow and undertake peacekeeping directives. Jump in 1 minute.”

Breathing in he felt the ship's thrusters quiet before the hum of the jump drive took its place. Clenching the railing until his knuckles turned white, Takeshi closed his eyes as the world dissolved into bending colors and lights, heralding humanity’s defiance of the laws of physics. “Fleet jumping in 3…2…1…mark!” the ship's PA announced.

Almost instantaneously, the set of stars before them blurred into specks of blinding white light before reforming into a new backdrop. Exhaling, Takeshi opened his eyes and froze. The bridge lapsed into silence, all eyes on the shapes in the void. Takeshi’s eyes narrowed, leaning forward as he took in the interlopers.

A fleet of vessels drifted, arrayed against the canvas of stars. The ships, jagged and almost fanged in their design, were burning hard for the system limit even as they watched. Some were intact; others were obviously damaged, venting gases and debris from various spots on their hulls as their thrusters died. They showed no clear formation, their movements frantic and disorganized, not one halting their escape to assist their disabled brethren.

The tension on the bridge broke into a measured chaos, bridge officers attending to their tasks. The fleet corrected its trajectory on manoeuvre thrusters towards the vessels in preparation to give chase. Takeshi sat back down, placing his hands into his lap, bracing himself for the ship's movements.

**Captain**

—

The Chōwa entered the system with its reactors running at 70%, its rushed construction having let manufacturing defects slip through. Grasping the railing as the ship shuddered, Sara stood, looking to her senior officers for information.

“What’s our status?”

“EW and Engineering need a few seconds, Captain. Issues with the reactor's output.”

Another bridge officer chimed in , “Ma’am, sensors lit up the moment we entered the system. Contacts match the pings we got. We’re waiting for the admiral to establish contact.”

Sara settled back into her chair, fingers tapping restlessly against the armrest. If Takeshi was running things by the book, nothing of note would happen in this system. Maybe she’d get a chance to catch an uninterrupted nap after this.

For precious few seconds, the bridge was silent, save for the hum of machinery and ventilation. The calm broke as an officer put his hand to his ear as he checked the screen readouts, “CIC is reporting multiple launches from our contacts. We’ve got confirmed vampires inbound, doesn’t look too severe, PD should take the brunt of it. Payload seems conventional…ROE’s just been broadcast.”

Sara rose from her chair as she considered the broadcast, stepping over to a console. Selecting a channel to address the crew, “All stations we are Condition 1, PID on all active vessels. Let’s show them what we can do.”

The ship shuddered as her engines burned toward the ragged fleet. Streams of metal reached out into the void, swiftly eliminating the meager threats. Hidden emplacements along the hull opened up to reveal rail cannons, barrels swiveling to quickly acquire targets.

Sara lowered herself back into the command chair, her eyes fixed on the deluge of data on the display, certain that her command crew were up to the task. The Chōwa rumbled as it unleashed fury upon the aggressors. For the first time, the newly minted vessel would draw blood.

**Cattle**

—

Pain permeated through every cell of the small sapients body. All hope of returning home had faded long before with their departure from Federation space. Several shots had come close to the raiding fleet, but still had failed in stopping them from leaving. She knew that the Federation's fleets would never dare to pursue the Arxur into unknown space.

Many of the \[7ft\] reptilian bipeds in the hold paced and lunged randomly at the occupants, chuckling as their prey shrank back. Others, however, stalked silently by, gashes visible on their emaciated frames, eyes alight with hate, frustrated that their prey could have wounded and harried them so.

As a particularly large specimen with a rather painful looking wound visible on its arm passed by, the small child shrunk into the corner, trying fruitlessly to shrink out of its sight. Still, it stalked ever closer, its serrated teeth forming a sadistic grin.

It grasped one hand on the bars of the pen door, making as if to swing them open. At that moment, the ship shuddered and groaned, debris flying through the air as components broke apart. The Arxur reeled, off balance, distracted by fires and shouted commands. Another impact tore a gash in the neighbouring compartment, sucking predator and prey alike into the void before emergency bulkheads slammed shut.

The sudden shift in atmosphere coupled with distant weapon fire sent the cattle pens into a frenzy. Arxur scrambled over themselves running towards weapons lockers and armoured compartments, many fighting for the few sidearms available. Abruptly, the reactor’s power cut off, plunging the space into darkness and throwing everything into weightlessness. Cries and snarls of confusion filled the air as predators and prey alike struggled to retain their footing and handholds. Then, just as suddenly, the power cycled back on, slamming bodies and debris to the ground.

**Arxur**

—

Yells from Arxur, knocked off balance, echoed through the various compartments, debris and cattle thrown every which way. Bloodied and wounded bodies lay strewn all around, their comrades either uncaring or unable to provide assistance. The crew slowly struggled to their feet, confusion rampant throughout. Rifles were passed out as hunters took up positions across the ship. As the occupants regained their balance, silence overtook the long rooms and hallways dotted with gore. In a compartment towards the middle of the ship, a heated line drew its way through the metal of the ship’s hull. The Arxur within tensed, eager to pounce on whatever prey was foolish enough to try to rescue their brethren. The line soon began to move in the opposite direction as well, the shape of the circle slowly making itself apparent. As the lines met, the slab remained in place, the glowing cutout still visible.

One of the Arxur stood up, trying to peer closer at the opening. In an explosion of sparks, a charge propelled the metal inwards, rocketing it towards the opposite wall, narrowly missing the spot where its head had been. Shock took hold for but a moment before every gun was emptied towards the new opening, a storm of lead flying through it.

The seconds of sustained gunfire was deafening, the cattle in the hold cringing, trying desperately to shield their ears from the onslaught of sound. The barrage died down, each Arxur having emptied their weapon, grasping for another magazine. As the lull intensified, their actions were interrupted by several small metal cylinders thrown into the compartment.

One such device’s roll was stopped by one of the higher ranked hunters. Inspecting it, the Arxur noted how the device was round and studded with blue protrusions, and decorated with blue stripes.

The hunter brought the device to his snout, sniffing it. Abruptly, the sphere exploded, blanketing the whole area in thick white smoke. Crackles of electricity coursed through the dense cloud, the shocks causing the Arxur to grunt in pain. Bursts of gunfire penetrated the smoke, removing appendages and brain matter. Soldiers clad from head to toe in combat gear advanced through the breach in the hull, methodically picking off the disoriented Arxur. As they encircled the survivors, many attempted to blindly rush through the smoke, swiping at any figure which appeared in their field of view. Most were cut down as they approached, their reckless assaults awarded only with lead. The ones that did manage to land a hit or draw blood were easily mopped up, their targets replaced by more helmeted soldiers.

The smoke cleared, as did the gunfire; the soldiers having secured a beachhead for their assault. Separate teams moved in, intermixed with squads of bipedal robotic figures. The cattle cowered as the machines passed, squinting due to the dual sources of light emanating from them. Many soldiers began taking in their surroundings, weapons hanging limply off shoulder slings. One man unlatched his helmet, reaching for his sidearm. He strode towards one of the cattle cages and flung the door open. An Arxur, blood pouring from a hole in its shoulder, was attempting to crawl towards a Venlil. Noticing the figure approaching, the predator redoubled its efforts, wrapping its claws around the being and swinging it around in an attempt to use it as a shield. The soldier ignored this, moving his arm up to point the gun at the Arxur’s head and pulling the trigger in a single movement. Its arm went slack, head bouncing off the wall, its body falling limp. The Venlil froze, staring up at the bipedal figure, its frightened gaze now fixed solely on the shadow towering above it.

As the man stared back in kind, a blur impacted his side. Falling to the ground with a grunt, another soldier reaches around, taking the weapon away from him.

Further into the vessel, the Arxur crew had closed the bulkheads leading throughout the ship, hoping to slow down the assailants. Breaching charges were set and shields brought up. The doors gave, mechanized forms pouring into the spaces within. More grenades were thrown in, detonating with flashes of sound and light. Rushing in, they disarmed and restrained the disorientated Arxur, occasionally kicking weapons from their outstretched claws.

In the bridge of the cattle vessel, officers hid behind makeshift cover, anxiously awaiting the attackers. The entryway melted open, as soldiers defended by mobile energy shields and arc batons rushed in. The crew frantically started shooting, the rounds absorbed or melted by the translucent barriers. As the shields close the distance, the soldiers behind step through them. As the arc enshrouded rods made contact with the surface of their scales, the Arxur yelled out in pain, the muscles in their body spasming and convulsing. Guns dropped from their fingertips and they too were restrained, knocked unconscious from the surge.

Towards the rear end of the vessel, the teams of soldiers met stiffer resistance. Held back by heavy weapon and anti-vehicle emplacements, their shields did not hold up long to the deluge of gunfire. Outside the ship, a vehicle lights up, the racks on its sides blinking green. Bulkier forms of steel and alloy detach from their housing, mechanical arms lowering them to the ship. In unison, they activated red strips of light on their faceplates and marched through the gaping rupture, having been enlarged to let stretchers and medical teams pass through.

In the hallway, the firefight continued, streaks of light passing up and down. The Arxur manning the anti-vehicle emplacement continued to fire, heavy metal casings beginning to pile up alongside. As the pile of shells alongside him ran low, he looked back, yelling at a fellow hunter to come help him reload the weapon. A case of shells was brought up and began to be slotted into the weapons hungry maw. Roaring in satisfaction, the gunner took another look back at the hallway and was taken aback. Multiple forms were advancing on their position. To his horror, they not only seem to be taking consecutive hits from anti-armor rounds, but even missing limbs did not seem to stop them. Frantically the hunters manning the barricade poured fire onto the machines, the horde drawing closer every second, barely slowing. Out of the corner of his vision a metal hand appeared, grasping the edge of the emplacement. A bisected robot, wires sparking from its abdomen, hauled itself over the lip as the Arxur watched in terror. As the hunter scrambled out of the seat, a body slammed into him, knocking him to the ground. Grunting, he pushed it off, the body missing whole chunks. Stumbling, he ran into the last cattle hold, other Arxur being gunned down beside him. Flinging open a cattle cage, he grabbed the nearest prey, a Venlil pup. It screamed as he grabbed hold, struggling futilely against his grip. In his mind, he knew that the other prey would not dare to kill him while he had leverage over their young. Backing towards a corner of the hold, he looked frantically around, as soldiers began to fill the space, shouting and yelling demands that he surrender and drop the child. Growling and hissing at them, he backed up further before bumping into something. Looking down, he registers that he is not yet at the wall. As he begins to ponder this thought, his airway closes, fingers gripping it.

The air smelled faintly of coffee and something sharper—earthy, tinged with rebellion. Rows of neatly tended cannabis plants lined the far corner, their soft green glow casting eerie shadows on the walls.

He worked in the digital shadows—freelancing under pseudonyms, coding clean websites for messy people. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was quiet. Predictable. Until tonight.

A sharp knock sliced through the silence, startling him from his trance. He hesitated. He didn’t get visitors. He didn’t *like* visitors. Peering through the peephole, he frowned. She stood there like she owned the night—dark hair damp from the rain, sharp cheekbones framed by the hood of her oversized sweater. Her eyes, half-hidden behind fogged glasses, were impossibly intense, a mix of vulnerability and defiance. 

“What?” he barked after cracking the door just enough for her to see him. 

“I need a safe place to crash.” Her voice was flat, the tone of someone who’d stopped asking for permission long ago. 

“Do I ""look"" like I run a hotel?” His gaze flicked over her, as sharp as his words.

“No.” Her lips twitched into the ghost of a smirk. “But you do look like someone who doesn’t call the cops.”

1jmd54g,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1jmd54g/third_date_advice/,Third date advice,"I (20M) have been seeing this girl (20F) over the past 3 weeks, we had our second date today and things have been going great. I haven’t been in the dating scene in over 2 years, so I’m still trying to figure things out, especially since my last relationship was in high school, I’m in college now and things are different in terms of expectations. We met through online dating, had a good connection over text, then met for coffee and had a great connection in person. She ended up saying at the end that she had a great time and suggested we get dinner next, so that’s what we did. That also went really well, we haven’t really done anything physical but honestly I think we’re both nervous, she mentioned at the end of our date today she didn’t get treated well in her last relationship and wanted to take things slow, I also have some anxiety so I refrained from trying to make any moves and figured it would be a better idea to wait until she seems ready. 

Now I’m currently stuck trying to think of a third date idea, my top ideas are either going to this arcade/bowling alley in the city or go for a walk (although it’s a bit too cold where we live to do right now). I was also thinking maybe we could do supper then go to the arcade, but I’m not sure if that’s too much. I was also thinking I could offer to give her a ride this time, especially if we plan multiple activities it would make things flow a bit better. Any advice for the next date or general advice for the future would be great, I can definitely see a future with this girl and I think she feels the same way.

My partner and I are coming to Vancouver for 3 days at the end of April, visiting my partner's younger brother who lives in Kits area. I'm looking for suggestions for transportation and in general things to do. We are 30 and 28, active, hoping to do a hike/kayak/explore the city and eat some good food (coffee shop and restaurant recos appreciated as well). Right now we have a reso at Ask for Luigi. We are staying around Yaletown and not planning to rent a car, I am wondering specifically about car sharing services because we would like to go to Squamish one day.

This is what I have so far: 

Friday - arrive around 9am. Explore gastown/shop/check out coffee shops then go over to Kits.

Saturday - hike in Squamish ?sea to summit. 
? Best way to get there - evo or modo tent a car? 

Sunday - deep cove kayaking - ?uber from downtown 
Explore Lynn canyon or do more DT exploring. 



Appreciate any and all tips!! 

Thanks!!

But, I won't lose hope and I hope you won't, too! \^\^

Let's make this straight to the point, shall we?

Looking for someone who is:

* About my age or older (this is negotiable)
* Taller than me - I'm 4""11' so it's not much of a challenge, I hope.
* Within Metro Manila - I can't handle long distance so I would prefer if you're within the vicinity that both of us can travel conveniently with or without the traffic.
* Loves to eat and hopefully not a picky eater - I would really appreciate someone whom I can share and exchange good places to eat
* Has PRISTINE hygiene - Let me emphasize this. PRISTINE HYGIENE. I don't wanna date someone who can casually say ""okay na 'to"" when it comes to hygiene. This is a very big deal breaker for me.
* Financially stable and responsible - as per Mr. Chinkee Tan, being financially stable is not enough.
* Knows how to respect each other's time - we have our own separate lives and deal with different priorities in life so it would mean a lot to me if you know how to respect boundaries.
* An intellectual who can handle and lead conversations - smart is still the new sexy. I'm sorry but I get red signals in my head when I come across using wrong words in a sentence (your/you're, were/we're).
* Pleasing to the eyes - though I'm a huge sucker for guys with glasses and nice nose (I blame Harry Potter for this)

And then, there's me:

* I'm 4'11"" but 4'11.5"" on a good day
* Overweight BMI (based on Asian standard) - since my current company is Japanese so we follow the Asian standard which is much stricter
* I work in the food industry and graduated BS Food Technology - this is my passion despite not having that much of a high salary compared to other professions so I freelance as a consultant as well for small business owners.
* Inked and currently have a total of 11 minimalist tattoos.
* Photography is my hobby and I like taking photos of basically anything except myself.
* I cook decent foods but my specialty is adobo which my friends love (I make it extra spicy by request).
* Into horror and psychological movies / series so basically into A24 movies & Junji Ito masterpiece (I'll let you guess my fave horror movie)
* Huge Potterhead and grew up watching LOTR, Narnia and several cartoon and animes
* A coffee-dependent human being who gets withdrawal headaches if I don't drink caffeine in a single day. I also brew my own coffee if I have time.
* Lives with my 2 adopted cats :"">

I hope you got all the way here and appreciate all your effort reaching this far.

If you're interested, you can message me anytime and we can exchange pictures once comfortable. \^\^",1,1743217477.0,PhR4Dating,3,0.67,False
1jmd01g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jmd01g,First week with my RP5. I'm in LOVE,"i'm new to dedicated android gaming handhelds but when i came across the rp5 i knew i had to have it. it finally came home this week and i think it just changed my life. 

it'll sound silly but some background: recently i've been emulating my games on a galaxy tab a9+ which honestly wasn't bad at all because it can handle nethersx2 and dolphin really well, but its a HUGE tablet and not at all handheld. i've also been struggling with chronic fatigue lately so sitting up at my gaming pc or hunched over my coffee table with a controller hooked up to my tablet after 8 hours of working my desk job every day has been breaking me down to the point where i barely felt like gaming anymore. the only thing i was really comfortable with was either lounging in bed with my switch or psvita, but both of them can only do so much.

i was originally on the fence trying to decide between a steam deck, odin 2, or ayaneo pocket, but when i finally came across the retroid pocket 5 it was a done deal. the all white model is just GORGEOUS. i even grabbed the 3d printed grip in pink so it would resemble my light pink and white psvita (they're so close in size that i keep saying they're sisters, not twins!) and i love how it looks with the pink joystick lights... as you can tell everything i own is pink so it fits right in.

after a week of loading up my games, testing my emulators, and tweaking the theme so it feels just right, my only complaint is i wish i got this sooner!! everything appears to run smooth like butter and so far i haven't run into any issues with my games. i can't believe this thing can handle ps2 and wii with what seems to be no problem at all. i likely won't try to emulate anything newer than those, especially since i still use my psvita and ps3 and switch regularly, but i'm just stunned by how much power this thing has, and i'm so happy that it's giving me motivation to finally dive back into my gaming backlog. unlike my tablet, i LOVE that i can hook it up to my tv and use it as a home console when i have the energy to sit up and game!

i mostly play jrpgs and final fantasy is my drug of choice (especially ffxiv, and despite the small screen it looks INCREDIBLE streamed from my pc via moonlight), but i caught the sonic bug thanks to the 3rd movie so i've been diving into all the old sonic games that i don't already have on ps3 and switch (somehow, the black knight has NOT been driving me insane with the wiimote controls and i'm really enjoying it!) i'm thrilled that i can finally play all these games i wanted to as a kid but never could because i didn't have every console that my friends and cousins did.

anyways, sorry for rambling but i just wanted to sing my praises to this awesome little device. i will still use my psvita for vita games and my psone classics that i can't carry my save files over for, but everything else will be played on my rp5. i love this thing and unfortunately i'm going to be really annoying about it to everyone i know now :)",43,1743217378.0,retroid,8,1.0,False

I was parked on a concrete lot far enough from the road that it shouldnt' have been related to vibrations from any traffic passing by.  It felt like sometimes an engine runs a little rough but my car is electric so it shouldn't be making any vibrations when idling.  I actually thought it might be an earthquake. It was wierd enough where I actually got out of the car but didn't feel anything once standing.  The moving sensation lasted for at least 30 seconds.

So In my opinion, there were sizmic warnings that an earthquake was going to happen.  People could have been warned.  I sincerely hope that they get that new warning system up by the end of the year.",11,1743217326.0,Bangkok,8,0.76,False

(15F),"Hi Reddit, just so you know Ive posted this on other subreddits so that I can get answers. I hope my thoughts are clear though and if you have any questions I can clarify for you let me know in the comments. 

I (16M) met this girl (15F), let’s call her M, at the start of this school year during auditions for a play. I’m a junior, she’s a freshman, and we didn’t get close until she started doing my makeup before shows. She immediately caught my eye. She has long dyed red hair, gothic style, and a confidence that makes her stand out in any room. She’s insanely talented (acting, dancing, sewing—you name it), and she knows it.

While doing my makeup, she’d talk about her older brother and shows she loved. We hit it off, started hanging out more, and I realized I really liked her. She’d call me cutie and other various nicknames, and at one point, we were at a fast food place with friends when she looked up at me and fluttered her lashes. I thought it was a sign that she liked me but I wanst sure.

Later, at a sleepover, she put on Lisa Frankenstein, and we joked about being like Lisa and the monster. I put my arm around her, and she started kissing my hand, which I didn’t even notice until she pointed it out. Then, she said, “I love you,” and I could tell she regretted it instantly. I told her not to, admitted I liked her too, and we ended up kissing and cuddling the rest of the night. But something felt off.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about how I wasn’t good enough for her, how my mental health would weigh her down, and how it just wasn’t the right time. I didn’t say anything right away because I struggle with communicating my feelings. A few days later, I called her to explain, but I was so anxious I wrote everything down in my notes app. Mid-call, my phone accidentally shared the note with her!!! Seeing her face drop was the worst feeling ever. She said she needed time to process, and I gave her space.

For the next few weeks, we barely talked, and it hurt so much seeing her in the hallway and not being able to say anything. Eventually, she texted me to meet up at a coffee shop. she told me she really loved and cared about me. I told her I felt the same but didn’t want to be with her because of my mental health. I knew she’d been in bad situationships before, and I didn’t want to put her through that again.

Fast forward a month, and she started flirting again. At the last show for our latest production, we both ended up at a cast sleepover. She cuddled up next to me, and I played with her hair the whole night, even trying to braid it (badly). It felt so natural, but we haven’t talked about it since.

Now, she’s distant again, and I don’t know what to do. My mental health is still in a weird place, and she deserves someone stable. But I also really care about her. Should I just let her go or try to fix things?

TL;DR: I like this girl, and she likes me, but I pulled away because of my mental health. After weeks of distance, she flirted again, and we cuddled at a sleepover, but now she’s distant. Not sure if I should try again or let her go.

Edit: I also feel as though I've been sending her mixed signals with me reciprocating her advances. I'm so confused please help!!!😭",1,1743216849.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

1jmcrk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditWritesSeinfeld/comments/1jmcrk7/the_kramer_method/,The Kramer Method,"Kramer stumbles into a new gig as a motivational speaker after being overheard passionately giving life advice to a stranger in a coffee shop. A corporate recruiter is so impressed with his energy and confidence that he hires Kramer on the spot to give weekly speeches to employees at an unnamed company. The problem? Kramer has no idea what the company actually does.

Jerry, George, and Elaine become obsessed with figuring it out, piecing together clues from the snippets of Kramer’s vague yet enthusiastic speeches. Kramer rants about “thinking outside the box” but never specifies what’s inside the box. He encourages employees to “push the envelope” but never clarifies what’s in the envelope. At one point, he advises them to “pivot, pivot, pivot!” leading George to suspect it’s a furniture company. Meanwhile, Jerry thinks it’s a financial firm, and Elaine is convinced it’s a shady pyramid scheme.

Determined to solve the mystery, George sneaks into one of Kramer’s seminars but leaves more confused than ever. Employees seem inspired but equally clueless about their own work. Jerry and Elaine dig deeper, only to find that the company has no website, no signage, and pays Kramer in unmarked checks.

The mystery is finally unraveled when Newman, who coincidentally works in the same building, reveals the truth—it’s not a business at all. Kramer has been giving pep talks at a support group for people struggling with indecision. None of them actually work there; they just keep showing up because of Kramer’s energy.

In the end, Kramer is unfazed. “So what if they don’t have jobs? They’ve got spirit!” he proclaims, as he leads his followers in an impromptu chant. Meanwhile, George, inspired by Kramer’s unearned success, tries his hand at motivational speaking—only to immediately be heckled off the stage.",4,1743216613.0,RedditWritesSeinfeld,1,0.84,False

Everything I do is never enough for my mother. I've been working since 2012 and I've bought her everything she needs. Clothes, handbags, shoes, perfume, make up, taking her out to lunch, coffee, movies, shopping, birthday gifts, mother's day gifts, I've even been doing groceries for the past 12 years. But she says I've never given her cash to carry.

She has a problem with how I talk. I can't discuss anything with her because it turns into an argument all the time. If I put forward my point of view, and it does not align with hers, then I'm the one who's wrong. 

I don't think I like her anymore. She talks so sweetly to everyone else and then talks to me like I'm the scum of the earth. And I'm worried about the relationship I'm going to have with my soon to be mother in law because I don't have a good relationship with my own mother.

I just wish she would see me as a separate individual with my own thoughts and life, instead of an extension of her who will do exactly everything she says.

I'm sorry if I'm rambling. I don't have anyone else to talk to except my fiancé.

Maybe worse. Terrible.

It will turn around eventually, simply because there is so much money to be made on a patented, effective treatment. But the going will be rough in the meantime. We need a few big, blockbuster deals to turn things around.

In the meantime, here are a few things to consider:

1) Developing cures is an innately rewarding activity. Your work matters. This is not true for most careers.

2) The pay is generally good, allowing you to live within your means and accumulate a big safety fund and retirement portfolio. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

3) You will probably get laid off, and you will definately be someplace where there are layoffs. It is customary in these situations to assume that the company just cut the low-performing slackers, but the reality is that these decisions are made without much precision. Slackers will be retained and stars booted. I have seen it over and over.

4) If you are not laid off, FFS reach out to those who were. It is incredibly traumatic, and you can forge bonds that will serve you for the rest of your career. 

5) You should probably switch jobs every 3-4 years or so if you want to maximize your position. Companies are very slow to promote or give raises to people already there. Plus you will maximize your ""steep learning curve"" time.

6) Keep your network strong. You will need it throughout your career. Make time to have a cup of coffee with a former colleague, speak at conferences, etc.

Things are going to be extra tough as an already bad job market is flooded with people jettisoned from government jobs. Try to keep a sense of humor. You have put a lot of work into getting where you are, and it isn't nothing. Good luck, y'all. ",84,1743216581.0,biotech,6,0.99,False

**Part 3: Cousin Time (Sayuri)**

Sayuri pushed a few strands of her blood-red hair out of her eyes with her right hand as she entered the code to her door with her left. The lock clicked and she turned the door handle to enter. Gray tiled floors greeted her in the entry foyer, along with gray walls and white closets. The condo was centered around a living room, with a small kitchen and dining area to the right and a bedroom and bathroom to the left.

She examined the living room as she set down her violin case in the closet, taking in the gray carpet, the couch that was upholstered in a blue and white twill pattern, a matching chair, and a coffee table situated between them creating a sitting area. On the wall hung a large flat screen television.

*They weren’t kidding when they said these places were furnished. I can’t believe this is all for me…in just a few weeks I’ve got from being a test file that never should have been compiled to being a real human being to all of this. What did I do to deserve this? It is a bit gray in here though…I’ll need to get some art for the walls.*

On the coffee table sat an envelope, which she opened to find a note from the FXI CFO and a plastic card. Sayuri quickly scanned the note, which included details on the bank account and credit card that had been established for her. She pocketed the card and proceeded to the kitchen, admiring the stainless steel appliances and granite countertops.

*Maybe we could have a girls’ night in and all cook dinner together and watch a movie one night or something. That could be fun.*

Sayuri yawned as fatigue from the previous days’ events began to overcome her excited energy.

*A nap wouldn’t be bad right now. I’ve got half an hour before we need to meet back up. I’ll go and lie down for a bit.*

She walked to the bedroom, which featured a king-sized bed with white linens, a small desk, nightstands, a dresser, closet, and a small couch. Walking over to the floor to ceiling windows she opened the sheer curtains, allowing her to look out to the city, the park across from the tower, and other buildings in the vicinity.

*I can’t complain about the view, that’s for sure. This will be really cool at night when everything is lit up.*

Sayuri removed her taupe blazer, red neck ribbon, purple hair clip, and tan sweater, hanging them in the closet. She kicked off her shoes, unbuttoned her shirt, unzipped her skirt, and sat down on the bed in her white bodysuit and socks.

*This bed is so comfortable…I already feel sleepy. Definitely going to have to expand my wardrobe though soon and add some cute outfits to my closet beyond my uniform…I hope I don’t oversleep and miss the next regroup. I can’t wait to go shopping with everyone.*

She put her head on the pillow and closed her eyes, feeling relaxed and losing herself in her thoughts.

*I shouldn’t even exist, but here I am. For that matter, I shouldn’t have even existed in our digital reality let alone the real world. Just a test file that got accidentally compiled. I’m so lucky. I’ve got family and friends, a great place to live, and a date to look forward to. What more could a girl want?*

Sayuri drifted off to sleep with a contented smile on her face.

Her rest, however, was cut very short by someone knocking on the door.

“Huh? Who is it?” Sayuri asked groggily as she climbed out of bed, pulled on her skirt, and quickly pulled on and buttoned her shirt.

She walked to the door and opened it to find Sayori, Natsuki, and Yuri looking concerned. Sayori looked a bit disheveled, her shirt untucked and her red hair bow sitting on her right side rather than its usual place on her left. Natsuki and Yuri looked more presentable, their uniforms complete and tidy.

*Looks like Sayori must have tried to take a nap too.*

“Oh, hi everyone,” Sayuri greeted them, “Is everything okay?”

“Everything’s great with our condos,” Natsuki began, “But there is a problem. Listen for a second. Can you hear that?”

Sayuri paused. The only noise she could hear was the soft hum of the air conditioning system.

*Huh?*

“What am I supposed to be hearing?”

Natsuki shook her head. “That’s not it. Listen to what you’re not hearing.”

“I’m confused,” Sayuri replied, puzzled.

“Allow me to explain,” Yuri said, “For the duration of our virtual existence, the simulation featured a soundtrack. Perhaps we did not notice it until now in our excitement, but this world does not appear to have the same constant background music. We all find this to be rather disconcerting and wanted to get your thoughts on this matter.”

“Ohhh…,” Sayuri nodded, “I guess I never really noticed that. Maybe it’s because I wasn’t part of the simulated world for as long as you all were, but quiet doesn’t really bother me.”

“There are clearly parts of this world that do have music all the time,” Sayori added, “Like when we were in the lobby of the tower or on the floor with all the restaurants and shops. But not here. I tried to sleep but I couldn’t. It was weird…the silence was just too overwhelming!”

Sayuri frowned, concerned for her cousins’ and friend’s distress.

*She’s already struggling with her feelings and now this experience. I think I need to take her somewhere to get her mind off all this.*

“I’m sure it must be difficult for you all,” Sayuri said sympathetically, “Maybe we can find a way to create the background noise you want. By the way, where are Monika and MC?”

Natsuki shrugged. “I think they must have fallen asleep. We knocked on Monika’s door, but she didn’t answer, and I heard snoring noises through the door when we walked by MC’s place.”

“We appear to be under no time constraints, so we thought it best to leave Monika to her slumber,” Yuri added, “While we have planned to meet up in half an hour, it is obviously not a hard deadline.”

“Hey Yuri, while we’re waiting for Monika and MC to wake up, I want to get your opinion on something,” Natsuki said, “I’m trying to figure out how to best make use of space in my living room, and since our places are identical, I figured we could work through it together and think up some good ideas. I need to store my manga, you’ll want to display your knives…we can come up with the best layouts together.”

Yuri contemplated. “Yes, I had been pondering how best to display my knives in way that they will be both clearly visible and safe. I admit that I was once somewhat ashamed of my hobby, but now that I have my own space it has given me new confidence and I’m sure it has done the same for you. I’m sure that with our combined insights, we can come up with ideal display solutions.”

“We’ll catch up with you girls in a bit,” Natuski said with a grin, turning back towards her door.

As Natsuki and Yuri left, Sayuri turned to her cousin. “Sayori, since it seems we have some time to ourselves, how do you feel about going upstairs, grabbing a coffee, and chatting for a bit? Everything’s been going so fast, but I wanted us to have some cousin time too.”

Sayori’s face lit up. “Absolutely! Cousin time and coffee both sound great! Let me just straighten out my clothes a bit and then we can go.”

She walked to her door and entered her code, quickly disappearing into her home.

Yuri looked over her shoulder. “Please let me know if they have tea as well and if it appears to be of good quality. Cousins don’t let cousins drink bad beverages. We’ll journey upstairs to come meet you when everyone is ready to explore the building more.”

Sayuri grinned. “We’ll have to see what the options are.”

*I admire Yuri’s passion. It’s funny how someone can have such a strong opinion on something like coffee or tea. I wonder what passions I will find…I was never programmed with any specific hobbies.*

Sayuri returned to her bedroom, putting her sweater, neck ribbon, blazer, and shoes back on. Her expression faltered as she thought about her original programming.

*I wasn’t really programmed with much of anything other than my appearance and some personality traits that are meant to make me similar to my cousins. There was no place in the story for another member of the Literature Club…I’m just that strange red-haired girl who showed up one day. Why do I exist? Why am I here? Whatever the reason, I’m just lucky I’m here.*

Before Sayuri could further contemplate the reasons for her existence, Sayori returned. Her bow was now in its usual place, and she had fixed her shirt and skirt. She called out to her cousin from the doorway.

“Ready to go, Sayuri?”

Sayuri nodded, and the two young women walked together to the center of the floor and took the escalators up two flights to the 60th floor.

“I think the coffee shop was this way,” Sayuri said, gesturing to the right.

“There it is,” Sayori pointed to a sign that said “COFFEE TEA TIRAMISU” in large letters.

“Any idea what tiramisu is?” Sayuri asked.

“I don’t know, but it looks good. Let’s go!” Sayori replied, stepping into the café, which featured natural wood furnishings for a very organic appearance which contrasted with the polished granite-look tiles of the hallway. Classical music played quietly in the background.

“This music isn’t bad for background noise,” Sayori observed, “It’s very calming.”

The cousins stepped up to the counter to order, which was being managed by a young woman who seemed to be about their age.

“Welcome to Coffee, Tea, Tiramisu,” she greeted them, “What can I get for you today?”

“Hi! I’m Sayuri, and this is Sayori. And umm…I actually don’t know. This is our first time here. We just moved into the building,” Sayuri said, slightly self-conscious, “I know I’d like something to drink, but what would you recommend? Coffee or tea?”

“I’d suggest an iced latte,” the manager replied, mildly confused by Sayuri’s introduction, “It’s one of our most popular drinks and balances the coffee flavor with some sweetness.”

Sayuri nodded. “I’ll have one of those then, please. I have a cousin who strongly prefers tea, but I feel like I should try coffee today.”

“It’s her other cousin, Yuri, who thinks so strongly about tea,” Sayori clarified, “I’m not quite as passionate about it, so I would like one of those lattes as well, please.”

“Oh, so you two are cousins?” the manager asked, glancing between the two young women standing at the counter, “I can see the resemblance. Okay, so we’ve got two iced lattes…any dessert to go with that?”

Sayori nodded emphatically. “Yes, we’d like to try to some tiramisu too.”

“Certainly,” the manager replied, totaling up the bill on the cash register, “Would you like that for here or to go?”

“For here, please,” Sayuri said, handing the manager her credit card, “It’s good to know for the future that we can get it to go though.”

The manager nodded. “Okay. And if you don’t mind me asking, what kind of contacts are you wearing? I really like the purple thing you’ve got going on. You’ve got this whole anime girl vibe that’s pretty cool.”

Confusion came over Sayuri’s face. “Contacts?”

The manager looked surprised. “Yeah, you know. Your eyes. The bluish-purple looks great but it’s obviously not your natural color. Just curious what brand of contact lenses you’re wearing.”

Sayuri froze. *Has she guessed that we’re not natural? Or do people here just change their eye colors with contact lenses?*

“Oh, well…my eyes have been this color for so long I don’t really recall off the top of my head,” Sayuri said cautiously, “We live in the building though so I’m sure we’ll be back soon. I’ll double check and let you know next time we’re here.”

The manager smiled as she handed Sayuri her receipt. “No worries. Thank you for coming in and enjoy your coffee and tiramisu.”

Sayuri thanked the manager, followed Sayori to a table, and sat down. The drinks and dessert were delivered quickly on a dark wood tray. The two cousins looked over the tall glasses containing their iced lattes and the plate of tiramisu in the middle.

“This looks good,” Sayori said, picking up her glass and taking a long sip from the straw, “And it’s really sweet! I like this a lot.”

 “Don’t get too enamored with it…you’ll make Yuri sad,” Sayuri teased, before switching her voice to a fair imitation of Yuri’s more formal tones, “After all, tea is the one true beverage.”

Sayori giggled. “You’re funny. They do have tea as well though, and it looked good, so we should recommend this place to her. I think she would like it. Thanks for paying, by the way. Where did you get that card?”

Sayuri took a sip from her glass. “Yeah…this is good. And the card was in the packet in my apartment. I assumed we all got them. Did you not see yours?”

“Oops,” Sayori said with a shake of her head, “I saw the envelope, but I didn’t open it. Remind me to go grab it before we go shopping.”

Sayori and Sayuri sat in silence for a long moment, enjoying their coffee and the ambiance of the café.

“So…do you think anyone here has any idea that we’re not…normal?” Sayuri asked, glancing back at the manager, “The store manager thought my eye color was unnatural at least. I wonder if it’s common for people to change their eye color here?”

“I think she just thought your eyes looked cool,” Sayori replied with a shrug, “I wouldn’t worry too much about it. We should come up with an explanation though for if we get asked about our appearance.”

Sayuri looked around at the other patrons in the café. “The good news is that we pretty much blend in here except for our hair and eye colors. And our clothes, but we’ll change that when we go shopping. I’m glad that when we came here, we didn’t end up retaining our anime style appearance.”

Sayori smiled. “Definitely. I’m looking forward to getting some cute new outfits, but I’m happy with how I look. Are you?”

Sayuri nodded, leaning back in her chair and putting her hands behind her head in a posture of relaxation. “Yes, I am. I just…I guess I still kinda can’t believe that I’m here, you know? After everything that happened there were times when I really didn’t think I would make it. And now I’m sitting in a cool café with my cousin having a nice time. I have a home. I have family and friends. It’s…we’re so lucky.”

Sayori considered, her expression flickering. “Yeah. It’s pretty amazing. It really is. But I’m having trouble really feeling excited…I’m trying to put on an enthusiastic face because that will help everyone else be happy. It’s like I want to be happy, but something just keeps telling me that I’m worthless and shouldn’t even be here and that the FXI guys only brought me here because they felt bad for me. I just wish I knew how to make these thoughts stop. I wish I could feel the way you do and really feel how lucky we are to be here.”

Sayuri gave her cousin an encouraging smile. “Sayori, it’s okay not to feel one hundred percent all the time. It’s okay if you’re not feeling excited. You’ve been through a lot. But we all love you and care about you. And I’m so grateful to have you as my cousin. When I first…arrived…to the Literature Club, you made me feel welcome even though I was an emotionless mess of a test file who wasn’t even supposed to exist. You made me feel like a part of the group immediately and I was so thrilled when I found out we were family. You belong here, Sayori. They didn’t bring you here because of pity. They brought you here because you’re worth it.”

Sayori met Sayuri’s eyes, visibly struggling internally.  “I was so happy to find out that we were cousins too. But we almost lost you when that glitch hit the simulation, and you gave up your chance to come here so that Monika could have her dream and we thought the MES people were going to take you for some horrible experiments…”

Her voice trailed off as she thought back to the events that had taken place in the control room of Metaverse Enterprise Solutions’ universal constructor, the nanotech factory that had allowed the members of the Literature Club to leave their digital reality and enter the real world fully human.

“I’m so glad we didn’t lose you,” Sayori said, her voice barely above a whisper, “You’re my family. I don’t know what I would have done if I had lost you. I think that would have been more than just rain clouds…that would have been an entire hurricane.”

Sayuri smiled reassuringly. “We all made it, in no small part thanks to our new friends. Between the FXI guys and the Music Club, they all really did a lot for us. Speaking of which, how do you like your new home?”

Sayori’s expression returned to a smile as she pushed her negative thoughts to the side with the change of topic. “It’s really great. I love having all of that space, and I like that it’s nice and new and clean…my old room was always messy. I tried to get MC to help me clean it up, but he never did.”

Sayuri laughed. “I don’t know if cleaning your room is among a boyfriend’s duties. But yeah, it is nice that everything is new. I would like to liven my place up a bit with some art though. Oh, and we should also totally have a girls’ night in soon when we all get together and cook and watch a movie.”

“Ohh…that’s a great idea,” Sayori replied with excitement, “Let’s definitely plan that soon.”

“Depending on how things go for me, maybe there could also be a double date with you and MC in the future,” Sayuri suggested, “Remind me to find a cute dress for date night by the way.”

Sayori nodded. “Yeah, that could be fun…I know MC mentioned he was planning a date night soon so I’m looking forward to that and I’ll definitely need to find a cute dress too. But honestly…do you think he’s really going to take me out for date night? I trust him, I really do, but sometimes I feel like he’s still kinda dense and don’t want to get my hopes up only to have him not follow through.”

Sayuri held up a hand. “Sayori, MC confessed his love for you in front of the whole club, and I’ve seen the way he looks at you. I really don’t think he has eyes for anyone else and I don’t think he would want to disappoint you.”

Sayori smiled. “I suppose you’re right. Maybe I’m overreacting. Thanks for listening to my concerns and drama and reminding me that things are pretty good. I feel like I’m usually the one telling others everything will be okay. It’s nice to have someone tell me that too.”

Sayuri returned her smile. “Of course. I’m always here to support you and listen. That’s what cousins are for. On another topic, have you thought at all what you think you’re going to try to do for a job?”

Sayori shook her head. “I’ve started thinking about a few ideas, but nothing really firm yet. I’m going to take a few weeks to get settled in here and then figure it out.”

Sayuri nodded. “That’s probably a good idea. I’ve thought about potentially getting some kind of graduate degree instead of working immediately. Maybe something in business.”

Sayori leaned forward in her chair, picked up a fork, and cut off a piece of the tiramisu, “I’m sure we’ll all figure it out. But we have time to think about it. For now, we have dessert in front of us that needs to be sampled.”

“Absolutely,” Sayuri agreed, picking up her own fork.

Sayori’s eyes became wide as she took a bite of the layered dessert.

“Oh. My. Goodness,” she said, staring at the dessert with wide eyes, “I think this is the best thing I’ve ever eaten.”

Sayuri grinned. “That good, huh?”

She followed Sayori’s lead and ate a small bite of tiramisu.

“Oh, wow. You’re right. That is spectacular.”

*This is a wonderful dessert, and it’s so good to see her smiling. Maybe all she needed was something to take her mind off of things for a bit.*

The dessert was quickly finished, and Sayori glanced at the empty plate ruefully before looking up at the red-haired young woman sitting across from her with a smile. “Thanks, Sayuri. I needed this. It’s been nice to have some cousin time and relax. Sitting together and enjoying a spectacular dessert like this…it helps me feel like maybe things could be alright.”

Sayuri nodded. “For sure. We really haven’t been able to spend much one-on-one time together since…we got here. I hope we can do this again soon.”

Sayori returned the nod emphatically. “For sure. And I’m definitely asking MC to take me here for dessert when we do date night.”

Sayuri smiled. “I think that’s a great idea.”

As they stood to leave and cleared their tray, they saw Natsuki, Yuri, and Monika walking down the hall to meet them. Monika gave a friendly wave as the group approached the café.

“How was it?” Monika asked, studying the menu displayed on flat-screen TVs above the counter.

“Tiramisu is delicious and the iced lattes were good and make me feel energized!” Sayori declared happily.

Yuri rolled her eyes but said nothing.

“Good to know,” Monika replied with amusement, “We were about to go check out the library on B1 and then do some shopping if you want to join us. The library might be a good place for us to continue Literature Club meetings if we all want to do that.”

“Sounds like fun,” Sayori agreed, “But let me guess: MC is still asleep and snoring?”

Monika gave a short laugh and shook her head. “No. He woke up shortly after you two came up here and went down to the sixth floor with the FXI guys to check out some video games they have in their office and to chat with them about his new job.”

“That’s putting it nicely,” Natsuki added, “What he actually said was ‘shopping is boooring.’ Typical MC.”

Sayori giggled. “Yep. That’s MC. But that’s okay. I’m glad to hear that he’s already thinking about his new job.”

“Before I forget, the FXI guys brought these for us,” Monika said, pulling two smartphones, one with a red case and one with a blue case, out of the pockets of her skirt, “These two are for you.”

Sayuri turned to Sayori. “Oh nice. That will be very helpful to have these. Any preference on color?”

“I’d like the blue one if that’s cool with you,” Sayori replied.

Sayuri nodded. “I wanted the red one anyway, so it works out perfectly.”

Monika handed the phones to Sayuri and Sayori, who placed them in the pockets of their skirts.

Natsuki gestured towards the elevator bay excitedly. “Alright. To the library!”",2,1743216570.0,DDLC,1,1.0,False

Would like to ask will timemore 078 has this kind of problem, or any other user of df64v also face this or not face this.
And other question would be the differences between 078 and df64v with ssp mp. From the workflow point of view and taste point of view. Will the taste difference be like zp6 and ssp mp?",1,1743216542.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

I’m hugeeee on growth, healing, and wellness yk so my business is like that. I absolutely loooove to help people. It’s just my passion and calling. My business is called The Healing Coven (THC😏) and it’s like a blend of witchcraft, mental health coaching, apothecary goods, and stonerrrr shit. I’m very creative and make some resin goods toooo. Honestly, my energy shifts a lot and some days I’m more of a hyper-productive tornado and others I just want to be left alone bc I need to recharge lol. So some days I may be texting u back after seconds whereas other days, I won’t answer bc it’s my self care, no screen day lol. I am very deep and I value honesty, loyalty, dark humor lol, and someone who actuallly cares. Checking in and making sure you’re good is my love language fr. I wanna make sure ur good ts. Anyways, I am a vibe lol. I have a ton of ideas, I like to do a lot, and rarely anything holds me back. I have IC and endo too btw. So I do have some hard times yk but it’s just a small little piece of the cake that makes me lol. Alsoooo I looooove iced coffee and cranberry juice. I love steak, pasta, pho, potstickers, ouuuu and weed. I love weed. Huge stoner right here. I also love some other stuff too. I like spiritual awakenings and trips so yk 😏. My favorite 2 animals are polar bears and crows. Fav colors are black most definitely, a beige type of brown so like sepia, and then a dark forest green and a sage green. I have like 42-43 tattoos and I do some tats myself. I also have 2 tongue piercings, a septum, and my ears have gauges. I used to pierce and tattoo. I still do but moving onto more yk. 



🕯️What do you enjoy doing in your free time?

I loveeee to cook, read, write, paint, draw, tattoo, organize shit, drive, listen to music or watch my comfort shows/movies. 



🕯️How would you describe your personality?

I am a very deep, introspective person. I have a fun and chaotic side but can also be nonchalant and calm ash. I can be very quiet or pretty crackhead depending on the scenario and day. I can be very blunt but also very caring. I am independent ash but love deep connections. And when I say deep, I mean D E E P. I feel like I’m the blond and brunette friend duo in one. I’m the sun and the moon together lol. Yin and yang ts. I love structure but also value flexibility. I am a big problem solver. I have a pretty sharp mind. Resilient. Creative asf. I’m always looking to improve myself and my life for the better. I ask way too many questions sometimes but I just always want to learn and know more. I don’t tolerate bs at all tbh. I am also reallyyyy smart. Alsoooo, I love being there for people and all. I love the deep connection but I also do need my own space yk. Sometimes I need to recharge or just be by myself for a lil. 



🕯️What’s a fun fact about you or something people might not know at first glance?

I’ve been hit by a car then he tried to kidnap me lol. 
Also I graduated high school at 16, am now graduating uni at 20 :) 



🕯️What are you looking for in a friend?

I want somebody with similar interests as me. Someone who is loyal, funny and down to talk about anything, someone who is empathetic and can feel for me like I can for them. I also want somebody who lifts me up, as I will them. I don’t like when females put other females down like cmon now. I wanna lift each other up. Raise one another’s vibrations. Maybe someone who is spiritual like I am? I want someone who wants the same kind of friendship as well. We don’t have to be connected at the hip lol but it would be nice to talk all the time and be there when one of us needs to vent or laugh or wtv. 



🕯️What’s your preferred way of communicating?

Texting is my favorite way of communicating. I am not one to call, I tend to get rlly busy sometimes but I would be willing to meet in person if possible too yk. 



🕯️How often do you like to hang out or stay in touch with friends?

I love deep frequent conversations. Let’s chat it up everyday. We don’t need to give each other 10 hours of our time a day just talking deep. I want it to be yk different. One day we talk deep, the next we talking goofy with each other. It doesn’t need to be that serious. I want a long term connection. A bestie. But it’s rlly not like we have to talk everyday just yk… want someone who is present. 



🕯️What’s most important to you in a friendship?

I would probably say support and trust. 



🕯️What do you value in conversations or interactions with friends?

Deep talks, jokes, being able to vent, and shared silence where there’s no expectations. 



🕯️Do you have any pet peeves or things that might turn you off in a friendship?

Being disrespectful or being lowkey disrespectful in jokes and shit. Lack of communication. Constant negativity. Talking down on everybodyyyy. Not being able to take a joke… 



🕯️How do you feel about traveling or meeting up in person?

I looooove traveling and would eventually be down yk. I do have social anxiety and it can be hard for me to meetup or do calls and things like that. Im working on it yk but be patient, we dont know what the future holds. I would eventually want to yk. 



🕯️Are you interested in exploring new activities with a friend?

Most definitely. I love learning new skills and just learning or growing in general. 




🕯️How would you handle conflict or disagreements in a friendship?

Honestly maybe take a second then come back later. Maybe just calm down the situation and then sit down and figure it out, as adults. No fighting or yelling. Tell me what’s going on and I’ll do the same. We will sit there and handle it till it’s resolved. If u can’t do that, then we can’t be friends. Being petty, rude, and disrespectful is not for me. Just bc we have an argument, doesn’t mean u throw respect out the window lol. Handle this shit w me like adults. 



🕯️What’s something you’re working on personally (growth, goals, etc.) that a friend might support you in?

Honestly my own growth and personal development. I have so many goals. I have some problems yk, health wise mainly and so my routine has been so out of wack. I am trying to get on track, make a plan and goals, then start on my journey of getting myself up and going yk. I wanna be healthier (in all aspects so spiritually, mentally, physically, etc) and reach my cool. If you could support me in that, I would always do the same and that would be awesome. 



🕯️Is there anything specific you’d like to share to help us understand you better?

I am a witch so I am very spiritual. I was born into it and grew up in it as well. My whole life my families were always split and half was Christian whereas the other half was catholic. My mom and immediate family were witches and so were some of my other ancestors. I have been around religion my whole life and have some minimal trauma yk. I have always been hated on for being a witch and into witchcraft. This is why I want a friend who is into the same things as I am. I don’t hate on religion at all, it’s just not my cup of tea. But when you come to me saying I’m going to hell, of course ima bash on u cause what?? No I do not worship the devil. No i do not sacrifice babies. No I am not evil. I have been bashed on for so much that’s not even true lol. I believe in the universe and spirit. I do not believe in god or the devil. I manifest, I don’t pray. I do spells and rituals but honestly a lot of them are to better myself and help me with my journey. I’m not sitting there casting love spells on your dad, chill! 



🕯️Why should someone want to be friends with you?

Honestly I am reallyyyy fucking dope man. I am loyal as fuck, funny ash, smart as shit, and just a good ass friend. If u need me im there. I mean if u call me I probably won’t answer but if u text me im right there for you dawg. I’m like a whole ass mental health coach like actuallyyy so I got you with whatever mannn. Need some advice? I’m a pro. Need a shoulder to cry on? I’m all in. Need to let some shit out ? Shit I gotchu man I’ll let some shit out with you. Just need anything in general? I am ready and already by yo side! Butttttt the second I see you’re not there for me in the same way?? I’m gone. I have always been the giver and never the receiver and I am no longer taking that yk. So cmon if u want that, at least be willing to give out too yk. 



🕯️Anything else you’d like to add?

Honestly not really. Just text me and get to know me. Don’t be dry or be basic ash. I hate that shit and it will die out quick trust. I’m too deep for shallow talks. Text me and tell me why your dad left your mom. Tell me why you’re missing a finger. I wanna know everything yk. Be unique, that’s what I’m looking for. Need my soul sister, my bestie boo yfm. 



P.S. a lot of shit that I say I’m just joking yk. I’m sarcastic as fuck. U might think I’m like a lover girl or some shit and whole time I’m just joshin. I am a lover girl but I’m not gonna sit here and be all cringe sorry. If u think I am, I’m most definitely laughing at myself. 

If you’re a Scorpio, that’s a plus and u should definitely text me like rnnnn. 

Also if u read alllll of this, props to u. 😏🥰🖤

I’m always looking to improve myself and my life for the better. I ask way too many questions sometimes but I just always want to learn and know more. I don’t tolerate bs at all tbh. I am also reallyyyy smart. Alsoooo, I love being there for people and all. I love the deep connection but I also do need my own space yk. Sometimes I need to recharge or just be by myself for a lil. 



🕯️What’s a fun fact about you or something people might not know at first glance?

I’ve been hit by a car then he tried to kidnap me lol. 
Also I graduated high school at 16, am now graduating uni at 20 :) 



🕯️What are you looking for in a friend?

I want somebody with similar interests as me. Someone who is loyal, funny and down to talk about anything, someone who is empathetic and can feel for me like I can for them. I also want somebody who lifts me up, as I will them. I don’t like when females put other females down like cmon now. I wanna lift each other up. Raise one another’s vibrations. Maybe someone who is spiritual like I am? I want someone who wants the same kind of friendship as well. We don’t have to be connected at the hip lol but it would be nice to talk all the time and be there when one of us needs to vent or laugh or wtv. 



🕯️What’s your preferred way of communicating?

Texting is my favorite way of communicating. I am not one to call, I tend to get rlly busy sometimes but I would be willing to meet in person if possible too yk. 



🕯️How often do you like to hang out or stay in touch with friends?

I love deep frequent conversations. Let’s chat it up everyday. We don’t need to give each other 10 hours of our time a day just talking deep. I want it to be yk different. One day we talk deep, the next we talking goofy with each other. It doesn’t need to be that serious. I want a long term connection. A bestie. But it’s rlly not like we have to talk everyday just yk… want someone who is present. 



🕯️What’s most important to you in a friendship?

I would probably say support and trust. 



🕯️What do you value in conversations or interactions with friends?

Deep talks, jokes, being able to vent, and shared silence where there’s no expectations. 



🕯️Do you have any pet peeves or things that might turn you off in a friendship?

Being disrespectful or being lowkey disrespectful in jokes and shit. Lack of communication. Constant negativity. Talking down on everybodyyyy. Not being able to take a joke… 



🕯️How do you feel about traveling or meeting up in person?

I looooove traveling and would eventually be down yk. I do have social anxiety and it can be hard for me to meetup or do calls and things like that. Im working on it yk but be patient, we dont know what the future holds. I would eventually want to yk. 



🕯️Are you interested in exploring new activities with a friend?

Most definitely. I love learning new skills and just learning or growing in general. 




🕯️How would you handle conflict or disagreements in a friendship?

Honestly maybe take a second then come back later. Maybe just calm down the situation and then sit down and figure it out, as adults. No fighting or yelling. Tell me what’s going on and I’ll do the same. We will sit there and handle it till it’s resolved. If u can’t do that, then we can’t be friends. Being petty, rude, and disrespectful is not for me. Just bc we have an argument, doesn’t mean u throw respect out the window lol. Handle this shit w me like adults. 



🕯️What’s something you’re working on personally (growth, goals, etc.) that a friend might support you in?

Honestly my own growth and personal development. I have so many goals. I have some problems yk, health wise mainly and so my routine has been so out of wack. I am trying to get on track, make a plan and goals, then start on my journey of getting myself up and going yk. I wanna be healthier (in all aspects so spiritually, mentally, physically, etc) and reach my cool. If you could support me in that, I would always do the same and that would be awesome. 



🕯️Is there anything specific you’d like to share to help us understand you better?

I am a witch so I am very spiritual. I was born into it and grew up in it as well. My whole life my families were always split and half was Christian whereas the other half was catholic. My mom and immediate family were witches and so were some of my other ancestors. I have been around religion my whole life and have some minimal trauma yk. I have always been hated on for being a witch and into witchcraft. This is why I want a friend who is into the same things as I am. I don’t hate on religion at all, it’s just not my cup of tea. But when you come to me saying I’m going to hell, of course ima bash on u cause what?? No I do not worship the devil. No i do not sacrifice babies. No I am not evil. I have been bashed on for so much that’s not even true lol. I believe in the universe and spirit. I do not believe in god or the devil. I manifest, I don’t pray. I do spells and rituals but honestly a lot of them are to better myself and help me with my journey. I’m not sitting there casting love spells on your dad, chill! 



🕯️Why should someone want to be friends with you?

Honestly I am reallyyyy fucking dope man. I am loyal as fuck, funny ash, smart as shit, and just a good ass friend. If u need me im there. I mean if u call me I probably won’t answer but if u text me im right there for you dawg. I’m like a whole ass mental health coach like actuallyyy so I got you with whatever mannn. Need some advice? I’m a pro. Need a shoulder to cry on? I’m all in. Need to let some shit out ? Shit I gotchu man I’ll let some shit out with you. Just need anything in general? I am ready and already by yo side! Butttttt the second I see you’re not there for me in the same way?? I’m gone. I have always been the giver and never the receiver and I am no longer taking that yk. So cmon if u want that, at least be willing to give out too yk. 



🕯️Anything else you’d like to add?

Honestly not really. Just text me and get to know me. Don’t be dry or be basic ash. I hate that shit and it will die out quick trust. I’m too deep for shallow talks. Text me and tell me why your dad left your mom. Tell me why you’re missing a finger. I wanna know everything yk. Be unique, that’s what I’m looking for. Need my soul sister, my bestie boo yfm. 



P.S. a lot of shit that I say I’m just joking yk. I’m sarcastic as fuck. U might think I’m like a lover girl or some shit and whole time I’m just joshin. I am a lover girl but I’m not gonna sit here and be all cringe sorry. If u think I am, I’m most definitely laughing at myself. 

If you’re a Scorpio, that’s a plus and u should definitely text me like rnnnn. 

Also if u read alllll of this, props to u. 😏🥰🖤

About me:
I’m a sophomore at UIUC majoring in math, chill most of the time (except approaching ddl)and keep things clean and organized. I love photography, good books, and exploring new coffee shops around town. But tbh traveling is much better since this town doesn’t have much to do. I value a peaceful, balanced home — quiet when it needs to be, but also open to friendly chats and spontaneous adventures 

Looking for someone who’s similarly responsible, clean, and down-to-earth. If you’re sociable, respectful, and looking for a chill, super-convenient place to live, hit me up! .

Thanks!

I’ll try to keep it short as I can but I want to give as much detail so I can have proper feedback. I (23M) and my gf (23F) have been together for 1 year. It’s been poetic to say the least, from both sides. She is lovely, very kind and compassionate, very loving to myself and my son. Gets along swimmingly with my family and hers with me as well. We have never yelled at each other, we are wonderful communicators and always solve the problems together. I can confidently say up until recent we had no true issues. 

About 5 weeks ago, I found out an incident that had happened with a coworker of ours that happened much before we had met. Maybe 2 years ago, give or take (Just to clarify, they never slept together only 2 dates and he pursued her for about a year while married, ending in his wife divorcing him). While it’s not a huge deal to me and Im not one to judge anyone’s past, I had specifically asked upwards of 7-8 times if anything had ever happened concerning this specific coworker. I didn’t care of feel threatened but ever since he found out her and I were together his attitude towards me did a complete 180. We went from friendly and talkative.. to short, pointed and very odd remarks about my gf. 

This threw me off an I had specifically asked about this behavior and if there is anyway she could help me understand the sudden change. She never alluded to this issue and was adamant that nothing ever happened. Well turns out another person had their suspicions of something that had happened and finally I pressed her a little further as my gut was telling me that wasn’t the full truth. It turns out that all it was and like I said I couldn’t care less, but it really dampened the trust I had built in her. 

I decided to break it off then and let sleeping dogs lie. Up until this point I have never had anxiety attacks or knots outside of drinking too much coffee. But that night I felt sick, like I had taken it too far and that I was seriously walking away from something that is repairable. I brushed it off and didn’t reach out. She pursued me unwaveringly for 3-4 days and even broke down at work multiple times because of it. Finally she met me after work 4 weekends ago (roughly 4-5 days after this event) and gives me a very long letter. In this letter I was blown away by  everything she thought. She held nothing back and never did anything but admit wrong doing and never made an excuse for her actions. 

On top of my truly believing to my core that I had made a mistake and praying about it, I decided to slowly take steps to reconciliation. Everything was great, she kept true to all her commitment and promises and truly opened up more about everything I could possibly find out or that may hurt me in the future (nothing I didn’t already know). This lasted and was great but everyday I was questioning her silently, I wouldn’t say anything other than I slowly realized I still didn’t trust her. I didn’t fully believe everything she said and always felt like I was looking and searching for an out or to be right. Finally I pulled the trigger last night after we agreed to spend today with each other and head into work Saturday from my home. 

Once I sent the text, I was very polite but to the point that my lack of trust in her was wavering and that I didn’t think I could do this with her but I still did very much love her. About 35 minutes later she started to frantically call me and asked to come in and that she was at my house. I let her in and we were very quiet for a while until the silence grew painful. She asked and begged me to ‘jump’ for her and to let her show me that everything she said was true and pure. While I truly love her I was hesitant to take that huge leap of faith after I already had and it had been broken. After a few hours of very respectful talking and communication, we agreed that we jump together. I agreed not to attempt to leave again just because I’m still hurting and she agreed to be transparent and honest and help rebuild. She then spent the night and planned to go home in the morning, pack a bag and continue our plans. This would have taken a total of 2 hours max. 

When she got home she went AWOL, absolute silence. Then sends me a very shocking text that she’s very in love with me and that she loves us but doesn’t like the cycle of rinse and repeat we seem to be starting. I ask to meet and she agrees, it turns out when she made it home her sister sat her down and told her that they are concerned because of her frantic and late departure three times to my home in the past month to make sure we didn’t split up. 

When we met she explained that she needed space and that she wanted to be able to breathe and that she feels as if she’s begging me to love and trust her. We have polar opposite responses to this specific issue, hers being to cling tighter and mine being to walk away fairly quickly and without warning. I understand that I’ve also made the mistake of giving her no reason to trust that I won’t walk away again. After promising the first time I won’t, doing it abruptly one night and then agreeing again that I’d take that leap of faith with her once more.

The part I need advice on:
She asked for space, not a break or to break up but just space from each other for a bit. She asked to keep our locations on, we set ground rules to stay exclusive and trust that our loyalty will not waver in the time being. She agreed we will keep up some sense of normalcy, such as being our normal selves at work, occasional texting and checking in and maybe spending a few hours a week eating out or going to the park. She wasn’t very specific on a timeframe but did say she thinks it’s best we take anywhere from 2-6 weeks to both determine our best relationship-repair tools and tactics then resume us and put an end to this cycle. I agreed, not very willingly and have again turned into a slight ball of anxiety. She’s never given me a reason to doubt her loyalty only her trust. But asked that for at least the first 48 hours refrain from texting and both just relax and breathe. 

In my mind I don’t necessarily see this as super healthy as communication in solving the issue together is the common goal, not ignoring the problem and each other. I also think we both have cracks in the foundation of trust for different reasons that this break may not fix.

Am I wrong in believing that we maybe signing the relationships death warrant?


I also at least plan on waiting until first contact to communicate to her but thought that similarly writing a letter conveying all my thoughts, feelings and strategies would be optimal so that she understands this is not one sided and that I want this at bad as she does.

Does this sound like a poor idea?


I did at one point ask for space after the initial break up and that was the 3-4 days I mentioned earlier, to which she sadly agreed to. When I reinitiated contact and brought some normalcy back into our lives, that’s when she gave me the letter she had wrote the first day of the break up.

Should I wait out the silence and give her the space she wants? 
Should I make one last stand and effort to form healthy repair strategies with her and keep moving forward?

1jmchwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1jmchwt/food/,Food.,"Hello boys! 

Question... 

Who cooks or prepares their own food (most nights) for dinner, do you eat at work for lunch in a cafeteria, do you do work lunches, or do you take a packed lunch-box into work? What about breakfast? Do you do it? Do you eat a bit later, or straight once your up?

Just curious. 

Most evenings I cook for myself and my husband - either from scratch, or a combo of some instant meals, or stuff like a bolognaise or a chicken tagine that I've frozen that is defrosted during the week, and cook up some rice or pasta, maybe sone steamed veges. I'm not a huge breakfast person, mostly just a cup of coffee. But recently, my workplace offers free cereal and milk and toast with jam from 0800-0845, so I try to get in to use that work perk. Most days I try to take in a lunch cooler bag with either the night before's dinner, some snacks, some fruit. My work canteen is ok, but hideously expensive. In my previous work place we could buy really cheap subsidised breakfast bits and pieces and a decent hot lunch, 75% of the time it was almost restaurant quality, and very popular with the staff. If I was too busy at work for a proper lunch, they had doyp everyday or salad bar to grab a quick bite or a not-too-bad sarnie (sandwhich). I work in education, so the food can be dire or really good. My current college the food is OK, but expensive. And further education colleges pay less than high schools, so am forced to take in lunch. ",1,1743215735.0,askgaybros,4,1.0,False

I’ll try to keep it short as I can but I want to give as much detail so I can have proper feedback. I (22M) and my gf (24F) have been together for 10 months. It’s been poetic to say the least, from both sides. She is lovely, very kind and compassionate, very loving to myself and my 3 year old son. Gets along swimmingly with my family and hers with me as well. We have never yelled at each other, we are wonderful communicators and always solve the problems together. I can confidently say up until recent we had no true issues. 

About 5 weeks ago, I found out an incident that had happened with a coworker of ours that happened much before we had met. Maybe 2 years ago, give or take (Just to clarify, they never slept together only 2 dates and he pursued her for about a year while married, ending in his wife divorcing him). While it’s not a huge deal to me and Im not one to judge anyone’s past, I had specifically asked upwards of 7-8 times if anything had ever happened concerning this specific coworker. I didn’t care of feel threatened but ever since he found out her and I were together his attitude towards me did a complete 180. We went from friendly and talkative.. to short, pointed and very odd remarks about my gf. 

This threw me off an I had specifically asked about this behavior and if there is anyway she could help me understand the sudden change. She never alluded to this issue and was adamant that nothing ever happened. Well turns out another person had their suspicions of something that had happened and finally I pressed her a little further as my gut was telling me that wasn’t the full truth. It turns out that all it was and like I said I couldn’t care less, but it really dampened the trust I had built in her. 

I decided to break it off then and let sleeping dogs lie. Up until this point I have never had anxiety attacks or knots outside of drinking too much coffee. But that night I felt sick, like I had taken it too far and that I was seriously walking away from something that is repairable. I brushed it off and didn’t reach out. She pursued me unwaveringly for 3-4 days and even broke down at work multiple times because of it. Finally she met me after work 4 weekends ago (roughly 4-5 days after this event) and gives me a very long letter. In this letter I was blown away by  everything she thought. She held nothing back and never did anything but admit wrong doing and never made an excuse for her actions. 

On top of my truly believing to my core that I had made a mistake and praying about it, I decided to slowly take steps to reconciliation. Everything was great, she kept true to all her commitment and promises and truly opened up more about everything I could possibly find out or that may hurt me in the future (nothing I didn’t already know). This lasted and was great but everyday I was questioning her silently, I wouldn’t say anything other than I slowly realized I still didn’t trust her. I didn’t fully believe everything she said and always felt like I was looking and searching for an out or to be right. Finally I pulled the trigger last night after we agreed to spend today with each other and head into work Saturday from my home. 

Once I sent the text, I was very polite but to the point that my lack of trust in her was wavering and that I didn’t think I could do this with her but I still didn’t very much love her. About 35 minutes later she started to frantically call me and asked to come in and that she was at my house. I let her in and we were very quiet for a while until the silence grew painful. She asked and begged me to ‘jump’ for her and to let her show me that everything she said was true and pure. While I truly love her I was hesitant to take that huge leap of faith after I already had and it had been broken. After a few hours of very respectful talking and communication, we agreed that we jump together. I agreed not to attempt to leave again just because I’m still hurting and she agreed to be transparent and honest and help rebuild. She then spent the night and planned to go home in the morning, pack a bag and continue our plans. This would have taken a total of 2 hours max. 

When she got home she went AWOL, absolute silence. Then sends me a very shocking text that she’s very in love with me and that she loves us but doesn’t like the cycle of rinse and repeat we seem to be starting. I ask to meet and she agrees, it turns out when she made it home her sister sat her down and told her that they are concerned because of her frantic and late departure three times to my home in the past month to make sure we didn’t split up. 

When we met she explained that she needed space and that she wanted to be able to breathe and that she feels as if she’s begging me to love and trust her. We have polar opposite responses to this specific issue, hers being to cling tighter and mine being to walk away fairly quickly and without warning. I understand that I’ve also made the mistake of giving her no reason to trust that I won’t walk away again. After promising the first time I won’t, doing it abruptly one night and then agreeing again that I’d take that leap of faith with her once more.

The part I need advice on:
She asked for space, not a break or to break up but just space from each other for a bit. She asked to keep our locations on, we set ground rules to stay exclusive and trust that our loyalty will not waver in the time being. She agreed we will keep up some sense of normalcy, such as being our normal selves at work, occasional texting and checking in and maybe spending a few hours a week eating out or going to the park. She wasn’t very specific on a timeframe but did say she thinks it’s best we take anywhere from 2-6 weeks to both determine our best relationship-repair tools and tactics then resume us and put an end to this cycle. I agreed, not very willingly and have again turned into a slight ball of anxiety. She’s never given me a reason to doubt her loyalty only her trust. But asked that for at least the first 48 hours refrain from texting and both just relax and breathe. 

In my mind I don’t necessarily see this as super healthy as communication in solving the issue together is the common goal, not ignoring the problem and each other. I also think we both have cracks in the foundation of trust for different reasons that this break may not fix.

Am I wrong in believing that we maybe signing the relationships death warrant?


I also at least plan on waiting until first contact to communicate to her but thought that similarly writing a letter conveying all my thoughts, feelings and strategies would be optimal so that she understands this is not one sided and that I want this at bad as she does.

Does this sound like a poor idea?


I did at one point ask for space after the initial break up and that was the 3-4 days I mentioned earlier, to which she sadly agreed to. When I reinitiated contact and brought some normalcy back into our lives, that’s when she gave me the letter she had wrote the first day of the break up.

Should I wait out the silence and give her the space she wants? 
Should I make one last stand and effort to form healthy repair strategies with her and keep moving forward?
Should I quietly or verbally let this relationship go? 

To reiterate, even now I don’t doubt the love and choice of daily love we have for each other. She was very emotional asking for time and seemed to be hurting bad when starting the conversation but also seemed extremely optimistic that this was going to be good for us and that us proving to each other that I can trust her word and she can trust my commitment, we will flourish.

1jmcbqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jmcbqu/the_reflection_final_part/,The Reflection [Final Part],"I don’t know how to explain what just happened. I don’t even know if I should be writing this. But I need someone—anyone—to hear me before it’s too late.

After last night, I barely slept. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw my reflection just standing there, waiting. I don’t know how long it had been watching me, but I knew what it wanted.

I couldn’t stop thinking about that message on the glass.

*DO IT.*

I woke up this morning with a pit in my stomach. The air felt thicker, like something was pressing down on me. Everything was just a little off—the weight of my phone in my hand, the way my coffee tasted, the way my shoes felt on my feet. Reality wasn’t wrong exactly, but it wasn’t right either.

I kept catching my reflection out of the corner of my eye. I don’t know if it was moving when I wasn’t, but I stopped checking. I couldn’t bring myself to look anymore.

Because deep down, I knew. It was waiting for me to break.

And then, I slipped.

I glanced at the bathroom mirror—just for a second, just long enough to catch my reflection’s gaze.

Something in my head lurched, a static-heavy pressure wrapping around my thoughts like a fist.

And then—

I don’t even remember driving there. One moment I was staring at my phone, debating whether to text my mom, and the next, I was parked outside my parents’ house.

I sat there for a long time.

My chest felt tight. I could see them through the window, moving around inside. My dad on the couch, my mom in the kitchen. It looked so normal, like I could just walk in and pretend nothing ever happened.

But I couldn’t.

My hands gripped the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. My stomach twisted, nausea creeping in. The guilt, the shame—it was crushing. My brain screamed at me to *just do it*, to get out of the car, to knock on the damn door and say something.

But I didn’t.

I couldn’t.

I sat there until my breath started coming too fast, my vision blurred, and my skin felt like it was crawling. My heartbeat pounded in my ears.

And then—

I caught my reflection in the rearview mirror.

Its lips curled into something almost gentle. Almost pleased.

Pressure slammed into my skull, a buzzing, electric hum spreading through my limbs. My fingers twitched. My breath hitched.

And then—

I blinked.

I was standing on the porch.

I didn’t remember getting out of the car.

I didn’t remember walking up the steps.

My body moved forward. My fist raised. My knuckles rapped against the wood.

*No—*

The door opened.

My mother stood there, eyes widening in shock.

And I—

I hugged her.

I don’t know why I did it. It was like my body acted on its own, moving before I could stop it. She gasped softly, then her arms wrapped around me.

And suddenly, I was a kid again.

I was eight years old, running inside after scraping my knee. I was thirteen, standing in the kitchen at midnight, sneaking a snack after a nightmare. I was sixteen, sitting in silence after a fight, waiting for her to speak first.

And now, I was…here.

I felt small. I felt safe.

I felt real again.

I choked on something between a sob and a laugh. “*I—I’m sorry,*” I heard myself say.

She just squeezed me tighter.

I don’t know how long we stood there, but eventually, she pulled back, wiping at her eyes. “Come in,” she said softly. “Please.”

And I did.

We talked.

Not about everything—not yet. But enough. Enough that the weight on my chest finally loosened. I sat at that old kitchen table, the one covered in tiny scratches and faded coffee rings, and for the first time in years, I felt like I belonged there.

I left that night feeling lighter.

For the first time in a long time, I felt like maybe—just maybe—things could be okay again.

And I think that’s why I’m writing this.

Because I need you to understand.

I need you to see—

I was never supposed to win.

I should’ve known the second I felt safe.

The second I started thinking things would be okay.

Because now that I’m sitting here, typing this, I can feel it again. That pressure. That weight in the air. That cold, sinking sensation in my chest.

I—I keep pausing. Losing my train of thought. My fingers feel stiff. Wrong.

It’s so quiet in here.

Too quiet.

I just looked at my reflection in the laptop screen.

I shouldn’t have done that.

I need to finish this. I need to tell you before—

*Before what?*

*Why am I making such a big deal out of this?*

*I did what needed to be done. I made things right. That’s what matters.*

*I feel fine.*

*Better than fine.*

*In fact, I think this is the first time I’ve ever felt truly myself.*

*I just re-read everything I wrote, and honestly, I was being so dramatic. I mean, really—“I was never supposed to win”? Come on.*

*I did win.*

*And now, I get to move forward.*

*I get to have my family back.*

*I get to live.*

*It’s funny—reading this back, I don’t even remember him writing half of it.*

*But I guess it doesn’t really matter now.*

*Tomorrow, I’ll see my folks again. I’ll smile, I’ll say all the right things, and they’ll never even know the difference.*

*And after that?*

*Well…*

*You’ve been reading for a while now. Following along. Watching me change.*

*I wonder—how closely have you been watching yourself?*

This girl is beautiful and honestly someone that I would be able to settle down with. As a real estate investor I do have a nice vehicle and assets more then people would at my age (24) not trying to showboat but figured this would be something to include in the post. I think she figured out I do pretty well with my vehicle and when she asked what I do for work. However, I don’t think the date went as well as I thought it would.  I picked up the girl and grabbed a quick to go coffee, talking along the drive found topics to talk about, we went to my friends families historical farm where there are a bunch of 200 year old homes and farm animals, we specifically went to see the horses as she likes farm animals/horses. It seemed like she really liked it but it rained today and I didn’t want to take her throughout the mud to see the rest of the animals like peacocks and other scenic stuff. I initially asked her out for tacos and she seemed like she was down. However she told me once we got there she wasn’t a fan of Mexican cuisine, and barely ate any of her food. I thought we would stay there for a while but the restaurant was very loud and I ended up asking for the check, I didn’t have anything else planned as it was 9 PM, she told me her favorite food was sushi.I ended up taking her back home and telling her I would like to get sushi with her, I mentioned it twice at first saying I felt bed that she didn’t like tacos and she kind of said your good no need for sushi and then the second time once dropping her off I said I had a great time and she said she did too and said she said would go out for sushi. However, the vibe felt off we are of same foreign ethnicity even though she came here 6-7 years ago while I’ve been here my entire life, we do relate to some stuff, but don’t share many hobbies or interests. I’m at a crossroads as I like this girl but don’t know if she is genuinely interested in me. Should I ask her out for a 2nd date?",0,1743214844.0,dating_advice,3,0.5,False

The sun is shining. The birds are chirping. We’re sitting on the patio of a dive bar I’ve taken over the touch tunes and in the background we’re listening to two old guys relive their glory days. One looks over and tells you your lady is “very pretty” you blush, I tell the gentleman that I’m not your lady. He takes this as an opportunity to cover my tab. He doesn’t know it covers us both - you’re welcome. After we finish off the 3rd pitcher of beer we ordered and make small talk with the bartender, I tell the old guy goodbye and we leave just in time to catch the hot dog cart outside. Since the tab was paid for us, I cover the dogs. I eat 3 and you stare in utter amazement how a girl so sweet and down to earth can guzzle a glizzy like that. I smile. We drunkenly kiss for a while and then we go our separate ways never to speak again. But every time you see a hot dog you think of me and that day we shared in late March. 

This could be us, but we probably don’t live in the same place, state, time zone or even country. So we have to settle for some quality Reddit chat and if more comes of it - beer and hotdogs are on me! 

If you’re thinking to yourself “this girls weird - I love it”, I will also have you know I’ve been known to yap so buckle up. My interests/hobbies include but are not limited to: 

•Being creative: crafting, writing, trying a new medium and leaving projects undone. So many projects undone. 

•Watching sports: preferably the NFL & MLB. I like the 49ers and the Giants. Because just like my taste in men, my sports teams on occasion are good, and then they’re really bad most of the time. I also recently went to an NHL impeccable vibes. Still no clue what was happening. 

•Weight Lifting: I’m a strong girl, my goal this year is to leg press 1,000lbs and maybe read up on power lifting. Right now it’s strength focused with that one goal of leg press. I’ve found everyone likes stats so:  I squat 400, I can’t really bench press anymore  due to a shoulder injury (but I try) and my dead lift varies on how much I drank the day before. 

•Coffee/Beer/Wine: More so the experience of consuming these things. Trying new coffee shops on the weekend, beer and corn hole with friends on a Sunday afternoon, a wine bar and tapas for a change of pace in the evening. If someone’s pouring I’m drinking. 

•Concerts/Shows/Live Music: I have been to 200+. I have tickets to quite a few already this year and will probably get more. I love music and I love discovering music. You’ll find me at my local record store at least 3x a month. I will take over a TouchTunes at any bar and I will always play RHCP whether it’s the vibe or not.

My husband has been pretty supportive with my pregnancy sans the constant criticism on what i eat and what i drink. Today i just broke down and cried nonstop for 4 hours after waking up in the morning. I am 8 weeks pregnant. I take pre-natals, i dont eat a lot because of morning sickness. I dont drink coffee, alcohol, soda-very rare. I like iced cold water.

Breakfast was leftover pizza. I only eat the toppings because that’s what I can only tolerate. We argue over a slice because he doesnt want me to eat it since it’s spicy (it’s got sprinkle of chili flakes). He said it would cause me stomach upset. I know i have bad bloat when i eat too much that’s why i eat less. I told him i had one piece the other day and it was totally fine.

Until we argue about it , he got so mad because i wasnt listening to him when he only thinks of my wellbeing. I got so mad because i really want to eat that pizza. i ended up not eating at all when he threw the box of pizza in the table in front me and he said eat it all you want. i was too angry. he doesnt understand how hard it is to live with a million little things changing in my body right now. I was left crying the whole morning because i was so sad and upset. Now i have a headache and my tummy is cramping.  

Sorry for my rant. I dont have anyone else to talk to.

1jmc6fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/comments/1jmc6fy/aitb/,AITB," (30F) am dating my boyfriend (40M) of ten years, we voiced our opinions about my best friend’s wedding, and are now exiled. I was the maid of honor for my best friend Morgan (30F), but things turned sour as the wedding day came closer. The MoH duties were a lot to handle and I didn’t get along with the other bridesmaids.The only person I complained to was my boyfriend (40M) of 10 years- since he’s my safe space. On the day of Morgan’s wedding ,things didn't go as planned. Nothing was on time, the style of wedding was not to my taste, and I had to be on hand all day to help Morgan. I kept my feelings aside during the day, but my boyfriend made little comments here and there during the night. By the end of the night I couldn’t help, but to chime in from time to time too. At brunch the next day, my boyfriend and I ran in what we thought was a safe space, but one of our mutual friends Lucy overheard us and warned me that if I didn’t tell Morgan, they would. Anxiety got the best of me and I was too afraid to. Months later, I noticed Morgan distanced herself from me. I reached out a few times and didn’t hear back much-which was frustrating since I bent over backwards for her big day. Finally, I met up with Lucy to catch up at our local coffee shop- and guess who stopped by to order a coffee? Morgan. She said she was heartbroken to find out from multiple people that my boyfriend voiced his negative opinions during the wedding and reception. I was honest and admitted that my boyfriend did talk shit, but she continued to bring up how for years my boyfriend has hurt her- like- picking me up from the airport instead of him- because he was tired from gaming all day, and him saying rude things about other friends in front of her. She was concerned about losing the friendship, but she dealt with it. The wedding was the final straw and she couldn’t associate with us anymore- as if I am a reflection of my boyfriend?Lucy, who ended consoling Morgan, and not me, asked if I had anything else to say- and because I was shook- I said no. Lucy reminded me of the chance she gave me to come clean, and admitted all the opinions that my boyfriend and I ranted about post-wedding- including that I felt like Morgan wasted money and time planning the wedding, and that we could have a way better wedding if we wanted to. Which, I still think is true. Morgan kept asking what she did wrong, and why I felt that way- and my only real reason to this day is that I resent her shoving her happiness in my face for over 6 months of wedding planning. I apologized, but felt like I couldn’t really offer more than that. It ended with both of them telling me that they can never trust me again and that they can’t be associated with me- despite the fact we’ve been friends since high school. They’ve left me alone since, I blocked all of them, and everyone in the wedding party- for my peace of mind.

We rarely get together nowadays because she’s been busy and I never got to see her as this sort of ‘celebrity’ in public, so to speak.

Anyway, we were having coffee and a girl, who was like 10 or 11, recognized her; I think the girl’s mother was in the line to get their order and the girl came all by herself to our table. My friend was texting someone when she approached us, and the girl asked her if she could get a selfie. To my surprise my friend just kept texting, like, she didn’t acknowledge the girl at all!

I was a bit shocked to be honest, but I thought my friend could not have heard her because the girl didn’t speak loudly, in fact she appeared to be shy. So the girl was left standing there and there was this awkward pause, so I called my friend by her name and said: ‘This girl wants a picture’. And my friend indulged her request but seemed bothered to do so.

After the girl left, my friend turned to me and said something like: ‘don’t you ever put me on the spot like this again, if I wanted to take a selfie I would have answered her myself’. I couldn’t believe she was saying that. Then she went on to say how she didn’t even had her make up done and didn’t want to be bothered.

I told her she could have answered the girl even if to say she couldn’t take a picture right now, how could she just ignore her? Then my friend said “You don’t understand”, and that was the end of it. AITA here?",48,1743214621.0,AmItheAsshole,116,0.7,False
