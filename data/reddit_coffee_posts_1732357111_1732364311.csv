Hey guys, sorry I don’t have a better picture use. I’m looking for a recommendation (Amazon links would be nice) on a reusable water bottle that can fit in the cup holder of the cab. I am an engineer for the LIRR and I only have this problem on our C3 Cab Car’s and our M3 and M7 multiple units. No issue with our DE/DM engines or our M9s. The cup holder in these two cabs is only wide enough to fit a standard soda can or a small cup of coffee you could buy from 7-Eleven or any convenience store. Even my slimmest YETI cup or my Adidas sports bottle does not fit in this cup holder because it’s too wide. I am not concerned about the quality of the insulation, because I don’t mind room temperature water. I just want something that can fit (again, no wider than a soda can) and will stay nice and sealed so it doesn’t leak in my bag.

","**A Future Written in Sunsets and Porch Swing Stories**

Imagine this: it’s the summer of 2054. We’re on the porch of a cozy house—one of those timeless places where the steps creak like old memories and the swing hums softly in the evening breeze. The sky is a canvas of gold and fire, and we’re there, painting it with laughter and shared stories. The kind of tales that weave themselves into your soul: travels that shaped us, mishaps that made us laugh, and quiet moments where no words were needed—just the warmth of each other’s company.

It’s not about grand adventures every day, but about finding magic in the ordinary—the way the sunset turns the edges of the world golden or how a shared silence can feel louder than words. Now, I’m here searching for the co-author of this future. Could it be you?

# A Little About Me

I’m a contradiction wrapped in curiosity. A writer of thoughts, a collector of sunsets, and a seeker of those fleeting moments that remind us how beautiful the world can be. Quiet at first, but if you’re patient, you’ll find someone who speaks in passions and listens like it’s the most important thing they could ever do.

Right now, I’m looking for **a friendship** that feels like the first chapter of a well-worn book—something natural, unforced, where we build a connection page by page. I believe the best stories begin with a spark of understanding, and maybe, just maybe, they grow into something more.

**Here’s what makes my story unique:**

🎵 **Music as a Muse:** Vinyl collections, road trip playlists, and songs that feel like home. Music has a way of connecting moments, and I love finding the soundtrack to life’s best memories. Got a favorite tune? Share it—I’m always ready to discover the melodies that move you.  
🌍 **Adventure in My Veins:** Whether it’s chasing the perfect golden-hour light, wandering through unfamiliar streets, or hiking trails that lead to breathtaking views, I’m all about exploring the world—both near and far. Life’s too short not to follow the whispers of adventure.  
📚 **Wordsmith at Heart:** Writing is my way of capturing the fleeting and the unforgettable. I love playing with words until they reflect the emotions I can’t quite say aloud. And recently, I’ve been dabbling in photography—turning moments into memories through a lens.  
🕹️ **Low-Key Gamer:** When the world feels too loud, there’s something comforting about a quiet night in with a good game or a classic movie marathon.

# What Sets Me Apart

I see life as a tapestry of little details: the way sunlight dances on leaves, the rhythm of rain on a quiet afternoon, or the poetry of a shared moment that feels too good to end. I’ll notice the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love, and I’ll make a mental note of your favorite coffee order—not because I have to, but because I want to.

Loyalty is my cornerstone. I’ll show up, not just in the big moments, but in the small ones too—the random text when I know you’re having a rough day, the laughter when you need a distraction, or simply being there when you feel like the world isn’t. The best stories aren’t about grand gestures; they’re about the quiet consistency of someone who’s truly there for you.

I’m also a romantic—not in the cliché way, but in the way that makes you feel seen. Sweet gestures, thoughtful words, and a knack for making everyday moments feel special. I’m the kind of person who’ll leave you a note in your favorite book, point out constellations during a midnight drive, or turn a casual Sunday into something unforgettable.

And when it comes to connection, I value honesty above all. If something’s on your mind, I’ll always want to hear it. Because real stories—the ones worth telling—are built on truth, not games.

# What About You?

Are you the kind of person who finds beauty in the cracks of everyday life? Who laughs easily, dreams deeply, and values honesty like a rare gem? Maybe you’re someone who savors both the quiet moments and the spontaneous ones—a cozy evening in or a bold adventure out.

Let’s start as friends, as kindred spirits who share an appreciation for the world’s quirks and wonders. Maybe we’ll swap stories, exchange playlists, or even embark on an adventure or two. And if the story decides to write itself into something more, we’ll let it—after all, the best tales often begin with an unexpected chapter.

If this resonates, let’s start the first line of what could be an unforgettable story. One filled with porch swings, golden sunsets, and the kind of connection that makes you believe in the magic of “what if.” Let’s see where the words take us.",2,1732363846.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1gxy7z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/JeffBuckley/comments/1gxy7z4/jeff_buckley_is_a_vocal_prodigy/,Jeff Buckley is a Vocal Prodigy,"Now as much as the title is obvious to anyone who is a big enough fan of him to float on a subreddit about him. I think people don’t truly grasp how insane his vocal transformation was. He went from a slightly above average vocalist to one of the best in 3 years.

Anyone who knows his story knows he was for a long time mainly a person who played in bands and never sung and his proficiency of his guitar was a big part from the fact he played in so many different genres. Anyone who plays guitar knows that his guitar work is incredibly underrated and Grace has a lot of progressive rock elements thanks to Gary Lucas (Alumni of Captain Beefheart). However his vocal transformation was insane. If we go back to the recording his cover of “I Never Asked to be Your Mountain” his vocals were decent with a few high points but anyone who sings can see there were flaws in his technique. His tone was honestly carrying him in that performance. And again not to downplay the high points of the performance the sweet lover although is vibrato was quite inconsistent and abrupt when he lands he ended up sounding good. At around 4:54 sounds really good. But again his vocal and his dynamics needed serious work. 

Originally I chalked this up to the fact it was a bootleg recording from the quality of sound, the guitar sometimes was way too loud and his voice got buried, my suspicions were confirmed when you hear his work with Gary Lucas on “Songs to No One” recorded around 91-92 now I consulted my girlfriend who was a singer and dancer and a child performer on TV, since she has sung on a semi professional level I had asked for her input. And she noticed it too if you listen to “She Is Free” the same issues arise, his pronunciation isn’t nearly as strong, and the same issues with consistency and dynamics arise, at least to my ears there are certain parts that are louder and some parts more quiet, his voice sounded like what it was someone with a nice tone but was nervous due to his lack of experience being the singer and not just the guitarist. I want to stress it isn’t a bad performance but this was clearly a very early recording with him and Lucas if you even listen to Grace (studio demo) his vibrato isn’t nearly as present, vibrato which is a sign of good vocal technique and is plentiful during his Sine-E and Grace period. And while he has a bit more confidence in him self he’s still not all the way there.

Now if you’ve reached this point, you’re probably thinking if I am even a fan. But here’s where the true virtuosity comes in. So as established from 91-92 he’s not a particularly incredible singer, he’s at the level at least to me where if I heard in a coffee shop I wouldn’t wish it was over and I could enjoy the performance. But again I’m not getting chills from songs like “She is Free.” Now he’s recording his Sine-E performances for his label. After performing for a couple of years. Keep in mind the Gary Lucas tapes were from August 1991-April 1992, the Sine-E performances were from July-August 93. Now I don’t know what Angel came down to him and touched his vocal cords but the change from a year and a few months is fucking remarkable and even typing this that feels like an understatement, I sadly lack the articulation skills to express how much of an enigma he was. Apparently he was purely self taught with a little bit of teaching from his mother when they would harmonise in his early childhood, she was classically trained. Perhaps the genetics from his dad helps since he was also a vocal prodigy if you have not heard his stuff, whether the Sex Funk or the avant garde or the folk psychedelic music eras he made. It becomes very apparent that genetics definitely helped. 

However at this point his dynamics are a lot better, his consistency in volume and tone has really evened out, his vibrato is a lot more consistent which is a traditional marker of good technique. He’s truly come into himself. Then nearly a year later he releases Grace, and I don’t really need to give you my analysis on that, his vocal work was inspiring enough that you’re currently on this subreddit. So in the span of 3 years he went from nervous untrained slightly above average vocalist to one of the best vocalists in American Music. 3 years. Truly incredible. 

I say this to mark the enigmatic trajectory of his vocal transformation but also to remind you that sometimes to become a great or exceptional requires time and work as well as the fact that you’re often you’re a lot closer to where you want to be than you think and a lot of the gaps between you and someone like Jeff are mental. Now obviously I’m not saying you’re going to become the best in 3 years but you can get pretty damn good.  
Keep in mind he also started his singing career comparatively late he was 24 when he made his “vocal debut.” Although he did do some background work. When he decided to sing he was in his Mid 20s.

Hope you enjoyed reading!

My 6 years old D5 pump stops running after a few hours of operation seemingly randome. When i restart the PC, it works again. 

I run a (360mm x 45mm), (360mm x 30mm) a (240mm x 22mm) together with a tube Pump reservoir combo, a CPU block from corsair, and a 4080Super waterblock. All my parts are from alphacool.

Flowrate at around 75% is 87L/h and my watertemp is at 29c to 38c (still have to adjust fancurve a bit to keep it a little lower).

Also it makes this humming noise, not very loud but noticable. louder then my 17 fans combined. no all tose fans are very quiet (30% speed) (40db)

It is a new build 2 weeks old with some parts from my old build like the pump. As far as i can tell this is only happend twice. once during gaming but in menu. (i just got to menu to get coffee then i looked to the aquacomputer display to see how the flowrate drops to 0L/h)

the other time was when i downloaded 150 GB over night and in the morning it was not working. CPU temp max was 68C, at the time i got to the PC it was at 50C. (HWiNFO running in background)

  
so this is all i have about info. If somone needs more info to help me i am happy to provide all i can.

I think it's at a point where I can't justify a reason to be alive anymore or keep fighting. I lost my dream job over a year ago, basically got played by a major company, put my heart and soul into that job and was fired despite never even having any problems prior. I tried to find hope in God, converted to Islam, thought things were looking up when I was deep in the faith and working at a place that seemed to be a good opportunity. Now my life is so different and a lot of stuff has come to light that only makes me feel more depressed. Basically all the people that I used to help when I had the cash and the ability basically ignore me. They know I am depressed and jobless, sending out applications with nothing really happening in my favor. They don't check in on me, they don't offer support in any way. So months ago, I stopped posting about my struggles, didn't bother to even try and keep contact with anyone, deleted a lot of my social media without warning and virtually stopped going outside unless I absolutely have to. I don't see the point. I'm going to get treated like shit anyway. Gonna be judged or treated like a burden anyway. This feeling was reinforced with distant family as well. They know I don't have a car, but I've ridden a bus for hours to go visit them and every time they come to the city, they don't tell me or try to reach out so we can hang out, they come, go do some fun stuff without me and then posts pictures on their socials of how much fun they had....they were the first to be cut off. I don't date, try to make new friends and avoid social contact as much as possible cus it always ends the same. The person only wants to connect with me to use or hurt me and doesn't actually value me as person. Now i'm starting not to see the point of eating. At times avoiding it all together and not feeling any passion for food despite having spent 13 years in food service. It's just too much. I feel like a burden on my family because I don't have a job and I feel so alone. I gave up the hope of having my own family and children years ago. I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel.

So, I've started prepping for the end. I've convinced my roomie I want to learn how to shoot because I am worried about my safety and part of me is, with being female and everything going on. But the real reason is I just want access to a gun so I can finally unalive myself. I've tried other ways many times and I am sure this is the quickest and more full proof way then pills. I was considering jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge since that sounds so poetic, but they have that pesky suicide netting up. So maybe that will be my last day. I've never actually walked across the bridge despite having lived near it my whole life. Maybe a walk across the bridge, catch the bus to Sausalito after, have a coffee and a pastry at my favorite cafe and then walk all the way down to the house boats or maybe take a taxi to Rodeo Beach. I was thinking maybe going into the water and doing it there, so my body gets washed away and breaks down quickly so my mom doesn't have to identify a body. That's the only hesitation I have,  I don't want to upset my mom and sister but I also think they will be better off without the burden of dealing with me. I already know people will either scroll past this or ignore it, it's the most unhinged thing I have ever written.

1gxxzur,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeVPNs/comments/1gxxzur/best_free_vpn/,Best Free VPN,"A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is like a secure tunnel for your internet traffic. It hides your real IP address, encrypts your data, and can even spoof your location. This makes it harder for advertisers, ISPs, or hackers to track you. Sounds great, right? But let’s be real—not everyone needs a VPN all the time. Most U.S. internet traffic is already encrypted through HTTPS, so your ISP or the coffee shop Wi-Fi owner can only see the websites you visit, not what you do on them. For most people, VPNs are situational tools, not everyday necessities.

# When Does a VPN Make Sense?

VPNs are a good idea in specific scenarios. If you’re traveling to a country with less secure internet, want to keep your ISP from snooping, or are dealing with censorship, a VPN can be invaluable. They’re also helpful for journalists, activists, or anyone looking to protect sensitive data.

But here’s the catch: most VPNs cost money, averaging about $10 a month. Free VPNs exist, but they have a bad reputation. Many log your data or serve you ads, which defeats the purpose. Still, a few good free options can get the job done without compromising your security.

# What Makes a Good Free VPN?

For a free VPN to make the cut, it should:

* Be completely free - no sneaky trials or credit card requirements.
* Offer essential VPN functions like data encryption and IP masking.
* Avoid shady practices like logging user data or selling it, obviously.
* Have reasonable performance, even if it comes with limits like fewer servers or slower speeds.

# The Best Free VPN: (Probably) Proton VPN

Proton VPN stands out because it doesn’t limit your data usage (a rarity for free VPNs). It offers servers in five countries: the U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, and Romania. This isn’t great for spoofing your location to access streaming content, but for general privacy and security, it’s more than enough.

Proton VPN has an excellent reputation for privacy, with a no-logs policy backed by third-party audits. They’ve even published transparency reports detailing their interactions with law enforcement. While the free version limits you to one device at a time and lacks some advanced features like multi-hop connections, these restrictions are easy to live with.

Some other options that are worth a look:

* **TunnelBear**: User-friendly and secure, but the free version limits you to just 2 GB of data per month.
* **Windscribe**: Offers 2 GB of monthly data (or 10 GB if you provide your email), but could use more transparency.
* **Hide.me**: No data cap, but fewer server options and a shorter track record than Proton VPN.
* **Opera VPN**: Built into the Opera browser with unlimited data, but it only protects your browser traffic.

# The Takeaway

VPNs can be useful, but they’re not a one-stop solution for online security. Start with basics like strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and tracker blockers. For occasional VPN needs, Proton VPN is your best bet among the free options. Just don’t expect a free VPN to work as smoothly or flexibly as a paid one.

1gxxy51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dresdenfiles/comments/1gxxy51/be/,"""Be""","Towards the end of Ghost Story, Harry raises his hand and snarls, ""Forzare!"" to Evil Bob, knocking Bob back a bit. It is stated that many wizards use languages to cast spells that are less than fluent in to insulate their minds from the magic they are channeling (and other possible reasons). No doubt Dresden fell back to his usual habits as a ghost, but when he had no other option left, he decided this:

""Then I did something fairly nutty, as I gathered the memory for what I was to attempt. I just uttered the spell in plain, old English. The energy seared through my thoughts in a way that would have been damaging to a living wizard, maybe fatal. It seemed appropriate to use it here, and I released whatever power I had left, clothing it in garments of memory, as I murmured the most basic of ideas, the foundation of words and of reality.""  
“Be.”  
In Cold Days, when he meets with Odin, the conversation goes like this:  
“Well, well, well,” he said. “Rumors of your death, et cetera.”  
I shrugged. “I’m sure it isn’t an uncommon play among wizards,” I said.  
Something in his eye flashed, an amused thought that went by almost before I could see it.  
“Fewer try it than you might think,” he said.  
“I didn’t try anything,” I said. “It just happened.”  
Vadderung reached out and lazily collected a cup of coffee. He sipped it, watching me. Then he  
leaned forward slightly and said slowly, “Nothing that significant just happens, Dresden.”

Odin has an interesting perspective on the matter; while he didn't die, he did sacrifice himself on Yggdrasil for the sake of gaining knowledge.

Harry says in the first book that his greatest magical talent is thaumaturgy. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines thaumaturgy as ""the performance of miracles."" I think we can all think of a few miracles performed by Dresden.

Finally, in the second quote, he says, ""The energy seared through my thoughts in a way that would have been damaging to a living wizard, maybe fatal."" So if Mab and Demonreach and the parasite were keeping him alive, then he was alive when he willed himself into existence. If Mab and Demonreach and the parasite just barely managed to keep his physical body alive, but had no effect whatsoever upon anchoring his soul to his body, then Dresden forced himself into existence; not where Mab or Demonreach wanted him to be, but where he was needed to save his friends and humanity from the Corpsetaker. And if Mab and Demonreach were just keeping his body alive while his spirit floated about the living world, the afterlife, he was probably just flat out dead.

So I guess I'm saying that the natural rules that Mab and Odin and many other ancient powers seem to know and follow were shattered by a two-letter word.

“Well me and (her husband) are so young, we know we can have this second one and they’ll be out of the house by the time we’re 50 and we get our life back. I can’t imagine being 50 and only having kids in middle / primary school. You’ll have no energy.”

Hi, 

I’m 34M from Britain (England). I’m open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain (I am based in the East Midlands), as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 


If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and connect.

I'm looking for fellow people **based in the UK** (willing to adopt Irish people too) to talk to on this fine but very rainy morning.

**What I'm getting out of this:**

* Conversation practice - I'm rusty with the socialization as a grad student!
* Potentially an actual friend (If you live within traveling distance, even better). I'm in west mids.
* A personal UK expert - I can ask you questions like is the meal deal in some places pure robbery
* Someone to discuss film with (especially horror) would be cool. I love discovering true crime cases from someone

**What you get out of it:**

* Tons of funny stories, life has been a massive fail for me recently
* Film (horror) recommendations
* A person to go to new places with (coffee and museum is my perfect day out)
* Any cultural nuisance you don't understand, I'm your girl (Middle eastern)

Ps: please don't reply with just 'hi', add a sentence or two. It helps conversation flow better. If you seek sex, you won't end up getting it from me, sorry.",0,1732361615.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,0.5,False

I realise these are the easiest aisles I could get but I feel like I am working hard and it's not always possible for me to go faster - for example they say 1 cage should take an hour, but that makes no sense to me since there can be loads of small boxes inside of it that I have to break down 
My question is - how many aisles do you usually do and what are they? Is being put on the same place every single shift bad? Am I just there because they are understaffed? 

If I'm really doing that bad if so how can I tell? I'm planning on asking them how I can improve as I really do want to keep this job after christmas

>[$30](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/?f=flair_name%3A%22%2430%22)

>So I've always liked the 5 Gift Christmas rule (something they want, something they need, something to do, something to read, and something to wear) and have been keeping it in mind while shopping for my boyfriend this year. I'm really stumped about ""something to read"" though, because my boyfriend doesn't read as a hobby and I don't think he'd actually use a reading related gift. Does anyone have their own substitution for this category?

>EDIT: Thank you all for your suggestions, I got inspiration from a few of the suggestions and came up with something simple that I know he'll like. We play board games, but I didn't want to get him a game because it's honestly more of my hobby than his even though he likes playing. But, he loves winning so I am going to frame the scorecard from the first time he beat me at a game I usually win. Not quite reading but I'm happy with it and that's what matters!

That’s such a thoughtful idea! Framing a scorecard from a game he won is a creative and meaningful way to capture a memory. If you're looking for additional or alternative substitutions for the ""something to read"" category, here are some ideas that tie into his interests but don’t necessarily require traditional reading:

# Substitutions for ""Something to Read""

1. **Framed or Personalized Memorabilia**
   * Frame a meaningful ticket stub, map, or even a short, handwritten letter or quote that resonates with a shared experience.
2. **A Custom Puzzle with a Special Photo**
   * Design a jigsaw puzzle with an image of you two, a funny inside joke, or a memorable location.
   * [Custom Puzzle](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=custom+photo+puzzle&tag=gifts-favspro-20)
3. **Visual “Reading” Gifts**
   * A coffee table book with stunning photos of his hobbies (travel, cars, sports). These are more for browsing than reading.
   * [Travel Coffee Table Book](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=travel+coffee+table+book&tag=gifts-favspro-20)
4. **Custom Deck of Cards**
   * A personalized deck of playing cards with photos or messages on them. These tie into both games and sentimental value.
   * [Custom Playing Cards](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=custom+photo+playing+cards&tag=gifts-favspro-20)
5. **Something to Watch**
   * Swap ""read"" for something he can watch, like a Blu-ray or digital copy of a movie he loves. If he’s into anime, gift an iconic series or film.
   * [Blu-ray Gift Ideas](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=blu+ray+movies&tag=gifts-favspro-20)
6. **Map or Poster of a Favorite Place**
   * A map of his favorite travel destination, a star chart from a special date, or an art print from a show he loves.
   * [Custom Star Map](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=custom+star+map&tag=gifts-favspro-20)
7. **Audio Content**
   * If he’s not into books, consider an Audible subscription or gifting him an audiobook of something he’d enjoy (memoir, sports story, or comedy).
   * [Audible Gift Membership](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=audible+gift&tag=gifts-favspro-20)
8. **A Shared Activity**
   * Replace “reading” with a ticket or invitation to do something you can both enjoy together, like a cooking class, escape room, or game night at a local bar.
9. **Personalized Calendar**
   * Create a photo calendar with funny or sentimental images from the past year.
   * [Custom Photo Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=custom+photo+calendar&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# Personalized Ideas Similar to the Scorecard

* **Custom Game Board Piece**
   * If you play board games, get him a personalized game token or dice.
   * [Custom Dice](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=custom+dice&tag=gifts-favspro-20)
* **Mini Trophy or Medal**
   * Engrave a small trophy with “Winner of \[Your Name\]'s Heart” or something funny about his game win.
* **DIY Memory Keepsake Box**
   * Fill it with other special mementos, like photos, small trinkets, or notes from your relationship.

I’m weaning off of it and need advice for natural weight loss.,"Hi! For context: I had an IUD for 2 years and really noticed PCOS symptoms arise during the time. I had the IUD (weight gain, hirsutism, low energy). In the spring of 2023, I weighed about 215 lbs. I decided to try to make healthier changes - I started intermittent fasting and going to Crossfit. I started seeing a functional medicine NP and she recommended using inositol and taking vitamin D and B12. I did that for a few months and felt a little more energetic but my weight didn’t budge. I decided to get my IUD out in July 2023. I had fairly regular periods after taking out the IUD. I started working night shift in August 2023 and started losing a little weight naturally because my appetite was shit, but I didn’t have the energy to do literally anything besides sleep, eat, and work. Fast forward to 2024, I lost about 10 pounds total. In March of this year, I decided to give semaglutide a try because I wanted to lose a few more pounds before getting married later in the year. Between March and July, I went from 205 to about 180 lbs. Then, I hit a plateau. 

I decided to get off night shift and mannn do I feel so much better!!! I’m getting quality sleep every night and feel like I have energy to do things before and after work. I quit CrossFit but started going to hot yoga a few times a week. On top of that, I try to walk for at least 20 minutes a few times a week. I haven’t done strict keto but have been implementing keto recipes into my everyday meals to get more vegetable intake in and watch my carb intake. Most days I do IF out of convenience but have a cup of black coffee in the morning. My periods have been somewhat regular but my cycle frequency has had some variation from time to time (i.e. 10/12 months my cycles are 27-30 days, 2/10 months they’re 35 or 36.) I’ve gained a few pounds back (I’m about 185 lbs now) because I actually have an appetite from the switch to day shift. 

I’m weaning off of the semaglutide because 1. I’ve been at this plateau for months now, 2. it’s fucking expensive, and 3. it’s not realistic for me personally to rely on meds forever to lose weight. I want to lose a bit more and I’m nervous about regaining all the weight I did lose. I also still have the chin hair which has definitely gotten worse over the last year.

Dr. Joshua Davidson walked into the local coffee shop. He had just returned a week ago from the Amazon, setting up free clinics for local tribes. He was still trying to acclimate himself into New York society. Decompressing from 3rd world countries seemed to get more difficult for him as he got older. He had a few more days off before going back on shift. He had been seriously thinking about no longer participating in DWB (Doctors Without Borders) and trying maybe to start a normal life. He wasn't getting any younger and he felt his own biological ticker sounding a now or never warning.

He ordered a coffee and went to sit down when he saw her at a table looking out the window. The most amazing woman he had ever known, and quite possible would ever know.

Kate Beckett, more beautiful than when he was with her over 11 years ago. He hesitated to say hi. Their breakup had been loud and angry. he still could recall all of it to this day, but it's been 11 years, so he decided to man up.

""Kate"", Josh said, Kate looked up from her musings and looked surprised if not a little apprehensive when she saw him.

""Josh... uhm how are you doing""?

""Mind if I sit down Kate or are you waiting from someone""?

""No... well actually yes, my husband will be here in about 30 minutes, but you can sit down till he arrives if you want"". Josh sat down and looked at her.

""I have to say Kate you look more beautiful than ever"".

""Thats sweet of you to say that, but I find the occasional gray hairs now, and I have to fight a few more wrinkles"".

Josh laughed, ""I don't know what to say, you just radiate happiness, and it looks good on you"". Josh notices that she blushes. Kate Beckett never blushed. This woman is someone he barely recognizes. He hears her phone ring.

""Sorry Josh I need to take this"". Josh hears the one end of the conversation and is again amazed at this new version of Kate Beckett.

""No, you big Baby"", he heard her say. ""It's your own fault for letting her Rangle you into another game. She has you wrapped around her finger Babe.  Yes, I know she has mad ninja skills but she's 4 and a half years old, now go and find her. Shes probably hiding in the laundry basket again"".  Josh is stunned by the conversation; he watches as Kate starts laughing, ""No Babe I don't think she minds the smell of our dirty underwear. Now go find our daughter you big ass and get down here. Okay, see you soon"". Josh watches as she has such a big smile on her face. ""Love you more... now hurry up"".

Kate looks at Josh shyly, ""Sorry about that, my husband and daughter have gotten into some mischief"".

Josh smiled and said, ""I didn't even think you were married when I first sat down. I didn't see a ring"".

Kate thought to herself, ""Dammit no wonder he sat down"". Kate was trying to leave Castles name out of the conversation, because even though it has been over 11 years, their fight when she broke it off was mostly about him, and she doesn't want to deal with any left-over animosity.

Kate says, ""Thats because when I go out into the field I put it on my necklace, with my mother's ring. Kate then proceeds to remove her ring from her necklace and place it back on her finger.

Josh exclaims, ""Wow that's one a hell of a ring, must have been expensive"".

Kate not really comfortable talking about it said, ""My husband had it specially made so that it was beautiful but would still be practical in the field. I was still a detective when we got married so he had it designed so that I could still put on my latex gloves at the crime scene without ripping thru them. I don't go out in the field as much as I used to now that I'm a Captain. I can wear my ring on my finger, plus being a Captain has allowed me to be safer and spend more time with my family. So, tell me Josh what's up with you.  Still doing DWB""?

xxxxx

While Kate had been talking Josh started to think back when they first met. She was the one he had unfortunately compared all other women too. Listening to this Kate, floored him. Spend more time with her family? Be Safer? Those words would have never come from her mouth back then. His Kate was single minded in her pursuit of justice, and nothing, and no one was ever going to get in her way. This Kate was everything that his Kate wasn't. His Kate never laughed like that. His Kate never sounded so happy and in love. He never knew she even had the capacity for it, because his Kate had been guarded, and aloof, and career driven, and so fiercely independent that he never saw a future with her as married or with kids, though he still thought that she was everything that he had ever wanted and hoped that she would come around eventually.

Plus, if he was being honest with himself, even though it had been 11-12 years ago, he has always held each woman up in comparison to her. The most complex, beautiful, stubborn, sexy, woman he had ever met. Kate Beckett.

He had met her at a motorcycle parts store. She had been guarded when he had approached her, but a coffee with her here, a dinner there, a motorcycle ride on a weekend, finally led them into bed after a month. Eventually they formed a relationship. They had exchanged keys, and everything was right with the world for the first 3 months. Then her tag along, shadow, partner, whatever she was calling him came back into her life. At first, he noticed that she really didn't talk about him much, and seemed happy in his arms, but that started to change the more time that Kate spent with him. Josh had asked her if their partnership was more than friends, but she always laughed it off and said, ""No... Just friends"".

She still came back to him, she still went into his bed, but as months passed, he started to notice more and more that she was not really there in the moment with him.  She asked him not to go to Haiti, and he had stayed. She was happy and let him believe that they could make a go of it, but that euphoria lasted only a couple of weeks and then everything started to slide backwards again. Sex seemed strained, almost like effort. She started to smile and laugh more and more, about the silly things that the writer had done and said that day. It became an issue with them as time went on. Arguments, where she denied that they were nothing more than partners, and that it was his bed she came home to, but he knew she was in his bed, but elsewhere in her head.

When he had found out that she had gone to L.A., and Castle had gone with her, they had a major fight. They didn't break up then, but things had started to slide even more from there. He always felt that they could right the ship somehow, but after her shooting, she said she was going to her dad's cabin, and she was going alone. She had also heard about him shoving her partner and was furious with him. He accused her of cheating on him with the writer, and she yelled that being with him had been one of her biggest mistakes of her life. When he heard that he just screamed at her and left.

Kate repeated herself ""Josh did you hear me, what's going on with DWB""?

""Sorry...sorry Kate my mind is still trying to catch up with seeing you again.  I just got back from the Amazon a couple of weeks ago, and it funny you ask me now, because I was just thinking when I came in here that I'm considering quitting DWB and just work in the city either at the hospital or open up my own practice"".

""Really, I never thought I'd hear you say that"", Kate replied. ""It was always your prime focus above all other things"".

Josh sighed knowing that was some sort of dig, ""Yeah, well therein lies the problem. I want a family and a wife, or some sort of lasting relationship before I get too old. Consider it a form of male menopause. I want more out of life, kind of like what you're doing now. I've sacrificed enough relationships, at the behest of DWB. I need to think of myself for once"".

Kate smiled, ""I know the feeling. Luckily, I came to my senses years ago. I didn't want to have ""*If Only*"", I had done this or that. My husband and my daughter are my life, and I'm so glad that I found the right man, to make that journey with"".

He knew that Kate wasn't making a dig at him, just talking, but it hurt anyway.

Kate trying to get him out before Castle showed up said, ""Well I know you're a wonderful and caring man, and you will make someone a great husband and father. Just remember to prioritize them first above all things"".

""Is that what happened to us Kate""?

""Josh, my husband will be here shortly, he might not understand my sitting with another man, and no to your question. I wasn't necessarily a good person when I was with you. I was dark back then and dealing with conflicting emotions over so many things. It was never going to work, but that doesn't mean we didn't have some good times, so let's just leave it as two people that drifted together and a part over the course of their lives."".

Josh got up from the table and looked down for maybe the last time at the most beautiful and amazing woman he has ever met. ""I'm happy that you found love, and I hope you have a wonderful life, Kate. You deserve it"".

Kate smiled and said, ""To you as well Josh. I wish only the best for you...Goodbye"".

Josh thought to himself as he was leaving, ""Well at least she didn't marry the fucking writer"".

As Josh pushed the door open of the restaurant and walked outside, he bumped into a man wearing sunglasses who was trying to enter. He heard the man say, ""Sorry sir"", and he recognized the voice. ""Castle""?

Rick looked up at the man he ran into and said ""Davidson""?

xxxxxxx

Josh looked at Castle and felt the old anger creeping back. He knew it had been over 11 years, and he knew better than to keep holding grudges, but this man brought out the worst in him for what could have been. Without even thinking he blurted out, ""What are you doing here""?

Castle smirked, knowing that he probably saw Kate, ""Oh, I'm sorry. I came here to eat and be with my wife, what's your excuse""?

Josh realizing that he already knows the answer asks anyway, ""Are you telling me your married to Kate""?

Castle laughed, ""Of course I married Kate. It was always going to be Kate. Other than my family, she was my first priority in all things. Everything else was secondary, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart, for making your job your number one priority. I see no ring on your finger, so I won't ask how that's all working out for you, still saving people I see. Very noble of you. I have to go now; the love of my life is waiting for me. Bye Bye"", and with that Castle waved his fingers as he walked thru the restaurant's door. He swore as the door closed; that he heard partly ""... you"". Castle smiled and figured what the first part of that sentence was. ""Revenge is a dish best served up cold"", he thought. Then he asked himself why he was reciting a scene from ""The Wraith of Kahn"".

As Josh stormed off, he chided himself for losing control and holding an 11-year-old grudge. He was better than that. He was also angry at himself because that asshole was right. Kate was never his first priority, and in retrospect he hates himself for that, even though he saved lives, he was not the only doctor in the world. Like it or not this was going to be the kick start he needed. No more DWB. He was going to live his life and pray that he would find someone like Kate. He hoped that that would still be possible.

Castle walked over and gave his wife a big kiss. ""Hi honey, hope I didn't keep you waiting. Kate seemed unaware of the fact that he bumped into Josh. Castle sat down and picked up the menu and held it in front of his face and started to ramble, ""I know its afternoon, but I want pancakes. Do you think they have afternoon pancakes Kate, if not they should. Pancakes should be 24/7 type of meal, don't you think""?

Kate laughing to herself but concerned as to why her husband wouldn't put his menu down, and was still wearing his sunglasses said, ""Babe, put the menu down and let me see your baby blues"".

Castle replied, ""I'm comfortable this was honey, plus I'm still perusing the pancake choices"". Castle looked at a finger at the top of the menu and the finger started to drag the menu down.

""Rick"", Kate said calmly. ""I want you to take your sunglass off so I can see your eyes, and don't give me any bullshit... Now Rick"".

Castle meekly took his sunglasses off and produced a swollen black eye.

""Holy shit Baby what the hell happened? Were you mugged, or wait a minute did you bump into Josh, and he hit you""? Kate came around to the other side of the table. Patrons were looking at them. Kate kissed his face and kept asking if he was okay.

""Honey, please sit down and I'll explain"". Castle took deep breath and said, ""It was Flower"".

Kate put her hand over her mouth trying not to laugh. ""Hum... okay you're saying that our 4 and half year-old daughter clocked you one in the eye and left you with something that Mike Tyson would have done. Gee Babe you're really going to have to explain this one in your best storyteller details"".

""Well, I went into the laundry room like you said, and I looked around and saw no way she was in there, so I turned around to leave, and she pops out of the basket and screams and me. I jumped so high that I ran my head into the edge of the door. Then I turned around and see she has my underwear on her head with the part of my underwear that has no business being on her face.

This whole time listening to Castles story Kate had started to lose the battle containing her laughter at her husband. ""So, Babe what happened after the underwear fiasco"".

Ha Ha... I'll have you know that I was in mortal pain, but I grabbed Flower and ran to the bathroom to wash her face off, and that's when I found out that her mother has been teaching her cuss words"".

Kate huffed, ""What the hell are you taking about"". Already knowing that she had a tendency to have a very colorful way with naughty words, though Castle never complained about them in bed.

""Well, while talking to our little girl I found out just how bad Mommy's potty mouth has been. Flower asks me if I was mad at her and asked if she was an Ass now. I asked her why I would think that, and she said that she saw that Mommy called Daddy that every so often, even when she wasn't mad. I told her that wasn't a nice word, but I wasn't mad at her. Then she laughs and says good I don't want Mommy to think I'm a little shit.  By this point, I'm trying to keep from laughing, while explaining that was another bad word. She asks me if the words are so bad why does Mommy keep saying them""?

Kate with her cheeks turning bright red said, ""I wasn't aware I was doing that Babe... I'm sorry, I'll try better to watch myself. What did you tell her""?

""I simply said that Mommy at a young age used to ride with the Hells Angels, which is a motorcycle gang, and she got tatted up, and part of the initiation was you needed to swear like a truck driver. I think we need to institute a swear jar. I think it should put Flower thru college at the rate you swear.

Kate sighed; ""You didn't really tell her that did you?

""Honey off course not. I told her how much you love her, and that sometimes police see a lot of bad people and bad words come out now and then. It's okay Kate, she'll forget the whole conversation after my eye stops swelling. Can I put my sunglasses back on honey""?

Kate purred, ""Of course Baby. My big strong hero Daddy and husband. I'll even let you tell people that you got the black eye, saving an old woman from being mugged. I actually think you kind of rock the badass look. I just might have to have, my wicked way with you tonight"".

""My ruggedly handsome face will be marred until further notice, but I would like to keep my manly reputation from being ruined. Somehow, you're having your wicked way with me could go a long way towards the healing process, so I'm all on board with you making my owie feel better.""

Kate laughed and reached across and planted a loving kiss on her husband's lips. She said, ""Babe, I asked you down here today to tell you something I just found out"". It was a surprise. Kate hesitated, she knew that Castle wanted another baby, but still she was apprehensive. I went in to get a regular check at my OBYN, and found out were going to have another baby.  Her husband stood up, his face crinkled at the edges of his eyes, that she loved so much, and a big smile broke widely across his face, and he yelled out to everyone in the restaurant.

""My wife is having a baby everyone. My beautiful wife is pregnant with our baby. People in the restaurant started to applaud as Kate let her hair fall over her face and tried to hide from embarrassment. Castle grabbed Kate from where she sat and proceeded to pick her up and swing her around, Kate started laughing at him while yelling.

""Castle...Rick... put me down you goof ball, and let's order lunch. I have to get back to the precinct soon"".

As they sat down and ordered Castle said, ""I'm so happy honey, this is so awesome. What a nice surprise. I can't wait to tell Flower; she'll be so excited"".

Kate laughed and said, ""I know, she's been asking me lately if she would ever have a brother or sister. I think I got pregnant when we were in the Hamtons last month. Alexis was watching Flower that day, and we went at it like rabbits"".

""I remember you being insatiable that weekend. Couldn't get enough of your ruggedly handsome husband"".

""Yeah"", Kate smirked, ""I don't quite remember it exactly that way, as you were chasing me around the house trying to rip my clothes off"".

Castle laughed, ""All I remember was the screaming and moaning. I remember a loss of hearing for a short period of time"".

""Shut Up you big ass"", Kate blushed.

""Now...Now...Now... Honey. Language"".

""Ugh. Fine"", Kate mumbled.

""Being with the love of my life and in the Hamptons making our baby, life doesn't get any better than that. I love you so much Kate"".

""Castle"", Kate stammered, ""Don't make me cry while I drink my strawberry shake... I love you too Babe... so much"".

Rick trying to change the subject so as not to get his wife upset while she ate said, ""Oh by the way guess who I ran into outside the restaurant""?

Kate sighed, ""I was hoping that he would be gone by the time you got here. The conversation was weird, and I was trying to not bring up your name up, because you were always our biggest argument, and it was bad when we broke up. Even though it's been 11 years or so I didn't want to deal with any animosity or other bullshit. He said he was thinking of quitting DWB to start a new life, so we parted ways amicably. What did you guys talk about. Was it okay or ugly""?

""I thought you told me you really, really liked him that day on the swings. you never told me it was about me"".

""Babe what was I supposed to do the day on the swings. Tell you that I had loved you for quite a while, and that Josh and I argued about that. You know what I was like back then, there was no way that was coming out of my mouth, and as time moved on it didn't seem important anymore. I've told you a hundred times, that if I could do that time over again things would be different"". Kate wanting to get off that touchy subject asked, ""So what did you guys talk about""?

""He basically started to jump down my throat asking what the hell I was doing here, and when I said to have lunch with my wife, he blurted out, ""Your married to Kate""? So, I said yes and that you've always been my first priority and that I thanked him for always making you second. I think he used the f word as I entered the diner"".

Kate sighed, ""I'm, sorry you had to go thru that Baby"".

""All good honey... I liked gloating. All the time I had to deal with his crap, it was a nice payback"".

""Babe, I'm running late, I have to get back to work. Don't tell Lilly about the baby until I get home, okay? Stay here and finish your pancakes, before they get cold, and I'll see you tonight. Just order takeout, Italian sounds good. That way we can spend time with Flower and tell her"". Kate placed a warm kiss to her husband's lips and walked out the door.

Castle watched her wave to him thru the window, and he blew a kiss her way, then she got into her car and went back to work, and her Captain's job.

As Castle poured syrup over his pancakes, he thought back on how far Kate and him had come. 11 years ago, he never saw this future, even though he had always been an optimist. Kate was with Josh, and seemed to be happy, plus the whole Montgomery thing, the arguments, the shooting, and then if that was not bad enough a year later the lie to protect her and her lie about remembering and that she almost died off the ledge of a building. It seemed so bleak at times, but it just goes to show that if you really want something bad enough you have to fight for it and above all else keep showing up and never give up. Maybe their battle to be together no matter what life threw their way is what has led them to having such a strong bond. All he knows is that Kate is his soulmate, and he was and is the luckiest man in the world. A beautiful woman and daughter who have become his everything. A baby on the way, and a daughter that looks like Kate and has his eyes. He was indeed a lucky man.

He looked at his plate and thought, ""These pancakes are awesome, too bad they can't make happy face pancakes, because today that would be the perfect pancake... Oh well, I think I need more syrup"".",1,1732361109.0,CastleTV,0,0.67,False

In Nov we already had 2 and another 2 are scheduled for Dec. Last one was called ,thanksgiving party’, usually they are big parties, with food and drinks and some extra attractions and company pays for everything. 

Am I overreacting for not being thrilled to attend these parties? They always take place during week, afterwork so it means I have to spend my private time there. I am young, single, no children so it’s not like I have other responsibilities to attend to. It’s just that I prefer to spend my time and party with my real friends and I hate being forced to pretend that I’m close friends with my coworkers.

Don’t get me wrong, I like my coworkers, we’re all similar age, and I think they like me too. We have hybrid work model, so whenever I go to the office I always make sure to chat with people a little, go for a lunch/coffee together etc so I think the atmosphere is generally friendly, but still professional. But the company parties are draining me. 

The worst part is that people in my team seem to be always very excited about these parties and there’s almost always full attendance. Saying I don’t want to go, or going for only 1-2 hours is never enough, they ask a lot of questions and im forced to make up fake excuses. I even reached a point, when I called in sick for a few days, just to avoid going to recent party.

Anyone has similar feelings or is it something wrong with just me?? Someone please tell me I’m not the only one……

Should I suck it up and just go to the parties and pretend I’m having fun or say NO when I don’t feel like going?

I get that’s my own issue and I try not to force it on my husband. But every time we need to go somewhere I am sat waiting for him. 

He underestimates how long it takes him to get ready, and will often do seemingly unnecessary things like trim his beard or nails when we are running late. I feel they’re unnecessary as I wouldn’t start doing my eyebrows if we were late, and it’s never anywhere that requires him to be smart. 

Right now we have an appointment in 33 mins. Google is saying it’ll take us 30 mins to get there. He’s just gone to the bathroom for a number 2 and I can hear him laughing at videos on his phone. Before going in he said he didn’t know how long it would take and he needed me to relax. I don’t understand why he can’t just get his timings right so this doesn’t happen every time we go out. I don’t think it’s unreasonable of me to get stressed out when we are always potentially late for everything. 

I understand my preference to be 10/15 mins early isn’t his so I try my best to not push this on him. But it does cause me anxiety when we are always verging on being late. Am I crazy for thinking this is a him issue? He thinks I’m just too stressy. 

Edit to add: this morning he got up 20 minutes before we needed to leave (which was now 15 minutes ago). He’s showered, sat having a coffee while on his phone, cleaned his ears and now gone to the bathroom. Why didn’t he just get up sooner. ",2,1732360477.0,AskWomenOver30,1,0.75,False

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about.",3,1732360459.0,realityshifting,0,1.0,False

As of right now, I'm only preparing two cortados/flat whites a day in the morning, for myself and my girlfriend. Perhaps two in the afternoon, and on rare occasions we'll have 3 friends over. 

Boiler-wise the Europiccola would be sufficient enough, though I plan on modding the beast to get the most out of it. Especially the bong isolator and a thermostat. Modded Pavoni goes for 900+ on the Coffee Sensor, whilst I could get a brand-new Professional for 727€ locally, and an isolator with the thermostat for 69€, or the Europiccola for 617€ locally, + the 69€ in mods from the Coffee Sensor.

Second-hand market as well as eBay is all but dry, nothing reasonable there within Europe.

Having the mods/boiler capacity in mind, which option would be the best? Europiccola without the boiler pressure gauge but cheaper, a professional with the gauge, should I buy mods myself or get a modded one from the Coffee Sensor?

not much is known about Tetra aside from the fact that she sets up shop around the country doing tattoos she does the first ever traveling tattoo tailor  which is only spead though word of mouth 



She is rather mysterious nobody really know why she acts like this it's just like she appears. 

She was  first a rumor then just some gossip  then she was in the public eyes as she was spotted moving then people started making predictions on where she would go next. She realy gained traction it weren't long untill big influencers traveld around the country to even try coming across her 

This is when TUA gained interest of these skills of her's. She was renowned for having the best tattoos in the business  they soon called and then so was to be known as the unrivalled tattoo artist",1,1732360406.0,MyloMadiness,1,1.0,False
1gxxdj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1gxxdj4/i_made_a_super_niche_app_for_sailors_and_scaled/,I made a super niche app for sailors and scaled it to 500k downloads,"I started developing this app in 2016, and it was my first app ever. I already had several years of programming experience. Since I was studying maritime navigation, I came up with the idea of creating a maritime app to help students with various nautical calculations and learn maritime regulations. Although I had no experience in mobile app development, I chose the Ionic framework and started development gradually.

**First Version**

The first version took me about four months to develop because I literally had to learn everything from scratch: how to develop mobile apps, how to publish them, and everything needed to enable downloads on the app stores.

Many of you might recognize me from [my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1g3hrw3/i_grew_my_mobile_app_to_14_million_downloads/) about developing Sintelly and its late monetization. I made the same mistake with this maritime app. At that time, in my country, there was no possibility of earning through in-app purchases, only through ad displays. Since the app was predominantly downloaded in countries like India, the Philippines, and Indonesia, the ad revenue was quite low, and after some time, I removed the ads.

**Abandonment and Realization**

As I started developing other apps, this one fell into obscurity. I even just remembered that I needed to renew the domain, which resulted in losing it. The domain buyer tried to sell it back to me for years for $20k, which was absurd. All this led me to rebrand and start working on this app again.

Interestingly, during these 8 years, the app never showed a declining trend in installations or active users. I'll share some numbers to give you insight:

* Total installations (Android + iOS): 501,000
* Active installations (Android): 48,000
* Monthly active users: 20,000
* Average rating: Android 4.8, iOS 4.7

When I considered these numbers, I realized they weren't bad at all and that I was far ahead of most competitors. This led to my decision to rebrand and create a new website. I quickly built the [website](https://primonautic.com/) using WordPress and published lots of existing content from the app. What surprises me is that today, after a year and a half, the website has about 8-10k monthly organic visits.

**Choosing a Direction**

Based on all this, I decided it was time to create a Premium version and start selling the app. Since I've been working with AI for many years (which I've written about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1g4x299/how_i_started_learning_machine_learning/)), I started thinking about using AI to help seafarers speed up some of their tasks.

This led to the idea of creating a multi-agent system equipped with numerous tools to help seafarers. I developed various agents with functionalities, including retrieving maritime weather information, locating and tracking ships, doing various nautical calculations, calculating the shortest maritime routes and unit conversions, and learning about all courses and maritime regulations.

All this required considerable work, but thanks to tools like Cursor and Claude, I implemented it in less than four weeks. Last week, I published [this new version](https://primonautic.com/download/) and started selling subscriptions, and I can already boast that I've earned slightly over $100. This isn't much, but I'm happy to see my first app generating some income, which I always thought impossible.

Along this journey, I learned many lessons, and the most important one is to never give up or write off a product. With a little effort, everything can be brought back to life and secure at least some passive income, enough for your morning coffee. Additionally, I learned how to develop mobile apps, which has shaped my career since then. If it weren't for this app, I probably would never have become a developer.

I have numerous plans for what to add next and how to improve. I'll base everything on AI features and push the app in that direction.",3,1732360401.0,SideProject,0,0.71,False

1gxxczh,https://www.reddit.com/r/streamentry/comments/1gxxczh/how_do_i_prepare_physically_for_my_first_retreat/,"How do I prepare ""physically"" for my first retreat?","I intend to participate in my first 10-day Vipassana retreat in March 2025 (from dhamma.org).

I have two questions concerning the retreat:

- Which position do students meditate in? I currently meditate cross legged on my couch for the back support (twice 1h a day).

I doubt every student gets a couch during the retreat, and I don't think I can currently sit comfortably for one hour on the floor without back support. I also can't sit for an hour on a normal chair (with perpendicular legs) because it is damaging for my back. I can sit on the floor for a long time but I need to regularly change positions, which is not ideal.

Whatever students are doing, I need to know so I can train my body for it.

- intoxicants are forbidden during the retreat - what exactly is an intoxicant? I've read that you get tea, which contains caffeine, this is technically an intoxicant.

Is coffee considered an intoxicant as well? I drink coffee daily, it helps a lot with my ADHD. If I can't have it during the retreat I need to know in advance to take steps to reduce it dramatically. I do not think I would get the most out of the retreat if I suffer from caffeine withdrawals.

Thanks you for your insights 🙏",2,1732360334.0,streamentry,5,1.0,False

Dasom Seol: dasom treats zalia as a mother figure  which makes her uncomfortable 





Creators  synopsis:

Zalia  is an interesting character for  me as she doesn't like colour and doesn't wish to stand out  she has a mindset of if you need colour to add meaning  to something then  it didn't mean anything to start with.

 the reason why she shuts her emotions off  is so nobody can get though her shell of not caring as she realy cares too much to what people think of her.   

she was taught from a young age that modesty was key and her purpose as a woman was to be obedient to her husband and provide children for him. Her being a lesbain conflicts with this expectation  of her. 

She got famous from her drawing of a woman in shackles  crieing for help lot of people found out and  TUA ( the unrivaled administration)  gave   her of the unrivalled award of fine art. From then forward she was to be known as the unrivalled fine artist",1,1732360222.0,MyloMadiness,1,1.0,False

Hi, 

I’m 34M from Britain (England). I’m open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain (I am based in the East Midlands), as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc.

1gxx31m,https://www.reddit.com/r/FTMventing/comments/1gxx31m/now_i_have_to_wait_again/,Now I have to wait.. again. ,"Long story: 

So I attended my GIC appointment yesterday.
Firstly cannot fault the clinician on theur explaining, detailing, information, they were very friendly and very pleasant for the majority of the appointment and was amazing for some topics.

However I felt I was being provoked at times.

Last year I made a complaint, had a whole process because the clinician (different)  that time was abit rude and wouldn't explain to me when I asked questions. I spoke with the director and I was fobbed off with ""she likely needs a holiday"". Left it at that. She never referred me to Endo and as such I was left to self medicate for abit, I asked when my appointment was and was told that I wasn't referred and don't have one so they emergency referred me. She also withheld my clinical assessment for over a month and I was wrongly discharged whilst still going through the complaints process. 
_______________________________________________

So, 

I went for my ""1st surgical assessment' in hopes to get referred for metoidioplasty (already had top). The whole appointment they yapped about my upcoming hysterectomy and that they can't tell me not to do it but to strongly reconsider and look at my options. They said ""if testosterone is suppressing your cycle then what's the difference if you don't have the surgery"" I said because I know it's in there. Apparently that's not enough and I should still look at my options. T didn't suppress my cycle I have to take a blocker every day too. Also they told me to speak to a local gynaecologist about if I should do it. They don't have the training for trans people, the local clinic even said that to me hence they bounced me to the gender affirming surgery teams for the hysto.  

They tried hinting at me to swap from gel to nebido whilst telling me that nebido wrecks bone health and that also the Hysterectomy wrecks bone health. I have no intention of swapping. Endo said to be on Gel due to it being stable and the best option for my mental health. 

I was asked if 1 is the worst you feel and 10 is the best where do you sit? I said 5 because I feel neutral, relaxed and okay. Not good enough apparently I need antidepressants because I should be at an 8 which I said I don't need because I feel okay since T and surgery my mental health is alot better than it was. I'm sorry who the fuck is happy af in this economic climate. We make do, we get on and have fun. 

The whole time they kept saying ""you can report me if you want I don't mind"" and ""you can ask for someone else next time"". That feels like ive been set up as a troublesome patient because I made the complaint last year advocating for myself amd for more info. I felt like I was being provoked and that they wanted me to be angry which I'm not an angry person, I just wanted more detail and my documents which I wasn't getting.

At the end of the appointment I was asked if there's anything else I mentioned metoidioplasty and I got a ""No"" you've not been on T long enough. So for the sake for 4 months till I meet criteria that I will cover anyway before the 2nd letter needed I'm being made to wait 12-15 months. 

I was also indirectly called obese i got ""your BMI is quite high""... I go to the gym 3-5 times a week, I eat low carb - high protein, no fizzy, no sugar or sweetener. I gained weight since T and my hip fat went to my stomach which I'm losing. None of that was taken into account at all they just said that I must be eating alot which I don't. I even told them I have reminders on my phone to remind me to eat. 

I'm assessing my options, what I can do and what's feasible because now im delayed till at latest 2032 with waiting lists.
They didn't like that I did top surgery myself, they didn't like that I self medicated. The clinic has mostly failed me than helped me. After 5.5y waiting the only thing they've actually done is prescribe my T. 
My mum came with me and she was in shock from the provoking and telling me to rethink the hysto that I've wanted for years and was originally  referred for my period issues. 

Any words of help about seeking out metoidioplasty, funding for it, if I can use private diagnosis like you can for hysterectomy. Just anything will be much appreciated right now. Lastnight I sat up and if I wasnt of T I would have cried alot. I felt so shit after that. They were lovely for the most part but those areas just no, I left there, sat in the pub with a coffee to try and chill out. I would have 2-3 wait for both letters and then 3-4 years wait for the surgery anyway so I don't understand ",3,1732359242.0,FTMventing,0,1.0,False

**The Science Behind PAP-Integrated Whitening**

The power of ONOSONIC’s teeth whitening products lies in our innovative PAP (phthalimidoperoxycaproic acid) formula. Unlike traditional peroxide-based whitening treatments that can cause sensitivity and irritation, PAP is designed to break down stains on the teeth safely and gently. PAP works by oxidizing stains, resulting in effective whitening without causing pain or harm to enamel. This formula has been tested clinically, so you can trust it to be both safe and effective.

**Easy, At-Home Whitening Options for Your Convenience**

With ONOSONIC, you have the flexibility to choose the whitening option that best fits your lifestyle and preferences. Each product is easy to use, making it simple to incorporate teeth whitening into your daily routine.

Hi, 

I’m 34M from Britain (England). I’m open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 


If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and connect. 


**Looking for platonic friendships only.

The fruit soda was okay naman but more on ice and it doesn’t taste like strawberry 🥹 then we waited sa pizza for like 10 minutes so we thought like masarap yung pizza but guess what. It so disappointing!!!

1gxwxtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1gxwxtd/iqos_ruined_my_health/,Iqos ruined my health ,"Hello, 

I used iqos as a “healthier” option to quit smoking. Before I used to roll a tobacco. 
It is 2 years now since I quitted tobacco and started smoking iqos. 

In these two years my health went really down, started to get heart palpitations, shortness of breath, stomach issues - reflux out of control, gastritis. 

When smoking tobacco, I used to have 5 cigarettes per day, with Iqos it can get till 12, since I do not get the same satisfaction from smoking one cigarette. 

I did not smoke for 3 days and today had one cigarette again since today is Saturday and I have a coffee+ cigarette ritual on this day. 

This morning I was feeling so happy and euphoric since I did not smoke these days and now I ruined it for me. 

I got mad and threw away the device and cigarette leftovers.

I will start again, but am little bit afraid since smoking of course became part of my personality and I am afraid to become the boring person if I quit (addiction speaks lol)

At the end of August this year, dont remember why exactly, I replied to an instagram story and we caught up a little.

We kept texting every now and then and, as we go to the same college, we've met to have coffee a few times (everytime things went pretty good actually, no awkward moments or anything that would make me/her say ""why tf am I here"")

Through good networking, I have a lot of useful resources like past exams, which I share with everyone in need. I gave her a lot of resources and offered her some help with a module I'm quite good at. Her communication via text gives me the impression, that she feels overwhelmed and thinks I'm expecting something in return. More specifically, I think for her, there is 'the elefant in the room'; that she thinks I have dating intentions. 

I like her a lot, but I don't have romantic intentions. I think we would not match character wise, as she is shy, sensitive and cautious, while I am outgoing, energetic and talkative. Also, while I think she is a cute girl and great person, I don't feel the spark. 

Still, I would like to be friends (is this weird? lol). 

How do I best adress this? Ideally via text, as I think suggesting to meet for a coffee would send even more confusing signals.
