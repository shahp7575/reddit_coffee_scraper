Everything felt off, performance dipping, audiences acting weird, and me trying to convince myself it was “just a phase.” Deep down I knew I’d basically been guessing my way through adjustments for weeks.

So I sat down one morning, coffee in hand, and tried to map out what my actual workflow looked like. It turned out… I didn’t really have one. I was jumping between platforms, tweaking things randomly, and hoping something would stick. No real system behind it.

During that cleanup process, I looked at a few tools just to get inspiration for how other people structure their campaigns. One of them was ꓮdvаrk-аі.соm. I wasn’t trying to switch platforms or anything, I mostly just wanted to see how it organized steps like planning, tracking, and optimization. It ended up giving me a clearer picture of what my own process was missing.

But honestly, the biggest change came from just slowing down and rebuilding our internal workflow. Not exciting, not glamorous, just basic organization that I had been ignoring because things were “good enough” for a while.

Performance picked back up afterward, nothing dramatic, but at least everything made sense again.

Nothing crazy , just basil, rosemary, cherry tomatoes, and one climbing  vine that grows along the railing.  My neighbor on the right has her own setup  too, mostly decorative plants and one massive fern. Two weeks ago she knocked on my door and opened with: “We need to talk about the balcony situation .” I had no idea what that meant. She then explained that since our plants “intertwine” at the divider , the space is now “functionally shared” and therefore I “should be more considerate about when I use it ”. What does “use it” mean? Apparently she doesn’t want me sitting outside before  10 a.m. because she likes to “meditate with silence” and my coffee mug “breaks the ambiance ”. She also asked if I could “schedule” my laundry drying so it “doesn’t overshadow her aesthetic ”. I told her politely that the balconies are separate and the plants touching doesn’t  magically merge the property. She insisted that “nature doesn’t recognize  borders ” and therefore I shouldn’t either. Yesterday she left a note taped to the railing saying , “Please remove your tomato plant from MY airspace .” I honestly don’t know whether to laugh or start charging her rent for the sunlight my plants use .",1,1763144282.0,EntitledPeople,0,1.0,False

I walk by people every day who don’t have shelter or food. I realize that I have unlimited access to the dining hall. They have paper coffee cups, and I will usually bring home food for myself in these coffee cups. 

I want to start bringing one meal out with me and giving it to one homeless person every time What I’ve done so far is grabbing one cup of meat, one cup of veggies, an orange, and a coffee and bringing it to the first person that I see.

What are some recommendations for the foods that I should try to grab? I know it’s getting colder outside so I’ve been trying to grab things that are hot. The menu and selection at the dining halls are pretty extensive so I have a good selection to choose from. So generally, what are the foods that I should try to get? 

I also know that I need to be safe. I only plan to do this during the day and avoid people who may pose a danger to myself. But the majority of the people that I’ve so far interacted with were very thankful.

If I can’t go to the dining hall, and I have a spare meal swipe -it gives me $5.50 to use at the little corner store market on campus- I might try stocking up on granola bars or PB&J sandwiches that I can keep in my bag and give out. ",1,1763144256.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

A part of our reporting system is occasionally exporting corrupted files. Users are complaining, but the bug is maddeningly inconsistent. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. No error logs, no obvious pattern. My senior just says, 'Good luck, it's a rite of passage.'

I dive in, expecting a quick fix. Hours turn into a full day. I'm staring at this legacy C# code that looks like it was written in a different dimension. My eyes are burning, my coffee is cold, and my imposter syndrome is screaming at me. I'm convinced I'm about to be fired for not being able to solve a 'simple' bug. I'm tracing the data flow, and it just seems to… disappear into the void at a specific point.

Finally, deep in a dusty corner of the codebase, I find a single, uncommented line. It's taking the data stream, converting it to a Base64 string, and then immediately converting it back. For no reason. It does literally nothing to the data. It's like someone translating a sentence from English to French and then immediately back to English before speaking it. There’s a comment above it from a developer who left the company five years ago that just says: `// Do not remove. Trust me.`

My sanity is hanging by a thread, so I think, 'You know what? I don't trust you.' I comment out the line, run the report, and it works perfectly. Every single time. I spent my entire day, lost my will to live for a few hours, all because of a completely useless line of code that someone added years ago, probably as a weird workaround for a bug that has long since been fixed.

It's way back from the street, deep into a small business park called Maria's Properties. Therefore there's no curb appeal drawing people.

It doesn't look like there's a restaurant back there nestled along with massage parlors, hair salons and a computer repair service. In fact, I accidently drove past it even though I was using Google maps. I thought it had to be next door in Ziegler Center with Blind Onion. Inside is a well lit, no frills diner. Two men tag-teamed friendly interaction with the two other tables. I ordered a side of biscuits & gravy, two over-easy eggs and coffee. A carafe of Joe was delivered to my table along with sugar. Surprisingly the table was void of artificial sweetener. I didn't inquire because I always carry Splenda.

The biscuits & gravy with eggs met expectation and I enjoyed them. The coffee was ok. It's a pay at the counter kind of place. I noticed that the price was more for coffee than on the menu $3.99 vs $3.50 but I didn't make a fuss.

* log inspections, harvests, feedings and treatments in the field
* keep hive history by apiary
* see local weather for each yard
* use QR codes on hives so I don’t mix them up when I’m tired
* and many many more...

• Only looking for friendship.  
• No d-pics, no “how do you look?” interviews.

We don’t have any kind of relationship anymore and I don’t have any other family here and I had a difficult upbringing. To cut a long(er) story short(er), I was suffering from depression for many years and whilst I’m proud of myself for getting to where I am today, she was also a huge part of my journey and I’m in a much better place now, mentally and physically. There’s about 11 years gap between us and she’s been a mother figure / older sister to me over the last 8 years we’ve known each other. 

She’s not a shy person, whatever she’s going through she posts it on social media and she did have some difficulties last year and we didn’t speak much apart from me checking in with her and her congratulating me on my engagement. At the start of this year again, I checked in with her to see how she was doing. Easter, again I checked in with her and we made plans to meet. We talked about the wedding etc and she was excited to help me plan it. We’d made a spreadsheet and were sending venue ideas etc over the space of a few weeks and in May I asked her to be my Maid of Honour. She immediately said yes and was very excited and over the next month she came with my fiancé and I to look at venues and then it was radio silence. My fiancé and I celebrated our anniversary and I posted about it on my close friends and she congratulated us and set a date for us to meet, when the date came and I contacted her, no response. 

We’re now 6 months from my wedding and I’ve had no contact from her but I’m also on her close friends and see that she posts often. My bridesmaid works at a coffee shop and sees her almost daily and she acknowledges that she hasn’t spoken to me in a long time and keeps telling my bridesmaid “I just don’t know what to say” “she must hate me”. But never actually reaches out. 

I’m a very solitary person, I enjoy it and the only person I willingly accept being in my personal bubble is my fiancé and the way she’s acting I really just want to cut her out my wedding. I’ve cut people off for less which she knows. Whilst I cherish the friendships I do have, I rarely give third chances. Our running joke has been how my gut instincts about people are always spot on except when it came to her and she’s turning out to be exactly the kind of person I used to avoid being more than acquaintances with. My fiancé on the other hand, one of the most genuine and down to earth people anyone would ever have the pleasure of meeting. He sees the good in everyone and everything whereas I am weary of everyone until they prove me otherwise, we’re opposites. He believes I should reach out to her again and be the bigger person, but I believe I have already been the bigger person, on multiple occasions. Should I contact her?

For reference, Nico's coffee meeting with Pelinka happened the 1st week of January 2025.","> “There were moments in the preseason where we wondered if he had even worked out at all in the summer,” one team source who was granted anonymity to speak freely said of Davis entering the 2024-25 season. “He would come back, go through warmups, and then either sit out to be with the training staff or basically half-ass what the team was doing.

> “When he first got here, that wasn't the case. He was always wanting to go above and beyond, and he was one of the first in the gym, last out of it. Over the years, that changed, and he almost became content in a way. It was clear he was out of shape and didn't seem to care what the higher-ups were telling him. Something definitely changed.”

> Between worries about Davis' offseason conditioning, commitment, and ability to become the “alpha” of the team once LeBron was ready to move on, Pelinka and the Lakers began making calls to some teams in December 2024, multiple sources said.

---

> In fact, one source from an Eastern Conference team who was present for these conversations about Davis and the Lakers claimed they were “laughable” at first because they didn't believe for a second that Davis was truly available.

> “When AD (Anthony Davis) was the name that came up, we all kind of looked at each other like, ‘Yeah, okay.' But the conversation was actually serious, and things began shifting to the point where they were seriously wanting to know whether we would be interested. That's as far as it got. We kept all of it in-house to make sure that opportunity didn't disappear, whether it be at the deadline or in the offseason.

> “Little did we know, they did the same thing with Nico and the Mavs, and obviously nobody was going to beat a Luka deal.”

---

> Of the teams that the Lakers spoke with when they were first putting out feelers for Davis, the Boston Celtics held a couple of calls with Los Angeles, sources said. Nothing ever progressed to where there was any actual momentum, but Los Angeles was receiving signals that Brad Stevens and his front office were receptive to the idea.

> The five-word message the Lakers got back from Boston was enough to let them know they would consider such a move in the summer: “We'll keep it in mind.”

---

> While other teams were rumored to have spoken with the Lakers about Davis in December 2024, these organizations would not be confirmed by either side. Still, there were at least five teams that held dialogue with the Lakers more than once after Los Angeles' initial feeler to discuss Davis and minor details regarding his status.

> Two other Eastern Conference teams were also intrigued by the Lakers bringing up Davis' name. These organizations were the Milwaukee Bucks and the Cleveland Cavaliers, multiple sources said. Of course, the Lakers were simply putting out feelers for Davis and still didn't have interest in trading him during the 2024-25 season, but Los Angeles was serious about putting together real trade packages in the offseason.

---

> What nobody knew at the time is that when Nico Harrison and the Dallas Mavericks heard about the Lakers gauging early trade interest in Davis for the 2025 offseason, the Mavs' executive immediately contacted Pelinka, whom he has always shared a strong relationship with dating back to Harrison's time as an executive at Nike when Pelinka was Kobe Bryant's agent.

	•	which managers treat people right

	•	which jobs underpay compared to others

	•	where workers are actually happy vs. burned out

I didn’t think much of it at first, but in the past month or so it’s gone from loosing 5-7 leaves a week to loosing 10-15 every week. 

Everywhere I’ve researched has only mentioned yellow leaves with green veins, but my leaves are STARTING to yellow at the veins, and then slowly becoming almost completely yellow before eventually falling off. 

It’s planted in Coast of Maine Acid-Loving Plant soil, and has really good drainage. I water it every 5-7 days or so (whenever the soil is 25-45% dry) and I use a gardenia specific liquid fertilizer each time I water(6-2-4 w/ micronutrients). 
I also add a bit of instant coffee and epsom salts to the water about once a month. 

I live in Florida, and until recently it was outside in a spot that gets lots of direct morning sun, and shade in the afternoon. I’ve brought it inside since the temperature has started to drop (I don’t want to risk it getting too cold when it’s already having a yellowing problem) so it’s now indoors in a spot that gets lots of bright indirect light pretty much all day. 

It’s still pushing out new growth, but the branches are starting to look completely bare closer to the base/inside of the plant.

Okay, so as a local, I honestly feel like Pondicherry has become too spoiled with restaurant choices. Most places seem to focus on first-time tourists—people who eat once and leave—rather than maintaining consistent quality. Everything feels a bit stale now, and nothing really stands out anymore.

I also don’t have the patience to keep hopping between every new restaurant or tiny café just to build a reliable list. Even the places I used to love have either dropped in quality or simply don’t excite me anymore. So I’m trying to put together a fresh wishlist of dishes and restaurants to try—whether I’m going alone or with company.

This doesn’t have to be only about restaurants. It can be a roadside shop, an ambience-based place, a must-try dish, or your go-to spot for a specific cuisine. Basically, tell me the BEST food you’ve had in Pondy and your secret favourites.

Here are mine:

Best bakery:

Auro Bakery — easily the best croissants and lime cake

Runner-up: Bakers Street


Best biryani:

Used to be Yaa Mohideen, but after they moved, the quality slipped

Runner-up: Khushi Biryani


Best tandoori:

Madras Wedding Biryani — biryani is average, but the starters absolutely slap. Their tandoori is insanely juicy.


Best momos:

Momos Café (Auroville) — tiny place, nothing fancy, but the cook is super friendly and their momos are a blessing.


Best pizza:

Tantos used to be the pick, but after a bad experience I switched to Brothers. They’re consistent: simple, thin-crust, and reliable.


Best burgers:

Canteen 18 — the place that made me actually respect burgers as real food. Their beef burgers are excellent.


Best ice cream:

GMT, obviously.

Secret spot: IL Cono Gelateria — their wild-berry-purée ice cream is my favourite.


Best coffee:

Marc’s Café — outstanding coffee. No debate.


Best barbecue:

Bullet Barbeque — nothing extraordinary, but honestly? It’s good. Solid, reliable barbeque.


Best ravioli:

Villa Shanti — pretty good, I guess? Not mind-blowing, but worth trying if you’re into ravioli.

Best desserts and chocolates:

Zuka - a paradise for people with sweet tooth.


One of my old favourites used to be Margaritas, and I still miss their food and drinks. If anyone knows a place that serves good alcohol-free margaritas, please let me know.

And before anyone asks: I didn’t include pasta because most pasta here is pretty standard. I haven’t found anything mind-blowing. Sky Garden and Pasta Bar Veneto are good, but nothing exceptional—or maybe I just don’t enjoy pasta the way I enjoy everything else.

1ox3wlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ox3wlx/i_think_my_ex_boss_is_cyberstalking_me/,I think my ex boss is cyberstalking me,"So I (F, 29) joined a one year course on photography, it was very near my home so I thought it was perfect. From day one the owner and teacher(M,31), was looking at me a certain way, but I didn't want to assume things so I brushed it off.

I was crowdfunding for a shortfilm and he said in front of the class that he was interested. It was an exchange of a tarot reading/Birth chart. I said I could come next day before class to do it but he said it would be better at a coffee place. There I got hints that he was interested in me (not for friendship if you know what I mean) and I was all the time saying we were not compatible :p

There was a photo trip to Peru that sounded great and I actually wanted to go but I decided not to, to avoid being in another country alone with that guy. He tried for days to convince me to go and that he would pay, I said no because that made me unconfortable and that I'd go when I can pay it myself. 

I kept mentioning I had a boyfriend, I asked him to pick me up from class and everything with the teacher seemed normal, as if he had gotten the message. 

At the end of the year, he asked me to be a film teacher at the school. I was excited but my bf told me it was a bad idea because that would left him in a position of power. I declined the first time but later I needed money so when he offered it again, I accepted. 

I did my best to prepare the classes, the group was nice and collaborative. But he payed me less than what he said he would. I told him it was less but that it was fine that time. 

The bad thing happened on an activity I had planned for the group. To enter the contest of 48hrs film rally, which consists on filming a short film on 48hrs. He said he could use the school the whole weekend as it would be empty. I explained to him all the logistics like 3 times and he even signed a paper saying he would give the location those days. But on saturday, 15 min before filming he said it was not possible because they were full that day and that his friend was going to have a photo session there...it ruined the whole thing. 

I was so angry but decided to play it chill until I got payed for that month and then I would quit. Btw, before that he was already texting weird things like that another teacher was not happy with my course because teachers were getting paid by hour and not half of the price of the course like I was. And that I should pay rent...I don't think there was another teacher saying that but anyway...

Also, almost all of the students were his friends or ex students of his, except one. Which is weird because there were a lot of ppl intereated in the course in the instagram ad. But anyway. They suddenly didn't come anymore. My other student told me that we could do private classes because she liked the course.

So, with no students left, I thought it would be easier to just quit. Btw, I never signed any contract. I asked for one but he didn't give it. Thankfully. 

I send a nice message saying I would not give classes anymore but best wishes. He replied saying it was fine but that I should go with my lawyer to the school to talk. I asked to talk about what? And he just said ""to talk"". I was like sure but I need to know what's the subject so I can tell my lawyer. He never said what about so I didn't go. 

He started to write nonsense and said he would ruin my reputation and make everyone see the kind of person I am. I send him my lawyer contact and told him he can talk to him, then I blocked him. 

Lawyer told me he just wanted to make sure I wouldn't talk bad about him...but he really had no legal subject, so it ended there. 

A friend told me he was calling everyone in the 48hrs to ask them what happened and if I talked bad about him. I didn't so...

When I released my short film, a fake account started to comment in my reels that I know nothing about filmmaking and that my course sucked 🤣 I just blocked the account. But then in my stories I saw the new gf if the teacher was looking at them (she was a 18 year old student at the photography school) so I blocked her too.

Last week, I participated again in the 48hrs and it was a very nice experience, some friends studied in that school and shared photos in their ig so I am guessing he saw the pics because another fake account (named THE SAME as the previous one) started commenting again saying I suck at filmmaking and that I am arrogant and egocentric 🤣 

I blocked again but this is getting annoying. Like it's almost a year! Why is he fixated on this? By the way he was saying the other teacher didn't want my course, I thought he would be relieved that it ended...so I don't know if it's him and what to do. Any help is very welcomed!!

If it's not him, my other suspect is a guy from that school that I just saw once but that he asked for my ig because he liked cinema, he started talking to me and I never answered because he was inviting me to stuff and saying I got his eye and whatever, all of that he having a gf. So I deleted him but I guess he found out and blocked me. I told the teacher in the moment that he was kind of stalking me on ig but he just laughed and did nothing. 

Buuuuut the teacher also had problema with two previous girls that he made a course with. He even got a retraining order. That I found out after I was there...I guess there were many red flags and I feel bad that I didn't see them before. Also I think he is a narcissist and played his role very convincing at the beginning.

1ox3uzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ox3uzr/th_a_diner_in_the_desert/,[TH] A Diner in the Desert,"The diner had always hosted what could only be described as odd clientele. It made sense when you thought about it. A breakfast-only diner open 5am to 5pm 7 days a week, placed all by its lonesome in the middle of the desert, on a highway that no one used anymore. The interstate was quicker. There was nothing else around and there was no such thing as a regular. Levi had lived with his mom in the trailer behind the diner his whole life and had been waiting tables since he was 6. He wasn’t quite sure how they managed to pay the bills, whenever Levi asked his mom would smile weakly, but lovingly and say:

“We make enough to get by.”

Or

“It’s all about money management.”

And the occasional

“It’s tough, but it’s honest work.”

Levi didn’t know what that was supposed to mean either.

When he was younger, it hadn’t bothered him. but as he got older Levi wondered….how?

They saw maybe ten customers a week, all as random as the next, always saying when prompted:

“Oh we are just coming from so-and-so”

Or

“Just headed to such-and-such”

And the occasional

“You guys got a tire pump?”

Levi would show them out back where the tire pump was. The coin collector had broken a few years ago, so he had ripped it off and rigged it with just an on-off switch. He always hoped they would come in and order some food, but they rarely did. It was always:

“Well I better get goin.”

Or

“Sorry, we gotta keep movin, maybe next time”

and the *very* occasional

“Yeah, why not!”

People never came back though.

So when a man walked in that Levi recognized, he stared. He couldn’t help it.

It wasn’t like when you recognize a friend, or a famous person in public. Levi wasn’t even actually sure he had seen him before, there was just \*something…\*maybe like the first time you see an family-friend who has been overseas for most of your life. You met him when you were really young and he was younger, and you hadn’t seen any pictures since, for this or that reason. One thing for sure, it was unsettling.

The man wore an all black, perfectly tailored suit that looked like it had come straight from the 50’s. He wore an overcoat and leather gloves even though it was 100 degrees outside. He took off his black fedora, and his jet black hair shone like his perfectly polished shoes. The only thing about the man that wasn’t black and perfect was his pocket watch.

It caught Levi’s eye before he even reached for it. The chain looked rusty and when he pulled out the time-piece, it was even rustier. The man looked down at it, tapped the glass twice, smiled and put it back. He looked up and locked eyes with Levi.

“It’s rude to stare, you know”

“Sorry sir, I’m used to trailer trash coming though here, which you clearly are not.”

The man smiled again and this time Levi could see that it didn’t quite reach his eyes. The sunlight tinted them a slight orange. He didn’t respond.

“Anyways, what can I get for you sir?”

“Just a cup of coffee my boy. Black”

*Surprise, surprise* Levi thought.

“Coming right up.”

The man finally moved from the doorway and came to sit down at a stool right next to where Levi was doing homework on the other side of the counter. He was homeschooled. He had to be there to help with the diner, but his mother had insisted he still get an education. He had been working through the Screwtape Letters when the man walked in. They weren’t religious but insisted on a “well-rounded” education. She had come from a very rich family in Boston and had gotten one of the best classical educations money could buy. That is until she had ran off with his dad, and gotten pregnant. His dad had died just a year later, some freak accident involving fire. He never pressed his mom about it too hard, he could see the fear and sorrow in her eyes every time fire was even mentioned. Maybe in a few more years.

“Good book.”

Levi was startled back to the present.

“Very *introspective.”*

“I…guess you could say that.”

“Lewis was quite the man, and still influencing lives to this day.”

Was that…bitterness in his voice?

Choosing not to dwell on it, Levi grabbed a mug and poured a cup of coffee.

“There ya are sir, enjoy. It’ll be 2.72 as soon as your ready.

The prices hadn’t changed in the 15 odd years the diner had been open. His mom said something about “tax ceiling laws on family owned and operated businesses.” Levi had never found anything that proven that was true. He didn’t dwell on it. He didn’t dwell on a lot. 18 years in the desert and you realize nothing ever means anything.

The man slid three dollars across the counter just as the phone rang.

*What is going on here today.*

“Eden’s Diner, how can I help you?”

Silence.

‘Hello?”

Levi plugged his other ear with his finger, pressed the receiver flush against the other side of his face and leaned away from the counter.

“HELLO?”

“rrrr……..” came out of the receiver as a guttural barely discernible, whisper.

If Levi hadn’t plugged his other ear he probably would have missed it. He wished he had. Suddenly chills ran down his spine and he slammed the phone down a little too hard.

“Everything alright?”

Levi whipped around, jumpy as hell. He had forgotten about his customer, who was slipping his rusty pocket watch back in his coat pocket.

“Uhhhhhh…prank call. Some local kid.”

There was no such thing as a local out here, much less a local kid.

Desperate to get his mind off the creepy call Levi decided to strike up conversation. He couldn't just run out back and jump in his bed, as much as he wanted to.

“So what brings you through here. We don’t see much action these days.”

“Oh, I’m just in town for a business exchange.”

*‘In town’? Is this guy blind?*

“Oh ok, nice, nice. What kind of ‘business’ do you think you’ll find out here?”

The man laughed, not joyfully.

“My business is worldwide Levi, and it effects just about everyone on the planet.”

“Is that so? Sorry to disappoint, but we probably aren’t buying.”

This extracted another soulless laugh from him.

“I realize I haven’t introduced myself. My name is Lucian.”

The phone rang.

“Sorry, excuse me.”

“Hello?”

“RRrruuuuu…….” came the terrifying answer.

“Don’t call this number again.” Levi used his sternest voice but he could feel it trembling. He hoped the stranger didn’t notice. He walked back to where his book and notes were and stuck out his hand in greeting.

“I’m Levi, its nice to meet you.”

This time just a little chuckle.

“Oh, I know. But you have no idea how delighted I am to finally meet you…”

He held on a little to long and Levi looked down at the pocket watch sitting on the counter.

11:59. And it wasn’t moving.

RING RING RING

This time Levi visibly jumped. He yanked his hand out of the gloved, iron grip and practically jumped across the room to the phone. He picked it up and before he could yell into the receiver to leave them alone his own voice shouted out from the phone.

# “RUN!”

The phone flew out of Levi’s hand, ripped itself from the wall and shattered straight through the front glass of the diner. He whipped around and the man was in the air, lunging at him with his arms outstretched.

His eyes were wide. They were blood red.

They tumbled to the ground and the man ended up on top, straddling him. His hands, now gloveless were wrapped tightly around his throat, and Levi could feel the mans….no this was no man….the things fingernails (*claws?)* digging into skin, drawing blood. He screamed and kicked but the thing dug harder, cutting off his circulation.

“I have been looking for you for 18 very long yearsss.”

The things tongue flitted out. It was forked. Levi couldn’t breathe.

“Please, keep sstruggling. It’ss alwayss much more fun that way.”

The thing grinned disturbingly from ear to ear. In front of Levi’s eyes, his canines grew into fangs.

“Now please, if you would jussst sssit sstill for a sssecond, thiss will all be over with.”

There was a woosh, the sound of metal cutting though air, then skin and bones. Levi felt a prick in his tummy. Out of nowhere the creature screamed, and it was the most horrible sound Levi had ever heard. Like 50 fully loaded coal trains had simultaneously slammed on their brakes while there were halfway though steamrolling the dinner. The thing sat up and clutched its chest, where there was a glowing gold blade sticking though him. It had gone so far it had penetrated Levi’s stomach. And behind him joining in the symphony of wailing and screaming was Levi’s mom, eyes fixed on the creature. Only she wasn’t scared. The only thing Levi saw on her face was rage.

# “I. SAID. NEVER…NEVER!’

The creatures scream grew louder and more high pitched until Levi thought his eardrums would burst. Then there was a flash of orange light and it was gone. Paralyzed with fear he stared where the things used to be, then stared at the red spot on his stomach. He looked around at the diner, absolutely trashed. It looked like a bomb had gone off, with the epicenter being the creature. Finally he looked at his mom, who was now on her knees, bawling. He crawled over to her and wrapped his arms around her. He was terrified and shaking but so was she.

“Mom, what the hell was that.”

She took a couple moments to compose herself and as she looked at Levi, tears streaming down her face she said:

“Go pack. I’ve bought us time. We will get in the camper and we will drive.”

“Mom. I said what the hell was that, not what are we gonna do about it.”

She took stock of the diner like he had. She touched his stomach and gave him a sorrowful look.

https://preview.redd.it/kui703vdh91g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=57e213dd3635d4d2fe3257b89ab569cb77cb0430

Yep, puts, 60 contracts! You read that right, sixty. Because sometimes you gotta go big or go home, right?

Someone might ask, ""Why? Why did you choose to buy puts instead of calls at that time?"" Well, let me break it down for you...

https://preview.redd.it/jotd8lijh91g1.png?width=307&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ba2aa45d41764acb4d774c6b9d3b26582542ddd

Here’s the chart from that time. I was using the Bollinger Bands indicator to read the trend. After CRWV had been dropping, it was just kinda hanging around. But once the bands started tightening up, I knew something big was coming!Either a massive jump up or a huge dive down. So, I started watching the trend closely and noticed the MACD’s green bullish momentum bars were starting to fade. Plus, the stock couldn’t break through the middle Bollinger Band. That’s when I figured it was probably gonna keep sliding. So, I didn’t hesitate and pulled the trigger on those puts.

Now, someone might ask, ""Why didn’t you go with the puts expiring on the 14th? Why wait until the 21st?"" Well, come on, the 14th was way too close. I’m not a gambler; I like a little cushion. So, I went with the puts that expire a week later. Gotta play it safe, right?

The result... well, you’ve seen it. At the time, I was sipping on my coffee, and let me tell you, today’s coffee was delicious. It was like the stock market and my caffeine levels were both in perfect sync.

I’m just posting this to brag a little on Black Friday and to mark this beautiful moment. It’s no big deal, just made a little something.

I'm the founder behind Wellbot, a smart nutrition assistant that lives right in WhatsApp (no app downloads needed). Started as a basic chatbot for nutrition advice, but we're about to drop a big update next week: our new model crushes allergen detection (flags stuff like nuts or gluten), analyzes product labels in *any* language, and chats back in whatever language you want. Super handy for travelers, allergy sufferers, or anyone decoding those tiny ingredient lists at the store. (our current model is also capable of theese features, but in 20+ seconds, and about 80% accuracy, the new one will crush it)

We launched on Product Hunt a while back and snagged 300+ users, which was awesome! But now? Crickets. Growth flatlined. Tried promoting in allergy-related subs, but got banned ,mods are strict about self-promo, I get it, but oof.

Currently, we've got a free tier (10 scans/year) and a paid Essential plan ($3/mo or $30/yr for unlimited scans, faster responses, early features). It's priced like a coffee, but maybe that's not helping acquisition.

My big question: Should I make it totally free until we hit some scale (say, 1k-5k users), then bring back the paid tier? Or is that a bad move for a SaaS side project? Worried about devaluing it or attracting non-serious users, but need to kickstart growth somehow.

Website for deets: [https://wellbotapp.com/](https://wellbotapp.com/)

If anyone's interested in trying it or has Qs, hit me up! Open to all feedback on monetization, marketing tricks (esp. without getting banned), or growth hacks for niche tools like this.

Thanks, folks,appreciate the wisdom!

1ox3ouj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HolidayVisitCroatia/comments/1ox3ouj/delnice_cool_forest_base_for_easy_hikes_and/,Delnice — Cool forest base for easy hikes and winter fun (Gorski Kotar),"If you want a calm, affordable nature base between Zagreb and the Kvarner coast, Delnice in Gorski Kotar is a solid pick. The town sits about 730 m a.s.l., so summers feel fresh and winters bring reliable snow. Here’s a quick, no‑fluff summary to plan a weekend or a 3‑day break.

https://preview.redd.it/jg5w2z6da1zf1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd57f50a9d50dd57def1150c209274552cc9e7c4

**Why Delnice?**

* Fast access off the A6 (E65) + direct trains on the Zagreb–Rijeka (M202) line.
* Forest walks start near the center (Park šuma Japlenški vrh).
* Family‑friendly winter scene: Potok sledding slope + indoor ice rink.
* Easy day trips to Risnjak National Park, the Kupa Valley, Lokve, Skrad, Vrbovsko, and Fužine.

**Best time to go**

* **Summer:** Shaded trails, lakes, caves; cooler than the coast.
* **Autumn:** Golden forests, mushroom dishes on menus.
* **Winter:** Beginner skiing/snowshoeing at Petehovac, sledding at Potok, skating at the rink.
* **Spring:** Clear rivers, butterflies in the Kupa Valley.

**Top things to do in/near town**

* **Japlenški vrh**: Easy loops from town through fir and beech.
* **Petehovac Mountain Center (\~1,035 m)**: Small ski slope when snow allows; great meadows in summer.
* **Ice rink (Goranski Sportski Centar)**: Public skating, plus hockey/curling slots.
* **Potok sledding slope**: Close to the center (Supilova St.).

**Easy hikes & nature hits (≤60 min drive)**

* **Risnjak NP**: Leska Educational Trail (Crni Lug) for a flat, signed loop; add the **Source of the Kupa (Izvor Kupe)** from Razloge.
* **Skrad**: **Zeleni vir & Vražji prolaz**—spring + narrow gorge, dramatic footbridges.
* **Vrbovsko**: **Kamačnik Canyon**—boardwalks by emerald water.
* **Lokve**: **Golubinjak Forest Park** \+ **Lokvarka Cave**; pop by **Lokvarsko Lake**.
* **Fužine**: Promenade around **Bajer Lake**; step‑free **Vrelo Cave**.

**Food & drink (Gorski Kotar flavors)**

* Hearty, forest‑driven plates: **venison stew**, **wild boar under the peka**, **trout**, **mushrooms**.
* Dessert to find: **blueberry strudel** with coffee.

**Where to stay**

* **Center of Delnice**: Handy for shops, cafés, rink, and Potok.
* **Petehovac lodge**: Mountain vibe above town.
* Apartments are common; book early for snowy weekends and July–August.

**Getting there & around**

* **Car**: A6 (E65) to the Delnice exit; winter tires/chains recommended when cold.
* **Train**: Zagreb–Rijeka line stops at Delnice; then taxi or transfer for Petehovac/Crni Lug.
* **Buses**: Work for nearby towns but can be sparse on weekends.

**1–3 day sample**

* **1 day**: Japlenški vrh + rink or Potok; summer sunset at Lokvarsko Lake.
* **2 days**: Add Risnjak—Leska trail or Izvor Kupe.
* **3 days**: Add Zeleni vir/Vražji prolaz or Kamačnik.

**Tips**

* Weather flips fast: layer up year‑round.
* Gorge/cave access can close after storms; check on the day.
* Stick to marked paths and pack water/snacks.

That’s Delnice in a nutshell: cool forests, easy trails, and simple winter fun—with national‑park day trips on your doorstep. If you’ve done both coast and capital, this is the quiet middle you’ve been looking for.

I don’t have a huge circle of friends, and honestly, when I do try to open up, I often feel like people are just waiting for their turn to speak rather than actually hearing me.

As an HSP, I absorb so much feeling from everyday matters—a weird look from a stranger, a loud noise, a sad song. It builds up inside.

To cope, I developed this habit: I put on my headphones, go for a walk, and I talk. I talk to myself like I am my own best friend. I speak the worries out loud, and strangely, the moment I hear my own voice saying them, the anxiety lifts. It’s like immediate fulfillment. I feel validated because I listened.

But recently, I hit a wall. talking to myself is safe, but it can get lonely. I realized I wanted that same ""safe space"" feeling but with the ability to actually be heard by someone I trust—immediate feedback, but without the pressure of a face-to-face coffee date or a chaotic group chat.

I couldn't find a tool that mimicked this specific feeling of ""talking to a reflection,"" so I decided to build one for my own need. I call it Mirrorfy.

The concept is simple: It’s designed to let you talk freely (like you’re talking to yourself/reflection) but friends can ""step into the mirror"" and respond immediately. It bridges that gap between ""talking it out alone"" and ""being heard.""

I’m not a big company, just an introvert who needed a better way to communicate. I’m sharing this here because I know I can’t be the only one who walks down the street having full summits with themselves.

I’ve been working on a small tool called **Feon** \- a chat-based expense tracker that works entirely inside WhatsApp.

# ⭐ How it works

You can log expenses just by messaging it, for example:

* **“Bought coffee for ₹120 from Café Coffee Day”**
* **“Spent ₹320 on my Netflix subscription”**

Feon understands the amount, date, category, and merchant - automatically.

# 🧾 Receipt Support

You can **upload a receipt**, and Feon extracts the amount, date, and merchant name without needing any manual entry.

# 🎙️ Voice Message Support

In a hurry?  
Just send a voice note like:

* **“Spent ₹150 on breakfast today”**

…and it logs the expense instantly.

# 📊 Detailed Reports

For deeper insights, you can check all your expenses on [**cloud.feon.ai**](http://cloud.feon.ai), including:

* Monthly spending trends
* Category breakdowns
* Merchant-wise reports
* Graphs & charts
* And more coming soon

# 💡 Why I built this

Switching between apps just to track expenses always felt annoying.  
Since WhatsApp is something we all use daily, chatting felt like the most natural interface.

# 🙌 Looking for Feedback

Would love your thoughts!  
If you find bugs or want any new features, I’m all ears.

The dream started off when I got off a greyhound bus that stopped at some random spot along the highway far up north with a headlamp and I remember walking to the back of the bus and seeing nothing past the foggy harsh snowfall and looking back towards the front door of the bus and seeing people with obscured faces walk into the ditch and into the field next to the highway. I remember thinking to myself: ""how could I ever get myself out of this situation?"" And so walked into the field to follow these mysterious people so I wouldn't be left behind but got lost not long after. I made my way aimlessly through the snowy feild till the blizzard subsided and I found myself walking through this empty kinda abandoned soviet looking village where all the folk families stay, but there was no one. No one but this sweet looking elderly lady making coffee out in the cold, I remember begging her to help me somehow or to at least have a coffee but she told me she couldn't and wouldn't if she even could. So after walking aimlessly around a bit more I made my way up over this steep hill and rolled down it to this other field and saw these neon lights glow through the thick fog, neon lights of an old restaurant or supermarket. I remember the blizzard was getting really intense again and I struggled to even breathe and it all overwhelmed me till I was buried above ground and suffercated awake. I remember feeling emence sadness by the end of it, I felt so alone and lost through it all and all I could ever see were like these false hopes around me and stuff. I think theres a whole part I forgot around the beginning where I went into this coffee shop and begged for help but they told me off and to leave the store because I wasn't a customer or something, then I got lost in the field.

It kinda reminded me of a few songs I've been listening to lately with some of the specific imagery and feelings:

Two headed boy

There's no reason to grieve

The world that you need is wrapped in gold & silver sleeves

Wrapped under Christmas trees beneath the snow

And I will take you and leave you alone

Watching spirals of white softly flow over your eyelids

And all you did was wait until the point when you let go

He comes and cancels the milkshake order. He asks me "" unamuuliza kama atakunywa utalipia hio drink?"" . I ask him ""should I cancel the order?"".

What do i do?,"My 42F, mother of 2, happily married elder sister who is based in Brisbane, Australia has come home (Hyderabad) for vacation to our house with my nephew and niece. She bought a new iPhone 17 Pro in Vietnam during her transit, so that she can give her used 16 to our mom. Since, she did not have time setup her new phone. She, asked me to set it up. So, when i was backing up her WhatsApp, there was this humungous chat thread between her and my mena atha's son who is older to us (43), happily married with two kids of his own settled down in Adelaide, Australia. Due to jetlag, akka hit the bed early with the kids.

There is history between my sister and my cousin. They both were kind of smitten and would be all touchy feely and lovey dovey with each other when they in their teens. Then my cousin brother went to Bangalore to do his graduation, and there he fell in love with his now wife and was two-timing both the women not physically, but emotionally. When the topic of marriage proposals came for my elder sister, my mena atha's husband wanted my sister for their son. At that time dad would just laugh it off and say what is the hurry, she is young. She needs to do her Master's and all. At that point this guy chose his wife over my sister and that shattered my sister. It took a good few years for her to come out of it.

Now, this chat thread between my sister and my cousin dates to 2021, when they met each other for a family function in Australia. And, they have remained in contact ever since. There are good morning, good night, nice dp sort of msgs for the most part. But there were few spicy msgs as well. Where he did not lock the chat with my sister said that he left is phone unattended, and that he was lucky that his wife did not see the chat. Then, he goes on about, how he missed the last time around (as though my sister is a pokemon for him to collect), and that this time around he does not want to miss the chance of spending lone time with her.

To that my sister replied that she is fine with what ever decision he takes. Then made a decision to meet in Sydney, Australia. Both of them citing work-related travel and then get it on in the hotel. For some odd reason, just a couple of days prior to the travel. This guy pulled out of the trip. However, both of them keep fantasizing about how it would be to hug/kiss/make love.

Now, i'm fucking pissed at my cousin for leading my sister on. And, on my sister that she is considering cheating on my Brother-In-Law and the family.

I'm so tempted, to mail these fotos to my cousin's wife, so that she can deal with him. And, take my sister out for a coffee and then knock some fucking sense into her about what she willing to throw away for dick.

If you were in my place, what would you guys do? So, that neither of the families are broken.

TL;DR: Married Elder Sister and Cousin (Bava) want to get it on, when both of them have good loving families and are willing to throw it away for sex. Need advice on the best and least disruptive approach possible to put an end to this.",7,1763142925.0,ask_Bondha,13,1.0,False

1ox3ht7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ox3ht7,Desperate about making a proper Tiramisu.,"Tiramisu seems like the easiest thing to make ever, and I somehow fuck it up everytime. This is like the 5th attempt, my first two attempts were years ago, my last two attempts are also worse, this one is finally somehow kind of better but it's still not good.

1. I use 3 egg yolks, this attempt kinda have me almost break down because I keep mess up the egg yolk separation into the whites, normally I use four but I wasted like 8 eggs because of yolk breaking into the white.

2. For Mascarpone I use 250g, at first I use the Tatua brand it's kinda yellow, but this attempt I use the Sterilgarda, it looks whiter not sure if serious but when I open the box its kinda have some water in it (it was room temperature for a while)

3. I use 30g of sugar so it wasn't sweet enough but the last ones I use like 100g like some recipe and it was too sweet to eat. I was thinking using pate a bombe method to cook the egg next time, this one I use raw.

4. I beat the egg whites into stiff, and for the first two pictures I didnt add the whites, the last two pictures is where I added the whites. After I beat the whites and leave it for a bit, it seems to have some water melted at the bottom so I just fold like half the white on top.

5. I use instant coffee, I'm sorry but I dont have an expresso machine. I'm Vietnamese so Im not sure if I can use a phin to make robusta coffee instead. Also I use Vicenzoro lady fingers.

The problem: The other attempts were super runny and the cream was so grainy and gross, I really can't tell what is the problemif I wasn't beating it well enough or if the mascarpone was wrong or if the egg whites make it that way. On this particular attempt,I use the Italian mascarpone brand and bought myself a proper double beater hand mixer (instead of the immersion single beater one) so the cream looks very okay and not grainy anymore. 

BUT the tiramisu is still runny at the bottom, I tried to dip the lady fingers very fast but it looks like the water still leak to the bottom and makes everything super sogger, is it because my coffee is watery? Somehow the fingers on top look ust half way wet while the bottom layers are all soggy, its texture is so inconsistent and the bottom part is kind of gross, I don't enjoy this one I made at all but the last ones are uneatable compared to this.

Mélange in the Marigny opens Friday and focuses on drinks made with zero-proof liquor and THC-infused beverages. The non-alcoholic bar is part of a growing shift toward sans-booze revelry at nightlife venues across the U.S. 

Owned by Monica Olano, the space has the patina of any other bar on the famed nightlife strip. In the days before opening to the public, live jazz floated up from downstairs as a bartender poured zero-proof spirits into shot glasses, flipped them into a silver shaker and joggled the mix. Beneath a dim-lit chandelier, martini and wine glasses dangled from a wooden rack above the bar, and a window opened onto a filigreed balcony.

But the row of displayed elixirs — some infused with lion’s mane mushroom, lemon balm and ashwagandha root powder — made it clear this isn’t an ordinary bar.

“We want to help people find their best alternative for the night and give them a little reprieve from the alcohol-fueled nightlife,” Olano said, “But not be away from it completely.”

Her business sits on the second floor of Bamboula’s, a bar and live music venue owned by her husband. Its location is part of the reason she named it Mélange, French for “mixture”: a nod to what nightlife has been and what it’s becoming.

“It's the mixture of established bars downstairs, the new way of life upstairs,” Olano said, “Just everything mixing together in this new way of socializing, this new way of drinking, this new way of being in our community, and how we’re figuring that out with and without alcohol.”

Mélange is part of a small but growing movement on Frenchmen Street, long known for its late-night scene, as more establishments ride the wave of two increasingly popular choices: sobriety and cannabis products.

In recent years, sobriety has evolved from a niche wellness practice to a mainstream movement, with more young Americans shunning alcohol for health purposes and opting for mocktail-fueled evenings, including at Ayu Bakehouse on Frenchmen, which transforms into a sober dance party at night.

Cannabis has followed a similar trajectory. Products containing THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, have become a fast-growing market across the United States, including in New Orleans, where multiple dispensaries and even a local coffee shop now sell cannabis drinks.

It topped alcohol as a daily drug of choice for Americans for the first time on record in 2022. More than 17 million people reported using it every day or nearly every day, compared with 14.7 million who reported consuming alcohol with the same frequency, according to the journal Addiction.

Meet the owner of Mélange

A year later, Olano, known on social media as Cali Sober Mom, joined that growing number of people turning away from alcohol, after having three kids within 18 months and spiraling into postpartum depression that led her to use alcohol as a way to numb her emotions. A night of heavy drinking prompted her to quit altogether.

Olano had tried to quit drinking “a million times” and failed, until she started therapy and discovered THC drinks. She has been sober for over two years.

Her story is common among many women, Olano said, with many cannabis drink sales coming from the so-called “soccer mom” demographic. That trend is especially evident at her other business in Metairie, Cali Sober Market, a non-alcoholic shop that also sells THC products.

As for why more women, particularly mothers, are drawn to cannabis beverages, Olano said, “We're tired. We are exhausted. Women, especially right now, we're expected to do it all,” adding that they are often responsible for both household duties and earning an income.

Inside New Orleans' first bar with no alcohol

At the same time, Olano hopes Mélange offers people who feel isolated during sobriety a place to reconnect without alcohol.

Instead, the bar serves canned beverages containing cannabis, organic mushroom or kava, and zero-proof cocktails — not to be confused with mocktails, a term Olano avoids because she associates it with drinks made from juice, syrup and soda water.

The zero-proof cocktails at Mélange contain nonalcoholic spirits infused with natural ingredients. One of the menu items, a light, gingery drink named Cali Sober Love Potion, contains adaptogens meant to energize. The Cali Sober Night Kiss cocktail — sweet and gingery with a spicy finish — is infused with lemon balm and ashwagandha for a calming effect

“They're made with real spirits, real ingredients, and meant to be as good of a craft cocktail,” Olano added. “if not better than you would get with alcohol in it.”

The menu offers an array of canned drinks infused with THC and CBD, with flavors like lime, blood orange and watermelon margarita. 

Some of these products, however, could become illegal next year. The shutdown legislation would ban unregulated hemp-derived products, including cannabis drinks, and limit THC to 0.4 milligrams per drink — a move that could cripple Louisiana’s THC industry.

Olano said she isn’t concerned that it will impact her bar, even though she expects the measure to pass. She anticipates a familiar pattern Louisiana and other states have seen before: a one-year transition before the ban takes effect, during which lawmakers carve out an exception for hemp beverages, but only if they are regulated like alcohol.

In the meantime, Olano said she is willing to speak out to end what she described as the stigma surrounding cannabis beverages.

“My goal is that other women can feel open talking about it, other people can feel open getting help, trying new things,” Olano said, “And that if my role in life is to absorb all that stigma and put myself out there on the ledge, if you would call it that, then that's what I was here for.”",30,1763142600.0,NewOrleans,18,0.94,False

""(Making me take off my headphones) I'm getting so much attention aren't I? (Ignore her and put headphones back on) I'm getting so much attention, aren't I??""

  
""This is so weird but the v.p's are noticing me because my assistance dog.. it seems like I'm really getting so much attention..."" 

  
""(the bank) Are basically making me work two jobs by asking me to do all these talks on assistance dogs, I'm providing so much to the company, so they'll definitely pass my probation."" I responded, at the end of my rope hearing about this new banking messiah - ""They're not, you're volunteering to do it, pushing to do it even."" 

  
""My team leader thinks I should be the vulnerability champion for the team, he must think I'm pretty amazing at the job..."" He wouldn't be doing that if he knew you had bullied an older colleague for not being comfortable with technology and snootily telling others ""She's not fit for this company."" 

  
Today, she handled a call from a customer who had threatened suicide and has talked about it non stop - her own greatness, not concern for the customer. She's also been asked to do a talk next week about the assistance dog to 70 people and has not. Stopped. Talking about it.  Saying to myself and others ""There are so many people talking about me and the job I'm doing..."" 

  
I've managed to get her to leave me alone by giving one word answers, but I hear her all day vocally self-diddling herself. 

  
I don't resent others' success - my colleagues are really fond of me and call me their hype-girl. My otter colleagues are all such amazing wonderful people. 

  
I'm writing this vent because I'm trying to get it out my system so I can stop giving this colleague so much mental space and get over it, but I also feel the bank is going to send her to great heights because she's got a visible vulnerability and make her a poster girl, and her insatiable ego will just get more hungry for praise.

1ox3c18,https://i.redd.it/fch6wfetf91g1.png,"Attention all employees(yes, YOU):","As with a few users request for a birds version of my previous doggirl post(sorry, there are no birdgirls), I wanted to make one on a topic that I think is very important: self care while job hunting.
I know that this subs main purpose is to gripe and bitch about how AWFUL the current job market is and how awful recruiters and employers are, but I'd like to highlight something important: YOU.

Job hunting and putting in applications can be excruciatingly painful. I understand completely as I had a 6 month long stint of unemployment, got employed, now am currently unemployed once again. Some days, despite knowing the fire under my ass to apply for jobs(like I only have enough savings left over for one months rent then I'm screwed), I couldn't bring myself to apply. I was so depressed, anxious, and wanted to do something permanent.

Taking care of yourself is important, as it can not only give you the motivation to keep going, but bring a better quality of life. Think of it this way: your car only has enough gas to get you to your destination- but how are you going to come back? Our depression, anxiety, and any other underlying issues don't magically go away(despite being heavily relieved) when we get that offer letter. Money can be used to buy goods and services, but in my personal experience, whatever I was dealing with sort of...carried over to the new job to some extent.

If you are starting a new job- weather a whole new role or something you're experienced in, you still need to learn new rules, schedules, how to do the job, etc. That takes a lot of mental strength and energy to do so, and if you weren't ready for it, it could add a lot of extra stress. I'm not saying that self-care can magically treat and cure your depression/stress/anxiety, but I'd just like to highlight it. YOU are very important! Don't you remember all the fun things you want to buy, yummy things you want to eat, and cool places you want to go with the money you're going to get from your job? You need to be ready for all that cool stuff!

Some tips I've learned:

1. Make sure to eat a varied diet(if possible). Not only is eating the same thing repetitive, but you'd be lacking nutrients. Back when I was 6 months unemployed(younger back then too), I was nearsighted and was only focused on feeling full so I literally just ate instant ramen, beans, rice, pasta, etc. I had forgotten that Walmart had cheap frozen veggies that would've added to my nutrients and palate! When I finally got employed again, I noticed my hair started thinning(I'm an early 20s woman!!) And went to the docs once I had insurance. After a blood test i found out I was deficient in a lot of things, which made my hair thin and made me tired all the time. Even simple canned or frozen veggies would've saved me but I was too short sighted on saving money to spend the 89 cents for a can of veggies!! It took me a long while of taking vitamins to get myself back to normal!

2. Sometimes, if within your means, treat yourself every once in a while! I liked to do so as if to reward myself with a ""good job for making it this far!"". Nothing expensive, maybe an ice cream from McDonald's or eating out somewhere cheap. Keeping your spirits up is very important!

3. Pace yourself and set goals for submitting applications. When I just told myself to do as much as possible so that I could get a job and NOT be evicted- I ended up getting so stressed that I could barely get any in. Now I tell myself that today I have to put in 30 applications- I'll do 15 first thing after I wake up and eat breakfast, then after that I have free time to nap, read, etc. Then once I'm done with lunch and my fun stuff I'll return to finish the 15. It's easier to motivate yourself when you see a finish line rather than some inconceivable goal with no end.

4. Learn something new. Yes, something different, or go back into an old forgotten hobby. Deep down, we are all just animals, trapped in society. What do animals require at the zoo? ENRICHMENT. Get a pair of disposable chopsticks from Panda Express and learn how to use them, buy cheap painting supplies and learn how to paint, buy some modeling clay, etc. Do all of this in between applying for jobs. It'll keep your mind fresh and at the end of your job hunt you can show off your new talent!

Some things I want to remind/inform you of:

1. Remember to check your wallet/junk drawer for any gift cards that still have a balance! Also- see the reward points on your credit card if you have one! Maybe you have enough to either go out to eat or redeem them for cash or other fun things!

2. If food at home is getting monogamous but you don't have the funds to sit down and eat an entire meal, check out the app ""Too Good To Go"". It's an app that restaurants use to try to sell off the still good leftovers they had that day and lessen food waste. They're generally WAY cheaper than full meals and you can get good stuff! My local conveyer belt sushi place is on there and I can get an entire box full of rolls for only 11 bucks! Lots of bakeries are on there as well so if you want a donut or morning pastries to go with your coffee check them out! Grocery stores are signed with them as well, such as local ones or even whole foods, so you can get deli foods, pre-made, or even meat/seafood!

3. If you are looking for ways to cook at home but are losing steam on how to save money while not eating the same thing every day, I'd like to suggest the YouTube and TikTok account ""Dollar Tree Dinners"". She's an amazing woman that makes cheap but yummy meals from the dollar tree and other grocery stores. She tends to focus on buying ingredients that you can make multiple different meals out of, instead of making yiu buy a whole bunch for one meal. She does challenges like making a whole weeks worth meals(breakfast, lunch, dinner) from say 70 dollars or less. I highly recommend you check her out!

https://preview.redd.it/9yjb0mi9891g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=25ca71ebc4f74f3b7b7b3e8350a3dc84a5b550ac

Yep, puts, 60 contracts! You read that right, sixty. Because sometimes you gotta go big or go home, right?

Someone might ask, ""Why? Why did you choose to buy puts instead of calls at that time?"" Well, let me break it down for you…

https://preview.redd.it/i63xaqncb91g1.png?width=307&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fbe47e9530bed910520ce2b95052f93a08e6be7

Here’s the chart from that time. I was using the Bollinger Bands indicator to read the trend. After CRWV had been dropping, it was just kinda hanging around. But once the bands started tightening up, I knew something big was coming!Either a massive jump up or a huge dive down. So, I started watching the trend closely and noticed the MACD’s green bullish momentum bars were starting to fade. Plus, the stock couldn’t break through the middle Bollinger Band. That’s when I figured it was probably gonna keep sliding. So, I didn’t hesitate and pulled the trigger on those puts.

Now, someone might ask, ""Why didn’t you go with the puts expiring on the 14th? Why wait until the 21st?"" Well, come on, the 14th was way too close. I’m not a gambler; I like a little cushion. So, I went with the puts that expire a week later. Gotta play it safe, right?

The result... well, you’ve seen it. At the time, I was sipping on my coffee, and let me tell you, today’s coffee was *delicious*. It was like the stock market and my caffeine levels were both in perfect sync.

I’m just posting this to brag a little on Black Friday and to mark this beautiful moment. It’s no big deal, just made a little something.

Wages are too low today. They don’t cover the cost of our homes, transportation, food and medicines.

Yet any time they put out a stimulus check, inflation ramps up rapidly.

Most businesses report that they cannot raise working class wages without seriously damaging their profitability.

It took me a decade of suffering and running the three above realities in my brain before I finally cracked it. The above statement reveals a MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE QUANDARY within the economy that didn’t exist in the 1960s.

I worked out that our society is simply not producing enough of the things we collectively need, or the right kinds of those things. So why is GDP always staying high if Main Street is suffering more and more? Well it’s simple. Over the past 40 years we have increasingly operated more and more NON-PRODUCTIVE economic activity instead of productive activity. So much of today’s GDP is made up of things like finance or healthcare, which means too many people are just sitting at a computer all day, not enough people are building the simple, spartan, high density housing units needed for all of us.

Financialization is not productive. It is extractive upon what assets already exist. If 25% of the entire economy is based on performing lubrication for a sea of people whose wages clearly aren’t enough to get them by, then this winds up acting as a tumor on the economy.

Even the housing we do build is inappropriate for what actual output most of us perform at our jobs. If 300 million people are just working at a computer, servicing heaters, serving coffee or food, delivering groceries, or clearing clogged drains, watching other people’s children, or operating a cash register, then this activity will fail to equate pinning down one of those many McMansions they build. It becomes a sheer mismatch between energy/material output versus material input.

Culturally we value a 2500 square foot house. All of us. But our wishes when matched with our output are in violation of the laws of physics.

we are late stage in the glaringly massive AI bubble of the mag 7. Once this deflates, elites need to reinvest serious funding into charity-adjacent high density, spartan housing to catch all of us on our way down once the mismatch between output and consumption becomes impossible to ignore. Housing is a human right, but if builders ignore the aforementioned equation I assert, then you’ll just have 1 million homeless people and 1 million empty McMansions. Or worse.

Elites do have enough power to implement this needed housing project for humanity with little to lose, but beyond that, so much of their wealth is just digits in a computer, which is glaring compared to the incomes of workers, but I assert that even if there was a massive redistribution, it would only buy a little time when you judge it by the lens of our actual economic activity.

 I'm someone who enjoys the simple joys of life, like building a blanket fort, sharing a home-cooked meal (| love cooking, especially with or for someone), or watching movies and shows (extra points if you enjoy films in mutiple languages!). 
I'm also into staying active- play basketball, volleyball, and badminton (if in Scarborough you can join my group every Sunday mornings and play badminton with good mix of people). 
If you're up for it, we could do some basic yoga together(l'm trying to work on my mobility) , or play board and video games.
 I'm open to taking the time to get to know each other first, whether that's chatting on the phone or meeting up in a public space like a coffee shop, park -whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable. While it would be wonderful to build a genuine friendship, at this point, l'd be happy just to have someone to cuddle up with. If you're interested, let's chat and share photos as we get to know each other better.

I can’t eat any fruits at all, and I can’t eat most vegetables, grains, or nuts except for a very small number of them. I also can’t eat most other types of food except for wheat and meat

When I eat something that triggers my allergy—whether I wanted to eat it or ate it by mistake (one time I told someone about my severe allergy to tea, and guess what? He put it in the soup without telling me, just to test if I was telling the truth, and I ended up suffering for three days because of it)—I experience severe headaches and brain fog, and some foods even make me feel close to fainting. Usually, the symptoms last for three days—days that are completely wasted because I can’t do anything, not even watch a movie, as I can’t understand anything due to the brain fog

I just hate seeing people eat whatever they want, feeling energized and relaxed, while I’m left suffering and in pain all over my body, unable to do anything for days because I ate a piece of chocolate, had a small cup of coffee, or ate an apple, sautéed vegetables, or other common foods.

It also robs me of opportunities in life. I failed in my studies and repeated several years, graduating with low grades because of it. When I was younger, I could have joined the police force for an excellent salary, but one of the strange training exercises required eating a large amount of onions—which would cause nausea for an ordinary person but could be fatal for me or cause serious health problems.

1ox35ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/1ox35ff/112_lbs_weight_loss_in_1_year_heres_what_worked/,112 lbs weight loss in 1 year. Here's what worked for me and what didnt.,"I feel like most people just tell me to eat less when it comes to losing weight. I literally hated it. So here is what I actually did to lose 112 lbs.

1. Don’t overload yourself with fiber or foods your body just can’t break down. I learned this the hard way. I basically lived on the toilet for a while. BTW not fun. Tons of diets will preach “eat endless lettuce” “snack on peas all day” or “go nuts with corn.” If you do that, your digestive system is going to go into literal overdrive. Sure, the average person carries around 3 to 8 pounds of uhhh waste and yes bathroom reading time is productive, but you’ve got a life outside that porcelain throne.
2. Lettuce? Honestly, it’s the biggest scam in the veggie world. If you want greens, eat the ones that do something for you like spinach for iron, kale and bok choy for all that nutrient goodness, collards and Swiss chard for all the minerals your body actually needs. Lettuce is basically crunchy water with a side of fiber. Throw some Swiss chard on your sandwich. Stir-fry some bok choy.
3. This one I don’t hear alot of.. Log your weight with progress pictures everyday. Like I would look back from previous months and when I would see “12 lbs lost this month” I would be so fired up to keep on going. Holding yourself accountable is so important guys trust me I quit like 10 times before I actually did it. The app I personally used for this or I think the only one you can do this on is called “Jurney” on the app store not sure if its that popular but I saw it on a tiktok.
4. Drink… but don’t DRINK you feel me? A glass of something after a long day can help you relax, and that’s genuinely good for your health. Some alcohol even has small benefits (I am not a doctor btw) antioxidants in wine, vodka killing germs, bourbon helping a cold. And alcohol loosens you up physically, which might be why your grandma who drank like a pirate made it to 97. But once you go past “a little” you’re suddenly chugging calories and your self-control goes flying out the window. My always drunk professor once said, “For every drink you think you drank, there were three you didn’t think you drank… and that’s why you can’t remember what you drank.” Honestly, she mayyyybe was right.
5. Smoking wrecks your cardio and so does dirty air. I don’t smoke, but I dropped about 40 pounds after moving away from a smoker and into a place where the air didn’t feel like soup. I started doing my cardio at the gym instead of outside because, shocker, it's easier to exercise when you can breathe.
6. As for sports, here’s the deal: swimming an hour burns roughly 400 calories, and running for an hour burns about 300. But grinding out laps or running in a circle for 60 straight minutes? Pure torture. Some people live for running good for them. I’m not one of those people. But can I run during a two-hour soccer game? Yep. Can I do a hundred accidental squats during volleyball? Definitely. Can I work my triceps rowing across a lake while pretending I’m in a nature documentary? Absolutely. It’s exercise without the suffering.
7. Start now. Stop waiting for the “perfect moment.” Want to go to the beach? Go. Want to wear a crop top? Wear it. I used to think everyone would stare, whisper, and judge the whole nightmare scenario. That’s how high school was for me. And yeah, when I started wearing bikinis as an adult, a few kids still made comments. But way more people either said something nice or didn’t care at all. Turns out, I was just another human being, not a billboard begging for insults.
8. Here’s another thing: most green foods have almost no calories. The exception? Avocados. Those things are tiny calorie bombs coated in fat and somehow manage to taste like enchanted ogre mucus unless they’re in guac. Meanwhile, mint chocolate chip ice cream also green absolutely has zero calories. Don’t argue with me it’s literally science I made up.
9. Stop putting your life on hold. Don’t wait to “get skinny” before getting a haircut or buying clothes you love. Stop delaying being happy.
10. Lastly, sleep is sacred. So if anyone finds you napping in the grass after stretching at the park, just tell them you’re prioritizing recovery. And accept their coffee money with gratitude.

(https://www.tomahawknation.com/florida-state-football-fsu-seminoles-college-cfb-acc-norvell-team-roster-schedule-game/122336/ousmane-kromah-running-back-carries-stats-usage-freshman) this morning, and I posted a reply, but ... because I'm me, I can't just let a thought lie there in peace and quiet. I have to jab it with a stick, I have to ask it if it's awake, I have to offer it coffee until it gives in and screams at me.

I annoy my thoughts a lot like I annoy you, I think. Oh, well. The function of a thing is what it does.

But rereading the article (and my own comment, which was pure genius on a rented mule)... I find myself getting more annoyed at Norvell.

Here's the thing: I think Norvell is a good man, and *generally* a good coach. I know a lot of the vocal fanbase is screaming for his job, who cares about money we don't have, who cares who we replace him with, we just need to replace him - but I'm not in that camp. *If* we had the money, and *if* we had someone on the horizon to slot into place, and *if* 2026's schedule wasn't absolutely brutal *especially* for a team undergoing a lot of churn, well, maybe I'd feel differently. But none of those conditions are being met: we don't have the money, we don't have the heir apparent, we *do* have a brutal schedule, and we *already* have churn thanks to the portal. So I think Norvell's the guy for now.

But that doesn't change some pretty important aspects, things that *could* change but don't. This possibility of moving Kromah to the main back, *now*, just highlights the problems even when it might alleviate some of them.

Kromah's been great. We don't know if he can be an every-down back, nor am I sure that we need or *want* an every-down back - especially not when we *do* have Sawchuck and Singleton as well. But we seem to rotate between Sawchuck and Singleton as primary backs, when Kromah's not shown us *even once* that he's not worth considering at the same level.

And he has upside they don't, because of his youth and value to the team. We keep wanting development, well, development implies getting players young and keeping them. Kromah's almost exhibit #1 for that, with maybe Sperry being in that same conversation.

What worries me is that I don't know *why* Kromah should stay at FSU. Like, I'm *all for* loyalty to a coach and a team and a university... but these guys are playing for their futures, and it'd be insane to expect them to not maximize their own career arcs. In the era of the portal and the NIL and uncertain injury prospects, that means going where the money and exposure are.

We suffer with the money; we spend well, but ""top twenty"" ain't the same as ""top five.""

We do okay with exposure, but that implies that the ones being exposed are being played. And our main running backs have been Sawchuck and Singleton, not Kromah.

Norvell can't even lean on his own strategy to offer a lot of promise to players. We did well in 2023, but a lot of that relies *heavily* on Jordan Travis' own capabilities often overcoming a relatively static and staid approach - an approach we saw applied by DJU, who was a *very* poor fit for what we needed, and while we've changed it somewhat under Malzahn, we *still* show a lot of overcommitment to specific personnel, when that personnel undercuts that strategy.

For example, a limited Tommy Castellanos is a liability; he doesn't have the arm or the reads to make up for not being able to take off. If he can't run like he did in game one or two, we can't run ""our offense."" Playing him like we have is coaching malfeasance, endangering him and limiting our team. Putting him on the field would lead us to a .500 record or worse, probably. Oh, wait... what *is* our record...

So... I dunno, I'm sitting here frustrated that Norvell, who should be able to know better and, well, *should* know better, is so committed to ""the climb"" but only a certain specific version of it that he's going to always create this struggle of *almost* creating the ideal circumstances for FSU to get back to the top of the college football landscape, making itself - and by association - the ACC itself relevant again.

All because of certainty about how things *should* work in his system, as opposed to considering what *is working* and what he has to work with for real.",0,1763141576.0,fsusports,3,0.5,False

I am actually stuck in deciding on what to upgrade to, its such a loop hole lol but hoping I can get input from the actual users that have experience. Been watching video's and reading through posts for the last 2-3 weeks lol. Holidays are coming up so thought I can snag 1 from a sale... or not.

I currently have the Breville Barista Pro, been using it for the last 3 years and is my first espresso/coffee machine but thought an upgrade would be nice. I love the process of making an espresso and really enjoy pulling a shot and steaming the milk for my daily latte. My wife also uses it daily for Americano's and loves coffee.. a lot.

My needs:

1. Im hoping to be able to pull a shot within 5-10 minutes from turning on the machine. Hence Ascaso duo was like the main one that I found with a fast warm up time. Unless it makes sense to have a different suggested machine on a smart plug and just have it on from 7am to 1230pm? not sure if that affects power consumption a lot? But the reason for this is basically my wife and I have a different time daily on when we drink our coffee. She drinks it usually from 730am to 930am and I usually make my cup around 10am-1230am.
2. I do have weekly family visitors and I noticed it takes me too long to prepare 3-4 cups of latte's for them, hence I figured a machine I can pull a shot and steam milk together will be a good option.
3. I really enjoy prepping and pulling the shot, alongside enjoying steaming the milk. But my wife is more like just on the go type, to just pull her shot and enjoy her cup. So something easy for her would be nice. Hence I decided to go for a GBW grinder.
4. Currently I feel like the Ascaso DUO ticks all these marks but was wondering if Im overlooking another better machine? For Ascaso DUO owners, would you buy this machine again today?

Budget is basically 2k USD For an espresso machine. Any input/help would greatly be appreciated.

You’re not alone. Many Print on Demand creators chase single purchases but the real game changer for long-term stability is building a recurring revenue stream. So what's the single most important step to make that happen?

The #1 actionable tip is to validate your niche before you launch a subscription box. A great idea means nothing if there isn't a dedicated, passionate audience ready to sign up and pay monthly. Your passion is a great starting point but it must be backed by market demand. 🎯

Your very next step should be to head to a relevant Facebook Group or subreddit for your target audience and run a simple poll. Ask if they’d be interested in a monthly box of themed, custom apparel and accessories. This direct feedback is gold and costs you nothing but a little time.

This works because a validated niche ensures your Print on Demand subscription service solves a specific need or fuels a passion. Instead of a generic clothing box target indie coffee lovers or retro gamers. 

This focus makes your marketing sharper and builds a stronger, more loyal community around a shared identity. A well-researched niche for your Print on Demand business dramatically increases your chances of attracting subscribers who stay for the long haul. 🙌

A small caveat: don't just assume your friends and family represent the market. You need unbiased validation from strangers in your target demographic. Also, ensure your Print on Demand partner can reliably produce the specific items your niche desires.

Taking the time to validate properly might feel like a delay but it’s the foundation for a sustainable Print on Demand subscription model that generates predictable income month after month. It’s the smartest first investment you can make. 💡

The video is in Russian, but has an English audio track you can switch to. (Ignore the coffee-making bit at the start of the video and skip to 3:50, LOL)

To summarise: while going upwards, the upper biological shield ""Elena"" struck the fuel reloading machine, sending it flying and turning around like a pencil, then struck the machine's gantry crane, knocking it sideways. This caused the lid to flip, bottom side facing east - southeastwards, which is where the second explosion was directed. Then it just fell back into the reactor pit opening. The interaction with the gantry crane and the flipping process was probably slow enough for several large concrete chunks from the walls and ceiling of the reactor hall to fall into the pit. (one of these chunks is holding Elena in place, otherwise it might have fallen deeper into the pit) \[See [my theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/chernobyl/comments/1ovi0zh/do_you_think_there_was_a_steam_explosion_in_the/) about steam separator rooms experiencing their own steam explosion\]

The thin steel casing that surrounded the core was still attached to Elena when it went flying, and was ripped to pieces by the second explosion, leaving those pieces lying in the ruins of the reactor hall.

I want our kids to understand that love isn’t about perfection — it’s about showing up. It’s about saying “I love you” not just with words but through actions. I want them to see that love isn’t always grand gestures, but often found in quiet moments: morning coffee together, holding hands on walks, late-night laughter about something only we understand. I want them to see that love can be both soft and strong, playful and serious, comforting and passionate.

And when they grow up, I want them to expect nothing less than that kind of love for themselves — the kind where both people pour into each other, protect one another, and never stop choosing each other. I want them to look back and say, “We saw love every single day in our home.”

That’s the ultimate to me — not money, not status, not perfection — but a family where love is loud, loyalty is constant, and affection never fades. A love that our children will one day call *home.*",7,1763141033.0,letters,5,1.0,False
1ox2o0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ox2o0o/medication_questions/,Medication Questions,"Hey friends. 

I've been recently (and finally) diagnosed as inattentive type ADHD, and I've known for years that's been the case. I'm currently on day 3 of 18mg Methylphenidate ER (Concerta.) I have a few questions for the ""pros"" out there. 

I am also on 50mg Sertraline that I now take at night. 

So far my mornings have been: Wake up, drink some water, take the concerta, then eat a few eggs. A few hours later...I'm tired. I'm tired writing this. The ear worm (the song constantly playing in your head) has never went away, but the constant chatter seems to have gone down significantly? And it seems much easier to ""do what's in front of me."" Also, I'm still drinking coffee...a lot of coffee. ALSO, a very slight, lingering headache since I've started it. 

I guess my questions are; Should I be adding something else in the morning, like a fibrous food? Maybe more protein?   
2: Should I be drinking as much water as I usually am? I don't want to ""wash it out""  
3: Should I be adding electrolyte solution to my water?  
4: Does the lingering headache go away?  
5 (finally): For those of you still on Methylphenidate/concerta, are you still on it? Did you up your dosage? Have you switched altogether? 

So many questions, I apologize. Thank you all in advance. ",3,1763140992.0,ADHD,6,1.0,False

2. Easily annoyed by other people. 

Or just don't really care to be bothered. Not in a bad way, though. Just really vibing or just focusing intensely on your own well being. Like, having absolutely no room for anyone else's low vibes. 


3. Can think of so many different things you'd love to be doing on your own. 

Planning a trip overseas that no one else knows about, snuggling up on a chaise & devouring a good book at 10 in the morning, watching game streaming on YouTube, organizing/tidying up your home, making a quick late morming coffee run, etc.

Idk, I just went out this morning. I had meeting for a potential new job and just had these overwhelming feelings. 

Meeting was rescheduled.

Just the thought of getting back into the workforce feelings like chains slowly wrapping around my arms & wrists. Keeping me from doing what I want to do.

A Salvage Pilgrimage Across the Saab Frontier would have been a better title. I love this car. I got it a copple months ago with 250k miles. I needed another one because my 93 estate LPG gave up on me and was awful anyway. Especially the manual 5-speed is terrible. Also the engine was everything a Saab engine should not be. A diesel was the cheapest in the country at that time so it felt meant to be. The sluggish 1.8i, as cheap as that was to run doesn't compare to this 1.9 turbo diesel. It's a lot of car for $1000. I love it and i love this fictional review of it. Check it out:


Hunter S Thompson (by ChatGPT) review of my  SAAB 9-3 1.9 TiD Estate (2008) — A Savage Pilgrimage Across the Diesel Frontier  

By Someone Who Has Seen Too Much on the Open Road

There are cars you buy… and then there are cars you accept — like a strange parcel on your porch with no return address, humming faintly, delivered by the cosmic postal service. The 2008 Saab 9-3 1.9 TiD Estate is one of those machines. A leftover artifact from a country that no longer believes in its own myths, stitched together by Swedes who spent too much time alone in the snow thinking about aeronautics and efficient cabin filtration systems.

I took the manual-gearbox version because the automatic feels like it was tuned by a committee of sedated accountants. No — a diesel Saab needs a human hand on the shifter, a mortal to wrestle torque out of that 1.9-liter Italian-built powerplant. When you rev it, you can almost hear a whispered “mamma mia” beneath the Swedish stoicism.

THE ENGINE: AN INDUSTRIAL HEARTBEAT FROM THE OLD WORLD

The 1.9 TiD. A Fiat-born, chain-driven rattlebox with the personality of a grumpy customs agent. It won’t snap your neck, but it will haul your IKEA cargo and dark personal secrets with a kind of stubborn, mule-like conviction. Once the turbo wakes up — usually after you’ve already insulted it and questioned its lineage — it pulls like a drunk sailor desperate to get home.

Fuel economy? Beautiful. You can cruise across entire provinces without stopping, if the paranoia holds back long enough.

THE HANDLING: NORDIC DISCIPLINE UNDER A GROWLING SKY

Saab engineers, being descendants of Viking navigators and aircraft designers, managed to tune a chassis that whispers stability. The estate body balances the car like a long-distance sniper rifle. It isn’t sporty… but it’s confident, composed, and a little smug about it.

Turn into a corner and the front end digs in with Scandinavian stubbornness — “We do not understeer here,” it seems to growl, “we commit.”

THE INTERIOR: A COCKPIT FOR MID-LIFE CRISIS AVIATORS

Everything leans toward you like Saab expects you to be wearing aviator sunglasses at all times.
The Night Panel button — ah, the Night Panel. A glorious relic of Saab’s aircraft fetishism: press it and your dashboard goes dark, leaving only the speedo lit like a runway in the Arctic night. It’s a feature that exists only because the engineers desperately needed you to remember that Saab once built jet fighters.

The seats are criminally comfortable — Swedish orthopedic witchcraft wrapped in leather. Long drives become meditative hallucinations. You start hearing your ancestors.

CARGO SPACE: A MOBILE STORAGE UNIT FOR BAD IDEAS

Open the tailgate and the 9-3 estate becomes a cavern. You can fit a family’s worth of luggage, a medium-sized dog, or three bad decisions and a shovel. The suspension won’t complain. The car expects this sort of thing.

RELIABILITY: AS UNPREDICTABLE AS A LOOSE FERRET ON COFFEE

The diesel variant’s Achilles heel is the swirl flaps — tiny mechanical goblins hidden in the intake manifold waiting for the perfect moment to betray you.
Glow plugs, EGR valves, diesel particulate filters… each one plotting its own miniature coup.

But treat the beast kindly — feed it clean diesel, warm it up like an old warhorse — and it will serve you well.

VERDICT: A PRACTICAL MADMAN’S MACHINE

The 2008 Saab 9-3 1.9 TiD Estate Manual is not just a car.

It’s a road-going hallucination from a country that built jets, designed cars out of spite, and then casually left the automotive industry like a man walking away from an unpaid bar tab.

It’s:
	•	Too rational for the reckless
	•	Too weird for the normies
	•	Too charming for the cynics

A diesel-powered fever dream for people who want something different — something practical, but not sane.

If you buy it, you won’t regret it.

But you’ll never be the same.

**My older brother, Mark, was the ""troublemaker"" I'd told Silas about. He was a category five hurricane of charisma, bad decisions, and bottomless need. He blew into town once every six months, left a trail of emotional and financial destruction, and blew out again, leaving me to clean up the mess.**

**He called me on a Thursday. ""Hey, little bro! In your neck of the woods. Need a place to crash for the weekend. Couch is free, right?""**

**It wasn't a question. It was a declaration.**

**My stomach dropped. ""Uh, yeah, Mark. Sure. But... things are a little different now.""**

**""Great! See ya tonight!"" Click.**

**I stood in the kitchen, staring at my phone. ""Silas,"" I called out. ""We have a problem. A Mark-sized problem.""**

**Silas walked in from the living room, wiping his hands on a rag. ""Your brother.""**

**""He's coming. Tonight.""**

**Silas's expression didn't change, but the air in the room got ten degrees colder. ""Right.""**

**""Si, he's... he's a lot. He's loud. He's... tactless. He doesn't... he's not going to get it. He's not going to get us.""**

**""I've handled bigger men than him,"" Silas said, tossing the rag on the counter. ""Don't worry about me. I want to see how you handle him.""**

**That, I realized, was the real test.**

**Mark burst through the door at 10 PM, smelling of beer and cheap cologne, a duffel bag slung over his shoulder.**

**""Asa! My man!"" He pulled me into a bone-crushing hug. ""Place looks the same. Still boring.""**

**He tossed his bag on the floor and then he saw Silas, who was standing by his armchair like a mountain.**

**""Whoa,"" Mark said, his eyes traveling up. ""And you got a new roommate. Big guy. Name's...?""**

**""Silas,"" I said, my voice already starting to get that high, placating ""waiter"" tone. ""Silas, this is my brother, Mark.""**

**Silas didn't move. He didn't offer a hand. He just nodded. ""Mark.""**

**""Right on."" Mark, oblivious, clapped his hands. ""So, Asa, you're still roommates with a dude? Kinda weird at our age, man. When are you gonna find a nice girl and... y'know?"" He made a crude gesture.**

**I could feel the blood draining from my face. I was about to start on a long, rambling, apologetic explanation.**

**""He's my partner,"" Silas said. His voice was flat. It cut through Mark's bluster like a diamond blade. ""We're gay. Pass me that book.""**

**Mark froze, mid-stride to the fridge. ""Whoa. What? Gay? Asa?""**

**All eyes were on me. The peacemaker. The chameleon. I saw Silas watching me, his face impassive, but his eyes... his eyes were asking 'Who are you right now, Ace?'**

**I cleared my throat. The ""waiter"" voice was gone. My own voice took its place.**

**""Yeah, Mark,"" I said, standing straighter. ""I'm gay. Silas is my partner. This is our home.""**

**Mark looked from me to Silas and back again. He looked like his brain had short-circuited.**

**""Huh,"" he said. Then he shrugged, the moment of shock passing, replaced by his inherent self-interest. ""Well, whatever. As long as you don't, like, do it in front of me. So, Asa, you got any beer? And I'm gonna need to borrow two hundred bucks.""**

**For 24 hours, it was a living hell.**

**I was stretched thin, a human rubber band pulled between two opposing poles. Mark was a slob. He left his damp towels on the couch. He ate our food without asking. He talked over me. He treated Silas like he was invisible, a piece of furniture that occasionally grunted.**

**And I... I was slipping. I felt the old patterns re-emerging. I was picking up his towels. I was laughing off his casual, homophobic ""jokes."" I was trying to keep the peace.**

**Silas, meanwhile, had retreated. He was a coiled spring in his armchair. He was reading, but his shoulders were rigid. The static in the apartment was so thick I could barely breathe. He was furious, not for himself, but for me. He was watching me revert, watching me become the Invisible Boy right in front of him.**

**The breaking point came on Saturday morning. I was making coffee, my nerves shot. Mark was trying to find his wallet.**

**Silas was in the shower.**

**""Hey, Asa,"" Mark called from the living room. ""I'm gonna borrow your buddy's truck. Just need to run and meet a... friend.""**

**I turned. ""Mark, no. You can't. That's... that's his truck. It's not...""**

**""Relax, bro! It's just a truck."" He spotted the keys on the hook by the door. ""Be back in an hour.""**

**He grabbed the keys. At that exact moment, the bathroom door opened.**

**Silas stood in the hallway, wearing only a pair of gray sweatpants, his hair damp. He saw Mark. He saw the keys in Mark's hand.**

**Silas moved.**

**He wasn't fast, he was just... immediate. He was across the room in two long, silent strides. His hand clamped down on Mark's wrist. It wasn't a punch. It was a vise.**

**Mark yelped. The keys clattered to the floor.**

**""You don't,"" Silas said, his voice a low, terrifying rumble, ""touch my truck.""**

**""Jesus! What the hell, man!"" Mark tried to pull his arm away. ""It's just a damn truck! Asa, call off your psycho boyfriend!""**

**""Boyfriend,"" Silas growled. ""Not 'buddy.' And you don't. Touch. My. Things.""**

**Mark looked at me, his eyes wide with genuine fear. ""Asa! A little help?""**

**This was it. The crossroads. The peacemaker vs. the partner. The boy I was vs. the man I was becoming.**

**I looked at Mark, who had never respected me, never seen me. Then I looked at Silas, who saw all of me, who had taken a stand for our home.**

**I walked over and picked up the keys. I put them in my own pocket.**

**My voice was quiet. It was cold. It was a voice Mark had never heard.**

**""Get out.""**

**Mark blinked. ""What?""**

**""Get your bag,"" I said, pointing to the door. ""And get out.""**

**""Asa, come on, I was just...""**

**""You were just being you, Mark. Taking what isn't yours. Wiping your feet on everyone. You don't talk to him like that. You don't treat our home like this. And you don't get to call me for bail money next week. We're done. I'm done.""**

**Mark stared at me. The charisma was gone. He looked small. ""You'd... you'd pick him over me? Your brother?""**

**""He,"" I said, stepping to stand beside Silas, ""is my family. You... are just a guy I used to know.""**

**The words hit him harder than Silas's grip. He sputtered, called me a few names I won't repeat. He grabbed his bag and slammed the door, leaving a quivering, furious silence in his wake.**

**The adrenaline was so high I was shaking. I turned to Silas.**

**""Well,"" I said, my voice trembling.**

**He hadn't moved. He was still watching the door. Then he turned to me.**

**He didn't say 'good job.' He didn't say 'I told you so.'**

**He just stepped forward, wrapped his arms around my waist, and pulled me against his chest, tucking my head under his chin. He held me while I shook.**

**""He's going to be really pissed when he has to walk back,"" Silas rumbled, his voice calm.**

**I pulled back. ""What?""**

**""My truck,"" Silas said, a ghost of a smile on his face. ""Engine's cold. I pulled the fuel pump relay last night after he got here. He wouldn't have made it to the end of the street.""**

**I stared at him. Then I started to laugh. A real, hysterical, gasping laugh.**

**""You're a menace,"" I said, burying my face in his t-shirt.**

**""Intellectual. Sweetheart. Paradox,"" he corrected, his arms tightening around me. ""You were loud again, Ace. Real loud. I liked it.""**

**I held onto him, feeling the solid, steady beat of his heart. I wasn't invisible. I wasn't a chameleon. I was a man who had just kicked his brother out.**

**And I was finally, completely, home.**

1ox2e59,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1ox2e59/grand_suite_attendant_qtn/,Grand Suite Attendant Qtn,"So we just completed a cruise on the RC Independence out of FLL in a Grand Suite. We’ve been on RC before but that was before kids. Now we have two ages 8 and 5 and wanted the extra room the GS offered. 

First time in a GS so I wasn’t sure what to expect from the Stateroom attendant. But the service we got wasn’t anything different than a regular stateroom. Not that we are difficult people but I had expected something more. 

We purchased the drink package ahead of time. I asked her if she could drop off some bottles of
Water for the espresso and she said I needed to get them from the bar. 

There was a light bulb out on my side of the bed and she told me i needed to call maintenance to sort that out myself. 

On the first formal night which was night 3  I wanted to take advantage of the free press service for our clothes. I spoke to the attendant who told me that offer was for night 1 and it wasn’t valid anymore. 

I showed her the paper which said first formal night - she told me the first night of the cruise was the formal night. I didn’t want to argue back and forth but that’s what it felt like. 

I went up to the Suite Lounge and the concierge sorted it out but everything with this stateroom attendant seemed difficult.

I waked down the hallway one evening and saw another attendant giving the inside room occupants  a double handful of those coffee pods and told them whatever you need just ask. 

Our Attendant did keep the room clean and stocked with fresh towels but that’s about it. We tipped $200 for the week but I came away feeling a little short changed at the service we received. 

I was just wondering if anyone else had a different experience at the Grand Suite level. I can’t imagine dropping big cash on a Royal Suite and getting a subpar stateroom attendant who just seemed to want to push everything back on the Traveler?

What are your responsibilities? For example, do you only roast? Or do you have other responsibilities like bagging, front of house maintenance, ordering green coffee, managing wholesale accounts, etc. 

I currently roast for a coffee shop with two locations and roast ~400-600 pounds a week. I’m in charge of basically everything involving the roasting side of the business (everything listed in the above paragraph). 

I make $40k/year, no benefits, no PTO, and just trying to get some perspective on if I make a “normal” amount given my responsibilities.

1ox2ali,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ox2ali/the_plague_doctor_book_2_chapter_49_trial/,The Plague Doctor Book 2 Chapter 49 (Trial #???),"**Book 1**: (Desperate to save his son, Kenneth, a calm and nonviolent doctor accepts a deal offered to him by a strange creature. However, the price he must pay is to abandon everything he holds dear: his wife, children, and world as he attempts to share his knowledge of healing and medicine in a world entrenched by violence. Yet, in such a place, how long can his nonviolent nature remain if he wishes to survive?)

\*\*\*

For some time now, rumors had begun to circulate all throughout the village about these strange warming waters, or alcohol, of Kenneth’s creations, used as seasoning in the Grand Hall exclusively.

There had been a greater influx of people coming to join in partaking of this strange yet pleasant new taste, though the capacity for such a number did not easily fit, and for some time, people were turned away or barred from entering.

As far as Kenneth could tell, it went against certain Nok social customs, but what could you do when tradition meets limitations?

It was a question that took Nokuji a few days to answer, as she declared all to share in the bounty, only it would be done shiftingly, so, with people rotating, all except the commander’s, as per tradition, she had said.

To his ears, it had mostly sounded like privileged elitism to him, but everyone else seemed overjoyed, and partly dissatisfied, honestly, a swirl of emotions.

Regardless, Kenneth in truth found himself quite content with this new development. Less messy eating, and now Kolu didn’t have much of a reason not to sit at the table, so to speak.

Yes, he had introduced alcohol, and that would certainly be a problem eventually, but on the bright side, there were the previous perks, coupled with a boom in popularity, for him, which, coupled with stories of how he possessed the dreamer, and sensual, meant he could run the largest medicine trial as of yet.

With slight trepidation and excitement, Kenneth stepped forward to the crowd, his presence alone causing them all to slowly quiet down like a wave of silence originating from him.

He felt the wind outside as the sound of rushing water filled the vacant air and cleared his throat, “Welcome, I’m rather excited for you all to be joining me today for--”

‘What was the number on this medical trial again? Eh, no matter, I’ll figure it out later.’

“This latest medical trial, where we will continually test the medicinal qualities of mold! Now with such a great turnout, we will unfortunately be limited in the number of people we can have inside under observation and administration at a time, so we will have to separate you all into groups!” Kenneth loudly announced so all could hear it. “Now, anyone with injuries, where a yellow substance has appeared, please raise your hand and walk to my right.”

It never ceased to amaze him how orderly Nok seemed to instinctively be, people moving through the crowd and the crowd in turn making a path for them, moving and shifting like a wave.

“Okay, now anyone with injuries of any kind, please step to my left.”

The groups so far were uneavinly spread as was to be expected with only eight in the pus group, seven in the wounded group, and as far as he could count, about forty to fifty in the no wounds group.

‘Well, the room can house twenty, so I could be over in three rounds, guess I need to add some diversity,’ Kenneth concluded.

With a little bit of random pointing to people, he had managed to get his three groups of twenty each.

“Alright, phenomenal, we are almost ready to begin; however, there will be a slight change from my previous medical trials. After a long while watching and observing, my students will finally get some first-hand experience!” Kenneth gestured to Nokset and Nokoovo, standing to the side.

The crowd seemed to have noticed them before, and what attention they had paid them had been minimal, but now, after Kenneth told them they would be taking a more direct part, looks and whispers were, of course, shared. It was to be expected, of course, but he couldn’t just have them be on the sidelines or part of the trials forever; eventually, they would have to do stuff like this as well in the future.

At first, no one left right away, with the first group being welcomed in. It was only when Kenneth presented the lube, there were deserters, about five, but it was to be expected.

At least none of them were the ones with wounds.

Now was the time for a pop quiz.

Kenneth gathered Nokset and Nokoovo at his desk, where he had the syringes with the diluted allergy testened. “Alright, now’s the time, what do you do?”

“We give everyone the things in the needles,” Nokset casually said.

“Good, but walk me through it step by step,” Kenneth asked.

Nokoovo began to explain, “We take the syringe, then we--”

“No need, Nokoovo, I have confidence you know what to do, you transcribed that part exceptionally, but I need to hear it from you two Nokset.”

He sighed and rolled his eyes. “I take the sy-needle-thing with water in it, then press it at the bottom, stick it in, and press all the way.”

“Good, now can you tell me why we eject a little of the content before we stick it in?” Kenneth asked.

“Because you told me that’s how it’s done,” Nokset replied.

“Okay, listen and remember this well, we do it to remove all the air from the confined space, because you can’t let as much as a single bubble get into the bloodstream, or it could go straight to the heart, and that could be bad,” Kenneth said in a serious tone. “I want you both to remember every little step matters, and these little syringes could quite possibly carry the weight of an entire life, so I want you both to do this right, and if you even feel the slightest bit of hesitation, don't hesitate to call on me, understood.”

Both gave pause for a second.

He had in no uncertain terms told them all of this before, but to stand in the moment before you’d have to do it for your first time was something different; that, try as he might, Kenneth could only imagine, that fear and dread he first felt a long-buried memory at this point.

Nevertheless, they got to work carrying the tray with syringes, each numbered, along with the table each person sat at, so Kenneth could more easily determine which dose would potentially be of use.

Nokset, though understanding the assignment, did hesitate in the beginning. As a healer in this world's traditional sense, there was literally no way to fuck-up, or make a mistake; you could only do one thing, so now knowing that wasn’t the case, the weight of his actions had to be quite heavy.

Nokoovo, on the other hand, had no hesitation whatsoever. “Show me your hand.”

Unfortunately, it was a bit of the reverse with her, where the volunteering patients were hesitant; the first one she was at looked paler than her.

She hadn’t said in a threatening tone, but from the look on the guy she was asking to, she might as well have been carrying… well, she was carrying sharp objects, but bigger ones should have earned that reaction, especially not the desperate glances that were aimed his way.

But as long as she was doing everything correctly, there was no reason for Kenneth to step in; everyone else just had to see there was more to her than met the eye.

So, whether out of fear or compliance, the work was underway.

However, it was now Kenenth who watched most keenly of all, since this part would be the hardest, finding the vein. Human and Aki were quite easy in comparison to Nok, with their thick scales and discolored bodies; finding a simple vein was a challenge even with his years of experience.

Nokoovo pressed the syringe just enough that the contents squirted out ever so slightly, then she stuck it in, going parallel with the arm. Her gaze was focused, yet full of light, as she got it in the first go.

‘Excellent… well, she does have a little more practical experience finding a vein than most others,’ Kenneth thought, feeling a certain pride. ‘Well, let's see how Nokset is---”

“Arg! Are you trying to kill me!”

Kenneth walked over to see what the commotion was about. “So who’s dying?”

“I am!” Noktafily yelled in dissatisfaction.

“Oh, don’t mind this big shedling he’s crying for no reason,” Nokioloita laughed.

Oh, that didn’t sit well with him as he slammed his arm down on the table and thrust the other out for Kenneth to see. “See! This plebo has been stabbing me over and over!”

‘Oh, how nostalgic,’ Kenneth thought. “I see, my sincerest apologies, as I hope you remember this is Nokset’s first time injecting anyone with medication, so it is still a new experience for him. I hope you understand!”

“The only thing I understand is that this is the healer's fault!” 

“I see, so it’s my fault,” Kenneth said, his statement catching Noktafily and Nokset unawares. 

“What?! No, the other healer!” 

“Ooooh, I see, you mean Nokoovo,” Kenneth said, gesturing as she turned her head slightly at her name being mentioned. 

Noktafily could not have turned whiter faster while Nokioloita bellowed in laughter. 

It was a moment before he felt confident in yelling again. 

“No, I did not mean her, I meant him, this healer!” Noktafily pointed with his finger, nearly poking Nokset’s snout. 

“Oh, I see,” Kenneth said in fake understanding. “And what is his name again? I must be a bit more forgetful than you with this old nogging I got.” 

“What?!” 

“Oh, sorry, did I stutter?” Kenneth asked in a much more serious tone. “I simply asked you what his name is. I’ve mentioned it a couple of times now, and I’d think you at least had the decency to scream and complain using his name. Now, what healer did you have a problem with?” 

There was a moment of silence as Kenneth received a few odd looks. 

Then Noktafily stood and yelled, “I have a problem with this plebo Nokset and his hands jabbing me over and over.” 

With one second of silence between them, Kenneth replied, “I am so sorry Nokset has caused this pain. I would like you to stay, so would you permit one more try, or if not, someone with steadier hands can instead.” 

“Are you deaf? I don’t want Nokset doing it again!” 

“I see,” Kenneth replied. “ Nokoovo, would you be so kind as to come over—“

Noktafily quickly grabbed Kenneth and whisper-yelled, “Are you insane?! Not her anyone but her!”

“Did you want me to take over Nokset’s work?” Nokoovo asked. 

“No, my mistake, I misunderstood. Just keep doing great work on your side for now,” Kenneth praised her as he turned back to Nokset. “Well, you heard, give it another try.” 

At this point, Noktafily surely knew what Kenneth was doing, much from his hysterical laughing lifepartner, who at this point seemed to have lost her voice laughing silently, but regardless, he stuck out his hand. 

“Just as you practiced,” Kenneth told Nokset, guiding him with word-for-word instructions, all up until he inserted the needle and…

“Plebo!” 

“Another miss, well, it is what it is,” Kenneth said as he took over, getting it on the first try.

“Finally,” Noktafily grumbled. 

“Are you taking over now?” Nokset asked, his usual petulant tone nowhere to be found. 

“So you messed up, so what? Did you expect to be perfect on your first try?” Kenneth asked him as he handed him another needle. “The only way to get better is to try,  try, and try again.” 

He gestured to Nokioloita and never so quickly had anyone gone from laughter and smiles to frozen dread and fear, much to Noktafily’s delight. “Come now, you're a woman you're used to getting poked, more than me, and besides, he needs practice.” 

For the most part, all of the people Nokset attempted to inject seemed to end in failure, and the time he spent did seem to drag on until Kenneth stepped in. It would have been a long day, if not for Nokoovo moving through at a much… so to speak of, quicker pace. 

And once no one exhibited any negative reaction, the actual trial medication was to be given, with much the same result.

“I thank you all for your patience with both me and my students. I have noted your position along with the medication given, so would like you all to exit the building and please be nearby if any unfortunate incident were to occur, and if so, do not hesitate to call on me,” Kenneth asked of them and thanked them. 

With the hard part over, everyone did as instructed and left, whereupon group two was called in, this one having a few familiar faces in Nokkrik, her life partner Nokhofugh, Nokguvo, Mutiy, Bitie, Clingy, and of course Squeezy. 

He welcomed everyone in, explained what needed to be explained, and things went underway, but it was slow going, with Nokset still poking in the wrong places, and those who Nokoovo were with looked like they were getting mugged. 

Though there was a bit of an interesting development when Nokoovo reached Nokkrik, her gaze was firmly on her, but still she reached out her hand and let herself be injected with the syringe's contents, whereafter she said, “Thanks, Lord Obaliy, I barely felt any pain. I didn’t know you could be so gentle.” 

“Then I know I’ve done it correctly, similar to you builders, you can see a good from a bad structure, and acquired trait, and valuable,” Nokoovo replied.

‘Well, it seems a snowflake has fallen in hell,’ Kenneth noticed with a faint smile, before the pained hisses told him Nokset’s time was almost up.

Things were rather quiet, aside from the pained grunts all up until the end, where Kenneth would ask them to wait outside. 

“What about the poison!” Nokoojab or Bitie yelled, her sudden loudness getting a few stares her way, causing her to grow pale and sit down once more.. 

However, Nokemera did not have enough self-consciousness to be embarrassed as easily, “We sit through this, at least give us the chance like the other times! It’s the only reason we come here!” 

“I’m glad to see you're enthusiastic for advancing medical science,” Kenneth replied with a mix of sarcasm and earnestness. “However, I do believe I have gotten everything I need to know about poisons in my current possession.” 

More than half the room grew disappointed at the statement. 

“You couldn't have learned everything!” Nokemera insisted. 

“Well, ‘Everything’ is always going to be with an asterisk, I mean, I certainly didn’t think that the average Sil poison when diluted, and directly injected, would act as a slightly more potent local anesthetic,” Kenneth explained. “But a happy outcome nonetheless, likewise the shitter in small doses is a good laxative, and the poisons from the Sil in the slave pen I have confirmed to be among the many, are blood thinners, and surprisingly, insulin. However, I don’t think I was ever going to find a use for the pale death, with an increased dosage, even though it did seem to promote a nice shine to your scales, it would just be a beautiful death, if such a thing exists.” 

“But what will happen to the poison then?” Nokamber asked, her eyes wandering casually to the other room. 

“Well, after a break-in not too long ago, I decided to lock the important poisons away.” 

“Where?” Nokamber questioned, sounding more curious than anything. 

Humoring everyone a little, he obliged slightly, “I’ll give you all a clue or two. It’s in a place I know is secure, where no one can get to and only I can reach inside and pull them out.” 

For a moment, a few people looked thoughtful, Nokkrik son just sniggering to himself, his mother looking at Kenneth with slight bemusement, their reaction much to his confusion until Muity said what everyone was probably thinking. “Your tailless hole.”

“…”

“Yes, of all places I could hide important, deadly poisons, my asshole was the best possible choice, and not my magical bag,” Kenneth said with more sarcasm than he had ever summoned in his entire life. 

“Magic bag?” Nokhakkie said with a healthy bit of skepticism. “What’s magic about it, that you can fit inside it?” 

“Oh, nothing special, just the ability to store and reshape items I put into it,” Kenneth replied nonchalantly, keeping the lie consistent. 

“Magic, huh?” Nokguvo muttered. “Not only a rumor someone else made up.” 

“Could I borrow my bag for a moment?” Kenneth asked Split, to which she obliged. “Well, in lieu of poison, how about magic?” 

True magicians used sleight of hand, optical illusions, that sort of thing. Kenneth just stuck his hand into his bag and pulled out anything and everything that was a miraculous tool or medical-related, all from scalpels, drugs, and a tiny wheelchair, leaving the crowd in awe, most of whom didn’t seem to notice Nokoovo or Nokset as they made the rounds. 

However, there were disbelievers, strangely enough, considering magic was a common word here. 

“Prove this is really magic and pull out a sword,” Nokemera demanded. 

“A sword, hmm… well, that is a bit outside of what I can do,” Kenneth admitted, the doubters smugly smiling in their victory. “However, I can pull out something as frightening.” 

With not a moment wasted, Kenneth pulled out a comically giant syringe. 

“Now, who’s next in line?” Kenneth jokingly asked. “No one is raising their arm. Oh well.” 

Then he packed it down into the bag for it to disappear. 

“How did you do that?” Nokoovo curiously asked, most others too stunned to speak. 

“Magic, no other word for it,” if anything, he understood it less than they did. 

“And here I thought it was only rumors, but what do ya know,” Nokguvo half-chuckled. 

“I never knew magic like that existed,” Nokkrik said excitedly, though she seemingly kept her composure as she turned to her lifepartner. “Do you think if we ask, he would perform at Nokartso’s hatching party… are you well?” 

That last bit of the conversation caught Kenneth's attention as he looked up to see Nokhofugh, his face looking swollen. 

‘Shit, allergic reaction,’ Kenneth thought as he rushed up to him quickly pulling out an eppie-pen; however, before he was within arm's reach, he noticed something strange. ‘Shouldn’t he be panicking?’ 

Within reach, Kenneth stopped up and asked, “Are you okay?” 

He didn’t speak, but nodded yes. 

“Okay, just a moment, I’ll see what’s happening,” though Kenneth knew damn well what was happening, and his inspection only revealed it to be a severe allergic reaction, his throat completely closed. “Okay, question, why aren’t you struggling to breathe? Let me rephrase: why do you seem fine without air?” 

“Oh, it’s only been a short while; he can hold it much longer.” 

“How much longer?” 

“Much longer than this,” Nokkrik said nonchalantly. 

“How fascinating, I must admit, never imagined this as a possibility, but it does make sense for water-loving creatures such as you lot to be able to hold their breath for much longer than me,” Kenneth said in astonishment, utterly fascinated by the possibilities. “Well, this does put an allergic reaction a bit down on the danger scale. I wonder if you even need help, or if it will pass on its own?” 

“Ya make him sound special,” Nokguvo said. “He ain't nothing but mediocre.”

The comment must have hit hard because Nokhofugh hit her back even harder.

“Why ya standing, a tap like that ain't worth getting up for.”

Kenneth would have never imagined seeing someone having an allergic reaction getting into a heated brawl, but life's full of surprises, even now as Nokkrik slapped the pair squarely across their snouts. “You know not to antagonize him, apologize, and Hofugh, you know you can't beat her.”

Looking more like a child than a grown woman, Nokguvo let out a sighing hiss, “Sorry for calling you mediocre, but that don’t mean ya special.”

“He might not be special to you, but if I were in his position, I would already be dead,” Kenneth interjected. “I must say I find myself a bit jealous of such an impressive lung capacity.” 

“Oh, stop, you’ll make him white,” Nokkrik said lovingly. 

“If I hadn’t before, I will now,” Kenneth said as he jammed the eppie-pen into his exposed shoulder. After a moment of shock and panic, Nokhofugh could finally voice his disapproval, and a moment later, breathed in again. 

“Oh, I definitely feel better,” Nokhofugh said, grabbing his head and sitting down. “Is the room spinning, jiggling sideways, and did it suddenly get hot?” 

“Is he fine?” Nokkrik asked worriedly. 

“No need to fret, a faster heartbeat and dizziness are to be expected; he should be fine after a while, but he can’t participate in the trial, too dangerous for him.” 

“What did ya stab him with?” 

“Hmm, how to describe it,” Kenneth wondered. “You know that feeling when you get hit and are in pain, then suddenly you aren’t any longer, having kind of forgotten it?”

Nokguvo smiled because if any species should know the feeling, it would be Nok. “What of it?” 

“It’s that.” 

“Huh…? What ya mean?” 

“Just what I said, I injected him with that.” 

“Are you saying you injected him with a feeling?” Nokoovo interjected, looking to not quite believe what she herself was suggesting. 

“Well, I call it adrenaline, but I suppose you could call it that,” Kenneth replied. All in the room looked stunned at him. “What’s this? Don’t be so surprised, I mean, considering the sensual, something like this shouldn’t be too abnormal.” 

“One thing is the sensual…” Nokset piped up, growing slightly darker, with a couple of jealous looks as he made his way. “Another is… is that.” 

“Can you do other emotions?” Nokoovo asked intently.  

“Well, we all have a lot of time on our hands, and since all look to be interested, so why don’t I teach on the subject at hand?” Kenneth suggested, not hearing ‘no’ from any. 

And thus began his explanation of emotions and hormones, all the while Nokset and Nokoovo injected the medication into the volunteers. Kenneth explained the basics about how each and every emotion originated from the brain, something a lot of people couldn't really wrap their heads around, given that they felt what they felt where they thought it was. 

It was a mixed bag of uncertainty, stubbornness, and contemplation that lasted all the way up until the final group was to enter. 

This one only had one person Kenneth knew by name, Noksafgro, who was being carried in by three guards and placed on a table; everyone else was just people he had seen here and there, not one’s he really knew all that well. 

“Guess you are in luck,” Kenneth told Nokset. “If anyone won’t complain about you jabbing them with a needle, it's him.” 

It was about to get started, and of course, there were the deserters only here for lube, but after everyone got to work, Nokoovo, as the previous time, led the way, and Nokset used Noksafgro as a pin cussion. 

Everything was going fine and dandy with Nokset seeming to continuously fail, and Nokoovo scaring the living day light out of any she approached, but progress was being made. 

For now, Kenneth just waited and watched as a new development happened in the form of the hunter commander Nokmao, and a couple of her underlings, who all carried plants, a couple with berries on them, entered. 

“A little earlier than expected, but you can just put the plants in the corner,” Kenneth pointed out. 

Nokmao motioned for her subordinates to do so, barely looking at Kenneth, or even Split for that matter. 

The same, however, could not be said for Nokalsia, the person who had carried his back when he had been out foraging with the hunters.

“Hello disgrace,” a quick greeting followed by a quick but too powerful slap that she just took, while everyone else did and said nothing, well, Kenneth sure as shit wouldn’t let something like that pass silently; however, surprisingly, he was not the first to speak.

“Pathetic, a disgrace like her isn’t worth anyone’s time,” Nokmao said calmly and coldly, much to the other hunters and most everyone’s confusion.

“Huh…? But, Commander, you always…” Nokalsia began only to stop and lighten as Nokmao’s eyes connected.

“Are you calling me pathetic?”

“…No!”

Without any further words, Nokmao left, though not before, as she walked by him, pulling on Nokset’s tail, causing him to suddenly straighten in surprise. 

Kenneth would have called her out on that if not for how she looked back at Nokset with a smile. His understanding of emotion had grown a great deal since his arrival at this village, and though he still struggled with the subtle nuances of emotions and subtle body language, her smile didn’t seem mocking, more so playful, or teasing, a theory corroborated by Nokset's expression, looking slightly embarrassed, while his scales darkened.  

Just to make sure everything was alright, Kenneth walked over to him, making a surprising discovery: “Looks like you got it.” 

Nokset's head suddenly snapped down, and he looked as if he didn’t quite believe himself, even as he injected the syringe's contents. 

Though a mistake, or chance, it had shown him it was possible, invigorating him a bit, and getting it right two and a half times more, before today’s trials had come to an end.

Once the room was empty and the work was over, he took a seat at his desk and let out a sigh, “Well, that was an interesting day, wouldn’t you both say?”

Nokset was leaning against a wall with a distant look, while Nokoovo was sitting at a nearby table, both looking in thought for a moment.

“It was something different,” Nokoovo said, clearly a lot more on her mind, though that was all she could or would say at the moment, her scales ever so slightly darkening.

“I didn’t know you knew my name,” Nokset commented, looking at Nokoovo. Their gazes met for a moment, longer than normal, before both looked away from one another.

“It’s been said so many times, so of course I would.”

Neither chose to leave for now, both just taking a moment to catch their breath.

As a reward for a job well done, he got some alcohol from the bag and a couple of cups, pouring some for both. “After today, I think you two have earned this.”

Nokset smelled the cup and then poured half of it down in one go, growing more relaxed by the moment. “So is this how it is, being yelled at, unless you are perfect?”

“It can be that way sometimes, you end up getting the meanest and angriest person in the world, who does nothing but complain at you and about you,” Kenneth replied in a calm, understanding tone. “But it’s only a few, so don’t let a bad apple spoil the bunch. When in this profession, you get to meet a bunch of people, some angry, others afraid, and those who will die. I do hope both of you are prepared for that.”

Nokoovo looked a bit hesitant as if she wanted to say something, but Nokset beat her to it, not hesitating for even a moment, “Do you know how many have died, because I was healing someone else or couldn’t anymore. I’ve heard them shout, cry, and beg… I’m more than prepared.”

“Perhaps you are,” Kenneth admitted. “But will you say the same when you tell someone they’ll die and all you are met by isn’t fear, anger, or despair, but calm acceptance, maybe even slight joy.”

This got both of their attention, Nokset finishing his drink, and Nokoovo downing hers in one go, Kenneth joining them and finishing his own.

“If there’s one thing I’ve learned when it comes to medicine and healing, it’s expect the unexpected, especially when it comes to people. They can surprise you in many ways, so a word of advice, be prepared for anything.”

“You make being a healer like you sound less and less appealing by the moment,” Nokset commented.

Kenneth let out a halfhearted chuckle. “ I do, don’t I? So have I scared you of it, with this little taste?”

“Of course not,” Nokoovo said without hesitation.

Nokset, on the other hand, only crossed his arms and stared at Kenneth for a moment, “I didn’t know I had a choice in the matter. Eh… I’ve come this far, might as well.”

“Cheers,” Kenneth said, pouring them all another drink.

It had already taken effect in Nokoovo and Nokset, and while they didn’t have a flush in their cheeks, their scales, on the other hand, were slowly becoming darker. However, they didn’t seem to notice as they chucked another cup and one more, all three just sitting there in silence.

Though that silence signaled that everything was finally over, and now quick little footsteps filled the air.

With an excited, “Papa.” Nokstella jumped up, reaching halfway up his knees, trying to climb up.

“Let me give you a hand there,” Kenneth sweetly said, lifting her up as out of the corner of his eye, Kolu came walking with a bit of quickness in his step, yet it was measured and a bit more controlled. “So how was your day?”

“Boring Papa.”

“There are only so many games where I win, and times we can hide as she finds me,” Kolu said, sounding like he’d been through an ordeal, but he was hiding it as a child could, not that Nokstella seemed to notice.

“Well, I’m sorry, we had a lot of people today, but how about we head down,” Kenneth suggested. “You can see some of your other friends, Nokstella, and Kolu; you can have the fun of beating everyone in Nest.”

Children had a hard time hiding their excitement, and those two were no different.

Though eventually he noticed lingering eyes on him from his two students, Nokset was more so only looking; however, Nokoovo was staring.

“Well, you two, I guess I’ll be heading down,” Kenneth said, standing up and putting Nokstella down. “I’ll leave you with the bottle, if you want a little more, but don’t drink too much, you both have work in the morning, with this many volunteers, we need to be ever more vigilant and monitor their health.”

“Y-yes,” Nokoovo was quick to say. Nokset, on the other hand, used it to wave dismissively.

In some ways, being responsible for Nokstella and Kolu afforded him a reason to, in a manner of speaking, rest when he needed to, as far as he’d seen, compared to most others, he was working the hardest, at least in regards to time committed to his workload.

The very next day, Kenneth was up bright and early, awoken by the angry cook who took him away; however, after his morning bath and breakfast, he was ready to see if there were results, waiting for people to gather. 

Diligent as ever, Nokoovo was the first to enter, surprisingly alongside Nokset, both looking a bit worse for wear. 

“Rough night,” Kenneth asked. 

“Urg, how can your voice be this annoying?” Nokset groaned.

“Have we been poisoned?” Nokoovo questioned. 

“You know, with two livers I would have imagined you’d both have a high enough tolerance for half a bottle, but you live and you learn, I mean, I did warn you,” Kenneth said as he walked into the other room and took off the salted meat. “Just what the doctor prescribed, salt and fat. Also, drink some water, it’ll help.” 

“Thank you, but could you please be quiet?” Nokoovo asked, before biting down and swallowing, bones and all. 

“Must be bad,” Kenneth commented in a lower voice. “Hope neither of you did something you’ll regret today.” 

Suddenly, both of them froze like a deer in headlights, Nokset, reflexively swallowing. 

‘What did they drunkenly hook up or something? Well, it ain’t my business, so better move on before they suspect me of knowing anything.’

“Well, eat and get ready. The first group should be arriving any time.” 

Salt, fat, and water worked their wonders in combating their hangover, going from looking like the people who you shouldn’t talk to until they had their goddamn coffee, to the ones who had sipped it for five minutes. 

And it was right on time as group one stepped inside and, as per Kenneth's instructions, took their seats precisely where they sat yesterday. 

He asked the standard questions. “How are you feeling? Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary, good or bad? Any soreness, swelling, or tightness in the throat?” 

That last one wasn't as relevant with Nok, but still, it should be asked. 

‘Alright, number 6,’ Kenneth tapped his pencil on his note block, ready to write as he asked the questions, and finished off with a physical examination near the infected area. “Everything in normal order, nothing of note, and infected area, same if not progressing, specimens number, five hundred and six, ineffective.” 

“Quit yabbing and look over here, I’m better,” Noktafily yelled across the room. 

Well, that was one way to get Kenneth’s attention. He briskly walked over, like he was approaching a cake, calm, like a measured adult, while inside his inner child fought for him to run. “Okay, so have you—“ 

“Are you deaf?!” Noktafily yelled. “I told you it’s gone.” 

He thrust his wounded arm up into Kenneth’s face, and it is true, the slight infection there had been before is now gone. “That is excellent.” 

“So, have you finally found it?” Nokoovo asked with excitement in her voice. 

“If it means I can go to sleep, say yes as loudly as you want,” Nokset said. 

“Well, as I said, it’s excellent, and definitely good news, but I can’t be certain,” Kenneth said. “For all I know, it could be a result of the immune system getting a boost, eating a particular organ, or simply a delayed response from the immune system.” 

“So what are you saying?” Nokset asked with desperation in his voice. 

“Well, the short of the long of it is, this is the most promising we've seen yet; however, we still have to finish and see if any other had similar responses to the same dose. Then, if a pattern begins to emerge after some more trial with no side effects to speak of, then we might have something useful,” Kenneth explained. 

“You are making that up to punish me again, right?” Nokset asked, desperation turned to despair. 

“Trust me, im no fan of this part either,” Kenneth admitted. “However, there is nothing but to get started.”

I feel it's important at this point to reiterate we were only ever friends nothing more. Over time we lost touch.

I said oh yes we used to be quite close we'd go out on work events etc. He then went on to ask what happened between us, I told him nothing he wouldn't believe me.

Now you have a unhinged post that tries to attach me to certain accounts. 

There is no report/theory of a mental patient prior to me, so that's a lie. The user goes on to claim I shared an AI generated photo, which, if I did, that wasn't on purpose. However, this user introduced themselves as a supporter of mine, and I got red flag vibes right away. Obviously, their post proves me right. I am not Unihorror, haha. This is an account on X known for stealing word for word tweets. Bucky_leak is blocked, so that was another swing and a miss from this user. 

I did not theorize about a mental patient just for a bigger channel 3Cfilms to report on it months later. I did not theorize about the Macher house returning just for it to appear in the trailer. I did not theorize about a school play only for it also to be in Scream 7. I did not theorize this placeholder (https://x.com/CriticalOverlo3/status/1894772548073590868?t=RoFVSu_mH172BPSTg4B_Kw&s=19) plot that reveals Sidney runs a coffee shop.

We normally buy matcha and hojicha tea powder online but that has become pretty expensive with the rising demand and they have been sold out constantly making it hard to enjoy it consistently.

 Finding a place that sells high quality Matcha and Hojicha tea powder here would really make my day. I have tried the Asian markets and nearby health specialty stores and no luck. I feel like I am not looking in the right spot and there surely has to be a tea stockist somewhere even in the surrounding states?

1ox1z97,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketMoneyOfficial/comments/1ox1z97/feature_friday_organize_your_spending_with/,Feature Friday: Organize your spending with transaction rules,"Happy Friday! With the holidays approaching and your to-do list growing, time is more precious than ever. That's why today's Feature Friday spotlights one of Rocket Money's most powerful time-saving features: transaction rules.

**What are transaction rules?**

Transaction rules automatically categorize and edit your transactions based on criteria you set. Instead of manually updating every transaction that comes through, you can create rules that handle the repetitive work. Set them once, and they'll keep working in the background to keep your budget organized.

**How transaction rules save you time**

If you’re tired of categorizing every coffee run, you can create a rule that automatically sorts any transaction containing ""Starbucks"" or ""Coffee"" into your ""Coffee Shops"" custom category. That way, you can track your caffeine spending without the manual work.

You can also set up rules based on amount. For example, you can mark all transactions over $500 as ""Tax Deductible"" to make tax season or budget reviews easier. No more digging through months of transactions to find those bigger expenses when you need them.

**How to set up transaction rules in Rocket Money**

On mobile:

1. Tap the **Settings** (⚙️) icon in the upper left corner of the **Dashboard**
2. Select **Categories, Tags & Rules**
3. Tap on the **Rules** tab

My husband is the total opposite of frugal. If I leave things up to him he’ll find the most expensive and least effective solution to any problem, eats out/orders takeout/food delivery multiple times a week, buys lunch at work everyday, buys coffee and pastry most mornings, thinks ready to eat meals is cooking, shops at fancy shops, doesn’t look at prices or check till slips when shopping, doesn’t wait for specials on things that are regularly on promotion, likes the latest gadgets, always calling someone instead of trying to fix problems around the house, using a financial advisor when both of us are financial professionals… and the list goes on.

I’m at my wits end. I live frugally, am happy with simplicity, and need and want very little so my personal expenses are low. I save a substantial portion of my income and have been investing it successfully. To me financial independence and living life on my terms is more important than having stuff and spending on luxuries that don’t mean much to me. I’m in my 40s and can afford to be semi retired. So right now I’m stay at home and running a small business to keep busy while he hates his job. I have to carry half the household expenses so part of the inefficient spending falls on me. Besides the sharing of household expenses, we manage our own money and have separate bank accounts. We don’t have kids. He thinks I nag (I don’t!) and gets irritated when I ask him to reconsider a spending choice to either eliminate or look at better value alternatives. He complains he doesn’t have money even though he works a high paying job. I was earning a similar salary when I was still working. I’d love to be in charge of and making decisions about the household expenses but he thinks he knows better than me.

When we got married I didn’t consider that our values towards money aren’t aligned and how it could cause me so much unhappiness. I wish I’d chosen differently but after being together for over 20 years, that ship has long sailed. We’re supposed to be working as a team towards a common goal, but instead I feel like we’re pulling in different directions financially and it negatively affects other aspects of our marriage. How do I coax him into working with me at least a little? How do I get to a middle ground where I can accommodate his non-frugal ways and my frugality at the same time?",63,1763139487.0,Frugal,93,0.77,False

1ox1yr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1ox1yr5/2_months_off_zyn_and_discouraged/,2 Months Off Zyn and Discouraged,"First, some back story  
Been on Nicotine in some shape or form since 17 starting with cigarettes and graduating to dip when my college campus went smoke free sophomore year.  Used dip through college and slowed down once I graduated and got into the job market.  From there I switched to nicotine replacement therapy using gum and lozenges for several years until 2020 when I noticed Zyn nicotine pouches.  I started using those and early on was hooked, gave that same buzz feeling from Dip.  What a mistake.  Got really heavy into Zyn over the past two years once work and life became stressful.  Energy drinks and one to two cups of coffee a day and work stress became so great that I ended up getting diagnosed with Shingles 3 months ago, now this is where things get really bad.  Was prescribed prednisone and valtrex to help nock out the shingles but once I began, my heart rate became out of this world and started getting extreme brain fog, fatigue, restlessness, trouble focusing my eyes, and odd ear heaviness and pain with my hearing fluctuating in both ears with tinnitus.  I found this subreddit and found many others reporting similar issues.  Once I ran out of my last can I stopped once I stopped taking the other meds.

Now to present day  
My ears and hearing are doing better, my heart isn't racing and back down to a normal level but my BP is still off and on high.  I've increased my fluid intake and given up energy drinks, I still drink a cup of coffee in the morning and some green tea in the afternoon but by brain fog and trouble focusing eyes is still present.  I've been to my PC and ENT a few times now, all blood tests and ear exams come back normal.  My doctor noted my BP is still a bit high but wants to continue to monitor before putting me on meds.   I've noticed recently that I feel like there's a pulsating sensation in the head and lower legs and feet but they are note physically shaking.  I really have not idea what is going on with me but I am curious if I should now give up Caffeine entirely to give my nervous system a complete reset.  

I enjoy the gym and lifting weights but have been lightheaded and just not felt good at all when at the gym.  The whole thing is discouraging, I have not desire to go back to Nicotine. ",1,1763139458.0,QuittingZyn,3,1.0,False

Okay so, for some background I’m a college student in the US if that helps set the scene. My question is: as a Christian, how should I navigate spending money, especially on things that aren’t at all necessary. There’s things I enjoy spending money on that aren’t nearly as important as for example making sure someone else has a warm meal, but by that same logic am I supposed to never enjoy anything physical that’s not an absolute necessity? Is it selfish to treat yourself at times when there’s people out there without homes and food? I’m interested to know how some other Christian’s view the matter and act on it. 
Here are some examples so you kind of get what I mean: 
1. I love to grab a coffee with friends or as a little treat, but it’s not a need. 
2. I love to paint my nails or sometimes go get them done once in a while, even though it’s not necessary 
3. What about things like going out for ice cream, a snack, a drink with friends, or meals? 
4. And lastly, how do you view those bigger, once in a blue moon activities, such as a day trip, going on vacation, going to a concert, etc.? 
I would love to hear your input, opinions, and most of all biblical evidence on this. Thank you kindly!

After seeing those two ""Synergize"" in many walkthroughs, playthroughs, etc, I can't help but wonder what kinda setup they have between each other. My personal headcanon is that Malevola basically serves as an Older Sister figure to Herm. Like, I can see her being forced to work alongside him so much and becoming protective and caring and concerned. !<  
  
>!Like, maybe she just pulls his ass aside by the ear after one mission where they had to take on the Red Ring and just scolds him directly for one reason or another, in that stern but caring way older siblings do. And she'd be surprised at herself, too! Like, she's desperate to just scream diatribes in his face like she'd do to anyone else, but she just can't do it! XD !<  
  
  
>!My reasons for imagining this wholesome AF bond probably stem from Episode 8 when Phenomaman joins the Z-team. For those who *foolishly* chose the former over the latter back in Episode 4, if you go with Waterboy first and then have Phenomaman join the team 4 episodes later, Herm basically goes on a fanboy tangent, overjoyed to be working with the Dispatch Universe's equivalent of Superman. After which, Mal tells the deeply-depressed hero: ""Waterboy's very excited to work with you."" in this subtly affectionate, clearly advocating tone that I just couldn't ignore.!<  
  
  
So, yeah. That's where I stand with those two: Nothing sexual or romantic, just pure, sibling-coded wholesomeness between a badass, RPG sword-wielding demoness with an Aussie accent, and a socially awkward, perpetually damp, anxious aah janitor turned superhero with the purest heart of anyone in the game. In my mind, Mal probably buys Herm snacks and coffee from the breakroom for no real reason and lends an ear when there's no one else around to hear...or *willing* to.   
  
She seems like the kind of person who frequently lets him crash at her place, where she lets him stay up till 11 streaming shit his parents probably **still** don't let him watch! Also, NGL, she's **definitely** plotting to go full Tickle Monster on him at *some* point...She's just waiting for the perfect time so that no one on the Z-Team can mercilessly rib her ass for it. :P

I want to get the independent specialty coffee shop experience at home. My budget is £800 but I am willing to increase it slightly if it means better quality results.

My drink of choice is a flat white with oat milk and tend to have two coffees per day. I make coffee for friends and family when visiting and they mostly drink milk based coffees such as latte and cappuccino, with some drinking americano.

I was initially going to buy the Sage Barista Express (£500) but after a lot of research on coffee forums, it seems that the concensus is to buy a separate grinder to ensure better quality end product.

Based on that, I have looked at getting the Eureka Mignon Zero (£200), DF54 V3 (£180) or Bartaza Encore ESP (£160) alongside Lelit Anna (£510) or Gaggia Classic Evo (£400). I am not really keen on the Sage Bambino Plus.

A little about me: 
- I am extremely introverted and socially awkward. 
- I hate crowds or over stimulating environments (I literally have to sit in my car for 20 minutes and convince myself to get out to buy groceries).
- unfortunately, I am still figuring out who I am but my hobbies include, hiking, sight seeing, reading and grabbing a coffee at a corner cafe where nobody ever seems to visit. 
- I like Neo soul, 90s hip hop and Lofi sounds.
- I have a secret obsession with true crime, the psychology of it all. 
- I recently got laid off due to company closure so I am in that awkward stage where I am waiting for that acceptance letter, eating away my savings and having those weird calls with my dad where he is offering encouragement and support. 
- … I think that’s about it really. 😂

1ox1v8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1ox1v8m/how_keeping_one_dumb_promise_fixed_my_motivation/,How Keeping One Dumb Promise Fixed My Motivation,"for years i told myself i needed to be more focused  
more organized  
more consistent

but all of that was just code for “i don’t trust myself”  
and i didn’t  
because deep down, i kept making promises i knew i wouldn’t keep

i’d plan ideal days  
say “this week will be different”  
then break it quietly, again and again

what actually changed me wasn’t some tool or system  
it was the decision to stop lying to myself

i started small  
kept promises so tiny they felt stupid  
“i’ll drink one glass of water before checking my phone”  
“i’ll write one sentence after my coffee”  
no drama  
no bargaining  
just proof

eventually that proof became identity

my new rule is:

* never promise what you won’t *definitely* do
* track completions, not intentions
* say things out loud that you’re scared to admit
* lower the bar until it’s laughably doable
* stack the wins in public or on paper

the first week felt weirdly quiet  
like my brain stopped arguing with itself for once  
just one glass of water  
just one sentence  
but i *did* it

one idea from [NoFluffWisdom](https://NoFluffWisdom.com/subscribe) helped lock it in:  
""confidence is just the memory of kept promises""

1ox1r7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_sophisticaden-/comments/1ox1r7k/a_final_letter_to_a_first_love/,A Final Letter to a First Love,"N,

For six months, I have held on to you. When I first found out you cheated, I begged my parents not to hate you. I begged to see the good in you, to understand you, to defend you, to still love you. I believed that you had lost a self that could be found again.

But you never had a self. I remember all those nights I expressed my fears of being a void: a black hole, something that sucked everything up. But that was you. The person I knew never existed; there never *was* a Natalie. You flit from one narrative to the next -- you choose a storyline, an obsession, and you commit to it wholly until you get bored. You give it up, you hurt people, you move on.

I lived through so many of those narratives. How long will the personality you stole from me last? When will you get bored of being the pick-me football girl? When will you admit you didn't even know what football *was* until we were years into our relationship, and that your entire fascination for football was solely a means for you to solicit attention? When will you admit that you were a *parasite,* taking every thing I said, every word I spoke, every feeling I felt, making it yours, and writing it out of the picture?

You are so terrified of being a person. You are terrified to be a real person. You are terrified to be Natalie. So you were the coffee girl. Then you were the politics girl. But, oh, you got bored of that. For a while you were the partner, right? The perfect, doting person. Then you became the football girl.

Then, in what I think is your most evil act, you became the girl who went on that subreddit. You became the girl for whom extramarital affairs was your kink (your words, though you deny them; not mine). That became your whole personality. Once again, you stole from me; you stole our impending marriage, and you used it to solicit so many men that Reddit banned you for spam.

In the following months, you have accused me of so many things. You accused me of stealing. You lied and told your affair partner that I broke your laptop (does that ever fill you with shame, knowing that I've never and could never harm you, but that you would so easily tell another person I could? What other lies have you told about me?).

You are a **coward.** You can do nothing but run from the fear of who and what you are. And you'll keep running, keep getting bored, and keep hurting yourself -- and twenty years from now, you'll wonder how you wound up just like your sister.

For six months I have felt insane. I have felt like a *psycho.* I have felt like I've deserved all this hurt.

But do you know what I've learned? From every person I've shared these details to?

*That you were bad for me. That I was not in the wrong.*

My friends. The few strangers I've trusted with this. The two strangers who comforted me when I thought I wanted to kill myself. My parents. My therapist.

All of them see you for what you are. They recognize your emptiness, your vapidity, your manipulation. Every single one of them -- my therapist especially -- has told me how imperative it is that I never contact you again.

At some point you will try to wriggle back in my life. Probably when you get bored of the football persona. Or maybe when you see me being happy, finding joy, bringing joy to other people. You'll try to contact me. You'll confess how sorry you are.

And I will not take you back. I will not let you back into my life. Since October, you have done some of the vilest things you could do to a person who trusted you, and cared for you, and gave thousands of dollars and tens of thousands of hours and hundreds of thousands of hugs and kisses.

And you'll turn this back around on me, if you ever read it, just like you turned it around on me at other points. But I am not a psycho. I am not manipulative. I am not controlling. I did not take more than my half of the money. It was not *my fault* that you cheated -- my feelings were not too much for you to handle. I was not the bad guy when I tried to hold you to your promise that you would pay for breaking the lease for the home in Madison. I was not the villain, and words can never express the anger and anguish I feel because you have planted that in my head.

I hope, one day, you actually face the mirror. I hope one day you finally stop pretending -- I hope you can look at yourself and see someone, and not a persona you've crafted. These fake people you pretend to be will never be enough. They will never satisfy you.

For so long, I held your failure against you. I faulted you for failing to do something I believed you were capable of. I understand now that, presently, you are simply incapable of being a genuine human being. You cannot ever be yourself. I hope that changes.

I loved you unconditionally. I know what you will bring up when I say that - you will mention the things I've said since we broke up, the ways that I have lashed out. You are right that those statements do not reflect the love I had for you. But I would have supported you through anything. If you had chosen to reveal any part of the truth, I would have stood by you. But how could you? You hid smoking, you hid a second Snapchat, you hid the men you talked to, you hid thousands of dollars of debt, you hid failing school and you hid struggling the second time. You hid your eating disorder, you hid the men you solicited in October, you hid me from them. You hid more things than I can count and than I can recall. It's no wonder you couldn't take it any more.

Thank you for the memories. Find your own fucking personality.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks.

We met in the summer and discovered that we had mutual acquaintances. I was in the process of quitting my old job and moving to her city. Not because of her, but coincidentally she also lives here. She was away a lot and we saw each other less often, but the connection between us was intense. We texted and talked on the phone  every day and made plans for trips. I was very fond of her, the conversations were great, and I thought I had finally found someone with whom I could have a relationship on equal terms. I was in love i guess. When she spontaneously went to a festival with some old friends of mine, I got scared that they would tell her about my past. When she came back, I was upset and told her everything. A few days later, she became distant and ended everything. She didn't want to give me a second chance. From that moment on, we had sporadic contact and met for coffee. After that, I asked her if there could be more for her, as I still had strong feelings for her. She said she wanted to try friendship for now. It was a big misunderstanding at the time, but she closed herself off very quickly and became cold, which is why I think she is an avoidant. We haven't had any contact for 20 days.  Somehow, I feel like I need to explain myself again. I was inconsolable and cried a lot. It was perhaps traumatic. But I see potential between her and me.

I thought if I asked local businesses for a donation through the school’s nonprofit, we’d get a few things to help…

Y’all. The businesses really stepped up, and I’m so proud of this city right now. I wanted to use this space to thank them all for supporting our kids! To note, other businesses may have contributed things to other baskets - these are the businesses that helped me personally!

1ox1o2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/RS_Sandwiches/comments/1ox1o2u/best_breakfast_catering_ideas_for_melbourne/,Best Breakfast Catering Ideas for Melbourne Offices,"Breakfast catering is becoming a go-to for Melbourne workplaces—especially for early kick-off meetings and team training days. A good breakfast spread mixes both light and hearty options because everyone eats differently in the morning. Think mini sandwiches, pastries, seasonal fruit, yoghurt cups, egg dishes, and a couple of hot items like hash browns or sautéed mushrooms.

Melbourne teams always appreciate healthier options too, so including vegetarian, high-protein, and dairy-free choices goes a long way. And honestly, the biggest hack? Pair your catering with good coffee. Melburnians are picky—so good batch brew or barista-style coffee can completely lift the vibe of a morning event.

Breakfast catering also helps boost attendance for early sessions, which is why companies keep using it.

AI is in a bubble relative to what? Cash fiat currency? are you kidding me?

The gov and the oligarchs have trained to common man to value everything in fiat and thats exactly how they maintain the system. SPY is up %90 in the last 5 years so what? have you looked around how much are houses up in the last 5 years? cars? land? coffee? bitcoin? Hell even my toilet paper is probably up more than the SPY in the last 5 years relative to fiat so its probably fair to say that the SPY is under performing toilet paper in the last 5 years.

If you wanna know if something is a real bubble you need to compare that thing to other real assets and Cash/fiat is not a real asset. so if you are trying to see if SPY is in a bubble check how many SPY shares you needed to sell to buy and avg house in the US in 2020 vs how many SPY shares you need to see to buy an avg house in the US today or do spy vs gold spy vs bitcoin etc. the idea to use fiat as the constant unit to compare everything against is ridiculous and only done by goons and clowns. fiat is the most inconstant easily manipulated asset in existence controlled by a bunch of boomers and politicians who barely  know what plant they live on.

Currently all leading economical, political and social indicators point at one thing only and that is govs around the world are about to engage in a massive gloabl monetary expansion probably bigger than 2008 and covid era combined. I have been trading since 2011 everything from stocks to FXs to commodities. and have been through many ups and downs but never in have seen so many bullish signs as we are seeing now. ignoring week to week fluctuations.  This market has literally no where to go but up for the next 18 months at least. and just stocks, everything is going up stocks houses crypto gold everything and anything is going up. outside maybe and thats a big maybe, the only thing I could see going down are things that will see massive efficiency/productivity gains from AI. and that would be services mainly.

My  advice to everyone is stop being a goon and holding on to your cash cause you are waiting for the market crash. go and buy something with it i dont care what you buy and does not have to be stocks and could be toilet paper if you want still better than holding cash.  and STOP LISTENING TO MICAHAEL BURRY and other goons who keep saying the market will crash

look at toilet paper chart below and compare to spy,, Maybe tell Michael burry to open a 1B short position on toilet paper

But y’all please be careful when it’s dark, cars and pedestrians.

 (For other drivers including myself apparently).. be super careful on north garden street, I’ve been hit not like ped vs car buttt, car v car  on this street and the visibility is just so bad, especially when it’s dark. And these new LED lights are insane and super blinding like i genuinely cant see 80% of time. But moral of the story be careful, not sure why the city hasn’t done more on this street for pedestrians I see people almost get hit daily! ",25,1763138198.0,Bellingham,3,0.84,False

tried 3 designers. spent $1200 total. none got what I wanted.

designer 1 ($300): said I want authentic Italian but not cliché. got chef hats and mustaches. literally the cliché I didn't want.

designer 2 ($500): showed them Italian street signs and bakery photos. they made something ""vintage"" that looked like a hipster coffee shop.

designer 3 ($400): gave up explaining. said make it simple and Italian. got something generic.

I know what I want when I see it but can't speak design language. my shop is my nonna's recipes, neighborhood spot, nothing fancy. want the logo to feel warm and honest. how do you explain ""warm but not cheesy"" to a designer?

ended up trying some AI tool someone mentioned. was skeptical cause AI usually looks generic. but it asked questions like ""what's the story"" and ""what feeling do you want"". I just talked normal - nonna's kitchen, neighborhood families, eating at home.

generated 3 options. second one was exactly what I couldn't explain. simple, warm, handmade feel without trying too hard. told it ""more neighborhood-y"" and it adjusted.

then it made matching menu, signage, pizza boxes. everything consistent. took half a day.

not saying this is better than good designers. but for someone who can't communicate in design terms, it worked.

anyone else struggle with this? or am I just bad at explaining what I want?",0,1763138078.0,logodesign,36,0.33,False
