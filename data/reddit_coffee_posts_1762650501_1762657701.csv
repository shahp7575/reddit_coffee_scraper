1os8d4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crunchymom/comments/1os8d4i/need_help_cant_lose_weight_been_trying_for_over_a/,"Need help, can’t lose weight, been trying for over a year 😢😢😢","I really need help on what has been proven for effective and safe weight loss after kids and while nursing (and as fast as possible without being at all harmful).

I’m 42 with two kids about two years apart. My whole life I’ve been about 135 pounds (5’7’’) and a size 6 / medium and now I’m 200lb / an extra large /I believe size 10+. 

My facial features are like hidden from the fat, I have a thick neck, fat fingers, thick arms and bat wings, no hour glass shape to speak of—more like an apple, a belly with an overhang like I’m still pregnant (belly fat is the unhealthiest area to have fat), thighs that stick together, a lumpy butt and thighs, a hump on the back of my neck like I’m the hunchback of notre dame…I went from what men I dated (mostly fit and handsome marathon runners, boxers, and soccer players) called hot to totally obesely hideous. 

I have tried pretty hard to lose weight, but after one year having my kid, I’ve only lost 2 pounds (baseline being 10 days after delivering! A time where I was making no effort, was in bed and on the couch nonstop, eating ice cream and serotonin producing not-great foods and lots of eating out).

Since then I’ve switched to home cooked meals, kale omelette nearly every breakfast, salads nearly every lunch, balanced meals every night (for example, tonight was brown rice with meatballs and zucchini), lighter and less calorie heavy snacking, before lunches and dinners often having a powder that is high fiber, high protein, high superfoods, has a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, probiotics, and some essential fatty acids in about 10 ounces of water to help me feel full before my meals and increase my general health and energy. 

I usually drink about 60 ounces of filtered water every day. I have usually one or two lattes with stevia and once in a while I’ll treat myself to a mocha without whipped cream and some cookies and pizza 1-2 times per week and a little organic red wine a few nights a week (4.5 ounces per day max) to prevent feelings of deprivation / giving up entirely.

I’ve tried different supplements, but they make little to no difference and there’s very little I can safely take while breast-feeding so I’ve given up on them, only the powder I mentioned above. They’re also loaded with heavy metals most of them, including the postnatal multivitamin I was taking (I can’t find one that has a clean test report…have you?).

I don’t count calories because those apps have never made it easy so I feel like I’m getting widely inaccurate numbers, and regardless —I’m eating pretty much the exact same as I did when I was 135lb, maybe a little more because breast-feeding has left me more hungry, but not insane amounts. Lowering calories right now lowers milk production so it’s not a good time either.

I am doing “baby-led weaning” so I’m only now feeding roughly every four hours but at night anytime my one-year-old wakes up he wants to feed on me to go back to bed. I think more than anything, it’s the disrupted sleep that has led to the hormones going crazy and just leaving me depleted, hungry, moody, unhappy, stressed, striving for energy and mental clarity constantly, and just in a constant state of disarray.

I’m almost certain I’m suffering from stuff like high cortisol. I’ve never been good at reducing my stress and I really suck at meditation (thus, kind of hate it).

I don’t want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars out of pocket with these crazy high deductible plans just to get a couple of blood tests to check things out because anytime I’ve done that in the past, my results always came out clean/totally normal… and I did all the multiple thyroid, hypothyroid tests, all of that. And what if something is off, they’re just going to prescribe medication that I can’t safely take while nursing anyway, so frankly, I don’t see the point.

I have 65 pounds to lose and at the rate of 2 pounds per year, we’re talking 33 freaking years to get back to my normal weight when I see so many other moms (I’m not talking celebrities with trainers but every day women in my direct local circle) that got their bodies back within a couple of months. Some got them back like literally right after the baby came out. It’s baffling to me how someone dealing with all these hormones can be a twig with a round belly. Anyway, I can’t wait decades, this must go faster! Anytime it goes so slow I get so discouraged that I wanna quit and then I start slipping a little with sugar.

My body seems to want to hold onto every ounce of weight/fat during nursing or something. But I believe in “attachment parenting” and can’t ever imagine cutting off my kid and that special bonding for something as superficial as weight. But I also know at this weight it’s much more serious than just appearance.

My extra weight has led to back pain, pelvic pain, foot and knee pain, shoulder pain, not wanting to be seen in public or by my own husband, etc. 
I try to walk, but my injuries and aches only allow me to do so much. I’ve had a hip injury that’s been extremely stubborn and hasn’t gone away for almost 10 years now. Pretty much the only solution seems to be surgery, which I refuse to do at such a young age, it just causes so many problems, so long story short, I can’t do high impact stuff. I get really bored with gyms and stuff so for me, I need something like sports and it’s hard to find one that is not high impact. Especially when you’re competitive. Swimming is one but that’s one that makes you hungrier due to the temperature drop (that’s why walruses, whales, and other sea animals are thicker than animals like cheetahs and horses).

I fight sugar and caffeine cravings a lot, sometimes even nicotine. In the past, I relied on caffeine a lot for an energy and mood lift and sort of an appetite suppressant. Same with v@ping and supplements to help with sugar cravings and appetite control and metabolism boosts. I also detoxed a lot to help get rid of sugar cravings (stuff like coffee enemas and infrared sauna sessions) and I did a combination of water-only fasting and intermittent fasting, and I restricted carbs but I can’t do any of that while nursing. And I wonder, was it restricting carbs that has slowed down my metabolism? Is it bad to do that long-term?

And then there is the emotional element of eating which I am leaning more on because I’m often frustrated a lot from the lack of freedom and how hard it is to take care of two young kids, and ever since pregnancy started, but especially after, it has really taken a toll on my relationship with my husband. I’m just often very angry and on edge and moody, and feel lack of emotional support which makes me feel a void and resentful toward my husband. Having kids has also increased my anxiety, which has made me more controlling, striving for a sense of order, especially so my kids get enough rest, are developed well, etc.

And I also like a lot of flavor in my foods, I was raised in a culture that uses a lot of olive oil and a lot of salt and a lot of seasoning and to have bland food feels like a sort of joyless prison.

And every psychologist/ therapist I have ever seen has just utterly failed me, I find it such a waste of time, never any results. I don’t need anyone to talk to, I just need someone who can change negative thoughts and habits and after seeing maybe a dozen therapists over the years, it’s just impossible to find someone who can actually make a noticeable difference. I even tried hypnotherapy and trauma therapy (was abused as a kid) but nope, I’m in the same boat. I feel like all they do is drain your bank account and your time.

Anyway, if any of you have faced a similar situation or have suggestions on what may work in my circumstances, is proven safe during nursing, etc. please share.

Im looking for a scent to gift my boyfriend for our anniversary,  buts since Im only a student I can only afford thise sold in online shops and sa Tiktok ako nagtitingin now although wala talaga akong idea kung gaano sila kabango huhu... So for those men po who've tried famous tiktok scents or to gfs/bfs who have gifted their partner one of these, can you please advice me on which is best???

Right now Im leaning towards Supremo from New York Army kasi it has vannila and cinnamon notes, which I like and I gusto ko rin yung sa description niyang powdery ang amoy pag tumagal... However Im also considering other bestsellers which is yung Cloudy Shadow from Andrea Secret and Brookly from NewYork Army...

Basta, for him I want a scent na anlakas maka-soft/good boy ang atake, but at the same time manly yung amoy na mejo edible ganern huhu I hope it makes sense...

You guys can also recommend and drop links to other scents that you've tried po, but my budget for this is up to ₱500 pesos lang po sana muna...

Hoping someone could help mee and thank you so much pooo! 🫶",0,1762657286.0,CasualPH,0,0.5,False

So for 7 days this is what I did and it worked for me and I could potentially do this same routine every day for the next 3 months to lower my hba1c to non diabetic range

Morning: bolus 4 units for black coffee and oat milk at 6am

  
7 am bolus 8 units for peanut butter sandwich

  
Bg would be flatlined to the 140s 130s

  
11am lunch would be beef pot roast, mashed potatoes, carrots and green beans and bolus would be 3 units

  
And dinner would be Madras lentils that has lentils, red beans, spices and tomato sauce...bolus for 4 units

  
Bg would be flatlined in the 140s and 130s for 7 days I would bolus 2 units before bed if my bg is 140 to 150 and it would be flatlined in good range over night...didn't experience lows for these 7 days...my low alarm is set at 90

  
Now last night was strange.....my bg was flatlined in the 110s , and 100s the whole night that i was sleeping which was strange and scary, woke up

  
Bolused for black coffee and oat milk in the morning at 6am, then 7am I bolus 4 units for peanut butter sandwich not 8...4 and to my surprise my bg didn't skyrocket because I lowered my dose for​...and I didnt go low either...straight lined I was just wow...just imagined if I did 8 units instead of 4 I would've been in severe hypoglycemia 

  
Im on dexcom g7 and mdi (semglee and humalog)...been living with it for 1 year now and I got diagnosed at age 27

  
My question is...why did my insulin needs decreased????

But I believe in “attachment parenting” and can’t ever imagine cutting off my kid and that special bonding for something as superficial as weight. But I also know at this weight it’s much more serious than just appearance.

My extra weight has led to back pain, pelvic pain, foot and knee pain, shoulder pain, not wanting to be seen in public or by my own husband, etc. 
I try to walk, but my injuries and aches only allow me to do so much. I’ve had a hip injury that’s been extremely stubborn and hasn’t gone away for almost 10 years now. Pretty much the only solution seems to be surgery, which I refuse to do at such a young age, it just causes so many problems, so long story short, I can’t do high impact stuff. I get really bored with gyms and stuff so for me, I need something like sports and it’s hard to find one that is not high impact. Especially when you’re competitive. Swimming is one but that’s one that makes you hungrier due to the temperature drop (that’s why walruses, whales, and other sea animals are thicker than animals like cheetahs and horses).

I fight sugar and caffeine cravings a lot, sometimes even nicotine. In the past, I relied on caffeine a lot for an energy and mood lift and sort of an appetite suppressant. Same with v@ping and supplements to help with sugar cravings and appetite control and metabolism boosts. I also detoxed a lot to help get rid of sugar cravings (stuff like coffee enemas and infrared sauna sessions) and I did a combination of water-only fasting and intermittent fasting, and I restricted carbs but I can’t do any of that while nursing. And I wonder, was it restricting carbs that has slowed down my metabolism? Is it bad to do that long-term?

And then there is the emotional element of eating which I am leaning more on because I’m often frustrated a lot from the lack of freedom and how hard it is to take care of two young kids, and ever since pregnancy started, but especially after, it has really taken a toll on my relationship with my husband. I’m just often very angry and on edge and moody, and feel lack of emotional support which makes me feel a void and resentful toward my husband. Having kids has also increased my anxiety, which has made me more controlling, striving for a sense of order, especially so my kids get enough rest, are developed well, etc.

And I also like a lot of flavor in my foods, I was raised in a culture that uses a lot of olive oil and a lot of salt and a lot of seasoning and to have bland food feels like a sort of joyless prison.

And every psychologist/ therapist I have ever seen has just utterly failed me, I find it such a waste of time, never any results. I don’t need anyone to talk to, I just need someone who can change negative thoughts and habits and after seeing maybe a dozen therapists over the years, it’s just impossible to find someone who can actually make a noticeable difference. I even tried hypnotherapy and trauma therapy (was abused as a kid) but nope, I’m in the same boat. I feel like all they do is drain your bank account and your time.

Anyway, if any of you have faced a similar situation or have suggestions on what may work in my circumstances, is proven safe during nursing, etc. please share.

For the record - my partner can be incredibly oblivious,  and he does not like it when I say it. This isn't something he is trying to do, but I dont know how to handle this hypothetical question (that I brought up)

We had been friends for over 4 years. I had been developing feelings for him for awhile. We started hanging out more one on one (im a year and a half older than him and always dated older - he was NOT on my radar until I was about 28/29). I remember going to a scary movie and used that excuse to hold his hand the entire night (I am not generally a touchy person).

When we left that night, we hugged at least 10 times with me staring into his eyes hoping for a kiss before finally leaving. The next time we hung out, first time we were one on one I finally confessed I ""had the feels"" for him. He got all smiley and said he felt the same way. We wentt around the corner and kissed. Due to him being part of the ""friend circle,"" i wanted to be sure before we told them anything - he didnt give a fuck. With his friends, outside our group, he always introduced me as the gril he was going to marry.

Part of this is that he may be a little ""neuro-divergent."" I am his first long term relationship - and we've made it to 7 years. He gets hung up on little details sometimes.

It took us awhile to get on the same page of women coming on to him - he legit didnt think it was happening/didnt notice. There was one woman who literally reached across me to rub his thigh a bunch and commented, several times, that she was in a polyamorous relationship. We talked about it later, and he was just like - new friend! Wait, what? Don't remember them touching me...

Both of us our very monogamous. No question of that. I thought we were on the same page of not hanging out with people of the opposite sex one on one, at their place. And he hasn't- we kind of are on the same page there.

But what are your thoughts on people in a long term relationship hanging our with people of the opposite sex (or whichever you are attacked to).

My parents have been married for over 50 years. My friends who are married/long term relationships would agree with this - hanging out like that could lead to problems. I just think its a good idea to avoid those situations. Grab some coffee! Get lunch! And he doesnt just go over and hang out with women at their place... but the man doesnt like to be told what to do and I am having a difficult time explaining WHY this could be an issue ""when its just platonic"" (again, this is really hypothetical)

Any insight? Apologies if I dodnt explain things well - emphasis on us being monogamous. He rarely even hangs out other people. Don't want reddit to come and do the whole ""he's cheating"" thing. We are together 98% of the time outside of work and school. Both homebodies.",1,1762656896.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False
1os85z3,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterloo/comments/1os85z3/will_we_ever_see_the_return_of_latenight_cafes_in/,Will we ever see the return of late-night cafes in the uptown/university area?,"Cafes are hands-down my favourite kind of place to study/work for a few reasons:

* good coffee and snacks
* atmosphere/ambient stimulation, stuff like lighting, smells, and the perfect amount of background noise
* more relaxed vibes than campus or the libraries
* constantly running into people I know or meeting new folks, or even just bantering with the staff. It really lets me feel closer to the community

I had some group plans fall through tonight so I decided to just get some studying done. Today is a Saturday, so luckily Cafe 1842 at Huether is open until 10. However my options are much more limited on weekdays, with basically all the options near campus/uptown (except for Williams and Sweet Dreams) closing around 8pm.

After searching through this subreddit looking for new places open late, I came across a few people that mentioned a lot of them actually used to be open later pre-pandemic. For example Princess until 10:30 and Williams until 1am. I've heard from others that Midnight Run used to be open later as well (giving slightly more credence to its name lol).

It's no secret that the pandemic really hammered a lot of these businesses, especially the ones with long operating hours. It's really unfortunate though, because judging by my conversations with friends and other folks it seems like there's a massive appetite in this city for cafes that stay open late, especially around exam season.

So my question for those who work in or tangent to the industry, and just the folks here in general: how likely is it that these businesses will go back to pre-pandemic operating hours, or even beyond at some point? Vancouver has [Breka](https://www.breka.ca/), a chain of lovely 24-hour cafes and I'm sure Toronto has a few as well. Perhaps the demand for such a thing is lower here, but I would love to see more spots stay open until midnight or later. What about you guys?",7,1762656823.0,waterloo,0,1.0,False

I have been through surgeries before, but this one has been on another level. The pain is not just in my shoulder, it runs from the top of my shoulder through my forearm and down into my hand, sometimes all the way into my palm. It is a deep, aching, nerve-type pain that makes me shiver when it spikes.

I have been following all the rules: PT, icing, sleeping propped up, gentle pendulums, and being careful with movement. Thankfully I have had a steady supply of pain pills, and they are the only thing that takes the edge off, but they do not get rid of the pain. I also take gabapentin three times a day, which helps a bit with the nerve pain, but mornings are still rough.

Some days give me hope, like last Thursday when I woke up feeling great and even went out for coffee with no meds. Then the next day it all came roaring back after a tough PT session. It is just exhausting. I was hoping I would be past this by now, but it feels like I am stuck in the middle of the storm.

Over the past year, he’s started taking his ring off a lot when we spend time together, including not wearing it at all on a business trip the two of us went on together. On this trip in particular he make comments about how we kept getting one check so we must look like a couple, paid for my ticket to activities we did, sat real close when there was plenty of space. He invites me to get coffee, breakfast, etc. every week or so. One particular instance we got food, he insisted on paying, and then wanted us to park behind an old building and just chill in the car and eat instead of going back to the office. 

He also invites me to go with him to run little errands during the workday, and apparently got told that if he kept doing this he was going to get written up. I’ve met his kids several times, but have never met his wife. I feel like he finds little innocent ways for us to touch, like his knee leaning on mine and not pulling away if we’re sitting next to each other, or playing footsie under the conference room table.

1os80nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightlossafterbaby/comments/1os80nb/please_help_cant_lose_any_weight/,Please help! Can’t lose any weight 😢😢😢,"I really need help on what has been proven for effective and safe weight loss after kids and while nursing (and as fast as possible without being at all harmful).

I’m 42 with two kids about two years apart. My whole life I’ve been about 135 pounds (5’7’’) and a size 6 / medium and now I’m 200lb / an extra large /I believe size 10+. 

My facial features are like hidden from the fat, I have a thick neck, fat fingers, thick arms and bat wings, no hour glass shape to speak of—more like an apple, a belly with an overhang like I’m still pregnant (belly fat is the unhealthiest area to have fat), thighs that stick together, a lumpy butt and thighs, a hump on the back of my neck like I’m the hunchback of notre dame…I went from what men I dated (mostly fit and handsome marathon runners, boxers, and soccer players) called hot to totally obesely hideous. 

I have tried pretty hard to lose weight, but after one year having my kid, I’ve only lost 2 pounds (baseline being 10 days after delivering! A time where I was making no effort, was in bed and on the couch nonstop, eating ice cream and serotonin producing not-great foods and lots of eating out).

Since then I’ve switched to home cooked meals, kale omelette nearly every breakfast, salads nearly every lunch, balanced meals every night (for example, tonight was brown rice with meatballs and zucchini), lighter and less calorie heavy snacking, before lunches and dinners often having a powder that is high fiber, high protein, high superfoods, has a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, probiotics, and some essential fatty acids in about 10 ounces of water to help me feel full before my meals and increase my general health and energy. 

I usually drink about 60 ounces of filtered water every day. I have usually one or two lattes with stevia and once in a while I’ll treat myself to a mocha without whipped cream and some cookies and pizza 1-2 times per week and a little organic red wine a few nights a week (4.5 ounces per day max) to prevent feelings of deprivation / giving up entirely.

I’ve tried different supplements, but they make little to no difference and there’s very little I can safely take while breast-feeding so I’ve given up on them, only the powder I mentioned above. They’re also loaded with heavy metals most of them, including the postnatal multivitamin I was taking (I can’t find one that has a clean test report…have you?).

I don’t count calories because those apps have never made it easy so I feel like I’m getting widely inaccurate numbers, and regardless —I’m eating pretty much the exact same as I did when I was 135lb, maybe a little more because breast-feeding has left me more hungry, but not insane amounts. Lowering calories right now lowers milk production so it’s not a good time either.

I am doing “baby-led weaning” so I’m only now feeding roughly every four hours but at night anytime my one-year-old wakes up he wants to feed on me to go back to bed. I think more than anything, it’s the disrupted sleep that has led to the hormones going crazy and just leaving me depleted, hungry, moody, unhappy, stressed, striving for energy and mental clarity constantly, and just in a constant state of disarray.

I’m almost certain I’m suffering from stuff like high cortisol. I’ve never been good at reducing my stress and I really suck at meditation (thus, kind of hate it).

I don’t want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars out of pocket with these crazy high deductible plans just to get a couple of blood tests to check things out because anytime I’ve done that in the past, my results always came out clean/totally normal… and I did all the multiple thyroid, hypothyroid tests, all of that. And what if something is off, they’re just going to prescribe medication that I can’t safely take while nursing anyway, so frankly, I don’t see the point.

I have 65 pounds to lose and at the rate of 2 pounds per year, we’re talking 33 freaking years to get back to my normal weight when I see so many other moms (I’m not talking celebrities with trainers but every day women in my direct local circle) that got their bodies back within a couple of months. Some got them back like literally right after the baby came out. It’s baffling to me how someone dealing with all these hormones can be a twig with a round belly. Anyway, I can’t wait decades, this must go faster! Anytime it goes so slow I get so discouraged that I wanna quit and then I start slipping a little with sugar.

He said he worked out and honestly looked overweight. Nothing like in his pictures. In all of his pictures he was wearing a baseball hat, so I got a little concerned that he might be balding and unfortunately I was right. He was wearing a hat on the date too, I'm assuming to hide his baldness, but he wanted to show me his haircut and took his hat off and the baldness was revealed. His teeth were also very bad. The best way I can describe them is as corn teeth. I honestly wanted to turn around right then and there, but I didn't want to be rude so I went on the date.

We had a whole afternoon and dinner planned out (also a mistake on my part). Should've just planned a coffee date or something like that. When we got there he told me how pretty I was and he honestly seemed shocked that he was able to match with someone like me. Not to be arrogant or anything, but I am definitely out of his league.

It sounds crazy, I know, because the distance part sucks. But hear me out on why I think LDR is the ultimate relationship ""pre-game.""

Why distance makes sense? Well, you date the brain first. Let's be real, when you're local, it's easy to get distracted by physical chemistry and cute dinner dates. LDR strips all that away. You have to talk. You're forced to spend hours diving into each other's heads—their dreams, their dumbest fears, how they handle conflict, and what they truly value. You get to know the soul and the personality before the body ever enters the picture. That kind of deep-dive foundation is gold.

Second, no half-assing it. When you're dealing with time zones, expensive flights, and weird scheduling, everything has to be intentional. There are no spontaneous ""Hey, wanna grab coffee?"" moments. Every call is planned, every visit is a major production. This teaches you both early on that you are worth the effort and commitment. If they're willing to go through LDR hell for you, you know they're serious.

Third, the best dates are the visit. Honestly, the anticipation for those visits is electric. Because you already know each other so well mentally, the in-person part isn't about awkward first dates; it's a massive, beautiful reunion with your best friend. It makes those first few weeks of being together feel so much more meaningful and less like a trial run.

Lastly, independence is baked in. Being long-distance means you have to maintain your own life, friends, and hobbies. When you finally close the gap, you're not instantly suffocating each other. You're blending two strong, independent lives, not two halves trying to become one whole. That's way healthier for the long run.

So yeah, LDR is a challenge, but maybe it's the best challenge to ensure a relationship is strong, honest, and built on actual connection rather than convenience. It's like a rigorous stress test that weeds out the casual flings.

Create a fast-paced, visually engaging, and creative video where the entire story is told using only 10-second clips. The goal is to challenge traditional video editing norms, entertain viewers, and inspire discussion about storytelling, creativity, and brevity.

Concept

The video is structured entirely from 10-second segments (from your footage, stock clips, or a mix).

Each clip must advance the story or joke, forcing creative transitions and pacing.

Humor, suspense, or relatability emerges from how the clips interact and flow despite the strict time limit.

Optional: add text overlays or minimal narration to enhance clarity without breaking the “10-second rule.”

Structure

Intro (0:00–0:10)

Quick hook: a dramatic, funny, or confusing clip.

Overlay text: “I made a whole video using only 10-second clips… here’s what happened.”

Narration (optional):

“Each clip you see is exactly 10 seconds long. No exceptions. Can a story still make sense?”

Setup (0:10–0:50)

Introduce the “theme” or premise of the video using several 10-second clips.

Examples: morning routine, a mini adventure, or a comedic mishap.

Keep edits tight and visually dynamic to keep attention.

Challenge Segment (0:50–2:00)

Introduce humor or tension: clips force unexpected transitions.

Example: spilling coffee → sudden 10-second clip of running late → abrupt transition to transportation.

Include exaggerated reactions or text overlay for comedic effect.

Climactic Moment (2:00–3:00)

Combine multiple 10-second clips to create a mini narrative peak.

Could be funny chaos, a surprising twist, or a relatable moment.

Overlay sound effects or minimal music to highlight pacing.

Wrap-Up (3:00–3:30)

End with a satisfying or humorous resolution within a 10-second clip.

Optional text overlay: “Can you believe this was all 10-second clips?”

Encourage viewer engagement:

“Think you could make a video like this? Comment your ideas!”

Technical Execution

Camera: Any camera or phone; focus on framing each 10-second segment cleanly.

Editing: Precision timing is key—clips must be exactly 10 seconds, transitions sharp but smooth.

Style: Fast, visually engaging, playful with creative transitions.",1,1762656100.0,ViralContentIdeaFarm,0,1.0,False

With a starting weight of 89.6 I started on 2.5 and lost not anything in the first 2 weeks . In the following 2 weeks I lost 5kg.
I then went up to the 5 mg & almost had a stroke when I had to pay 💰 
I’ve just taken my 3rd dose today .
I’m currently sitting at 82.9 which I’m happy about .
The thing is , I’m not sure if it’s the mounjaro losing the weight or my lack of food.
I have lost all desire to eat anything ! 
When I do eat, it will be something as small as half a sandwich 🥪 then I’m full .
I’ll have a banana for breaky to get my metabolism started .
There is no way I feel like dinner , I may have a bickie and a cup of coffee & feel totally sated .
The money I have spent really evens out my lack of buying food.
I have bought a multivitamin & feel ok.
Whereas before I could have eaten the wooden leg off of a chair .
I’m going back to the 2.5 and will happily coast along whilst all food cravings have disappeared. For that, I am grateful 😀
I’ll just have to be very mindful as my niece has changed from Mounjaro to wegovey and has put back on 3kg and is hungry all the time again.

A lot of you claim to be medical professionals, investigative journalists, familiar with edge cases, have an eye for details, etc. etc. etc.

This is related to my diet, why it is the way it is. 

**I'm not forcing anyone to read or respond. You can just downvote and scroll on. Slightly TMI.**

---

For as long as I can remember, I've had severe discomfort (pain?) after consuming certain foods. I've never been able to figure out why. Doctors have never been able to figure out why. LLMs haven't been able to pinpoint why either. 

I can present the following:

- I was born with this ""disorder"". My mother says I appeared to be in visible pain as an infant each time before urinating. 
- both of my parents are vegetarian. I grew up entirely vegetarian. No meat, no fish. Definitely not vegan though. 
- I've had ultrasounds of my bladder and various other testing done as a toddler. I've seen docs and specialists throughout my teens. 
- occasionally during these flare ups, my bloodwork lightly comes back positive for a UTI. 
- after taking medication, antibiotics, self care, etc. The flare ups come back almost immediately afterwards. 
- I grew up basically assuming this was normal. I didn't understand why I would feel so uncomfortable after eating a meal with my family. About 30 mins afterwards I'd go lay down in a fetal position clutching my abdomen in pain instead of going outside to play with my friends. 
- basically every single meal I ate was vegetarian and contained one of the triggering foods (below). 
- every urologist in every state/country I've seen has said they've never even heard of my situation and brushed it off as just ""no clue, go see a psychiatrist"" and later when learning about triggers, ""just avoid those foods then bud""

For the first 17 years of my life, nobody even had any idea this was even diet related. We figured it was just some kind of recurring resistant superbug or something. 

Until one day, when I was 17... There was a fuckton of red cabbage on sale. I bought literally like 11 heads of it. Maybe more, anyway. 

I love red cabbage and each morning I'd wake up and boil a head and eat the whole thing for breakfast. I was in the worst pain of my life for the entire week and again, no idea why. 

Until I ran out of cabbage. That urinary pain and sensitivity was gone immediately. 

So I bought some more and tried again. Yep. Pain is back. That was my first indication that the ""UTIs"" I've been experiencing every week of my life was diet related. So I worked through my foods and... 

Identified the trigger list:
- spinach
- broccoli 
- brussel sprouts
- kale
- other salad greens
- asparagus 
- CABBAGE (white, red, whatever) 

Because I don't eat meat and I develop Pancreatitis if I eat fruits (long story, you can thank medical malpractice when I was 15), my only option was dairy. A diet I've been on almost exclusively since age 17. 

I will occasionally cave and eat some cabbage or salad as a treat and hate myself so much for the next 6-8hrs until the discomfort passes. 

Before you say ""oh that's easy Z, You got Interstitial cystitis""... No. Because I can eat:

- all dairy (obviously) 
- literally raw jalapeño peppers 
- raw cloves of garlic/onion
- anything super hot or spicy really 
- coffee
- artificial sweeteners in droves
- protein powder 
- soy, tofu
- tomatoes, sauces 

Etc. Anything traditionally considered a trigger for IC is delicious and not a problem for me at all. 

---

Since starting painkillers (hydromophone) I've noticed it's dulled the effects of this discomfort when eating those foods. Not eliminated, but not severe. 

I just want to be able to eat salads man. You know how hard it is to be vegetarian and to not be able to eat vegetables? 

Yes. I've asked doctors, asked in medical subreddits, asked my aunt, the librarian, the boba tea girl at my favorite cafe. Legit nobody had any idea whatsoever. I cross refd people with EDS, Lupus, PV, and other related conditions to set if they had any overlap with my problem here. None. 

I occasionally joke that a disease will be named after me, but I'm 30yrs in... with no answers and I'm not so sure that's a joke anymore.

The plan looked amazing: clean hotels, misty mornings, bonfire dances, logical flow… until I realized something.

He made us drive to Kaili, then magically take the bullet train back to Wuhan.

Excuse me, sir? Where exactly did the car go? Did it ascend? Was it repossessed by the mountain gods?

I literally texted him:

“We’re driving there and driving back. If we take the train, what happens to the car???”

And he went, all calm and philosophical, like:

“Ah, you’re right — that makes sense.”

Which made me laugh so hard I almost spilled my coffee.
Apparently, in his mind, cars are temporary plot devices. You use them for Act One, then they despawn.

To be fair, the rest of the plan was solid — he even picked hotels that fit my “no stilt houses, clean wooden interiors only” policy — but now I can’t stop imagining my SUV quietly dissolving in the parking lot while I ride the high-speed train back home.

0/10 for logistics.

TITLE: Newspaper
### Part 1
He smiled and kicked back in his chair, the two back legs teetering like skates as the sun cascaded through the dated glass above his kitchen sink. He knew it was old, but he liked it that way. He loved the way the sunlight splintered through, sending beams of light rippling through his ritualistic morning cup of orange juice. There was a newspaper on the table, but he hated them. He had nothing to do today, so he sat, enjoying the smell of over easy eggs with peppers and cheese drifting through the apartment.

It reminded him of that time Sarah and him spent the weekend at Lake Erie, breakfasts with sunrise and afternoons spent walking Atlas on the beach trying to get him to go in the water, laughing hysterically as his legs scrambled through the waves, his neck stretched out, eyes shot wide open, fur sticking out in porcupine-like spikes. They felt bad but it was a sight to see. They finished laughing and sat down on a taupe piece of driftwood, which they later used as a centerpiece for the monolithic aquarium they had in the corner of his apartment’s bedroom.

When she spent the night, Sarah loved to wake up watching the red guppies flutter about like pairs waltzing in the Grand Concourse. Every morning, when he managed to pull himself out of bed, he’d look over and see her sprinkling flakes of wonder to the fish below as they darted to the surface to feast as if their next meal wasn’t promised to them. She’d sing Amazing Grace while she did it, and after she was done, she’d turn to smile at him, a dimple beautifully nesting into her right cheek as it always did. It was during these moments that he knew he’d marry her. 

A two carat marquise was going for a touch over a grand, and he didn’t have much money but he saw the way her face lit up as they walked by jewelry store at 18th and Forbes. The Russian running the register with a face shield covered in an amalgam of silver shavings and rouge didn’t say much, scoffing as he tossed the ring on the counter next to that day’s issue. Something about a hostage situation in Jordan. Paying little mind but a fair bit of cash, he left the jewelry store sweating.

Sarah jumped into his arms as soon as he pulled the ring out, her tears forming a puddle in his collarbone. He had been all worked up for nothing, she was thrilled beyond all measure. They got married that May, the forsythia covering the knoll next to the stables on her father’s barn. He spent all his money on her ring, so they had to move in with Sarah’s parents. The wedding picture of them on her childhood tire swing sat next to pepper on his stove. The glass was cracked and it had a white fragment in the center, but he didn’t pay that any mind. He flipped the eggs and smiled at the picture.
### Part 2
He lit a Marlboro 100 and put a hand through his five-o’-clock shadow. He burnt his eggs. Too worried about the newspaper that sat on the checkered table. How did people give a damn about the European Union? He hated newspapers. He ashed his cigarette on the eggs before he washed the pan out. It was one of those woks that she insisted to wash lightly so it didn’t lose its cure. His teeth clung onto the butt like a hangover clings to your Sunday morning. He looked at the picture.

Next to that tire swing is where it happened. Sarah told him she wanted to stop taking her medication. He insisted that she keep going for just a little while longer. Sarah was screaming now, saying that he thought she was crazy. I don’t think you’re crazy. You’ve made so much progress and I don’t want to see you struggle again. Whatever.

Sarah woke up screaming and shaking. He flung himself on top of her, trying to be her safety blanket so she didn’t grab anything sharp. He looked at the amber bottle of pills sitting on her nightstand. It was almost full. He didn’t know how to do it, but she needed to get back on those pills. By noon she had calmed. She sat in the conservatory, staring out the window at a pair of cardinals, flitting about by the deck railings.

In the coming months, he had gotten Sarah back on her medication. She seemed happy, but she was always tired. Her mother had died, and it was taking a toll on her. He knew he had to get her out of that house, so he mentioned the idea of getting an apartment downtown together. Sarah agreed. She needed to get out of that house.

The apartment was the same one he was sitting in now. It was nothing to write home about, but it was enough room for them. They were hoping to start a family soon and things were going well. Sarah had found a teaching job in the South Hills, and he was pouring concrete for a company in Mount Lebanon. They were putting enough in savings to start trying. Three weeks after their two year anniversary, at the Grandview, Sarah told him she was pregnant. They sat there and laughed. They laughed for hours. He couldn’t wait. Couldn’t believe this was happening.

He finished washing the wok and looked over from the stove into the bedroom. The crib had speckled sunlight shining on it from the window above the sink. He sat down at the table and lit another cigarette. After some minutes, some ash fluttered down onto the newspaper. He hated newspapers.

### Part 3
It was twenty-two hundred the next day. Couldn’t sleep. He took another pull of Jack. He was looking at the picture, which he set on the coffee table. It still had the same crack in the glass. The same white fragment in the center. He took another pull of Jack. There was a newspaper next to the picture frame. Something about a unit in Syria. They weren’t getting it that bad. He could still see that hijab. He fucking hated newspapers. He took another pull of Jack. He put it down next to the stack of coasters they got in Erie.

He was thinking about when Sarah was flipping the top coaster through her fingers. She was nine months pregnant but real sick. I’m real sick babe. He snapped to and took a pull of Jack, then faded back. Sarah said I’m real sick. He knew her pill bottle was full. It’s not your fault love, I promise. Sarah said I can’t keep doing this. He looked at her with a confused brow. He said how can you leave me? We’re about to have a kid. I love you. Where would you even go?

The sunlight caught a flash of silver. He couldn’t catch the hammer in time. He didn’t catch it in time. He caught her before she fell off the chair. Behind him, a piece of her temple was stuck in the picture frame. Shattered the glass. Red. He snapped to, Jack, faded back. Her left eye was on the newspaper on the coffee table. He fucking hated newspapers. Why is your pill bottle full? Sarah’s eye on the newspaper was watching him. He fucking hated newspapers. Why didn’t you catch the hammer? Those guys in Syria weren’t getting it that bad. 

He came to, and took a pull of Jack. He put one through his left femur, but this time he didn’t want to catch the hammer. That’s for not catching it in time. It’s your fault. He took the newspaper out of the box, still had the stain on it. He fucking hated newspapers. Jack. If you were faster you would’ve caught the hammer. You should’ve kept the thirty eight locked. You insisted on having it. Should’ve kept it locked. Your fault. 

He knew she was sick, he could have put the meds in her food or something. He should’ve it was his fault. One through the right femur. This time he didn’t want to catch the hammer. That’s for not putting the meds in her food. He looked over at the crib. No sunlight. He took the fragment out of the picture frame and looked at it. The glass fell loose. Red. You should’ve put the meds in her food. Your fault. This time he didn’t wan’t to catch the hammer.",1,1762655810.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

### **2. A Gooseneck Electric Kettle**
For anyone into pour-over coffee (like a V60 or Chemex), a gooseneck kettle is non-negotiable. It offers the precision and control needed to evenly saturate the grounds. An electric model that keeps the water at a precise temperature is a game-changer. Check out the **Fellow Stagg EKG**—it's a work of art and a powerhouse tool.

1os7qot,https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/comments/1os7qot/i_prefer_ldr_first_irl_later/,"I prefer ldr first, irl later.","I wanna start a relationship long-distance before ever getting to the in-person stage. Like, seriously.

It sounds crazy, I know, because the distance part sucks. But hear me out on why I think LDR is the ultimate relationship ""pre-game.""

Why distance makes sense? Well, you date the brain first. Let's be real, when you're local, it's easy to get distracted by physical chemistry and cute dinner dates. LDR strips all that away. You have to talk. You're forced to spend hours diving into each other's heads—their dreams, their dumbest fears, how they handle conflict, and what they truly value. You get to know the soul and the personality before the body ever enters the picture. That kind of deep-dive foundation is gold.

Second, no half-assing it. When you're dealing with time zones, expensive flights, and weird scheduling, everything has to be intentional. There are no spontaneous ""Hey, wanna grab coffee?"" moments. Every call is planned, every visit is a major production. This teaches you both early on that you are worth the effort and commitment. If they're willing to go through LDR hell for you, you know they're serious.

Third, the best dates are the visit. Honestly, the anticipation for those visits is electric. Because you already know each other so well mentally, the in-person part isn't about awkward first dates; it's a massive, beautiful reunion with your best friend. It makes those first few weeks of being together feel so much more meaningful and less like a trial run.

Lastly, independence is baked in. Being long-distance means you have to maintain your own life, friends, and hobbies. When you finally close the gap, you're not instantly suffocating each other. You're blending two strong, independent lives, not two halves trying to become one whole. That's way healthier for the long run.

So yeah, LDR is a challenge, but maybe it's the best challenge to ensure a relationship is strong, honest, and built on actual connection rather than convenience. It's like a rigorous stress test that weeds out the casual flings.

Am I alone in this LDR-first preference? Wanna hear your thoughts!

Why did you do this? 

I had a fuckton of fun last year searching around for my ideal latte - heavily spiced and aromatic with pepper. I want caffeinated soup.

Learn anything?

I want to get ballsy enough to ask Ugly Duck and Happy Gut to mix their pumpkin syrup and habanero syrups in a latte for me. I know what to look for next year after two years of raw data, so I can write out all the places I missed and prioritize them for next year.

Are you okay?

Pfft, hell no, but I like exploring, I just need a goal to give me that extra push. This is the only flavored drink I seek out annually. I'm usually happy with a dirty chai or black coffee at home. My wallet will be a lot happier in a bit.",25,1762655498.0,Rochester,2,0.96,False
1os7pbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Perspective2Lessons/comments/1os7pbx/battle_scars_and_bliss/,Battle Scars and Bliss,"My self-love is pure and sweet, and as funny as it can be, for it runs deep. I do not care if people call it selfish; that kind of judgment often says more about them than it does about me.

Society might tell me it's not okay to be picky, but I know that selectivity demands consistency. Love and care are what make a relationship last, and if I don't have that for myself, how can I give it to someone else?

I gave years of my life—from my late twenties into my early thirties—to a first-everything relationship that became my greatest lesson. When it ended, I almost broke, but my foundation held. I returned, stronger, to the woman I had built before it began. It was a homecoming I will never regret.

Sure, it sucks when my mind plays tricks, whispering that contentment will cost me connection. When that happens, I reflect it back: my mystery person will be someone who knows their own shadows and their own light. They will have done their work so that they can meet me in the middle—in the sacred overlap of our Venn diagrams.

Until then, I'm just going to be. 
I will still be me.
And if they don't like it? 
They can go find less😘🍂 

Oh, the wonderful dates I have by myself. I adventure on my own two feet, dining alone in a crowded place, simply enjoying the music and the distant laughter of groups in their own space. In these moments, I feel a deep contentment, savoring this unfiltered, unbiased time with myself over a sandwich and sweet potato fries.

I smile at the waitress as she comes near. She asks if I would like tiramisu tonight, reading the flash in my eyes and my nod. She returns with a plate for one. The dessert is a perfect little tower, dusted in cocoa. I take the first bite—the cool, creamy mascarpone giving way to the soft, coffee-soaked ladyfingers. As it melts on my tongue, I observe the movements, breathe in the smells, and feel the emotions all around me, as contentment and pure bliss come raining down.

I leave the café for a long walk. The cool autumn air is sharp and clean in my lungs, carrying the scent of damp earth and crumbling leaves. Sunlight, golden and low, filters through the branches, setting the canopy of red and gold ablaze. With every step, the crisp leaves crunch satisfyingly under my artsy shoes, a rhythm for my wandering thoughts.

It is not all rainbows and sunshine. It is the active, daily practice of my love—the decision to nurture myself, to dust myself off, and to rise with conviction from every stumble and fall. These are not just messes; they are the battle scars that prove I am always fighting for myself, and I am always winning my way back.

Like the other day, I fell and scraped my knees. A tear dropped onto my cheek, but a soft thought of persevering compelled me to stand tall, my chin raised higher than Mount Everest's peak. I walked away with a merciful compass, guiding my own care.

I love myself enough to know what I need to wear to anchor and advocate for my spirit. People ask what my secret is, and I tell them the truth:

Knowing my own light and my own shadow is how I learn to fully love and accept this self. I am the only one who lives this life from within. So I will learn to understand myself, wholeheartedly, again and again.

And this self-love, in all its forms, will always remain.

1os7o8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/pppdizziness/comments/1os7o8c/pppd/,PPPD?,"I know no one here can diagnose but hoping to find anyone whose had a similar experience here to mine because I’m not sure if the PPPD path is what I should explore with the doctors and I’m desperate and also need to vent because I feel like this is going to implode my life. 

I’m barely able to work. I’m grateful I work remote but it’s gotten to the point where half the day I’m crying in front of the monitor scared to death that I have some terrible disease lurking that doctors aren’t finding.  I’ve cancelled all my social plans. I feel really hopeless. 

On 9/29 in I flew home from Denver. On 10/1 while working (computer/desk work) I felt this sensation come over my head, like doing a strong whip it, sucking in helium or having a tuning fork in it. I thought I was having a stroke. It was only a few seconds but I got tunnel vision. 

Immediately after I experienced disequilibrium, which I’ve had for 38 days since. There was no vertigo/spinning. It just like gravity pull, feeling like I was on a raft type thing, off gait and extremely light headed more often than not. 

I feel mildly better when I’m walking oddly but laying/sitting is rough. I’ve identified “triggers” that make it much worse- work unfortunately is one, the screen itself and I assume the stress. Midway and immediately after eating it’s bad. Loud noises. Busy places. There’s a fullness in my head almost constantly. I’ve had two more episodes similar to 10/1 as well throughout this time that were really intense and feel like all of the blood and oxygen are draining from my head for a few seconds. 

I have an SVT that’s been dormant for over a year. I had one significant episode in my life in Jan 2024 but two days after this started I had another episode. I also had another SVT on 10/16. But my HR was normal all day the day the dizziness began beforehand. About two weeks into this I developed non-stop tinnitus which I’ve never had before either. For about a week I had significant pressure at the base of my skull into my neck when I would lay down but that mostly subsided. I have difficulty focusing my vision and have a left eye tremor/twitch going on. 

Since this started I’ve been to the PCP twice who said it was probably related to my SVT. I went to the cardiologist who said it was probably an ear issue. I went to an ENT who did the pike maneuver only and said it wasn’t the ear and if it was it would’ve shown on an mri I had back in May? He recommended nuero. I went to eye dr and he said eyes look fine. I went to urgent care who also recommended nuero. Went to ER, had head CT (no contrast), chest CTA and neck CT. They didn’t find anything related to the ear. I went to the neurologist who also dismissed it because my CT was clear. I had multiple rounds of bloodwork throughout the month of Oct and could see a slow spike throughout of a possible infection (WBC/Neutrophils elevated) but they said it was likely due to “anxiety”. My phosphorus was low at the hospital no clue why so they gave me a supplement and sent me on my way. I read that could cause dizziness so I was hopeful this was the solution but fortunately it is at normal range now but unfortunately I’m still off. 

I read that SSRIs can help with this imbalance so I started Prozac a few weeks ago. I tried testing my glucose for days and BP to see if it was hypoglycemia. I switched to eating 5-6 whole food healthy meals and snacks day which made it worse. I stopped drinking coffee. I’m forcing myself to go places even if I vomit in the public restrooms. I’m taking vitamin b12 and D. I’ve been on a 30 day heart monitor since the 22nd but no calls of any issues. 

I had Covid in August and I suffer with chronic illness since I was a kid but this is the straw that’s breaking the camels back after two years of dealing with other ailments and doctors for unrelated issues I’m so burnt out on the doctors appointments and being dismissed as is. 

I read that PPPD is where it’s worse upright so I don’t know if this is it since I feel better standing. Not 100% but def better than sitting or laying down. Im just loosing my mind.

“That might be a problem. I want two.” Dan said. 

Amy looks at him, “don’t you dare toy with me Mr, I have been trying to work up the courage since Saturday morning to talk about this! If you think you’re being funny your not. I will walk out of this house and out of your life for fucking ever!”

Dan says, “Come here and holds his arms open.”

“Talk to me Dan. I’m not buying this.  Two kids that’s a bullshit answer.”

“Come here and let me explain. Okay?”

“ This is going to take a lot of explaining.” Amy said as she slid into the bed. Her bull shit radar on high alert.  

“Since Tracy passed I’ve had a lot of time to think about being alone versus in a relationship. After a lot of soul searching I decided I wanted someone in my life. With a person my age there would be a lot of baggage. Family, financial, emotional even sexual. Not saying for a high value individual that it wouldn’t be worth it. Problem is I’m picky. Just not any pretty face would do.”

Amy shook her head in understanding. Dan continued. 

“When I thought about someone younger, there is still baggage. Hopefully not as much but still things to unpack. So a high value woman, someone I want in my life for the next 30 or 40 years might very well love my family but wants one of her own.”

Amy starts to speak but stops and sits in silence. 

“I struggled with that for a long time. Am I to old for this? Then one day it dawns on me.  It’s not my decision. If someone loves me enough to want to have an old man’s baby when they can’t get all assets, would mean they are serious. I have legal documents protecting everything and everyone even the baby.  I also think is very important for a child to have a sibling.”  

Amy buries her face in Dan’s shoulder. The tears flow. Tears of relief, tears of joy, tears of appreciation for a man in her life that steadies the ship. 

“Your original answer caught me off guard.”

“There is so much to unpack with this. But yes I would like a second go at fatherhood.”

They cuddle together and once again everything seems right with the world. 

The five o’clock alarm goes off. Putting an end to Sunday afternoon sex. They hurry up and get ready to go to Rachel and Ben’s. 

It was a great evening of food, fun and nonsense. At 7:30 it was time for the little people to get ready for bed. So Dan, Amy and Kayla headed home. Dan went right away to do the few evening chores. Mean while Amy talked to Kayla who was packing to 
head back to college. 

“So you and Dad. Is it a real thing or just a fun time?” Kayla asks but not sure she wants to know the answer. 

“Oh it’s real. It might even be realer than I ever imagined.” Amy can’t help but smile. 

“Good. I think you would be a great step mom!” Kayla says, going in for a hug. 

Those words hit Amy right in the heart. She can’t help but to start crying. Which makes Kayla start crying. They hug as Dan walks in. He doesn’t say a word. Just throws his arms around the two of them.  Kisses each one top of the head and turns around and leaves. 

They all say their goodbyes and watch Kayla head down the lane and onto the road. 

“Fire pit time.” Dan says. 

“You asking or telling me?” Amy asks. 

“Tonight is telling.  We just announced to the world today that we are together. Half the state knows about us by now. We need to talk about the real world and how we navigate it. Steve even got a call asking what the hell his Dad was thinking chasing a 30 year old woman.”

The color washed out of Amy’s face. “What did he say?”

Dan laughed. He told them, “Shit! He’s to old to chase. He just sits back and waits for them to come to him.”

Amy laughed as they walked to the fire pit hand in hand. 

XOXOXO

The alarm went off at 5:30. Dan went to make coffee while Amy hopped in the shower. In a few minutes Dan walks into the bathroom with two cups of coffee and opens the shower door. Just standing there smiling. 

“Is one of the coffees for me?” Amy asks. 

“Nope.” Taking a sip. 

“Why are you in here then?” More than a little annoyed. 

 “I think you know why.” Taking another sip of coffee. 

“Explain it to me. It’s Monday and I haven’t had coffee yet.”

Dan takes a sip of coffee. “See I have this smoking hot girlfriend that looks delicious when she is in the shower naked and all soapy.” Takes another sip of coffee, smiles and sets them on the counter.  Drops his shorts and steps into the shower. 

“What are you doing! I’m going to be late for work.”

“I’ll call your boss and let him know.” Amy rolls her eyes at him. As she is pulled in close. She knows this one isn’t going to be slow and seductive. This is a man who has one thing on his mind.  They share a deep kiss as his one hand cups her ass and the other starts rubbing her kitty.  He is rubbing hard and fast trying to make her cum so he can use her. Knowing what will push her over the edge, he leans over and sucks a nipple and piercing into his mouth. Slowly her lips are parted and a finger slips in and starts messaging her G spot. 

Amy begins to gush as she moans “Fuck, your getting good at that!” The next thing she knows she is bent over at the waist. 

The Silver Fox slowly slides his cock into her beautiful kitty and starts pumping in and out. “I need you Baby Girl. This wasn’t planned but I saw you here naked and beautiful in the shower.” Amy moans as she can feel it building. 

“I couldn’t resist this body.” Dan could feel his cock enlarge. 

“Come with me Daddy!” Is all it took. As ropes of cum filled her pussy.

 “Oh fuck.” Amy moans. Pushing her ass back into Dan. Wanting all of him in her. 

They stood there holding each other under the shower as they came down. Then sharing a soft kiss.

I rarley use milk, no tea or coffee just protein shakes and the occasional bowl of cereal. Last night I had a bowl of cereal and noticed we only had one carton of milk left in the fridge and it was only about 1/3 full. I wondered when my mum was going to buy some more and if I should go out tomorrow and buy some. 

Fast forward to the day after (today) - around 5pm I choose to have another bowl of cereal, I notice no one has got new milk and it’s the same carton of milk from yesterday, this time even less full, I feel the weight of it, I look for more milk in the fridge and there is none, I take special note of this in my head because my mum n her boyfriend drink so much tea + coffee they would be very annoyed if I used the last of it. The cereal took priority anyway haha so I used a little bit and left a tiny bit left in there (maybe enough for one drink) 

Skip forward 2 hours, my mum n her boyfriend have been taking a nap this whole time n haven’t been awake long, I go back in the fridge whilst my mum is in the kitchen and notice 2 full cartons of milk (one opened, one not) , I say oh you went shopping huh when did you do that? This morning she says. She says they have been here since the morning and I explain to her how that’s impossible because of all of the above (my whole moral dilemma around using the last of the milk) - she swears by it, she is not lying and there is no reasonable time where they could of snuck out to buy it as they were asleep. 

There is no reasonable that makes sense, I have no carbon monoxide poisoning (well I don’t show any other signs lol) and I know what I saw, felt, thought about. I am well informed on string theory, shifting, a lot of things spiritual so my first thought was this sub and shifting, what do u think?

Adèle was in a hallway, but it was unlike any she had ever seen. The walls were made of a material that looked like polished, dark wood, yet it swirled with faint, internal luminescent patterns, like a nebula trapped in varnish. The floor was soft, carpeted in a deep, plush material that muffled her footsteps completely.
Whoa, Adèle thought, her mind struggling to catch up. Can I even get a breakfast in this place?
She’d been picturing a creaky staircase, a communal dining room with mismatched chairs, maybe a kettle and some instant coffee. Where are the lovely pensioner women, the kind who crowd and make warm places like this, even though they're threadbare? The ones who would offer you a biscuit and ask about your studies?
This place... it was silent. Spotless. Perfect. There wasn't a speck of dust, not a single scuff mark on the wall. Like, is this some thing the super rich do or have? Some level of existence so sublime she couldn't even comprehend it?
It wasn't ""spooky"" in the way of cobwebs or creaking floors. It was the opposite. It was a terrifying, absolute, sterile perfection. She almost felt like turning around to push open the door she'd come through, to find and touch reality again—even the cold, dark gravel path felt more real than this.
This felt like she slipped into some place she was not privileged to have access to, like a normal person accidentally wandering into a billionaire's secret, futuristic vault. She half-expected another chime, another digital voice telling her ""Error: Occupancy not authorized.""
But the hallway was silent, offering only a choice: left or right.

She drifted down the hall, each step a conscious effort. This place wasn't just new; it was ancient. The mansion was perfect in every detail.
She passed a towering bookcase, the dark wood polished to a mirror finish. The books themselves, bound in aged leather, seemed to hum with potential. Even the chairs set in small alcoves cried out their history and provenance; she could almost see the hands that had carved the intricate legs, the forgotten inspirations that led to their design.
It was both solid—the weight of centuries pressed into every object—and dizzying. She felt small, a piece of temporary dust in a permanent gallery.
But the awe was secondary to the crushing exhaustion. She reached the end of the hall and looked up. A grand staircase, carpeted in the same silent, plush material, curved up into the darkness. She put a hand on the bannister to steady herself.
She just hoped her legs had enough strength to climb up and find a room. All she wanted was to collapse upon a bed and let the strangeness of this place fade to black.

1os7g89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1os7g89/the_highway_of_bad_decisions_why_we_ignore_sane/,The Highway of Bad Decisions: Why We Ignore Sane Advice,"**Have you ever wondered why people don’t listen to sane advice? Advice that is good, easy to follow, backed by common sense, evidenced by examples both good and bad. There is no shortage of such advice on this planet. There are enough experienced people, books, videos, and even laws meant to help people avoid the path of folly.**

**But people still don’t get it and it could be frustrating. Isn’t it so simple just to follow time tested advice and instruction to make life better? Instead, humans of all ages — including me!! — are known to exhibit such numbing of the mind. What could be some of the underlying factors contributing to this behavior? I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this, and I believe these three reasons explain this strange, stubborn habit of the human mind.**

1. **The Brain is a Creature of Habit (and a Master Rationalizer)**

Growing up, when we first disregard an instruction and get into trouble, our brain goes into **self-defense mode**. It explains to itself that

a) “You were innocent”

b) “You didn’t mean to cause trouble”

c) “Not everything is lost and nothing bad has really happened.”

d) “There is always a way to recover it later, or the loss did not matter much.”

This self-defense mechanism of our brain is actually well designed or else we would for ever live in remorse and regret. However, when this trait of our brain is repeatedly abused or misused to rationalize disregard for instructions, it forms a pattern over a period of time — **a dangerous pattern of ignoring advice and then rationalizing it**. And, our brains love to form patterns, habits and routines!

**How to Break the Pattern?**

Such patterns eventually exhibit themselves in passive aggressive behaviors where people find it very difficult to ingest advice or instructions into their minds and implement it. How do we prevent or undo such patterns? There are many ways of preventing or breaking such patterns and I propose only a couple here.

**For younger Minds:**

Parents and guardians need to clearly, gently and firmly explain that while the disregard did not cause a great material loss, it is indeed a transgression of the mind. They need to leverage the fact that the brain is a creature of habit and make it a pattern in the young minds to value advice and instruction irrespective of the potential loss ignoring it may cause.

**For adults:**

We need to recognize the nature of the brain and consciously make changes to our decision making processes. It is necessary to pause and heed to prevailing advice relevant to the decision at hand and incorporate it as one of the deciding factors. When this is done consistently it will result in **reprogramming the brain** to be sensitive to advice and exhortation rather than growing numb to it.

**2. The Thrill of Adventure vs. The Lure of Folly**

A great many places have been discovered, innovations have been made, treasures found, and lost cultures revived by people seeking adventure. By challenging the norms. By venturing beyond the set boundaries into the unknown. It’s an innate quality of every human to wonder what is unknown and go after it. That is essential for progress.

However the flip side of it is also equally dangerous.

When warned not to touch a live wire, you don’t want to wonder how it would feel to be electrocuted and actually try it! Same goes with warnings about not getting too close to the edge of a cliff, aggressive driving, reckless relationships, substance abuse and violating moral codes in the **name of adventure and excitement**.

When people venture out against these boundaries in the name of thrill and adventure, the results are there for everyone to see — lost lives, broken relationships, moral bankruptcy to name a few. The thrill of adventure needs to be leveraged for good — not to the detriment of our bright future!

**3. The Lure of the Successful Rebel**

Advertisements, advertisements, advertisements! Forget the media advertisements for a moment. I’m talking about the advertising done by **people who have been there and done that!** Your friends, relatives, colleagues, or a stranger at the coffee shop — if any of them has gone down the path of a rebel and disregarded any of the social, moral, legal and medical boundaries and lived to tell a story… boy! That is one heck of a narrative.

Simply stated, the story of a rebel who narrates it as a **success** is way more powerful than the one narrated as a lesson to be learnt. There’s nothing wrong with listening to personal stories — they are powerful and true — but we must choose wisely!

Choose what you let into your ears, and mind and eventually, your heart. What I mean by this is that **we need to be diligent about curating the relationships we build!** We need to build relationships in a such a way that spending time with them not only fosters healthy thinking patterns in us, but also witness firsthand how people **benefit** from heeding to good counsel. Surround yourself with people with a zest for life, adventure and a pragmatic approach to thinking outside the box.

You’ve got the batter ready, the toppings are prepped, and the coffee is brewing. But then, the bottleneck appears: the single waffle maker.

One waffle at a time. The first one is ready and getting cold on a plate while the second one is still cooking. By the time the fourth person gets a waffle, the first is a lukewarm shadow of its former glory. We've all been there.

It’s a ritual that, frankly, drains the joy out of what should be a relaxing, delicious meal. For years, I just accepted this as the ""way things were."" Then, I discovered something that completely changed the way I do weekend breakfast: the double waffle maker.

---

## The Single Waffle Maker Struggle is Real

Before we sing the praises of the double-sided hero, let's acknowledge the very real frustrations of its single-sided cousin.

> It's not just about waiting. It’s about the cold waffles, the breakfast backlog, and the feeling that you're running a short-order diner instead of enjoying a meal with your family.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=double%20waffle%20maker)

- **The Waiting Game:** Making waffles for a family of four means you're standing over that machine for a solid 15-20 minutes, flipping, pouring, and waiting.
- **The First Waffle Sacrifice:** The first waffle is always the test run. It’s either undercooked or the perfect temp, but you know the next one will be different.
- **The Cold Plate Pile-Up:** You can either make everyone eat as they come out (disjointed and chaotic) or you can stack them on a plate in a warm oven (where they get soggy). Neither is ideal.

This system is broken. And the fix is surprisingly simple.

## Enter the Double Waffle Maker: A Breakfast Revolution

Upgrading to a double waffle maker feels like switching from a dial-up modem to high-speed internet. The core job is the same, but the efficiency and experience are worlds apart.

This isn't just about making two waffles instead of one. It's about fundamentally changing the flow of your morning.

### Cut Your Cook Time in Half

This is the most obvious benefit, but it’s worth shouting from the rooftops. Two waffles cook simultaneously. That breakfast-for-four mission is now done in two batches instead of four. You’re literally saving ten minutes of active cooking time. That’s ten more minutes to sip your coffee, actually talk to your kids, or just sit down.

### Everyone Eats Hot, Together

This is the real magic. You can place two perfect, golden-brown waffles on a plate and serve two people at the exact same time. Then, you make the next two. No one is left eating a cold, sad waffle. It turns a disjointed assembly line into a shared, warm meal. The simple act of eating together makes the food taste better.

### Consistency is King

Because both waffle cavities are heating and cooking at the same time, you get incredibly consistent results. Both waffles will have the same texture, the same color, and the same level of crispiness. You can finally say goodbye to, ""Oh, you got the 'good' one.""

### More Than Just Waffles

This is where a good double waffle maker becomes a true multi-tool. Once you have that large, double-sided cooking surface, you start seeing possibilities everywhere.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=double%20waffle%20maker)

- **Hash Browns:** Get perfectly crispy restaurant-style hash brown patties.
- **Grilled Cheese:** A double grilled cheese maker? Yes, please. Even browning on both sides without flipping.
- **Panini and Quesadillas:** Press two perfect sandwiches at once for a quick lunch.

I’ve even seen some of the more clever models with reversible plates that turn into a griddle. It’s this kind of versatility that makes it one of those kitchen tools I wish I'd found sooner. It earns its counter space.

## What to Look for in a Great Double Waffle Maker

If you're convinced and ready to upgrade, here are a few things that separate the good from the great.

1.  **Rotating Design:** Many double waffle makers rotate 180 degrees. This helps spread the batter evenly and ensures a uniform golden-brown crust on both sides. It's a small feature that makes a big difference.
2.  **Non-Stick Coating:** This is non-negotiable. A quality non-stick surface means your waffles release cleanly and cleanup is just a simple wipe-down.
3.  **Adjustable Browning Control:** A dial that lets you choose your desired level of crispiness is essential. Some days you want a light and fluffy waffle; others, you want it crunchy.
4.  **Clear Indicator Lights:** You don’t want to guess. A ""preheat"" light and a ""ready"" light take all the mystery out of the timing.
5.  **Drip Tray:** A good model will have a tray to catch any overflowing batter. This saves you a huge cleanup headache.
6.  **Storage:** If counter space is tight, look for a model with a locking handle that allows you to store it on its side.

## The Bottom Line: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

If you make waffles more than a few times a year, the answer is an emphatic yes.

A double waffle maker is more than just a gadget; it's a quality-of-life improvement for your kitchen. It gives you back your time, eliminates morning stress, and allows you to actually enjoy the food you worked so hard to make.

It’s one of those rare tools that solves a problem so effectively you wonder how you ever lived without it. It's the secret weapon for effortless brunches and happy, well-fed mornings all around.",1,1762654489.0,WaffleNationHQ,0,1.0,False

Yes, my first batch was only 12 queries but they’re all between 2-3 months of at this point and I was hoping to at least get one bite. I worked on my query with a writer friend after the last time I posted here but I was hoping for some fresh eyes. Thank you for any insight you can provide!

Dear Agent,

I am seeking representation for my 93k word romance novel, HOW YOU HEAR ME. With a genre-bent concept similar to Ashley Poston’s Sounds Like Love combined with the sweet college romance of Christina Lauren’s Tangled Up in You, HOW YOU HEAR ME is a slow-burn love story written dual POV with a dose of millennial nostalgia.

Adria Holzen is still recovering from last semester’s downward spiral. After a mental health crisis left her with a plummeting GPA and zero self-esteem, she still can’t let go of her dream of becoming a teacher. If she’s going to make it into her university’s teaching program, she’s going to have to make everyone believe she had her life together—including herself.

When Rowan Briggs is paired with Adria for a semester-long project, he’s less than thrilled. Rowan is a mind reader, albeit a reluctant one. Sure, he occasionally uses his hearing to his advantage, but after a lifetime of seeing his mother manipulate everyone with her own gift, he’s terrified of becoming like her. So Rowan goes about college like he does everything else— suppressing his ability and keeping everyone at arm’s length.

But when Rowan saves Adria from ruining their first presentation, she begins to suspect something is different about him. Rowan is quiet and observant, able to sense her anxiety even when she’s sure she’s kept it hidden. Before long, the hours spent researching create an undeniable spark. Rowan’s soft spot for Adria scares him— after watching his own parent’s marriage destroyed by the ability he inherited, he has vowed not to get close to anyone. Now as the deadline for her teaching application comes close, Adria feels herself begin to spiral again. With their time together ending, Adria and Rowan must decide if having someone know the real version of themselves is worth compromising the facades they’ve depended on for so long.

Like my protagonist, I attended university to become a teacher. I received a bachelor’s in English/Language Arts from \[University\] Today I live in \[state\] with my husband and our four children. When I’m not writing, I enjoy reading, baking, and drinking far too much iced coffee.

First 300:

Of all the things that should have bothered Adria, arriving at the wrong classroom shouldn’t have even made the list. A year ago she might have been able to play it off, shrugged her shoulders and continued on her way. But there it was: the blotchy, scathing heat beginning to crawl up her neck, announcing to everyone just how well she was handling things.

Adria ducked into the computer lab. The room itself was small enough that it may have been a closet at some point; just three computer stations in a windowless space by the stairwell. She perched herself on a chair and typed in her password. The homescreen appeared.

Taking a breath, she felt around her pockets until she was able to locate the half crumpled schedule that had hung on her cork board since July, too early, it turned out, to be depended on. Adria snatched a stray pen from the station next to hers, scrawling the room number on the back of the paper.

By the time she left the lab, she had less than a minute. In front of her, the last few people in the hall retreated into classrooms. Adria checked the room number again, trying not to think of how many problems would disappear if she just got in her car and left. She’d be home in less than three hours. Her parents could redeposit thousands of dollars into their savings account and it would soften the blow of their oldest daughter giving up her dream of being a teacher. It wouldn’t matter that she was late, or that she already had too much homework. And she could stop worrying every time she recognized someone who was there during spring exams. ",2,1762654462.0,PubTips,12,1.0,False

I've gone through different seasons in this journey since I found my way home back to Christ and His one true Catholic Church almost 3 years ago. At first it was a slow gradual process of just giving God a chance and seeing Him work in me and life through consolations. Then I wanted to learn as much as possible, pray as much as possible, to the point where I kind of burned myself out by trying to (wrongly) complete a daily checklist. Then I started getting too spiritually slothful and stressed from life, my prayer life tanked and basically stopped, now I've been trying to make it a routine again, trying to find a balance I suppose.

Before elaborating, I recognize I have opportunities to work towards that effects my discipline, energy, and motivation, mainly the amount and quality of my sleep, also some difficulty with attention. Naturally, I find almost everything easier to do if I have coffee or an energy drink before, including prayer. I'll be exhausted or grumpy, ready to just say ""tomorrow"" again until I have a little caffeine and then I can focus and really pray rather than just say words or just pray at all.

I know it's not ideally healthy, I don't have caffeine too close to my bedtime, I think my sleep debt is just too built up right now and it's going to take a lot of time and effort, but this is where I find myself at currently and I'm trying to do best with that. 

I know I don't need and shouldn't want anything other than God, nor should I need or want anything to engage in prayer to spend time with Him other than the simple desire to be united with and to please God.

How incorrect is this in your opinion? If there any biblical sources regarding this, please let me know, I would greatly appreciate it! On the contrary, am I just being scrupulous? Any feedback welcome, thanks!",0,1762654322.0,Catholicism,7,0.4,False

Considering a move from CLE Heights to Brecksville and want to source thoughts on the area. In the Heights we’re able to walk to coffee, Shaker Nature Center, etc and we’re a 10m drive from museums and playgrounds. I’m worried about moving out to Brecksville and feeling really isolated.

I feel invisible in a world full of people. My sadness is so intense that it is making me feel social anxiety. I’m worried about people talking to me and coming off as weird or someone being rude and just making me feel worse.

Typically i’m not worried but the emptiness is making me feel sensitive. Every night and weekend is long.. i cry myself to sleep and try to position my arms in a way that mimics a hug from another person.

I don’t know when i will be healed. It was 5 years together. A large part is my fault. I wonder since she detached a while ago if i’m just a memory and have lost all emotional meaning to her. I don’t feel special anymore. Everyday is just another day of me trying to survive.

Anyway, winter’s here, so it’s back to working indoors. :)

1os78tb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1os78tb,"My experience at all the Traveler's Factory at Tokyo (Narita, Tokyo Station, Nakameguro) & Kyoto, +Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo (because might as well 😅).","I was in Kyoto and Tokyo last year and went back to Tokyo a few weeks ago. This is my collective experience at all 4 Traveler’s Factory locations, including the Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Tokyo.

 In case you want more info and tips, it’s on my YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb1VGsRB8lw&list=PL3syVOqSrHDdS9CfejogH2HNv9YATrkwX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb1VGsRB8lw&list=PL3syVOqSrHDdS9CfejogH2HNv9YATrkwX)

 **1.  Narita Airport**

\- I really think this is overall the best of all 3 locations in Tokyo – it’s not crowded, has the full standard line up and more, and has my favorite souvenir – the gachapon machine that spews out the special pins. If you go here, I don’t think you need to go to the other locations, unless to specifically get the exclusive editions found at some of the other locations.

\- Exclusive Traveler’s Notebooks that you only get here:

1. Brown Regular cover and the accompany insert (MD cream,64 pages, can be purchased separately);

2. Black passport cover and accompany insert (MD cream, 64 pages, can be purchased separately);

3. 12 types of luggage stickers. If you buy more than five, you get a discount;

4. A postcard featuring a variety of information about Narita Airport;

5. 4 exclusive washi tape designs;

6. Leather folder by Butler Verner Sails, in Regular and Passport size with an airplane embossing.

\-  This needs the most planning if you want to visit this store. Narita Airport has 3 terminals. The Traveler’s Factory store is located at Terminal 1. You cannot walk from Terminal 2 or 3 to Terminal 1. You can take the inter-terminal shuttle but that does not operate 24/7 and due to traffic, you could be stuck on the road for a while.

\- The store is located in the shopping area before security check so plan to get here well before you need to check-in because it’s not a short walk from here to the check-in counters.



 **2. Tokyo Station**

\- The most crowded and the hardest to locate! Still has the full standard line up.

\-Exclusive Traveler’s Notebooks that you only get here:

1. Tokyo station Regular cover and the accompanying insert (MD cream, 64 pages, can be purchased separately);

2. Gold embossed Regular insert, showcasing the Marunouchi building (MD cream, 64 pages);

3. 2 letter-pressed stickers;

4. The brass  tag featuring the Marunouchi building;

5. 1 exclusive washi tape.

6. Tokyo station is the cotton canvas bag.

7. Leather folder done by Butler Verner Sails, in Regular and Passport size, featuring a train motif.

\-The most convenient location for most visitors to Tokyo. There is a big mechanical press for stamping, featuring the Marunouchi building.



**3. Nakameguro**

\- The first ever flagship store. Located in a lovely neighbourhood in Tokyo. There are lots of really cool boutiques featuring Japan brands. I would highly recommend exploring the neighbourhood shops (they are on the higher-priced side though) here if you are planning to visit the Nakameguro store.

\-  It has two floors. The upper floor is the sitting and workshop area and is only open to people who purchase a drink from the sales counter on the first floor.

\- No exclusive covers or inserts :( They did have leather folders by Butler Verner Sails, in Regular and Passport size, featuring coffee decanters. I don’t know if any of these leather folders are permanent though. I hadn’t noticed them during my last trip to Japan. They also have a postbox where you can mail a postcard to yourself.

\- If there are a lot of visitors, you will have to queue up outside. The sales associate will let in people one at a time.

\- Closed on Tuesdays.



**4. Starbucks Reserve Roastery**

\- 10 minutes away from the Nakameguro Traveler’s Factory location. On busy days, you will have to get in queue by scanning the QR code that is placed outside a building that’s next to the Roastery. You can also pre-book your ticket on the Japan Starbucks website - [https://www.starbucks.co.jp/reserve/roastery/entry-guide/?srsltid=AfmBOorHRvMo-79kEFpe5Mn5EPgrsLJGP\_BtAIVCB0Ldlkb7NnAaV9SG](https://www.starbucks.co.jp/reserve/roastery/entry-guide/?srsltid=AfmBOorHRvMo-79kEFpe5Mn5EPgrsLJGP_BtAIVCB0Ldlkb7NnAaV9SG)

\- Exclusive Traveler’s Notebooks that you only get here:

1.  3 Regular leather covers, Camel, Blue and Brown, with plain inserts.

2. 2 Passport covers, Camel and Blue, with regular standard inserts.

3.  3 exclusive regular size inserts –

o   64 pages, craft paper

o   64 pages, dot grid paper

o   64 pages blank, cream paper.

4. 2 exclusive passport size inserts -

o   64 pages, blank cream insert

o   Card file, 20 pages.

5. 4 exclusive charms – copper Sakura charm,  brass coffee mug, pewter coffee bag and a brass charm with the R for ‘Reserve Roastery’.

6.  Brass clip;

7. Brass ballpoint pen;

8. Brass book mark clip set featuring coffee;

9. 3 washi tapes.

10.  2 roll-sticker tapes

11.  Coffee sticker set containing 9 stickers.

 

**5. Kyoto**

\-  The biggest of all Traveler’s Factory stores, and my favourite! Located in a lovely complex that used to house the old Kyoto Telephone Exchange office.

\-  Exclusive Traveler’s Notebooks that you only get here:

1. Blue Kyoto Regular size cover that comes with a special insert (can be purchased separately);

2. 3 exclusive inserts. One is made from green tea leaves;

3. 2 brass charms;

4. A cotton bag

5. Butler Vener Sails leather folders in Regular and Passport.

Overall, loved all the locations! But there seems to a sort of palpable ‘shift’ in atmosphere… during my trip last year, the sales associate were really lovely and helpful, and they were equally professional this time around, but they seemed a bit more intense and scrutinizing and I believe it’s because of the problem of re-sellers. I completely understand why they have the checks that they have in place . Feel free to ask me any questions you may have about the stores!

New to this subreddit, but glad it exists. I'm looking for friends and possibly a casual partner who is around my age. I'm looking to form connections with people in the city who are serious about meeting up in person, getting coffee, dinner, etc. This online scene can be isolating with all of the 1 day conversations and ghosting. I'd like to meet people in person so we can get a sense of each other without having to talk necessarily. Where we can feel the vibe/energy, you know.

A little about me: born and raised in Chicagoland (grew up in the south suburbs, lived on the northside in my adult years). I am currently back at home with my mom so that I can complete my master's degree (May '26!) without having to work full time. But I'll be back in the city sometime next year 😁. Chicago is truly my favorite city.

But anyway, if you're also tired of wading through the online garbage and getting back to socializing in person, don't be afraid to reach out!

1os72yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/myocarditis/comments/1os72yn/any_uplifting_stories/,Any uplifting stories?,"I’m 23 y/o F. Two months ago i ended up in the hospital for chest and right arm pain, i was already feeling this pain for almost two weeks on and off before going in. They did an ekg and didn’t find nothing till they did a blood test and my troponin level was at 3,400. I was in the hospital for 6 days and had a cath done with not answers. The cardiologist they prescribed to me never answered my calls. I went to my primary care doctor and he put me in contact with a different cardiologist. The never cardiology right away diagnosed me with myoperi (he was right) and put me on colchicine. The colchicine did help but i did have a couple episodes even after starting it still. I do feel better now, i been on colchicine for about a month and half. However i don’t trust my doctor because even though my last appointment with him i told him i had some pains around that time he told me i’m good to get back to exercising and i even asked him if i can participate in combat sports and he told me yes i can do everything now. When i got diagnosed i asked is there any foods to avoid - sugars, coffee, etc? He said no. I know that was not true because if i listened to his advice i would be worse off right now and i had an episode after that anyway (when i said episode i mean i was at home feeling very bad). He also put me on aspirin and colchicine but the aspirin only for two weeks. The colchicine for 3 months. He did a blood test to make sure i didn’t have an autoimmune disease that caused this. He also did an electro ultrasound which he said my heart is strong and fine. Anytime i would ask him to do an MRI he would say it’s too expensive and not worth it. At first he said no because i didn’t have insurance but even after i got my insurance he said it would cost too much. My next follow up appointment isn’t for another year. I also have no choice but to get back to work like a week after leaving the hospital but thankfully i work an office job. 

That’s my background story. This has been stressful because i wanted to go into boxing, marathons, etc and now i feel like that has been taken away from me. I don’t know if i’ll ever be able to do that or be at 100% again. I don’t even know if i can travel or go back to my other job which required me being around many people, physically demanding, and the fear of getting sick. There is so many mixed answers about life expectancy and what can and can’t be done once you contact this. There is the worry it could come back. Before the doctor told me i can’t excerise i remember carrying a heavy box up the stairs and feeling out of breath and got chest pain. Before i went to the hospital i was doing a workout like a week prior and drinking and smoking. I hope i didnt fuck myself up and got permanent scarring or anything. I dont even know if i wanna get the mri anymore and find out whether i still got anything permanent or not. Does anybody have any inspirational or uplifting stories? Any advice is welcome as well.

My favorite and least favorite part of Moonie’s was the buns. They were the best-tasting part of the burger…and they were the best-tasting part of the burger. The patty was school-cafeteria grade, and the veggies couldn’t match what I’m used to from P. Terry’s and even In-n-Out. The fries were good, but I made the mistake of getting the loaded version, which really weren’t worth the upcharge for nacho cheese and dried up jalapeños I could’ve swore they sourced from a neglected movie theater popcorn station. I reckon this was a case of not going to the right location since this one looked a little more hole-in-the-wall compared to others I’ve seen, but I feel like the quality can’t be that different — they’re likely using all of the same ingredients from the same place. I felt like I was scammed into paying so much for something that would be bodied by literally any other burger chain I can think of.

Phoebe’s Diner wasn’t egregious at all, but i went there with a group of 3 and we all left just feeling OK about it, which sucked since we’ve been thinking of hitting that spot for a while. Everything just tasted so damn *sweet*; the gravy, the pickles, the biscuits, etc. It tasted like they tossed a spoonful of sugar into everything. The biscuits especially were quite upsetting, as they were just these huge sweet spongecake-like blocks with no texture to them. The coffee was also extremely watery and lukewarm, but honestly it was cheap enough that I don’t really care about that part.

For example when I had a partner, it was easy for me to feel confident, secure and safe enough to plan a solo overseas trip. Without my ex I don’t even feel safe enough to go to the grocery store or my favorite coffee shop alone. I accomplished a lot while with my ex, and I felt safe enough to do anything I wanted to. Now I can’t even carry out daily tasks.

I can’t quite figure out what it is that I’m scared of. It’s more so a feeling of not belonging, of being an outsider who might be judged and ridiculed or laughed at. It feels similar to insecurity. Part of thinks that this has to do with the lack of self identity and self image caused by BPD. 

Because of this, I’m basically choosing to bed rot and stay home instead of doing anything productive. Friends invite me to a show, I say no because it feels scary. I need to meal prep, I don’t go to the grocery store because it feels scary. I want to plan a trip for the holidays, I don’t because it feels scary. I used to enjoy working at a cafe and going to the gym, now even the thought of stepping foot in a cafe or gym terrifies me because I feel so incredibly alone and insecure.

Having the knowledge that I have BPD has made it even worse because I’m extra self aware of the fact that I don’t have a favorite person no more.

My MRI and both EEGs came back normal but my Dr said that doesn’t rule out epilepsy.  I was diagnosed with TLE.  I was having siezures every other month for about a year and a half before I finally got to see a neurologist and he said it really does sound like TLE.  I haven’t had any siezures in about 2 months (and now would be about the time I’d have one since they are pretty consistent with every 2 months).  
But this medication is making me feel so weird I almost wonder if I’d rather have the 6 siezure days a year rather than feel like this.  I’m always staring off into space.  Can’t remember what I’m doing.  Forget things I should know.  My legs and hands are always moving.  Or I’m constantly tapping my fingers.   And I keep smelling cat pee.  We have cats so that doesn’t seem so odd.  But no one else smells it.  Today I smelled like every surface of my house trying to find where the smell is coming from.   Never did find it.  Then my husband made a cup of coffee and the cat pee smell was even stronger.

I just keep asking myself : Why does everyone despise me?

I  can't stop thinking about it. Ever since I was a kid I was always despised and mocked by adults and children alike. But why? Why me? Why can't I just be normal? Why don't I have the right to laugh with others, go on vacation with others, got to bars and coffee shops with others? 

I don't feel so different from them. When I watch people in the street, or I see Youtubers a,d Twitch streamers talking, it seems so easy to be normal and yet, when I actually try to talk to them, it's like they're talking to an alien.

This is why I don't work. This is why I didn't go back to uni after dropping out. This is why I stopped talking to everyone and started isolating. I remember what I felt now. I couldn't stand it anymore. The relentless little reproaches about every little thing I do, the constant denigration of every opinion I expressed, even the most trivial ones and above all, above all, those caustic little laughs, oh how I hate those petty little laughs. Why are they all smiling like this? I wish I could just break their necks and watch their heads ragdoll around like the pesky little jack-in-the-box they are.

My family, my parents, my (ex) friends even strangers I had never met before they all called me retarded and made fun of me behind my back. Why? What is wrong with me? Is it something about my face, my stance? I'm not very expressive, and I do have slow reactions.. Is it my social anxiety? People can see that I'm scared of them not liking me, so they take that as a signal to bully me. Is it that I really am retarded? After high school I had a lot of trouble with my classes, and I've always sucked at everything. I've always been lightheaded and clumsy.  

People in hs used to say that I looked ""nice"", they would mimic me by exaggerating my mental retardation and then say ""What are we going to do with you?""

If I really am mentally retarded then what is the point of living? I can't have normal relationships with other people, they treat me like a cockroach. 

There is no happiness possible in these conditions, but I can't end myself either because it would make them soooo happy. They would smile and laugh again, with their vicious little sarcastic laughs.

I hate them, I hate them so much, that's really the only thing keeping me alive.

Hi guys, how are you guys doing? I (14M) had a relatively big panic attack more than 25 days ago, i actually made one post here talking that one week after i was not feeling 100%, if someone wants to see it leave a comment and i'l send it.

So basically, i had a big attack in October 11 after 1AM and it was so bad that i woke up my parents to stay with them. I already have panick attacks years ago but for more than months (probably more than a year) i didn't have any.

I still fear having an attack, everything now feels more intense. I feel my body more, i feel the air in my mouth, sometimes i am okay but suddenly i feel a random twitch in the muscles or a small flash of pain in the chest 

And everything now is terrifying, i feel something and i want to search if its anxiety related, i'm using too much the pc rn because i had one week without school, and i feel sleepy and think that's an anxiety symptom, i feel some random msucle pain and think that's a anxiety symptom...

I'm trying to drink more coffee and be more careful with myself but, its a hard process, i'l not give up.

I want to do therapy, i'l search for it but, what i want to say its that sometimes i can't just forget it and do another thing, this is scary, i fear that i will in a random day just have a heart attack.

#######

What's happening right now is that minutes ago i started feeling some left arm pain, i touch my muscle and it response to it, probably it's nothing but i think of it and i statt feeling my throat becoming more uncomfortable and my fingers becoming uncomfortable... 

What i do when this happens???? I'l finish this, breathe, drink some water, watch some cool videos and sleep, but i want some advice from u guys.

I'm running a Homebrew Campaign involving a ""Strahd's son"" (bassed off C.o.S. + C.o.S. A.L.) reforming ""the Core"" through conquest. When I have some money go my local store to look for books,  which is where I got Domains and Denizens.
   Context in place, here is my question; Where can I get access to information on The Core's domains?
   Right now I'm mainly using 5e C.o.S +A.L., guide to Ravenloft, and Domains and Denisens for reading material. For YouTube I'm use Hour of the Raven, and PhD&D (side note using horror movies he has recommended as backbones), as well as various videos on general Shadowfell & monsters.

   Don't know if this helps on what information on what information to provide, but here is an example; the party just left Haslic. PHD&D brought up Critters, and Gremlins. I've seen all of Critters, so I latched onto that. And since the theme of the domain is D&D horror, I described the party popping up in an office skyscraper waiting room (real funny having them try to figure out it was a pen & tv remote on the coffee table), and they were described as being Cartoon characters in IRL (never told them they were in a TTRPG game creation office). Once they got ""hired"" by a follower of Haslin (from the PHD&D plot) they got to see more of the classic Haslik. But I had set up 3 encounters for the Critter mission. They wound up doing a Critters 2, with the Critter ball. But if they didn't leave the house they were teleported to, it was set up Critters 1. Aaand~, if they didn't leave the corpret skyscraper, they it Would have been at a Critters 3. Finally thing is that I made Haslin a Beholder Halfling, think the Darlek Human from Doctor Who, that sounded like the bug guy villain from Men in Black 1; halfling because it looks funnier, need to lighten the mood.

1os6rvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1os6rvz/what_are_the_types_of_backpacking_stoves_available/,What are the types of backpacking stoves available?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been getting into backpacking lately, and one thing I quickly learned is that eating cold beans from a can gets old really fast. If you're planning any outdoor adventures, you're gonna need a reliable way to cook your meals on the trail.

Let me break down the main types of backpacking stoves I've researched and used. Trust me, picking the right one makes a huge difference.

**Canister Stoves**

These are probably the most popular ones you'll see on the trail. They screw directly onto small fuel canisters that you can buy at most outdoor stores. They're super lightweight, easy to use, and light up almost instantly. The downside? They don't work great in freezing temperatures, and you can't tell how much fuel is left until it runs out.

**Liquid Fuel Stoves**

These bad boys run on white gas or sometimes even unleaded gasoline. They're more complicated to use (you have to pump and prime them), but they're beasts in cold weather. They're also refillable, which means less waste. I'd recommend these for winter camping or longer expeditions where reliability matters most.

**Alcohol Stoves**

The ultralight crowd loves these. They're basically just simple metal containers that burn denatured alcohol. Super cheap, almost weightless, and silent. But they're slow to boil water and don't put out much heat. Great for minimalist hikers who only need to boil water for dehydrated meals.

**Solid Fuel Stoves**

These use small fuel tablets that look like hockey pucks. They're compact and foolproof, but honestly, they're the slowest option and the fuel costs add up. Good for emergency kits though.

**Wood-Burning Stoves**

Want to go full survival mode? These stoves let you burn twigs and small branches you find around camp. No need to carry fuel at all. The catch is you need dry wood, and they're not allowed in areas with fire restrictions.

If you're ready to grab your own camping stove and start cooking hot meals in the backcountry, I'd recommend checking out some solid options here: https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove. You'll find a bunch of reliable stoves at different price points.

**My Take**

For most weekend warriors and regular backpackers, canister stoves hit the sweet spot between weight, convenience, and performance. They're what I use for 90% of my trips. But if you're heading into serious cold or going on a month-long trek, liquid fuel might be your best bet.

The key is thinking about where you'll camp, how long you'll be out, and what kind of cooking you actually do. Some people just boil water for instant meals, while others want to actually cook real food.

Whatever you choose, having a good portable cooking system opens up way better meal options than granola bars and trail mix. You can browse different camping stove styles and read reviews at https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove to find what works for your adventures.

I work from home but recently was spending several hours in an enclosed room with others each week. I shared several times that I have misophonia and it didn’t seem like other people cared. I eventually asked that everyone please wait until breaks to eat food so that I had an opportunity to leave and not miss anything.

When his lips part the tiniest bit it’s pretty bad but he’s really nice abt it and if I say it’s bothering me he tries to correct and I try to time when I eat crunchy things with him or I’ll distance myself. 

My issue is this - at what point do I stop focusing on “well it’s not their fault, people have to eat” and start feeling like I’m just allowed to be comfortable? I know it’s not my fault that I have this issue either but it feels like I need to accommodate to everyone else not the other way around and I can’t strike a balance.

Create a short, funny, and highly shareable video where the entire story of your day is conveyed using **sound effects only** (no dialogue or text). The goal is to engage viewers through humor, creativity, and relatability while encouraging Reddit users to comment and share interpretations of the sounds.



# Concept

* The video is a **first-person “day in the life”** summary.
* Every action, emotion, or situation is represented with **sound effects instead of words**.
* Example:
   * Alarm clock → “beep beep beep”
   * Coffee spill → “splat”
   * Running late → “cha-ching” or “dun dun dun”
   * Mood changes → laughter, sighs, dramatic booms
* The goal is to **make viewers guess and relate to your day** through humor and creativity.



# Structure

1. **Intro (0:00–0:10)**
   * Quick text overlay: “I Tried Explaining My Day Using Only Sound Effects”
   * Quick hook scene: e.g., dramatic alarm beep chaos, spilled coffee, or running out the door.
2. **Morning (0:10–1:00)**
   * Sounds: alarm, shower, toast popping, coffee machine, rush-out-the-door footsteps.
   * Quick edits and zoom-ins to exaggerate chaotic mornings.
3. **Work/Daytime (1:00–2:00)**
   * Office, meetings, or errands portrayed through humorous sound effects.
   * Example: typing → “tap tap tap,” emails → “ding ding,” printer → “rattle rattle.”
4. **Afternoon/Unexpected Moments (2:00–3:00)**
   * Funny events or mishaps: dropping something → “crash,” unexpected encounters → “gulp” or “awkward silence sound.”
   * Emphasize humor and relatability.
5. **Evening/Wind Down (3:00–3:30)**
   * Relaxing sounds: chair squeak, microwave beep, soft sigh, TV remote click.
   * End with playful “the end” sound effect or your own creative signature sound.
6. **Outro/Engagement Hook (3:30–4:00)**
   * Overlay text: “Can you guess my day?” or “What would your sound effect day look like?”
   * Encourage Reddit engagement in the comments.



# Technical Execution

* **Camera**: First-person POV or simple vlogging angle.
* **Sound Effects Sources**: Free online sound libraries, phone apps, or Foley effects.
* **Editing**: Quick cuts, synced sound effects, occasional exaggerated visuals for comedy.
* **Style**: Fast-paced, humorous, relatable, visually minimal to let sounds shine.",1,1762652572.0,ViralContentIdeaFarm,0,1.0,False

1os6ng9,https://youtu.be/O6HbV3N4vZo,4 Very Scary TRUE Backyard Woods Hide-and-Seek Horror Stories,"# ""Spence Field"":

I was nine years old that summer, and my little brother Dennis was almost seven. Every Father’s Day weekend, our family had this tradition of heading up to the Great Smoky Mountains for a camping trip. It was always the same group—Dad, Grandpa, Dennis, and me—packing up the old station wagon in Knoxville before sunrise and driving into the hazy blue ridges that felt like another world.

That year, another family joined us, friends of my parents with two boys around our ages. We hiked a long way up to a place called Spence Field, a wide meadow hemmed in by thick woods. The grass shimmered under the sun, and a light wind carried the scent of pine and earth. We set up our tents, cooked lunch over the camp stove, and spent the day exploring the trails that spidered off into the trees.

By midafternoon, the grown-ups were sitting near the trail talking, while Dennis and I started whispering with the other boys about playing hide-and-seek.

“Come on, let’s do it,” Dennis said, his eyes shining. He had on his red shirt and green pants—the outfit Mom insisted on for the trip so he’d be “easy to spot.”

“Yeah, let’s hide and jump out at the dads,” one of the other boys, Tim, whispered. His brother Alex grinned. “But don’t go too far, or we’ll get in trouble.”

We waited until the adults were distracted, then slipped off toward the edge of the clearing. Dad noticed us and called out, half-smiling, “You boys stay close!”

We giggled and ducked behind the trees. Dennis tugged at my sleeve. “Doug, where should I hide?”

I pointed to a thick patch of brush a little downhill. “Over there. We’ll all hide and meet back here after.”

He nodded and ran off, his shoes crunching in the dry leaves. The others scattered too, while I crouched behind a tree trunk.

After a minute, Tim whispered, “Now!” and we all leapt up, sprinting toward the grown-ups, shouting at the top of our lungs. They jumped, laughed, and Dad ruffled my hair. “Good one, boys.”

Then I looked around. “Hey—where’s Dennis?”

Tim shrugged. “He was right over there.”

Alex pointed toward the bush. “Maybe he’s still hiding.”

Dad frowned a little and called out, “Dennis! Come on, buddy, game’s over!”

No answer.

We started laughing nervously, calling his name again. I pushed aside the branches of the bush where he’d hidden. Empty. “He must’ve gone deeper in,” I said, my stomach tightening.

“Dennis!” Grandpa’s voice echoed through the trees. “This isn’t funny!”

We spread out, checking behind logs and rocks. Ten minutes passed. Then twenty.

Dad’s tone changed—sharper, strained. “Dennis!”

I ran ahead, shouting, my voice bouncing off the trees. The woods swallowed the sound. Everything felt suddenly still, as if even the birds were listening.

We hurried back to the tents, thinking maybe he’d looped around, but there was no sign of him. Mom wasn’t with us on that trip—just the guys—and I remember wishing harder than ever that she was.

Dad ran down the trail, checking the switchbacks while the rest of us waited. When he came back, he was out of breath, eyes wide. “Nothing,” he said quietly.

Grandpa put a hand on his shoulder. “We’d better call the rangers.”

By then, it had been about half an hour.

When the rangers arrived, they asked questions and took notes. One of them crouched to my level. “Tell me exactly what happened, son.”

I told him everything—the game, the hiding spots, the last place I saw Dennis. “He was wearing a red shirt,” I added, like that could make all the difference.

They nodded and started organizing search teams. “We’ll find him,” one said, but I could tell from the way Dad looked at the ground that he wasn’t so sure.

That night, flashlights moved through the woods like fireflies. I remember the sound of boots on the dirt, the static of radios, and the low murmur of men calling my brother’s name over and over. At one point, a ranger froze. “Did you hear that?” he whispered.

We all stopped.

Faint, far off—something like a cry.

“Could be an animal,” someone muttered, but it made my heart pound.

“Dennis!” I screamed into the dark, my voice cracking. No reply.

By morning, more searchers arrived—volunteers, soldiers, even helicopters sweeping the ridgelines. The forest that had felt so fun and open yesterday now seemed endless, heavy with mist and silence.

Dad kept asking me the same question: “Doug, did Dennis say anything before he hid? Anything at all?”

“No,” I said again. “Just where to hide.”

At one point, a ranger found small footprints leading toward a creek—one shoe print, one bare. My heart leapt. “That’s him!” I said.

But the prints vanished at the water’s edge.

That’s when I first saw the fear in my father’s eyes.

Later, a family hiking nearby reported hearing a scream around the same time Dennis disappeared. They told a ranger they’d seen a man moving quickly through the woods, carrying something—something wrapped in red cloth. The man was unshaven, dirty, his clothes torn.

“Red cloth?” Dad repeated, his voice trembling. Dennis’s shirt had been red.

That detail burned into me. Suddenly the forest felt alive, watching.

Dad began to believe someone had taken him. “Those footprints stopped at the creek,” he said that night, staring into the fire. “Whoever it was knew what he was doing.”

I lay awake, listening to the crackle of the fire and the wind brushing the tent walls. Every sound out there felt like footsteps. I kept thinking about Dennis’s laugh, the way he’d looked back over his shoulder before running to hide. I should’ve gone with him. I should’ve kept him close.

The days stretched into weeks. The rangers left, then the volunteers. Eventually, we went home without him.

For months, I’d look out the window every time a car slowed near our house, half-expecting to see him walking up the drive, smiling, dirt on his shoes, proud of how well he’d hidden. But he never came back.

Years later, they found bones somewhere deep in the Smokies. People said they might be his, but nothing was ever proven.

Dad never stopped searching in his own way—calling park offices, writing letters, driving up there once or twice a year. He’d stand at the edge of the meadow, staring at the tree line.

I still dream about that day sometimes—the red shirt vanishing into the green. The laughter fading. The woods holding their breath.

The Smokies took my brother. Or someone in them did.

And the worst part isn’t that we lost him. It’s that we never knew how.





# ""Petals and Shadows"":

That Mother’s Day morning began like so many others in our family—warm smiles after church, the faint smell of Mom’s perfume mixing with the scent of polished pews, and the promise of a picnic in the country. I was eleven then, old enough to button my own dress and help with my little sister, Marjorie. She was four, a bundle of freckles and red curls that never seemed to stay brushed for long. Dad used to call her “his little spark.” My brother Allan, seven, sat between us in the back seat, kicking his shoes against the seat, humming some tune from Sunday school.

“Settle down, Allan,” Mom said gently, turning to smile at us. She wore her cream hat with the little blue ribbon, the one she only took out for church. Dad was at the wheel, tapping the steering wheel to the rhythm of a hymn as the road wound through the forest near Bradford. Sunlight flickered through the trees, bright and alive, and the windows were cracked open just enough to let in the pine-scented air.

We met the Akerlinds at a clearing near the road—a quiet place Dad favored for picnics, with a stream running nearby and a patch of open grass dotted with wildflowers. Mr. Akerlind was already unpacking his fishing gear, while his wife helped Mom spread the checkered blanket. I remember the sound of laughter, the rustle of paper wrapping, and the smell of ham sandwiches mixed with the earth’s cool breath.

Marjorie tugged at my sleeve. “Dottie,” she chirped, “let’s pick flowers for Mama.” Her little hand felt small and warm in mine. I looked at Dad, who was talking with Mr. Akerlind about the trout in the stream, and then back at her eager face. “Okay, but not too far,” I said.

We skipped toward the tree line, our patent-leather shoes slipping a little on the damp grass. The woods were gentle there, open enough that sunlight poured through in long, golden ribbons. Violets carpeted the ground in spots, bright purple against the green. Marjorie laughed as she plucked them, her curls bouncing. “I’m gonna make the biggest bunch ever,” she declared.

The game started then—half pretend, half play. “Let’s play hide and seek with the trees!” she said. I closed my eyes, pressing my hands over them dramatically. “One, two, three…” She giggled, the sound like wind chimes. When I “found” her behind a rock, she squealed and ran to hug me. Mom’s voice floated from the blanket. “Don’t go too far, girls!”

Dad and Mr. Akerlind headed off to the stream with their poles. “Watch for snakes,” Dad called over his shoulder. Mom leaned back against the car, shading her eyes. “I’ll rest a bit. The sun’s making me drowsy.” Allan stayed near the food, busy with a cookie. The day felt still, slow—one of those afternoons you think will last forever.

Marjorie darted behind a clump of bushes. “You can’t find me this time!” she said, her voice teasing. I counted to ten and then looked up. “Ready or not…” I found her easily, crouched and grinning. “You’re too easy,” I laughed. “Now it’s your turn to count.” She covered her eyes with her tiny hands. I slipped behind a rock, just a few steps away. When she “found” me, we both laughed until our sides hurt.

We’d gathered a pretty pile of violets by then. “Let’s take them to Mama,” I said. But Marjorie shook her head, smiling slyly. “You go. I’ll hide really good this time.” I hesitated. “Okay, but don’t move till I get back.” She nodded solemnly, curls bobbing.

I jogged up to the car. “Here,” I said, holding out the flowers. “From me and Marjorie.” Mom smiled, brushing them with her fingers. “They’re lovely, sweetheart. Where’s your sister?”  
“She’s hiding,” I replied. “I’ll go get her.”

When I returned to the spot, I called softly, “Marjorie? Game’s over.” No reply. I checked behind the rock—empty. Behind the bushes—nothing. The woods, once filled with chirping birds, suddenly seemed too quiet. “Marjorie!” I called again, louder this time. Still nothing.

Allan came running when he heard me. “What’s wrong?”  
“I can’t find her,” I said, trying to sound calm. We searched together, parting bushes, checking behind trees. The stillness made my skin prickle.

When Dad and Mr. Akerlind returned from the stream, their laughter died when they saw my face. “She was just here,” I told them, breath quick. Dad’s expression hardened. “Spread out,” he ordered. “Call her name.”

Mom’s voice cracked as she shouted, “Marjorie! Come to Mama!” Mrs. Akerlind hurried toward the road, calling too. The forest echoed with her name, bouncing off the trees. Then someone found her little bouquet of violets, crushed near the rock. The stems were broken. I felt something cold settle in my stomach.

Dad drove into Kane to alert the police. I remember the station’s smell—coffee, ink, and cigarette smoke. “Little girl, red hair, freckles, red hat,” Dad told the officer. “She couldn’t have gone far.” The officer nodded. “We’ll find her. Don’t worry.”

By evening, the forest blazed with lanterns. Men from nearby towns came, boots crunching, voices calling into the dark. “Marjorie! Marjorie West!” Women brought food, and I sat beside Mom, watching her twist her hands in her lap. Rain began to fall, soft and cold. The searchers pressed on until midnight.

At dawn, they came back with bloodhounds. The dogs sniffed her dress, then bounded uphill toward an old cabin. Inside, nothing—just dust and silence. The trail ended at the road. A man mentioned a dark Plymouth seen speeding away that afternoon. The thought of it made my heart thud painfully.

Days passed, then weeks. The woods were combed over and over. Wells checked, streams dragged, fields turned upside down. Flyers went up everywhere: *Missing – Marjorie West, age 4.* The picture showed her smiling, the curls bright as copper.

But she never came back.

The FBI came, asked questions, took notes. Rumors spread—some said she’d fallen into a well, others whispered about bears or strange men on the road. Dad barely slept, roaming the woods with a lantern night after night. Mom sat by the phone, waiting for a call that never came.

Years blurred together. The posters yellowed. The volunteers stopped coming. We moved houses, but not far. “Just in case she finds her way home,” Mom said once, voice trembling. Allan stopped talking about her. I tried to grow up, but a part of me stayed in those woods, counting to ten.

I married, had children of my own, but I never stopped wondering. Did someone take her? Or did she simply wander too far, chasing a butterfly into the trees?

Sometimes, when I visit that forest, I swear I can still hear her laugh—soft, quick, fading between the pines. The scariest part isn’t what might have happened. It’s what we’ll never know.

Because somewhere, out there, the woods still keep their secret. And I still listen for her voice in the wind.





# ""Twenty Counts"":

It was October of 2006, one of those crisp Oregon mornings where the air smells of pine and cold stone. My son Alex and I had driven out to Crater Lake National Park for a weekend together—just the two of us. He was eight, small for his age, all restless energy and curiosity. He’d been obsessed with rocks and minerals lately, collecting them like treasures and labeling them in old mason jars at home. I thought the trip would do him good—let him run free, explore, maybe calm that intensity that sometimes came with his autism.

We stopped at a pullout near Cleetwood Cove, a quiet overlook where the volcanic soil rose sharply into a tangle of pines. The lake shimmered far below, a deep, impossible blue. The wind carried that sharp scent of wet bark and distant snow.

“Dad, look! Yellow rocks!” Alex shouted, pointing up the slope. He started climbing before I could say a word, his red sneakers flashing against the dark earth.

I laughed under my breath. “Hey—slow down, buddy. We’ve got all day.”

He turned, grinning, freckles bright against his pale skin. “Can we play hide-and-seek? Just one game!”

I hesitated. It was late afternoon, and the sun was already beginning to dip toward the treeline. But he was so eager—eyes wide, body vibrating with excitement. “Alright,” I said finally. “You hide. I’ll count.”

He gave a little cheer and darted uphill, small stones scattering behind him. I leaned against the car and started counting, voice echoing into the trees. “One… two… three…” I could hear him laughing, branches snapping as he climbed higher. By the time I reached twenty, the sound had faded.

“Ready or not, here I come!”

The woods were still, except for the wind. I started slow, checking behind the boulders and fallen logs at the base of the slope. “Alex?” I called out. No answer. I grinned a little, thinking he was trying to outsmart me. He was good at that. “You picked a good spot, huh? Well, I’ll find you.”

I climbed higher, boots slipping in the loose cinder. The trees thickened, their roots twisting like ropes across the ground. “This is fun, but we’ve got to go soon!” I shouted. Still nothing.

By the time I reached the crest, my grin had faded. I scanned the clearing ahead—a few scattered pines, some rocky outcrops. The air was quiet, too quiet. I called again, louder this time. “Alex! Game’s done!”

Only the echo answered back.

I began searching in earnest, weaving through brush, peering under logs, behind stumps. “Buddy, come on. You win. Let’s go.”

Five minutes passed. Ten. My heart began to hammer. He’d hidden before, refusing to come out until he decided the game was over. But this—this felt different. The woods stretched endlessly in every direction, and the slope dropped steeply toward the lake. I called again, voice cracking. “Alex! Answer me right now!”

Nothing.

I jogged back down toward the car, lungs burning, scanning the treeline. The car door was still locked, no sign he’d returned. I fumbled for my phone—barely a bar of signal. I tried calling anyway, pacing. “Come on, come on…”

Finally, the call connected long enough for me to reach park dispatch. “My son’s missing,” I said, my voice shaking. “We were playing hide-and-seek. He ran up the hill and didn’t come back down.”

Within an hour, two rangers arrived—calm, professional, trying not to show the urgency I could already feel rising like a tide. “How long has he been missing?” one asked.

“Forty minutes,” I said. “He’s wearing a blue coat, cargo pants, red shoes.”

They nodded and started scanning the slope, radios crackling. Soon, more arrived—volunteers, search dogs, flashlights cutting through the trees as the sun bled out behind the mountains.

We followed his tracks, small prints pressed into the volcanic soil, leading upward. Then, abruptly, they stopped where the ground turned rocky. “He went this way,” one ranger said, shining a light ahead. The beam disappeared into the dark.

I called his name again and again until my throat went raw.

Night fell hard. The temperature dropped fast, the forest turning cold and unfamiliar. Helicopters circled overhead, their spotlights sweeping the ridges. I remember sitting on a rock for a moment, breath fogging, whispering to no one: “He wouldn’t go far. He knows better.”

But deep down, I wasn’t sure anymore.

The next morning brought hundreds of searchers—rangers, deputies, volunteers with dogs and heat sensors. “We’ll grid the area,” the lead ranger said, spreading out a map. I stood beside him, nodding numbly. I barely slept. I just wanted to *move*.

We scoured miles of terrain—up slopes, down gullies, through dense pine and over fields of jagged rock. People called his name from every direction, voices echoing across the park. “Alex! It’s Dad! Come on out!”

Nothing.

A dog picked up a faint scent trail that curved toward the west, near a drainage leading toward the lake—but it vanished where the rocks began. “Could mean he changed direction,” the handler said quietly.

Rain started that afternoon, washing away what few tracks we had left.

My ex-wife arrived later that day. She looked at me like I was someone she didn’t recognize. “How could he just disappear?” she whispered.

“I don’t know,” I said. “We were playing.”

Rumors began swirling among the searchers—a hiker who’d seen a lone man wandering the road earlier, a parked vehicle nobody recognized. Someone mentioned cougar tracks nearby. Each theory hit like a blow to the chest. I imagined him hurt somewhere, or… something worse.

Days passed. Reporters showed up, asking questions I couldn’t answer. “Tell us about your son,” one said, thrusting a microphone forward. I stared past her, toward the ridgeline. “He’s smart,” I said softly. “He loves hiding. Please… if anyone knows anything…”

By the fifth day, snow began to fall—thin flakes drifting down through the trees. “We’ll have to suspend ground search at night,” a ranger told me. “It’s getting dangerous.”

I begged them to keep going. “He’s out there. I can feel it.”

But by the end of the week, the official search wound down. Volunteers went home. The rangers packed up their gear.

I stayed.

For weeks, I walked those same trails alone, calling his name into the wind. I returned year after year, checking the same ridges, the same gullies. Nothing ever turned up—not his jacket, not his shoes, not a scrap of clothing.

Some nights, even now, I dream I hear his voice—faint, from far away. I wake up and listen to the quiet, half expecting to hear him laugh, to see him step out from behind a tree, saying he’d won the game.

But the forest keeps its secrets.

And somewhere in those vast, silent woods above Crater Lake, my son is still hiding—waiting for me to find him.





# ""Count to Fifty"":

Emily, Jack, Lisa, and Tom all lived on the same street. Every afternoon after school, we’d be out there until dark—climbing the old oak, building forts from fallen logs, daring each other to explore the far edge of the woods where the light dimmed early and the air always felt a little colder.

One Saturday, Jack got that mischievous glint in his eyes and said, “Let’s play hide-and-seek out here. The woods are huge—no one’ll get found for hours.” We all laughed, thinking it sounded like an adventure. I offered to be “it” first.

Lisa grinned. “Close your eyes and count to fifty. No peeking.”

I leaned against the rough bark of a big oak, covering my eyes with both hands. “One... two... three...” Their laughter and footsteps crunched over dry leaves, fading into the distance. By the time I reached fifty, everything had gone still except for the rustle of wind through the branches.

“Ready or not, here I come!”

I started slowly, scanning the patches of sunlight breaking through the canopy. The forest smelled of earth and pine sap, and the quiet pressed in thick around me. I checked behind fallen logs and low bushes until I spotted Tom behind a pile of rocks, shoulders shaking as he tried not to laugh.

“Got you!”

He groaned and joined me, brushing off his jeans. “Let’s find the others. Emily always hides up high—probably in a tree somewhere.”

We searched together, calling out now and then. I caught a flash of Lisa’s pink sweater behind a trunk, and she squealed as we tagged her. “You two are too good,” she said, half annoyed but smiling.

Jack, though, was nowhere. We wandered farther, down where the ground sloped toward a creek, the air damp and cooler. The laughter was gone now. Only the distant trickle of water and the caw of a crow somewhere overhead.

“Jack!” I shouted. My voice echoed faintly through the trees.

That’s when I saw it—a patch of soil darker than the rest, mounded unevenly as if someone had been digging recently. “What’s that?” I asked, pointing.

Lisa frowned. “Probably an animal burrow.”

But when we got closer, a sour, heavy smell hit us. Rot, thick and unmistakable. Tom bent down and nudged the dirt with a stick. “This looks weird,” he muttered. As he stirred the soil, something pale broke through—smooth and still.

At first, I thought it was a root. But then I saw the shape. Fingers.

Lisa’s gasp cut through the silence. “Is that... a hand?”

Tom stumbled back, face pale. “We need to go. Now.”

But I couldn’t move. My brain wouldn’t catch up with what my eyes saw—the stiff curve of fingers, the dull, gray skin. The air around us felt heavy, suffocating. I whispered, “Who could that be?”

We’d heard the stories—people gone missing from nearby towns—but they’d always felt distant, like ghost tales told to scare kids. Now it was real.

Lisa grabbed my arm. “Alex, come on.”

Then—*crack.* A branch snapped somewhere behind us. Loud. Intentional.

Tom froze. “Did you hear that?”

Another snap, closer. Heavy footsteps on dry leaves. Not the quick scurry of an animal, but deliberate—like boots.

“Someone’s coming,” Lisa whispered.

We started backing away from the mound, our hearts pounding in sync. Through the trees, a figure emerged—a man, tall and broad, his face hidden by shadow. He was walking straight toward us.

“Run,” I hissed.

We bolted. Branches whipped our arms and faces, the forest suddenly alive with noise—our panicked breaths, the pounding of feet, the man’s heavy steps chasing after us.

“Hey! Stop!” he shouted, his voice rough, angry, close.

We didn’t dare look back. Tom tripped, yelping as his knee hit a rock, but Lisa and I grabbed him, dragging him up. “Keep going!”

“Stop, kids!” the man yelled again, closer now. My lungs burned, but the sight of sunlight ahead—the edge of the woods—gave me just enough strength to push harder.

We burst out into Emily’s backyard, stumbling into the open. She stood up from where she’d been hiding behind a shed, eyes wide. “What happened?”

“There’s a body!” Tom gasped. “And someone’s chasing us!”

We sprinted the last stretch to my house, slamming the door shut and locking it. My mom turned from the kitchen, dropping a plate when she saw our faces.

“What on earth—?”

We all talked over each other—about the smell, the hand, the man in the woods. Her hands trembled as she grabbed the phone. “Yes, officer, my son and his friends found something—something terrible,” she said.

Sirens came fast. Blue lights flashing against the trees, voices on radios, officers moving carefully down the trail as I led them back. I pointed to the mound of dirt. They dug, slowly, and uncovered what we already feared—a human body, wrapped in sheets, buried shallow.

It was someone missing from a nearby town. And the man who’d chased us—he was caught later that afternoon, hiding not far from where we’d found the grave. He confessed.

The police told us we’d done the right thing. But that night, I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the house made me sit up and check the window, half-expecting to see a shadow watching from the tree line.

Sometimes, even years later, I still think about it—that while we played games in the woods, laughing and hiding, he might have been out there too. Watching. Waiting.",1,1762652357.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1os6kl4,https://i.redd.it/augf5b5kw40g1.jpeg,Short Narrative: The Trip to Greece,"Darren and Heather had been dating for almost a month. He was handsome, blue-eyed, the kind of man who wore honesty like a second skin. She was a beautiful brunette with piercing green eyes — guarded, composed, and far too experienced with disappointment. Once, Heather had been openhearted, letting her feelings flow freely. But too many had  played games, leaving her walls tall and unshakable.

Darren wasn’t like them — she knew that. Or at least, she wanted to believe it. But believing required trust, and trust was something she had buried long ago.

On a warm Saturday afternoon, Darren decided to surprise her. He showed up at her door holding two plane tickets — a two-week vacation in Greece, set for a month from now. He wanted to make her smile, to show that he saw a future with her.

But surprises were dangerous territory with Heather. Her eyes widened — not in joy, but in disbelief. “You booked this without even asking me?” she snapped.

He blinked, taken aback. “I thought it would make you happy.”

She folded her arms. “You thought wrong.”

Deep down, Heather knew she could take the time off work. She had earned more than enough vacation days. The real reason she was upset wasn’t about logistics — it was fear. Fear of losing control, of letting someone else take the wheel of her life. She told Darren to leave, saying she needed space.

He left quietly, confused and hurt. Not because she asked him to go, but because she didn’t even try to understand him. Every time he reached out, her walls grew taller.

That weekend, Heather met her mother for lunch, as she always did. Over coffee, her mother asked, “So, how are things with Darren?”

Heather hesitated. “Fine.”

Her mother smiled knowingly. “That’s not an answer. What happened?”

Heather sighed. “He surprised me with a trip to Greece. Two weeks. Next month.”

“And that’s why you’re angry?”

“Yes. He should’ve talked to me first.”

Her mother tilted her head. “Does it conflict with work?”

“No.”

“Then what’s the problem, sweetheart?”

Heather looked down. “Men usually hide something when they do big gestures like this.”

Her mother leaned forward. “Do you believe Darren is hiding something?”

A long pause. Then Heather whispered, “No.”

Her mother smiled softly. “Then maybe, darling, the only thing you’re hiding… is your heart.”

Heather laughed quietly, almost embarrassed. “Maybe I’m just being difficult.”

“Maybe,” her mother said, “but difficult doesn’t always mean wrong. It just means you’re scared. The question is — of what?”

The next morning, Heather drove to Darren’s house. When he opened the door, she looked nervous but determined. They sat in silence on the couch for a long moment.

Finally, she said, “I’m sorry for getting upset. I’ll see if I can take the time off for the trip. Just tell me the dates.”

Darren looked at her for a long moment. Then quietly, he said, “Heather, I’ve been open with you from the start. When are you going to open up to me?”

She shook her head slowly. “I can’t. I’m sorry.”

He stood and walked toward his bedroom, leaving her alone in the living room.

She waited a minute, hoping he would return. When she heard his footsteps again, she stood and walked toward the front door.

“I’m leaving now,” she said softly.

As she reached for the handle, Darren’s voice broke the silence behind her.

“Heather!”

She stopped — frozen — but didn’t turn around.

“Let me in,” he said quietly, his voice thick with longing.

Still, she didn’t turn. The air between them hung heavy with everything unsaid.

Then, just as she began to open the door, his voice rose again — firmer this time.

“I love you!”

Heather paused, her hand still on the knob. Slowly, she turned halfway toward him, her eyes soft but unreadable.

“I’ll leave a window open,” she said.

Then she walked out, closing the door behind her — not as an ending, but as a fragile promise that love, like air, might still find its way in.

How can I approach this?,"We've been together for one year and my boyfriend has mentioned before that his conversations with my mom aren't really conversations at all, he just listens to her talk and go off on tangents, and he's right. He's also a big introvert and usually gets completely drained when he has to interact with people a lot.

It happens frequently that whenever he comes over, my mom will tell him anecdotes, recap her day, talk about movies she’s watched, and so on, and he listens attentively. I have to admit, I don't usually talk much with her myself. And when my boyfriend visits, I sometimes don't want to jump into the conversation either, so I often wander off and do other things. But that has led to her talking non-stop with him.

About a week ago, as soon as he arrived, she said she had somethimg to talk in private with him. He later told me she gave him a reading from the Bible because she felt he needed it. For context, my boyfriend is an atheist, and on my advice to avoid conflict, he didn't refute or question anything she said. That day, they started talking around 12 p.m. and didn't finish until 6 p.m. In the meantime, I made lunch, we ate around four, and then they just kept going. 

Yesterday, he came over around 4 p.m. after getting off work, and my mom immediately started talking to him. I participated on and off, but I was a bit distracted and doing other things, I also made them coffee and sandwiches. Before I realized it, it was 10 p.m., and he had to leave. I feel like he was rude to me when he left. He wouldn't let me hug him goodbye, and he didn't even want to look at me. It also really upset me that I didn't get to spend any time alone with him, we didn't even kiss all day. The last I knew, he got home safe yesterday. 

He hasn't responded to any of my messages so far today, and I suspect he turned off his phone after I called him. What can I do?",1,1762651990.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

1. Here's the thing: I’m about to work really hard for the next three years. As a first-generation American, I’ll be juggling three jobs. I know, I know... But I'm West Central African. After earning terminal degrees, many of us pursue this path for three years and then transition to a single job. It’s a common path for businesses to start in Africa and expand here.

\*I have no kids, no partner, no pets\*



2. Since I’ll be working like a mule, I’d love to have a nice view to enjoy after work. I’ll be relying on public transportation, so I'll need a neighborhood close to a train station. 



3. My budget is between $2000 and $2600 a month. I really want a place with a balcony and a view. 



4. Lifestyle-wise: I need to see water, please, I really need to see water. I enjoy visiting farmers' markets at early hours and love going to Whole Foods (even if it’s a little tough on my wallet) and Trader Joe’s. I drink coffee like an East African, so I appreciate any spots with coffee shops.

I'm familiar with the rain and gloomy days; I stayed in Northwest England. It gets dark quite early, around 4 pm, followed by rain. Then, the cold weather and vitamin D deficiency, beautiful England, lol.   
  
 I also spent some time in Alaska, so darkness doesn't bother me much. 

As a Third-Culture Kid turned Third-Culture Adult, I thrive in artsy, cosmopolitan environments, and I’d love to be surrounded by that energy.

  
I can't believe I have to say this part, moving back to the states after leaving for some years....oh mennn

I am Bantu, so I am not passing for anything but a West-Central African woman.  
  
I need an area where I wouldn't need to see cosplaying of Wartime Germany

Currently, with the American side of the family in Texas, I have seen things that are just breathtaking.

Like there is ten billion orders on the screen and two people packing ur food, one of them new. I'm solely working on doordash and curbside orders. Neway this guy was waiting like almost 30 mins, he did have a huge order with multiple happy meals+ other food and a coffee in the afternoon so now someone has to make a new batch for him. 

Anyway even though Im focusing on doordash and curbside I see a customer who I know has been waiting a while I ask to see his number he gets upset and tells me to check the time and legitimately just waits till I take my phone out and check the time.

 Then after he shows me his receipt and I apologize (at this point of me working at this job my ""im sorry"" has no emotion in them because of the amount of times I have to tell people that) he tells me what are you gonna do about it he says something among the lines of a refund, I immediately tell him okay and go get my manager, apparently one of the workers doing orders to go was finishing it. He still wants a refund the manager goes to help him. At this point I just go back to my orders. 

At the end of the day we didnt have enough people in the kitchen, orders were taking forever to get out, we were pretty slow, I understand if customers are frustrated with the wait, but just ask for a refund, dont try to be smart with me go on about your day there is multiple fucking restaurants within a minute drive of this shitty ass mcdonalds just get your money and leave.

1os6dbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteNerds/comments/1os6dbj/how_accurate_price_comparison_tools_are_reshaping/,How Accurate Price Comparison Tools are Reshaping Consumer Awareness,"There is a quiet revolution happening in the way people shop. It is not about flashy marketing or one day sales. Instead, it is happening on screens, in the careful, considered moments before a shopping cart is ever filled. Consumers are becoming wiser, more data driven, and frankly, more powerful. And a lot of this shift comes down to the rise of precise, transparent [price comparison](https://compare.nedostavka.net/en).

Think about the old way of doing things. A person might wonder if a product is cheaper elsewhere. They would have to physically visit different stores or juggle multiple browser tabs, trying to compare apples to apples, often literally. It was tedious and the information was often a best guess. This is where a new generation of tools is changing the game. Services like NedosTavka are moving beyond abstract estimates, offering a side by side look at identical products across different countries and stores. This is not about comparing the category of pasta in Poland to the category in Germany. It is about comparing that exact box of Barilla Fusilli, with the same barcode, sitting on shelves hundreds of miles apart.

This level of specificity in price comparison is a complete game changer for consumer awareness. When someone can see, with their own eyes, that the same jar of coffee or brand of butter costs significantly less in one place than another, it does more than just save them a few coins. It fundamentally alters their relationship with retailers. It shatters the illusion of uniform pricing and makes regional strategies completely transparent. This knowledge is power. It turns a casual shopper into an informed consumer.

This newfound awareness also stretches across borders. For expats, travelers, or anyone curious about the cost of living elsewhere, this tool provides a genuine look into supermarket aisles around the world. They are not relying on outdated or averaged data. They are seeing the real, current price for the exact products they know and buy. This kind of cross border price comparison demystifies the global market on a personal level. It answers the question, ""Could I afford my same lifestyle there?"" with concrete data.

Furthermore, this transparency creates a healthy pressure on retailers. In a world where consumers can pull out their phone and instantly validate a price against a dozen competitors, the incentive to offer fair and competitive pricing becomes much stronger. It encourages honesty and can even influence how stores stock their shelves and plan their promotions. An accurate price comparison tool does not just serve the buyer. It subtly raises the bar for the entire retail ecosystem.

Of course, no system is perfect. These services are in active development, and sometimes a product might be out of stock or a price might be updating. But the direction is clear. The demand for this kind of precise information is only growing. People are tired of guessing. They want to know. And as these tools continue to evolve, getting smarter and more comprehensive, the modern shopper will only become more savvy. The act of price comparison is no longer a chore. It is the first, smart step in taking control of your budget and spending with confidence. It is how the simple act of checking a price tag is reshaping the entire landscape of consumer awareness.",1,1762651540.0,WriteNerds,0,1.0,False

Moved all the furniture, buried the plants that need to be overwintered, cover what need to be covered with tarps, etc. I very much did not enjoy the experience but I am glad to have done it solely because now it is done and I don't have to go back out there. It is supposed to snow tomorrow so all of this had to be done today.

It was nice to have a break from writing. I'm sure you can tell I have been struggling with it recently. I know what needs to be writing and I want it written but the drive to actually do the writing has been dancing around me day by day. I always catch it eventually but the chase is taking longer and longer. Perhaps letting it get away from me for a day will do me some good. Besides, even if I wanted to write today, by hands were in no shape for it after a few hours in the garden. I may writing a little tonight after my coffee mugs warms me the rest of the way up, but I wouldn't hold your breath about it.

Yours & Mine,

I'm hoping I'm right because it tastes SO GOOD as someone who loves coffee / on the sweet side. I can't have dairy so no vanilla sweet cream for me unfortunately.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1762650843.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.67,False

I’m a 31-year-old international medical graduate currently studying for the US board exams (USMLE). Most of my days are spent buried in books and coffee, so I thought it’d be nice to meet someone genuine to talk to — maybe share some good conversations, chill vibes, or even study breaks.

I’m hoping to find someone friendly and open-minded, preferably around Snohomish County, so we could maybe hang out in person sometime. But I’m also cool with online chats if you’re a bit farther away.

If you’re someone who enjoys meaningful convos, random jokes, or just having someone to talk to, feel free to DM me or drop a comment😊",1,1762650615.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
