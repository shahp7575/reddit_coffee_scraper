Well I have very very good news!! Before I start before you slam on my mother PLEASE look at all of my posts about this BEFORE you make a judgment. I understand you're trying to help but a lot of your posts were upsetting to me.

 This is just a small snippet of my life and a mistake that was made years ago that can't be changed. My mom has gotten better over the years and has been my rock through very tough times. 

 That being said, here is the final update. We woke up pretty early this morning around 7:30 am. And got ready. As far as we knew he was going to be ar breakfast. 
   
 So, I told her I'd rather go to Starbucks for my breakfast instead. She said ok that is fine. So we went our seprate ways. My mom, aunt N. Cousin M, and Uncle V2 went to meet with the others. 

 (This was MY choice to have breakfast by myself. Please don't slam my mom for not going with me. I wanted her to be with her family as it meant more to me to spend as much time as possible. As they're up in age and we don't know hoe long any of us have. We dont know what tomorrow holds.)

 Anyways, I went to Starbucks ordered my coffee. They didn't have much food wise, so I just got a large coffee.

 Then as I was waiting my mom texted me. ""Hey he isn't coming why don't you come over and have breakfast with us."" I was like sure, lemme get my coffee and I'll meet you there.

 I got my coffee and headed to the restaurant. When I got there all eho was there was my mom, aunt N, uncle V, uncle V2 and cousin M.

 Aunt C stayed home as she wasn't feeling well (which didn't bother me at all. It made it better that she wasn't there)

 I sat down and were talking and having a good time! It was nice seeing everyone getting alone and being happy and laughing. Acting like siblings should!

 The food was good. And we talked (well they did me and my cousin M just listened lol we don't talk much.)

 Then once we finished we took some family pictures of everyone together and said our goodbyes went our seprate ways. Mom and I went to Walmart to shop for the nieces Easter and birthday gifts and headed home. 

 We just got home about an hour ago and I smothered my 3 kitties in hugs and kisses I missed them so much! I'm glad to be home and glad God is so good and that our family bonds are in the process of healing! Praise God!

 Thank you all for reading my story and those who had helpful advice. I want to state no one is perfect. And people screw up especially parents and family. 

 Even tho I wasn't able to face my fear, I might be able down the road with some heavy therapy once we can afford it. 

 What happened this weekend/week reminds me of Disney's Brave. The line; ""Fate be changed. Look inside. Mend the bond torn by pride."" Which has a lot of truth in it! 

 And my mom and her siblings are living proof of that. There was pride and anger and hatred that had shattered them for over 30 years. And now they've put aside their pride and are now on the road to healing.

 I'm glad to have been there to see most of it. Anyways in rambling. Thanks for reading!

TLDR: Mom and her siblings went to breakfast turns out the cousin this post has been about didn't come. I went to breakfast and saw thay they were acting like a family again!

 Had some fun stories from their past, family pictures and we parted ways and went home. So far a happy ending!",0,1744754544.0,AITAH,0,0.5,False

1k04bpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1k04bpo/developed_a_morning_routine_and_im_very_proud_of/,Developed a morning routine and I'm very proud of myself,"So for about 3 weeks now (which I know doesn't seem long but it's probably the longest I've ever gone lol) I decided to really commit to getting my shit together. I have bad ADHD so a lot of the common advice isn‚Äôt helpful in and of itself, but I‚Äôve been taking bits and pieces and modifying it to work better for me. I'm not fully where I want to be yet and also haven't really developed a great night routine yet, but here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been working for the morning so far:

* Waking up at the same time everyday: This has always been impossible for me but I‚Äôve found a method that's so far been working. Just like a lot of people my 2 biggest problems are staying up way too late and pressing snooze over and over again in the morning. For the first part, instead of just saying ""I'm gonna start going to bed at X time"" I've been going to bed 15 minutes earlier every 2 nights, and also telling myself I need to go to bed a half hour earlier, so basically breaking it down to increments and combatting ""time blindness"" or whatever it's called. The day I decided to do this I had gone to bed at 1:30 am the night before so I based it off that starting time. For the morning, I both put my phone away from my bed *and* got a physical alarm clock which isn't near my bed or where I keep my phone, and I set alarms on both. Just moving my phone hadn't worked for me before because I'd go turn the alarm off and go back to bed (or fully sleep through it) but having 2 different blaring noises that I have to go 2 different places to turn off wakes me up and keeps me out of bed long enough to stop me from going back. I also set multiple alarms on my phone just in case but so far haven't had to use more than the first 2. Also keeping my phone away from my bed has stopped me from going back on my phone after I get in bed to go to sleep.
* After I wake up I immediately go to the bathroom and leave my phone in my room so I don't start scrolling in there. Wash my face, brush my teeth, take my meds in that specific order because for some reason doing it exactly the same way everyday helps, don't know why but it does.
* Get my phone from my room, go to kitchen and make coffee and breakfast. Since I'm doing something with my hands and that I know will give me gratification after, I don't have the urge to go on my phone but having it with me is important for the next step. If I'm making something that uses pans I wash them before I start eating while the coffee is brewing. Eat in the kitchen not my room, leave my phone on the counter while I eat, don't drag out eating, and wash dishes immediately after I finish so it doesn't feel like I'm switching tasks.
* After this I let myself go on my phone for the first time of the day (this is the reason I bring it to the kitchen with me so I don't have to go back to my room and have the thing happen where when you change the environment it feels like you're resetting time) and I have developed a routine for how I do that too. First thing I do is the mini crossword from the elevate app lmao, it takes like 5 minutes and there's only one per day so can't get fixated, but it gives me a little dopamine hit. That might not be for everyone but I like it personally. Then I let myself have 15 minutes on youtube and 15 minutes on reddit, I control this with the screenzen app which is sort of like the screentime restriction that's built into iphones, but it only gives you a certain amount of unlocks everyday and disables unlocking for a certain amount of time after your allotted time on the app ends, so you can't just keep pressing remind me later. So about 25 mins on my phone in total which is enough to feel satisfying.
* If I'm working early shift, 10-20 mins walking my dog depending how much time I have left, and leave. If I'm off or working afternoon shift, exercise for about an hour- walk my dog (or jog with her if I'm really feeling it that day) 25-40 mins. I live right near a hiking trail so I do that a lot of the time but just walking outside wherever works, gets me moving and outdoors so I get that gratification. Also obviously you don't need a dog to do this but it is a motivator for me because not walking her isn't an option, but specifically making it a part of my routine has helped so still want to mention it. 5 or 6 days a week I do 30 mins of strength training after that. I know that's not for everyone but if you're interested I've found follow along videos on youtube that have a timer in the corner that counts down to the end of the exercise helps me feel more motivated to do it.
* Shower because I feel sweaty and gross after working out so that's enough motivation alone for me to do it (on days I'm working early I shower when I get home)

And that's basically where the routine I've developed ends so far, still trying to develop a system for getting chores done and stuff, especially on days I work when I get home and have no energy. I have found that having a structured morning routine does help with motivation to get more done later in the day, but not to the extent I'd like so I do want to develop a routine for that as well. Overall though I'm proud of myself and feel like I've taken a gigantic step in my discipline compared to where I started.

1k04asj,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1k04asj/does_this_sound_like_bipolar_2/,Does this sound like Bipolar 2?,"My therapist is entertaining the idea that I'm bipolar 2. I'm currently pregnant with my 3rd baby. So nothing can be don't until I'm postpartum. Would be I guess too dangerous to medicate me even if I am. Here's a entire timeline up until the age I am now at 28:

So, here is literally the history of my life. How I got to be where I am today and who I am I believe.

I'm an only child. My mom was supposed to have another after me. But she was not mentally ready at the time and aborted them. I don't hold that against her, I feel so bad she feels guilty to this day did she make a mistake. I'm sure their chilling up in heaven if that exists who knows.

My parents are very broken but sweet people. My father is a recovering alcoholic, he hasn't drank in years and years. But if he gets in the bottle it can be bad. I grew up home schooled at first. My mom was very abusive verbally towards me. I don't remember much but very broken memories of being afraid of her and not wanting to do wrong. I think I remember her getting mad I ""cheated"" at telling time idk.

I inherited that rage from her. I've in the past yelled at atticus. Once I got so mad I was screaming at him and got all in his face. I think I got almost physical like where I grabbed him. He cowered and was crying. I broke at that point. snapped out of him and cried and cried with him. I felt so bad. I almost wanted to call CPS on myself but I knew it wasn't me. It was the rage and I got help. I think I did anxiety meds for a bit temporarily. Which helped alot. and helped me channel my rage. 

I do alot better now and rarely get like that. If I do, I take a step back usually. or I do get loud and then I apologize to my kids and explain we all lose our tempers sometimes. it doesn't mean I don't love you. and to please call me out on it. 

So, I think the early verbal abuse really stunted me. I got my medical records from my pediatrican as a kid. The comments were always ""she's so quiet"" I was always quiet.

I was hyer sexual towards females only as a kid. I would experiment and rub on them or do like ""doctor'"" stuff with all my girlfriends mostly I had sleepovers with. I remember 3 girls in total. 1 girl we stayed ""best friends"" our whole childhood this weird sexualness happened at all our sleep overs until by closer to our teen years she voiced she didn't like it and it was wrong. Our relationship was never the same after that. It was weird with her especially I felt even then that I liked being in control of that. 

I do not have any memories of any sexual abuse. The only thing that qualifies kinda of. Is my pop (my dad's dad) when i was little maybe 8-11? idk. We were outside on their front porch. I remember he was sitting in a chair and he was barefoot. he looked at me and asked me to wash his feet. I immediately felt scared and in danger. My whole body felt like it was on fire. I was so afraid I guess I said no. That was that. I can't remember if i ever told my parents i think i waited a long time to say. There's rumours he sexually abused his own daugther and maybe his other granddaugther. I don't know if this is true. but it was said he would comment on his short his daugther's skirts were and make her sit on his lap. He would spank his own wife in front of his kids. He beat my dad all the time for dissobeying or just because. Once my dad begged his mom to go stay with his aunt she refused and that day he had got a huge bruise. she turned an eye to the abuse. it only stopped because my dad grew into a teenager and threatened to kill his dad if he ever lay a hand on him again. he never did again.

I wet the bed off and on until high school. I tried the alarm thing didn't work, tried meds, etc. my pediatrican sucked and gave up figuring it out said maybe surgery or i could just grow out of it. It messed me up so bad. I had no self confidence. I remember my parents getting irritated over the years because i was still wearing pull ups at such an older age. 

I stopped having sleepovers except with that girl i had sexual relations with. And we became distance enough the only time wed have sleepovers was on her bday and mine. so we saw each other 2 times a year usually. 

By the 5th grade or so. I remember one day a switch went off. I lost the desire to socialize with others. i become very isolated. i did have 2 friends at the private school i went to and we did have a third friend. she was different though and back then i relentlesslly made fun of her. it was awful. i finally let that school and stopped bullying her. to this day it haunts me.  she could have killed herself due to that. i hope she grew from that and realized i was just a sick broken kid. I made fun others too i was a mean girl. by high school sophmore year i become basically mute except to teachers. ate lunch in the bathrooms. wouldnt wash my hair for days. wore the same outfit over and over. i fantizied some days if i just pulled a gun or took pills to take the pain out. I never really meant that I wanted to die i realize now I was just so broken. 

As a teenager and well a pre teen my parents let me have a computer in my room full access whenever i wanted it. no parental control on the internet. i was in chat rooms talking about sexual things to ""boys"" and by 16-17 met a ""guy"" off this social anxiety forumn who claimed he lived in the netherlands. fell ""in love"" i was sending him videos of me masturbating and naked pics. he really sent stuff sometimes a penis pic. i never saw his actual face on facetime just very old blurry ish pics. he claimed he was too shy. they did finally find out made me stop talking to him told me he was probbably fake and a pedophile. we were to the point he was trying to get me to travel to the netherlands to visit him. i almost looked into it. thank god they stopped that. I could have been human trafficked or killed. so we stopped talking. they monitered my internet usage for a while but gave it all back. i actually talked to him online years later never found out was he really who he said he was. idk. 

Also, as a teen for a very brief period we had this dog it was a lab. i had this random very odd desire to want to know what it was like to fuck that dog. i never touched the dog but would masturbate beside it. I stopped after a while. I felt so much shame never happened again. i was also into BDSM things. would read up on it as a teen. 

fast foward after high school. i graduated early to get away from school. i go to community college. meet my first boyfriend off okay cupid. i was beyond anxious from never having done anything-no prom, barely any friends, nor boyfriends, etc. our relationship was hell on earth. i picked fights with him. never got to know his family. refused to do anything but literally cry about doing anything. i enjoyed having sex with him at first but developed this severe fear after a while. that i was going to hell for having sex so we stopped doing it mostly bc i cried after everytime. id literally go to his house and wed try to watch anime and i had such bad panic attacks i just cried. i lived off of oreos and energy drinks at the time to stay skinny. 

He finally when he was about to graduate from the same community college i was going to broke up with me. his final straw was i went to an anime convention with him. refused to do anything left halfway in the day due to a severe panic attack. i remember him kissing me bye and felt the difference. a few days later he told me hung out with his classmate and she asked did he have a gf he said no. he swears they never had sex but he said it was over. he ended up marrrying her. their very adorable and happy now. i used to absoutely hate him for it and her. but currently im fb friends with him! we are friendly and have forgiven everything we did. its amazing actually

for years after though i kept thinking he was the one who got away. and i wouldn't ever stop wishing he would give me another chance. in 2017 i met my now husband off tinder. same relationship pattern. our first date was me riding in his car driving around listening to music. he did alot of the talking. i was dumb as hell he could have murdered me. 

by date 4 he took me to a bar with a friend of his. i acted like a total bitch. on the way home he was furious with me didn't understand why i acted the way i did. he didn't realize it was severe anxiety that came out in anger. he told me years later that he was ready to tell me to shove it up my ass and never speak to me again but he thought i was cute so he said he waited for me to apologize. he said maybe an hour later i texted this long explaination explianing i suffer from extreme anxiety and some depression. he gave me a chance and worked on healing me. he took me to the mountains for our first trip. i spent most of that time crying in his arms pouring my soul out to him how much i wanted to change but it was so hard. 

he stuck to his word as long as he saw i was trying he never left me. He got me out of my shell completely. he is truly my savior. im not exactly religious anymore but he truly is like some god that took pity on me. or maybe god placed him in my life to heal me. idk. 

it wasn't perfect we fought so much. I still had baggage from the trauma from my ex. the weekend he proposed (which was beautiful) in the hotel room i got super drunk for the first time and cried saying i still hated my ex's new gf and fuck them. I said who knows what else. he still married me.

once we were married i fell off the deep end again. I was struggling at the time and had started a new job doing credentialing for a dental office. It was a difficult job because they were family owned and had a legit office manager doing it before me. someone who didn't have the time to do it. so there were insurance claims years back that hadn't been paid it was a hot ass mess. I finally had a nervous breakdown and quit on the spot. just walked out left work. told my boss over email i had a nervous breakdown and couldn't return. made my husband return my keys and other property. i couldn't face them. it was a good paying job one of the best jobs ive had looking back. 

once i quit i spiraled. I had heard women would go online and go on dates with sugar daddies and supposedly not sleep with them. i signed up for a website and would make money sometimes going on dates with old men. well i eventually told my husband who was very uncumfortable but didn't know what to do so he kind of ignored it. one time i drove for a few years almost drove to the beach to have sex with a guy. panicked and didnt. the rule was supposed to never any physical stuff. as long as it wasnt that my husband could deal with it. only once did i give a guy a blowjob and got paid for it in public in the woods. it was super quick i basically barely did and stopped. it took years for me to tell my husband about that. also, during that time the very last time i did the ""dating"" one man was rich. beautfil home i went to his house and he cooked this gourmet meal for me and we had a chat. he then tried to kiss me i refused and kept trying to get me to sleep with him. i eventually left never doing it. well i had parked my car in his driveway at some point he left to go to the store to get something he had forgotten ingrident wise. i guess he had too much wine and i didn't know it. he crashed into my car. i had to drive my car back to my husbands and of course admit what really happened. i lied to my parents said someone hit me in a parking lot. since i was under 25 i was on their insurance. i tried not telling them and handling it myself but of course the agent told my mom. they thought it was really suspiscius i think, but i never told them the truth. after that my husband said that it he wasn't comfortable.

we had a incident in the apartment we were in at the time. i got super drunk at our apartment, and blacked out. my boyfriend (husand now) told me i got butt naked, ran around started trashing everything. threw this dino cookie jar we had. when i woke up the next day i didn't remember anything. he said he almost had to call the cops it was so bad. 

fast forward a few months go by i get pregnant with out first baby. my husband was deployed for alot of the pregnancy. i spent that whole pregnancy eating my feelings, spending a ton of money, and being so depressed. my husband came back and i had wracked up thousands of dollars of debt. he was a saint. he was mad but we got through it started in therapy and got better over time. i was supposed to go back to work to an onlibe job i had at the time but the day or day before i was supposed to go back i panicked. my husband left to go the gym for a bit i was with our baby. we had leftover alcohol from some party we had gone to. i started drinking and got pretty buzzed. i called him or texted in tears saying i was drinking and he needed to come home now. i never did that again but told him i had a panic attack about leaving our baby. the plan was my mom was going to watch him at her house. i never looked back and have been a stay at home mom ever since. i also finally at some point around this time frame admitted to my husband i am bisexual. i have 0 desire to experiment with women, i love him only. i just needed to say it out loud to him. that if we ever did divorce id probably try women lol. 

postpartum was hard. it had alot of ups and down. i went through periods of lots of drinking. i would get plastered as possible. i eventually had to stop drinking cold turkey. i was scared i was going to become addicted and not be able to stop. i remember sometimes postpartum i used to pop pain pills randomly. i wasnt in pain i just liked to. that was dark but i stopped doing it after a while. started scaring me. 

Then we got pregnant wth our second. mentally i was good for a few months. my husband had to deploy again. but about 2-3 months before he came home. i started slipping into a depression. i stopped being able to care for my self or son. i recognized this somewhat and at the time i would pet sit and house sit for them. i would stay in their home all the time with their pets while they were away. i started taking on long gigs sometimes a full week and my son stayed with my parents while i did this. it was the best thing for him. it wasn't good i was not spending enough time with him. but i was mentally so unwell. i should have told a therapist and maybe been admitted if needed. i was scared CPS would be called and they'd take my son away from me forever. I also started hating my husband. i got it in my head he hated me. we almost divoced. once during a phone call he said ""kelly are we about to do this' he couldn't bring himself to say the word. i immediately cried and said no. he realized then i was just really sick. i was also not caring for our home. since i would house sit so much id leave our dogs for hours alone no potty breaks. we had a cat too. our house was covered in dog poop and pee. they tore our house up. by the time my husband came home from his deployment he said the smell almost took him out when he got close to the front door. he immediatenly was horrified. luckily by that point when i was home since it was so bad i stayed at my parents basically full time. used the excuse it was the pregnancy. wasted so much gas money every single day going back and forth to check on our own pets and then go back to there house. it was almost an hour of driving. during that time our ac totally went out and i refused to get it fixed. my parents mind you saw how bad our house was, offered to get it cleaned and help me figure out the ac. i refused. to this day i don't really understand why they didn't step in and call my husband. i needed help and was drowning in depression. but whatever. when my husband returned he got our ac fixed and got our house deep cleaned. we talked. i got better. i had my son, i was induced and the pitcon they gave me caused his heart rate to drop and him to almost stop breathing. he was also in a weird position. i tried pushing but it made him in more distress. they told us it was emergency c section. so i barely had time to even pray even though i dont believe in god. or anything i just thought damn this might be it just please save me and my baby. i woke up to barely having a voice but was told i was fine and so was baby. recovery was brutal for a few days i was hunch backed and my husband had to do everything for me. had to help me shower i could barely go to the bathroom by myself. but once i got home i recovered quickly. this postpartum i had made friends by this point and have a lovely memory postpartum. i was maybe a week or two out. still in diapers. but i got dressed in my favorite outfit and did my hair and makeup. arranged a coffee meetup and brought my boys. my mom friends loved the new baby and i felt so good. i felt so loved. this postpartum experience was so healing overall. i did have a period right after birth i always get so euphoric for a bit i thought it was a sign of mania. i panicked reached out to my OB they said keep an eye out and if it got worse or contiuned for long theyd worry. it went away and i started sleeping normally again.

by this point and beyond i kept getting bettter and better. im in such a better place now. now pregnant with my third baby i have had to worst physical experience but mentally im so much better. 

Recently though i did have a very traumatic medical experience. My OB put me on Compazine for nausea. I had taken 4 doses i think. It was a saturday at 1 am i took my next dose. I noticed from 1-4 am. i was wired, couldn;t shut my eyes, couldn't sleep, heart racing, etc. i was like okay a panic attack induced from the meds. noted dont take any more and let my ob know. well by 5 am i was scared. i woke up my husband and said something wrong. we called my ob's nurse advice line. sweetest lady told my husband to have me go outside in nature. mind you both our kids are sick. but our oldest always wakes up at 5 am. so my husband held the baby and we walked outside in our front yard barefoot. talked. i felt better. came inside and it all came back. by about 7 am my eyes were blurry, i couldn't see well, i was looking up at the ceiling or the side of our walls. my husband asks did he want me to call 911 or take me to the ER? I said call because i didn't want them to get anyone sick, see me like this for any longer, or to get sicker from being there.

the ambulance comes. i am taken in to the nearest hospital. when i get there i continue to not be able to barely see, eyelids fluttering if i close them, looking in weird places. craining my neck. they suspect im having a reaction to the med. they said my potassium is low and they think it had to do with that too. give me fluids. see what happens, im just getting worse. they then say to transfer to my OB because im pregnant and they don't have the resources to check on baby

i get transferred to my OB and that's where my hell begins truly. by this point ive started talking weird, yelling out, craining my neck to the side constantly, grimancing, they ask me questions. i cant say my kids names, their bdays, what day or year it is. i cry when this happens im so afraid. at one point my mouth and throat feel tight. i think thats it im going to pass out and stop breathing. while they too suspect its that med. they still call a code stroke. i get an EKG and their checking everything. im still having episodes every few mins off and on. they ask to i want to call anyone i say my husband they offer to facetime him i refuse to let him see me like that. he can tell on the phone im acting weird. but they explain its a reaction to the med. and that i didn't have a stroke or seizure their pretty sure. they finally verified i was good cleared by the neurologist. they administer benadryl and some other drug. within 20 minutes im back to normal. i get transferrred to one more hospital for monitoring overnight and go home the next day

when i get home i have some stiff neck issues but that's mostly resolved. but even since that day i sleep around 3-4 hours then i cant go back to sleep. i now realize its always around the time that episode started. i wonder if its my brains way of coping? leftover anxiety? not sure. but i dont sleep as much. during the day im wired, doing everything ,very social, less of a filter and ready to conquer the world. my husband speculates its because ive had this realization that i felt like i was so close to death. maybe ive realized life isnt guaranteed and to just live the way i please as long as its from a good place, safe, etc. im not sure but wanted to discuss what this means more with you. this episode happened on April 5th. 

I've always been thinking lately do i have any other issues besides a history of anxiety and depression? what i just described above has happened in periods of lack of sleep. same thing. im like this different person more sharp. more bold. 

I also wanted to explore the possibility I might be neurodivergent i wanted to ask you about the criteria for that for females. if you think i fit any of the criteria. i remember once reading up on it and came across this girl who had this massive list of the traits shes not a therapist. shes diagnoised i think and just said this is what shes noticed in herself and other females. i was checking so many of the bullet points she had. let me see if i can find it and if i do i will highlight the ones i relate to. 

I think that's about all i can think of in writing currently to say. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve left out some things but that‚Äôs what I have for right now.",1,1744754301.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False
1k04anw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HEB/comments/1k04anw/advice_needed_horrible_manager/,"Advice needed, horrible manager","Hello, I'm of the newer partners (since the last week of December 2024) at the HEB I work at. I don't want to give too much information away in case anyone from my store finds this, but I work in a department with a small but super nice team of dam good workers. I love the team to bits they are my girlies and I can depend on each of them with anything help wise if they have the time ofc and they can deoend on me. The locations close to home, teams awesome, everyone else is so nice too like it feels so very nice working here. Only issue? My manager. I am at a point where I'm ü§èüèº this close to asking for a store transfer, maybe department (but I really don't cause the departments honestly so nice to work in) The issue being, this manager...well for the lack of better words is just horrible. Since the first week of work she's been just so difficult to work with. Right of the bat, her training wasn't thorough. In just a week she was already throwing things at me that I wasn't trained on. When I brought it to her attention ""Hey *manager* I understand this is a task you've set for me but I don't know how to do this, this isn't something you've trained me on yet"" her response? ""Yes I did *my name* I trained you and we signed off on it and you said you understood"" and when she did finally admit she never trained me on it? ""You said you had two years of experience working in a department similar to this"" which yes I did but JCPenny is a whole different store üíÄ idk why she thought after 1 week of crap training I would just pick up on every. Little. Thing. There have been so many incidents, lots of threatening from her, example being ""hey
*manager* just a quick reminder, is this how this is supposed to go?"" without hesitant she'll hit me with a ""This is something you should know, we went over this already *my name* I've already told you once that should be enough seriously?? If this department isn't for you let me know now, if you don't like this work we can go talk to *store lead/main honcho* we can go talk to them and get you transferred to another dpt. or store if you can't do this"" and I'm  just like...I just asked for a refresher?? Where the heck is this coming from?? It's gotten to a point to where I don't feel I can go to her for any kind of help. She's always, and I mean ALWAYS talking about ""if you need help come to me, we're a team come to me"" I'm terrified to go to her because if it's not her threatening me to go to the store lead it's her threatening with a point or a write up and it's not anything where I'm like ""hey manager I forgot every single thing you've told me, tell me again"" it's just small little things like ""I've only ran into this issue once and it was a while back, am I supposed to do this? Am I doing this right?"" << that SETS her off. Or if I ask ""hey *manager* I know you said for us to do it like this but what if we did it like this instead? (A -maybe- more efficient way, she always tells us if we have suggestions go to her, I mean near daily basis she tells us that right) so I ask and what does she do? Practically yelling at me she goes ""No *my name* that's not the HEB way! Don't try to change anything and do it my way- the HEB way I mean, any other way will be a point/write up"" I've already talked to the store lead and they talked to her but all that happened was a week or two of her kissing a** - buying us mcdonalds coffee and giving us chick fil a coupons, stuff like that, and now it's only getting worse. And it's not just me either it's the whole dam team that's getting this and worse. She's apparently ""injured"" and has been throwing all her work on us and then telling us ""yall have to finish everything in time or else it's a point/write up"" which almost always ends up in us staying over for the shift because of the tasks she gave us at hand. It's not a huge team, it's a team of 4 (including her) actual members of that department and 2, sometimes 3, from other departments that help. So, not much hands to go around and right now that she's ""unable to work"" she's throwing it at us then getting mad when we don't finish 15 different things within a 8 hour shift. And lately, when she hits us with the ""let's go talk to *store leader* then!"" We say ""let's go then!"" And all she does is backtrack immediately after, I just idk what to do. There's only one other person that has complained about her to the store lead, the rest of the team says stuff to us and the other team members, complains to us but not the store lead so, sucks, but can't force them to go to the store lead you know? She never takes accountability, always points fingers at others and her way of ""touching base"" is her completely bullying a team member, making them feel incompetent, like an idiot. The team as a whole works great, everyone helps everyone, she's the only common denominator  and I just...I don't know what to do. I already know if I transfer there's 2 others that would follow (they told me themselves) cause I'm the only one keeping them ""sane/their ground point"" if that makes sense? It would hurt the team even more to lose 3 and I just don't want to do that to them, it's a great team...I don't know if going to HR would be better? Cause of the threats and the hostility, it's just- she makes it a hostile work environment, I've had days where the horrible things she says makes me cry out of frustration. I love the job, I love the team. I just can't work with a manager like that- and I've had bad managers before but this is a whole other level....please any advice would be greatly appreciated I just...idk...idk what to do at this point besides record everything she says (she's a ""says one thing, then changes it later on kind of person"" and gets mad at us for doing things she told us to do but then is all like ""I didn't say that"" hence the whole not taking accountability thing) and of course complaining, we've recently got new store leads and they're actually on top of things so we're hoping maybe they can get a transfer for her specifically if more than just two complaining but idk, we don't know what to do at this point...

Side note to add on, she has like zero sympathy for others. My aunt passed away back in March, I got the call as I was driving to work so I went into my shift with that news. I didn't think telling her would do any good (should have listened to my gut feeling) but I ended up telling her anyways because I was so very emotional. I asked to speak to her and she pulled me aside to the meeting/conference room and I told her my aunt passed and I just got told during my drive. Just saying it had me break down in sobs, I was devastated...and she awkwardly wrapped her arms around me in a weird like hover touch hug, which I get cause not everyone's into hugs, she was like ""oh *my name* I'm so sorry"" -does the weird hug- and then you know what she said as I sat there sobbing in her hover touch hug? 

""Did you do something different with your hair?""

üòê

And then she proceeded to move away and then she tells me 

""Take 5 minutes to compose yourself them come find me""

üòê

I asked her for the day of the funeral off and she was so iffy about it, it wasn't weeks in advance so I understood but the whole time she was giving off ""yeaaa I don't care"" I had to go to the MICs and all of sudden she was soooo sorry for my loss.

Please, any advice is greatly appreciated.",0,1744754292.0,HEB,0,0.5,False

Lots of players going to snowdrop to run their darkrays and hunt for more dark types, hunting for coffee mons was the most popular reason to go to ogpp, and the cyan players were rather cleanly split between those going to take it easy after the even-ts and those working on an eventual M20 run on the island.

How do you enjoy it alone?,"Hey everyone , I‚Äôm a 24-year-old female living in a cold country where we literally wait the entire year for summer. It finally comes and everyone‚Äôs out enjoying it but it just sucks that I have no female friends to enjoy it with. I only have my boyfriend and he‚Äôs not into typical ‚Äúgirly‚Äù stuff. I don‚Äôt know any other women really. There‚Äôs this neighbor girl I used to vibe with a lot but lately her energy is just off and weird and I‚Äôm not trying to be around that.

So now it‚Äôs looking like I‚Äôll be spending this summer alone again. Last summer I actually went on a solo trip to Spain. I took myself out on coffee dates, went shopping with myself, wore the cutest dresses and walked through the malls alone, tanned by the pool alone. It was all kind of cool at first but lowkey I feel like it‚Äôs getting pathetic. I swear protecting your energy too hard just ends up making you lonely as hell.

People who tolerate fake energy around them still have social lives. They have groups and friends and things to do. Meanwhile I‚Äôm out here doing everything by myself because I refuse to stay in contact with people I get a weird vibe from. But I‚Äôm starting to question if it‚Äôs even worth it.

So yeah if anyone has any ideas or advice on how I can enjoy summer alone again without falling into a loneliness spiral I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.",2,1744754125.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I've been on the job hunt for over a year since being laid off early 2024. I interviewed with a company last month, went through three rounds of interviews, with the final one being an in person interview with a panel. I thought it went well, but I ended up losing the job to an internal hire. It sucked, but I'm also aware of how companies work in that regard. The HR recruiter called me and told me she normally doesn't call candidates to let them know they didn't get it, but they wanted to let me know they all thought quite highly of me and wanted to keep my information on record in case another position opens up. She seemed very apologetic to let me down. I thought well that's nice, probably won't happen, onto the next lol.

The same recruiter reached out recently to let me know an identical position has opened up but on a different team and they were wondering if I was still interested. It's literally the exact role I already interviewed for, just under a new manager. The new hiring manager reached out to me, she would be my manager, and asked to set up an informal interview at a coffee shop to get to know me. I've never been in this position before, so I'm not really sure what to expect here. I think this may be a get to know me situation? Culture fit? What questions should I expect? She only put 30 minutes for the interview, so much shorter than the final round panel interview I had. Has anyone been in this spot?

# Worth It?

Most Redditors who own the  [UppaBaby Cruz stroller](https://go.shopmy.us/p-16076075) feel it's worth the investment if you:

1. Walk frequently or need a sturdy everyday stroller
2. Want something that will last through multiple children
3. Get it on sale or second-hand

The consensus seems to be: ""I love my Cruz so much and am just so so glad we decided to bite the bullet and buy it"" (12+ upvotes), but also having a lightweight travel stroller as a second option is ideal for many families.

This job has supported me through some of the best and worst times of my life. The owner has extended much care and understanding to me and every other employee alike, and works the hardest out of any of us. The staff here is my chosen family and has always been good to me. 

Cafe Maggie is a safe zone where any and all walks of life are welcome to come in, leave their troubles at the door, and relax with a drink or an affordable meal.
It‚Äôs home to many regulars that come every day or stay for long hours, because it‚Äôs just as comfy as your living room. 

I‚Äôve seen folks catch up with old friends, make new ones, escape the cold/heat, fall in love, make family memories, study all day and so much more. (Shouts out to those of you graduating this year. It‚Äôs been a pleasure serving you while you sit there gears turning and hazy eyed at your laptops haha) 
It has a judgement free atmosphere where people feel comfy being themselves. 

The employees try to foster genuine interactions. Order some coffee from a friend and talk about your day. No scripted greetings or needy upsell tactics. Just real human connection. 
The only thing we won‚Äôt tolerate here at Maggie is harmful or disrespectful behavior, as we try to cultivate a loving and peaceful atmosphere. 
It really is a neighborhood place, as is humbly written across the front window. 

I‚Äôve watched the city come to life, hustle and bustle of the metropolitan area, sunrise and sunset, rain or shine, through those windows at the corner of 4th and university. A perfect place to escape the chaos of everyday life and relax for a while. 

As the summer creeps in and threatens us with the lack of university students and travelers, consider stopping by to cool off with a cold drink. 

Show some support for the small business that has been supporting me and our community for years now. 

Thanks Cafe Maggie. There‚Äôs no place like home. ",12,1744754013.0,Tucson,0,0.83,False

Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôve never posted here before, but I‚Äôm feeling confused and thought it might help to hear from people who are more removed from the situation.

I (25F) started dating my boyfriend (31M) about 7 months ago. We were neighbors and became friends because of his cute dog, and things developed from there. The beginning of our relationship was rocky ‚Äî we had some misunderstandings and tough conversations ‚Äî but we eventually got on the same page in terms of expectations, and things got much better.

For context, I‚Äôm very outgoing and social. I like going out, meeting friends, and making new memories. My boyfriend is more reserved ‚Äî he usually needs a drink or two to loosen up socially, which I found endearing at first. Since we started dating, we‚Äôve spent most of our time together, and we genuinely enjoy each other‚Äôs company. But now that I look back, about 80% of that time has been indoors: watching TV, cooking, doing Legos. I like those things, but I also want to go out more ‚Äî to bars, the beach, or even just playing pool with friends. I‚Äôve brought this up, and he‚Äôs told me to go out and enjoy myself, but I guess I was hoping we‚Äôd be creating those ‚Äúyoung and in love‚Äù memories together.

Lately though, we‚Äôve been fighting ‚Äî especially over small things. He seems constantly stressed from work and the classes he started after we got together to get a better job. He gets frustrated quickly and doesn‚Äôt communicate when he needs space ‚Äî he just shuts down and then lashes out. I‚Äôm also working and in grad school, so I understand stress, but I don‚Äôt treat him that way. And if I ever did, he‚Äôd make a big deal out of it.

Here‚Äôs what happened during our most recent fight:

We woke up, took his dog for a walk, then picked up coffee. On the way home, I stopped at a small store to grab two things I needed. I parked in a marked spot, left the keys in the car with him inside, and ran in ‚Äî I was gone less than 10 minutes. When I got back, he was upset because people in the lot were gesturing at him, apparently because my car made it hard to exit. I said they were being dramatic ‚Äî there was plenty of space ‚Äî and let it go. But as I was driving home, I noticed he was still upset. I reached over to hold his hand like we usually do, and he pulled away. I got quiet and asked a few minutes later if he was okay, and he snapped, yelling, ‚ÄúLeave me alone. I don‚Äôt want anything, I just want to be left alone.‚Äù

I was hurt but decided to respect his space. We went back to my place ‚Äî he immediately went into the bedroom to do homework. I left him alone, reorganized the hallway closet and bathroom, and cleaned the apartment while FaceTiming my sister. He came out once to get a snack, smiled like nothing had happened, gave me a kiss, offered me a snack, and walked away ‚Äî all while I was still on FaceTime.

Later in the evening, he asked if I still wanted to go on the dinner date we‚Äôd planned. I said no. I made myself a plate of leftovers and ate while we watched TV. An hour later, he said he was going to head out because he had work early. I asked if this was really how he wanted to leave ‚Äî without talking about what happened. He said I gave him the silent treatment, canceled our date, didn‚Äôt check if he wanted food, and just ‚Äúhelped myself.‚Äù I reminded him that he yelled at me to leave him alone, and I was only respecting what he asked for. He kept insisting he didn‚Äôt yell, that I kept nudging him, and he only meant he wanted space ‚Äî but not all day.

We went back and forth. He eventually apologized but said I also owed him an apology for ignoring him all day. He said I always want to be right and that I make him feel like the bad guy. The next day, I went over to talk. He explained he wasn‚Äôt upset at me about the parking lot, just needed to cool off. He said he‚Äôs sorry if I felt like he yelled, but still insisted he didn‚Äôt. Things weren‚Äôt really resolved, and he ended up telling me to leave his apartment.

I sat quietly for a few minutes and then told him that I didn‚Äôt think moving in together at the end of the month was a good idea ‚Äî especially if he reacts like this and kicks me out when things get hard. He replied that if we‚Äôre not moving in together, then he doesn‚Äôt want to be together, and told me to leave again. I grabbed my cat (who I had brought over with me) and left.

As I was pulling out of his driveway, he came running out, saying, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt happening. We‚Äôre not breaking up over this.‚Äù He wouldn‚Äôt move from in front of my car until I got out. I told him I just needed a drive to cool off and that I‚Äôd come back. He took my cat back up to his place and said he‚Äôd wait.

When I returned, I found him curled up on the floor of his room. When he saw me, he pretended he was cleaning paint he had spilled previously ‚Äî but it felt like a cover. We talked. He started tearing up, apologized again, and said he blew things out of proportion, that he loves me so much and doesn‚Äôt want to lose me, and that he‚Äôs trying to be better. I love him too, and I want to believe things can improve, so I chose to let it go. We promised to be more patient with each other.

That said, I can‚Äôt shake this feeling that something isn‚Äôt right. I love him, and we do have great times ‚Äî but is this dynamic healthy? Is it normal for couples who are different (I‚Äôm very social, he‚Äôs introverted and more avoidant) to struggle this much? I‚Äôm feeling anxious about moving in. I keep wondering if relationships that are truly meant to last feel this unstable.

Sorry if this was too long, I would really appreciate any advice or perspective.

TL;DR: Been dating my boyfriend (31M) for 7 months. I‚Äôm outgoing, he‚Äôs introverted. We enjoy our time together but mostly stay in, and I‚Äôve been craving more shared social experiences. Recently, he‚Äôs been blowing up over small things and shutting down instead of communicating. Our latest argument escalated, he told me to leave, and now I‚Äôm feeling anxious about moving in together at the end of the month. He apologized and we promised to try harder, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling something‚Äôs off. Is this dynamic normal or a red flag?",1,1744754004.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

How do you enjoy it alone?,"Hey everyone , I‚Äôm a 24-year-old female living in a cold country where we literally wait the entire year for summer. It finally comes and everyone‚Äôs out enjoying it but it just sucks that I have no female friends to enjoy it with. I only have my boyfriend and he‚Äôs not into typical ‚Äúgirly‚Äù stuff. I don‚Äôt know any other women really. There‚Äôs this neighbor girl I used to vibe with a lot but lately her energy is just off and weird and I‚Äôm not trying to be around that.

So now it‚Äôs looking like I‚Äôll be spending this summer alone again. Last summer I actually went on a solo trip to Spain. I took myself out on coffee dates, went shopping with myself, wore the cutest dresses and walked through the malls alone, tanned by the pool alone. It was all kind of cool at first but lowkey I feel like it‚Äôs getting pathetic. I swear protecting your energy too hard just ends up making you lonely as hell.

People who tolerate fake energy around them still have social lives. They have groups and friends and things to do. Meanwhile I‚Äôm out here doing everything by myself because I refuse to stay in contact with people I get a weird vibe from. But I‚Äôm starting to question if it‚Äôs even worth it.

So yeah if anyone has any ideas or advice on how I can enjoy summer alone again without falling into a loneliness spiral I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.",1,1744753978.0,women,2,1.0,False

1k042yl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1k042yl/i_laughed_in_my_dads_face_after_my_mom_turned/,I laughed in my dad's face after my mom turned down his marriage proposal,"Something important before starting is that I'm 27M and my parents never married.

My paternal grandfather married my grandma after she got pregnant with his first son (my dad) and when the second baby came he found out it wasn't his, but couldn't divorce her because our family was extremely religious (not anymore) and divorce would NOT be in the table for him since it would mean all his family would cut him off, and he stayed with her until she passed away.

My dad, that saw how unhappy his father was and how it affected his own life and his half-sibling's too decided he wouldn't marry until he had a two kids of his own blood with his girlfriend. To be fair he did talk with my mom about it and initially she was okay with it since she understood how it affected him. I honestly somehow do too but it still seemed unfair to my mom, but as a kid I didn't understand at the time and as a teenager I didn't feel in the right to butt in or say anything.

Well, my parents had me and where happy, but there were no marriage plans yet, but it was fine, they just needed to have another child.

So they tried for years, and years, and years, and now here we are, his only son almost in his 30's and they are still NOT married. My mom had fertility issues but she wasn't infertile, and they attempted to get pregnant for many years depite the difficulties, but they never could. My mom suggested to go for adoption but it didn't align with my dad's the self-imposed rule of having two biological children with his partner to marry, so he declined. 

They eventually stopped trying and seemed ok together, but my mom constantly asked to get married since they were together since highschool but my dad did not want that because he wanted to marry after having two children, which was now off the table so eventually my mom gave up and stopped asking.

With that said, there was never an issue out of it that affected me directly until a few years ago.

See, as I'm an only child my parents kind of expected me to give them grandchild, and when my parents (or should I say my dad) decided to stop trying for another baby they agreed that they would marry when I have my own child. I didn't know it until 2 years ago, because a few years ago I came out as gay and evidently I won't have any biological kids (I don't discard the possibility of adoption but it's not in my plans and my dad wanted a bio grandson).

So, unintentionally, I destroyed that last hope of them helping raising my child to finally get married (although I know it's not my fault, but my dad's ridiculous norm he had for himself, so I don't feel one bit guilty or any remorse).

At this point my mom doesn't even care about marriage anymore. She is 58, and even before I revealed I was gay she didn't think she would ever get married to my dad because of how much he seemed to have in his requirements to compromise.

A few days ago my parents, two of my aunts, my uncle (my dad's half-brother) and me were celebrating my mom's birthday, and she was having a nice time, she was smiling a lot and we were giving her our gifts for her to open in the spot. 

When it was my dad's turn (it was one the first gifts) she opened it and it was a small box (no, it wasn't a ring's box, it was like the size of a necklace box so it wasn't that obvious at the moment) and when she opened it there was a paper that said ""would you marry me?"". She turned to my dad, who was getting in one knee, taking out an engagement ring out of his pocket, and waiting for my mom's response, who was looking at him with a strange look it almost seemed made me laugh by how serious she was.

She looked at him, then at my family, who were visibly more shocked than her (I was too but I was kind just staring blankly) so apparently no one other than my dad knew about his proposal plans, and she just said ""ermm... let's not spoil the moment right now, let me open the rest of the gifts"".

My dad apparently was shocked by how indifferent my mom was and sat down without saying anything while my mom went back to cheerfully open the rest of her gifts, and the rest of the family was also enthusiastic about it (maybe a bit too excessively but I guess it was to avoid thinking of the awkward moment that just happened) and after enjoying the meal we all went to our homes.

Well, that was two days ago and today my dad asked if he could come to my home and I said yes, I though he was gonna vent about what happened at my mother's birthday, and I was totally right.

He cried a bit sating how he had planned to propose to my mom after thinking a lot about it, that he was NOW ready and that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her, that he couldn't believe he humiliated him like that in front of the family, and the whole time I had to keep my straight face, but it was so difficult because of my dad's nonsense until he said the last phrase and I couldn't hold back anymore and starting laughing my ass off.

Obviously, he got mad and asked me why I was making fun of him. I don't hate my dad, but I was a little too mean to him and said a lot of stuff I didn't say as a teenager and even as an adult because it wasn't my bussiness how they handle their relationship.

To summarize, I told him something like ""I don't know what you expected after leaving my mom waiting for almost 40 years for a proposal. You didn't need to wait for her to get pregnant again just because that old hag was a cheater. Or did you think my mom was a cheater too? If she was a cheater, why did you stay? If you knew she wasn't, what was the point of that stupid goal of having two children to prove she wasn't having an affair?"", and I kept going off on him for like 40 minutes, he was so shocked I raised my voice to him since I have never done that to anyone.

He stayed quiet during my whole rant and when I finished he just avoided looking at me and simply apologized. I gave him some coffee before he left so he would calm down and possibly talk to my mom.

I think they will get married, but I was so annoyed that he decided to do it at the worst moment, in the worst place, and in front of everyone and then complained he felt humiliated as if my mom wasn't waiting for him for decades for him to not even comsider marriage until they got old. Bruh.

Not with someone else ‚Äî with you. 

I want to start over. But not in the shallow way people throw that phrase around. I mean I want to truly know you again ‚Äî not just the version I see now, but the version I once felt so connected to. Back when it was just me and you, talking for hours like the rest of the world didn‚Äôt exist. No matter who we were with or who was around.  Back when you had your apartment or your house on the Hill on the east side.  When every conversation made me feel like we were building something real ‚Äî something that mattered.

Somewhere along the way, that closeness faded. And it‚Äôs not because I stopped loving you or caring for you ‚Äî not even a little. But I do feel like something‚Äôs missing. And I‚Äôm not okay with that. Because what I want more than anything is to know you. Really know you.

What do you play when you‚Äôre angry? When you‚Äôre sad?

How do you take your coffee? What do you pray about ‚Äî and who do you pray to? Do we believe in the same God? What do you need from love, and what have you learned to live without?

I want to know how you like to be touched ‚Äî not just physically, but emotionally. I want to know what makes you feel safe, seen, and wanted. I want to learn your love language like it‚Äôs my second language. I want to understand your silence and your storms. I want to be the person who knows your heart like the back of my own hand.

And yeah ‚Äî I‚Äôm not gonna lie. Of course, I desire you. Look at you. You‚Äôre stunning. And not just in the way the world measures beauty ‚Äî you‚Äôre smart, kind, driven, hilarious, unpredictable, and sexy in the way that makes a man forget how to breathe. I don‚Äôt know what you see in the mirror, but what I see? Is a woman I want to keep discovering for the rest of my life ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs as your partner or your friend. Either way, I‚Äôm in it.

So if you‚Äôre willing to let me in ‚Äî if you‚Äôre down to go deep, be real, and let me love you in a way that‚Äôs not just romantic but honest ‚Äî you‚Äôd make this man feel like the luckiest, happiest fool alive.

I promise to respect your space and keep my hands to myself as best I can ‚Äî but Lord knows, it takes everything in me to hold back when I‚Äôm near you. Because the pull I feel? It‚Äôs not just physical. It‚Äôs spiritual. Emotional. Real.

I‚Äôm working on me. I want to be someone you‚Äôre proud to say you love ‚Äî someone I‚Äôm proud to be, too. That means falling in love with myself first, so I can love you the way you deserve.

I‚Äôm not dropping names. If you know, you know. If not, then this message wasn‚Äôt for you. But for the one it is meant for ‚Äî I‚Äôll see you when I see you. And I‚Äôll be coming after you with everything I‚Äôve got.",12,1744753171.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,6,1.0,False

Was he dead?

The thought bounced off the edges of the nothingness that lay ahead of him, rippling through the dark abyss, like a stone skimming across black water under the light of a new moon. Darkness pressed against him, thick and heavy. He tried to look around. He could feel his eyes moving, his head turning, but it was like he was underwater, in the depths of the oceans where light feared to tread.

Where was he? he wondered to the void and his thoughts echoed back to him. Then another thought appeared, more concerning than the first.

Who was he?

More thoughts appeared in the endless vacuum ahead. Images. Memories. Flashes of vivid colour against the black, like fireworks in a midnight sky. Visions flit past his eyes faster than he could decipher them.

‚ÄúMr Smith,‚Äù a voice called out. A feminine, melodic voice. His heart leapt at the sound, eyes frantically searching for the source of that beacon in the darkness.

‚ÄúMr Smith,‚Äù she called again.

Suddenly, he felt pain. Red-hot pain, spreading across his face like lightning branching through storm clouds.

His eyes fluttered open. A young woman, tall and slender, leant over in front of him. Blonde hair spilled past her shoulders like golden rivers, settling into the valley between the twin mountains straining against her tight blouse. It was like an invitation to a climbing expedition.

Had he been asleep? He couldn‚Äôt recall. His mind was a foggy haze of emptiness that he couldn‚Äôt shake away. He put a hand to his cheek; his flesh, raw and hot like his face had been pressed to a burning stove.

‚ÄúDid you‚Ä¶‚Äù he rubbed the side of his cheek, felt the heat under his palm, ‚Äú‚Ä¶slap me?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome now,‚Äù she purred, ‚Äúyou should be so lucky.‚Äù

He looked at her ‚Äì the cleavage, the blonde hair, the piercing blue eyes and he had to admit to himself. He should be so lucky.

He peeled his eyes away and looked around the room. It was some sort of waiting area, the stench of cigarettes and cheap coffee masked unsuccessfully by the perfume that clung to the girl. He was sprawled across a sofa of purple velvet fabric that hugged the wall next to a massive wooden reception desk that he supposed served as the office for the young lady hovering in front of him. Around him, the walls were plastered in endless patterns of figure eights in oranges and reds that burned his eyes. A potted plant in a bright orange vase stood guard in a corner, its green leaves swaying with uncertainty, like an unwanted guest at a party.

‚ÄúThe Gamemaster is ready for you,‚Äù the young girl said, putting a hand beneath his arm and helping him up. She pointed at a door beyond her desk.

‚ÄúThe Gamemaster?‚Äù he asked, looking into her eyes. She said nothing but nodded and led him towards the door.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll explain everything to you.‚Äù She pushed him through the door and the world faded to nothing.

\*\*\*

Was he dead?

The thought bounced off the edges of the nothingness that lay ahead of him, rippling through the dark abyss, like a stone skimming across black water under the light of a new moon. Darkness pressed against him, thick and heavy. He tried to look around. He could feel his eyes moving, his head turning, but it was like he was underwater, in the depths of the oceans where light feared to tread.

Where was he? he wondered to the void and his thoughts echoed back to him. Then another thought appeared, more concerning than the first.

Who was he?

‚ÄúMr Smith,‚Äù a voice called out. A male, deep voice. His heart leapt at the sound, eyes frantically searching for the source of that threat in the darkness.

‚ÄúMr Smith,‚Äù the voice called again.

He felt like he‚Äôd had this same experience not too long ago. Or maybe it was very long ago. It didn‚Äôt seem like the first time. Nor the second, nor the third. Suddenly, he felt pain. Red-hot pain, spreading across his face like lightning branching through storm clouds.

His eyes fluttered open.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, sir,‚Äù an old man said, leaning over. He was short and fat. Grey hair fell past his shoulders like polluted rivers, settling into the valley between the sagging mountains straining against his tight t-shirt. It was like an unwanted invitation to a climbing expedition. ‚ÄúMost people wake up quite quickly.‚Äù

Had he been asleep? He couldn‚Äôt recall. His mind was an empty void except for quiet whispers of confusion. He put a hand to his cheek; his flesh raw and hot like his face had been pressed to a burning stove.

‚ÄúDid you‚Ä¶‚Äù he rubbed the side of his cheek, felt the heat under his palm, ‚Äú‚Ä¶slap me?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome now,‚Äù the old man purred, ‚Äúyou should be so lucky.‚Äù

He looked at him ‚Äì the fleshy mountains, the grey hair, the piercing red eyes and he very much hoped he wasn‚Äôt lucky.

He looked around the room, filled with the calm scent of spring flowers and the juicy aroma of summer fruits. It wasn‚Äôt much of a room at all. Something drifted across the edges of his mind. A wooden desk. The figure eight. A plant. No such things existed here. He was cradled in a fluffy white sofa, as if sitting amongst the clouds, it‚Äôs fabric undiscernible against the limitless expanse of white that surrounded him. It was broken only by a single disc, hanging in the air a few feet beyond the old man.

Inside the disc was the image of a young man he didn‚Äôt recognise but he felt he should. Dressed in a hospital gown with faded blue dots, the man lay motionless in bed, white sheets covering half his body. It was a white man, no older than thirty, his face pale and thin with dark hair matted against his forehead. A neck brace held his head in place and tubes and wires reached out from the man‚Äôs arms to machines that surrounded the bed. A middle-aged woman, slightly plump with fading blonde hair sat by the man‚Äôs side, clutching his left hand between hers and looking lovingly at his face. A younger girl, in jeans and a sweater, slept in a chair by the window, her cheeks red and puffy.

‚ÄúWho is that?‚Äù he asked.

The old man turned to view the disc himself. ‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶is you.‚Äù

He stared at the motionless man. ‚ÄúMe?‚Äù Then he realised he didn‚Äôt even know who he was. But if that was him in the bed, then where was he now?

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not dead,‚Äù the old man said, as if reading his mind. ‚ÄúTyler Smith, twenty-five, unemployed, college drop-out. Citizen of the United States of America, on the planet of Earth. Welcome to Purgatory. Well, without the torment. Yet.‚Äù The old man laughed.

The name meant nothing to him but he understood Earth and the USA. Again, thoughts drifted across the edge of his consciousness as if his mind were trying to recall the memories but the connections were lost.

‚ÄúWhat happened to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you asked,‚Äù the old man said, skipping away towards the disc. ‚ÄúStay seated. Let me explain,‚Äù he said, as if he were giving a tour. ‚ÄúYou, good sir, were on the way to shoot up a school, but, luckily for you-‚Äù

His eyes widened. ‚ÄúWait! What?! Why the hell would I do that?‚Äù

It was strange. He knew what a school was. Understood how to use a gun. But he couldn‚Äôt recall either being in a school or holding a gun. The knowledge was there in his head but not the experiences. It was like knowing how to paint but having no visions to share.

The old man waved at the disc. ‚ÄúRecognise the girl sleeping there?‚Äù

He shook his head.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs your younger sister, Hannah. Eighteen. And she had a friend, Madison, also eighteen, that you‚Äôve known for about a year. Now, I hate to break it to you but you kinda‚Ä¶had a thing for Maddie. Asked her out. She said no.

‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt the first to say no to you, but you were going to make sure she was the last. One of those ‚Äòif I can‚Äôt have her, no-one can‚Äô situations. Luckily for you, you had a crash on the way to the school. Left you quadriplegic, brain-damaged and in a coma.‚Äù

He shifted uncomfortably in his seat and stared at the disc. If he couldn‚Äôt recognise the comatose man before, he sure didn‚Äôt recognise him now. Didn‚Äôt want to recognise him. Hitting on his little sister‚Äôs friend? School shooting? He searched his memory for any hints of such darkness, but found nothing.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying.‚Äù

‚ÄúAm I?‚Äù the old man smirked at him. Looking into the old man‚Äôs red eyes was unnerving, like he knew secrets that he wouldn‚Äôt reveal.

He turned back to the disc, looked at the younger girl ‚Äì his sister. If what the old man said was true, he had been on his way to kill her friend and there she was, face puffy from the tears she had cried. He looked at his mother holding his hand, as if she were praying for him to come back. Perhaps they didn‚Äôt know what he had been planning. Perhaps they had as many questions for him as he did. His mind was completely blank. He‚Äôd like to think he wasn‚Äôt the kind of person this old man was insinuating but he had no memory to confirm it.

‚ÄúIf I really planned to do that, maybe the crash wasn‚Äôt a bad thing. Maybe it was justice.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe it was. Maybe it was the fate of the gods for you to end up like that.‚Äù The old man looked at him and smiled. ‚ÄúBut what if you could have another chance?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat would you do if you had the choice between returning to your body as it is right now,‚Äù the old man twisted his body and swept an arm out to motion towards the disc before turning back to him, ‚Äúor returning to your life before you asked Madison out?‚Äù

The offer was intriguing.

He wasn‚Äôt sure he was the person in the disc, and even if he were, how exactly could this man return him to a time before now? When was now, for that matter? Where was here? He glanced at the endless expanse of white. ‚ÄúWhat is this place?‚Äù

The old man made pistol motions several times, like a cowboy in a shootout, before he stopped and pointed a single finger towards him with a wink. ‚ÄúThis is the world between worlds. Like I said, Purgatory, without the torment. Except, the worlds you can go to aren‚Äôt heaven or hell. Well, not literally, anyway.‚Äù

The old man gestured to the disc, and the image of the comatose man blurred, replaced with the image of a planet that looked like Earth at first glance, though on closer inspection, he saw that it wasn‚Äôt Earth at all. It seemed to have less water, less clouds and greenery, but most noticeably, from north to south was a vast region of black desert that divided the planet in two.

‚ÄúThis is Cytheria, a planet in the outer reaches of the Andromeda galaxy. It‚Äôs a game-world.‚Äù

‚ÄúA game-world?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYeah. Gain experience, progress through levels, acquire skills, increase your advantages, become as powerful as you can? Like a game.

‚ÄúSee, Cytheria‚Äôs inhabitants have been in a centuries-long war with entities from other worlds that invaded their lands. What Cytheria, and many others like it need, are heroes. Heroes to help them fight. What I do, is offer the chance of redemption for those in positions like yourself.

‚ÄúSee, here, you have an opportunity. You‚Äôre not the only one. Billions of souls, across billions of worlds, in circumstances similar to yours, given an opportunity for another chance. Granted, not all of them planned to do what you were planning but then there‚Äôs plenty that did worse.

‚ÄúNow, you could go back to that hospital bed. No memories. No guilt. Just a broken body and a lost mind. Or, you can go to Cytheria, defeat the Riftlords, and become a hero of the people. Then you get another choice. Stay in Cytheria and never return to your life or you get to go back to before it all went wrong.‚Äù

The offer was tempting. His eyes remained on the world inside the disc as he pondered on the options, but his thoughts turned to his mother and sister. Did he have a father too? How would they cope if he never came back? Did it even matter?

‚ÄúWhat would happen to me on Earth, if I chose to remain in Cytheria?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd remain comatose until your body withered away. Right now, you‚Äôre an empty shell there anyway. The heart‚Äôs pumping but the engine‚Äôs not there. Your soul, the essence of your being is right here. You‚Äôd get a new body on Cytheria or I send you back to that.‚Äù The Gamemaster pointed at the disc. The image blurred again and Tyler Smith returned, comatose, mother and sister at his side.

As he looked upon the image, wondering what this new world might hold for him, he was fairly certain that he didn‚Äôt want to go back as he was now. Quadriplegic. Brain-dead. A mother spending days and nights holding his hand, praying beyond hope that he would return. A sister, spending days and nights crying, blaming herself for having introduced him to her friend. It might have been a deserved punishment for him but it wasn‚Äôt fair to them.

And he hadn‚Äôt done the deed, had he? Intention and action were two very different things. The line between them might be thin but it was there.

‚ÄúWhat would I have to do?‚Äù

The old man smiled, mouth curling towards his eyes. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt lie to you. It won‚Äôt be easy. You‚Äôll arrive in the Kingdom of Aleria, on the borders with The Rift, the black region you see here. Over the course of your journey, you need to become a hero and join the armies or lead your own to take back the Rift. As long as it exists, its threatens the Cytherians. At this very moment, the Riftlords are attempting to break free from the barrier that holds them back. It is only a matter of time before they do. We need to defeat them. If we don‚Äôt, who knows what might happen?‚Äù

He took a look at the image of himself again. If he helped to overcome these Riftlords, he‚Äôd get another chance. Get to go back to before he made that choice. A clean slate. A chance to do things properly. Or, the chance for a new life altogether. A new world. A new life. A new beginning.

His mind was made up.

‚ÄúSo how would this work?‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that a yes?‚Äù the old man said.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre absolutely sure?‚Äù

He had a final look at himself, asleep on the hospital bed, hooked up to the machines.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure. I‚Äôll go to Cytheria. I‚Äôll become a hero.

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll win.‚Äù

The old man looked at him and smiled, hands rubbing together in glee. ‚ÄúThat I would like to see. I hope you‚Äôre the right kind of crazy to make it work.

‚ÄúOkay, first things first. Do you want the simple tutorial or the advanced tutorial?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe advanced starts you further along. It‚Äôs a bit tougher, but you‚Äôll progress faster.‚Äù

‚ÄúGive me the advanced tutorial,‚Äù he said. Anything that made the process quicker was welcome.

‚ÄúAs you wish,‚Äù the Gamemaster said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt choose a different race or gender, so you‚Äôll spawn as a human male, looking as you do now. You can choose a different name, if you wish. Anything you want, fifty character limit.‚Äù

Imtheawesomestherothatseverheroed came to mind.

‚ÄúCan I change my name after?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúTyler Smith is fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Human. Male. Tyler Smith. Once you‚Äôre there, if you say ‚Äòstatus‚Äô, it will open up your UI and you‚Äôll be able to navigate from there. Are you ready?‚Äù

He nodded.

‚ÄúBefore you go, I should warn you about one thing. If you die in Cytheria, that‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs no going back, not even to your current body.‚Äù

He nodded again.

‚ÄúThen I guess I better not die.‚Äù",2,1744753101.0,HFY,2,0.75,False

On a productive day (good coffee) I'm submitting 500-1k line patches on greenfield feature work, just using a text editor and LSP. 

I'm starting a new job where a lot of the devs love to use Cursor, so I decided I'll do my homework and try it out on one of my larger projects, a couple 100k line codebase. I'm working to try to implement a new feature, and the suggestions that Cursor is giving me is totally throwing off my thought process. There'll be times when I think one of its suggestions is neat, or saves me a few seconds of typing, but 90% of the time it's not at all what I want.

Code is an extension of my thought process, and having these pretty bad suggestions popping up every other keystroke is really distracting. I spent a bit fighting cursor tab to do what I want, tried using command-K to describe what I wanted, tried using comments to push it in the right direction, but it needed constant babysitting to do even half of what I wanted. When I turned off Cursor-Tab, I was suddenly able to think clearly and write my function.

This makes me wonder why I'm even bothering with Cursor. My biggest asset as a developer is thorough and rigorous knowledge of the systems that I'm building. The more I offload to Cursor, the more I lose that.

Does Cursor really only work on smaller projects/microservice architectures? I know people really like Cursor/copilot for boilerplate stuff, but how much boilerplate are your applications really carrying? Maybe you need to synchronize some types over an API boundary, but that's a solved problem with OpenAPI codegen tools.

We've texted every day for 4 months. 

He's bought me a few gifts. I baked him things and had his fav desserts delivered when he got promoted. 

We hung out when I was in his town. We fucked. He kissed me and rubbed my back. He wanted to see me again, for coffee, not just for sex. 

It was never official and I never expected it to be. But I really liked him, hearing from him every day made me happy. I was definitely limerent over him. When the texts didn't come when expected, it felt like there was a pit in my stomach. 

When he answered a text a way I didn't expect, it hurt. 

I never really officially asked him anything and never addressed my more limerent feelings. After we met the first time I told him I liked him, and wanted to see where he stood. He seemed to reciprocate but said he hadn't been planning on anything so hadn't thought about it more than that. I should have cut it off and didn't. 

We continued to talk daily. He skipped seeing me the second day I was in town last time. Then he sent me a gift to make up for it. 

I finally got tired of wondering and asked and I wasn't prepared for the answer. I expected the part where he told me he didn't want anything serious - but I also learned that he just... didn't have feelings for me this entire time. He's not in the right head space, doesn't have the bandwidth for anything else. 

Holy shit. How can you talk to someone every day, start the conversation, send gifts, send goodnight texts, share intimacy -- and have absolutely no feelings for the person? 

I couldn't. I guess other people can, which is cool for them.

Our Moccamaster is approaching 10 years old, and in late 2023 started accumulating fluid in a part of the carafe that shouldn't have fluid, so we replaced the carafe.

Recently, the carafe has started leaking out of the bottom after brewing a pot of coffee. It is not collecting fluid inside as far as I can tell (don't hear sloshing when shaken as we did the last time).

The drips are coming out of the adjustment point (?? not sure what to call this, its the part you could ""screw"" tighter or looser, but I saw advice to not monkey with it) on the bottom.

Despite not hearing fluid inside it, what is remarkable and interesting is the coffee that comes out the bottom is stone cold. So its not coffee from the batch just brewed.

Anyone every experienced anything like this before? Any advice?

Like Arkham, they have ended up with far too many products for any retailer to stock (they have 50 or so Phoenixborn, which are kinda analogous to investigators, but they are all sold in individual starter decks, and about six ‚Äòbigger box‚Äô products), but they have come up with an interesting solution‚Ä¶ 

They have announced that after this kickstarter they will - like Arkham - no longer be reprinting their old products. However, they have partnered with a print on demand card company, and said that going forwards you can order any of their old products either from their print on demand partner, or for a nominal fee you can download a pdf from their website and print at home. 

They are even offering custom decks, so if you play some cards a ton (e.g. in Arkham I am always running out of Guts, Unexpected Courage,  Shortcut, etc) you can order a deck (which I think is 50) of any cards you want from their IP. So even if, for example, the worst happened and someone spills a coffee over your table and takes out Zoe Samaras, 20 Guardian cards and half a scenario set up, you can just order another copy of the cards that got ruined. 

I‚Äôm not throwing shade at FFG here, but it is interesting to see a similar company with a similar product, who have come up with a totally different - and at least on face value better - solution to the problem that FFG are facing right now. ",16,1744752271.0,arkhamhorrorlcg,4,0.94,False

Fulton Street wasn‚Äôt just a street in our family‚Äîit was a kingdom, and Uncle Santo was its undisputed king. The youngest of the seven Greco siblings, he‚Äôd clawed his way up from Sicilian immigrant roots to own the ice company that kept half of Brooklyn‚Äôs fish from turning into yesterday‚Äôs news. He was a broad-shouldered, barrel-chested man with a voice like a foghorn and a wallet fatter than anyone else‚Äôs in the clan. Then there was my father, Frank, the oldest of the brood‚Äîdignified, dressmaker extraordinaire, and card-carrying member of the ILGWU. Pop was the family‚Äôs moral compass, a man who‚Äôd stitch you a three-piece suit and a sermon in the same afternoon.
The two of them were oil and water, or maybe espresso and grappa‚Äîperfectly fine apart, explosive together. Santo loved his wife, his kids, and his grandkids, sure, but he also loved a good side dish of dames. Pop, devoted to Ma‚ÄîZina, the saint of our kitchen‚Äîsaw it as his sacred duty to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù Santo‚Äôs wandering ways. Every Saturday morning, that correction played out like a vaudeville act in our Brooklyn dining room.
The doorbell chimed at ten on the dot, a sound as reliable as the church bells on Sunday. In strode Uncle Santo, arms full of fresh fish from the Fulton Fish Market, wrapped in brown paper and smelling like the sea. ‚ÄúZina, my angel!‚Äù he‚Äôd bellow, planting a kiss on Ma‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúFlounder today‚Äîcaught it myself with my bare hands!‚Äù
‚ÄúYou mean you bought it with your bare wallet,‚Äù Pop would mutter, folding his newspaper with a snap.
Ma, apron on and espresso pot bubbling, would set out the biscuits‚Äîthose hard little Italian ones that could double as doorstops‚Äîwhile Santo plopped into a chair, his appetite already growling louder than he did. That Saturday was no different, at least not at first. We gathered around the table‚Äîme, Pop, Ma, and Santo‚Äîsipping coffee so strong it could wake up a coma patient.
Santo leaned back, brushing crumbs off his shirt. ‚ÄúYou hear about my brother-in-law, Tony? Poor slob kicked the bucket last week. Broke as a joke, too. I had to pay for the whole damn funeral‚Äîcasket, flowers, the works. Me! Generous Santo, huh?‚Äù He grinned, waiting for the applause, maybe a medal.
Pop‚Äôs face went from Sundaycalm to Saturday storm in half a heartbeat. His coffee spoon clattered onto the saucer. ‚ÄúYou paid for Tony‚Äôs funeral?‚Äù he said, voice low, like thunder rolling in.
‚ÄúYeah, Frank, I did! What‚Äôs it to ya?‚Äù Santo puffed out his chest, proud as a peacock.
Pop‚Äôs chair scraped back an inch. ‚ÄúHow about when Ma died, you son of a bitch? Your own mother! You made your sisters‚Äîyour sisters, who don‚Äôt have a pot to piss in‚Äîpay their share of the funeral expenses. And you, Mr. Ice King, didn‚Äôt offer a dime to help ‚Äòem out!‚Äù His finger jabbed the air like a sewing needle. ‚ÄúYou got some nerve sittin‚Äô here braggin‚Äô about Tony when you stiffed your own flesh and blood!‚Äù
The room went quiet, except for the hiss of the espresso pot. Ma froze mid-biscuit, and I held my breath, knowing this was about to get good. Santo‚Äôs face turned the color of the flounder he‚Äôd brought‚Äîpale, then pink, then a deep, furious red. He stood up, slow and deliberate, like a bull sizing up a matador.
‚ÄúI hate everyone,‚Äù he growled, voice shaking the biscuit plate. ‚ÄúI hate my wife. I hate my kids. I hate my grandkids. I hate you, Frank. And I‚Äôm leavin‚Äô‚Äîright now‚Äîand I ain‚Äôt never comin‚Äô back!‚Äù He stomped toward the door, each step rattling the framed pictures on the wall. ‚ÄúNever again, you hear me? Never!‚Äù
Pop wasn‚Äôt done. ‚ÄúGood riddance, you cheap bastard! And next time, pay your sisters‚Äô share!‚Äù he hollered as Santo yanked the door open. ‚ÄúYou owe ‚Äòem that much!‚Äù
The door slammed shut, a punctuation mark on Santo‚Äôs grand exit. Ma sighed, picking up a biscuit and dunking it in her coffee. ‚ÄúFrank, you‚Äôre gonna give yourself a heart attack one of these days.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôll give me a heart attack first,‚Äù Pop grumbled, but his eyes softened as he sipped his espresso. ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs got a heart of ice to match his business.‚Äù
We all knew Santo‚Äôd be back next Saturday, fish in hand, like nothing ever happened. So you can imagine my lack of surprise when, seven days later, the doorbell rang at ten sharp. I peeked out the window‚Äîthere was Uncle Santo, fish bundle cradled like a baby, grinning like he hadn‚Äôt just declared war on the whole family.
He waltzed in, kissed Ma on the cheek, and then‚Äîbefore Pop could get a word out‚Äîleaned over and planted a big, wet smacker on Pop‚Äôs forehead. ‚ÄúMorning, Frank! Flounder again‚Äîbest catch of the week!‚Äù
Pop blinked, caught somewhere between a yell and a laugh. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a lunatic, you know that?‚Äù he said, but he didn‚Äôt push Santo away. Ma just shook her head and fired up the espresso pot, the biscuits hitting the table like clockwork.
They‚Äôd fight again, sure as the sun came up. Pop would ‚Äúcorrect,‚Äù Santo would storm out, and the fish would keep coming every Saturday. But underneath the yelling, the swearing, the biscuit crumbs‚Äîthere was love, thick as Ma‚Äôs marinara sauce. Santo might‚Äôve been a man of the streets, and Pop a man of principle, but they were brothers first. And in our house, that meant something louder than words.

Hard Water Filtering for ice machine and dispensing water for brewing tea and coffee. Water Test Included,"Hi, sorry this is sort of a repost but I ordered a SimpleLab water test and will include it as an image to this post.

https://imgur.com/a/XU6RekW

Some things to note from the test:

TDS: 220 mg/L
Hardness Ca, Mg: 111.62 mg/L
Hardness Total: 113 mg/L
pH: 7.14

I've been trying to figure out what system is right for me for the past few months, so here's the sitch.

1. I operate a tea/boba shop within a commissary kitchen, Southern California/ IE, go figure - the tap water is hard and I don't like drinking it.
2. I need this filtration to input from a water line, and output into:
 * commercial ice machine
 * single line faucet in order to fill water tanks with filtered water - to be used in water boilers..
3. a cheap walmart water test strip indicates hard water ~120 ppm, ~25 ppm calcium
4. Usage of filtered water is estimated to be ~35 to 50 gallons per day (from ice machine and water dispensing only)

So, to explain, essentially we run a storefront within a comm kitchen and the waterline that we can use for water filtration and ice in a remote area of the building relative to the storefront, so I can't just hook the filter output up directly to a tea boiler/brewer. 

I'm weighing between multiple systems and I know nothing about water treatment. All I want is for our water is to: taste good, end up being low in TDS for optimal coffee/tea taste, and reduce water hardness.

I'm looking at a few systems through webstaurantstore, there's the oceanlochs, high flows from 3M, everpure, scotsman, scalegard, and the RO systems. How many stages do I need? Do I need an RO system? If RO, how do I protect it from scale? If not RO, some systems have two outlets but one has a scale inhibitor (for ice machine) and the other one doesn't. I feel like I need the scale inhibitor as well for dispensing water too though? So can I split the scale inhibitor output into two lines?

Budget is $500 - $3000, I'm willing to spend money if I need to, but I also understand not needing to spend much money if I don't need to.",2,1744751898.0,WaterTreatment,1,1.0,False

Sorry to disappoint my thousands of followers, but not much fantasy from yesterday to report on. At RV Park Coffee Hour many people talked about our presentation on HS. Then we announced the topic for next Sunday‚Äôs RV Forum: Dee is going to present on the [five reasons the war in Ukraine is unsolvable](https://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/50735) for now. She is also going to present on all of her outreach efforts and research. You guessed it, Guy and Bernie are going to present the following week on the Longhouse Elem project.

Not much to report on, right? Oh, yesterday I took the Twinettes to ice-skate as usual but first picked up Lori and the three joined the other TOTIs (Terrors On The Ice) while the soccer moms gossiped. Yes, we talked about my HS presentation. Some things we ladies could talk about in this setting that were verboten at the Forum.

We did another trial run of Lori‚Äôs afterschool routine for September. She had dinner with us, got ready for bed with the rest of the kids, and slept a few hours until her Mom picked her up in the wee small hours of the morning. And I attended the Monday NA meeting. While the kids were taking a bath, I called up members to prepare for Sunday‚Äôs discussion meeting. Not much at all‚Äîso, why did I go to sleep feeling so tired?

Moving on, today the Three Sisters called in sick with the flu. I stayed back to take care of the Park office while everyone else helped out at the Daycare. Even Eulogio left Wall Street behind to take care of the tots. Again, no reason for us to be tired tonight!

I continue discussing the second section, [The Root Cause of Slander of the Law](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/a-vow-forthe-enlightenment-of-all-people-the-power-deep-within-our-lives-that-can-overcome-all-obstacles/), of the April installment of Ikeda Sensei‚Äôs lecture on The Opening of the Eyes.

Here he discusses in detail the levers, ramps, and gears behind the behavior of some leading Sgiwhistleblowers.

>Some 200 years into the Latter Day of the Law, only Nichiren Daishonin could see these priests‚Äô true inner reality of being ‚Äúpossessed by evil demons.‚Äù

Yup, people can assume the function of a priest ‚Äúpossessed by evil demons.‚Äù This High Priest across the hedges has the finally-tuned ability to have never made a mistake and never to have something to apologize for. She alone possesses the unquestioned knowledge and scholarship to determine what constitutes ‚ÄúREAL BUDDHISM,‚Äù although for centuries Buddhist practitioners have continued to adapt to their times, develop new insights into the Buddha‚Äôs teachings, and innovate. She also has the absolute right to criticize and demonize others. Yes, a suspected Blanchette stings patrols Reddit for 16- and 17-year-olds who dare to be talented, unconventional, and fall in love at young ages. Sting them with daily downvotes!

So what exactly is happening under her hood? Sensei states:

>If a votary of the Lotus Sutra loudly proclaims the truth when everyone else has lost sight of the correct teaching, evil priests who have been deceiving the people will fear exposure and therefore attack that person. 

Isn‚Äôt that exactly the behavior we are seeing at WBers? Since I am a local group leader, Secret-Entrance has me characterized as ‚Äúa sop‚Äù who has no other purpose to practicing than the hope of getting a Porsche gifted to me tomorrow. Maleficent_Canary819 demeans teachers (?) and, especially, gymnastic teachers (???). I think I am pretty similar to other group/district leaders in my chapter. I go to a meeting or two each month, chant quite a bit, call a couple of members each day, and love reading SGI publications. According to Secret-Entrance I‚Äôm being controlled by ‚Äúcharismatic relationships‚Äù and being forced into ‚Äútotal commitment.‚Äù And Secret-Entrance claims that (I?/we?/all SGI members?) live in ‚Äúthe dog park over the hedges."" Although WBers seem to demean the SGI‚Äôs practice of seeking guidance as false therapy by unqualified practitioners, two days ago Rebex999 complained about a district leader who told a member asking for ‚Äúadvice‚Äù to chant. Well, that‚Äôs just over the course of the past two days.

And what about the followers of the leading posters at WBers?

Sensei explains:

>Meanwhile, those in the thrall of priestly deception, not willing to recognize their own folly in being deceived, will shun the practitioner of the correct teaching. They will regard him with hatred and jealousy, speak ill of him and ultimately persecute him.

Folly? Well recently I read that ‚ÄúSoka‚Äù had generated ‚Äúsocial hatred‚Äù in me and how I have been indoctrinated by lying and misrepresentation. ‚ÄúSpeaking ill‚Äù of me? Of course, I am just a sock puppet (it takes one to know one) but in the past YKW has created a false ID for me, ‚ÄúJulieProngRider,‚Äù made fun of my PMAD hospitalization, attacked my family as ‚ÄúPolyFondles,‚Äù and used Google Maps to try to identify the location of Xi‚Äôs hen party. I don‚Äôt recall any WBers who asked her to dial back. 

Will this result in persecution in the future? Maybe the good people at Columbia University might caution me to be on alert.

>A society where slander of the Law is rife will inevitably become one that represses the votary of the Lotus Sutra who proclaims the truth.

A society where ‚Äúslander of the Law is rife‚Äù? Where are the fresh thinkers with new ideas today? Who can break the deadly cycle of ‚ÄúTrumpers‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúNon-Trumpers‚Äù?

-Activities
-Restaurants/Food
-Day Trips
 
Here is a quick synopsis of things we‚Äôve done and places we‚Äôve gone and/or frequented over the last 2 years:

Sightseeing

I was texting a friend of hers asking how she's doing and stalking her reposts on TikTok to see what she is thinking. Generally, all the reposts were bad but today there was one where it was quotes from stuff people have said to her like ""don't give him another chance"" ""why didn't you listen to me the first time"" etc. things like that. Anyhow, the TikTok then also said ""GOD Forbid I was in love"". We see eachother every day at school and have two classes together. She  initated small talk randomly to me yesterday about a RedBull I was drinking and showed me this coffee she got. I acted very neutral about everything. Yesterday, I also returned the necklaces she had given me. Today rolls around and she says nothing to me and barely looks at me. However, we randomly saw eachother in the hallways and she looked confused and smirked at me for a second. What's driving me insane though is that she has been walking with this guy in our second hour out of the band room (where we always go after school to grab our instruments) and I don't know why. I don't know if he's giving her a ride home or what. We have been sending eachother streaks on Snapchat and that's it. Other than that, we have remained no contact. I just don't know what she is trying to communicate through reposting TikTok's about me, good or bad and why she starts small talk with me sometimes. 


I was the reason we broke up due to me not giving enough effort and just being a bad boyfriend when it came to reciprocating effort towards the end. She had addressed my behavior twice before and I would change but to her it would only be for a week. I just really want her back and would do anything. I don't know why she is sending me mixed signals.

From what I've read and researched it's better to spend the majority of your budget on a good grinder rather than the machine itself. With that said I've been looking into grinders but I can't seem to settle on one specifically.

Namely Timemore sculpture 064, any of the Eurekas and Rockets. I'm also not opposed to a manual grinder as I typically only have 1 drink a day(I drink both milk and non milk) and at most two per weekend at no more than 1-3 shots.

Two primary questions I had as well are:

What would also be some pros and cons of manual vs auto?

Going abroad to study was always a thing among the riches and the extremely talented ones, and these types of people always got what they wanted, a good job, nice pay, nice community etc etc, regardless of race, colour, money etc and of course they too faced the same problem of politics, racism, and high prices, but they were prepared for it, rich people got away with these problems through money and the talented ones actually proved themselves and their worth.  

Now every tom dick harry wants this and doesn‚Äôt even have the basic skills of how to speak English properly and adapt to problems rather than complain, Let alone have a skill to stand out and have a will to out shine the youth of the country they are in. 

And then come and complain/rant about it, dude personally i know people who were in india with me studying in school and got separated in 9th and now they are doing their degree in New York and living a life‚ú® exactly like this emoji, why? Cuz they are rich AND talented. They have a great friend circle and network and everything. 

The very first thing about networking and people is what you bring on the table and how you can be beneficial for THEM, so they being out moneh thats it, and srsly if you go there and speak in your broken indian accent, gone ! Khalas, if you dont pay for coffees every once in a while, khalas, if you dont sponsor beer in a house party, khalas, bcz you are a f**king nobody and to gain respect and acknowledgment you have to bow down first, and then they accept you,   

This happens everywhere, you cannot expect to get friends/network like your school days. 

And they are not like your average pajeets who go there and make their own little india, no these are the people that get mixed with their own culture and lifestyle bcz that is whats expected, 

Do you expect a foreign exchange student from the USA to come here and start his own little Texas, start eating beef and horse meat and play country music loudly and celebrate 4th of july, thanksgiving, and NFL. No

Same thing broski same thing, you dont expect this from an American then why should they, 

but that person comes here and wears kurta and attends festivals/pujas and suddenly he is welcomed and fed ladoos, 

Do the same thing the US and notice the difference in how they treat you. 



And Of course the bank will give you the loan on a golden platter bcz they don‚Äôt give a flying f**k about you, all they know is through hook or crook you will have to pay it back in the next 5-6 year or whatever your loan tenure is.

30% is people who had dreams which were shattered and come here to complain bcz who wants to get out improve when you can sit and complain online, while not acknowledging that they themselves are the problem for not doing research and understanding that their skill level is below what even an average person of that country has.

50% is just people asking 

15% of people are actually trying to put some sense into people and showing the harsh truth and yes every other university will just eat up money from you this happens everywhere even in india. Its just that people ( from 30% grp) haven‚Äôt been slapped in the face yet. 

5% is just shitpost and fighting in comments and i love it. 

My percentages might not be accurate but yes this what is think of the sub

Ps: almost forgot to mention this, my close friends elder brother did two years of engineering and dropped and then did 3 years of bba in Bangalore university under correspondence and now completed his masters in Switzerland. Didnt write any fancy exams, all he did was prove how he was better than other applicants of its own country in the interview. He still tells me that the best thing he did was learn german, bcz languages over there are based on cantons(states) and this has helped him so much in building a network and get great friends. 

He goes to a coffeshop/bar and orders in german and people look at him flabbergasted and appreciate him on learning the language and ends up having a small conversation in mixed language (english and german) and tips the person.  


More than half the people dont understand how networking/friendship works. Its a art of being selfish and not being selfish at the same time, without giving you can never expect anything back, but also you shouldn‚Äôt give too much.  

Oh no but my INDIAN EGO is coming in the way and i wont respect anyone or tip anyone, bcz why should i learn their language when i can use google translate and i will do everything in my power to prove the stereotypes they have put on us. I will go to germany and not learn german and talk in broken English but why even bother talking in English when i can surround myself with even more indians who are as dumb and hopeless as me and make a chamber and shag each others cocks.  

whats a sorry, what is a thanks, what is a good morning[(xxxtentacion reference)elite ball knowledge]

Be easy on me I usually write poetry in Arabic and I found this randomly in my notes app after forgetting about it for such a long time, idk if I even intended it as a poem...

It started as a research project‚Äîsomething meant to help. I was part of a private team working out of a classified site in the Pacific Northwest. Quiet, isolated. Long drives through fog-drenched pine forests to get there. All off-grid. Just us, our labs, and the thing we were trying to grow.

We called it Project Apex. The goal? Bioengineering a next-generation survival organism‚Äîan *‚Äúevolutionary prototype.‚Äù* Something that could be used in search and rescue, even extreme combat support. Genetically enhanced instincts, learning capacity, endurance.

I was the neural engineer. I worked on the learning systems‚Äîcognitive tissue spliced from human stem cell batches. The logic was simple: animals hunt, but humans adapt. If we combined the two, we could build a creature that didn‚Äôt just follow orders, but learned from the environment. Something smart. Something useful.

But you can‚Äôt make the perfect predator without creating something predatory.

And deep down, I think we knew that.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

*It grew fast.*

We housed it in a reinforced bio-reactor tank‚Äîtinted glass, nutrient fluid, internal restraints. I watched it from the observation window most nights while the others went back to their cabins. I‚Äôd sit there with a coffee, staring at this twisted silhouette of half-formed bones and muscle fibers suspended in bluish light.

It twitched sometimes. Scratched the inside of the tank with its fingers‚Äîlong, thin, jointed too far. Like it was dreaming of movement before it had even taken a breath.

The nightmares started a few weeks in.

Dreams of being followed. Of something that looked human but wasn‚Äôt. No face, no voice‚Äîjust presence. A weight behind me wherever I turned. I‚Äôd wake up with the bedsheets soaked through, heart racing.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

It happened on a Thursday night.

Storm rolling in. Just me, Dr. Hines, and Marisol from security on the overnight shift. The other six were off-base for a weekend rotation.

Sometime around midnight, alarms went off in the gestation lab.

Hines and I ran down the hall. The tank was cracked. Internal pressure had failed. Fluid leaking out across the floor. Cables torn from the socket like they‚Äôd been pulled out‚Äîdeliberately.

*The creature was gone.*

All that was left was a smear of blood on the inside of the glass and a set of claw marks on the hatch door.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

I wish I could tell you I reacted like a professional. But I froze.

The thing‚Äîour *‚Äúapex prototype‚Äù* was in the corridor, maybe thirty feet ahead. Its back was to us. It looked‚Ä¶ wet. Gray. Long limbs. Smooth skin. Not a single strand of hair. And when it turned, its eyes caught the light like polished stone.

They were black.

Not dark. Black. Hollow.

Dr. Hines stepped forward, whispering, *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. Easy.‚Äù*

He had the tranquilizer rifle up, arms steady.

Didn‚Äôt matter.

It moved so fast I barely saw it. One blink, and Hines was on the floor. Another blink, and his throat was gone.

The sound‚ÄîGod. I‚Äôll never forget that sound. Wet and ragged and sharp, like fabric tearing underwater.

Blood sprayed across the wall.

I just stood there, breathing too loud. I made eye contact with it‚Äîfor a second, maybe less‚Äîand that was enough.

*I ran.*

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Marisol opened the emergency override and pulled me through. We locked the lab doors behind us and sprinted.

I remember her asking what happened. I couldn‚Äôt speak. I just kept moving.

We turned a corner‚Äîand found the ceiling vent torn open.

Marisol muttered, *‚ÄúOh no. Oh no no no.‚Äù*

Before I could say anything, it dropped from above.

It landed on her with a thud that shook the floor. She screamed. Fired blindly.

Muzzle flashes lit up pale limbs wrapped around her, claws sinking in, her body arching in pain. One shot connected‚ÄîI heard the shriek‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt matter. She shoved me backward.

**‚ÄúGo!‚Äù**

I ran.

I didn‚Äôt look back, not even when the gunshots stopped. Not even when I heard her final scream swallowed by something wet and final. I ran on instinct, deeper into the facility, my blood ringing in my ears. I slammed the bulkhead closed behind me and activated the internal lock.

It scratched at the other side of the door for a while. Not tearing, not pounding‚Äîjust that slow, careful scrape. I think it wanted me to know it wasn‚Äôt in a rush.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

The control room was dark, emergency lights casting red across the consoles. I barricaded the door, shaking, sweat soaking my shirt. I checked the monitors.

Camera feeds blinked one by one into static.

It was destroying them systematically. Learning where the blind spots were.

That was when I realized it wasn‚Äôt just a killer.

It was strategic.

It wasn‚Äôt hunting for food. It was hunting to understand. 

And it was getting smarter every minute.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

I tried the backup radio. Nothing. I slammed my fist into the panel so hard I split the skin across my knuckles. No satellites. No phone lines. No alarms. We‚Äôd built the place off-grid to keep our research contained.

*We succeeded.*

Now I was the containment.

I sat in silence for hours, gun across my lap, watching the dark screens. The vent in the ceiling creaked every so often. Light, subtle‚Äîlike a whisper of movement.

I didn‚Äôt sleep.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

At some point, the power failed completely.

The emergency lights faded. The hum of ventilation died.

The only sound left was my own breathing and the occasional shift of metal overhead.

And that feeling‚Äîthe weight of being watched.

I think it wanted me to know I was last.

It wasn‚Äôt just picking us off. It was reducing the variables.

When it finally came, it didn‚Äôt roar. Didn‚Äôt charge.

The vent cover dropped onto the floor with a soft clang.

And it lowered itself down.

Controlled. Quiet.

Like a spider.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

It stood upright.

Its silhouette was almost human now, but the joints were wrong‚Äîarms too long, knees bent backwards slightly, head cocked to one side. Its skin was translucent in the lantern light. Veins like spiderwebs. Ribcage too wide. No nose. Just slits. Its mouth was shut, but bulging at the seams with teeth. It towered above me.

I fired the pistol until it clicked empty.

One round hit. It staggered.

Then it growled‚Äîa low, guttural sound, almost disappointed‚Äîand lunged.

I swung the fire axe. Hit it in the shoulder. It screeched and flinched back.

I bolted for the emergency purge system.

There was one chance.

I smashed the glass, grabbed the lever, and yanked.

The purge kicked in with a metallic howl as argon flooded the lower levels. The creature scrambled backward, choking, slipping back up through the vent.

And I passed out on the floor.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

I came to hours later, coughing blood, side throbbing where it clawed me. I limped through the halls. Every room was empty. The storm had blown a hole through the outer wall. Trees swayed outside, morning light bleeding through the smoke.

Hines was dead. Marisol too. The others‚Äînever came back.

*The creature was gone.*

But it had left a trail. Blood, tissue. Smeared across the walls and out into the woods.

I should‚Äôve followed it.

Should‚Äôve made sure.

But I didn‚Äôt.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

That was fifteen days ago.

I‚Äôve been living in a disused ranger cabin about eight miles from the site. Off-grid. No one‚Äôs found the base yet. I check the news every morning‚Äînothing. No discovery. No alert.

Which means it‚Äôs still out there.

Still watching.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

I‚Äôve nailed boards over every window. I keep the lights low. I don‚Äôt cook after sunset. I carry a rifle everywhere, even to piss in a bucket. I haven‚Äôt slept more than an hour a night.

I‚Äôve heard things.

Snapping twigs in the woods. Scuff marks outside the door that weren‚Äôt there the night before. Once, I found a strip of bloody gauze lying on my porch. I don‚Äôt use gauze.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

And the dreams are back.

Only now they‚Äôre not just dreams.

Last night, I woke to a tapping on the window.

Not loud. Just‚Ä¶ deliberate.

***Tap.*** *Pause.* ***Tap.*** *Pause.*

Like a finger. One finger.

I didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt breathe.

Eventually, it stopped.

But when I worked up the courage to check, I found a handprint on the glass.

Upside down.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

I think it‚Äôs testing me.

Maybe it still remembers my scent. Maybe it thinks I‚Äôm unfinished business.

Or maybe it just likes the game.

That‚Äôs the part I can‚Äôt stand‚Äîthe idea that it enjoys this.

That somewhere inside that engineered skull is a flicker of satisfaction. That I, its creator, am just one more lesson in a long syllabus of pain.

In it, I'm in my livingroom playing with the cat. Suddenly, she sees something out the window and gets scared. I go to look and the sky is dark like a thunderstorm is coming. Then behind the clouds I can see a giant shadow of wings, and I suddenly know something bad has happened on the east coast. At first I think its a nuclear attack, but then on the TV I can see it was a earthquake or something that collapsed buildings.

In the first version of the dream, I was suddenly a kid again and me and my two sisters, also kids, went to hide with our heads under the coffee table because the blast was coming for us, although I live on the west coast and it couldn't actually reach us IRL. In the dream I was crying because I didn't know where my brother or husband were, and I could see the cat hiding under the couch. I woke myself up crying.

In the second version of the dream, I was more sure that the disaster had struck New York, and I remained an adult. I picked up the cat to go hide from the blast in the bedroom. In there my husband was napping, but I decided to just tell him when he woke up.

My character from BG3, a tiefling sorcerer, was also in there sitting on the edge of the bed. ""You should've stopped at H-Mart on the way back from work,"" he said. ""Now you might never get the chance."" I was deeply, deeply irritated by this. I took a sheet from the closet and put it over him like he was a piece of furniture going into storage. He made no move to stop me and didn't say anything, but as I put it over his face I could see tears welling up in his eyes.

I got into bed beside my husband, who was still asleep, and the cat, who was sitting at the foot of the bed by the sorcerer, and lay there waiting for the blast. I could see the sorcerer's shoulders were shaking as if he was sobbing, but there was no sound. Then I woke up because my jackass neighbor was revving his engine at 4:30AM.

The second time I had the dream I was left with this sense of unease/melancholy stemming more from how dehumanizingly I had behaved toward the sorcerer.",1,1744750434.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

For one, the taste of all of huel flavors is just, off. Its like someone added slightly used bubble gum to all of the base flavors and mixed from there. I cant explain it better then that.   
For two, for being an energy drink it seems to actually make me more tired within about 5-10 minutes of consuming it and that generally last most of the day. Its 12oz but has twice the caffeine as a normal cup of coffee. From my own personal experience, I switched to the kirkland signature green tea bags at about 25-30mg of caffeine and did a lot better. The only downside to those is heating up the tea pot.    
For three, being a vitamin drink full of caffeine might do more harm then good. Your going to pee more from the caffeine itself. Vitamin B and C are water soluble that can get depleted the more you pee while caffeine can impact how your body absorbs D, B, and magnesium.  Vitamin D helps absorb calcium and calcium itself gets extruded out of the body the more caffeine you consume meaning your losing the already lowered amount your body absorbs. 

Is the 100% of the daily value of the vitams taking into account what your body normally needs? Or is it an increased dosage to compensate for the caffeine?

 ## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness and ease of use of a Lions Mane grow kit hinges on several key features.

**Substrate Composition:** The quality and composition of the substrate are paramount for successful Lions Mane cultivation. Ideal substrates often consist of hardwood sawdust, supplemented with bran or other nutrients. The substrate should be fully colonized by the mycelium, exhibiting a healthy, white, fluffy appearance. A well-prepared substrate ensures the mushrooms have the necessary resources for vigorous growth.

**Ease of Use:** The best grow kits are designed for simplicity, catering to both beginners and experienced growers. Clear, concise instructions are essential, guiding users through each step of the process, from initial setup to harvesting. Features like pre-inoculated substrates and simple fruiting chamber designs contribute to ease of use.

**Fruiting Chamber Design:** The fruiting chamber, whether it's a bag, box, or specialized container, plays a crucial role in maintaining the proper humidity and airflow needed for fruiting. Effective designs allow for easy monitoring and adjustment of environmental conditions, often incorporating ventilation holes or misting systems. The design should also provide sufficient space for the mushrooms to develop fully.

**Yield Potential:** A high-quality grow kit should offer a reasonable yield, reflecting the efficiency of the substrate and the vitality of the mycelium. Expected yields can vary depending on the kit size and growing conditions, but reputable manufacturers will provide estimates based on ideal scenarios. Factors such as proper humidity, temperature, and lighting significantly impact the final harvest.

**Contamination Resistance:** A well-prepared and sterilized substrate minimizes the risk of contamination from molds or other unwanted organisms. Some kits include additional measures, such as filters or sterilization techniques, to further protect against contamination. Maintaining a clean growing environment is crucial for preventing contamination and ensuring a successful harvest.

 ## Core Benefits

Growing your own Lions Mane mushrooms offers several distinct advantages.

**Freshness and Quality:** Home-grown Lions Mane mushrooms are guaranteed to be fresh and of the highest quality. Unlike store-bought options, you can harvest them at their peak ripeness, ensuring maximum flavor and nutritional value. This level of control over freshness is a significant benefit for culinary and health-conscious users.

**Control Over Growing Conditions:** Cultivating your own mushrooms allows you to precisely control the growing environment, optimizing conditions for optimal growth and yield. Factors such as temperature, humidity, and lighting can be carefully managed to create the ideal conditions for Lions Mane development. This level of control is particularly appealing to experienced growers seeking to maximize their harvests.

**Cost Savings:** Over time, growing your own Lions Mane can be more cost-effective than consistently purchasing them from stores. While the initial investment in a grow kit is required, subsequent harvests can provide a steady supply of fresh mushrooms at a fraction of the cost of retail prices. This makes it an attractive option for regular consumers of Lions Mane.

**Educational and Therapeutic Value:** Growing mushrooms can be a rewarding and educational experience, providing insights into the fascinating world of fungi. The process can also be therapeutic, offering a relaxing and engaging activity. Many growers find satisfaction in nurturing their own food source and learning about the intricacies of mushroom cultivation.

 ## FAQs Section

**How long does it take to grow Lions Mane mushrooms from a grow kit?**
    Typically, it takes between 2 to 4 weeks from the time you initiate the fruiting process to harvest your first crop of Lions Mane mushrooms. This timeframe can vary depending on the specific kit and the environmental conditions in your growing area.

**What are the ideal environmental conditions for growing Lions Mane mushrooms?**
    Lions Mane mushrooms thrive in cool, humid environments. The ideal temperature range is between 60-70Êé≥F (15-21Êé≥C), and humidity levels should be maintained between 85-95%. Adequate indirect light is also necessary for optimal growth.

**Can I get multiple harvests from a single Lions Mane grow kit?**
    Yes, it is often possible to obtain multiple harvests from a single grow kit. After harvesting your first flush of mushrooms, you can rehydrate the substrate by soaking it in water and then returning it to the fruiting environment. Subsequent flushes may be smaller than the first, but they can still provide a significant yield.

**What should I do if my grow kit becomes contaminated?**
    If you notice signs of contamination, such as green or black mold, it is best to discard the kit to prevent the spread of contamination to other areas. While it might be tempting to try to salvage the kit, the risk of consuming contaminated mushrooms is not worth the effort. It's important to maintain a clean growing environment to minimize the risk of contamination.

She did ask me to hang out and I agreed. That's how our friendship blossomed. 

But I realized that she has been using me as an unpaid therapist. She's been ranting to me about her dating woes - I've never been in a relationship so maybe that's why she's turning to me. 

lately I've been struggling with mental health issues. I haven't checked my messages on IG or any other social media platforms for a while. Today I got a message from her that she's ""done healing"". Then she asked if I would like to catch up over a coffee. 

I got mad. She never dared ask how I've been feeling and then when she feels all better, she messages me.

This morning I got a message from another so called friend that she would like to talk to me on FaceTime. it sounded serious but I'm pretty sure she wanted to talk to me about finding a job. The last time we spoke was years ago and it was about the job market. 

If I cut off these friends, I will have no true friends. It's been hard finding friends and I'm sure most of you have experienced that. ",0,1744749723.0,AskWomenOver30,2,0.33,False

Pain management?,"Hi there, I'm on a journey of figuring out if I have endometriosis or interstitial cystitis which are the two things my doctor said. I've been having really bad, constant pain for about a month now and it came out of the blue and progressed to where it is today. I already made a post about this a couple days ago. 

The doctor sent a referral to a gyno (who still hasn't called me for an appointment) and he said it will take at least two weeks to book an appointment. I NEED to manage the pain. It's affecting my life too much and I've already missed too much work. Ibuprofen and a portable heat pad is the only pain management I have now.

My symptoms are almost all bladder and pain related. What I am eating hugely affects the pain as well. I can't eat gluten due to celiac but normally I eat fairly okay apart from little treats here and there (some chocolate, mostly dark or a fun drink like matcha latte).

I have noticed that any consumption of coffee, chocolate, processed sugars/foods and high acid foods like lemons are hurting me so much. I don't know if this is ""normal"" under endometriosis but I need like a diet to follow. I can't just be eating plain popcorn and unseasoned chicken breast for weeks while I wait for a call üò≠. Does anyone have insight to this? I have no internal bleeding, no UTI and I'm not pregnant. I just need to know what foods typically hurt Endo if any at all.

I've been seeing a therapist about anxiety (doctors request, another ADHD ""non-believer"")

My therapist said something along the lines of ""why don't you just get a job""
 I don't have energy to explain to her why! (Actually may not bother here eitherüòÖ)

I swear I have come across several articles that talk about how it can be very difficult for undiagnosed ADHD people to keep regular jobs for long periods of time- serious medical ones by serious doctors/psychologists and all the other kind. 

But now when I want to send them as a reference I can't find any of them, of course. 
So perhaps some of you have come across the same sort of thing and CAN!?
If so please share
üëçüôè



The shortest version I can muster:
20 year long story about my career. 
Loosing jobs. 
Getting mega depressed. 
Not working. 
Then starting the cycle again, more or less.

I'm not saying ADHD makes us bad at work. I am excellent at my job but 

a) I don't know how to stop/hyperfocus and always exhaust myself. I give what is asked of me but that is always too much. Saying no also didn't seem to work out for me as I was always pointed out as 'difficult'


b) I don't survive long in ""meeting heavy, ""busy just to be busy"" style office jobs, 
in open plan settings where you just have to ""live out your days with sealed windows and aircon, covered in other people's noise, lunches, nail filings, new clothes chatter and other things that makes me feel ill). I handle it baldy after a while and I hide it poorly after about 6-9 months

c) I did apply for a job at a bakery but didn't get it. Also didn't get loads of other jobs I tried. I also didn't get the jobs that I have qualifications for when I apply, on a regular basis when I see one. But I will be honest with you. Working in a coffee shop with the steam foam thing!? And loud music to cover it up. And people shouting because they can't hear anything over all the other noise. And then standing up for 7-8 house with my knees and joints that have been 'hyper tense' for my whole life and now I have meds and can relax better everything just hurts like hell. And I'm exhausted all the time. Like long Covid except not because everyone just thinks I'm lazy.
And I got out of a from severe alcohol addiction about 4 years and moved abroad 3 years ago and got diagnosed with ADHD 1 year ago and bought an apartment that I'm renovating 1 month ago so how DARE YOU tell me to ""just get a job!"" 

d) I need this article as a reference for the therapist as past of my explanation for why I have asked to discontinue my therapy there.

Ever stumbled upon a product that's priced differently at various stores? Well, that price gap is actually an opportunity that savvy traders have been leveraging for ages! üéØ Today, I want to talk about arbitrage trading‚Äîa strategy that allows you to profit from those pricing discrepancies across markets. 

Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of what you need to know:

- **What is Arbitrage?** It‚Äôs the process of simultaneously buying and selling the same asset in different markets to take advantage of price differences. Imagine buying a coffee maker online for $50 less than in-store‚Äîjust like that, but in various financial markets!
  
- **Key Types of Arbitrage:**
  - **Spatial Arbitrage**: Profiting from price differences across geographical boundaries.
  - **Statistical Arbitrage**: Leveraging patterns in price movements to identify short-term discrepancies.
  - **Crypto Arbitrage**: Exploiting the rapid fluctuations in crypto asset prices across different exchanges.

- **Risks to Consider**: While arbitrage is often seen as ""risk-free,"" it carries potential pitfalls:
  - Execution risks (prices can change before your order is executed)
  - Transaction costs that can diminish profit margins
  - Liquidity risks that make it difficult to capitalize on opportunities

- **Why it Matters**: The continuous pursuit of arbitrage helps correct market inefficiencies, which is crucial for maintaining fair pricing across markets!

And if you're just starting out, take heed! It‚Äôs wise to begin with simpler types of arbitrage and use smaller positions to manage risks effectively.

- In season 4 when Jenni was Postpartum and she wanted to put her makeup on before having breakfast he makes it a big deal just because she wants to feel nice and slams the door with baby Meilani in his hand and he full on yells and screams at Jenni too.

1k01wv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1k01wv4/suggestions_for_cold_brews/,Suggestions for Cold Brews.,"Summers are here and I need suggestion for cold brew blends.

I like my cold brews fruity but most of the times when I've tried making cold brew from beans having fruity notes I was never able to extract that fruityness, I've rather had good experience with orange peels.

Have tried 
1.Devans (Viennese Blend / Monsoon Malabar)
2.Baarbara Coffee (Cold Brew Blend)
3.Blue Tokai ( Cold Brew Blend)
4.Roseette (Dusk & Dawn Cold Brew Blend)

So far Devans & Baarbara have been my favorites.

Would love to try some more recommendations.

Also there seems to be a lot of difference of opinion about if Lighter Roasts or Darker Roasts for CB, what kind of roast would be ideal if I'm looking for a strong citrusy but puncy flavour profile.

Also most of the times I order my coffee in Pre-Ground form for CB, I know freshly grinded coffee makes a huge difference when you're making hot coffee but does making CB also require fresh ground coffee or it doesn't matter?

If yes can you guys suggest a good manual grinder.

My usual brewing methods are, French Press, Mokapot, Cold Brew, I would like to get into pour-overs and maybe espresso, I was thinking about getting Timemore C3S, but from my limited understanding I know that it's not good for Espresso level grinds.",1,1744748184.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

I am essentially asking for a magic potion.

I currently have a retail gig that is way too hard on my body and don't have other options for work.
There are no regular breaks or sitting. 
I have a cane, 4 other autoimmune besides Crohn's, and the strain has been causing more hypoglycemia attacks (a result of Crohn's and lack of Imodium) than I've had in this short of a timeframe ever.

I want a drink or snack in my locker that'll fix everything magically before it becomes and attack. Or something for my coffee?  Like a slow release carb/sugar?  Do people have faves?

And yes, the idea of getting HR involved for accomodations has crossed my mind but will likely result in fewer shifts and further highlighting that I am not as able-bodie everyone else.
I know that isn't idea but I'm trying to focus on what I can do without involving corporate.

Extra points of suggestion is order-able at Starbucks and not a chalky tablet.

Looking for someone who‚Äôs tired of swiping and wants something deeper. I‚Äôm a laid-back, 5‚Äô8‚Äù guy with a warm sense of humor and a love for balancing cozy nights with spontaneous adventures. After work, I unwind with gaming (RPGs, indie titles, or anything with a good story) or exploring underrated spots‚Äîlike Astra Lumina, that trippy forest art exhibit I checked out last month. Concerts, museums, and low-key hangs are my vibe, but I‚Äôm equally down for marathoning shows or debating the best way to eat a taco at 2AM.

I value loyalty, honesty, and emotional openness. Life‚Äôs messy, and I‚Äôm not here to judge‚Äîjust to build a partnership where we can laugh at inside jokes, hug it out when things get tough, and push each other to grow. You‚Äôre introverted but have a big heart, maybe a little nerdy about something (tell me your obscure passion), and prioritize health without taking life too seriously.

If you can make some pho, you have my attention.

Not on apps because they feel impersonal. If you‚Äôre a homebody who occasionally craves live music or deep talks under the stars, let‚Äôs chat. No rush‚Äîjust two weirdos seeing if our chaos aligns.

About me: Peanut butter-skinned, 160lbs, affectionate, and the designated Wi-Fi fixer in every friend group. I‚Äôll make you laugh, remember your coffee order, and stick around when things get real.

It might not sound like a packed itinerary, but for us, it was the perfect balance between enjoying the hotel and soaking in the Hawaii experience. We got to relax, explore, and make memories without feeling rushed and that‚Äôs exactly what we needed.

The most impressive food I remember was Matsumoto Shave Ice!! totally lived up to the hype. So refreshing and just the right kind of sweet.

Day 6- we had a plan to go Kualua ranch, but we were all tired. So, we didn't go. But everyone says it's worth it. So check it out. We also didn't do Luau to save some money. ",11,1744748107.0,VisitingHawaii,2,1.0,False
1k01tcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1k01tcs/i_got_into_grad_school_after_an_informal_meeting/,I got into grad school after an informal meeting with the program director,"Two weeks ago, I applied to a new executive master‚Äôs program designed for professionals with 8+ years of experience‚Äîeven though I have 3 years, a lower undergrad GPA, and strong recommendations. Yesterday, the program director reached out to schedule a 30-minute Zoom today to talk about the program and gauge if I was ready.

During our conversation, I opened up about being a first-gen college student who had to navigate higher ed alone, how I eventually found my footing, and how I'm now doing director-level work as a mid-level employee while my department searches for a new leader. She appreciated hearing my story beyond what was on paper and said she didn‚Äôt want my application dismissed just based on stats.

She ended the call by suggesting we meet for coffee and said she‚Äôd speak with her team. An hour later, I followed up with a thank-you email, shared some additional info, and even asked for materials to help me prep since she initially had concerns.

She replied saying I‚Äôm an *impressive professional* and gave the green light to admit me! I‚Äôll be hearing from the school soon. Feeling incredibly grateful.

I literally had no intentions of applying to this school because it wasn't my top choice, but as I prepared for my meeting with her last night, I actually realized that this program would benefit me more.

For example , once my mind said : Ask for coffee ! when woman entered the room and ffs , she sat opposed to me with freshly brewed coffee .

Once I red Jung and he was saying something along the lines : Older mind had commanding voice (gods commands) which disapeared as we evolved and voice became our own .

I'm not really sure about exact sentence but it was something like that .

Not only that but images pop into my mind. Sometimes I do posses control over them but sometimes they just enter my mind .

Lastly , I also see myself as someone else . As if you took the person , image of them and literally had it as your own aura . Like when I sing songs out loud I literally see myself being the singer . 

It's weird and I wasn't always like that but I just got these strange powers/hindrances and I'm not really sure where to look for answers or how to use this to my advantage because it's quite distressing sometimes when such a thing is new and you know nothing about it.

Last thing regarding this : Aleister Crowley once mentioned that there are three types of (??? I don't remember what ) .. . Vision , voice and ritual and I'm honestly capable of all three things since I can hear the voice , see the image or literally embody god of my choice (famous singer for example ) and else follows .

Any idea what to do , how to master it or what to read ? Thanks. ",1,1744747915.0,Jung,17,0.57,False
