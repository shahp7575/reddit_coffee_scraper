My question is whether or not this looks ok? It has had a power steering replacement back in 2018 before I bought it. 
Does this seem a little more on the coffee with alittle milk side than it should for only that short of a time span, or am I just paranoid?

1qcxzew,https://i.redd.it/09ak0gd0hddg1.jpeg,14 days in and I am horrified,"I knew I wanted to make changes and have more control in 2026. It’s going to be a rough year for me and my partner as both of work contracts come to an end. It’s important for me to have my own financial cushion. I’ve been strict with my spending but do not feel like I’m missing out at all. 2 weeks in and £463 saved! So what haven’t I bought?
- daily (sometimes twice daily) coffee
- breakfast and lunch on the go
- commute snacks from convenience stores
- a milk frother 
- two takeaways that we wanted but made takeaway 
- haircut and dye (done at home)
I am blown away by how much this would have all added up to, granted I am buying food and cooking from home but it comes in at 1/4, if not less, than if I were buying out everyday. I’m so proud of myself. Thank you all for posting here and keeping me inspired!!

Me [24M] and It’s been about a year since I moved to Bangalore. Up until now, my life has mostly been about work and setting up my place in Whitefield. Now that I have some breathing room, I’ve realized I haven't explored any of the places I’ve been wanting to see.

The ""new city"" loneliness has been hitting a bit lately, especially with the start of the year, and I really want to change that. I have a bike and a long list of scenic spots bookmarked on my maps—mostly places outside the city (30km to 100km rides).

The Plan:

The Ride: Looking into some hidden dams/hills outside the city limits.

Transport: I have a bike. You can either hop on the back (we can split fuel expenses) or bring your own bike and we can ride together.

Who: Irrespective of gender, everyone is welcome! Just looking for some good company and a shared love for the road.

The Vibe Check: Since we'll be heading out of the city, I’d like to chat a bit or grab a coffee in Whitefield first to see if our vibes match.

If you’re feeling a bit stuck in the routine and want to explore the outskirts, please shoot me a DM. Let’s make this year about more than just traffic and tech parks!

Link: [https://youtu.be/ihYMEEgomTk](https://youtu.be/ihYMEEgomTk)

The story begins in 9th century Ethiopia with a goat herder named Kaldi, whose goats became inexplicably energetic after eating certain berries. This simple observation would eventually lead to a molecule that now sustains 2 billion cups of coffee consumed every single day.

But the real story is what happens in your brain.

The Neuroscience:

•Throughout the day, your brain produces adenosine as a byproduct of energy use

•Adenosine binds to receptors and makes you feel progressively more tired

•Caffeine is structurally similar to adenosine—so similar it fits perfectly into adenosine receptors

•But instead of activating them, caffeine blocks them

•Your brain thinks there's less adenosine than there actually is, so you feel awake

•It's not that you're more rested—you're just blocking the signal that tells you you're tired

The Consequence:

•Your brain responds to chronic caffeine use by creating more adenosine receptors (tolerance)

•You need more caffeine just to feel normal

•Stop drinking coffee? Adenosine floods in like water through a broken dam

•The result: pounding headaches, crushing fatigue, irritability—withdrawal peaks at 24-48 hours

The video covers all of this with animations, plus the fascinating history of how caffeine fueled the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution.

“My daughter could have been killed!” Shouted mister hagakure.

“My son was shot” misses kirishima quietly seethed. Nezu was getting a migraine trying to explain to the humans why this was a bad course of action. And then the students came in. Most were grown. UA was a collage. The parents didn’t just have to convince him. They needed to convince them. But they figured telling the principle to kick their kids out of collage would be easier. 

Inko wanted to shout, kick and yell herself. But she kept quiet

“Dad I’m not leaving my friends!” Mina glared. “I’m not leaving ejiro”

“Honey this is dangerous” mister ururaka tried to explain.

“So is construction dad. How many times have you been hurt? How often have you been electrocuted. No money without a little risk”

Finaly nezus phone buzzed. “Ah! One last person to join the meeting”

Ojiros dad raised an eyebrow “ but I thought everyone was here?”

“Everyone in Japan. But we have several peaple outside Japan. One of whom wants to join us via video call!” He gave inko a sad look. 

Up on the screen was a tired looking man with a beard and ponytail. He sipped coffee from a mug. He wore a blue button up. His eyes met izukus moms. They turned sad “hey inko”

“Crane” Inko gasped. 

“Dad?” Izuku couldn’t believe it.

“Hey buddy! You got into UA! That’s so cool. Sorry I’m late bud i… I just got out of a house with about 2 thousand pounds of ammonium nitrate wired. Greetings! From sunny Yemen “

“As we were saying” misses yaoyarozu said. “We were discussing this… inserection. This war. And how our children shouldn’t be fighting it.”

“…ok, cool. That’s a great plan” mister crane said.

“What?!” Shouted both inko and izuku.

Crane lit a cigarette. Nezu said “good idea” and lit one of his own.

“Allow me to give you… and experts explanation. On what happens. You take away the heroes. You think those losers will just stop? You don’t think they won’t go door to door. Killing you, your children? You think the moment they stop trying to be heroes these insurgents won’t come to your house and make examples of them? Jesus tap dancing Christ.” He took another drag from his smoke.

Everyone looked at izuku. 20 years old. Paid for collage with a short stint in the military. Deployed as a UN peacekeeper to the Philippines. He was tough. He was scary. He was also a life saver. A medic. With a gun. 

Mister crane rolled his chair back. He pointed behind him. A city burned. “That is ma’rib. That is what happens when’s when someone else is left to take care of your problems… all your gonna do is leave izuku outnumbered. Izuku… what happens when you’re outnumbered?” Crane asked his son.

“… you stop holding back” izukus voice was close to breaking. He was… far away. In a worse place. Mina stepped closer to him. She wanted to take his hand. 

“All of you may be able to convince your own kids. But do u know who u won’t be able to convince? Izuku. I know my boy. I won’t even try. Izuku would do this alone… he could win it too.”

Izuku closed his eyes. Mina took his hand. Jirou stepped behind him. Resting her head into his back. “Those girls seem close… do they know? About those medals? How you got them?”

Izuku hid his medals. Never talked about what he saw. 

“Izukus the only hero. You know what happens? A lot more blood. And death. Becouse when my son gets backed into a corner you think he’s going to keep any of these villians alive? No… no he’s going to do what he was trained to do. What he did in marowi. “ the man raised his mug of coffee “slay em all son.”

There was a reason crane and inko seperated. His nightmares. His harsh nature. 

“More heroes means more arrests. Your kids r my boys limiter. They keep the bad guys alive.”

“I’ll never be you dad” Izuku tried. He knew what his father did in a prison camp years ago to unarmed prisoners. 

“Then you’ll die… and I don’t want that. I don’t want you. Or your mom to get hurt. And you’ll see why I am the way I am son… I thought the Philippines would have taught you that”

“It taught me how much teamwork matters” Izuku grumbled.

“… is all for one going to hire you?” Inko asked

Crane looked up “there will never be enough money to make me operate in Japan”

Inko knew who her ex was… he wasn’t a bad guy… he worked for bad guys. He was a merc for the highest bidder. 

“So go ahead. Take your kids. Pray them being former heroes doesn’t get them killed… and watch the six o’clock news as my son becomes me. Takes a belt fed and rakes across the mods of villians” he seethed as Mina finaly had enough and threw acid on the laptop. She pulled izuku into a hug and drug him away. Jirou hugged inko. Leading her off too. Momo stepped forward for the class. 

“Incase you haven’t figured it out yet. We’re not children anymore… making us leave won’t help Japan… we’re staying”

Every parent was in shock. Mister crane had… well they all thought nezu was an asshole. They this was a horrible situation. But him? Getting his own son into this? What they didn’t know was what made inko divorce crane. When he showed up to reanforce the UN several years ago. How he helped. And encourage his son to kill… to ‘be a hero’

But he was right. If they took their kids. We’re would they hide? Who would step up? 

They left the room. Seeing ignoring the sounds of crying from izuku in a broom closet as Mina and jirou hugged him and calmed him down. As he told them of the 20 he slew. Of the fact that dispite getting into heroics to save lives. Promising to never take one again… he was in another war. He promised him mother he would never go to war again.

He’s not my teacher, I’m just his TA. There is a significant age gap between us, but it doesn't matter to me. He is 38 and I am 23. Since day one, I had huge crush on him. 

With time, we got closer. After I found out from his students that he isn’t married, I started to develop serious feelings for him and I told him. At first, he hesitated. He kept his distance. But slowly, he came closer.

We spent time together. Lunches, dinners, coffee. We hugged, kissed, stayed close, breathed each other in. We never crossed boundaries beyond that, but it still meant something to me. In person, when we’re close, he tells me he loves me. And in those moments, it feels real.

But online, it’s different. We don’t talk much. Today, I asked him through WhatsApp, “Do you really love me?” He said, “I don’t know. But I really like you a lot.” That one line broke me. After everything we shared, after all those moments, hearing that he doesn’t even know how he feels crushed me.

I don’t think he’s using me. I really don’t. His intentions have always felt sincere. He’s not into social media or constant texting. He lives in his own world... research, work, teaching. Still, it hurts so badly. When he’s close, he’s sure. When he’s distant, everything feels uncertain.

Now I’m just stuck. Crying. Overthinking. Wondering what all of this meant to him. Wondering if I imagined something that was never fully there.

Atmosphere is generally pretty laid back, they are often more trendy than Starbucks decor wise, but the prices are out of this world! 

I just walked down to a local shop and, as I had never been, I went with a usual crowd pleaser, a Caramel Macchiato. It is amazing, but it definitely needs an extra shot of espresso... only problem is I am pretty sure if I had added an extra shot, I would have had to take out a second mortgage to pay for it LOL 

No size options, but the size they give is pretty generous (unlike a few other shops I have tried in this area, where their only size is a tall cup)... its equivalent to a Grande. But HOLY EFF, it was $8!!!! $2 more than had I ordered a Grande Caramel Macchiato at my local Starbucks (Canada so the prices differ from US prices). Also wasn't able to modify it, which is Starbucks whole claim to fame.

I’ve tried Preston’s recipe with T92’s and clever dripper- haven’t had good results.

1qcxr3q,https://i.redd.it/ulps9g7ifddg1.jpeg,Remind you of someone?,"We all know she’s a narcissist, but she also very obviously has histrionic personality disorder. To have two untreated cluster b personality disorders is so concerning. The reason she’s not getting help is because narcissists rarely seek help, and on the rare occasion they actually do, it’s to seek sympathy and pity (aka narcissistic supply), not to get real help. Narcissists are wholly incapable of really working on themselves to get better. This is why if you ever find yourself in a relationship with one it’s best to cut your losses and go and never believe their attempts to convince you they’re trying to be better. 

When we see her eye fucking herself, sexualizing breastfeeding, outsourcing her decision making (“Jesse do I want hot or cold coffee?”), go on those manic rampages, constantly needing external praise and validation, etc that’s the histrionic pd doing its thing. The comorbidity of NPD and HPD is brutal, especially for all the people around her whose needs are constantly being subjugated to hers. She’s not temperamentally capable of changing or healing herself or caring about anyone other than herself. I agree with recent comments that all our well meaning advice and attempts to help her are a waste of time. 

As is so common with such severe personality disordered people, they do not exist in a vacuum. You see an entire family system set up to enable and appease them instead of hold them accountable. She has architected her entire life in order to perpetuate and feed her personality disorders. Anyone who calls her on her shit is blocked, demonized, and unceremoniously discarded. The ones who remain are the enablers. They benefit from the arrangement too, from the love bombing and lavish gifts which come at regular enough intervals to keep them justifying to themselves that it’s not all bad. 

It really, really sucks to be Fran. But it sucks even worse to be her children who will experience a lifetime of emotional and physical neglect, invalidation, and the deep trauma caused by a million unmet needs. Kids who grow up in households like this more often than not arrive into adulthood with complex-ptsd, depression, anxiety, and are at much higher risk for suicide, addiction, and risky behaviors. Having a parent with untreated personality disorders does sooooo much damage to the kids. Severe, lasting, irreparable damage that will take these kids their entire lives to heal from.

I've tried to stay as true as possible to the RFL Handbook:  
\- 4 meals a day, \~180g protein, minimal carbs and fats, spoons of salt  
\- 1 free meal and 1 carb load per week  
\- I lift 2-3 times a week, usually 2 sets of 3 exercises each in the 6-8 rep range, one for legs, one for upper body, or for lower body. I walk \~6k-10k steps a day but don't track it much.  
\- My goal is to time my free meals or carb loads for afternoons after lifting.  
\- Supplements: I bought some fish oil capsules at Costco and take a couple 3 times a day. I also do a daily multivitamin, Vitamin D, and creatine 5g daily

What have I been eating?  
\-Breakfast: protein shake with whey and casein, mix with salt, creatine, cinnamon  
\-Lunch/Snack/Dinner: egg whites with salsa; air fryer chicken breast (goes from frozen to cooked in \~20 mins at 375); sliced turkey or ham; ground turkey w taco seasoning

How do I curb my sweet tooth?  
\- A sip of a chocolate fairlife shake after each meal. Occasionally a spoon of ice cream.  
\- In between meals, coffee or herbal tea with Splenda, Diet Dr Pepper or diet sweet tea, club soda with Mio  
\- Brush my teeth right after dinner (this has been the single biggest fix outside of cutting out alcohol)

Today is my first carb load. I've seen anywhere from 1g-6g/lb carbs in the 5hr window, but I'm HUNGRY, and as long as I keep the fats and sugars low I'm going to eat until I'm satisfied, mostly whole card

So far I've dropped 11lbs and 1.5in off my waist in the first 12 days. My goal is to run this through the end of the month, take a 2-week break, and run it again for another month, stopping around mid-March so I can do a \~10 week slow bulk heading into June.

1qcxqg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qcxqg8/compliance/,Compliance.,"The knock came at 11:17, when the sun was doing that smug thing it does in winter—bright as a brand-new dime, cold enough to make the air feel like it could crack.

I was at the kitchen counter with a mug that said WORLD’S OKAYEST MOM—a gift from my sister back when she still thought sarcasm was a love language. The coffee smelled burnt because I always let the Mr. Coffee sit too long. The radio was on low, one of those hosts who laughs at his own jokes like it’s his job to keep the world from noticing the silence.

The knock wasn’t urgent. Not frantic. Not even annoyed.

Just… polite.

Three taps. A pause. Two taps.

I remember because my brain does that when something is about to go wrong. It starts inventorying details like it’s building a case file against the moment.

I wiped my hands on my sweatshirt and looked through the sidelight.

A man stood on the porch with his shoulders relaxed and his smile ready. Bright orange vest. Clipboard. Ball cap with a logo I couldn’t quite read in the glare. One of those faces that already looked familiar before you’d ever seen it—like he came standard with neighborhoods, like mailboxes and lawn ornaments.

He raised his hand and waved at the glass as if we were old friends and I’d just been slow to answer.

I should have checked the camera feed on my phone first. We had one. We paid for it. We liked to pretend that made us modern and safe.

Instead, I unlocked the deadbolt.

Because it was broad daylight. Because my neighbor’s kid was riding his bike up and down the sidewalk, shouting “Watch this!” at no one in particular. Because the world looked normal enough to trust.

The man’s smile widened a fraction, like he’d been rewarded.

“Morning!” he said, bright as cereal box sunshine. “Sorry to bother you. Won’t take but a minute.”

His voice had that pleasant, local-news tone—friendly without being intimate. He held up the clipboard, angled so I could see the top sheet without actually reading it. A neat grid of lines. Checkboxes. The kind of paper that says procedure.

“What’s this about?” I asked.

“Quick safety check.” He said it like he’d said it a thousand times and nobody ever argued. “New compliance thing. They’ve been rolling it out street by street. Fire and carbon. Real basic.”

I frowned. “We just had our detectors replaced last year.”

“Perfect,” he said, like I’d just given the right answer on a quiz. “That makes this even easier.”

He glanced—not at me, not at the doorframe—past me, into the house, like the hallway behind me was part of his checklist.

Then he looked down at the clipboard and smiled again, almost amused.

“And you’re Maren.”

Something cold slid along my ribs.

“I—yeah,” I said. “How do you—”

“Oh, it’s all here.” He tapped the paper with the pen. Friendly little tik tik. “Address lists, occupant names, the usual. Don’t worry, I’m not psychic.” He chuckled, like that was a joke he loved.

He held the clipboard closer. For half a second, I saw my address printed in a crisp font. My last name. A phone number I recognized.

Normal things, presented in a way that made them feel borrowed.

Behind him the street glowed, too bright. Sunlight bounced off the hood of my Honda and stabbed me in the eyes.

“I didn’t schedule anything,” I said.

“No ma’am.” Still smiling. “You didn’t have to. It’s automatic.”

He said automatic the way people say free.

“I can come back,” he offered, instantly. No pressure. No annoyance. “If it’s not a good time. I’ve just got you slotted between the Johnsons and the Culvers. I like to stay on pace, is all.”

On pace.

He said it gently, but it landed like a rule.

My hand stayed on the doorknob. His eyes flicked down to it.

Not alarmed. Not threatened. Just… noting it.

“Won’t take but a minute,” he said again. “You’ll be doing me a kindness.”

And here’s the part I hate admitting, even now:

I wanted to be kind.

That’s the trick of polite strangers in daylight. They borrow your decency like community property.

I opened the door wider.

“Okay,” I said. “A minute.”

“Appreciate you.” He stepped inside with the easy confidence of someone entering a place that already belonged to him. His boots were clean. Not brand-new clean—worn clean. Like he took care of his tools.

He didn’t look around in a nosy way. He didn’t gawk at the family photos—the ones I kept meaning to update, the ones that still showed four of us instead of one. He didn’t comment on the unfolded laundry on the couch. He didn’t do the obvious things that would’ve set off every alarm bell I’d been pretending I had.

He just moved like he had a route.

“Detectors are usually in the hallway and bedrooms,” he said, conversational. “Do you mind if I start upstairs?”

I blinked. “Upstairs?”

“Yeah,” he said, still smiling. “The ones that matter are near where people sleep.”

I thought of the second floor—two bedrooms and an office and a bathroom with a door that didn’t latch right unless you lifted it.

I thought of how the hallway creaked between the third and fourth step.

Things you only notice when you live somewhere.

Things you forget other people can notice too.

“I can show you,” I heard myself say.

“Wonderful.” He wrote something on the clipboard without looking at it. His pen scratched softly. He nodded to himself, pleased. “Lead the way.”

He followed close, not crowding, just… there. His scent was clean detergent and cold air. The kind of smell you associate with uniforms, with routines, with people who do their jobs and go home.

The stairs creaked exactly where I expected.

Behind me, his footsteps didn’t.

He stepped over the squeaky spot without hesitation.

At the top of the stairs, sunlight poured through the hallway window and painted bright rectangles on the carpet. Dust motes drifted in it lazily, doing their little floating dance like everything was fine.

He squinted at the smoke detector above the linen closet.

“Mind if I?” he asked, already reaching up.

Before I could answer, he twisted it loose with a gentle snap and held it down in both hands like it was a newborn.

“Good model,” he said, approving. “These are reliable.”

He pressed a button. It chirped—a clean, sharp sound that made the hallway feel smaller. He didn’t flinch. Just nodded, checked a box, and snapped it back in place like he’d put it there himself.

Then he looked at me.

“You’ve got kids?” he asked.

My face tried to lie before my mouth could.

“My nephew visits,” I said. “Sometimes.”

He nodded like that fit his expectations perfectly. “Got it.”

And wrote something.

I watched his pen.

I shouldn’t have, but I couldn’t stop.

The handwriting was neat, practiced. There were already notes on the page that hadn’t been there downstairs. Short, tidy phrases.

Upstairs hall: OK.
Window: bright.
Sound: stairs.

I couldn’t tell if those last ones were old notes or new ones, and that was worse than either answer.

We moved to the office. My laptop on the desk. A charging cable coiled like a sleeping snake. A pile of mail I kept meaning to sort.

He stopped under the detector, pressed the button. Chirp.

Then his gaze dropped—briefly—to my desk.

He smiled, a touch wider.

“Busy,” he said.

“Just emails,” I said.

“Always emails.” He laughed softly, like the world was a shared joke between responsible adults.

He checked another box.

Then he did something tiny that almost slid right past me.

He nudged the office door with his foot as he stepped out.

Not closing it.

Not leaving it open.

Just… testing how it moved. How it caught. How it swung.

He turned back to me in the bright hallway like this was all normal, like he was about to compliment my paint color.

“Almost done,” he said, warmly. “You’re doing great.”

Downstairs he tested the living room detector. Checkbox. Then the kitchen.

Chirp. Checkbox.

He didn’t comment on the knife block or the back door or the fact that my phone was face-down on the counter like I’d put it there on purpose.

He just nodded, satisfied, and wrote the last note.

“All set,” he said. “You’re compliant.”

He said it like I’d earned a sticker.

He stepped onto the porch, turned back, and smiled at me from the sunlight like a man saying goodbye to a neighbor after borrowing sugar.

“Thank you, Maren,” he said.

I didn’t answer.

He didn’t seem to mind.

He tipped his cap and walked down the steps.

Then he stopped at the end of my walkway and looked back at the house.

Not at the porch. Not at me.

At the upstairs hallway window.

He raised his hand and waved.

Just once.

Then he walked on, unhurried, toward the next house.

I closed the door and locked it. Deadbolt. Chain. The cheap little latch we never used because it felt old-fashioned.

I grabbed my phone and opened the camera app.

The doorbell feed loaded.

A spinning circle. A loading bar.

Then: No Events.

I tapped refresh. Again. Again.

No Events.

Because if there was no video, then either the camera had glitched at the exact wrong time—

—or someone had turned it off.

I didn’t want to think the second thought, so I forced the first one down my throat like a pill.

I called the utility company. I didn’t know which one, so I called the first number I found.

The woman on the line sounded like a smile you could hear.

“Hi! Thanks for calling. How can I help?”

I explained, trying to keep my voice casual. Just checking. Probably nothing. Just want to verify.

Her smile stayed steady.

“Mm-hmm,” she said. “Okay. And you said a safety check?”

“Yes.”

“And you didn’t schedule it.”

“No.”

“Okay!” She clicked a keyboard. “What was the name of the representative?”

“I don’t know.”

“Not a problem. Can you describe him?”

“Orange vest. Clipboard. Hat. Clean boots. Friendly.” My voice snagged on friendly.

Another clack of keys.

“Huh,” she said, still smiling. “We don’t have any programs like that. Not in your area. Not for this month.”

The kitchen felt too bright, like it was trying to argue with me.

“Are you sure?” I asked.

“Yes ma’am,” she said, cheerful as ever. “Absolutely sure.”

I swallowed. “Could it have been the fire department?”

“That’s not something we coordinate,” she said, still sweet. “But if someone is representing themselves as a utility worker, I would recommend calling your local non-emergency line.”

She said non-emergency like she was offering a coupon.

I thanked her because I’m apparently incapable of not thanking people, even when my hands are cold.

I hung up.

The house was quiet except for the refrigerator hum and the clock tick and the faint, distant sound of that kid outside yelling “WATCH THIS!”

I went upstairs again, slow, listening to the creaks like they might say something back.

In the office, the mail was still there, waiting to be sorted like it always was.

I stood in the doorway and looked at the edge of the frame, because my eyes had started doing that now—checking seams, checking corners, checking the places where normal things touch.

And there it was.

On the inside edge of the office doorframe—so close you’d never notice unless you were looking for something to justify your fear—there was a tiny, thin strip of clear tape.

Just a small piece, barely the width of a fingernail.

Stuck between the frame and the door, positioned so the door would tear it when opened.

A little flag.

A yes-or-no question waiting to be answered.

I didn’t touch it. I just stared until my eyes watered, and then I backed away like it might bite.

Downstairs, the radio kept going, filling the rooms with chatter and ads and the illusion that noise equals safety.

I went to the front window and pulled the curtain back an inch.

The street was empty.

No kid. No bike in motion. No bright little voice.

Just a bicycle on its side in someone’s yard like it had been dropped mid-sentence.

I watched the sidewalk for a full minute, waiting for some parent to appear, waiting for laughter, waiting for someone to yell a name.

Nothing moved.

I let the curtain fall back into place.

The house held its breath with me.

And then—without any warning, without any dramatic bang or creak—the refrigerator stopped humming.

The sudden quiet was so clean it felt intentional.

I stood there, listening, trying to catch the moment it should have made a sound.

Nothing.

I walked into the kitchen.

The fridge stood the same as always. Magnet clutter. A smudge on the handle I’d never managed to scrub off.

But the plug—

The plug wasn’t in the outlet.

The cord was coiled neatly on the floor, looped like a gift ribbon, like somebody had taken their time.

I stared at it until my thoughts got thin.

Because I could picture myself doing it, couldn’t I? Unplugging it for a second to reset it, meaning to plug it back in, getting distracted by a text or a spill or a knock at the door.

It fit. It fit too well.

I picked up the cord. My fingers knew the weight of it. The rubber was cold.

I plugged it in.

The refrigerator hummed to life.

Just like that. Simple. Normal.

I stood there with my hand still on the plug, staring at the outlet like it might confess.

And the worst part—the part that settled into me like a permanent bruise—was how easily it could go either way.

How I would never know.

So recent ga ABR cinemas ki vellanu Raja Saab and Nari nari naduma murari ki. Both the times I've had the worst ever theatrical experience asala. 

So Rajasaab was watched on Screen 1, which they named ‘Neo Screen X’ for reasons only they know. On the very first day itself, there was an issue with picture calibration. In the corners, you could actually see parts of the empty screen where the picture wasn’t projected. Since it wasn’t a major issue, I let it go.


But today, I went to the same theatre to watch Nari Nari Naduma Murari, and the theatrical experience was even worse than Rajasaab. Firstly, the air conditioning wasn’t even switched on when the audience entered. I went and complained to the manager, and he said he would turn it on right away and that it would take 5–10 minutes to cool, which was fair. However, even 30 minutes into the movie, I could still feel humidity inside the screen. I complained again, and once more he asked me to wait for another five minutes. 15mins ayindi inka anthe humid ga undi but then all of a sudden ga screen blank aipoyi only Audio vastundi anthe that was the threshold point for me baytaki velli manager ni adigithe enti asala ee issues ani apudu cheptunadu AC trip aipothundi ani and screen enduku blank ayindi ante he was telling me that everybody here is new here so it would take a week for them to understand everything ani.

But the issues did not stop there. This mall had problems right from the construction stage itself. You might wonder why this mall took so long to open in the first place. Here’s a bit of backstory on what happened.
I spoke to the site supervisor during the construction phase. The mall was developed by the Sentini Group, the same group that runs hospitals. This was their first time entering this field, and they had little to no experience. Initially, they faced financial hurdles, and later the mall did not take shape as they had envisioned.
The ground floor, where Harley’s Fine Baking is currently located, was originally planned to be a gaming arena. However, when the Sentini Group realized that the project was not turning out as expected, they changed the entire plan. The first and second floors were converted into a Kalyana Mandapam, and a stake in the project was sold to another party in order to get the construction completed.

I had visited the mall during the construction phase itself. At that time, the ground floor was supposed to have a gaming arena and Cafe Coffee Day. The first floor was planned to include Subway, Cream Stone, and a few clothing franchises, while the second floor was meant to be an entire food court.
The initial theatre chain that was supposed to be part of the mall was PVR Cinemas, and they had planned a three-screen multiplex. However, these greedy fucks insisted that they would only enter into an agreement if it was a four-screen setup. Given the limited space in the mall four screens was not feasible, so PVR had backed out. Later, they brought in local player ABR Cinemas. I don’t know how their cinemas are at other locations, but this has to be one of the absolute worst screens to watch a movie in.",1,1768420802.0,vijayawada,0,0.99,False

We spoke about our childhood, life experiences, society in general, relationships… the kind of conversations that don’t feel forced, they just flow.
Then came the tiramisu which gave bhayankar sugar crash 😵‍💫

He told me, “You’re the most good-looking person I’ve ever seen.”

I immediately rejected this statement because I have seen mirrors, photos, and my front camera...

But then he clarified “Not looks. Charm.Presence.” and i am ehh 
Because it honestly sounds like fake LinkedIn energy.

I brushed it off because I don’t think of myself that way at all. I’m not charismatic. I don’t wake up and go, “Time to be cherished” I mostly just exist and hope I don’t say something weird...

But then he started listing things that I had always assumed were people just being nice.
Like: Random cafés or places giving me free food
Staff being unreasonably nice and accommodating 
Strangers oversharing their trauma within minutes of meeting me
Then he brought up something that was just awkward...

There have been multiple times where people  have just… done my work for me??
Like full-on writing my lab manual, even though they explicitly refuse to do work for anyone else.
I didn’t beg. I didn’t manipulate. I asked once. Politely.
And suddenly my academic responsibilities were handled by someone else like I had unlocked a side quest reward.
Other random things:
Someone Offering to cook me homemade food or coffee ....( I just look tired since I didn’t sleep a lot which made me more self conscious that perhaps I look pityful)

Being told “I normally don’t do this for anyone” more times than statistically makes sense
Again I thought this was normal?? Like maybe people are just kind?? Or maybe they feel bad for me??

Then later that same day, my friend and I went to Pizza Hut.
The girl working there was extremely friendly with me. Smiling, joking, sharing personal details, low-key flirty energy.
She then turns to my friend and instantly goes ”for this friend? ""
I witnessed my friend giving me the look as if he's bloody won our debate
Now I’m spiraling.

Is “charm” actually a real thing? Not just on paper especially for someone socially inept

Is this subconscious body language / tone / confidence stuff?

Or am I just accidentally exploiting customer service workers and classmates???

I purchased a 7-day itinerary out of Galveston on Regal for 250 bucks out the door including port fees and taxes. Of course I brought my husband which was another 250. 

I believe there was about 3700 or 3900 passengers and usually I think that holds about 4,000. It was a good number We never had trouble finding lounge chairs or seating in the buffet.

I got this amazing deal through a travel agent, I hope I'm allowed to tell the name of it ---it was Prestige cruises. 

I believe I bought it in mid October for a January sailing.

I did not buy either Premium or Plus package because I'm not much of a drinker. Also because Verizon offers a cruise ship package for only 17 a day which worked great and I didn't want it every single day, just some days (mostly the two to three sea days because Verizon also gives you free travel passes for countries outside of North America, inside of North America, including Mexico, your regular plan covers you). 

We also purchased sanctuary lounge access one half day (20 each/40 total). We bought a few things in the gift shop and my husband is a moderate drinker. In total we spent another 500 (40/day) per our Folio. 

One interesting thing about the drinks package/alcohol on board: I've previously been on MSC ship and when we brought alcohol back from Bahamas onto the ship nobody said anything. They're supposed to check it I guess, to make sure that they're extracting your money from you when you're buying your drinks , but msc didn't, At least on this one occasion.

We were wondering if Princess would be the same. When we went through the scanner getting back on, a woman said ""you have alcohol in here, be sure to see the table inside to get it checked.""  When we got to the table inside someone was barfing next to it and the employee  was helping them and I think using an iPad to call for more help so we didn't wait. I don't want noro and the alcohol was for someone else anyway, not for us. Even if that hadn't happened it would have been easy to walk past with our alcohol because the two employees weren't near each other. It was on us to follow the directions to have our alcohol checked.

#AUTOGRATUITY CONTROVERSY
AKA here come my downvotes?

We tipped cash all week and removed auto grats. Now we are by no means lacking in money. I don't even work myself as my husband makes plenty. But, I'm not a big fan of corporate greed and paying workers low wages. I also worked as a server and bartender for a lot of my young life.

We removed autograts because a bartender that we got to know who spoke my husband's main language confirmed that their contractual pay doesn't increase nor decrease based on auto grats. So the conclusion here is that auto gratuities go directly into corporate profit and pockets. It's just a way for them to be able to advertise low prices but to guilt you into paying more. 

We were eventually able to get our room steward to sort of verify this in a roundabout day on the second to last day in our cabin. So this is across the board front of house and back of house policy. (Ps The room steward was much more reticent to speak openly. They're probably really not supposed to talk about money at all.)

We removed the auto gratuities simply by using the app to text guest services. It was simple, they said okay and it was gone the next day.

I also think that classifying auto gratuity as gratuity allows the corporation to get around some taxes payments perhaps? Or some kind of fees structures or I don't know, something like that. Not count it as profit?

We tipped our room steward 75 and our dining room guys 50 and 25 for the junior guy. To be fair the junior guy was not good with bringing drinks well maybe he was just super busy.

#EMBARKATION AND TECH
The medallion is such great tech! We got ours sent to us ahead and we're glad because we got to the port at around noon and the line was out the door. As you got to the door, you were sorted between those who had the medallion already and those who didn't. 

The line was EASILY five times longer for non-medallions. You know how they use the barrier belts/stanchions and you wind through it? We had ONE wind/turn. It was 15 minutes. They easily had TEN weaves to go thru. Also there was a third, a disability one that had about 10 people at all times. 

All 3 lines were being directed to the same bank of about 10 people checking your info (passport and bags). Then you entered another room where there was a desk to get your medallion OR you skipped that. We skipped to the back and there was one more thing back there to do although I forget what it was but it was like 2 minutes. Then we got on. Total about 20 minutes.

#PORTS
Took a cab to a beach resort in Cozumel. We are late risers so there was no wait but there was a stanchion system in place that was empty. 

When we got back we chose to shop on the street instead of entering the fence port area and shopping in those places. That might have been a mistake for some people. Because it was a bit of that hard sell where they beg you to come in and they ask you too many personal questions and they bring you stuff when you just want to shop in peace and quiet. 

Inside the port area it wasn't like that at all and they left you alone. 

We've traveled a lot worldwide so we were accustomed to that plus we both speak Spanish pretty well.

In Roatan, we docked at the same time as the Sun Princess. Both ships had people going to the monkey sanctuary. But it was one meeting spot. Two people checking in and no indication which was which. And also we didn't know that half of the people were from another cruise ship. So we get in the slightly shorter line. And wait. But when we get up there the guy says sorry I'm only doing sun princess check-in. And again, this wasn't obvious at all there is no signage that indicated Sun versus Regal. 

Well that sucked except he said just go to that woman. He didn't say to get in the other line. So we just crowd around the woman. And there was a little crowd around her but there was also a line in front of her. But he said just to go to her and she checked us in without having to stand in line. 

But the opposite thing happened where Sun Princess woman was in the Regal  line. And when she was told to go to the other guy, she had a problem with that and got a little loud and mad because she thought she would have to stand in the other line. 

It was kind of dumb because the line was just to get a fluorescent green bracelet and the bracelets were the same no matter what ship you were on. Although I guess maybe she checked people off using medallion technology, I'm not sure. 

Then we stood around a little while more and then They walked us as a big glob of a crowd to an area where they started loading up mini buses / shuttles. 

Let me give you some warning. Shuttles/vans / mini buses im other countried can be very small. A large woman got on a little after us and she had so much trouble squeezing through the aisle. It was so narrow. I mean it was narrow for me and I'm not big at all. She was actually going to turn around and get off. She was convinced she couldn't make it. But she did. Just a heads up. The seats were small too so I imagine it was an uncomfortable ride for many people.

Monkey sanctuary was definitely worth it. And our other excursion was also a princess excursion in Belize, the river cruise and we saw so much wildlife it was totally worth it and well done and well organized. 

One thing though. The boats on the river cruise have a tarp covering them BUT the front 5 rows don't have it. And I saw a woman who didn't want to sit in the sun, she was very nordic looking so I don't blame her. And then as later passengers got on people wanted her to slide up instead of the later passengers climbing over to get to the front and she refused and I don't blame her. 

The Cruise person said something about ""don't worry we're going to turn around and you won't always have the sun right on you""  but that wasn't true because we turned around a lot on the whole trip so the people not under the tarp got sun on them a lot a lot. And yeah there's sunscreen but pale people preferring the tarp isn't outlandish at all. And she was smart cuz it was a two-hour trip with lots of sun.

#FOOD
So much of it and it was good there were maybe two meals in the formal dining room that were bragworthy and the rest of it was just fine. 

I really liked our server in the main dining room and I was sure to tip him very well. I just liked him a lot, he was always in a positive mood and attentive.

There is soft serve ice cream on the lido and sometimes there are sundae toppings that make it much more worth it. 

In the evenings there's often little bags of popcorn there. When we thought of it we grabbed one before we went to our evening entertainment.

Oh this is opposite of MSC. On Regal the buffet started closing at like 930 and was almost totally closed by 10:00 p.m. We saw people walk in about then looking confused and hungry. 

Now in the Piazza or plaza or whatever it's called there is the international Cafe where you can get a quiche heated up or a bunch of different sandwiches and cakes and I believe it's 24/7. The problem with it is they always seem to have only one or two workers there after 10:00 and there was always a long line and the workers just didn't seem to be in much of a hurry despite the line. 

But I tell you what the sandwiches were better there than in the buffet I think. I had a walnut and Bree sandwich that was amazing several times.

#ENTERTAINMENT
Like I said, we purchased the Sanctuary. The day and afternoon that we wanted it was almost full up even though it was pretty much the first thing we did when we embarked was to go make a reservation. The guy was apologetic because there was ""only a double lounger"" left. I guess some people might complain about that but it was fine for me and my husband because we like to cuddle. 

I like the sanctuary. I like the dedicated servers and the dedicated softly upscale menu they will bring you bento box and really yummy shrimp cocktails all the time. And then they bring around a cart with afternoon tea selections AND COFFEE so that was pretty cool. Not sure I would pay for a whole day though. There was just enough to do otherwise. 

The musical we watched was amazing. Oh by the way the look on people's faces of absolute confusion when they come in 5 to 10 minutes before the show and they see there's no chairs !!!!! I saw a woman actually look at her watch and then look around completely confounded. So just be aware to get in there more than 10 minutes early.

Silent disco was fun and we saw both comedians and they were great.

Now Let's talk about games and groupies because it caused drama on our cruise.

So by the second night I noticed that for games and activities where either of the cruise directors were going to be, the same people showed up. And I figured out that they were pretty much just showing up at whatever those two guys were at. 

By day four I realized what happens is the cruise directors kind of like recognize these people and so they tend to choose them to participate in the games. It's like you had to be front and center to get chosen for some of the games. So that combination meant that the same people were chosen for stuff and I thought that was kind of not cool but I'm an introvert and didn't care myself. 

HOWEVER My husband was on the Facebook group for our cruise and it turned out people did care and did complain and called them ""groupies"" lol and he read me one of the posts and apparently it caused drama on the cruise.

#KIDS
We already raised our kids and I love my toddler nephews but I just think there's places children don't belong. Like racy comedy. I don't want to hear about women ""squirting"" when I'm sitting next to a 12-year-old boy. And I don't want to hear a toddler screeching when I'm trying to enjoy my food in the main dining room. We sat in those booth/ banks so we could sit alone and not sit at a table, again I'm an introvert, But they seem to be really close to each other like I could hear conversation on both sides of me and so a toddler screaming was basically screaming directly into my ear. I think this couple called/texted the lounge babysitters because EVENTUALLY two women in uniforms came and took the child for them. 

I also don't think kids belong in hot tubs because you're supposed to sit in a hot tub not splash around and get disgusting hot tub water in my drink. Plus they just take up a lot of space when the hot tubs are almost always you know pretty full. 

Regal had an adults only area with a pool and two hot tubs so that was cool. 

One other place I don't think a kid belongs was during the crew q&A in Princess live where somehow this baby/toddler managed to yell on every other word so I couldn't hear full answers. I don't know I think the first time your kid yells fine , second time maybe fine. But the third time? It's time to take your kid out.

#DISEMBARK
This is mostly for cruise newbies. Just be aware of packing the night before. On MSC you don't have a choice-- you have to put the majority of your luggage out into the hall the night before. On Regal the deadline was by 8:00 p.m. And most people are going pretty directly to an airport. So you have to be careful with packing. You need to keep aside things that you need for the night and shower in the morning etc. But also you have to pack so that your liquids go in your checked bag If you are flying. But that main bag is the one that you're supposed to leave in the hallway for them to take off the ship for you. 

So just be aware of packing the night before. Princess does give you the choice of not putting your bags out and then just taking them off yourself. 

BUT also be aware that you have to be out of your room by a certain time. Princess said 8:00 a.m. But you don't necessarily get to just walk off the ship at 8:00 a.m. So there were a lot of people in public areas and the buffet  with mass amounts of luggage trying to navigate through and they were miserable. 

So if you keep your luggage you might be responsible for schlepping your luggage for almost 2 hours before you can actually get off.

Would I cruise Princess again? Yes I loved getting to see three ports for such a small amount of money. But I'm not like super loyal to them or MSC or any one place. 

So $500 for the initial cruise, 500 for the folio total both of us, and our flights were about 500. Was not a bad vacation at all I really liked being alone with my husband and without our phones 24/7 for a week. Two thumbs up.

XX 2019 CE: I want an espresso machine. I can’t afford one. So I buy a Bialetti moka pot instead. It feels honest. Mechanical. Patient.
I start reading about beans. Origins. Estates. I try many. I fail often. I settle on a few that feel right. The moka pot stays. It always does.

Circa 2019-2015 CE: Mornings stack up. Life rises and falls. The moka pot shows up every day, like a dependable friend who doesn’t ask questions. I drink coffee while figuring things out. Or avoiding them. Same thing, really.

The ritual continues.

XX Aug, 2025 CE: I read about cinnamon lattes. Sounds like folklore. I try it anyway.
One pinch. Freshly ground cinnamon.
Something clicks.
Eureka. Not the shouting kind. The quiet, internal kind.

15th Jan, 2026 CE: Now the cinnamon goes straight into the grind. Every morning. No debate. No second thoughts.
I want to tell someone. Anyone. Problem is, everyone around me drinks chai.

He told me, “You’re the most good-looking person I’ve ever seen.”

I immediately rejected this statement because I have seen mirrors, photos, and my front camera...

But then he clarified “Not looks. Charm.Presence.” and i am ehh 
Because it honestly sounds like fake LinkedIn energy.

I brushed it off because I don’t think of myself that way at all. I’m not charismatic. I don’t wake up and go, “Time to be cherished” I mostly just exist and hope I don’t say something weird...

But then he started listing things that I had always assumed were people just being nice.
Like: Random cafés or places giving me free food
Staff being unreasonably nice and accommodating 
Strangers oversharing their trauma within minutes of meeting me
Then he brought up something that was just awkward...

There have been multiple times where people  have just… done my work for me??
Like full-on writing my lab manual, even though they explicitly refuse to do work for anyone else.
I didn’t beg. I didn’t manipulate. I asked once. Politely.
And suddenly my academic responsibilities were handled by someone else like I had unlocked a side quest reward.
Other random things:
Someone Offering to cook me homemade food or coffee ....( I just look tired since I didn’t sleep a lot which made me more self conscious that perhaps I look pityful)

Being told “I normally don’t do this for anyone” more times than statistically makes sense
Again I thought this was normal?? Like maybe people are just kind?? Or maybe they feel bad for me??

Then later that same day, my friend and I went to Pizza Hut.
The girl working there was extremely friendly with me. Smiling, joking, sharing personal details, low-key flirty energy.
She then turns to my friend and instantly goes: “bhaiya.”
I witnessed my friend giving me the look as if he's bloody won our debate
Now I’m spiraling.

Is “charm” actually a real thing? Not just on paper especially for someone socially inept

Is this subconscious body language / tone / confidence stuff?

Or am I just accidentally exploiting customer service workers and classmates???

Link: [https://youtu.be/ihYMEEgomTk](https://youtu.be/ihYMEEgomTk)

The story begins in 9th century Ethiopia with a goat herder named Kaldi, whose goats became inexplicably energetic after eating certain berries. This simple observation would eventually lead to a molecule that now sustains 2 billion cups of coffee consumed every single day.

But the real story is what happens in your brain.

The Neuroscience:

•Throughout the day, your brain produces adenosine as a byproduct of energy use

•Adenosine binds to receptors and makes you feel progressively more tired

•Caffeine is structurally similar to adenosine—so similar it fits perfectly into adenosine receptors

•But instead of activating them, caffeine blocks them

•Your brain thinks there's less adenosine than there actually is, so you feel awake

•It's not that you're more rested—you're just blocking the signal that tells you you're tired

The Consequence:

•Your brain responds to chronic caffeine use by creating more adenosine receptors (tolerance)

•You need more caffeine just to feel normal

•Stop drinking coffee? Adenosine floods in like water through a broken dam

•The result: pounding headaches, crushing fatigue, irritability—withdrawal peaks at 24-48 hours

The video covers all of this with animations, plus the fascinating history of how caffeine fueled the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution.

Hi…?



It’s going. How about you?



Cool. Good. 



(*Sarcastic*) Taking in the local scenery. I’m here to attend the HOA meeting, same as you. 



Right, someone did just move in next door. Welcome to the building then. 



I like it here well enough. For a decent price, I’ve got a roof over my head, a reserved parking spot, and only two roommates. It could be worse. 



They’re fine. Well, they’re fine when they’re not signing me up to attend stupid meetings at ass o’clock in the morning. 



\[You groan.\]



(*Sharp*) The same things you can do in every town. You have Google, don’t you? 



\[There’s an awkward pause. You take a couple deep breaths and sigh before pausing again.\]



(*Tentative, a little ashamed*) There’s a bar about three blocks from here that does trivia tournaments. 



That’s a fun thing to do around here, fun to me anyway. My friends and I went there last night and played on opposite teams. Sometimes we decide to make it harder and more interesting by making the other team drink every time they get a question right. Unfortunately, I’m really good at trivia and really competitive which means I got really drunk and am really, violently hungover. 



Yeah, that’s why I’m being really rude. Sorry about that. 



(*Warming up/softening*) Depends who you ask. 



Sure. Ask the head of the HOA and why we’re here, she’d say yes. But also, she’s the devil, so I treat her accordingly. Ask my roommates, they’ll… Well, they’ll say I’m pretty rude but that they put up with it because I pay rent on time and make extra food to share. On better days and at more reasonable hours, I have redeeming qualities, I swear. 



Scout’s honor. What was your name again?



I’m \[Name\]. It’s nice to meet you. 



You’re new to town. You moved for work?



Educated guess. Nowadays, who really has time other than to work and survive?



Right, and you’re using the little free time you do have to… attend an HOA meeting? Are the inner workings and politics of our apartment building that interesting?



(*Low, conspiratorial*) I hate to break it to you, but this is a terrible way to meet people, especially friends. Everyone here is either a Karen, forced to be here, or weirdly and irritatingly particular about extra funds being allotted for gym equipment. 



Her? Is that who invited you here?



That’s the devil. That’s Karen. 



I’m not- Well, I’m being a little mean but not wrong. Her name is literally Karen, and she’s the worst. She seems really nice, but once she sizes you up, she’ll get on your ass about fucking everything. Don’t pick up your mail for two days? Karen’s at your door. Too many amazon packages coming through? There’s Karen. Your car’s dirty? Be prepared for a passive aggressive note from Karen about putting our best food- or tire- forward. 



Also? Her dog sucks. It’s not the dog’s fault it sucks, but that is, in fact, a bad dog.



Wrong. I love dogs, and I’d love Cupcake if her owner taught her how to not be a monster. Karen will talk you into dogsitting for free the next time her and her husband take a little trip to Turks and Caicos and then won’t reimburse you when her unhousetrained brat breaks your playstation.



How do you think I know?



Too long. 



\[You chuckle.\]



Long enough. A while. My roommates have lived here longer though. Robin grew up here; that’s why they’re so intent on making sure at least one of us shows up to these goddamn things.



Hate it. The fluorescents in here are making me want to either puke or start a fight, whichever one will put me out of my misery faster. 



Because they’re just as hungover, and I made the stupid mistake of owing them a favor.



You know what? I don’t actually know. Let me see; they texted me about it on the way out. I’m supposed to… “make sure Bobby doesn’t get voted in as Treasurer; that schmuck doesn’t know how to do math.” Hmm.



I don’t know other than just not voting for the guy. If they expect me to go around whispering and sowing discourse or some shit, they’ve got another thing coming. 



Hey. Don’t vote for Bobby, okay? 



There we go. I’ve done exactly when I’ve been asked; I made an effort to make sure he doesn’t get elected. Shake on it. 



I think so. It’s all very “Conclave” and definitely feels like a lot, but unless we want half the parking lot demolished for a pickleball court we don’t need, it’s probably best to do what we have to do. When in Rome, I guess. 



You haven’t seen Conclave? It’s pretty good; it’s about cardinals voting for the next Pope, so it’s a fuck ton of whispering, gossip, alliances, the whole nine yards.



\[You pause.\]



(*Tentative*) What are you doing after this? 



You should come on over. Taylor, our other roommate, is really big on physical media and owning the stuff you buy, so we have it on Blu-ray. It’s our day off, and we don’t have any other plans other than to hang out, so it’d be really chill. 



(*Playful, warm*) I don’t pity you; I feel bad I acted like a dick; that’s very different. Plus, if Robin and Taylor know I made a bad first impression and reflected poorly on them, they might kick me out… or make me attend these for the rest of the year which would be worse.  



Really, you should come by. I’ll make lunch, you can meet the nicer members of our house, and I’ll be a more decent, almost likable person after I get some good coffee in me. I’ll even share the good coffee with you. 



I don’t call it being a snob; I call it not wanting to drink swamp water no matter how caffeinated. I-



(*Aside, rude*) Hi, Karen. 



I don’t know; who’s up for Treasurer? 



Those three options, no contest, I’ll vote for Linda. 



Because I know Linda knows how to manage a damn book. Linda doesn’t owe me money-!

My wife has likely had feelings for her coworker ever since she started her newest job over 3 years ago. She would bring him up in stories, message with him (daily?), and tell me the funny things he does. The interactions have gone down since they're not in the same dept anymore, but they still meet up for coffee on campus and go on walks around the grounds. They do this at least once a week. I've seen her play-hit him at least twice at social functions. I do not think she's slept with him *yet*, though who knows how little it would take for that to happen.

In my reading of the situation, I see the signs of the *beginning* stages of an emotional affair but I haven't yet experienced the later stages. She doesn't hide her phone and typically leaves it in plain sight. She doesn't disappear for hours at a time or ignore my messages. She doesn't take questionable weekend trips or go get drinks with colleagues after work. In the time they've known each other the co-worker has gotten engaged and married his long-time gf. Regardless, I'm sure she gets the tingles from him.

I read every MRP piece of content I could find on emotional affairs and what (not) to do. What I took away was that there was no point in bringing it up to her. I can't change her actions or her feelings. And if I did bring it up she'd probably just hide it better, and I'd come across needy and insecure.

The best thing might've been to take Apex Mindset Paul's advice and at the very beginning of this make clear my expectations and boundaries, but that time has long passed. I can only focus on making myself better and hope for the best. I do have a long way to go in making myself more attractive and desirable. I don't blame her for being attracted to this guy. I accept that I could've done things better but also acknowledge she isn't mine it's just (at the moment) my turn.

That said, I'm not asking what I can do to stop it or change her, **I'm asking what to say or do in case it comes up in conversation**. I'm afraid one day I'm going to accidentally show my cards and she'll ask me if I have a problem with him or them hanging out or if I'm jealous, etc. She might be telling me another hilarious anecdote he told her at lunch and she'll notice my eyes glazing over and question me. I don't want to fumble this or blow it up. I feel like I've already come close a few times.

So what to do?

It seems obvious that I shouldn't victim puke to her and dump all my insecurities.

Lying about how I feel and acting like I'm fine with everything also seems like the wrong choice.

I'm not really in a position to enforce a crossed boundary considering her SMV is still way above mine and any superior ""provider"" qualities I once had have been eliminated by her overtaking me in income and job status. And admittedly my Oneitis too.

I'm not going to end my marriage just because she ""probably"" has feelings and that she ""might"" sleep with him in the future. If she ever does cheat, I'll leave, but for me the early stages of an emotional affair isn't enough to divorce.

Sounds like he'll soon be returning to her department for a few months, so the interactions are only going to increase. Any insight is appreciated.",1,1768419858.0,askMRP,2,1.0,False

**Vintage shows**:

**The Curio Collective Halifax Vintage Show** (several times a year): This show brings together a carefully curated mix of vintage vendors under one roof. You'll find clothing, decor, dishware, and paper goods displayed across beautifully arranged tables and booths. The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming. Most vendors accept tap or card, but it's a good idea to have some cash on you. Also, many shows feature a coffee bar or snack station. 

**Location**: Light House Arts Centre

**The Funky Flea: Halifax** (weekly from March to October): This old-school flea market brings together 100 to 150 vintage vendors, creating the feel of a giant antiques collection. You'll find collectible cards, sports memorabilia, teacups, curiosities, and more. There's a coffee and homemade baked goods stand on-site. Most vendors accept tap or card, but it's a good idea to have some cash on hand.

**Location**: The Exhibition Centre

South End Vintage Markets (monthly): 40 vendors with their own booth or space to showcase unique finds. Shoppers can browse clothing, shoes, antiques, vintage frames, and more. Entry is $2, and kids get in for free.

**Location**: Dalhousie Student Union Building

**Vintage shops**:

**Esmé & Evee Vintage & Preloved** (Agricola Street): A sunlit shop that sits next door to the secondhand bookstore Agricola Street Books. The focus is primarily on clothing, with neatly organized racks that make it easy to browse jeans, jackets, dresses and more. There's even a small selection of bags and curated shoes.

**Halifax Vintage Co-Op** (Agricola Street): Spread over two floors, this is a collaborative vintage and antique shop featuring more than 20 of Nova Scotia's top vintage vendors who regularly bring in new finds. Most of the housewares and antiques are displayed on the main level, while the upper floor is filled with racks of curated vintage clothing.

**KingsPIER Vintage** (Barrington Street): Located in a historic downtown building. The first room features accessories, wallets, bags, shoes, and shirts, including an entire wall dedicated to shoes and boots. Upstairs, you'll find jeans, wool coats, furs, and luxury name-brand vintage pieces.

**The Loot Vintage** (Barrington Street): A blue-painted shop that's spread over two levels, offering a curated mix of men's and women's clothing, blending vintage finds and carefully chosen consignment pieces. You'll find clothing, select bags, shoes, and accessories.

**Old Times Old Friends Antiques Collectables & Dolls** (Eastern Shore): Find centuries-old furniture, antique dolls, estate costume jewellery, vintage teapots and plate sets, and curios from around the world. From floor to ceiling, the shelves overflow with treasures that the owner, Margaret, has lovingly collected over decades.

**The ReFound Shop** (Thistle Street, Dartmouth): A one-room space with high-quality vintage pieces. Despite its size, it offers an impressive selection of housewares, dishware, and collectibles, all thoughtfully curated. Each year, the shop hosts a popular Christmas sale, featuring vintage ceramic Christmas trees, and it often carries vintage Fisher-Price items for kids.

**Threadz Thrift Shop** (Main Street, Dartmouth): A single-floor thrift shop specializing in vintage and retro fashion for men and women, though they do have newer pieces as well. The space's black walls make the colourful clothing stand out. Their well-organized racks make it easy to discover clothing and outerwear. On the back wall, shelves display shoes and accessories at great prices.

**The Vintage Mansion** (South Park Street): Each room of this two-story Victorian home features a different vendor, offering clothing and home decor. The shop is part of one of Halifax's oldest homes.",1,1768419674.0,DiscoverHalifax,0,1.0,False

If I tell her, I know she will not leave him—she will endure anything. But I do know that she will distance herself from me if she feels threatened by me because of what he did.

The thing is, I don’t know how to be friends with her with him always there or ever have a normal relationship with them again. Her husband told me he was sorry and that what he did was stupid and that he doesn’t want to ruin his life. But he sent me and said some really crude things that are hard to forget. Drunk or not, it really crossed the line.

I met with my friend over coffee and I was ready to walk away for both our sakes, but I love her so much and I don’t want to lose her. I just don’t know how to maintain a healthy friendship when I don’t trust her husband. Am I overreacting if I end it?

ETA: I did tell her a line was crossed on a night he was drinking (but he followed up the next day). She told me that she didn’t want to hear it and that if something happened, that’s a “him” problem and she needed to hear it from him. She shut me down and distanced for a year. We recently reconnected over coffee after a hard year and it went great. I really missed her.

She doesn’t know that he texted me again two weeks ago. It’s been a relationship on edge because I told her the first time and she just didn’t want to talk about it. So now idk what to do…because he wasn’t as sorry as he said he was and did the same thing again (while drunk).",23,1768419545.0,AmIOverreacting,37,0.96,False

No bare minimum mentality.  I don’t want to hear shit about a 50/50. This plot requires a man who wants to help a woman feel like royalty. 

What’s up, I’m a 24 y old F, I’m looking forward to making a reality with an athletic husband. Specifically a football player. I’ve been enjoying  a lot of post of football players ‘micced’ up online recently. I didn’t expect to see a side of any football players that could be playful, and boyish. But to my surprise, there is PLENTY OF THAT. And I FIND THAT VERY ATTRACTIVE. The ability to keep up, train hard, but still have a personality outside of “BALL!” & “TACKLE” 

Yes. Sign me up. 

With that being said, I want to roleplay  between two characters who either A:

Meet each other online: 

My character has a low follower account compared to yours but he spots her somehow some way, whether she is beneath the comments of a video that’s posted on a mutually followed page. Or whether he finds her through a friend of a friends page. From there, they message one another and agree to meet. 

Or B: She is already on the scene. She plays the role of some form of medic, or even a sports massage therapist. He’s encountered her on duty. And maybe your character begins to see a few stars during a game, and he’s half concussed and sees her as some form of angel who was sent into his life, and he just HASS TO GO OUT ON A DATE WITH HER.  Doesn’t have to be dramatic, but let’s prevent it from being boring. 

C. My character works at a coffee shop and boom, they meet. Your character could be an amateur, or a pro. But my character won’t know that you’re an athlete until after date 1. 

Honorable mentions for the plot: roses, helicopter rides, fast cars, fine dining, n s f w scenes, romance, and cute bonding moments, awkwardness, caretaking (mutual)

I am 5'2"" and 175 lbs. 

I did paleo once before when I was 22-24 and it worked wonders for me. My skin cleared up. I lost a lot of weight. I had more energy and my bowels improved. 

My positive experience last time is what led me to try it again this time. The last time I was paleo I still ate peanut butter and green beans and hummus and such. I avoided dairy entirely. This time around I am doing a lot of the same things but a little different. So I am eating hummus (only some), green beans, things like that. This time around I actually am avoiding peanuts and I am not entirely avoiding dairy but only because when I was 22 I could drink my coffee black no problem, and now I need a bit of cream to reduce the acidity. 

If anything, I feel like I am being more strict this go around and I am seeing no weight loss. I am front-loading all of my meals with lots of protein. I limit hummus and am avoiding nuts as a snack due to high calories. I am not drinking alcohol (I was when I was younger -- ahh to be younger) and the only cheat days I've had were like Christmas and New Years Eve and even then it was one meal in the day. 

My question I guess is, is this typical? Do I REALLY have to count calories if I want to lose weight? This panics me because I don't want to live my life like that and when I have in the past it leads to a lot of mental health issues. Also, I feel like I am not eating enough in the day to day to warrant this. I don't know if it's hormones or age or what. 

This is a typical day for me:

Morning protein shake consisting of 1 cup almond milk, whey protein powder, and frozen kale and berries. This normally gets me through until lunch but if I am more hungry I will eat some eggs or have a Chomp.

At lunch I eat a bunch of grilled chicken. Maybe 5-6 ounces or more. I eat lots of raw veggies or chia pudding. For dinner I'll have like roasted sweet potato wedges, salmon or chicken or steak, and another veggie maybe like asparagus. I do have a bit of a sweet tooth (I am working on it) so typically after dinner I might have a bit more chia pudding with some honey or I also have some dark chocolate squares I eat. Oh and if I need a snack I normally have fruit like an apple or banana or something. I also love dried mango but again I try and limit that.

Anyway I am feeling really discouraged and don't know what to do. I feel like I see things online of people making changes and then immediately losing weight. Even still, I feel like a month in I should see something?? I'm just never sure how long to stick to something before I can tell it's not working and pivot. ",2,1768419354.0,Paleo,2,1.0,False

1qcwvvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1qcwvvi/how_to_use_the_pratfall_effect_to_become/,How to use the pratfall effect to become instantly more likeable (science-based psychology that actually works),"been studying social psychology and charisma for years now (books, research papers, hours of podcast content) and this one concept keeps coming up across different sources. the pratfall effect. sounds academic but it's stupidly simple and genuinely works.

here's the thing: we're all trying so hard to appear flawless. perfect instagram life, never admitting mistakes, hiding our weaknesses like they're state secrets. but research shows this backfires completely. people who occasionally mess up or show vulnerability are perceived as MORE attractive and trustworthy, not less.

Harvard psychologist Elliot Aronson discovered this in 1966 through a brilliant experiment. he had participants listen to recordings of quiz show contestants. some contestants were high performers who spilled coffee during the interview. others were equally smart but didn't spill anything. the result? the competent person who made a clumsy mistake was rated significantly more likeable than the ""perfect"" one.

this isn't just some dusty old study either. modern neuroscience backs it up. our brains are wired to be suspicious of perfection because it signals deception or unattainability. when someone shows a flaw, it triggers trust mechanisms in our prefrontal cortex. we relax around them because they seem real.

**the key is strategic imperfection**

this doesn't mean become a walking disaster. the pratfall effect only works when you're already demonstrating competence. if you're incompetent AND mess up, you just look incompetent. but when you're clearly capable and then show a minor flaw? that's the sweet spot.

practical ways to use this: admit when you don't know something instead of bullshitting. tell the slightly embarrassing story about yourself. acknowledge the mistake you made at work before anyone else points it out. share the unflattering photo. let people see you're human.

i started doing this in meetings and social situations. instead of pretending i had all the answers, i'd say ""honestly i'm not sure about that part"" or ""yeah i completely fumbled that presentation last month."" the shift in how people responded was immediate. more warmth, more openness, more trust.

**Robert Cialdini talks about this extensively in ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion""** (the guy's basically the godfather of persuasion science, taught at Stanford for decades). he dedicates a whole section to how acknowledging weaknesses BEFORE presenting strengths makes your entire message more credible. won a ton of awards and it's genuinely one of those books that changes how you see every interaction. he breaks down why admitting a small flaw first (like ""our product is expensive BUT here's why"") dramatically increases persuasion compared to only highlighting positives. this is the best book on human behavior i've ever read, genuinely made me question everything i thought i knew about influence and likability.

**Brené Brown's work on vulnerability is essential here too.** her book ""Daring Greatly"" explores how vulnerability isn't weakness but actually the birthplace of connection, innovation and change. she's a research professor who spent decades studying shame and courage. the core insight: people connect with our struggles, not our highlight reel. when you share something real, you give others permission to do the same. she's got a great podcast called ""Unlocking Us"" where she interviews people about their most human moments. insanely good listen if you want to understand why perfect facades kill relationships.

**BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app** that's worth checking out if you want to dive deeper into psychology concepts like this. Built by Columbia grads and AI experts from Google, it pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content based on what you actually want to learn. 

Type in something like ""improve social skills"" or ""become more charismatic,"" and it generates a custom podcast and adaptive learning plan tailored to your goals. You control the depth too, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. Plus there's a virtual coach you can chat with about your specific struggles, and it'll recommend content that fits. Makes it way easier to absorb this stuff during commutes or workouts instead of doomscrolling.

**for practicing this in real time, the app Ash is surprisingly helpful.** it's basically an AI relationship and communication coach. you can role play difficult conversations where you need to show vulnerability or admit mistakes. sounds weird but it actually helps you get comfortable with strategic imperfection before trying it in real situations. lets you practice the exact phrasing and tone without stakes.

couple important caveats though. context matters massively. don't use the pratfall effect in situations where competence is literally the only thing that matters (job interviews for positions requiring perfection, critical medical decisions, etc). and the flaw needs to be minor and ideally endearing. spilling coffee? charming. racist comment? not gonna help your likability.

also this only works when the mistake is genuine or at least perceived as such. if people sense you're manufacturing flaws to seem relatable, it backfires hard. that's why influencers who stage ""candid"" messy moments often get roasted. we can smell fake vulnerability from a mile away.

the deeper principle here is about managing status and relatability simultaneously. you need both. too much status (perfection, no flaws) and you seem cold or fake. too little status (constant mistakes, no competence) and you seem unreliable. the pratfall effect lets you maintain high status while adding warmth.

**this also connects to self disclosure research.** Arthur Aron did famous studies on interpersonal closeness (the ""36 questions to fall in love"" stuff). deeper self disclosure creates faster bonding, but it has to be reciprocal and gradually escalating. you can't trauma dump on someone immediately. but sharing a minor embarrassing moment early signals you're safe to open up to.

try this tomorrow: next time you're meeting someone new or trying to build rapport, deliberately share one small imperfection early in the conversation. not anything serious, just something human. ""i'm terrible with names so please remind me"" or ""i definitely overthought what to wear today."" watch how fast the dynamic shifts.

the people who are most magnetic aren't the ones who never mess up. they're the ones who are clearly competent but also clearly human. they've mastered something most of us haven't, showing strength and vulnerability in the same breath without it feeling contradictory.

this whole concept flips traditional advice on its head. we've been told to fake it till we make it, to never let them see you sweat, to maintain perfect professional polish. but the research consistently shows that calculated imperfection builds more trust, likability and influence than perfection ever could.

start small. pick one low stakes situation this week and intentionally show a minor flaw. see what happens. chances are you'll be surprised at how much warmer the response is compared to your usual polished persona.",1,1768419072.0,focusedmen,0,1.0,False

Not $847 in savings. That was my total net worth. Checking account, savings account, everything combined. At 25 years old.

I was working a job that paid $32k a year. After taxes and basic expenses I had maybe $200 left each month. And I’d blow through that $200 in the first week on food delivery, random Amazon purchases, and going out with friends I couldn’t afford to keep up with.

Every month I’d tell myself this is the month I’d save money. Then something would come up. Car repair. Medical bill. Friend’s birthday. Concert tickets I couldn’t pass up. Always something that justified spending money I didn’t have.

I had $4,200 in credit card debt that I was paying minimum payments on. The interest alone was eating $60 a month. I was literally paying money just to stay in debt.

My parents were patient but I could see the disappointment. I’d graduated college 3 years earlier and I was in worse financial shape than when I was a student. At least in college being broke made sense. At 25 with a full time job, living at home, still being broke was just embarrassing.

I couldn’t afford to move out. Couldn’t afford my own place. Couldn’t even afford to split rent with roommates because I had nothing for a deposit and first month’s rent.

Dates were humiliating. I’d have to suggest cheap places or make excuses. Couldn’t take anyone back to my place because I lived with my parents. My dating life was nonexistent.

Friends were moving forward. Getting their own apartments. Taking trips. Building careers. Saving for houses. Meanwhile I was stuck in my childhood bedroom trying to figure out where my money went every month.

I knew I wasn’t making enough but I also knew I was spending stupidly. I’d look at my bank account and have no idea where $1,500 went. Just gone. Probably food delivery and impulse purchases and subscriptions I forgot I had.

The worst part was I’d tried to fix it multiple times. Made budgets I never followed. Deleted delivery apps I’d reinstall the next day. Promised myself I’d cook at home and then ordered Chipotle because I was tired. Nothing stuck.

I felt trapped. Making too little to save, spending too much to get ahead, stuck living at home with no path forward.

# THE BREAKING POINT

My younger cousin came to visit for the holidays. She’s 23. Just out of college for one year.

We were talking and she mentioned she’d just signed a lease on her own apartment. Not with roommates, her own place.

I asked how she afforded it. She made about the same as me, maybe a bit less.

She said she’d been tracking every dollar she spent for the past year. Realized she was wasting like $800 a month on stuff that didn’t matter. Cut that out, saved aggressively for 8 months, and had enough for the deposit and emergency fund.

I felt this wave of shame. My 23 year old cousin had her life together financially while I was broke at 25 still living at home.

That night I looked at my spending from the past month. $340 on food delivery. $180 on going out. $95 on subscriptions I barely used. $120 on random shit I didn’t need. Almost $750 wasted in one month.

If I’d saved that for the past year I’d have $9,000 saved. More than enough to move out. Instead I had $847 total and a pile of takeout containers in my room.

I was broke because I was financially illiterate and undisciplined. Not because I didn’t make enough. Because I spent everything I made on stupid shit.

# WHY I WAS LIKE THIS

I spent the next few days thinking about why I was such a mess with money.

On the surface I told myself I just wasn’t good with money. That I didn’t make enough to save. That unexpected expenses always came up.

But that was bullshit. The real issue was I had zero financial awareness and zero discipline.

I never tracked my spending so I had no idea where money went. It just disappeared. I’d check my account and be surprised it was low even though I’d been ordering delivery twice a day.

I also had no financial goals. No reason to save. No plan. Just vaguely thinking I should save money someday but never actually doing it because there was no concrete target.

And I had instant gratification completely wired into my brain. Hungry? Order delivery. Bored? Buy something on Amazon. Friends going out? Go even though I couldn’t afford it. Every impulse got satisfied immediately.

There was also zero accountability. No one checking my spending. No consequences for blowing money. Just me disappointing myself over and over which apparently wasn’t enough to change.

I was broke because I’d built a life with no financial structure and no discipline.

# FAILED ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE

I’d tried fixing this before. Always failed.

Attempt 1: Made a detailed budget. Followed it for 3 days. Broke it on day 4 when I was hungry and ordered Thai food. Never looked at the budget again.

Attempt 2: Deleted all delivery apps. Lasted one week. Reinstalled them because I was tired after work and didn’t want to cook.

Attempt 3: Told myself I’d transfer $500 to savings every month. Did it once. Then had “unexpected expenses” and transferred it back. Never did it again.

Attempt 4: Tried the cash envelope method. Lost the envelopes. Went back to card.

Every attempt failed because I had no real system and no external enforcement. Just relying on motivation which disappeared the moment I wanted something.

# WHAT ACTUALLY CHANGED

I was scrolling Reddit at like 1am and found a post about someone who’d completely turned their life around in 60 days by following a structured plan.

They weren’t talking about money specifically but the concept hit me. They said discipline isn’t built through motivation, it’s built through structure that forces you to show up even when you don’t want to.

Look, I’m gonna tell you what worked for me and I know it might sound like I’m selling something. I’m not getting paid to say this. But I also get if you’re skeptical because I was too. All I’m saying is this is what finally worked after I failed on my own for 3 years straight. You can take it or leave it, that’s your call.

I found this app called Reload that builds 60 day transformation plans. It’s not a financial app, it’s more about building discipline and structure into your entire life. But that’s exactly what I needed because my money problems were really discipline problems.

Set it up and it asked me questions about my situation and goals. Built me a complete 60 day plan with daily tasks. Wake up time, morning routine, work schedule, skill building time, everything structured.

Here’s what made the difference. It blocked all my time wasting and money wasting sites during scheduled hours. YouTube, Reddit, Instagram, but also Amazon, food delivery apps, all of it blocked during the day.

Couldn’t impulse buy on Amazon during work because the site wouldn’t load. Couldn’t order Uber Eats in the evening because the app was blocked. The temptation was just removed.

The plan also had me building actual skills. Cooking became a required daily task. Job hunting and resume building became scheduled activities. Learning new skills that could increase my income became part of the routine.

I was skeptical as hell but also desperate. Committed to 60 days.

## Week 1 and 2, I had to face my spending

Week 1 the plan had me doing a financial audit as one of the daily tasks. Track every dollar for 7 days.

Seeing it all laid out was horrifying. $340 on food delivery like I’d calculated, but also $60 on coffee, $45 on a subscription box I’d forgotten about, $30 on mobile games, $25 on streaming services I never watched.

I was bleeding money in a thousand tiny cuts and had never noticed because I never tracked it.

The delivery apps were blocked from 5pm to 10pm during my scheduled productive hours. First few nights I was pissed. I was hungry and couldn’t order food.

Had to actually cook. Made pasta. Took 15 minutes. Cost $3. Would’ve been $25 delivered.

Week 2 one of my tasks was cancel unused subscriptions. Went through everything. Cancelled the subscription box, two streaming services I never watched, a gym membership I hadn’t used in 4 months, some app subscriptions.

Saved $87 per month just from cutting stuff I’d forgotten existed.

By end of week 2 I’d saved $230 just from being forced to cook and cutting subscriptions. That’s more than I usually had left at the end of a month.

## Week 3 and 4, cooking became routine

Week 3 and 4 the plan required meal prep every Sunday. It was a scheduled task I had to complete to rank up in the app.

Made lunch and dinner for the week. Cost maybe $60 in groceries. Would’ve been $300 in delivery.

The blocking made it impossible to escape into my old habits. Amazon blocked during the day meant no impulse purchases during work. Delivery apps blocked in the evening meant I had to eat what I’d prepped.

By end of month 1 I’d saved $740. More than I’d ever saved in a month in my entire life.

## Month 2, I started building real skills

Month 2 the plan increased difficulty. Wake time moved earlier. Skill development time increased to 90 minutes daily.

I’d chosen web development as my skill to learn. The plan structured it with daily lessons and project building.

But it also had me applying to better jobs as a daily task. Update resume, send 3 applications, practice interview questions. Stuff I’d been avoiding for years.

The structure forced me to actually do it. Couldn’t skip because it was part of my daily completion checklist.

Applied to 45 jobs that month. Got 6 interviews. Failed most of them but I was learning.

Food costs stayed low because delivery apps were still blocked and cooking was routine now. Saved another $680 that month.

Started putting extra money toward my credit card. Paid $520 that month. Balance actually went down for the first time ever.

## Month 3, I got a better job

Month 3 I got a job offer. $46k, $14k more than I was making. Not amazing money but a significant jump.

The interview prep the plan forced me to do daily had worked. I was ready. Nailed the interview.

Took the job. Suddenly had an extra $900 per month after taxes.

The plan immediately restructured my savings goals around the new income. That extra money was getting split between aggressive debt payoff and savings.

Paid $850 toward my credit card that month. Balance dropped below $3,000 for the first time in 2 years.

Saved another $820. Savings account hit $2,240.

My parents noticed. Asked if something changed. Told them I’d been following a structured plan that forced me to build discipline. They looked relieved.

## Month 4 and 5, everything accelerated

Month 4 and 5 I was fully locked in. The habits were solid. Cooking, saving, skill building, all automatic now.

Credit card payments were $900 and $950. Balance dropped to $1,200 then $250.

Savings grew to $3,100 then $4,300.

The web dev skills I’d been building daily led to a freelance project. Made an extra $600. All of that went to savings.

Month 5 I paid off the credit card completely. Zero balance. Debt free for the first time since college.

## Month 6, I moved out

Month 6 I had $5,800 saved. Found an apartment for $1,100 a month. Needed $2,200 for deposit and first month.

Paid it. Moved out of my parents’ house. Had $3,600 left as emergency fund.

My own place, zero debt, emergency fund, better job, actual skills. Six months earlier all of that seemed impossible.

# WHERE I AM NOW

It’s been 8 months total since I started. I’m living in my own apartment making $46k. Zero debt. $6,200 in my emergency fund.

I’m also freelancing on the side using the web dev skills I built, making an extra $800 to $1,200 a month.

Still use the app daily because the blocking and structure prevent me from sliding back. The moment those distractions and spending temptations are unblocked I know I’d fall back into old patterns.

My cousin visited my new place last month. She was proud of me. Said she knew I could do it.

# WHAT I LEARNED

Being broke isn’t always about income. I was making $32k and broke. Now making $46k plus freelance and I’m saving half my income. The difference is discipline not dollars.

You can’t fix money problems without fixing discipline problems. Every budget failed because I had no system enforcing it. Structure that works when motivation doesn’t is what actually works.

Blocking temptation beats resisting it. I couldn’t resist delivery apps and Amazon through willpower. But when they won’t open during my weak hours, I can’t spend.

Building skills is the real path out. Saving money helped short term. Learning web development and getting a better job changed my entire trajectory.

Small daily tasks compound into life transformation. Cooking daily saved money. Applying to jobs daily got me interviews. Learning daily built skills. None of it felt massive but it added up.

External structure is more powerful than internal motivation. The plan forced me to do things I would’ve skipped. That forced action built the habits that changed everything.

Debt keeps you trapped. $60 a month in interest was $720 a year just to stay in debt. Killing that freed up cash flow.

You need concrete goals with deadlines. “Save money” never worked. “Save $3,000 in 6 months to move out” gave me something real to work toward.

# IF YOU’RE BROKE LIVING AT HOME

Track your spending for one week. Every dollar. You probably have no idea where it actually goes.

Cut the obvious waste. Delivery apps, unused subscriptions, impulse purchases. You probably have $500 plus bleeding out monthly.

Get structure that forces action. I’m gonna be straight with you, this is gonna sound like I’m pushing something and maybe you’ll think I’m full of shit. I used Reload to build a 60 day plan that structured my entire life and blocked my money wasting habits during scheduled hours. It’s not a finance app, it’s a discipline app, but my money problems were discipline problems. It worked when everything else failed. If you want to keep trying on your own, cool. But if you keep failing like I did for 3 years, you need external structure forcing you to stick to it. Take it or leave it.

Build skills that increase income. Saving is good. Earning more is better. Both together is how you actually get ahead.

Set a specific goal with a deadline. Moving out in 6 months. Debt free in 4 months. Whatever makes it concrete and urgent.

Pay off high interest debt aggressively. That interest is bleeding you. Kill it.

Accept it’s restrictive. Not being able to order food whenever I wanted sucked. Being broke at 25 living at home sucked more.

Give it 6 months minimum. One month won’t show much. Six months you’ll be unrecognizable.

# FINAL THOUGHTS

Eight months ago I was broke at 25 living with my parents with $847 to my name. I genuinely thought I’d be stuck there for years.

Now I have my own place, zero debt, savings growing, better income, actual skills, and freelance work on the side.

I’m not special. I’m not particularly smart or disciplined naturally. I just found a system that worked even when I was weak.

You’re probably not broke because you don’t earn enough. You’re broke because you have no structure preventing you from wasting what you earn.

Get structure. Build skills. Force the discipline. Give it 6 months.

See what happens when you stop wasting money and start building your way out.

The version of you with your own place and savings and skills exists. You just have to build the structure that forces you to become that person.

What’s one wasteful habit you could cut today?

Stop being broke. Start today.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",0,1768418574.0,getdisciplined,1,0.33,False

He put the box on the coffee table and started his usual ritual of cleaning the gun. 
  I heard Marina start to cry harder and yelled for her to go into my bedroom and lock the door. When someone upset the kids, I saw red. They were my babies and I wasn't going to let anything happen to them. I proceeded to go over to him and told him to put the gun down. He didn't even look up at me” Put the gun down!” I yelled even louder. He looked up at me with a smirk on his face and continued to clean and then load the shotgun. 
  At that point I ran up to him and started trying to get the gun out of his hands. If he ended up in jail,  what would we do? I didn't want him hurting our neighbor, wether he was an asshole or not.  What if he accidentally shot one of us? What if he really shot through the wall and killed the man? All of these thoughts were running through my head and I just reacted.
  We started wrestling with the gun and I was screaming at him the whole time that he was going to kill someone. He told me” that was the point” and held on to the gun screaming at me to let go. “ Let go!”he  kept saying as we continued to wrestle.
 Well,  I didn't let go and I didn't care at that point if he shot me. I was in panic mode and protective mode. Those kids weren't going to get hurt with me around.

And for the past two months or so they have mentioned that it is not frothing the milk nearly as much as it used to.

They rinse the carafe with water regularly but I went and bought Delonghi's own cleaner specifically meant to get rid of milk that could clog it up. (Running the solution through it multiple times, and also soaking it in the solution + hot water as per their instructions) After I used that they said it got a bit better but unfortunately not anywhere near when I got it for them. They said initially it frothed the milk so much you could eat it with a spoon while now it is maybe half as much. (And was even less prior to the milk cleaning solution)

I contacted Delonghi but it has been almost a month of radio silence. Though I suppose I should give them a call instead.

I am not a coffee drinker myself so I have no real frame of reference for how it should be unfortunately but I've tried the milk cleaning solution, and I even bought milk specifically sold as ""coffee milk"" which should froth more easily to no avail. (Instead of what they always get normally)

Naturally I've also run the descaler and all of that too. (the water here is very soft but still I've done it multiple times) The steam appears to come out as usual so hopefully the machine itself is not defective.

I've been thinking if I should just try and get a new carafe and compare the performance if Delonghi proves to be of no assistance. But the machine is still under warranty so I would expect Delonghi to provide some input at the very least.

Anyone else experienced this where the machine froths less over time despite thorough cleaning? (Provided I have not missed anything obvious after reading the manual and looking at their official cleaning videos)

My parents use the machine every day so I don't believe they would suddenly forget how much the machine froths but that could always be a factor that they are misremembering how good it was at the start.

Any and all input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",1,1768418364.0,DeLonghi,1,1.0,False

I am not talking to anyone else nor am I on and other sites. he however is on a site that I am aware of and knew he had talked to someone Sunday. so when I get to his Monday he is spraying stuff on the bed and their is a wine bottle beside the bed I asked why the wine was in the bedroom he said bc he had been drinking the night before and had sprayed the bed bc he had really bad gas. we watch some tv together then I go into the bedroom and workout do my devotional and go to bed. next morning everything is fine I make him breakfast and coffee and get him off to work he calls while working and we are fine then he ask me to stay again but I said I had a few things at home I needed to get done he got mad and thats where I goes down hill. we get into over something he accuses me of having someone else which I say I don’t bc I legit don’t. but as the convo to he tells me he can get someone that night and I say I could have to I had 2exs text me but I blocked them he says how did they text you if they was blocked I said bc they had been deleted first then when they texted and I found out it was them I blocked them. he then accused me of hoeing around and demanded that I get the rest of my stuff out of his house so I gather everything up and try to leave before he got off but he wanted me to wait he went through everything to make sure I hadn’t taken anything of his. our first Christmas he bought me a certain stuff animal that I would sleep with when I was there and I bought him the girl one matched mine. so we have had these for about 2 years now. I tried to take mine and he wouldn’t let me said he was going to put them in his safe. but why would he want to keep something that was so personal to me? he told me he hated me and never wanted me back at his house. then later when I got home he called to see what I had of his at my house and then he told me he just needed sometime. so I’m so confused. help me out why did he keep my stuff animal and what’s his deal why get made at me for telling him the truth about the exs that I did block when he is clearly talking to other people? it’s like it’s okay he does it but not me.,1,1768418299.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1qcwei4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qcwei4/rf_sharp/,[RF] Sharp,"For what could have been the hundredth time today, I looked down at my coffee mug, hoping it had magically refilled. Unfortunately, it was still as empty as the queue leading to my desk. Around me, the giant hall was buzzing. Young women and teenagers were chatting while queuing. Loud founders were trying to attract talents by boasting about being ‘the next Google/H&M/Starbucks’ to a cheering crowd of their own desperate employees. At the overwhelmed coffee counter, a group of underpaid teenagers was losing a desperate battle against a broken coffee machine.

It was my second year participating in the Young Women's Career Empowering Day as a senior software engineer. Over the six-hour event, four girls came to my desk, which was a notable improvement from last year. Most of their questions related to not wanting to be the only woman in their class.

To my right, the design stand had been much busier. Holding it was a woman in her early thirties whose appearance and manners could be described in one word: sharp.  
A badge reading ‘Lead Graphic Designer’ was pinned on her professional yet creative orange and black suit, perfectly fitting with her long tangerine hair, tidily braided down her back. Her glasses and jewellery evoked elegance, wit, and appeared serrated enough to cut through several layers of steel.

After long hours, the uninterrupted stream of young women in front of her desk had finally dried. She was enjoying a little break when we both noticed a young lady fluttering back and forth, ever closer, before finally landing at her desk.  
In complete opposition to my neighbour, she was wearing the kind of clothes you could find on Google Image by typing ‘comfortable’. Her short, black, curly hair exploded around her head. Her face hid under the combined powers of a pink hoodie, a black cowl, large Sony headphones, and big, round oak-coloured glasses.  
‘Welcome,’ the sharp one started, ‘I am Mariah, Lead Graphic Designer at Denzell Dynamics.’ You could hear the upper-cased letters.  
Her new interlocutor raised a hesitant head from her cowl, as if she was about to speak, reconsidered for a moment, and finally breathed, ‘Well, hum... I-I wanted to ask about…’ She paused, inhaled deeply, and announced: ‘My name is Sabrina, and I just finished my bachelor's in graphic design and…’ She deflated and murmured: ‘I mean, I am trying to figure out what I should specialise in for my master's.’  
‘Great. Do you already have preferences for a subfield?’ Mariah answered cheerfully.  
‘Well…’, Sabrina hesitated, ‘I’d like to be an animator. But my teacher... he said I was better at web design.’  
‘Good. Your teacher already knows where he wants to specialise.’  
‘What-what do you mean?’  
‘You already knew where to go.’  
Sabrina looked down at something on the desk.  
‘But, also, if I study animation... I mean, the animation school is far from my home, and I would have to find a job to pay for a flat. I mean, I started applying, but was only offered unpaid internships.’

There was a brief moment of silence. I let my gaze stroll across the crowd and noticed a young woman with a geeky Yoda T-shirt staring at my stand with hesitation. Her more fashionable friend grabbed her shoulder and sneered at me while whispering in her ear, dragging her back into the dense crowd.

‘I mean, I understand I would gain valuable experience... but that doesn't pay rent. That's why I was thinking about staying here. It's probably better.’  
'Tell me about your interviews.’  
‘Well, I tell the interviewers that I am hard-working, and I value the chance I have to… to work for them as a great opportunity, of course.’  
One of Mariah's eyebrows rose almost imperceptibly up.  
‘If you sell yourself as inferior, that's what they'll buy,’ the Lead Graphic Designer started. ‘Companies are not kind and caring. They are income-optimising machines. They only pay to increase value. Can you generate value?’  
Sabrina hesitated for a moment. Again, she looked down and stared at the spot on the table that only she could see.  
‘I don't know. I mean, yeah, I guess I can.’  
‘Do you have an online portfolio?’  
‘I have a few projects, but I don't think they are good enough to be online,’ she muttered.  
Mariah took out her phone, manipulated it swiftly, and handed it to her junior.  
‘This page belongs to one of my favourite artists. What do you think of her latest posts?’  
‘Oh! They are so cool. I wish I were that good.’  
‘Now, look at the first ones.’  
Sabrina scrolled, and scrolled, and scrolled, her thumb bobbing up and down the screen. Her eyes and mouth gaped progressively wider.  
‘No one starts good enough.’ Mariah interjected. ‘Show what you have. If only to monitor your own progress.’  
Sabrina kept scrolling with marvel.  
‘Look at me,’ her senior ordered, ‘I want you to crystallise what follows in your mind. People will believe in you only if you believe in yourself first.’  
The spot became fascinating again.  
‘Look how far you have gone. You acquired a degree and delivered several successful projects. It matters not what others think. Take pride in your achievements.’  
The young woman looked up, her eyes twinkling with admiration.  
Mariah swiftly pinched a card from the nearly empty stack on her right.  
‘Alright. This is my card. Contact me if you need more advice or feedback on your work.’  
Sabrina received the card with both hands and gave a slight bow.  
‘Thank you. I will try my best.’  
‘Do or do not. There is no try,’ Mariah nerded in conclusion.  
The aspiring animator bounced her head up and down, thanked Mariah one more time, and strode away with newfound confidence.

‘The next Amazon!’ someone yelled louder than necessary. One of the teenagers working at the café stand started sobbing. My mug was still empty.  
Mariah's head turned mechanically to me.  
‘Sandra, is it?’  
Her call straightened my posture, like a sharp blade planted through my spine.  
‘Yes!’  
‘Four, this year? Don't let it discourage you. It's better than last year. Keep up the good work.’  
‘Thank you,’ I answered astouned. I turned my gaze to the crowd again and remembered someone earlier. ‘Let's make it five,’ I beamed, and dashed from my desk.",1,1768418027.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1qcwdh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1qcwdh2/vent_after_my_mom_passed_away/,Vent after my mom passed away," My mom unexpectedly passed away on Thursday - my dad found her that morning on the couch when he brought his coffee into the living room. She had been sick for years - COPD, oxygen use - and had a case of flu, although it seemed like she was on the mend, I’m a nurse so my dad typically calls me to take a look at her anytime he thinks shes unwell, but he said that she seemed to be getting over it. When my dad found her, her oxygen that she had to use 24/7 was on the floor beside her, like she had taken it off (which she did frequently to like, blow her nose, have a cigarette, etc). I’m not sure if she got tangled in it in her sleep and pulled it off bc it was annoying her, or if she had forget to put it on after sitting up to smoke a cigarette, or something. But She seemed peaceful when I saw her, which brings me comfort. 

None of us ever thought she’d pass away like that - I think we always assumed she’d be in the hospital or on hospice or something, so we’d be able to see her and say goodbye and stuff…. It was a shock that it happened so suddenly. But she was still a full code, wasn’t ready to make end of life discussion, etc. she had just celebrated her 65th birthday before Christmas. 

My mom was obviously not healthy, and had some congestive decline - I think just related to the chronic hypercapnia. She was starting to get confused with like time of day, couldn’t remember when I was born or how old I was, stuff like that. But she was a stubborn woman, and strongly believed her time wasn’t going to be coming anytime soon. So I’ve been trying to tell myself that this freak thing that happened was likely the most peaceful death should could have had. She was so scared to die - I’m really happy she didn’t know it was coming her way. 

My sister (42) is significantly older than me (I’m 29). She’s been no contact with my mom for years because she struggles with addiction and mental health issues. I obviously called my sister to tell her about our mom, and I’m so scared it’ll force her into a relapse. She was texting me about her cravings to use again while I was on my way to the funeral home with my dad to make my mom’s arrangements. 

Afterwards, my sister asked if we purchased a separate urn for her to have some of her ashes. I told her no - I didn’t think our mom would have wanted her body split up. She never talked about her wishes, but she wouldn’t even consider organ donation when she was young bc she didn’t want any part of her body removed. Her urn is getting laid to rest above my nanas casket in our family plot, and I firmly believe she’d want all her ashes there. Also my sister and my mom had an awful relationship most of my life. My sisters struggled off an on with homelessness, I don’t think she’d be responsible in keeping something as important as an urn of our mothers ashes safe. 

But - of course it wasn’t a simple conversation. My sister blew up on me, saying I didn’t treat her like one of my mom’s children, that no one was supporting her wishes, and that she wasn’t even really apart of our family. She ended her multi text rant with “I’ll let you know if I decide to come to the funeral. my prayers and condolences to your family during this hard time.” 

I’m so mad because 1. My mom is dead. 2. My sister never had to watch her decline over the last couple of years. And 3. I’m just trying my best to support my dad and my kids during this time. 

I’m sad because I wish I had one of my siblings here to grieve with, but my sister just isn’t stable enough to lean on, and my older brother (also suffers from addiction) has been missing for years. My husband’s is an amazing support, but I just miss the people who should have loved my mom the way I do. My dad is an amazing human, but I don’t want to stress him out - he’s in his 80s, and I think he’s at his grief limit, I’m trying to keep a strong face on for him. He’s had heart attacks and stuff before, I can’t handle the guilt of him seeing how hard this is for me.  

My sister showed up at my dad’s doorstep a few days ago, unexpectedly. Thankfully I was there. She got a few of mom’s things, which I was fine with. We let her know mom didn’t have life insurance or anything. I think maybe she assumed she’d get some inheritance or something, but that’s not the case. My dad and I paid for her arrangements out of our savings. 

I love my sister, but I hate her, especially right now. She’s done some terrible things in her life, including some really awful neglect to her four oldest kids, who she doesn’t have custody of. It’ll be hard to see her at the funeral if she goes. It’ll be hard to not have her there. It’s just… hard.

At the game, we were *forced* to buy the cup to get coffee at all. The stand was La Monarca Bakery (which I normally like), and it may not even be their call — it felt like the team required vendors to bundle the cup with any coffee purchase.

I’ve now used the cup four times, and no matter what I do, my coffee has a strange aftertaste. I’ve washed it thoroughly with soap and water each time, hoping it was just some “new cup” residue, but the flavor keeps coming back. What’s weird is that I notice it whether the coffee is from home *or* from the office — the common factor is the cup.

Best case, it’s just a matter of altering the taste. Worst case… I’m wondering if something about the material or coating might be leaching into hot drinks.

This really stood out on a cold playoff night when I *needed* that coffee — I’ve got a two-hour drive home after games, and instead of being warmed up and caffeinated, I was distracted by the odd taste and low-key worried about what I was drinking.

This will be on a Sunday night so not sure if there’s any breweries/bars that are open late on Sundays.

Additional question: Neither of us have seen the West Coast so we’re wondering if it’s worth it to take the drive out to the coast Monday morning before we fly home Monday night? And if so, where to go to get the best views/take a coastal walk by the beach?

Edit for more info: We will be renting a car so getting to the coast wouldn’t be a problem! Just want to know if it’s worth our time.

Henry and I were born six weeks early. 

Mom says we came out looking like a pair of grapes. Our lips and skin were dyed a dull bluish-purple, and she could almost fit both of us in the palm of her hand. It's an outrageously gentle way of describing two premature babies in the process of suffocating, but I guess that’s Mom for you. 

Put more bluntly, Henry and I were born on death's door.

We couldn’t breathe, not on our own, not with the equipment that God loaned us. Machines were tasked with breathing for us in the neonatal ICU. Tubes as thin as coffee straws pumped microscopic gulps of fresh air down our throats, offloading our immature lungs, giving them space to rest and develop. For a little while, it seemed like the worst was over. Seemed like we both would live. Seemed like we’d both be normal.    

Then, I bled into my brain. 

The vessels were too young, too fragile. One of them snapped. Blood pooled quickly, crushing whole sections of my brain against the inside of my skull. The surgeons told Mom I had a fifty percent chance of survival, but I’d almost certainly be damaged goods if I did pull through. 

When our tempers flare, Henry likes to speculate.

He thinks that if I *hadn't* survived, Dad may have decided to stick around. Maybe he wouldn’t have gotten so overwhelmed. Perhaps he could have stomached the burden of a single, normal kid. Forces me to remind him that Dad bolted for the border the day we were born, a full week before my brain bled. He sprinted from the delivery room at the mere sight of us - his grape-skinned, breathless, keychain babies.

That said, cerebral palsy and deafness aren’t the worst cards I could've been dealt.

So what if my ears don’t work? So what if my muscles aren’t perfect? It is what it is. If we’re to blame for Dad’s abandonment, then so be it, but I won’t shoulder the blame alone. I mean, that’s what twins do, right? We split the world down the middle and share it equally, including the shitty parts? *Especially* the shitty parts?

Anyway...

Last week, for the first time in fifteen years, I heard something.

I heard *them*. 

Digging through the earth, burrowing towards the surface. 

Coming to hollow us out. 

\- - - - -

***48 hours before they arrived:***

My eyes shot open. 

There was a strange pressure in my skull, a thrumming beneath my temples. 

Terror chewed through my chest. I launched myself from bed, strapped on my arm braces, and scrambled into the hallway to pound on Grandpa’s door. Mom would come running at the slightest noise, but Grandpa slept like a corpse.

The drive to the emergency room was torture. I had no idea what was happening inside my skull. I assumed my brain was bleeding. That murderous vessel was deadset on finishing the job.

Henry bitched in the waiting room for hours because Mom wouldn’t let him stay home alone. He was convinced the sensation was “psychological”. Kept repeating the phrase “it’s just another Felix freak-out”. My brother didn’t just say it, either: he said it *and* signed it. Could have spared me the heartache by just whispering it when my head was turned, but no, he had to twist the knife.

It hurt even more when it started to seem like Henry was right. 

My physical exam was unremarkable. My bloodwork was fine. The CT scan didn’t show any blood sloshing around my brain. The doctor’s best guess? Sinus infection. 

A fucking *sinus infection*. 

Listen, I don’t blame that doctor; she was nice, and she tried. The idea that I could be hearing again would have been an outlandish hypothesis. Wasn't like I was much help, either. I had no experience with noise. I mean, I understood it conceptually. I knew the words - *screech, thud, buzz, boom, thump* \- but that’s all they were to me: words. Names of famous celebrities whose faces I’ve never seen. 

Touch felt like a cousin to sound, so I pictured hearing was like having a set of big, invisible fingertips. Maybe a shrill noise feels like touching a hot stove. Maybe a soft noise is like running my fingers over a clean, silk pillowcase. 

And what did *this* noise feel like, this thrumming below my temples?

Well, I was rummaging through the attic last year, digging through winter clothes, hunting for a lost sweater. When I finally found it and held it up, something shifted near the collar. A massive, black cockroach leapt out from the inside of that sweater. It landed on my cheek and skittered down the side of my neck before falling to floor and disappearing into the shadows. 

Chaotic.

Impulsive.

Unpredictable, restless, and willing to eat anything, exactly like a cockroach. 

*That’s* what it felt like. 

\- - - - -

***10 hours before they arrived:***

Henry shoved a forkful of roast beef into his mouth before he started complaining to Mom. Talking and chewing at the same time made it difficult for me to read his lips: it was all too sloppy. Henry loved pretending like he'd forgotten that fact.

I didn’t catch everything he said. 

“Why - - - coddling him? You - - - care of him forever - - - not my job - - - protect him.”

*If you’re going to talk about him, in front of him, you damn well better have the respect to let him know what you’re saying, Henry* \- my Mom signed. Her hands moved forcefully, as if an evaluator was hiding somewhere in the room, covertly grading her clarity and technique. One of her chipped gel nails flew across the room as she signed the word *respect*. 

Shame writhed like a serpent stuck in my gut. I looked to Grandpa. He was scooping his fork over the table, trying to wrassle some meat, missing the plate again and again. My Mom’s anxious eyes caught me looking to him for comfort. Sometimes it felt like she couldn’t stop watching me, even if she wanted to. 

“PHIL!” 

“Hmm...?” he replied, still focused on fishing some dinner from his plate. 

“Your glasses?” Grandpa furrowed his brow. Then, there was a burst of recognition, a *Eureka!* moment. I could practically see the dusty light bulb flicker dimly above his head. 

“Oh! Right, right, right...” A pair of thick glasses rested on his sternum, hanging from his neck via a gold chain. Mom made sure he was always wearing the necklace, but he would often take off the glasses and forget they were there anyway. He patted his shirt until his hand stumbled upon the glasses, then slid them on. His face broke into a warm, genuine smile, finally able to see us.

*How was your day, Grandpa?* \- I signed. 

*Pretty good! Another beautiful afternoon to be delivering mail. Just between us, I think Miss. Hudson has the hots for me - don’t tattle to her husband, though, alright?* - he signed back. 

He blew imaginary smoke from a pair of finger guns and winked at me. I forced a grin and nodded. Henry's face contorted into a scowl, gaze fixed on his mashed potatoes, stirring them harshly. 

Grandpa was long retired. He hadn’t delivered mail in years.

Age had taken a toll on his mind. His memory had become like the weather: clear one day, cloudy the next, and the forecast could change on a dime. Despite his senility, the seventy-six-year-old was remarkably spry, lean, and energetic. On good days, I was happy to know that at least his body was still intact, but on shittier days, his situation just tasted like a bitter irony. He had beautifully maintained machinery, but he wasn’t always behind the wheel. I was beyond grateful that his ASL remained intact, but, perhaps more than anything else, I feared the inevitable day that would no longer be the case. 

I speared a mushy tuft of steamed broccoli onto my fork. My hand abruptly went from steady to trembling.

All day, the pressure had been sharpening, accelerating, intensifying. I looked around the dinner table. Nobody else appeared to notice. All the tests were normal. It was my sinuses. It *had* to be my sinuses. 

Try as I might, I couldn’t buy my own story, and Mom could smell the panic burning beneath my skin.

*Are you okay? How’s your head?*  \- she signed. 

I pointed a half-hearted thumbs-up in her direction. How could burden her with the truth?

Hadn't she suffered enough at the hands of my dysfunction for one lifetime? 

*See? He’s fine. He’s strong. Quit worrying.* \- Henry signed. 

I suppressed the urge to smile. 

When I looked back at my plate, I realized Grandpa wasn’t eating. He was staring absentmindedly at the floor, head turned towards me. His glasses had slipped into his baggy T-shirt, tenting the fabric at his chest. He was muttering to himself. I couldn’t make out most of the words, and what I did catch made no sense.

“Dirty little - - - squishing around - - - tangled, tangled - - - disgusting, tiny, tangled strings” 

I did catch one phrase for certain. It was the last thing he muttered before becoming silent.

“I see you.” 

\- - - - -

***30 seconds before they arrived***\*:\*

As we drove through town, the cryptic pressure in my head burst unexpectedly. Reminded me of popping an inflamed zit. There was a blip of pain, yes, but it was followed by rush of blissful relief. 

I turned to Henry. He had his head leaning against the window, jaw stiff, shoulders tensed to his ears. Guess I had a big, doofy smile on my face, because he shot back a mocking look. Tongue out. Eyes crossed. I imagine he would’ve flipped me the bird if we weren’t in the car with Mom. 

He was livid. We were an hour late for his soccer game. 

Both grandpa and I can be tricky to mobilize. Did we take our meds? Do we have our necessary outside-the-house gear? Plus, we just move *slow*. It’s a miracle if we’re only fifteen minutes late for any given appointment. I wasn’t the issue that morning, though. I knew better than to be unprepared on game day. Nothing aggravates Henry more. 

No, there was something wrong with Grandpa. 

Mom told me he was feeling under the weather. He didn’t look sick, though. He looked vacant. Not his usual, diet-dementia aloofness, either. He looked like his soul had departed his body. His glasses had gone missing, too. 

And he was still muttering nonsense under his breath.

Our beat-up sedan lurched to a clunky stop at a red light. I racked my brain, coming up with ways I could support Henry. 

I could make sure he stays hydrated? 

The light turned green. Our car wobbled forward. 

Or maybe I'd give him permission to lie to his teammates. Henry could tell them he was late on my account. That’d be bad for me in the short term, but it’d probably be easier for him to explain than whatever the hell was going on with Grandpa...

We came to a sudden, jagged halt. 

Old coffee cups flew from their cupholders, drenching the dashboard in stagnant brown liquid as the soggy cardboard fell apart. My seat belt became rigid, biting into my chest to keep me in place. My woozy heart thundered into back of my throat.

We’d stopped at the end of a narrow, one-way street hemmed in by two monolithic brick buildings. The right bumper was tilted down, and the tire was stuck. 

Mom turned and signed: *STAY.* She stepped out to check the damage. My body trembled, nearly convulsing from the surprise of it all.

Henry grabbed my hand. 

He dragged his thumb along the underside of my wrist, slow and steady. I felt myself becoming grounded. Outside, Mom was staring at the hood, scratching the back of her head. She peered through the window and gestured:

*Pothole? Or...sinkhole? Can’t tell. It’s very deep. Stay in the car, I’m calling the police.* 

My breathing became ragged. A deluge of adrenaline flooded through my veins. 

The pressure hadn't left me.

Suddenly, it was coming back, and it was coming back different.

When Henry and I were young, before he was fed up with my existence, before he saw me as this loathsome, pitiable burden, we loved the arcade. It was a place where we were equal, despite my brokenness. Every afternoon, we would scour the house for quarters, hoping against hope we would find a cache of loose change between some couch cushions or in a pair of Grandpa’s pants. If we were successful, we’d celebrate by shaking handfuls of coins in the air, making our closed fists rattle like macarenas. 

The pressure was like *that*. 

Rapid, rhythmic clinking. 

And, God, it was pressing in on me from every direction.

Grandpa leapt from the passenger’s seat and onto the sidewalk. He twisted around in manic circles, batting at the empty air around his legs, saliva dripping down the corner of his mouth, repeating the same word so violently that even I could tell what he was saying. 

**“WORMS.”**

**“WORMS.”**

**“WORMS.”**

Henry dug his nails into my flesh.

Mom dropped the phone from her ear. She stood by the bumper, dumbstruck, panic setting in thick. Her head kept darting between the car and Grandpa. I didn’t understand. I pointed wildly towards Grandpa, desperate to focus her attention. In his frenzy, he was getting closer and closer to the end of the one-way. He was going to spill out onto the busy road, and then, who knows? The man was basically blind without his glasses. 

Why, God, *why* wasn’t she running to save him? 

Henry yanked my arm, trying to pull me towards him. 

I spun to look at him. His face was drained of color, paler than fog. His eyes were bulging from their sockets. Never in my life had I seen my brother more petrified, and he wasn’t looking out the front of the car; he was staring at something right outside *my* window. 

The clinking noise was deafening. It filled my broken ears and left room for nothing else. 

I couldn’t hear the slack-jawed, dead-eyed man, silently slamming his limp arms against the glass, one after the other, an endless, hypnotic barrage. 

And the glass was starting to splinter. 

I couldn’t move. It wasn’t just terror that rooted me to the seat. I was mesmerized by the vibrations under his skin. The flesh expanded. Spaghetti-thick cords would rise across every inch of his body. There was no order to their arrangement. They weren’t stationed in parallel or in a neat cross-stitch. They were a chaotic, tangled mess. A second later, the cords retracted, and his skin appeared normal. 

Expand. **Clink.** 

He threw his flaccid arm over his shoulder.

Retract. **Clink.** 

It fell like a meteor, helpless to gravity, and shattered the window. A hailstorm of glass engulfed me. He moved to lean his head into the car. 

Mom bounded into view and tackled him at the waist. 

The clinking ceased. 

The world was silent once more. 

I gripped the edge of the broken window and threw my head out. Glass dug into my palms, but I barely felt any pain. 

I needed to see that Mom was OK.

Relief surged out of me in a single, shaky breath.

She was kneeling on the narrow sidewalk, stunned, trembling, but intact. What was left of the man lay in front of her. 

He wasn’t dead. Dead isn’t the right word. 

The man shattered like a ceramic pot. 

The collision had tossed him into the brick wall of the nearby building, and the impact had broken him into two large pieces - one from the chest-up, the other from the waist-down. Dozens of other, smaller pieces were scattered around him: thin, rattling shards of dry human pottery.

He was empty on the inside. No guts, no blood, no heart: nothing at all. 

The worms had hollowed him out.

Mom turned, looked me in the eyes, and shot me a weak, world-weary smile. Somehow, she knew. If she stayed still, she could buy us time. She could make damn sure we got away. 

Her hands reached up to sign. 

The man’s shattered body seized. The clinking resumed with a hellish ferocity.

I couldn’t see them, but I could hear them, I could track their movements, getting closer, and closer, and closer to my Mom. Henry was behind me, reaching over my shoulder, stretching his hand out to pull her in, to keep her safe. 

I pushed him back. 

The clinking was upon her. She screamed, I think. Her mouth grew wide, her jaw became slack. They were infiltrating her. Hollowing her body until there was nothing left. 

Enough of her lingered to sign six final words.

*Take care of your brother, Felix.* 

Her fingers contorted into a bevy of unnatural, inhuman shapes. Her body went limp. 

Then, she began to pulse. 

Expand. **Clink.** 

Retract. **Clink.** 

For maybe the first time in our lives, Henry followed my lead. 

I shoved him out of the far door.

He put his arm around me, and we left.

I don’t know for sure that Grandpa’s dead, but I hope he is. 

Because if his hearts still beating, that means he’s either alone, scared, and confused, 

or hollowed out and somehow still alive. 

\- - - - -

For now, it seems like we're safe.

I was able to guide us out of town, avoiding the worms like landmines. They seem to cluster together and wait for victims, hiding in plain sight, but the only time they stop moving appears to be right before they leave or enter a host. Otherwise, they're always moving, which means I can hear them.

Everyone’s gone. The entire town is empty.

We passed by hundreds of tire-sized holes in the ground. I threw a quarter down one of them. Henry said he never heard it hit the bottom. I think the hollowed-outs slid down those holes. Don’t know where else they would’ve gone.

I don’t know why they’ve awakened from their dormancy deep within the earth, but I suppose it doesn’t matter. They’re here now. 

These things are a living paradox. 

Only the blind can see them.

Only the deaf can hear them. 

Nests of them writhed across my town's streets, through layers of salt deposited for a snowfall that never came. They clinked up a storm - twisting and squirming and tangling in on themselves - but the salt never shifted. Indirect detection doesn't seem like a viable strategy.

Want my advice? 

Hold your differently abled neighbors near and dear. 

Don’t have any?

That’s alright. 

From my perspective, you have two options.

You *could* roll the dice. Maybe this *isn’t* the beginning of some sort of worldwide annexation of the human race. Maybe my town was just very, very unlucky. 

But if you’d like to err on the safe side, might I recommend a screwdriver?

I mean, most people have a screwdriver. 

A screwdriver should be able to do the trick, no matter which way you take it. 

Blind or deaf, dealer's choice.

And if the broken are the only ones truly equipped to survive this, 

sooner or later, 

we may have to shift our perspective,

on what it means

“PHIL!” 

“Hmm...?” he replied, still focused on fishing some dinner from his plate. 

“Your glasses?” Grandpa furrowed his brow. Then, there was a burst of recognition, a *Eureka!* moment. I could practically see the dusty light bulb flicker dimly above his head. 

“Oh! Right, right, right...” A pair of thick glasses rested on his sternum, hanging from his neck via a gold chain. Mom made sure he was always wearing the necklace, but he would often take off the glasses and forget they were there anyway. He patted his shirt until his hand stumbled upon the glasses, then slid them on. His face broke into a warm, genuine smile, finally able to see us.

*How was your day, Grandpa?* \- I signed. 

*Pretty good! Another beautiful afternoon to be delivering mail. Just between us, I think Miss. Hudson has the hots for me - don’t tattle to her husband, though, alright?* - he signed back. 

He blew imaginary smoke from a pair of finger guns and winked at me. I forced a grin and nodded. Henry's face contorted into a scowl, gaze fixed on his mashed potatoes, stirring them harshly. 

Grandpa was long retired. He hadn’t delivered mail in years.

Age had taken a toll on his mind. His memory had become like the weather: clear one day, cloudy the next, and the forecast could change on a dime. Despite his senility, the seventy-six-year-old was remarkably spry, lean, and energetic. On good days, I was happy to know that at least his body was still intact, but on shittier days, his situation just tasted like a bitter irony. He had beautifully maintained machinery, but he wasn’t always behind the wheel. I was beyond grateful that his ASL remained intact, but, perhaps more than anything else, I feared the inevitable day that would no longer be the case. 

I speared a mushy tuft of steamed broccoli onto my fork. My hand abruptly went from steady to trembling.

All day, the pressure had been sharpening, accelerating, intensifying. I looked around the dinner table. Nobody else appeared to notice. All the tests were normal. It was my sinuses. It *had* to be my sinuses. 

Try as I might, I couldn’t buy my own story, and Mom could smell the panic burning beneath my skin.

*Are you okay? How’s your head?*  \- she signed. 

I pointed a half-hearted thumbs-up in her direction. How could burden her with the truth?

Hadn't she suffered enough at the hands of my dysfunction for one lifetime? 

*See? He’s fine. He’s strong. Quit worrying.* \- Henry signed. 

I suppressed the urge to smile. 

When I looked back at my plate, I realized Grandpa wasn’t eating. He was staring absentmindedly at the floor, head turned towards me. His glasses had slipped into his baggy T-shirt, tenting the fabric at his chest. He was muttering to himself. I couldn’t make out most of the words, and what I did catch made no sense.

“Dirty little - - - squishing around - - - tangled, tangled - - - disgusting, tiny, tangled strings” 

I did catch one phrase for certain. It was the last thing he muttered before becoming silent.

“I see you.” 

\- - - - -

***30 seconds before they arrived***\*:\*

As we drove through town, the cryptic pressure in my head burst unexpectedly. Reminded me of popping an inflamed zit. There was a blip of pain, yes, but it was followed by rush of blissful relief. 

I turned to Henry. He had his head leaning against the window, jaw stiff, shoulders tensed to his ears. Guess I had a big, doofy smile on my face, because he shot back a mocking look. Tongue out. Eyes crossed. I imagine he would’ve flipped me the bird if we weren’t in the car with Mom. 

He was livid. We were an hour late for his soccer game. 

Both grandpa and I can be tricky to mobilize. Did we take our meds? Do we have our necessary outside-the-house gear? Plus, we just move *slow*. It’s a miracle if we’re only fifteen minutes late for any given appointment. I wasn’t the issue that morning, though. I knew better than to be unprepared on game day. Nothing aggravates Henry more. 

No, there was something wrong with Grandpa. 

Mom told me he was feeling under the weather. He didn’t look sick, though. He looked vacant. Not his usual, diet-dementia aloofness, either. He looked like his soul had departed his body. His glasses had gone missing, too. 

And he was still muttering nonsense under his breath.

Our beat-up sedan lurched to a clunky stop at a red light. I racked my brain, coming up with ways I could support Henry. 

I could make sure he stays hydrated? 

The light turned green. Our car wobbled forward. 

Or maybe I'd give him permission to lie to his teammates. Henry could tell them he was late on my account. That’d be bad for me in the short term, but it’d probably be easier for him to explain than whatever the hell was going on with Grandpa...

We came to a sudden, jagged halt. 

Old coffee cups flew from their cupholders, drenching the dashboard in stagnant brown liquid as the soggy cardboard fell apart. My seat belt became rigid, biting into my chest to keep me in place. My woozy heart thundered into back of my throat.

We’d stopped at the end of a narrow, one-way street hemmed in by two monolithic brick buildings. The right bumper was tilted down, and the tire was stuck. 

Mom turned and signed: *STAY.* She stepped out to check the damage. My body trembled, nearly convulsing from the surprise of it all.

Henry grabbed my hand. 

He dragged his thumb along the underside of my wrist, slow and steady. I felt myself becoming grounded. Outside, Mom was staring at the hood, scratching the back of her head. She peered through the window and gestured:

*Pothole? Or...sinkhole? Can’t tell. It’s very deep. Stay in the car, I’m calling the police.* 

My breathing became ragged. A deluge of adrenaline flooded through my veins. 

The pressure hadn't left me.

Suddenly, it was coming back, and it was coming back different.

When Henry and I were young, before he was fed up with my existence, before he saw me as this loathsome, pitiable burden, we loved the arcade. It was a place where we were equal, despite my brokenness. Every afternoon, we would scour the house for quarters, hoping against hope we would find a cache of loose change between some couch cushions or in a pair of Grandpa’s pants. If we were successful, we’d celebrate by shaking handfuls of coins in the air, making our closed fists rattle like macarenas. 

The pressure was like *that*. 

Rapid, rhythmic clinking. 

And, God, it was pressing in on me from every direction.

Grandpa leapt from the passenger’s seat and onto the sidewalk. He twisted around in manic circles, batting at the empty air around his legs, saliva dripping down the corner of his mouth, repeating the same word so violently that even I could tell what he was saying. 

**“WORMS.”**

**“WORMS.”**

**“WORMS.”**

Henry dug his nails into my flesh.

Mom dropped the phone from her ear. She stood by the bumper, dumbstruck, panic setting in thick. Her head kept darting between the car and Grandpa. I didn’t understand. I pointed wildly towards Grandpa, desperate to focus her attention. In his frenzy, he was getting closer and closer to the end of the one-way. He was going to spill out onto the busy road, and then, who knows? The man was basically blind without his glasses. 

Why, God, *why* wasn’t she running to save him? 

Henry yanked my arm, trying to pull me towards him. 

I spun to look at him. His face was drained of color, paler than fog. His eyes were bulging from their sockets. Never in my life had I seen my brother more petrified, and he wasn’t looking out the front of the car; he was staring at something right outside *my* window. 

The clinking noise was deafening. It filled my broken ears and left room for nothing else. 

I couldn’t hear the slack-jawed, dead-eyed man, silently slamming his limp arms against the glass, one after the other, an endless, hypnotic barrage. 

And the glass was starting to splinter. 

I couldn’t move. It wasn’t just terror that rooted me to the seat. I was mesmerized by the vibrations under his skin. The flesh expanded. Spaghetti-thick cords would rise across every inch of his body. There was no order to their arrangement. They weren’t stationed in parallel or in a neat cross-stitch. They were a chaotic, tangled mess. A second later, the cords retracted, and his skin appeared normal. 

Expand. **Clink.** 

He threw his flaccid arm over his shoulder.

Retract. **Clink.** 

It fell like a meteor, helpless to gravity, and shattered the window. A hailstorm of glass engulfed me. He moved to lean his head into the car. 

Mom bounded into view and tackled him at the waist. 

The clinking ceased. 

The world was silent once more. 

I gripped the edge of the broken window and threw my head out. Glass dug into my palms, but I barely felt any pain. 

I needed to see that Mom was OK.

Relief surged out of me in a single, shaky breath.

She was kneeling on the narrow sidewalk, stunned, trembling, but intact. What was left of the man lay in front of her. 

He wasn’t dead. Dead isn’t the right word. 

The man shattered like a ceramic pot. 

The collision had tossed him into the brick wall of the nearby building, and the impact had broken him into two large pieces - one from the chest-up, the other from the waist-down. Dozens of other, smaller pieces were scattered around him: thin, rattling shards of dry human pottery.

He was empty on the inside. No guts, no blood, no heart: nothing at all. 

The worms had hollowed him out.

Mom turned, looked me in the eyes, and shot me a weak, world-weary smile. Somehow, she knew. If she stayed still, she could buy us time. She could make damn sure we got away. 

Her hands reached up to sign. 

The man’s shattered body seized. The clinking resumed with a hellish ferocity.

I couldn’t see them, but I could hear them, I could track their movements, getting closer, and closer, and closer to my Mom. Henry was behind me, reaching over my shoulder, stretching his hand out to pull her in, to keep her safe. 

I pushed him back. 

The clinking was upon her. She screamed, I think. Her mouth grew wide, her jaw became slack. They were infiltrating her. Hollowing her body until there was nothing left. 

Enough of her lingered to sign six final words.

*Take care of your brother, Felix.* 

Her fingers contorted into a bevy of unnatural, inhuman shapes. Her body went limp. 

Then, she began to pulse. 

Expand. **Clink.** 

Retract. **Clink.** 

For maybe the first time in our lives, Henry followed my lead. 

I shoved him out of the far door.

He put his arm around me, and we left.

I don’t know for sure that Grandpa’s dead, but I hope he is. 

Because if his hearts still beating, that means he’s either alone, scared, and confused, 

or hollowed out and somehow still alive. 

\- - - - -

For now, it seems like we're safe.

I was able to guide us out of town, avoiding the worms like landmines. They seem to cluster together and wait for victims, hiding in plain sight, but the only time they stop moving appears to be right before they leave or enter a host. Otherwise, they're always moving, which means I can hear them.

Everyone’s gone. The entire town is empty.

We passed by hundreds of tire-sized holes in the ground. I threw a quarter down one of them. Henry said he never heard it hit the bottom. I think the hollowed-outs slid down those holes. Don’t know where else they would’ve gone.

I don’t know why they’ve awakened from their dormancy deep within the earth, but I suppose it doesn’t matter. They’re here now. 

These things are a living paradox. 

Only the blind can see them.

Only the deaf can hear them. 

Nests of them writhed across my town's streets, through layers of salt deposited for a snowfall that never came. They clinked up a storm - twisting and squirming and tangling in on themselves - but the salt never shifted. Indirect detection doesn't seem like a viable strategy.

Want my advice? 

Hold your differently abled neighbors near and dear. 

Don’t have any?

That’s alright. 

From my perspective, you have two options.

You *could* roll the dice. Maybe this *isn’t* the beginning of some sort of worldwide annexation of the human race. Maybe my town was just very, very unlucky. 

But if you’d like to err on the safe side, might I recommend a screwdriver?

I mean, most people have a screwdriver. 

A screwdriver should be able to do the trick, no matter which way you take it. 

Blind or deaf, dealer's choice.

And if the broken are the only ones truly equipped to survive this, 

sooner or later, 

we may have to shift our perspective,

on what it means

Christmas morning arrived the way it always did in our house. Too bright, too loud, too cheerful.

I sat at the island and watched my mother move through the kitchen humming, her smile fixed and practiced, handing out mugs of coffee as if they were props in a play. My father laughed too easily, clapping me on the back, whistling some Bing Crosby tune as he walked into the kitchen. Ross sat stiffly on the arm of the couch, phone face down in his lap, while Samantha crossed and uncrossed her legs, wrapping and rewrapping her robe’s belt.

We were a family of five who knew exactly how to play pretend.

I noticed it more than ever this year. The way laughter came a second too late. The way nobody asked what time it was.

Because we all knew.

Uncle Lenny would be here soon.

Every Christmas, like a sickness that followed the calendar, Uncle Lenny showed up at our door with a crooked grin and a gift bag. He smelled faintly of cologne and cigarettes. He stayed too long. He lingered too close. He touched shoulders, wrists, backs - always just enough to remind us that he could.

And always enough to remind us what he knew.

I watched the clock tick toward noon and felt the familiar tightening in my chest. It didn’t matter that I was approaching thirty now. Uncle Lenny had a way of making time meaningless.

I looked at my father first. He was pouring a drink a little too early in the day, the ice clinking against the glass - his way of numbing the memories of a summer back when he was a teenager. The August heat. An act of horrific foul play. The long silence that followed. Uncle Lenny had been the one to grab the shovel back then, the one who said they had to stick together. Now, Dad drank to drown out the death rattle of someone taken too soon.

Mom moved around him, her smile tight as she arranged cookies on a platter. She told herself it was just a moment of weakness from a lifetime ago - a time when she felt invisible and Uncle Lenny was the only one looking. But he never let the moment die. He never said the words out loud, yet his eyes held the weight of the betrayal, looking at her not as family, but as a puppet. So she smiled, she baked, and she prayed that the secret she shared with him wouldn't tear her home apart.

On the couch, Ross sat rigid, staring at his phone but looking at nothing. He was nineteen again in his mind - confused and desperate for someone to understand him. Uncle Lenny had offered support, but it came with a price Ross was still paying. A blurred memory of his dorm room and boundaries that were pushed until they collapsed. It wasn't just a secret; it was a shame that Ross couldn’t scrub off in the shower, a stain Uncle Lenny refused to let him wash away.

And then there was Sam, wrapping her robe tighter around her waist like armor. She had been sixteen and terrified when she made the phone call. She hadn’t called our parents; Uncle Lenny answered. He had driven her there. He had paid the bill. He had held her hand while she cried, then held the photograph over her head for two decades. Every time he looked at her, Sam didn't see a loving uncle; she saw the only man who knew what she had sacrificed to keep her life on track.

The doorbell rang.

We all flinched.

Mom smoothed her hair. Dad cleared his throat. Ross shut off his phone. Sam adjusted her robe.

I stayed where I was, finishing the last sip of my coffee. I looked at my family - broken, terrified, and corrupt. They thought they were the only ones with something to hide. They were wrong.

Uncle Lenny had arrived.

And Christmas could finally begin.

What should I get rid of?,"I went through a really painful breakup and became a gym rat stereotype. Over a year and a half of lifting 4-6 days a week I got pretty built and none of my clothes except my workout clothes fit me anymore. It was time for a new wardrobe anyway because I hadn’t updated my fashion since 1998. 

What I have right now that actually fits

Shoes:

A pair of vans slip ons in teal and a pair of Chuck 70s in red. I wear those when running errands or traveling. I know they’re a little juvenile, but if I’m not on my feet for hours at a time they’re comfortable and they feel familiar to me. 

A pair of composite toe, non slip Doc Martens. Those are my work/winter weather shoes

A pair of crocs that I only wear around the house or at the lake. I have tile floors and shit gets cold in the winter. I’m not a big fan of slippers because I don’t get enough traction and become a fall risk whenever my dog decides to get a mouth full of water and spit it out somewhere random. Not getting rid of the crocs no matter what. 

30 pairs of white new balance sneakers. My dad was a bit autistic and he wanted to run an experiment to find the average walking milage a pair will last before the sole gets worn out in his beloved new balance sneakers. He died before he could actually run the experiment. Since we had the same shoe size I got them all. They’re ugly as sin, but I only wear them in the gym and they’re great for lifting and running. 

One pair of black penny loafers. I think I bought them from a 5 and dime in high school because my girlfriend told me she’d actually kill me if I wore my stinky vans to prom. They still fit and I pull them out whenever I have to wear a suit. Wicked uncomfortable though. 

Daily wear: Levi’s 501s in light blue or black or Dickies 874s in khaki. When it’s hot I wear the Wrangler flat front shorts or the Old Navy cargo shorts my dad bought in like 2006. I usually wear a plain white tee with a flannel, denim jacket, ski jacket, or windbreaker over the top, but if it’s too hot for layers I’ll go for a graphic tee from a band I used to be in or a brewery I used to work for. If I’m feeling spicy I’ll throw in a beat up old Red Sox hat and some aviator mirror shades. 

Date night/work wear: Levi’s 501s in dark blue with a cotton patterned dress shirt, the tie my boss makes me wear, and my work boots. Halfway through the date/day the sleeves get rolled up. 3/4th of the way through the day I lose the tie and the top 3 buttons if I know I won’t be running into any clients. 

Formal wear: I had a local tailor recommended to me and I’m considering going to him to get a classic black two piece, a white shirt, and a skinny black tie. I can almost squeeze into my old Men’s Warehouse suit but my shoulders feel like they might rip through the jacket if I raise my arms or stretch. 

Gym wear: Walmart brand sweat pants, a thrift store band tee cut into a bro tank, and my 30 year old bleach and coffee stained champion sweatshirt that gives me unlimited power and comfort. 

Facial hair: I do absolutely nothing to it for about a month, and then it gets itchy and oddly shaped so I just shave it clean. If the woman I’m seeing is into facial hair I do a lazy job with the electric trimmer every week so I can keep a bit of stubble

Head hair: my hair grows wicked fast and it’s very thick and very red so I like to donate my hair. Every other year on New Year’s Eve I’ll get plastered, chop off my pony tail, and have someone with steady hands shave my head. Then I do absolutely nothing to it. There’s usually a month or two where it looks awkward as hell, but after that short period I can do a middle part and tuck it behind my ears or up into a baseball cap. If my hairline starts receding or my hair growth slows down I’ll consider going to a barber and getting a real haircut. 

Underwear: Fruit of the loom boxers and Hanes no shows on the daily. Calvin Klein boxer briefs when I need the extra support or confidence boost. 

Accessories: I wear a silver stud in my left ear, most days I wear one of my multiple G Shock squares or Swatch watches. If I want to look nice I’ve got a Cadola Aviator and a Hamilton Murph 38mm. My Red Sox hat is disgusting looking with 20+ years of sun, salt, and sweat discoloring it, but my dad bought it for me the night they broke the curse in 2004 so I’m never getting rid of it. I have a few Carhartt beanies in gray and high vis yellow I wear when I have to go outside in the winter before my hair dries. Every once in a blue moon I’ll pull out my cowboy hat, bolo tie, and belt buckles. I also have a hand made leather shoulder holster for my .38 special revolver, but since I moved back to the city I don’t feel like I need to daily carry anymore. I keep my keys and wallet minimal as possible. Basic key ring with my car key, house key, bottle opener, air tag in a leather holder, gym fob, and work fob. I keep my keys latched to my belt with my great granddad’s old key safe. I always keep a small black leather notebook, a pen, and a Swiss Army knife on me. My wallet is just a generic black leather bifold. I keep my ID, emergency credit card, a picture of my late wife, and about $100 in cash in it. Everything else is in my Apple wallet or shoved into my laptop bag. 

Scents: on the daily I use the classic old spice deodorant and Bath and Body Works Coffee and Whiskey. On date nights I wear Polo classic match.

1qcvt8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShinySmileVeneers/comments/1qcvt8p/can_you_eat_with_pop_on_veneers/,Can you eat with pop on veneers?,"This question comes up in almost every thread about snap on veneer options, and honestly it was the same thing I wanted to know before I ever tried Shiny Smile Veneers. Smiling for photos is one thing, but real life includes food, coffee, talking, and long days, so the idea of wearing pop on veneers only for looks never felt practical to me.

After reading a lot of shiny smile veneers review posts and shiny smile veneers reviews Reddit discussions, the general consensus is that yes, you can eat with them, but there are a few things worth understanding first.

**What eating with pop on veneers actually feels like**

Most people describe the feeling as similar to wearing a thin retainer or aligner. You know something is there at first, but it does not feel bulky. Because snap on veneer systems like Shiny Smile Veneers are custom made from your own dental impressions, they sit more securely than cheap one size fits all trays. That custom fit is what lets many users eat normal meals without the veneers shifting around.

From what I have seen in shiny smile veneers before and after stories and user comments, things like pasta, sandwiches, eggs, rice, and even burgers are usually fine. Where people start to be more careful is with very hard foods, super sticky candy, or anything that puts a lot of pressure on the front teeth.

**Why some pop on veneers handle food better than others**

Not all pop on veneers are built the same. A big reason Shiny Smile Veneers gets mentioned so often in shiny smile veneers reviews Reddit threads is because they use dental grade materials and actual impressions. That makes a big difference. Generic snap on veneer sets you buy off the shelf tend to be thicker and looser, which is why people complain about them popping off while eating.

With a custom set, the pressure of chewing is spread more evenly across your bite, instead of pulling on one spot. That is what makes eating feel more natural.

**Does eating damage them**

This is where expectations matter. Shiny Smile Veneers are designed to handle daily wear, but they are still removable cosmetic covers. They are not crowns or implants. If you treat them carefully, they can last years. If you bite into ice, chew hard candy, or grind your teeth aggressively, you can wear them down faster.

Most shiny smile veneers review posts say that basic care makes a big difference. That means rinsing them after meals, cleaning them like you would a retainer, and taking them out at night if you tend to clench or grind.

**How much do shiny smile veneers cost compared to dentist work**

Another reason people want to eat with them is because they plan to wear them daily. The shiny smile veneers price is a fraction of traditional veneers, which often cost thousands per tooth. When you look up how much do shiny smile veneers cost, you are usually seeing a few hundred dollars for a full set.

That lower cost makes people more comfortable using them in everyday life, including meals, instead of treating them like something too fragile to touch.

**Do they change how food tastes**

This was a weird question I kept seeing, but it comes up a lot. Some users say that at first, having a layer over your teeth slightly changes how you feel textures and temperatures. After a few days, most people stop noticing. Because pop on veneers are thin and molded to your bite, they do not block your tongue or palate, which is what really affects taste.

**What people on Reddit actually say**

If you search shiny smile veneers reviews Reddit, you will see a mix of experiences. Some people eat everything with them and forget they are wearing them. Others prefer to take them out for tougher foods. That range is normal and depends on your habits, your bite, and how well your impressions were taken.

**Where to read deeper breakdowns**

If you want to see how Shiny Smile Veneers compares to other snap on veneer brands and what people say about fit, durability, and eating, there is a useful breakdown here [**https://shinysmileveneers.pickguru.blog/**](https://shinysmileveneers.pickguru.blog/) that pulls together a lot of that information.

**So can you eat with pop on veneers**

For most people, yes. Pop on veneers, especially custom ones like Shiny Smile Veneers, are made to be part of daily life, not just something you wear for photos. As long as you treat them with a little care, eating with them is not only possible, it is how most people actually use them.",1,1768416751.0,ShinySmileVeneers,0,1.0,False

Looks ok but from everything I've read it might be a fake. What stands out to me that it might be fake is the glue on white label, the ring around thew straw isn't white or has the brand on it and when you look at it sideways the hat sits pretty far up on the bear. Also...is the top squishy...like you can press the hat down with your finger? I took a bunch of pics. Would love help from the community to check if this is legit. Thanks all!

A lot of the approaches and guidelines we use surrounding Nicotine have changed in the past years, especially post-COVID, and so many people don't realize that some of the advice you may have been given previously is different now. This post is going to focus mainly on non-cigarette/non-tobacco since many people are switching from tobacco to these synthetic nicotine alternatives.

# Nicotine: Smoking vs. Vaping & Other Routes'

Smoking is the leading cause of **preventable death**, with about 480,000 Americans dying every year because first hand exposure to cigarettes ([cdc.gov](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/index.htm)). The life expectancy of smokers is about 10 years less than for nonsmokers and quitting smoking before the age of 40 reduces the risk of dying by about 90%. **1 in 5 deaths in the US are associated with smoking.**

Luckily, the rate of smoking new smokers is decreasing and more than half of smokers since 2002 have quit. Smoking rates have fallen significantly in both youths and adults. *However*, the rate of vaping is increasing, undoing much of the good work.

https://preview.redd.it/z5o3tpxc9ddg1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bc6c414d6e1adaa1d07c7721785dd3812e843ee

So this begs the question, what should clinicians do to approach smoking cessation? Frankly, the knowledge about cancer is already known--about 84% of Americans already know that smoking increases cancer risk ([hints.cancer.gov](https://hints.cancer.gov/docs/Briefs/HINTS_Brief_11_101608.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). So lectures on the potential of developing cancer mostly fall on deaf ears; cancer is some anomalous *thing* that is years away. And moreover, many people are discovering that vaping *over* smoking is safer. Yes, **vaping nicotine is objectively safer than smoking**, I would prefer people do neither but if I had to have a patient choose, vaping represents a lower all cause risk of disease.

What *is* a helpful conversation is talking about the cardiovascular risks of smoking and describing how there is risk **today**. Being safer doesn't mean risk free.

# The Risk of Nicotine Outside of Tobacco

https://preview.redd.it/me9lcm5g9ddg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ff86205ca16106a75ff2cb09732b75794631eb8

Nicotine itself is a very potent chemical for the heart and there are immediate effects on the heart that need to be accounted for. Vaping has similar (if not more when accounting for frequency of use) risk for increasing blood pressure and causing downstream heart issues like strokes, heart attacks (MI), as well as lung issues such as Asthma or COPD. One of the most helpful things I like to explain is that while you are 5-20x less likely to develop cancer while vaping, that isn't the whole story. Vaping represents the same or high risk of developing a heart condition when compared to smoking (vs. non-smokers).  In fact, for completeness, many of the same risks we see around smoking are present in smoking marijuana!

# Putting Vaping in Context

Nowadays, you ask a young person ""hey would you smoke a cigarette?"" and the majority would say ""No!"" and then retch. Take that same teen and ask if they would vape and they would say yes, describe how its cool and trendy, and shrug off the risk. So what I like to do is put vaping (and other forms of nicotine) in context of smoking.

https://preview.redd.it/l18uowji9ddg1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=451be6363fb2de90065f1b0d026ad1166a71d208

The big number I want you to remember is that 1 cigarette is 1mg of nicotine and that 1 pack (20 cigarettes) is about 20mg of nicotine. If you take some of the most popular devices out there right now and convert them to their cigarette equivalency, it really puts into perspective what the person is doing. Sure, they are puffing on a single USB stick for a couple days but how would that teen feel knowing that is 160 cigarettes worth of nicotine and would be a **2.5 packs per day smoker?** Or that a single can of Zyns is the same as using 1-1.5 packs of cigarettes?

https://preview.redd.it/bu7s743k9ddg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b36878d50dccc3f6fcd38374642d183fd2cfcadb

One of the big trends we see when people switch from cigarettes to vaping is that they use *more* nicotine than if they stuck with smoking. This is partly because vaping has fun flavors, you can do it indoors, and many of the negative social aspects are null (no smell, no teeth/clothes discoloration, etc.). That change is represents usually 10-25% *more* nicotine if vaping than smoking. So if vaping really safer? Well....no, not likely. Nicotine exposure represents cardiovascular risk and if you increase your nicotine usage by switching, then you also increase your risk.

# Methods of Nicotine Cessation - Behavior Based

Quitting smoking isn’t just about nicotine. A lot of smoking is tied to **habits, routines, emotions, and social situations**. The goal is to recognize those triggers and replace them with something healthier.

* **Pattern / Habit Triggers** *-* Morning coffee, alcohol, driving, finishing meals, or smoking after sex.
   * These are automatic behaviors, so the best strategy is to keep your body busy without thinking about it.
   * Keep your mouth occupied: gum, lozenges, lollipops, brushing teeth with extra-minty toothpaste, drinking cold water, or chewing ice can all help break the mouth-hand habit. **I personally use the minty toothpaste trick when I am craving chocolate! Works wonders**
   * Keep your hands busy: coffee stirrers, pens, stress balls, or fidget tools work surprisingly well.
   * Replace the trigger entirely when possible: avoid coffee or alcohol at first, have dessert after meals, or take a shower after sex instead of smoking.
* **Social Triggers** — *Bars, parties, concerts, seeing others smoke, smelling cigarette smoke, or smoke breaks at work.* Early on, it’s okay to avoid situations that make quitting harder.
   * Choose smoke-free environments at first (movies, shopping, libraries), and take a short walk instead of joining smoke breaks.
   * Build a support network by telling friends, family, and coworkers you’re quitting. Ask people not to smoke around you, not to invite you on smoke breaks, and not to offer you cigarettes, even “just one.”
* **Emotional Triggers** — Stress, anxiety, anger, sadness but also celebration or relaxation.
   * Smoking often becomes a coping tool for both negative and positive emotions.
   * For negative emotions, replace smoking with movement, meditation, talking with someone, or distracting activities like reading, TV, or video games.
   * For positive emotions, plan alternatives like food, snacks, or social celebration that don’t involve nicotine.
* **Withdrawal Triggers** — Cravings, missing the taste or feel of a cigarette, handling lighters or cigarettes, irritability, anxiety, low mood, or weight gain.
   * These are physical and chemical, not personal failures.
   * Nicotine replacement therapy helps here: gum, lozenges, patches, inhalers, nasal spray, and certain prescription medications can all reduce withdrawal and make quitting more tolerable.

Quit Dates:

Setting a quit date is an important step, but it does not have to be a dramatic or all-or-nothing moment. Pick a date that is realistic and not during a major stressor, trip, or life event. Give yourself time to prepare in advance by practicing the behaviors you will use after quitting, such as using nicotine replacement correctly, avoiding certain triggers, or gradually cutting back. Some people do best with a hard stop, while others succeed with a gradual reduction. Both approaches are valid. The quit date is not about being perfect. It is about creating a clear starting point so you can plan ahead, build routines, and hold yourself accountable.

Quit Apps:

Quit apps can be very helpful when trying to stop smoking, especially because cravings often come on suddenly and when you are alone. These apps can track how long you have been smoke free, how much money you have saved, and the health benefits you are already gaining, which helps keep motivation up when it drops. Many apps also include quick tools like guided breathing, short exercises, or reminders that can be used in the moment instead of reaching for a cigarette. Some allow you to log cravings and triggers over time, which makes patterns easier to recognize and plan for. Having support and reminders available on your phone at all times can make quitting feel more manageable, especially during the first few weeks.

# Methods of Nicotine Cessation - Medication Based

I wouldn't be a pharmacist if I didn't talk about the meds. Utilizing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) **doubles** quit rates over cold turkey by week 52. Likewise, combining an oral agent (gum or lozenge) with the patch has the highest success rate for NRT (NNT = 29). There is **no** increased risk of heart attack combining oral agent and patch nor **no** increased risk of heart attack if someone smokes/vapes while using the patch. Generally, most people who vape will need the highest strengths of NRT.

One of the most important things to know about nicotine gum or lozenges is **how to use them correctly**. A lot of people think these products “don’t work,” but in most cases, it’s because they’re being used the wrong way. Nicotine gum is *not* meant to be chewed like regular gum. Instead, you chew it a few times until you feel a tingling or peppery feeling, then **park it** between your cheek and gum. When the tingling fades, chew a few more times and park it again. The lozenge works the same way—let it sit and dissolve, don’t chew or suck it like candy. If you constantly chew or suck, you’ll swallow the nicotine too fast, which makes it less effective and more likely to cause side effects. I'm not going to lie: **its very hard to teach yourself this technique**. Chew chew chewing is a natural motion for us, especially with gum--try it for yourself, get a piece of gum and try to chew then park it and youll find it takes some practice!

Another helpful tip is **when to start nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)**. You don’t have to wait until your quit date. In fact, it works better if you start about **two weeks before** you plan to quit smoking or vaping. During this time, you can practice using the gum, lozenge, or patch while you’re still smoking or vaping. This helps your body and brain get used to the new routine before withdrawal symptoms begin. Many people notice they naturally start smoking or vaping less during this period because their cravings are already lower, which can be very encouraging.

It’s also important to talk about **what to expect when you quit**. Feeling irritable, anxious, or worried about weight gain is very common. In fact, weight gain is one of the top reasons people go back to smoking. There are ways to manage this, including nutrition strategies, activity planning, and sometimes medications that can help reduce weight gain and cravings. The key is to plan for these challenges ahead of time, rather than being caught off guard.

Speaking of pharma, lets compare the medications:

Varenicline (also known by the brand name Chantix) is one of the **most effective medications** available to help people quit smoking. It works especially well on its own, and it can work even better when combined with nicotine replacement products like patches, gum, or lozenges.

* That said, some people do notice side effects when they start it. The most common ones are **vivid or intense dreams** and **nausea**. The nausea usually improves on its own after the first couple of weeks. Taking the medication with food and a full glass of water can help reduce this.
* If the dreams are bothersome, there are a few simple adjustments that can help. Taking the second dose **earlier in the day**, at least six hours before bedtime, can make the dreams less intense. For some people, taking **both doses together in the morning** instead of splitting them between morning and night also works well. These changes don’t reduce how effective the medication is, but they can make it much easier to tolerate.

Another medication option is **bupropion SR** (sometimes called Zyban). This version is taken **twice a day**, which helps keep a steady level of medication in your body throughout the day. That steady level is important for controlling nicotine cravings. The once-daily version (often used for depression) doesn’t work as well for smoking cessation because the medication level drops too low between doses.

* Bupropion can be a good choice if you also have **depression**, since it can help with mood and energy. However, it’s usually **not the best option if anxiety is your main issue**, because it can sometimes make restlessness or agitation worse, especially during nicotine withdrawal.

Another option is **nortriptyline**, which works differently. Compared to bupropion, it tends to be **more calming and more sedating**, so it can be helpful if trouble sleeping is a major problem when quitting. It may also be a better fit for people whose main issue is **anxiety**, with or without depression. One downside is that it can cause **weight gain**, so that’s something to plan for ahead of time.

There is also a more “natural” option called **cytisine (or cytisinicline)**. It works in a very similar way to Chantix and has good research behind it. The main drawbacks are that the dosing schedule can be complicated and it can be expensive. Still, for people who strongly prefer a plant-based option, this is a legitimate and evidence-supported choice.

The best medication depends on your symptoms, side effects you want to avoid, and what feels realistic for you to take consistently.

I can’t shake it off. It’s strange how, even after all this time, you still manage to occupy spaces you physically never occupied. 


The smell of coffee in the morning reminds me of the mornings we spent together, your voice drifting through the air like it belonged to the silence. The kitchen towels kept as you would, the pans and cutlery too. 


The way you used to say, “We’ll figure it out,” with that smile like you had all the answers in the world still hangs like a subtitle to the silence that gets deafening otherwise. Now, I can’t stop thinking about how empty that promise feels...


You’ve become a phantom that lingers in the details of life; something I can’t touch or escape. 


And then the dreaded part of it all: I start to doubt myself. I wonder if I ever really existed to you the way you existed to me. Was I ever real to you? Or was I just a chapter in a story you already moved on from?


I used to think we were bound by something gospel that couldn’t be broken. I was so wrong and I say this, holding onto ghosts of what we were. 


It’s the little things that get to me the most.
And every day, I’m faced with something that reminds me of you. Like the first cold breeze of autumn when we used to walk through the park, our hands buried deep in our coats, and you’d complain about the cold, but I could always tell you secretly loved it..


You’re not there to complain anymore. 


And yet you’re everywhere. In the quiet. In the chaos. In the cracks of my every day existence. You’ve become something I can't ever escape, no matter how much I try. It’s not just the memory of you. It’s the fact that every single part of my life is now colored by your absence. 


I loved you more than I ever knew how to say. I trusted you with parts of me that I couldn’t even understand. And now, all I have is a reflection of us which tells me I’ve now become a stranger to myself too...

1qcvk94,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DaL0ngEgg/comments/1qcvk94/im_a_butcher_but_not_for_normal_meat/,I'm a butcher but not for 'normal' meat.,"Look, I know what you’re thinking. 'Butcher shop stories? How exciting can *that* be?' And yeah, most butchers probably talk about the price of beef or how to carve a decent brisket. Me? I got a little more *variety* in my inventory.

Welcome to 'The Primal Cut.' Where located in the strip mall in between the laundry mat and the only fire exit. But it's not your average local meat market, unless your average local meat market has a strict 'No prolonged eye contact with the Thing Not To Be Named' policy and occasionally smells like sweat, regret, and impending death. We’ve got everything from your standard Void-Fed Veal to things you wouldn’t believe. And trust me, most of those things have tried to talk to me. Usually around closing time.

You'd think dealing with cuts that moan softly when you slice them, or sausages that hum old forgotten hymns, would get to you. And sure, the first time a whole rack of ribs tried to scuttle off the counter on its own, I spilled my coffee. But after a few years? It just becomes part of the job. Another Monday, another sentient meat product trying to escape its fate as someone's dinner. You learn to appreciate the finer points, like how the Kraken Calamari tends to re-animate if you don't chop it fast enough, or how the Godless Eggs are only to be 'fried' because they literally burst into spontaneous combustion if you look at them wrong.

My name's Arthur, and I’ve seen some things. Enough things, in fact, that I figure it's time to share a few of the more memorable incidents from my tenure here. The customers, the suppliers, the meats themselves – they all have a story. And trust me, some of these stories will make you think twice about asking for 'the usual.'

And before you ask, no, our meat ‘technically’ does not contain any human. Also yes, folks have ‘died’ in the shop. Some by following the ‘Hat-Man’, who is NOT an employee by the way. Or got too close to the seafood case and got nabbed by an otherworldly tentacle that dragged them into some great beyond. It has a warning sign that says “ASK WORKER FOR ASSISTANCE"".

So, pull up a stool, try not to stare at the glowing organ meat in the display case, it will try to bargain for its freedom, and let me tell you about working at The Primal Cut. It's a job, just like any other. Except for, you know, the existential dread and the otherworldly entities that don’t like being eaten.

The back doorbell of The Primal Cut didn’t chime; it let out a low, mournful lowing sound that usually meant the delivery truck had backed over a stray soul or, more likely, Greg was early. Greg is real good stuff, he is our only delivery guy that didn’t fall into some prattling madness.

I unbolted the heavy steel door. Outside, the air smelled like sulfur and New Car Scent. Greg stood there, beaming, leaning against a truck that was vibrating at a frequency that made my teeth ache.

""Morning, Artie! Got a special one for you today,"" Greg chirped. He was wearing his usual neon-yellow safety vest and a trucker hat that said *I’d Rather Be Fishing*.

""Greg,"" I sighed, rubbing my eyes. ""It’s 6:00 AM. What’s the damage?""

""Fresh batch of 'Grade A' Slab,"" he said, hauling a heavy, wet-looking crate toward the door. The crate was etched with jagged runes and was currently leaking a thick, violet ichor. ""Local cult over on 4th Street tried a 'Great Unraveling' last night. Totally botched the summoning. They only got about forty percent of the entity through the veil before the salt circle broke, but hey, waste not want not right?.""

I peeked into the crate. The meat was pulsating. It wasn't exactly beef, but it had a marbled texture if you ignored the fact that the fat was glowing a faint, sickly green. Every few seconds, a small, vestigial eye would blink open in the muscle fiber, look at me with ancient, cosmic sorrow, and then dissolve back into the gristle.

""Dammit Greg, this is the third failed summoning this month,"" I said, poking the meat with a gloved finger. It hissed at me. ""I can't sell this as flank steak. Look at this. It’s still trying to manifest consciousness.""

""Aw, come on, Artie! It’s lean!"" Greg laughed, oblivious to the fact that the crate was starting to frost over with supernatural cold. ""Just tell the customers it’s 'dry-aged in a pocket dimension.' People love that artisanal shit. Plus, look at the color! That’s a natural violet hue you don't get with corn-fed.""

""The last time I sold 'failed deity' cuts, a guy’s grill turned into a portal and ate his patio furniture,"" I reminded him.

""User error,"" Greg waved a hand dismissively. ""You gotta sear it fast to kill the ego. Anyway, sign here. I gotta get moving.""

I signed the digital pad. Greg gave me a thumbs up, hopped into the cab of his truck—which I noticed now had several extra wheels that weren't touching the ground—and peeled out, leaving a trail of scorched pavement and the faint sound of Latin chanting in his wake.

I looked down at the crate. A small tentacle sprouted from the side of a roast, waved weakly at me, and then tucked itself back in.

""Great,"" I muttered, dragging the screaming crate toward the walk-in freezer. ""I'm gonna have to charge extra for the 'existential weight' of this one.""

I dragged it over to the heavy maple chopping block. The wood of the block is stained a dark, permanent mahogany, not just from blood, but from years of absorbing juices that aren't technically on the periodic table.

Prepping a failed summoning is a delicate process. You can’t just go at it with a standard cleaver; if you use regular stainless steel, the meat tends to ""reject"" the blade, sometimes by turning into a liquid or, in one memorable instance, by trying to fuse with the knife and becoming a very angry, sharp-edged pet.

""Alright, big guy,"" I muttered, reaching for my obsidian-edged boning knife. ""Let's keep this professional. No screaming, no shifting into a gaseous state, and absolutely no telepathic guilt-tripping.""

First, you have to find the 'Will.' In any botched eldritch entity, there’s a central knot of consciousness, usually a dense, purple cluster of nerves that thinks it’s still destined to enslave humanity. You have to excise that bit first. I poked around the pulsating slab until I felt a sharp, mental prickle in my ear, then a tiny voice shouting, *'I AM THE END OF ALL THINGS!'*

I sliced it out with a surgical flick. The knot hit the scrap bucket with a disgruntled *splat*, and the rest of the meat sighed, literally, a gust of cold air escaped the fibers and finally went limp.

Now comes the actual butchery.

The texture was weirdly fibrous, almost like a cross between A5 Wagyu and a very dense mushroom. As I sliced through the 'Grade A' Slab, the marbled green fat didn't melt; it shimmered. I had to be careful with the grain. If you cut against the grain of a multi-dimensional entity, the steaks have a habit of vibrating right off the plate once they hit room temperature.

I started portioning them out into ""Failed God Steaks.""

**The Trim:** I tossed the excess gristle into the grinder. You have to be careful with it; if you leave too much of the ""other-worldly"" bits in, the burgers tend to hum a low B-flat that attracts every stray cat within a three-mile radius.

**The Packaging:** Each steak got wrapped in double-layered butcher paper. I’ve learned the hard way that a single layer isn't enough to contain the ""being watched feeling” at the very least, it helps the customers feel safe.

**The Labeling:** I pulled out my marker and wrote *'Manager’s Special: Failed God Steaks’. Do not cook past medium-rare (for safety reasons).'*

By the time I was done, my apron was covered in that glowing violet ichor, and I had a mild headache that felt like a tiny trombone playing in my sinuses. Just a typical Monday morning.

I looked at the neat row of steaks in the display case. They looked almost normal, save for the way the light seemed to bend around them.

""Perfect,"" I said, wiping the obsidian blade. ""That’ll go great with a nice chimichurri and a complete lack of curiosity.”

I was banking on the Bilt 2.0 for that.

I am one of the high rent folks the 2.0 card will screw over. I got the card in 2023, charged rent and other bills/ subs/ planned travel expenses on rent day, with a few coffees throughout the month, and racked up the free rent points. 

Last year I finally redeemed the gravy for 2 PE tix on JAL with my partner. All my near term future travel plans involve Japan so I again was really looking forward to what 2.0 would offer and farm the JAL redemptions that were far easier, more plentiful, and less stressful than the ANA route from Amex that everyone knows about at this point.

In the end, I scored free flights to Japan just for paying rent. Amex gold will still take the majority of my non-rent spend on the next highest category: food. It was a good run gang. Drop your favorite Bilt redemption in the comments! ",6,1768416036.0,biltrewards,3,0.87,False

The fiend then left and my sister is still in it. I was talking to her about plans I had for our home country to help and volunteer, maybe opening schools and such. She then told me to meet with her mentor, in that the mentor is gonna help me with it. I was a bit skeptical at first but said why not, since I had nothing else better to do. We met at a coffee place and I told her my plans. She gave me a story about her wanting to do the same thing as well but in order to do that we would both need money(understandably so.) She then told me about her mentors(a couple) and how they retired young and they want to help others do the same. 

She then told me to read BUSINESS OF THE 21th CENTURY, and sent it through a pdf. I read the book (sadly) , but then researched more about it found out it’s used a lot in MLMs. I then found out about it being used for Amway and found more videos about others stories and obviously it seemed like a scam. So then I started questioning my sister on what exactly she was doing and how she was doing it and she just gave me the whole thing again and she basically said that when they met her. She just thought that it made sense for her to do it and doesn’t have to make sense to me,so I was questioning all her decisions at this point she then said that I don’t have to do it. I asked her if she researched about it before signing up and she said no because she believed what they said to her and it made sense to her. It’s just rubbing me the wrong way and I’m going to meet this woman again today to talk about the book and my sister just told me to ask the woman questions that I have but it just doesn’t seem right at all and I don’t know how she’s not seeing that this is wrong.

my symptoms are: sweet smelling pee, frequent-ish pee (every 1-2 hours), really thirsty and hungry all the time (especially thirsty), sometimes shaky fingers/hands, blurring vision (I have 20/20 vision normally), brain fog!!!, slow-ish healing, I'm so. tired. all. the. time. and all the symptoms get worse when I eat especially if it's something sweet

I'm ftm 19 (2,5 years on testosterone) my symptoms started (/got very noticeable) around 2 weeks ago (I may be a hypochondriac but I scheduled myself for a blood test the second day of experiencing sweet smelling piss) and the symptoms have not gotten better since

what is throwing me off is that yeasterday I got the scheduled blood sugar test done, the doctor was about to brush me off because it was in the healthy range but they lastly asked me why I wanted it tested and their eyes got Wide when I described my symptoms and told me to schedule myself for a checkup with my GP and that it sounds like diabetes. tomorrow is the checkup 

Is there anything else it can be? can it just be stress? what should I expect?

background information: I started daily exercising around 3 months ago (no change in diet, I always tried to eat healthy) in the past 3ish weeks I became too tired to exercise daily, I don't eat a lot of sugar
I don't smoke cigarettes or do nicotine in any different way, I drink a cup of coffee and a sugarless energy drink a day so a lot of caffeine ever since I was around 12 that is my most unhealthy habit,I occasionally do kratom (once every 2 weeks) but no weed

I don't have diabetes running in family, I had a really stressful (more then week long) experience around when my symptoms began that has ended since 

I take prescription Sertraline antidepressants 100mg and testosterone gel and I have asthma. prolly unrelated but I have hypermobility and I'm lactose intolerant.

It looks like Amazon Canada has a number of notable price drops happening across various departments this week. I've been keeping an eye on things, and a few particular types of items seem to be getting substantial attention.

A few examples that stood out:

*   **Kitchen Appliances:** Several coffee machines and air fryers are marked down quite a bit. These seem to be popular items that are hitting deeper discounts than usual for this time of year.
*   **Home & Cleaning:** Some high-performance vacuums are showing up with considerable price reductions. It appears to be a good opportunity if someone's been needing to upgrade their cleaning equipment.
*   **Tools & Home Improvement:** A range of tools, from power drills to hand tool sets, are also seeing notable price drops. This might be appealing for DIY enthusiasts or those looking to equip a workshop.
*   **General Home Goods:** Beyond the main categories, there are also various smaller home goods and everyday essentials that are being offered at around 40% off or more.

I've done cut and uncut salad veggies, prepared bean salad, shredded cheese, and coffee beans.

So here are the foods I'm thinking about: 
Uncut bananas and avocados that are ripe before I'm ready for them. Can I slow them down??

Tofu. I open a package but only use about 50%. Can I seal the rest for 5-7 days? 

Opened can of salmon or tuna, same problem as tofu. I'd like to have more time before I eat it again. 

Cooked brown rice. I make a large batch, refrigerate it, and eat it all week, but now I'm told that's risky. Can I seal it in meal size portions? 

Please tell me if you've tried any of these, and how they turned out. And if you have other mason genie tips and tricks i'd love to hear about them.

**SCRIPT:**

Ha! Got you. You’re not going anywhere.

*(Bedsheets. Giggling.)*

(Taunting) How do you like being pinned under me huh? How’s the view from down there?

(Rolling her eyes) Urgh. You lech!

What’s wrong, huh? Can’t breathe? (Whispering) Am I really so beautiful I stole your breath away?

Or is it just my hand choking you? (Pouting) Both, maybe?

Mmnn! I love it when you struggle. Poor baby. Just gotta get your wrists free. Just gotta shake me off!

Guess it’s hard when your girlfriend knows jiu-jitsu, huh? Are you even *trying*, babe? Or do you just like your- mmn, your place under me? (Whispering) Where you belong.

(Flirty laughter) Awww. Are you struggling to breathe? You look a bit doozy!

Doozy. Wonder if that’s an actual word. Hmm.

Oh, so dramatic! You look like you might just faint from lack of oxygen. You can’t sing my praises when you’re knocked out. (Pouty) But I’m not done strangling you yet. This is so not fair!

Mercy? That’s not my name, darling. Who’s this girl called “Mercy”? You been talking to her?

Oh, your crimes just keep piling up! Now I’m definitely choking you till lights out! (Giggling away happily)

Fine, fine. Ya little wimp! (Sighing heavily) There. No longer strangling you. Happy?

Well, you’re about to be! Come here, you.

*(SFX: Frantic rustling of bedsheets)*

Mmnnn. You feel kinda nice in my arms. You always do. Hope I’m not crushing your ribs by the way.

Can’t breathe? Of course not, silly! You’re all nuzzled into me. (Smirking) You’ve got your face completely buried in....well....

Oh, I’m not done punishing you yet. I said I’d stop choking your neck. I never said anything about letting you breathe!

(Sighing, smiling blissfully) Saying it like it’s normal? Of course I am. What you gonna do about it? Nuzzle deeper into me? (More giggles)

You wanna know why I’m punishing you? Well, you’re supposed to figure these things out on your own, you know?

You have no idea what you did wrong? (Sighing) You guys never do....

Well, darling, I think there’s a little secret you’ve been carrying around for a while now. Months, actually.

Yeah. Ring any bells?

Hmm. Here’s another hint. That “secret” is small, and shiny, and....(strangely vulnerable) and it’s really pretty. I didn’t- well, I’ve never, um....you know.

(Whispering) I didn’t think anyone would ever do this for me.

If it’s still unclear, dense as you are- (smiling) my sweet pet.....it’s something I’d- oh, I’d like that secret wrapped around my finger very, very much. And you *want* to tell me, really, but you just haven’t worked up the courage yet. Which is a shame, because....

*(Gentle squishing/ear brushing sounds. Tingly, distinctive.)*

Because I’d have said yes.

(A spell of silence)

*(Raining quietly, endlessly.)*

You know, from what our slaves tell us, this is supposed to be quite pleasurable. Euphoric, really. And I do feel you twitching. Moaning softly as you lean into me. (Pecking the nape of his neck)

But your thoughts are also sad. You’re struggling. Trying to fight me. Why’s that?

I guess it’s a bit like lucid dreaming. Hmm. Some small part of you understands what I’m doing to you, and so, muted alarm bells are going off inside your mind. You’re trying to run from me. My touch. My tentacles.

(Whispering) But my tentacles are already inside your ears.

*(Squishing/brushing)*

Oh. Liked that one, did you? Your mind is such an interesting landscape, my pet. There’s so much for me to....reshape.

Starting, from the end. You never did propose to me. Never got down on one knee, offering me that ring- your heart- those fervent eyes of yours, asking me if I’d marry you.

(Sad, quiet) You never did that. You discovered *my* secret, instead. What I’d been doing to you as you slept, cuddled up into me. And I...I was just swishing my tentacles around inside this pretty little head of yours.

I only wanted to help you sleep, you know? To protect you from those nightmares. Those bad memories. You get anxious so easily. I didn’t like seeing you troubled. And so I erased your trauma.

That is what a girlfriend does, is it not? Take care of her partner?

Do you remember what you did in response? Hm?

*(Squishing)*

You dug up all those old books and internet articles about me. What I am. You were afraid. Anxious. Jittery. You rejected me. You ran away. Like I was some kind of Lovecraftian horror. Which, well, technically-

(Sighing) My poor, poor pet. So afraid. So stupid. You thought I’d let you go? After spending years with you? Falling in love with you?

We were supposed to get married, weren’t we?

Well, we are married now. See this ring around my finger? (Smiling) You got this for me. And you proposed to me after I pinned you down on my bed. And I said yes. That, is how things happened.

*(Squishing)*

See? That memory is so vivid inside your head. You remember how pleased I was, right? If you close your eyes, you can see mine. You’ll always see my eyes in the darkness behind yours, hear my whispers inside your head, feel my arms around you. Because I am always with you. You cannot hide from me, cannot run from me, cannot resist me. All you want to do, for the rest of your life.....

....is *please* me.

Pleasing me makes you happy. Obeying me gives you pleasure. And when I praise you, for being *such* a good boy, you melt into a submissive puddle of bliss. (Whispering) You *want* to please me. It’s all you live for. And you are grateful to me, for giving you the chance.

*(Continuous squishing)*

Feel my tentacles wiggling around inside your head? Massaging your brain? Rearranging your thoughts? Feels good, doesn’t it? (Whispering) Giving up control? Surrendering? Submitting?

Remember how we met?

There’s a deserted aerodrome. It’s drizzling outside. You missed your flight, and you’re being detained because you were suspected of being a spy. You knew it was dangerous, going for a vacation in the undiscovered country. Not a place of death. No, no. It was just....off-limits for decades, even after the portals first appeared, due to....

Well, it’s not pertinent. You didn’t find out why some people never return from there. Not back then, anyway.

I was the agent assigned to your case. I took you in. It was a long, rainy ride back from the airport. I huddled next to you for warmth. And then, a sleek, sterile silver room. Nothing but a chair and a desk. And two cups of hot coffee. It wasn’t really an interrogation now was it, my love?

Hmn. Just an awkward first date. Anyway, I cleared your charges and then, a few weeks later, you ran into me at the shopping mall. Three blocks from your home. I was waiting for you to ask me out. And....after an eternity of waiting, debating, self-deprecating, (smiling) you finally did.

You see it in your mind’s eye, don’t you? The memory of my feigned surprise? That small smile on my face as you tripped over your words? And then, the warmth of my hand as I held yours- just like this- our fingers interlacing?

You see it. But that’s not what happened. Not anymore.

*(Squishing)*

You grew up on the other side. We went to the same school. I was your childhood sweetheart. Your teenage crush. The only girl you ever fell for. And it’s a shame, too, because I so enjoyed bullying you. (Softly) Just a bit. Just teasing, and getting you all blushy. But I had feelings for you the entire time. *Deep* feelings. Right when I saw you at the aero-

At the gates, on the first day of school. You looked so cute. Made me want to hide you under my tentacles and never let you out. Remember that? How I teased you years later into asking me to prom? Remember that night?

*(Squishing)*

We danced, and danced, and you stepped on my toes thrice. But it’s okay. I forgave you. And then we slipped away from the crowd, made our way to the edge of the school grounds, in a quiet, hidden corner only we knew. There were shadows and cicadas gently stirring, the spring breezes ruffling your hair. And I stole your first kiss, as the stars shined down.

I remember that night so distinctly. Don’t you, pet? It’s almost like it was....real.

Because now, it was.

We were inseparable after that. Enemies to lovers, and then, to wife and subby hubby. (Chuckling softly)

Feel that? All your old memories being overwritten? Your mind is no longer your own. It’s *my* toy, to play with as I please. Your thoughts taste delicious, as I slurp them out. Each and every one. *(* *Squishing)*

You know how it is. How each of my kind takes a slave of her own. A pleasure slave. Owned, controlled, but cared for. (Whispering) Loved.

I wasn’t sure about doing this to you. But I now see why my mother, hers before her, all of them- why they made it this way. (Whispering) You just can’t be trusted.

You run from what you can’t understand. You hurt that, which only wants to hold you close. And I am not going to allow that, pet.

(Soft, silken) You’re my property. My mindless thrall. All you can think about, is obeying me. *Pleasing* me. That’s the only thing which brings you joy. Isn’t that right?

All you want, is to be like this. Helpless, pathetic, needy. Cute. Helplessly enamoured. Serving, and worshipping, and *squirming* for me. Because that’s what you are. (Whispering) My plaything. (Pecking him, like a stamp of ownership)

You shouldn’t have let me back in. Or did you? Did I simply track you down and force my way in? It’s so foggy inside your head. Hard to remember. It probably doesn’t matter. Do you know why?

(Pouting) Of course you don’t. Silly boy. I’ve stolen all your IQ points. Poor, punished *pet.* (Laughing)

I never left. (Softly) I was always here.

Where is here? Hm. What a curious thought. *(Squishing)* Oh well, looks like this tentacle slurped that out too.

It doesn’t matter, my love. There’s just rain outside this window. Just rain falling from a yellow-grey sky. Murky opalescence. You’re never leaving this room without me. Going outside alone could....damage your frail psyche.

(Pouty, babying him) Besides, you don’t like being apart from me, do you? No. Of course not. You need me to protect you from all the strange and confusing things out there. You just want me to cuddle you and give you my attention. Don’t you? (Pecking him) My sweet, sweet pet.

“Please”? Please *what,* darling?

No. I won’t release you. It’s like I said, (whispering) I’m not done punishing you yet.

You rejected me. Ran from me. I’m still mad at you. But not in a, like, a livid or furious kinda way. More of a- rolling my eyes, sighing, “Well, this is just what I have to do” kind of way. (Sighing) Do you get me?

Come now, pet. Don’t lie to yourself. After you found out, you did a lot of thinking. There’s a thought you’ve kept hidden deep, deep below the surface since then.

You wondered, briefly, what it’d be like to be my thrall. To be so hopelessly enchanted, *conditioned*, into obedience and servitude. There’s a part of you that, (whispering) reacted to it. Am I wrong?

Well, that fantasy of yours is coming true. I wanted you to be my equal, even if you’re only human. I treated you with love, trust and respect. Now I’ve lost two of those things for you. (Softly) So I think I’ll just keep you as my slave. For many ages, many epochs, many eternities. Maybe forever. After all, time has little meaning here.

Don’t worry. You’ll love it. Why, you already are!

*(Squishing)*

Obeying me gives you pleasure. It gives you those happy little tingles. And when you obey, you get praises. And cuddles. All thoughts, all worries, all resistance absorbed and drained by my tentacles.

Oh, pet. Does that feel good? Your eyes have rolled back. You seem quite happy right now. Tell the truth. (Softly) You missed me, did you not?

Yeah?

Good boy. See? Honesty brings rewards. Do you feel that tentacle patting your head? (Smiling) My girls are quite fond of you, you know?

*Melt* for me, pet.

(Whispering) Obey. Submit. You can’t do anything, but obey.

*Melt* for me.

That’s a good slave. Go on then. Kiss me.

Yes. Over there.

(Sighing softly) This feels familiar.

My good boy. I missed you so, so much.

Look at you. So obedient, so eager to please. Such love for me in your eyes, like I’m the centre of your universe. Which, well- (giggling happily)

Hey. I don’t think this is a bad way of securing your commitment, you know? After all, (smiling at the ring on her finger) we’re married. So, I get to keep you forever, right?

(Muttering softly) That’s how marriages work, I think. Hmmn.

Come here, pet. Let me hold you.

(Breathing gently, up close) Good boy. I’ve got you. You’re safe in my arms. My sweet, perfect pet. (Kissing his cheek)

I’m still mad at you for breaking my heart, but we can work on that. You are mine again, so....everything’s just fine. (Whispering) My treasure is safe with me. And I’m never letting go. So you don’t have to be afraid or sad anymore.

I’m going to take care of you, the way I always have. And you know why that is.

(Smiling) Yes. That’s right, my pet.

Mistress loves you very, very much.

I’m a sophomore, and I’m studying psychology in hopes of becoming a therapist. I’m doing good in my classes, deans list, and ahead of my recommended path. I work a research job and I also work at a coffee shop. I’m extremely grateful and privileged because my parents help out with my housing, I have scholarships that cover tuition and anything else i could need. I don’t need to work but I believe it’s important that I do, and learn to start saving which has been going well!

I have a boyfriend who’s my best friend and honestly the only constant feeling of good in my life. All my friends live far away, but I’m not super social so it’s ok. That’s not what feels wrong or missing

I recently feel like I’ve entered a season of change. I cut off alot of my hair (it looks fine but I don’t really like it ☹️), I got tiny tattoos I’ve been dreaming of for a long time. A lot of good has been happening! But I feel like I’m wasting time and I’m missing something. 

Part of it is this coffee shop. I really freaking liked it the first three months, and I’m approaching 6 and I’m starting to get tired of it. I’m constantly approached by men, constantly berated because I’m young, female, and a person of color. It gets so tiring to do an 8 hour shift in between two classes and to feel so emotionally drained too. It doesn’t relate to what I want to do, what I want to be. So I started researching and applying to internships that I want to do! That’s been exciting but I’m so overwhelmed with this feeling of “you’re behind, you’re not supposed to be here”, that I keep having this thought like “quit right now”. Then the only coworker I genuinely love and connect with has put in her two weeks. It breaks my heart :(

I also have started this obsession with getting a pet. I want a dog so freaking bad. I fostered one but it went really badly in two days and had to bring him back, which crushed me. ☹️. And now I’ve moved on to really wanting a cat. And I’ve always had a passion for animals, a very deep one, but this feels related to this feeling of “you need to change”. I keep asking myself “what is this need you’re trying to fill” but I can’t find it. It’s making me really really anxious.

1qcvcr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qcvcr1/grind_size_issues_baratza_encore_esp/,Grind Size Issues [Baratza Encore ESP],"Hello all,

I recently got my sister a Breville Bambino for her first espresso machine. I also gave her my very gently used Encore ESP as her grinder. Keep in mind when I bought the ESP I was only doing pour over until I upgraded to a ZP6 pretty quickly.

That out of the way, I’m finding that the grind size settings are extremely fickle on this thing. Setting 10 the machine is choking. 15, it’s choking but slightly less. 20 the shot is flying out like a super soaker. Granted, there is a chance I accidentally went to 21, but again shouldn’t matter that much.

Now I’m not a professional, but I can pull a decent shot on my Breville Barista Pro, using the built in grinder. I’m usually between 7-12 depending on the bean. Anyway, just as a test I ground some coffee at home on the pro and popped it in her Bambino and it was 18in 36out in 29sec, same as on my pro. Can the Encore ESP really be that drastically different between 5 clicks?",1,1768415758.0,espresso,4,1.0,False
1qcvcqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qcvcqr/how_to_stop_wasting_time_on_useless_videos_the/,# How to Stop Wasting Time on Useless Videos: The Science-Based Playbook That ACTUALLY Works,"I spent 6 months researching this because I was tired of ""just delete the apps bro"" advice that ignores why we're actually glued to screens in the first place.

Here's the thing nobody talks about. Your brain isn't broken. Social media platforms literally employ neuroscientists and behavioral psychologists to make their apps as addictive as slot machines. TikTok's algorithm is so sophisticated it knows what will hook you before you do. YouTube's autoplay feature isn't a convenience, it's a retention strategy that exploits your brain's tendency to follow the path of least resistance. Instagram's infinite scroll removes natural stopping points that used to exist when we'd reach the end of a magazine or TV show.

The average person touches their phone 2,617 times per day according to research from dscout. That's not because you lack willpower. It's because billion dollar companies have gamified human psychology. But here's what I learned from deep diving into behavioral science research, neuroscience books, and talking to people who've actually broken free: you can rewire this.

## 1. understand the dopamine trap you're actually in

Dr. Anna Lembke's book ""Dopamine Nation"" completely changed how I see this. She's a Stanford psychiatry professor and addiction specialist who explains that our brains are designed for a world of scarcity, not abundance. When you get that hit from a funny video or scroll past something shocking, your brain releases dopamine. But here's the cruel part: your brain immediately counters with an equal opposite force to restore balance. So you end up in a deficit, craving more.

Every time you watch a useless video, you're essentially taking out a loan against your future motivation. The more you binge, the more you need just to feel normal. This book is insanely good at explaining why ""just one more video"" always turns into 3 hours. Lembke provides a 30 day dopamine reset protocol that actually works because it's based on neuroscience, not motivation porn.

## 2. replace the void before you create it

Most advice tells you to ""just stop"" watching videos. That's like telling someone to stop breathing. Your brain seeks stimulation, that's literally what it's designed to do. The trick isn't elimination, it's redirection.

I started using an app called Ash for this exact reason. It's like having a pocket therapist who helps you identify what emotional need you're actually trying to fill when you reach for your phone. Usually it's not entertainment, it's avoiding discomfort or filling social voids. The app sends you better alternatives based on what you're actually feeling. Way more useful than another screen time tracker that just makes you feel guilty.

Research from Dr. Judson Brewer at Brown University shows that curiosity is more effective than willpower for breaking habits. His book ""Unwinding Anxiety"" teaches you to get curious about what reward you're actually getting from mindless scrolling. Spoiler: the reward is usually temporary relief from boredom or anxiety, not actual joy. Once you see that clearly, the behavior loses its grip. The book has specific exercises that make this click in your brain, not just as a concept but as a felt experience.

## 3. make it annoying to waste time

Friction is your friend. I moved all social media apps into a folder on the third page of my phone. Sounds stupid but that extra 2 seconds of effort creates a pause where your conscious brain can intervene.

Better yet, use the Intention app. Before it lets you open TikTok or YouTube, it forces you to type out why you're opening it. You have to literally write ""I want to waste time"" or ""I'm bored"" before it unlocks. That moment of honesty is enough to make you reconsider about 60% of the time.

The productivity researcher Cal Newport talks about this in ""Digital Minimalism"". He's a computer science professor at Georgetown who studied how the Amish adopt technology, they're selective, not reactive. They ask whether each tool serves their values before letting it into their lives. The book walks you through a 30 day digital declutter that helps you rebuild your relationship with technology from scratch. This is the best book on intentional tech use I've ever read, hands down.

## 4. find something that actually fulfills you

You're not going to stop watching useless videos by sheer force of will. You'll stop when you find something better. That's just how human motivation works.

I picked up reading again using the Feeeed app. It curates long form articles and book excerpts based on your interests, but here's why it works: each piece takes 10-20 minutes to read. Long enough that you can't just mindlessly consume 47 in a row like TikToks, but short enough that you can finish during a coffee break. Your brain starts associating reading with completion and actual learning, not just infinite scrolling.

BeFreed is an AI learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans around whatever you want to improve. Built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers, it lets you customize everything, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with detailed examples.

The learning plan adapts based on your progress and what you highlight. There's also a virtual coach named Freedia you can chat with about your struggles or ask for recommendations. The voice options are legitimately addictive, including a deep, smoky tone similar to Samantha from Her, plus sarcastic and energetic styles depending on your mood. Since most listening happens during commutes or workouts, having a voice that doesn't bore you makes a huge difference in sticking with it.

For podcasts, anything by Huberman Lab will keep you hooked. Andrew Huberman is a Stanford neuroscience professor who breaks down how your brain actually works. His episode on dopamine and motivation is 2 hours but explains exactly why you're stuck in these patterns and what protocols actually change them. The Tim Ferriss Show is also solid for this, he interviews world class performers about their systems and routines.

## 5. build incompatible habits

James Clear's ""Atomic Habits"" has this concept called habit stacking that's stupidly effective. You attach a new habit to an existing one. Every time I make coffee now, I open Kindle instead of Instagram. The coffee becomes the trigger.

But here's the key: make your new habit incompatible with the old one. I started going to the gym right after work because I physically can't scroll on my phone while lifting weights. I started meeting friends for walks because you can't properly doom scroll while walking and talking. Find activities that make phone use literally impossible.

## 6. use your watch history as data not shame

Go look at your YouTube watch history right now. See how much time you spent on videos titled ""why you're lazy"" or ""how to be disciplined"". You're watching content about self improvement instead of actually improving. That's the trap.

The book ""Indistractable"" by Nir Eyal (who literally wrote the book on how to make apps addictive before feeling guilty about it) explains this perfectly. He says you need to identify the internal trigger, the uncomfortable feeling you're trying to escape. For most people it's anxiety about work, loneliness, or feeling inadequate. Videos provide temporary relief but make the root cause worse.

Eyal's framework involves scheduling your day in advance with timeboxing. Not because you'll stick to it perfectly, but because you'll see exactly when and why you go off track. That awareness is what creates change, not another motivational video.

## 7. accept that you'll relapse and plan for it

You're going to fall back into old patterns sometimes. That's normal. The difference between people who change and people who don't isn't that they never mess up, it's that they don't let one bad day become a bad week.

I keep a note on my phone that says ""You're not watching for enjoyment, you're watching to avoid something"". Reading that after I've already wasted 30 minutes helps me stop at 30 instead of going to 3 hours.

The Finch app gamifies habit building in a way that actually works for ADHD brains or anyone who struggles with consistency. You take care of a little bird by completing daily self care tasks. Sounds childish but the dopamine hit from watching your bird grow is weirdly more satisfying than another youtube video, and it's actually building positive habits.

Look, I'm not gonna pretend I never watch useless videos anymore. But I went from 4+ hours daily to maybe 30 minutes, and it's usually intentional now. The shift happened when I stopped trying to rely on willpower and started understanding the actual mechanisms driving the behavior.

Your attention is the most valuable resource you have. Every tech company knows this. It's time you started treating it that way too.",1,1768415757.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

The coffee is great, too (High Noon Coffee Roasters - from Asheville)! The cafe is kind of hidden, off Tunnel Road on Kenilworth Knoll, and I feel like not enough people are aware of it, which is why i felt compelled to light the beacon on this place that jas grown so dear to me in such a short time. I think there are enough starbucks and other big corporations around, so when a local spot really shines, I try to sing my praises. 
  
I also just found out that the cafe is also a nonprofit, so donations can be a tax write off for anyone who might be interested in such things. I hate to see this place so empty, and if anyone ever wants to work on art in a safe and welcoming space, this is a good option!

1qcvb09,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1qcvb09/seeking_understanding/,Seeking understanding,"Hi everyone. I've been lurking here for some time now (and now on a burner, lol), I know there's a lot of posts of troubles and I hate to add to that, but I think I just really need to feel like someone is out there who understands the emotions of where I'm at right now. It's been an occasionally bumpy road with my nesting partner, Aspen (TF 29) and I (NB 27) in the process of exploring ENM/poly dynamics. I'm open to any advice that may pop up.

Aspen and I have been together for 5 years- and only actively started pursuing poly about a year and a half ago. Throughout our relationship before that, we both had made comments of feeling like we had the capacity for it and would like to explore it, but it wasn't until June 2024 that we decided to jump in. And jump in is really the best term- we did not do the amount of research we should've, or had the conversations necessary before starting. It was a ""when something comes up, we'll talk"" mentality. 

Of course doing that, feelings got hurt quickly- on my side. We pushed on despite this which was again, not smart. I think for me, I was afraid of not getting to experience anything myself if we shut it down to reassess. For Aspen, there wasn't ever any negative feelings brought on by my explorations, so she struggles to feel empathy for me currently. There's sympathy, but no empathy. 

By happenstance, we ended up having dates with new people on the same night, where they both progressed into relationships. It was a very weird, serendipity event that created a very strong feeling of ""togetherness"" for me in this experience. 

But, we weren't doing check ins for things between us, or discussing these relationships outside of ""going out x night."" Finding out about status changes was a mention in passing. The few times something did affect me to the point of wanting discussion, the conversations caused Aspen to feel attacked, and she would shut down. We fell into a pretty parallel dynamic for our other relationships because of this and this meta not treating me with a lot of respect. Neither of us pushed it, it worked well enough.

Without getting into specifics, our other relationships also ended within a week and a half of each other (this was in early-mid December). Again, it reinforced a ""together"" feeling but it was shattered pretty quickly. Within the same timeframe, Aspen and an acquaintance of ours (Spruce F30s?) from our local political group decided to go on a date to test the waters after seeing each other on Hinge. There was incredibly poor communication between Aspen and I about this. The framing of the date in the days prior made it sound like a platonic coffee, and while a few months prior Aspen had made comments about finding Spruce attractive, it didn't come across as her wanting to explore something with Spruce- and it being so long prior that she told me that it wasn't on my mind.

When the day of the date occurred, a few hours in (and long after coffee) Aspen texted me an offhanded comment about talking about me a lot and mentioned it being a romantic date. I then tried to give space for her to have that time, and tried to not bug her outside of alerting her when I was laying down for bed and asking if she was coming home that night (in which she told me yes) and mentioning that I felt like there was a lack of communication happening. In the end, what was expressed to me as a small coffee date turned into her not coming home until the next morning, and also never communicating with me about that progression.

It was the breaking point for me, that how we were doing everything did not work. That I wasn't ready for something to progress with someone already in our lives because I didn't feel ready for a dynamic more than parallel after the last experience with a meta. That there wasn't enough communication, or time spent together that was dedicated. I never fully worked through the emotions of the initial hurt feelings from the first few days of us opening our relationship, and the way this new connection started had some parallels for me that were causing big reactions for me.

We've had a lot of long, overwhelming conversations in the month since. There has been a lot of progress in opening up to each other, actually processing things together, but it's still very much in the early stages. We've started couples therapy, but it's only been three sessions so far and still very much in the stage of ""where are we now."" I know its going to be a stormy trip ahead, and I'm not going to give up on going through it, but I'm exhausted from being in constant fight or flight, and feeling so alone in this. 

The real kicker for me was that Aspen prioritized exploring her new connection with Spruce. (Granted, I know if she was asked, she wouldn't say that she did.) I told her I didn't want to ask her to close while we sorted our problems out, that I didn't want to take away her agency in that choice. But that if we didn't, this was going to be a harder, longer thing for me to work through. And she chose to not, and I can't fault her for that. I just feel rejected- in all of our talks in December she always stated that her priority was her preexisting relationships, and she always listed myself and old meta (prior to break up) by name for that. One of the conversations, (two weeks into this new connection with Spruce) she again stated that our relationship was her priority and that she wasn't entertaining anything new and romantic while we worked through things. Some possible plans between Aspen, Spruce, Spruce's husband, and I had been mentioned and I was resistant, but hearing that ""nothing romantic would start right now"" made me feel like I could maybe do those plans as an olive branch, and said so. I got quickly told that Aspen had not, and would not, close off anything romantic with Spruce. I told her that that wasn't how she expressed things to me, and she said that she thought she was explicit about it and I was the one that misunderstood.

This largely hurt because in these same conversations, Aspen commonly told me how ""Spruce understands what we're going through- they and Husband have had to close their relationship a few times to work on things. They get it."" And it just feels like a slap in the face. Aspen has told me that she hasn't given any specific details of our current problems, but it feels like my dirty laundry is being aired out to someone I don't know (I know that's ironic, me coming to reddit, but I did ask Aspen if I could post here for perspective), I felt somewhat misled in the other things said, and on top of it, being told that Spruce understands if we needed to work on things with no external pressures but that it wasn't going to happen.

Clearly, communication is the basis of a lot of what we're trying to work through. We have a lot of occurrences of Aspen saying something, thinking she's being direct and explaining herself to her full capabilities, and me understanding it in a different way that also feels clear so I don't ask for clarification and end up with hurt feelings or misunderstanding after the fact. I know that the two of us value each other and our relationship enough to work through this and find resolution, but I struggle with knowing I can't move through this at a pace that would make her happy.

This past weekend, things with Aspen and Spruce went official, and I know Aspen is a bit upset that I'm not happy for her. Not to the point of telling me so, but it's definitely an elephant in the room right now. I want to be happy for her, I am glad she is having a positive new relationship after learning how the last one was actually pretty negative for her, but I can't offer the level of compersion she's seeking right now. The fact that it is with this person who feels so related to my current rock bottom- one that I can't seem to find any footing to crawl out of at this early stage- is too much for me to overcome in this moment.

I just feel so alone in this- there's no one in my life I can talk to about this besides Aspen and my therapists. As I said earlier, while Aspen has a ton of sympathy and has been hearing me out at every opportunity, there's no understanding of the emotions I'm having. I don't have a large social circle, our ex-roommate was the one person I felt like I could express some of these emotions to, and over the summer he ended our friendship and moved across the country.  I don't have any friends who are poly outside of one couple that lives a few hours away- a couple that wanted to explore things with Aspen and I, but we didn't had capacity for a long distance dynamic and it didn't progress, so I feel strange going to them to talk about these things. 

I just want to feel more than just heard- like someone understands deeper than that. Thank you for reading <3

Also I have to mention that I had terrible concussion. And both things was helpful for me so much. Microdosing of shrooms decreased panic attacks after my concussion. ISRIB-A15 gave me cognitive clarity and took my brain functions back to normal. And through some period of time I tried stacking these things.

The Ohio State University
January 2, 2026

By Victor Shelton, Retired NRCS Agronomist/Grazing Specialist

After nearly two decades of writing Grazing Bites, one thing remains consistent: no two years are the same. Rainfall, temperatures, and growing conditions can swing dramatically from one part of Indiana to another—not to mention across the rest of the Midwest. Because of that variability, the most dependable management strategies are the ones that function well regardless of weather. January is the month to revisit those principles, tighten the plan, and begin the year on solid footing.

A grazing plan is only as strong as the goals behind it. Winter offers the clearest mental space for honest assessment of the herd, the land and one’s time. It invites you to sit down with a notebook, a cup of coffee and the experiences of the past season to ask realistic questions. What needs improvement this year—soil health, animal performance, pasture recovery, weed pressure and/or feed efficiency? Where did pressure show up last year — short forage, parasite challenges, worn-out fencing, and/or too much mud in high-use areas? Which changes are achievable — adding a cross fence, improving water access, moving livestock more frequently and/or adding warm-season grasses?

Effective goals should be specific and measurable, not vague intentions such as “graze better” or “get ahead of weeds.” Beneficial goals sound more like maintaining a minimum four-inch residual on cool-season pastures, rotating every three-to-five days insxtead of every seven-to-ten, establishing a set number of warm-season forage acres or reducing purchased feed by a realistic percentage. Goals like these guide daily decisions, and daily decisions are what ultimately build resilient systems. January is an appropriate time to refine those intentions into something workable.

Winter is also an ideal time for a pasture inventory. With vegetation dormant, the landscape is easier to read.  Areas that were grazed too tightly, too frequently or too conveniently stand out clearly. Bare spots, heavy-use areas, thin stands, and paddocks that consistently received excess pressure are more visible now than during the growing season. Low-fertility zones, compaction, erosion, broomsedge patches and water access issues are easier to identify.  Even in dormancy, tools such as the Pasture Condition Scoresheet (PCS) can be useful. While a full assessment is best completed during active growth, using the PCS in winter helps highlight trends, flag paddocks that need attention, and establish a baseline for spring decisions. This is not the month for fixing everything, but it is the month for understanding what will require attention when growth resumes.

This is also a good time to update soil tests, especially if more than four years have passed since the last sampling. Soil tests help prevent major missteps and indicate whether fertility is improving, declining, or holding steady. They can identify fields that would benefit from lime or a modest, targeted nutrient input.  Winter visibility also makes it easier to evaluate fencing, while water lines and troughs deserve attention as slow leaks and frost-related issues tend to reveal themselves now.

Regardless of how any year unfolds, one principle remains constant: plants need rest. More rest leads to deeper roots, greater forage production, improved resilience, and fewer weeds. Weather may influence how long rest periods need to be, but a grazing system should be designed to allow adequate recovery under any conditions. January is the time to ask whether paddock size and layout truly support rest, if water placement allows consistent rotation and reasonable walking distances, whether stocking rate or stock density needs adjustment and which paddocks should receive priority for longer recovery when spring arrives.

If the year turns wet, rest protects soil structure. If it turns dry, rest protects roots. If it turns average, rest usually results in more forage than expected. Rest is one of the few management tools that never backfires.

Soil health forms the foundation for productive grazing, and winter often reveals its condition more clearly than summer. Healthy soils respond to consistent habits: keeping living roots as long as possible, maintaining soil cover with residue, promoting plant diversity, minimizing disturbance, and managing stock density with intention. Even dormant roots support early spring biological activity.  Residue reduces erosion and moderates soil temperature swings. Soil under stockpiled forage is often warmer and less deeply frozen than soil in overly grazed areas with little cover, primarily because standing forage and sod insulate the soil and slow heat loss, while microbial activity continues at a reduced rate through winter. Diversity improves resilience and forage distribution, and thoughtful stock density helps limit selective grazing and encourage more uniform use.

Animal performance improves when pastures are in balance. Nutrition gaps, parasite pressure, and inconsistent gains are frequently tied less to supplements or dewormers and more to forage quality, quantity and recovery time. Livestock perform best when rotations provide a clean grazing horizon and when forage is neither too short nor overly mature. Integrated parasite management consistently outperforms calendar-based deworming. Regular rotation reduces exposure, maintaining adequate sward height keeps animals away from larval zones and selecting animals that tolerate parasite pressure strengthens the herd or flock over time.

Monitoring body condition through winter is also important. Losses can be difficult to detect under winter hair or wool, and small declines now often surface later as reduced conception rates or slower recovery once grass begins growing.

Through all of this, simplicity remains a strength. The temptation is either to overhaul the entire operation or to change nothing at all. Yet the grazing principles that worked decades ago remain sound today: maintain adequate residual, protect the soil with residue, match stocking rate to forage supply, keep animals moving, promote diversity, avoid overgrazing and observe the land closely. Reliable water access, functional fencing, balanced stocking rates and livestock suited to their environment matter far more than the latest gadget or formula. Grazing remains both art and science — observant, flexible and grounded in fundamentals.

It requires clear reflection and a willingness to make a few well-chosen adjustments that will pay dividends throughout the year. With refined goals and a strengthened system, the 2026 grazing season can begin on firm ground, regardless of what follows. It is not about maximizing a single grazing event but about optimizing the entire grazing season. Keep on grazing!

We’ve been conditioned to believe that ""having faith"" is a noble pursuit, rather than what it actually is: a refusal to engage with the uncomfortable mystery of reality. This cultural installation is so deep that we don’t even notice when it’s running in the background.

You see it in the mundane theater of the morning commute. The man screaming at the bumper of a stranger isn’t just angry about a lane change: he is momentarily convinced that his time, his path, and his ""right of way"" are cosmically significant. It is a miniature ""stately delusion."" In that moment, his philosophy is empty; he has become the very thing he critiques, a person blinded by the self-serving hallucinations of his own importance.

This is the poison of the ""faith as virtue"" narrative. It tells us that believing in our own righteousness is enough to make it true. It’s the ""spiritual quackery"" of the modern age: the idea that if we just ""manifest"" or ""trust the process,"" we are absolved from the rigorous work of self-examination.

But true integrity isn't found in a quote on a coffee mug or a sermon from a soapbox: it’s found in the silent choice to remain decent when no one is looking, and when there is no ""celestial bribe"" to be won. If we are our actions, then every reflexive outburst and every unearned certainty is an indicator of the ""sectarian grooming"" we have yet to dismantle.

I wanted to come on here and thank every single one of you guys. Without this community, I never would've made the push for recovery. I woke up this morning and there was blood on my liner, and then it's a little later now and I have an even heavier flow. I have cramps as I'm writing this and it's the best feeling in the world. I'll give a little context on my journey with HA and recovery now. I want to preface this by saying that I'm 17 (turning 18 in a couple weeks), so I'm not an expert in this regard by any means! I just wanted to provide support to those going through the recovery process, especially the younger teenagers. 

I lost my period back in April 2024 due to heavy restriction, stress, and overall health issues. I'm not gonna say any numbers, but I lost a lot of weight and kept it off for a year. I was absolutely miserable.

Although I felt (somewhat) okay, I knew it wasn't sustainable. My heart rate was dropping below 30 constantly and my blood pressure was in the trenches. I took this as a sign of “being healthy”, but I was far from it. My skin was lifeless, my hair was falling out in clumps, and I couldn't concentrate or sleep. I would wake up in the middle of the night starving, the extreme hunger was absolutely awful. My cortisol levels must’ve been through the roof. I was a shell of the person I was.  I was in quasi-recovery for 2 months before I decided to commit to recovery in August ‘25. I couldn’t stand it anymore. 

Recovery: 

After that, I decided to listen to my body. I didn’t count calories at all and it was so difficult. However, I made a commitment to myself that I wanted my period back in the next year. Somethings I did

	•	I ate when I was hungry, and continued eating even when I wasn’t. I paid attention to my hunger cues and tried to include an equal portion of carbs, fats, and protein. I used to be obsessed only protein intake, so this part was especially difficult for me. the food noise reduced significantly after about 2 months of this! 

	•	I never cut out caffeine. I’m drinking my morning coffee as we speak! however, eating before caffeine is crucial. Also, don’t use it as a way to suppress your appetite. I love Coke Zero, but I always drank it during or after a meal. 

	•	I tried to eat within the first hour of waking up. Of course this didn’t always happen, but I tried to make it a priority when I could! If I wasn’t hungry in the morning, I’d just wait until I was. Really listening to your body is crucial during this!!

	•	I cut out excessive cardio. I saw the most progress after I stopped walking on the treadmill everyday. I still exercised / did cardio occasionally! however, I never pushed it. 

	•	No food off limits. I ate relatively Whole Foods, but I never skipped out on ice cream with my family. Your body is so smart. It’ll tell you what it needs and how much of it. I absolutely love avacado toast with a sunny side up egg or yogurt bowls with fruit and peanut butter! I recently discovered how much I love nuts again!! I’ve been able to eat birthday cake and laugh with family instead of worrying about the calories. It’s been such a blessing to eat whatever I want without guilt!

	•	Rest!!!!! Please try to sleep at least 7 hours. I know it’s rather difficult, but it’s been such a game changer. 

Things I noticed right before getting my period.

	•	My mood was changing constantly. I was incredibly happy one minute, and the on the verge of bawling my eyes out the next. I’ve overall been a lot happier these past couple months!

	•	Libido / Clear cervical mucus increased SOOO MUCH. This might be a little tmi, but it was so dry. About 3 months ago is when I started noticing the increase in both. 

	•	SO MUCH ACNE. Forehead and back acne especially. I felt like I was 13 again with how much there was. My skin was also a lot more oily. 

	•	Heat flashes. I was freezing and sweating at the same time. 

	•	Those ghost cramps were killer. I got them months leading up to today. I genuinely thought I got my period several times before I actually did. 

	•	A lot of appetite fluctuations. I was ravenous one day, and the next I couldn’t stand the thought of food. Trust your body and the process!!

	•	My hair, skin, and nails are so much healthier and stronger. My family tells me that I have my glow back. My cheeks actually have color now. My hair isn’t falling out as badly anymore!!! My nails aren’t breaking off. Overall, my appearance has improved significantly!!! 

Body changes: 

Now, I wanted to have a separate section just for this. My body changing was one of the most difficult parts of this process. As a woman, I was so attached the idea of my body staying as small as possible. I’ve never wanted kids, and I used that as an excuse to brush off my HA. I had to let go of the only thing I felt I had control over. My stomach was bloated, I had to increase bra sizes, and my jeans didn’t fit anymore. I was incredibly uncomfortable, but I had to remind myself that I wanted to live longer. I wanted to have healthy bones. I wanted to travel the world and have a life bigger than my fears of my body.

I reframed my thoughts a lot. I thought back to my loved ones. If someone asked me why I loved them, would I say their body or their weight? Absolutely not. It doesn’t even cross my mind. So why would other people care about yours? If they do, do you really want people like that in your life? I don’t. 

None of this happened overnight. It took so long just to come to terms how much I was harming myself. I’m always here for you guys to answer any questions and I’m so sorry for the long post!!!

Wednesday morning I switched to coffee, I'm not a coffee person, dont crucify me for that lol, worked okay but my stomach felt awful by the afternoon.

Thursday I tried gum, chewbizz, that someone on my team recommended, it's got a nicotine analog thing in it plus some vitamins, works more gradually than caffeine, kept me focused for the long haul without the jitters or the crash, but went though like 2 gums. Friday I tried caffeine gum which I bought months ago and never used, can’t remember the name sorry, honestly not bad, I liked being able to control the dosage better than with drinks, but the focus it gave me felt kind of scattered and I was still dealing with jitters.

Officially it was respiratory failure caused by pneumonia, but he had a bad fall in December fracturing his neck, survived the surgery, but didn’t survive the lung infection to follow. I stayed with him so many nights in the hospital chair, and stayed up all night with him on his last night here. As much as he was fighting, his body just couldn’t take it anymore and comfort care took him quickly. Monday was unequivocally the worst day of my life. 

My dad was the ultimate man in my corner. My cement backstop, my rock and biggest supporter. He was my #1 dance partner, best jokester, my best friend and my little buddy all over town. I will miss sharing fish and chips with him at the beach, morning coffee hugs (when I would appear he would say “ohhh the sun is out!”) and watching him eat whatever baked goods I would make especially for him. I miss watching him eat strawberry ice cream straight out of the tub and leaving the spoon in there when he put it back in the freezer. We loved each other so much.

It works like this, you have to divide your day into three layers:-

i go to class, live my life, and let the info fade a bit. this ""forgetting"" is actually important.


layer 3: night revision
before bed, i do not open the textbook. Just try to recall what I learned in morning, opening the book don't benefit.
i force myself to take a quiz on what i read in the morning. And if I forget something then I open book and just take a look at it.

honestly, writing quizzes for myself was the annoying part and time consuming. i started using an ai tool (Neurospark AI) to just scan my morning notes and generate the quiz for me while i do other things. i take the quiz in bed.

I'm coming to a definitive conclusion - there are days when I know you’re still here... lingering in the air, hanging by the door, reading a book in a corner, doing Wordle before I could; just in the other room picking something you forgot...



I can’t shake it off. It’s strange how, even after all this time, you still manage to occupy spaces you physically never occupied. I thought I could leave you behind. Thought I could pack up all the memories and lock them away in some distant corner of my mind. But it  just seeps into everything, shadows everything, until it just beggers belier that you’re still a part of me.



The smell of coffee in the morning reminds me of the mornings we spent together, your voice drifting through the air like it belonged to the silence. The kitchen towels kept as you would, the pans and cutlery too. 


The way you used to say, “We’ll figure it out,” with that smile like you had all the answers in the world still hangs like a subtitle to the silence that gets deafening otherwise. Now, I can’t stop thinking about how empty that promise feels...


You’ve become a phantom that lingers in the details of life; something I can’t touch or escape. 


And then the dreaded part of it all: I start to doubt myself. I wonder if I ever really existed to you the way you existed to me. Was I ever real to you? Or was I just a chapter in a story you already moved on from?


I used to think we were bound by something gospel that couldn’t be broken. I was so wrong and I say this, holding onto ghosts of what we were. 


There was a day, and I can still see it so clearly, when we just sat in the park, the sun hanging low in the sky, and you reached for my hand. It was such a simple thing. But in that moment, I felt like a fairytale come true.... That I’d found something that would never slip away, that nothing in this world could take from us. That small gesture became everything. And now I sit here, staring at my empty hand and that lack of warmth.


It’s the little things that get to me the most.
And every day, I’m faced with something that reminds me of you. Like the first cold breeze of autumn when we used to walk through the park, our hands buried deep in our coats, and you’d complain about the cold, but I could always tell you secretly loved it..


You’re not there to complain anymore. 


And yet you’re everywhere. In the quiet. In the chaos. In the cracks of my every day existence. You’ve become something I can't ever escape, no matter how much I try. It’s not just the memory of you. It’s the fact that every single part of my life is now colored by your absence. 


I loved you more than I ever knew how to say. I trusted you with parts of me that I couldn’t even understand. And now, all I have is a reflection of us which tells me I’ve now become a stranger to myself too...

1qcv0og,https://open.substack.com/pub/davidrmann3/p/working-doubles-in-a-restaurant?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web,Working Doubles In A Restaurant,"**Working Doubles In A Restaurant**

You arrive at 10 am. You leave at midnight. Fourteen hours on your feet. Two services. No real break between them. This is a double shift.

Most restaurant workers know the drill. The schedule posts on Wednesday. Your name appears twice on Saturday. Lunch and dinner. You do the math in your head. Sixteen hours if you count prep and breakdown. Maybe grab $400 in a single day if the tips run hot. Maybe burn out before next week if they don’t.

The restaurant industry added 150,000 jobs in 2025. Median base wages climbed to $17.11 per hour. Workers still quit at rates higher than most sectors. In June 2025, 752,000 restaurant employees walked off the job in a single month. The numbers tell one story. The floor tells another.

Doubles aren’t new. They’re survival. They’re necessity dressed up as opportunity. For the operator short on bodies, doubles keep the doors open. For the worker chasing rent money, doubles deliver cash when the bank account runs dry. For everyone else, doubles are a test of will.

This is what happens when you work sixteen hours in a restaurant. This is how you get through it. This is the difference between front of house and back of house. This is what nobody tells you until you live it.

**What A Double Shift Means**

A double shift covers two consecutive services in one day. You work lunch. You stay for dinner. The break between them lasts an hour, sometimes two, sometimes 30-minutes. You don’t leave the building. You don’t go home. You restock, you eat something standing up, you try to remember what rest feels like.

The term covers both FOH and BOH. Front of house means servers, bartenders, hosts, bussers. Anyone the guest sees. Back of house means cooks, prep cooks, dishwashers. Anyone the guest doesn’t see. The experiences differ. The exhaustion doesn’t.

Doubles happen during peak seasons, special events, understaffing. Doubles happen all the time. Restaurants operate on thin margins and thinner rosters. When someone calls out, someone else works a double. When business picks up, doubles fill the gaps. When rent comes due, people volunteer.

**FOH: The Performance**

Servers work a double by performing for fourteen hours straight. You smile at 11 am. You smile at 10 pm. The smile costs more each hour.

Your shift starts with setup. Roll silverware. Stock stations. Check your section. The lunch rush hits at noon. Tables turn fast. Orders pile up. You move. You talk. You remember who ordered what, who needs water, who asked for extra napkins. Your feet start hurting by 2 pm.

Lunch dies around 3 pm. You get maybe an hour before dinner prep. You eat something. You change socks if you brought an extra pair. You sit for ten minutes and feel your body stiffen. Standing back up takes effort.

Dinner starts at 4 pm. The energy shifts. Dinner guests linger. They order wine. They want conversation. Your face hurts from smiling, but you keep going. The tickets keep printing. The tips keep adding up. You do the math every hour. Rent is $1,400. You’re at $280. Keep moving.

The challenges stack up. You drain your social energy talking to strangers while your body screams to sit down. You maintain eye contact. You remember drink orders. You split checks. You upsell desserts when your brain wants to shut off. One server puts it plainly: the fast-paced energy matters, but the feet never stop killing you.

By 10 pm you run on fumes. Your section finally clears. You cash out. You count your tips. You walk to your car and hope you don’t fall asleep on the drive home.

**BOH: The Grind**

Cooks work a double by staying in the heat for fourteen hours. The kitchen doesn’t care about your feet, your mood, your breaking point. The tickets print. You cook them. The tickets keep printing. You keep cooking.

You arrive at 9 am for prep. Chop vegetables. Break down proteins. Prep sauces. Organize your station. Everything has a place. Everything gets checked twice. Lunch service starts at 11 am. The grill heats up. The fryer stays at 350 degrees. The air gets thick. You sweat through your first chef coat by noon.

Lunch winds down around 3 pm. You wipe down your station. You prep for dinner. You eat something if you remember. Most days you forget. You drink water from a quart container because you lose too much fluid standing over a 500-degree range.

Dinner service runs hotter and longer. More covers. More complex plates. Higher standards. The expo yells out orders. You work the line. Sauté, grill, fry, plate. Every dish goes out perfect, or it comes back. No one sees your work except the server picking it up and the guest eating it. No one thanks you until family meal tomorrow, if then.

One cook describes working from 9 am to 11 pm daily. His advice: think about a worse moment in your life. Realize this isn’t as bad. Keep cooking. The logic holds. If you survive one double, you survive the next. If the next double breaks you, you already know you’re done.

The physical toll compounds. You stand on concrete for hours. Your hands move through the same motions hundreds of times. Dice, sauté, plate, repeat. Your lower back screams by hour ten. Your wrists ache by hour twelve. You ignore it because stopping means falling behind, and falling behind means the whole line suffers.

Research shows that working twelve hours per day increases injury risk by 37%. Evening shifts see 18% more accidents than day shifts. Night shifts see 30% more. The data doesn’t lie. Long hours make you slower, clumsier, more prone to mistakes. In a kitchen, mistakes mean cuts, burns, trips, falls. You work through it anyway.

**How To Survive The Double**

**Before You Clock In**

Sleep matters more than you think. Go to bed early the night before. Your body needs every hour it gets. Skipping sleep to hang out with friends costs you the next day. The price is high.

Hydrate before you start. Drink water the night before. Drink more water in the morning. Bring a water bottle. Fill it at least three times during your shift. Dehydration kills focus. Focus keeps you moving.

Invest in shoes. Not the cheap ones. Not the ones that look good. The ones that work. Non-slip service shoes. Get insoles. If you can’t afford good shoes, bring a second pair to change into mid-shift. The difference shows up around hour eight.

Pack food. Real food. Not the fried stuff sitting under the heat lamp. Not the pasta someone burned during family meal. Bring protein. Bring vegetables. Bring something your body needs instead of something your mouth wants. Heavy food makes you sluggish. Light food keeps you upright.

Plan your stations. Know where everything lives. Know your prep list. Know your sidework. The mental game plan saves energy. Confusion drains energy. You need every bit you have.

**During Your Shift**

Don’t watch the clock. Time slows down when you count it. Stay busy. Clean when service slows. Prep when you finish a task. Movement makes hours pass. Stillness makes hours drag.

Pace yourself. A double isn’t a sprint. You can’t blow out in the first four hours and expect to finish strong. Find a rhythm. Hold it. Adjust when you need to, but stay consistent. Consistency beats intensity over sixteen hours.

Drink water constantly. Every time you pass your bottle, take a drink. Your body loses more fluid than you think. Sweat, heat, stress, all of it pulls water out. Replace it or pay later.

Eat during your break. Not a big meal. Not three slices of pizza. Something that fuels you without weighing you down. Protein and vegetables. Skip the bread and pasta. Carbs crash you two hours later. You can’t afford the crash.

Change something at the break. Different socks. Different shoes. A fresh shirt if you have one. The psychological reset matters as much as the physical one. Your brain notices the change. Your body follows.

Build camaraderie. Talk to your coworkers. Share the suffering. A little humor goes far. Some teams just complain together for five minutes. It works. Shared misery bonds people. Bonds keep you going.

Focus on small wins. Don’t think about the next eight hours. Think about the next hour. The next table. The next ticket. Break it down. Finish one thing. Start the next. Repeat until you clock out.

Stay positive. Your attitude spreads. If you drag, everyone around you drags. If you stay upbeat, the energy lifts. Choose to lift. The shift passes faster when the mood stays light.

**FOH Details**

Keep backup supplies in your locker. Deodorant. Mouthwash. Freshen up between services. Guests notice when you look tired. Looking fresh keeps tips higher.

Bank your energy for peak hours. Lunch might run light. Dinner won’t. Save your best performance for when the money shows up. Prioritize the high-dollar tables. Maximize your earning window.

Don’t skip sidework. Rolling silverware during the lull saves you stress later. Running out of setups during dinner rush kills your flow. Stay ahead of your tasks.

Reset your mindset between services. Every guest walking in for dinner doesn’t know you worked lunch. They expect fresh energy. Give it to them. Fake it if you need to. They won’t know the difference.

Communicate with the kitchen. Tell them when you’re in the weeds. Tell them when you need something fired fast. Good communication prevents disasters. Disasters tank tips.

**BOH Details**

Organize your station early. Keep it organized all day. A messy station slows you down. Slow stations back up the line. Backed up lines create chaos. Chaos creates mistakes. Mistakes create waste. Waste costs everyone.

Prep extra mise during your break. Dice more onions. Prep more proteins. Stock more containers. Dinner always runs harder than lunch. Running out mid-service destroys momentum. Momentum keeps you sane.

Change your coat if you sweat heavy. A dry coat feels better. Feeling better helps you move. Moving helps you finish.

Use proper body mechanics. Lift with your legs. Keep your back straight. Repetitive strain injuries accumulate over time. Protect yourself now or hurt yourself later.

Talk to FOH clearly. Tell them when the kitchen is slammed. Tell them when an order will take longer. Clear communication prevents confusion. Confusion creates conflict. Conflict ruins shifts.

**After You Finally Leave**

Eat real food. Your body needs nutrients. Give it protein and vegetables. Don’t just grab fast food and collapse. Fuel your recovery.

Drink more water. You lost gallons over sixteen hours. Replace them. Dehydration extends recovery time. Recovery time determines how you feel tomorrow.

Shower. Stretch. Breathe. Let your muscles relax. Let your mind slow down. Give yourself ten minutes of quiet before you crash.

Sleep. Real sleep. Seven hours minimum. Your body repairs itself during sleep. Skip sleep, and you start the next shift already damaged. Damaged workers break faster.

Don’t make big decisions. You’re exhausted. Your judgment is compromised. Wait until tomorrow. Tomorrow, you think clearly. Tonight, you’re trying to survive.

**The Culture Of Doubles**

Restaurant workers treat doubles as badges of honor. You worked a double. You survived. You earned respect. The money helps. The camaraderie helps more.

Some workers schedule doubles every week. Sunday doubles. Saturday doubles. Holiday doubles. The math works out. One double pays more than two short shifts. Tipped workers especially chase doubles. The earning potential outweighs the physical cost until it doesn’t.

Between 2020 and 2021, 52% of hospitality workers quit due to burnout. The jobs demand too much. Long shifts interfere with personal life. Irregular hours prevent work-life balance. Low wages relative to effort push people out. Health concerns keep people away. The turnover cycle feeds on itself. Short staff means more doubles. More doubles mean more burnout. More burnout means more turnover.

The workers who stay develop systems. They bring extra socks. They pack better food. They hydrate smarter. They pace themselves. They build bonds with coworkers who understand. The systems work until they don’t. Then people leave.

One server describes doubles as standard practice. She works every Sunday double. She brings water. The staff rotates bringing coffee. Some bring snacks for everyone. Everyone helps. Small acts of support make brutal days bearable.

The best operators notice. They monitor who works too many doubles. They rotate schedules. They build deeper rosters. They understand that burning out good workers costs more than hiring additional staff. The worst operators exploit. They schedule the same people for doubles weekly. They don’t care about turnover because someone always needs hours. The model works short-term. Long-term, it collapses.

**Know Your Rights**

Some states regulate shift work. California requires overtime pay after eight hours in a day. Other states have different rules. Know your local laws. Know what your employer owes you.

Doubles scheduled regularly without proper compensation or rest violate labor standards in some jurisdictions. If your employer schedules you for doubles constantly without regard for your health or legal limits, examine whether the restaurant is adequately staffed. If management relies on doubles to fill fundamental scheduling gaps, the problem is structural. The solution is hiring, not exploitation.

Workers aged 18 to 27 increasingly prioritize work-life balance over higher pay, and in recent surveys, roughly six in ten say they would accept lower wages for better balance. In restaurants, average hourly earnings have climbed from the mid-teens in 2021 to around $21 today, largely because workers left for better-paying or more sustainable jobs, forcing operators to respond. Many of those exits were driven by unsustainable conditions. Burnout. Long hours. Frequent double shifts. This has pushed the industry to slowly improve both pay and scheduling.

**The Reality**

Doubles test you. Physically, mentally, emotionally. You learn what your body tolerates. You learn what breaks you. You learn who you work well with under pressure. You learn whether this job is worth what it costs.

The money matters. Rent comes due every month. Bills stack up. A good double clears $300 to $500, depending on the restaurant. Bad doubles still pay better than sitting home. Money makes the world go round. The calculation makes sense until your body stops cooperating.

Respect matters too. Your coworkers see you grinding. They see you staying when others leave. They see you showing up ready to work both shifts without complaint. Building credibility opens doors. Better shifts. Better sections. Better opportunities.

Respect and money don’t fix exhaustion. Research on shift work is clear. Long hours disrupt sleep patterns, increase cardiovascular risk, contribute to metabolic disorders, heighten anxiety and depression. The effects accumulate. One double doesn’t break you. Ten doubles in a month start showing cracks. Twenty doubles in two months push you toward chronic fatigue. Chronic fatigue leads to injuries, mistakes, burnout.

The OSHA data is stark. Workers on extended shifts see injury rates climb 37% compared to standard shifts. Fatigue impairs judgment. Impaired judgment causes accidents. Accidents hurt people. The cost isn’t abstract. The cost is pain. The cost is real.

You survive doubles by preparing properly, pacing intelligently, recovering completely. You don’t survive doubles by ignoring limits. Limits exist for reasons. Your body tells you when enough is enough. Listen to it.

Some workers thrive on doubles. They prefer longer days and fewer shifts per week. They manage their energy well. They recover properly. They choose this structure. Choice matters.

Other workers get stuck in double shifts because management schedules them or because the money is too necessary to decline. Necessity removes choice. Removed choice creates resentment. Resentment accelerates burnout.

If you work doubles occasionally, prepare thoroughly. If you work doubles regularly, examine why. If you work doubles constantly, something is wrong. Either the restaurant is understaffed, or you need the money too badly, or you haven’t learned to say no. All three problems require solutions beyond working harder.

**Final Word**

Working a double shift in a restaurant can be fun, brutal, valuable, exciting, exhausting, interesting, profitable, educational, unsustainable. The experience teaches you endurance. It builds character. It also wrecks your body if you do it too often without proper recovery.

Prepare correctly. Pace intelligently. Recover thoroughly. Respect your limits. Support your coworkers. Know when to walk away.

The industry needs workers willing to grind. The industry also needs to stop burning through workers like disposable resources. Those two truths sit together uncomfortably. They’ll continue sitting together until operators build sustainable staffing models and workers demand better conditions.

You’ll work doubles. Most restaurant workers do. Some of those doubles will be worth it. Some won’t. Learn to tell the difference. Your health depends on it. Your career depends on it. Your life outside this industry depends on it.

Now go prep your station. Service starts soon.

This is a hectic diary transitioning between holidays to the New Year! I was feeling motivated to reflect on the last week of 2025. Enjoy!

**Section One: Assets and Debt**

Retirement Balance: $200k across Roth IRAs, 401a, 403b, 457b, and brokerage. J has a few retirement accounts from previous jobs, but nothing too significant.

Equity: \~$175k. We bought this home in 2020 for $310k with 3% down. Reappraisal in 2022 dropped the PMI and it has risen in value $130k since to around $435k. 

Savings account balance: $0 for me (just bought a car 🥲) $10k in J’s. $20k in joint.

Checking account balance: $435 for me, $4k for J. $1.7k in joint. $26k in business.

Credit card debt: Chase Sapphire Reserve current balance $3.5k, Amex Delta Skymiles Reserve current balance $1.2k (these two are mostly from the car purchase, we pay in full every month). Business Amex $15.5k (also pay in full every month).

Student loan debt: None. I have a B.S. J has a B.S. and Master’s.

Other assets: Our small plane, still insured for $125k.

**Section Two: Income**

Income Progression: Most of this is covered in my past MDs, here is a short recap and 2023+ update.

I have been working for 8 years, initially in a traditional STEM field before pivoting to an emerging technology.

2018: Started at a firm with base salary $47k + small yearly bonus and COL raises. 

2021: Job change to a firm for $72k base salary + 10% yearly bonus.

2022: Job change to my dream VP position for $100k, plus $10k teaching position. Pivot career fields to an emerging technology that affects many industries. 

2023: A 4% mid-year and 2% EOY raise brings me to base salary of $106k. Still teaching 1 semester/year for $10k. I also complete a significant professional exam and become licensed in my state. J and I start a business adjacent to their field. 

2024: A 3% mid-year raise brings me to base salary of $109k. Still teaching 1 semester/year for $10k. (I also receive Employee of the Year!). Our business gets a few more significant contracts.

2025: A 4% mid-year raise along with 1.5% bonus puts me at total compensation of about $115k (plus $10k for teaching). We sign a new customer to our business and it really takes off.

**Main Job Monthly Take Home: $3,317.76**

$803 Federal taxes, $334 State taxes, $709 Social Security and Medicare, $214 in medical/dental/vision insurance (both myself and J), $474 to my 401k (I put in 5%, work puts in additional 9% match), $1800 to my 403b (work matches with max $20), $1800 to my 457b.

**Side Gig Take Home**

I am licensed and do 1-2 real estate transactions per year for family and friends, netting $5-$10k/transaction. 

**Other Income**

J makes between $5-$15k/mo at his primary job. He averages between $100-$175k yearly salary. J and I have also steadily built a business adjacent to their industry that has grown for the past 3 years and is now profiting around $100k/year. This has been a team effort over many late nights.

**Section Three: Expenses**

Mortgage: $1,757 PTI

Retirement contribution: $625 to Roth IRA

Savings contribution: I put $300-$500 to savings -- sometimes more, sometimes less. J. will put in some based on his income that month, usually around $1,000-$3,000. We are saving for various things and keep a spreadsheet allocating the money.

Investment contribution: I am really trying to max the accounts I have access to at my job. J is self-employed and has less access to these kinds of accounts so I’ve increased my contributions over the past few years to as much as possible.

Credit cards: We put most of the expenses in this section on Chase or Amex and pay it off in full each month.

Donations: We prefer to donate our time.

Electric/Gas/Water: 2025 averages were $285/$85/$50

Wifi: $80 home fiber, $295/mo various Starlinks for business/travel

Cellphone: $276 (J dropped his second work line but one kid has a phone now, the other has a watch, and both have cell-enabled iPads, plus device protection 🤪)

Shared Subscriptions: Amazon Prime and music $25/mo, Netflix $25/mo, $5.99/mo Garmin LTE, $11.95/mo emergency satcom, $2.99/mo Google Storage, $16.80/mo GSuite, $121/mo CRM, $29.99/mo Adobe Creative Cloud, $9.99/mo ICloud, $22/mo SiriusXM, $20/mo Apple Care, $79/mo mobile data service, $63/mo Ring (home, in-laws, and business subscriptions), $7/mo Toyota, $40/mo AI, $25/mo gym, $16/mo GoodSam, YouTube Premium $13.99/mo, Shipping membership $15/mo. Random weather and outdoor apps $50/month.

Real Estate License Fees: $136/mo

Health insurance for B: $100/mo

Life insurance: $244/mo for J ($2M 30yr policy) and $98/mo for myself ($1M 30yr policy)

Car payment/insurance: No car payments! I just bought a $40k mid-size used SUV (details below). Our fleet has changed considerably in the past few years to now include 2 daily drivers, 1 RV, and multiple trailers. Insurance runs $1770/year and taxes $1400/year.

Groceries: \~$1000/mo, including alcohol. (We have 2 kids ½ of the time)

Other random household products/drugstore/kid stuff: \~$1000/mo

Eating out/Dates: \~$1000/mo (We like food and wine and honestly need the convenience. I should really hire a meal prep service).

Plane: We now budget $200/hr of flight in our plane -- which takes care of our hangar rent, fuel, insurance, taxes, and most maintenance. We save extra money for upgrades. We can fly anywhere from 2–20 hours/month. So, $400-4000/month depending on weather and travel plans. Our hangar rent is $625/mo.

J’s travel budget for work: avg $1500/mo (they travel about 5-8 days/mo). Sometimes they use the plane or RV.

Monthly House Cleaning: none (although I want this back so bad). I did get a high end Robo vacuum that we really like but oddly I have not trained it to do bathroom toilets and kitchen counters 😂)

Wholesale Grocery Club Membership: $110/yr

Kids: $3300/mo private school tuition (one kid). Long story but they needed it for serious learning issues discovered a few years back. They are in their third year at this school and are thriving. $150/mo school meal fees.

Business fixed expenses: $1500/mo (rent, utilities)

J covers most of our monthly recurring bills, their primary work expenses, and private school, while I purchase most of our groceries, household items, and any other random things we need. A lot of spending is expensed back through our business, which is lifestyle-adjacent. This has allowed me to really cut back my take home pay from my primary job and max available retirement accounts. We aren’t afraid to spend significantly more on quality items that will last a lifetime. I pay for my subscriptions, life insurance, and most travel planned with the grandparents/kids. I don’t differentiate when J pays versus myself since we treat everything as “ours.” We have J’s two kids half of the time – middle school ages.

**Section Four: Background**

See previous MDs.

**Money Diary**

**Friday**

My work is still closed for the holidays, so I leisurely shower and skincare (mostly Prequel and The Ordinary products) and pick out a comfy outfit (ON jeans, Adidas, sweater). We pick up the kids and head to see J’s family a few hours away. J and I are a bit tired and sore as we spent the previous day powering through a 1-day construction project at our business. The kids giggle it up in the backseat, high on Christmas and too much sugar. I spend the drive as a passenger princess (aka heavily car shopping) and chatting with J about our business. 

Side Note: Premise for the car shopping

My trusty 10 year old vehicle with 260k miles that was also the family hauler bit the dust earlier this summer (literally caught on fire, but that’s another story) and I’ve been getting by on a loaner from a relative (even older and more questionable reliability). My primary work has gone to 3 days in office and I’m commuting 1 hr each way, so I need something safe and comfortable. Plus the kids are getting bigger (and less messy), so we’re ready for a trim level upgrade. I have a budget of $35-$40k out the door for a midsize SUV < 5 years old and < 60k miles. Both J and I’s primary work is mostly shut down between Christmas and New Year and I know this is some of the only time I’ll have to focus on the car search with our busy lives. 

We take an exit that has Starbucks (J and I get oat milk lattes - $11.22), Wendy’s for the kids ($24.21) and a sandwich for J ($12.89) plus gas for our RV ($57.89). While I’m waiting for the understaffed Starbucks to produce my order (I tipped them extra cash  - $10), I find an ad for what might be “the one” and send it to J. It fits all my needs AND wants, plus the price was just dropped. A few books that J ordered ship from Amazon ($66.55). I order a few accessories to J’s gift to me that is coming soon ($84). We press on and arrive in time for dinner with family and spend the evening opening presents and visiting. It’s wonderful to see everyone. I play a hilarious charade-style game with the kids and cousins. 

**Saturday**

In the morning we all head over to see extended relatives’ new home on a large piece of land. The kids (and let’s be honest, adults too) play on the “ultimate grandparent gift of the year” which involves racing around in the field and exploring the property. J helps with a mechanical problem on his relative’s work vehicle while I visit with their 1yo and soak up the sunshine and warmth abnormal for this time of year and season. We say our goodbyes to this group and snag my favorite local fast food for lunch ($28.23), then transition to visit with J’s other parent. The kids open more presents at their home, then we take everyone out to eat dinner at a local pizza joint ($60.53). We get a tasty pizza combination of Italian sausage, banana peppers, and feta, plus a glass of wine for me. J and I stay up far too late with their parent rehashing some recent significant life events and catching up. I am exhausted when we finally pass out at 1am.

**Sunday**

We go with J’s parent to see a property they have inherited and figure out the next steps. It is a big endeavor that I know we will be spending quite a bit of time helping them with. Next, we all go to lunch at another relative’s home and spend some time helping with tasks around their home. Afterwards, J and I decide to gift their parent a specific item since we noticed a need, so we head out with one kid in search of it. It is a surprisingly easy item to find in this small town ($656.34 for item + moving supplies for it). We grab a few more things at the hardware store next door ($34.08). We load up and head back to the house, where we recruit some neighborhood help to get it in the door and set up. J’s parent is very appreciative. We love them so much and are happy to do what we can. We eat leftovers for dinner and hang out. 

**Monday**

This is the only day J’s work is open, so we both spend most of the day on the couch working on his job and our adjacent business while the kids go out for quality time with J’s parent. I am starting to feel quite sick - swollen throat and that funny feeling behind my eyes. I really want to just lay around. I am not motivated to do skincare beyond Cerave moisturizing cream and don’t make it out of my comfy pajamas. It’s all I can do to look at spreadsheets. It doesn't help that the weather has taken a turn to cold, rainy, and windy. J and I were going to head back today since my parent is having outpatient surgery in our home city, but I’m feeling too bad to travel and don’t want to get the patient sick. We stay in constant nervous contact with my other parent and sibling instead and console ourselves that we’ll visit them asap. 

The kids finally return from a fun day. They are super sweet and play some with their presents — we all can’t believe how big they are getting. I help the oldest with their new Nail Art pens and we take turns doing designs on each other. We eat J’s parent’s signature home-cooked meal for dinner. I message the ad for the car and start negotiating price and a time to view it. It is about 1.5 hrs from our home city and will be a few days before we can go there. A supplier charges the business for some orders ($17,866.52). My parent’s surgery was quick and successful and they are home resting. It will be a several month recovery. J and I run out to the local grocery store and I take advantage of their wine special to restock our RV ($93.12). We split a bottle and chat with J’s parent. In bed I order some Olaplex ($98.45) and try to fall asleep early.

**Tuesday** 

As soon as I wake up I can tell my body is still trying but failing to hold off illness. J says he found some items on marketplace for our business in a town nearby. We just moved the business into a new space and are in desperate need for these things (plus it’s a great price). We say goodbye to the kids, who are scheduled to stay another two days with extended family before going to their other parent’s, and head an hour up the road to evaluate J’s find. We get coffee on the way ($16.57). It turns out there are far more items available than we thought, so we rent a box truck one-way ($278.30) and spend hours loading up (just what my exhausted immune system needed, some heavy lifting…plus, I break a nail) before driving back to our home city ($1400). We get gas in both vehicles ($109.97) and I buy some straps to secure the items in the box truck ($82.11) and some lunch ($14.92). We get some drinks from the gas station ($25.63). I call my parents on the drive and rehash the surgery. I am so happy to talk to them and time passes quickly. It is dark when we arrive to our business and some friends help us unload, a process 10x faster than loading. We return the box truck and race to our favorite restaurant for a late dinner to celebrate our success ($70 + $50 cash tip, since our favorite bartender lets me call in our order near closing and has it ready at the bar so we can have a glass of wine)! I make a refundable deposit to hold the car ($1,000) until tomorrow afternoon. Another supplier charged the business card ($7,811.26). I have survived the day on adrenaline and DayQuil — J and I crash hard when we are finally home.

**Wednesday**

Ok, now I’m really sick. Full blown stuffy, sneezy, sore throat and exhausted. But I am excited because J’s Christmas present to me/us arrived early. Alas, there is no time to unbox and it’s not like I could manage using the item right now anyways, since this particular gift involves going outside and learning a new physical skill. I am extra excited that J also got one for himself, so we can do this activity together. The morning passes in a sick blur… I finally take a shower and pull on some jeans and a sweater. J drives me to go look at the car in the next major city 1.5 hrs away. We get salads on the way ($24.48) and a coffee treat ($11.07). I message the sales agent that I want the best cash price since I’m obviously serious and am coming from out of state. He knocks another $1k off. While J drives, I try to survive and move money around in anticipation. I have $23k saved up from my primary job. My parent also calls and lets me know they want to gift $6k and transferred it to my account. This was unexpected but they have always been passionate about having a safe vehicle and I am super grateful. The dealership allows up to $5k on a credit card (I’ll do that for the points, plus it also tells me what our negotiating room is). I pull the remaining $6k out of the business. We stop and get a cashiers check for the difference, since the bank will be closed after our test drive. The test drive goes perfectly — it’s everything we wanted except for one small cosmetic issue and one broken interior item. The dealership fixes the interior part while we wait and have bougie drinks from their superautomatic machine. I get them to waive the doc fees to make up for the cosmetic issue — I just don’t have it in me to negotiate further or act like I’ll walk away. The price is very fair. I pop some more DayQuil and settle in to sign all the papers. Finally it’s over at 8pm ($39,036) and we drive home! I am elated, I’ve never had anything this new, safe, or nice and I know I will keep this vehicle for years to come, until the kids are out of school. After always buying and driving sub $10k quality vehicles with 200k+ miles on them, I’m feeling super thankful for J and I’s hard work and relationship. What a way to close out the year! 

**Thursday**

I am still sick but on the mend. We spend the day working on our business, organizing the items we bought. I bring our Christmas gifts to practice with — it’s hard but I’ll get the hang of it eventually 🤣. Of course J is a natural at this activity. I order floor mats and a few other items for the car ($598), plus a pack of air tags ($69). We grab a nearby halal place for lunch ($37.40). I contemplate going on a sunset flying date around the area but it’s really windy out and I’m still on the DayQuil. I hate this time of year because opportunities to fly our plane are so limited, it’s depressing. Instead, I settle for getting my nail repaired ($30) and talk to my recovering parent some more — I’m so happy they are doing well. We go home and watch the new Knives Out movie and have air fryer snacks for dinner. J makes a payment to the business card (-$30,000).

**Friday**

Technically J and I’s primary jobs are back to work today, so we try to get caught up but it’s hard with a lot of other folks still on leave. I’m able to work on a few tasks that needed uninterrupted attention and answer pertinent emails from before the holiday. J and I spend time at lunch eating barbeque and mapping out the year and our goals ($39.89). Late afternoon we stop by the business and organize some more, plus prep a few orders. The new location is really coming together but I can tell we may outgrow it quickly (a good problem to have). Finally, we go to visit my recovering parent about an hour away, picking up dinner ($51.25) and returning something to Home Depot (-$295.60) on the way. I am so excited to not be so sick anymore and to see my parents.  We snuggle their puppy, show them the new car, and talk to them for hours. I love them so much and they are grateful to have visitors. On the way home, J and I stop by and look at another vehicle that needs to be moved to the new business location that our friend said wouldn’t start. We repair a blown fuse and it turns over right away. J triumphantly drives it to the new location while I pick up a sushi snack for us from the nearby grocery store ($24.36). We head home to snuggle on the couch and watch our favorite YouTubers.

**Totals:**

Food + Drink: $580.14

Fun / Entertainment: $150.55

Home + Health: -$185.98

Clothes + Beauty: $128.45

Transport: $40,564.27

Other: Gift ($656.34), Business (-4,322.22) 

**Reflection**

This diary really captures how full and intertwined our life feels right now. Work, family, and our business all bleed together, and money is something I think less about in isolation and more as a tool that supports all of it. We use it to create safety (RIP to my trusty vehicle), to step in when family needs help, and to buy back time and flexibility during an honestly exhausting season. Laying everything out makes it clear how intentionally we’ve structured things: J’s higher and more variable income covers most of the fixed costs, while I’ve been able to aggressively max retirement accounts and focus on long-term stability.

The car is obviously the standout expense this week, but it wasn’t an impulse decision. It was months of planning, a clear budget, and a realistic acknowledgment of where we are in life right now. The same is true for other big-ticket items—supporting family, investing in our business, and prioritizing education. None of those are cheap, but they’re non-negotiable and very aligned with our values. That said, I can also see how much convenience spending creeps in when we’re tired and stretched thin, which is something I want to be more mindful of heading into the new year.

More than anything, this diary makes me feel grateful. Grateful for a partner who genuinely treats everything as “ours,” for parents who still show up (and are able to) in meaningful ways, and for the ability to get through a hectic, illness-filled, emotionally heavy week without added financial stress. I am appreciative of both the privilege and hard work that has brought us this far. Going into the next year, my focus isn’t on squeezing every dollar harder. Instead it’s on using the stability we’ve built to protect our time, energy, and relationships, and to make this pace more sustainable while still achieving our goals.",11,1768414987.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,2,0.83,False

To clarify, he's very good at publishing them, and employs a lot of people who are also very good at doing that, but this is different to actually making them

This would explain the glacial pace of releases. Since Fallout 3, there's been like 3 games. Fallout 4, Fallout 76, and Starfield. Skyrim remasters and re-releases are as documented as they are ridiculed. Starfield was hyped as a new IP, but objectively, what's to stop a company working on 2 games at once? It's not like Capcom, Squenix, Ubisoft, CDPR, or Rockstar have ever done that. 2 games *at the same time*? What are you, mad? The only way this can be explained is because it's just one man, Todd, in a room, with a window overlooking a field and a farm. You think Microsoft money will help Todd and Zenimax? Of course not, why hire people when they cost money? Just make a damn game by yourself, it's much cheaper.

I've played like 1300 hours of FO4 and watched playthroughs of 76 and Skyrim. What are the enemies? Crabs, people, bears, bugs, and canines. Oh aye, there's that big bat as well. But where's the rodents, the fish, the birds, the megafauna? They don't exist because the Creation Engine doesn't handle aerial or subnautical combat well, and Todd can't figure out how to make it do that. Vertibirds are reskinned dragons, CEs aerial movement is ""walking, but the legs are invisible"", and their attacks are entirely projectile-based. You'd think that an airborne or subnautical enemy might want to physically attack you - nope, gotta get my (invisible) feet on the ground first.

TES VI was announced in 2018 but what was that announcement, really? Cloudy mountains and a title. That’s not a studio pipeline, that’s one guy saying “I’ll get to it after lunch” for eight years. There's been literally zero news since then, no gameplay, no story, no VAs, nothing. It's because Todd wanted to say ""yes, the next one is coming, promise"" but wanted to make Starfield first. He did but couldn't, or forgot how to, make a game beyond loading screen, walk 20m, shoot a dude, collect a thing, loading screen.

It also explains Bethesda bugs. Not “haha quirky studio culture” bugs, but actual bugs. Physics objects launching into the stratosphere. NPCs choosing to live inside walls. Quest markers pointing to a location that exists only conceptually. The PC walking into a car and dying. These aren’t QA oversights, these are the kind of mistakes you make when you’re tired, under-caffeinated, and forgot what you were fixing 14 hours ago.

People say “but Bethesda has hundreds of employees”. Have you seen them? No, we’ve seen Todd. Repeatedly. Who else works at BGS? Me? Nope. You? Probably not.

My theory is that everyone else left years ago and Todd simply didn’t update the website. The games still ship because Todd is adequately talented, but also deeply overworked, which is why every release feels like a miracle held together with duct tape and vibes.

I'm a 19-year-old girl and a complete introvert. Large groups and noisy places wear me out very quickly, small talk feels awkward and tiring, and I feel most at peace and recharged when I have time alone or with just one person I can be completely relaxed around. I've grown to really value this part of who I am, but lately I've been hoping to meet someone who lives in the same quiet rhythm. Someone I can get to know slowly and naturally, without any pressure to be constantly outgoing, active, or filling every moment with conversation or plans.

I'm currently in my first year of college, keeping my days fairly simple and low-key outside of classes. In my free time I enjoy reading fantasy novels that let me escape into detailed worlds and stories, watching thoughtful movies or series that take their time to develop characters and atmosphere, listening to gentle music like lo-fi, ambient, or soft indie while I journal random thoughts, doodle absentmindedly, or just sit quietly with a cup of tea. I like brewing coffee or tea exactly how I prefer it, taking long walks when the streets are peaceful and uncrowded, collecting quotes or passages that feel meaningful, and simply letting hours pass while my mind wanders freely. Crowded events, loud environments, and packed social schedules make me feel overwhelmed fast. I thrive best in calm, slow, and unhurried moments.

I'm not looking for someone who wants to change that about me or push me into a more extroverted way of living. What I'm hoping to find is another introvert who understands without needing much explanation. Someone comfortable with silences that don't feel empty, who prefers one deep conversation over many light ones, who would enjoy simple shared activities like reading quietly in the same space, exchanging book or music recommendations, watching something atmospheric together, or talking about life, feelings, dreams, or random ideas when the moment feels right. I believe two introverts can build something really gentle, respectful, and meaningful because we both honor personal space and choose closeness carefully.

I'd like to hear from guys around 18 to 23 who also identify as introverted. You don't have to be extremely shy or have trouble talking, just someone who naturally recharges in solitude, thinks deeply, and prefers thoughtful, low-energy connection over constant stimulation or frequent plans. Distance is fine if the conversation feels genuine and worth keeping up.

If this sounds like it could resonate with you, please feel free to message me whenever you're ready. Maybe share a little about yourself, like what you enjoy doing when you're alone, a book or song that's been on your mind lately, or what your idea of a perfect calm evening would be. There's no need to reply quickly or be very talkative at first. We can start small, move at whatever pace feels comfortable for both of us, and see if it grows naturally. I'm just hoping to find one person who makes the quiet feel a little less lonely and a little more shared. Thank you for reading this.",0,1768414812.0,IntrovertDating,3,0.44,False

Like I can troubleshoot production issues fine, that's not the problem, it's more about maintaining any sort of mental sharpness for 12+ hours straight while also not completely destroying my sleep schedule for the next week afterwards.

By hour 8 or 9 my brain just starts turning to mush, especially on those shifts where nothing's really breaking and I'm just sitting there monitoring dashboards waiting for alerts. Coffee stops helping around midday and just makes me feel jittery and kind of anxious which is obviously not ideal when you might need to make quick calls about prod systems. Energy drinks made me feel worse after the rush dropped.

The sleep thing is probably the bigger issue though? Because even if I time my caffeine right I still end up lying in bed at 2am completely wired even though I'm exhausted, then the next day I'm useless. Can't really nap during quiet periods either because my brain won't let me disconnect knowing I could get paged any second.

Just curious what other people do for these situations because my current approach of drinking more coffee and hoping for the best is clearly not working lol.

1qcuvot,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1qcuvot/a1c_of_51_three_months_after_diagnosis/,A1C of 5.1 three months after diagnosis,"I got my labs done this week after being diagnosed in early October 2025. Not only did my A1C go from 6.7 to 5.1 since Oct. but my ALT liver enzymes went from 53 to 18 and my cholesterol went from 285 to 151. I also lost 16 pounds. I worked so hard to get here and am elated.

I know I am still a diabetic (I always will be!) and plan on continuing to lose weight and eat right to get healthier each and every day. What’s crazy to me is I was able to make these improvements despite never stepping into a gym this entire time, never counting calories and I have still on occasion enjoyed pasta, bread, rice, real dessert on birthdays and Christmas, etc. 

Some background info for anyone who is curious. I’m a 28F and am five feet tall. I weighed 150 at diagnosis. I do have a significant family history of T2d (my dad and two grandparents) but was very surprised when I got the diagnosis. I felt a lot of shame and was super scared and hopeless. Doctor prescribed me 10mg. statin and 500 mg. Metformin (half a pill at lunch and half at dinner) which I tolerated well. Surprisingly he actually told me when I was prescribed a glucometer to avoid checking even daily — only check when you don’t feel well. I think he was just trying not to overwhelm me or make me numbers obsessed. 

Well I’m a numbers person so I didn’t think that would work for me. I was very depressed and ate almost nothing for a few days but then I decided I was going to learn what foods were right for me by slowly trying different meals, seeing how they affected my numbers before eating, one hour after eating and two hours after eating. Over many weeks I introduced different meals into my diet this way and found tons of delicious things that treated my numbers well and learned what spiked me more.

I did a lot of research on what ways of eating might work for me. I determined that I did not want to go full keto but my nutritionist recommended no more than 45 g. Of carbs per meal so I stuck to that. I also made sure nearly everything I consumed had at least 1 g. Of fiber for every 5 g. Carbohydrates. I prioritized protein and almost always ate fiber first, protein second and carbs last. I also went for a long walk after every lunch and dinner. 

I tested a lot at first but as I began to know my body and the numbers became more predictable I only tested every other day or so, or when trying a new food. 

I’d love to make a second post on some of the meals I’ve been hyper fixating on since diagnosis. Dave’s killer thin sliced bread in particular has been an absolute game changer and I’ve been making the most delicious ice coffees of my life every morning using Starbucks zero caramel macchiato creamer, premiere protein, iced coffee  mix and sugar free caramel syrup. I’ve also been loving Wilde protein chips, carb balance tortillas, and beans!!! I eat tons of greens, beans, eggs, cheese, salmon, avocado, chicken, nuts, seeds, etc. 

My biggest contributors to getting my numbers down in my opinion were the 1 to 5 fiber vs. carbohydrate rule, eating fiber first and carbs last, walking after meals, reducing stress with therapy and adjusting my sleep schedule. I also allowed myself occasional treats like on Thanksgiving or Christmas I ate what I wanted but just didn’t eat until I could explode. I enjoyed croissants, potatoes, cheesecake, ramen, etc, but 95% of the time I ate lower carb and high fiber/protein. I also consulted this subreddit a lot. 

I feel so good after losing 16 pounds and just got a gym membership so I can take my fitness goals to the next level. I will probably have to start counting calories soon to continue the weight loss because as I get smaller I know my calories needed will slowly decrease. 

I know that this is just the beginning of what I hope is a long life and going back to old habits will make those numbers shoot up quickly. I was also blessed to catch this early on and I know that the preservation of a lot of pancreatic function was a big influence on my ability to reduce these numbers. It’s a marathon and not a sprint, but for now I am thankful to all the advice I found and am happy I am taking a step in the right direction. I worked really hard through a lot of trial and error and BIG emotions. But I am actually super satisfied with my quality of life right now, especially that I’ve still been enjoying delicious food and feeling satisfied. My relationship with food has really gotten better.

There this girl I like in my college whom I like.
Ek din hum log randomly mile during submission aur humari baatein chalu ho gayi. Few days later, hum log wapas milte hai aur waha uske friends bhi the.
Un logo se milne ke baat, uska mujhe message aata hai ki ""you are good looking and teri dressing sense bhi acchi hai, aise mere dost bol rahe hai"". Next day usne mujhe coffee ke liye pucha (not as a date), aur fir hum log Gaye coffee pine, waha hum log 1-2 hrs baatein ki.
Then she said ""mere ek friend ko tu pasand aaya hai, she wants to date you."". I said ""Ek baar milla de mujhe usse, fir dekha jayega"". Fir, next week usne mujhe 2-3 coffee ke liye pucha and hum log bohot time spend karne lag gaye saath me, literally couples ki tarah ghumne lage hum log aur uske friend ka topic kabhi aaya hi nhi wapas.
Eventually 2 week continue ye chala aur mujhe usse attachment hogyi.
Usne mujhe bohot baar pucha hai ki ""Do you like someone?"" aur mai ye topic avoid karta tha because I was unsure at that time. But uske 5-6 baar puchne ke baad maine usse apni sab feeling batta di.
Usne fir bola 
""Tujhe attachment hua hoga, humne to jyada time spend hi nhi kiya.
Don't think of me in that way.
We will stay good friends.
I don't want you to get hurt because of me, I am not good.""

Ye sunn ke mera dil tut gya💔.

Iske aage bohot bekar chizze honi lagi,
Ispe response kaisa aata hai vo dekh ke aage ka kissa btata hu, help chahiye mujhe zara
