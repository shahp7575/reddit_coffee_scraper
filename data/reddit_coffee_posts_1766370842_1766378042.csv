After hacking away at antigravity's ui, I finally managed to solve a big problem with multi-agent setups. 

You know how sometimes the agent doesn't automatically execute the commands even though you gave it permission? That ramps up quickly if say you have 3 agents running at the same time.

Previously the extension only handled the current focused tab.

Now with this background mode I can just go grab a coffee and not worry about having to click endlessly.

In fact I used this exact extension in the development of this extension!

For anyone curious, how it works essentially is that it cycles through the top 3 conversations and checks for file edits and terminal commands.

1psqfir,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1psqfir/for_future_me_6_months_from_now_why_i_quit/,For future me (6 months from now) – why I quit caffeine,"I’m writing this now feeling the way I do, lethargic, a bit lost and I want to remember it clearly.

I’m having 2-3 shots of coffee a day which may not seem like much but it affects me quite a bit and right now I’m feeling  unhappy, I feel unmotivated and stuck.

Days blur together and I don’t feel in control of myself or my life.

Every morning starts with caffeine. It gives me a brief high, confidence, energy, the feeling that I can do anything. For a short window, I feel capable and hopeful.

Then the crash comes.

As the day goes on, I fall into a slump. My mood drops. My energy drops. I feel anxious in a way I never really used to. I say things without thinking sometimes. I second-guess my decisions. I don’t always share my true thoughts or opinions, and when I do speak, it doesn’t always feel aligned with who I really am.

That’s new for me. I’m 36, and coffee doesn’t feel like used to in my 20s. I don’t bounce back the same way. It’s making me lazy, unproductive, anxiety can feels heavier.

Here’s the part I don’t want to forget -

When I don’t have caffeine, I feel better.

I’m clearer, more present., my conversations are better, my relationships feel more genuine., I sleep better, I feel calm instead of rushed.

Caffeine gives me artificial confidence and momentum, but it takes something important in return consistency, clarity, and control. It narrows the gap between thought and action, and not in a good way. I react more than I choose.

I don’t feel like myself right now, and I want myself back.

This is you choosing clarity over comfort.

Consistency over quick fixes.

Yourself over stimulation.

1psqeom,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1psqeom,I'm tired and it's late again Polish part 2,"I ate Meal B from the Polish big boy for dinner. It calls for everything except the chocolate fruit bar and the cherry fruit bar. I added those for some extra calories. The meal consisted of pork in horseradish sauce, the rusks, freeze dried fruit and the lemon isotonic drink. 

The isotonic drink is a lemon flavor and it comes with 2 packets. Each one calls for 250mL of high quality H2O so I made both over a bit of ice. You could go to 300mL a pack and be fine. It was on the sweet side but pack a robust lemon flavor. I highly recommend this isotonic drink. It's a 10/10 for me. 

The freeze dried fruit is just that. One of the things I enjoy with it is the slight acid punch from the fruit and the creaminess of the banana. I'm not the biggest fan of banana but freeze dried makes it wonderful. I ended up dipping the chocolate bar into the last bits so I wouldn't leave any. Also freeze dried cherries are amazing and there were several in it. 10/10 here too. Raspberries would've been awesome in it too. 

Next is the cherry cereal bar. Every Polish ration I've had has these in them in a couple of different flavors. They're thin and have rice paper on the outside to keep your fingers from getting sticky. It's an intensely flavored granola bar. It has that granola chew to it and the cherry was deep, dark and decadent. The only thing that could've made it better was a bit of dark chocolate. 🤯🤯🤯 Another 10/10 for me. This ration also contains a jam filled chocolate bar which was raspberry. It's a darker chocolate and not overly sweet with the raspberry jam and a thin layer of crunchy something or other. These are excellent too. I feel like if we have a similar product in the US it would be overly sweet and not good. Both of these bars would've been perfect with coffee. If only I ate it for lunch instead of dinner. 10/10 again. The hits keep on coming.

Finally on to the main attraction...pork in horseradish sauce. Again the can was a bit beat up, not as bad as the other one, and had a bouncy top. I couldn't find anywhere it was compromised and it smelled fine after I opened it. I heated to boiling in a skillet for about 20 minutes or so. It has extra liquid from rinsing out the leftovers in the can and it's not to let it reduce a good bit so it was more sauce like. It had a few hearty slices of sliced pork in a lighter brown gravy. The pork itself was on the dry side. This is something I find to be the case with most canned meat. The canning process is probably too high heat for the proteins and they tighten too much. The sauce was well seasoned with a lovely horseradish undertone. It required no extra salt from me and honestly maybe just a bit of fresh cracked black pepper. You get two packs of the SU-1 rusks in this ration and now is the time to use them. They soften just a bit in the gravy and offer a pleasant rye flavor and crunchy texture. This main obviously needed rice or potatoes with it. I'd give the main an 8.5/10 mainly because the meat was dry. The chicken main is the same way except it has dark meat in it that stays succulent. The rusks are nothing really special. I enjoy them but you really need a main that has ample sauce so you can throw them in with it. They're practically teeth breaking otherwise. 7/10 for the rusks. 

So far this is still an excellent ration. I still have a couple of items left to eat and a few drinks left to imbide. ",1,1766377665.0,MRE,4,1.0,False

There are days I can't stop thinking about us. About how things would be if we had a chance to take those next steps. 

You really did abandon it all didn't you. Thank you for everything. I'll never forget how you changed my life.

I never realized how hard the distance was on you. How much pain was behind that goodbye for us. I know it was better for the both of us, for our partners, our family, our future in the end of it all as we both were falling deeply to the point where a touch could cause an explosion. It was a unavoidable ending we both needed to choose.

I know. I may have been playful when you said I was Dangerous. But I know what you actually meant. I know. I know why you couldn't get that coffee, why you couldn't let the chance of actually meeting me further hurt you knowing how it could change us. 

I wanted to be strong for both of us and even with permission, yes I knew. We couldn't meet, even if our hearts ached just for the breath of.... ""Hi""

It was getting too real, to close to never returning to that feeling of familiarity with our past lives. 

I know. 

But I can't deny how much I miss you. How much my body wakes up craving your presence. The distance didn't stop the connection we had. It was so strong we didn't make sense half the time playing with words and reminiscing our younger years somehow still feeling like teenagers ourselves. 

How you'd share your day with me and show me what new recipes you were trying from Tiktok. Heeheeehee 

Your sugar cookies of love. Heeheeehee 

Miss you Chulo. 

Wherever you are, I hope it's with those you love dearly and you hug and hold and kiss them all tightly and sweetly. Above it all, I hope you are being spoiled with love and happiness, and when you look up at the stars and a memory slips back in, I hope you smile remembering. Always. :))))

Merry Christmas Chulo, for you and your familia.

To a Happier New Years. 🥂 Wherever you are.

1psq8eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1psq8eq/does_coffee_shop_guy_like_me_or_noooo/,Does coffee shop guy like me or noooo???!!!,"There’s this coffee shop I always go to when I’m in school, it’s by my university. I left for a while because I took my classes online and traveled for a while.

I came back because I’m taking my upper division classes on campus and I started going to this coffee shop again and there was this guy. For a while I assume he flirts with everyone. I’m also a really really shy person but it comes off as bitchy because my body language is of someone who’s confident. I don’t fear eye contact.

Interaction 1: I walked in, I had just gotten over a rough break up, I looked a mess, did not care about meeting anyone.  His coworker noticed my name and acknowledge we were of the same culture, my order is ready, handsome guy brings it over and sparks a conversation based on the one with his coworker, we exchange where we’re from, asks me if I speak the same language and I say yes and we greet each other and the I leave. I was still really shy and the music was super loud.

I go back a couple times for my usual, he’s there but we pay no mind to one another bc he’s busy and I’m rushing to get to class, I just needed caffeine, but I notice he DOES STARE.

Interaction 2: I felt like a huuuge bitch for not asking anything about him, I just finished my tutoring shift, I walk over to the cafe and order my matcha before I get picked up, I order something and we don’t say anything. My brother comes to get me, I order something for him and when his order is ready I work up the courage to ask handsome guy his name. He brightens up and tells me his name, I greet him in our native language, he greets me back with the long version, I walk away.

Interaction 3: I’m there with my mom because I wanted to show her the campus and show her my favorite coffee spot. It’s busy because it’s right after graduation but he notices, stops, sees me and greets me, asks how I am. He wasn’t even my cashier. 
(I also notice right before my order is ready, he whispers something in his bosses ear while looking at me, has a cigarette and espresso in his hand, his boss pats him on the back, also making eye contact with me. He walks to the parking lot for a break. I go to the patio and look for my mom. I don’t realize until the next day that I could’ve met him in the parking lot, I genuinely don’t know what to make of the situation)


I’m really confused. I like him but I don’t want to look like a creep. This is also my absolute favorite coffee place. I feel like we keep missing each other or one of us gets shy. I go once or twice a week, now I feel like it’s weird whenever I go. I don’t wanna creep him out, I really really do like him. 

I also don’t want to get my hopes up, he is really charming and I think he’s admired by many people. I don’t want to look desperate but I also really love this coffee place, it’s perfect, it reminds me of my home country.

The sun was just about to rise, reflected by the blood-orange sky above her. She did not feel it necessary to tell them where she was going. They didn’t deserve it.

“Goodbye forever,” she said as she turned the keys in the ignition and the car’s engine began to rumble. The rumble was just enough noise to alert her parents of the escape attempt, but it was too late; by the time the front door was open, Mattie’s car was already in the street, and her dad saw nothing but the taillights before they rounded the corner, out of sight.

The sky suddenly turned its shade to blue as the yellow sun appeared to Mattie’s left. She smiled and rolled the window down to let the cool summer air in. She turned on some music. Don’t Fear the Reaper echoed through the neighborhood as if to announce Mattie’s departure and lack of regret. She did not travel far before stopping at a diner to get breakfast. 

“What can I get you to drink?” The waiter smiled earnestly and set a menu on the table.

“Uhh, I’ll just start with water, I think.”

“Okay, I’ll be right back with that.” She looked between each of the patrons as she waited. An old man sitting by himself, staring at his coffee; an old woman picking at her pancakes without eating them.

“I wonder if they know each other,” Mattie said to herself. Then her eyes went to a middle-aged man sitting near the door. She didn’t notice him when she came in. He sat staring straight ahead at the seat across from him in his booth. He was wearing a shabby suit and tie along with a fedora. Upon focusing on his face for a moment, she realized that she knew him.

“Here’s your water,” the waiter returned.

“Thank you.”

“Are you ready to order?”

“Yes, can I have eggs and pancakes?”

“How do you like your eggs?”

“Scrambled.”

“You got it.” Mattie immediately looked for the man again, but he was no longer in the booth near the door.

“Mattie?” She suddenly became aware that he was standing right next to her.

“Hi! Mr. Oliver!”

“May I sit with you for a bit?” He gave a smile that seemed genuine for a moment, but disappeared from the eyes long before it left his mouth.

“For sure.” He sat across from her. “How’s little Toby doing? Would he be ten now?”

“He’s eight and he’s doing great. Good grades in school. He’s got his mom’s brain thank god.” She looked at the bags under his eyes and in doing so noticed the redness that inhabited most of the white surrounding his pupil. 

“How are you?” She asked. He immediately became self-conscious about his appearance.

“Uhh, well. I’ve been pretty busy. It’s been hard.” Mattie felt sorry for him, but she had a feeling she knew where this was going, and she also knew she had to take full advantage. But, before that.

“Here’s your pancakes, ma'am.” They looked delicious.

“Thank you.”

“Do you need anything else?”

“No, I’m good, thank you.”

“Enjoy.” Mattie poured syrup onto her pancakes as Oliver clearly wanted to ask a question.

“Why did you come over?” Mattie asked.

“I uh. I wanted to ask you if you would be willing to watch Toby for a couple of days. I have a new product to sell.”

“What is it?”

“It’s just some useless crap, but it has a certain visual appeal.”

“Well, don’t try and sell them to me then.”

“I wouldn’t have to.” She didn’t quite understand what he meant by that. “Anyway, would you be willing to do that? I will pay you.”

“How much?”

“A thousand.” Mattie almost choked on her pancakes.

“For babysitting?”

“Once I return from this trip, I won’t have any money worries; you’ve helped us out a lot with Toby before, so I want to be generous.”

“Well, in that case. Can you pay for my pancakes as well?” 

Oliver laughed. “Yes, I can.”

“And the tip?”

“Yes.” 

“Well, in that case. You got a deal.”

“I leave today.”

“That works for me.”

Mr. Oliver lived in a different house than Mattie remembered. He replaced his homey ranch-style on the other side of town with the stone visage of this much bigger house. As opposed to radiating warmth from the mustard yellow paint and the bright-looking windows, this house exuded coldness with its grey stone and windows that spied. The grounds around the house were not well kept, as the hedge that seemed to be meant as a privacy wall was overgrown, and the stone walkways around the gardens were inhabited by green invaders unchecked by a groundskeeper. The house reminded Mattie of a gothic mansion, but it was not nearly big enough, and the large garden out front seemed incredibly out of place as all of the neighboring houses featured plain grass yards with small garden patches near their front doors. 

“When did you move here?”

“Almost a year ago now. After Eleanor, umm.” As he approached the door, his hand began to shake.

“It’s okay, you don’t have to explain anymore.” Mattie’s eyes couldn’t look straight at him as a more fulfilled picture of Mr. Oliver’s present state of living invaded her mind. She pretended to take an interest in the design of the door, which reminded her of something she couldn’t quite place.

“Thank you.” He opened the door, revealing the home’s interior. The first thing that surprised Mattie was the modern look of everything. Whether it was through refurbishment or the house being built more recently than she had initially thought, the interior was very modern compared to the exterior. She expected it to be filled to the brim with old paintings and photos of long-dead former inhabitants, along with a pervasive draught, but none of those things were present. Instead, the walls appeared painted recently with a theme of gold-yellow running through the place.   

“Toby!” Oliver yelled. “Mattie is here!” Toby walked down the stairs slowly. He yawned. “Were you sleeping?”

“Yeah. Hi Mattie!” He got a small burst of energy as he looked at Mattie and recognized her.

“Hi, Toby! How are you?” She knelt down to his level as he approached.

“I’m okay.” The lack of energy was surprising. Mattie remembered this kid as a bullet that she usually had to pin down.

“You tired?”

“Yeah…”

“I have to leave.” Oliver interrupted as he checked his watch. “Fridge is fully stocked, and the bus will pick him up tomorrow around seven-fifteen, although it’s sometimes early, so have him at the stop close to seven. Other than that, just make sure he’s in bed before I’d say eleven.” 

“That late?” 

“The day after tomorrow is Saturday, so I’m not too worried about it,” Oliver spoke defensively.

“Okay, we can watch some spooky movies. How does that sound?” Toby’s eyes lit up a little.

“Yes, please, and popcorn.”

“Of course.”

“Okay, I’m gonna leave now. You two have fun. I should be back Saturday night.’

“Good luck, Mr. Oliver.”

“Bye, Dad!” They were left to themselves. 

That night, Mattie and Toby sat on the couch with a large bowl of freshly popped popcorn.

“Your dad doesn’t still have the Shudder subscription, does he?” She asked. Toby shrugged his shoulders.

“Okay, we’ll just try it.” She put in the login and password that she remembered. She smiled as the Shudder homepage came up. “Yes! Now we're in business.” They picked a movie about a haunted house on a hill with an unsuspecting visitor. She was a little more exhausted than she anticipated so she ended up falling asleep. When she woke up, it was twelve-thirty.

“Shit.” She looked at Toby. He was sound asleep on the other side of the couch. She relaxed. “Well, at least he’s asleep.” Whatever movie was playing when she woke back up was currently in a very dimly lit scene, but as she looked at Toby, a character in the movie turned a light on. At that moment, she saw it. Standing behind the couch over Toby. It gave the impression of a man, but she couldn’t see any identifying features. He appeared as an entirely black figure wearing a trilby hat and a trench coat. 

Mattie was frozen, staring at the thing with no face. 

“I hope he comes back.” He spoke quietly in a voice that Mattie immediately afterward could not recall the sound of. He turned to look at her, revealing two tiny white lights where his eyes should’ve been and the vague outline of a face that wasn’t human.

“Wh-who would that be?” The figure stood inhumanly still, then the light from the TV darkened, blanketing him in shadow again. She searched the house with a flashlight but couldn’t find anything. 

The next day, Mattie made sure Toby got to school and spent the whole day searching through the house again. Eventually, she thoroughly searched everything except Mr. Oliver’s room. It was locked, but fortunately, Mattie had found herself needing a door to not be locked before. She retrieved a bobby pin and made short work of it. Still, little of note was found until she came across a loose floorboard. Using a kitchen knife, she pried it open and found a leather case. It was about the size of a large textbook and had a very old golden buckle that sealed it shut. Despite the case looking important, it did not have any locking mechanism or some such other thing to prevent unwanted eyes from seeing the contents of the case. So, naturally, she opened it. 

Toby came home after school, and Mattie made dinner for both of them. The two of them were silent while eating. It became clear to Mattie that Toby must know something about what she saw the night before. So, she decided to try and get him to talk.

“You didn’t seem very scared by that movie last night.” 

“I’ve seen scarier.” Toby shrugged.

Mattie chuckled. “Oh yeah, where?” 

“Have you seen him yet?” Despite this being exactly where she wanted the conversation to go, she was surprised by how quickly he brought it up. 

“The man in the hat?”

“Yes.”

“Who is he?”

“He says the case is his.”

“Oh, is it now?”

“Yeah, and he said if dad doesn’t give it back, he’s going to take me.”

“What do you mean, take you?” Toby shrugged. 

“So, what is your dad doing with the case?” 

“He wants to sell it.” 

“Is that where he went?”

“I think so. He’s tried a couple of times.” Mattie rested her head on her arms and looked at the table for a moment. She looked at the kitchen knives.

“I won’t let him take you, okay?”

“Okay.” 

He appeared again that night along with a thunderstorm. He followed Mattie around the house for hours, though she was only able to catch glimpses of him in the corner of her eye or in the corner of a room. She wondered why he was watching her now and not Toby. Eventually, they were both on the couch watching another movie. Mattie hid one of the kitchen knives between the couch cushions just in case.

“You can sleep, Toby. I’ll keep an eye out for him.”  
“Okay, thank you, Mattie.” She wouldn’t have been able to sleep if she tried, which helped her with her watch. But she caught what she didn’t expect. A key jingled and scratched against the front door. She quickly grabbed the knife and stood between Toby and the source of the noise. Mr. Oliver stepped through the door.

As he did so, she remembered what the door reminded her of. It was made of the same dark, polished wood that the door to her dad’s childhood home was. It rushed back memories of her father.

“Mattie?” He looked surprised by the sight that greeted him, but he quickly understood. “Now, wait a minute, Mattie. Think about this.” She didn’t think about it. She lunged forward with the knife and securely lodged it in his throat. He dropped to his knees, gurgling and unable to scream. Toby was still sleeping.

“You’ll have to bury him.” The figure appeared before her with glowing eyes. He began chuckling. “If you can find a spot!” He was laughing from his stomach now. Although the laugh was so inhuman, she wasn’t sure if he even had a stomach; she also wasn’t sure what he meant by his words, but when she took a shovel and picked a spot in one of the flower beds, she found out.

She dug in the storm for what at that point had been a couple of hours. She dug until she hit something, and upon clearing more of the dirt, she discovered a human skull.

“What the fuck?” She dug in another spot and found more bones. And another, and another.

“What the fuck!?” She screamed into the night. Everywhere she dug, there was already a body or the remnants of one. She dug until she found one that wasn’t bone yet. The features were still recognizable, so she was able to pick out that it was Eleanor. Mattie began crying, although if anyone was to see her, it would be impossible to distinguish the tears from the rain.

“Why did he come home early? If I had time to think, I wouldn’t have done that.”

“That’s not true.” The figure stood on one of the stone walkways in the garden. A dark silhouette with two points like stars under his hat. “You need to have the case. And for as long as you have it, I will take everything from you. Although, since you killed Mr. Oliver over there, I think I already have.”

“I think you’re right.” 

“What about him?” The figure turned his head toward the house.

“Do you still want him?”

“He’s Oliver’s. And Oliver doesn’t have the case anymore. You do.”

“Then the least I can do is take it as far away from him as possible.” 

He laughed. “I stand corrected. There is still a little something there for me to take after all.” The lightning struck, and in the small moment of light, the figure’s face revealed taut skin and teeth with no lips shaped into the permanent impression of a smile devoid of happiness and eyes from which light was bled but no light was beheld. Then came the thunder. ",1,1766376486.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Using a burner account for anonymity. Now before I start let me mention, I don't believe in slut shaming so don’t drag me and I only used the word easy to paint a picture to describe her demeanor towards men, not to diminish her as a person. The word “convenient”, fits better. I thought this would Be a good place to ask for advice on how, or if to handle this.

I'm early 30’s and in a group of friends, we've all been friends all our lives. We now we all live in different states but we still see each other often, couple times a year. We are all very decorated women, formally educated and doing well in life. All of us are now married after years of dating wonderful men (hit the jackpot, sincerely), all

Of us…except Fran.

Now let's talk about Fran. Fran lives in the DMV, great job, well educated, and she always tells us about these men who enter her life. It always starts out promising, but then shortly after they end up ghosting, leaving or just doesn't work out. Then when we ask what happened, it's always some vague form of ""men are trash"". Which, they are, I know lol but I started to realize there was a pattern. I haven't always had the best track record with men either, l myself tended to make things easy for men because it frustrated me that I couldn't just get to the point and be myself, but I had to learn over time that dating is very much a courting process.

Unfortunately, some behaviors IN MY EXPERIENCE really just make it so that men just won't take you seriously. For example, Being too open too quickly, being too sexual too soon, talking conspiracies or politics too soon (think reptilians living on mars type of conspiracies on the first date, not 9/11 lol). I had to learn this the hard way, but as soon as I started setting boundaries, raising my standards, waiting for physical intimacy to make sure we are aligned, even a kiss, saving my deeper feelings to share with my girls, not men I'm dating until I know I can trust them; my prospects started getting much better. Also, I'm not saying this is how it SHOULD be, I'm just saying how it is. All of the things I started implementing, are things I learned from older women in my life with successful marriages and partnerships.

I've shared some advice with her (when asked of course). I also had a chance to see her actual conversations with men and it's pretty....telling. She's makes herself overly available, she’s way too sexual too quickly, men will neglect her socially and she will be overly responding or understanding. Men will disappear on her all day and then give her some bullshit response and her answer will be ""oh I understand!"", stuff like that. She is always receptive to the advice but then doesn't really practice it. It has also dawned on me this is generational with her. We are all from the same culture, and it's very male centered.

So let's talk about the party. Not too long ago, we had an end of season party. I invited her and all of our friends, also we invited some eligible bachelors for her. Long story short, all of the guys were interested in her, drinks were flowing and they were all throwing themselves at her. Some dirty dancing ensues and it all snowballed from there. She really liked one of the guys and really hit it off but uh, then They basically had dry sex and got finger blasted on the living room couch in front of everyyyyone. For hours, and hours and hours. You could literally see the faces of All the guys that were interested in her then turn sour. And then, the guy she basically had sex with with clothes on at the party? Ghosted. It was hard to watch. I am Not shaming her at all, it just hurts to see a little because she has TOLD me she wants a husband, she wants kids, the white picket fence but she's not moving that way and time is ticking. Something is not aligning here with her actions and what she says she wants.

I talked to our other friends about it and we are thinking of having a tea or make a coffee session where we talk to her about it, but we aren't sure what to say or how to make it come from a place of care. It sucks because she's so wonderful and we just wanna see her happy and her the respect she deserves. We don't want her to feel judged, so I'm wondering if it's even a good idea at all. Idk, it feels like to not say something would be to be a bad friend. This is not a sex issue, but is a problem that hyper sexuality is how she is expressing deeper trauma…Now that we have seen it up close, we think we should say something.

1pspze9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1pspze9/the_living_house_part_5/,The Living House (Part 5),"Ethan stepped out of the house and pulled the back door gently shut behind him. The warped wood settled into the frame with a soft, reluctant click, as if the house itself were exhaling. Night air hit his face. The cloying sweetness vanished the instant he crossed the threshold.

He paused on the sagging porch anyway, half-expecting movement. A ripple in the wood. A faint red glow behind the boarded windows, anything to prove he hadn’t imagined it all. But the house looked ordinary again: just a rotting husk sinking into the clearing, silent and indifferent under the thin moonlight.

He felt strangely calm. The terror that had knotted his stomach on the walk in had loosened somewhere along the way, replaced by a heavy, drifting exhaustion and a mind crowded with questions he couldn’t yet shape.

Ethan turned and walked across the yard. His boots sank into the soft grass, solid and real. No tendrils reached up. No notes fluttered down. Just the quiet crunch of his own steps and the low rustle of leaves overhead.

At the tree line the others were waiting exactly where he’d left them, half-lit by phone screens and the faint glow of Edward’s dying cigarette. They straightened when they saw him, postures shifting from bored vigilance to sudden interest.

“Jesus, man,” Riley said first, lowering his phone. “You went dark for like forty minutes straight. We were starting to think you got eaten by rats or some shit.”

“Dead zone,” Ethan answered automatically. His voice sounded steadier than he expected. “Whole place kills service. Couldn’t send anything till I got closer to the trees.”

He pulled out his phone, thumbed through the gallery, and passed it around. Timestamped photos: the empty kitchen with its sagging counters, the scarred living-room floor with the dark stain soaked deep into the boards, the cracked ceiling with moonlight striping through. Nothing supernatural. Nothing that would make them believe him even if he tried.

Edward took the longest look, scrolling slowly, nodding once. “Clean shots. You did the full hour?”

“Yeah,” Ethan said. “Clocked it.”

Lewis held out his hand without a word. Ethan pulled the folding knife from his pocket, snapped it open once to show it was undamaged, then closed it again and handed it over hilt-first.

“Thanks,” Ethan added.

Lewis gave a short grunt that might have been acknowledgment and slipped the knife away.

Riley snorted. “Bet you pissed yourself the second the door shut, huh?""

Ethan looked at him—really looked. Skinny, twitchy Riley with his phone always up, chasing likes like oxygen. “Yeah,” Ethan said, a faint, tired smile tugging at his mouth. “You'd have started crying the moment the dead zone hit. No way to call your mommy.""

Riley blinked, caught off guard, then laughed too loud to cover it. “Fuck you, man.”

Dylan stayed quiet, arms crossed, glaring at the house like it had personally insulted him by not scaring Ethan badly enough. Edward clapped Ethan on the shoulder—firm, approving—and started walking back toward the trail. The others fell in around them.

The mood on the walk back was different. Lighter. Victorious. Edward kept Ethan close, asking low, almost respectful questions: How bad was the rot inside? Hear anything weird? See any signs of squatters? Each answer Ethan gave earned a nod, a “damn” under the breath, a quick grin shared with the others. They treated him like he’d come back from something real, something dangerous. Like he’d earned a seat at the table he’d been scraping under for years.

It felt good for about thirty seconds.

Then the warmth curdled.

Because he hadn’t fought anything. He hadn’t proven anything. The house—the thing inside it—had held him in its gut for an hour, watched him cry like a child, and then politely handed him his phone back and opened the door. He'd stuck his head in a lion's maw and luck or pity was the reason he was still alive.

And these four walking beside him—laughing, praising, finally seeing him—had marched him straight to its teeth for a story and some group-chat clout.

He glanced sideways at each of them as they moved single-file down the narrow trail.

Edward first: steady, controlled, always the leader because someone had to be and no one else wanted the weight. He’d known the stories longest, carried that gas mask like a trophy, and still sent Ethan in alone.

Dylan next: younger, meaner, armed now because big brother made it possible. Quick to mock, quicker to pull a trigger if it made him feel bigger.

Riley: filming everything, performing everything, terrified of being irrelevant for even a second.

Lewis: cold transactions only, loyalty for sale to the highest bidder or the best alibi.

Each of them had played their part in pushing him through that door tonight. Each of them would do it again if it served them.

He pictured saying it out loud—these brutal, sharp assessments that rose unbidden in his mind, unlike anything he’d ever allowed himself to think so clearly. He imagined their reactions: Edward’s quiet freeze, Dylan’s instant rage, fists or worse, Riley’s frantic deflection, Lewis reaching inside his coat.

Violence. Immediate, predictable.

But the thought didn’t frighten him the way it once would have.

It felt… trivial.

Small.

The same way their whole little hierarchy must look to her—five desperate boys scrabbling for dominance in the dark, willing to feed one of their own to a nightmare just to feel brave for a night.

She was still in there. Alone. Trapped in walls and hunger and whatever had made her this way.

And she had warned him anyway.

Ethan exhaled slowly, the trail colder around him.

The path narrowed, roots snaking across the dirt like they were trying to slow him down. No one spoke now. The joking had thinned somewhere between the clearing and the trees. The only sounds were boots on damp leaves and the occasional snap of a twig.

Ethan’s legs felt heavy, but not from fear anymore. Just the weight of seeing everything clearly for the first time.

The trees pulled back without warning. The gravel lot appeared, the Suburban waiting under the weak security light.

Edward unlocked the doors. They climbed in without ceremony.

The drive back would be quiet. They all felt the relief of being away from that house, but only Ethan understood why.

The Suburban rolled out of the gravel lot and onto the empty road. No one spoke at first. The low thrum of the engine and the occasional click of the turn signal were the only sounds breaking the silence. Even Riley kept his phone face-down in his lap, thumb idle for once. Everyone seemed to exhale at once when the trees thinned and the first distant streetlights appeared—quiet, private relief that they were out of the woods and away from whatever stories clung to that place.

Edward drove with both hands on the wheel, eyes fixed ahead, the faint orange tip of a fresh cigarette glowing between his fingers. Lewis stared out the side window into the passing dark. Riley scrolled slowly now, but didn’t film or narrate anything. Dylan sat beside Ethan in the back, arms crossed tight, jaw working like he was chewing on something sour that wouldn’t go down.

Ethan felt Dylan’s glances—quick, sideways flicks that lingered a second too long. Envy, plain and sharp. The kid had wanted the spotlight tonight, wanted to be the one Edward nodded at with that rare, quiet respect. Instead, Ethan had walked out whole and suddenly mattered.

For a moment Ethan almost pitied him. Almost. Dylan was just a younger version of the same trap—chasing approval from the only people who doled it out, no matter the cost. But the pity didn’t stick. It slid off like everything else tonight.

Ethan leaned his head against the cool window and watched the city limits approach, smears of light on wet pavement. He wondered, distantly, what his mother would say when he got home. Probably nothing. She’d be passed out on the couch again, bottle tipped over, TV blaring infomercials to an empty room. Maybe she’d stir long enough to slur something bitter about him waking her up. Or maybe she wouldn’t stir at all.

He closed his eyes for a moment and saw pink veins fading into wood grain.

The Suburban slowed. Edward pulled up in front of the house without a word. The porch light was on—Ethan had left it that way—and the front door stood slightly ajar, the way it always did because the frame had warped years ago.

“Later, man,” Edward said, lifting two fingers off the wheel in a lazy salute.

The others barely looked up. Taillights disappeared down the street, taking the last of the night’s false triumph with them.

Ethan stood on the sidewalk a moment, keys cold in his hand. The house looked exactly as he’d left it, but something felt off. Every light inside blazed—living-room lamp, kitchen overhead, hallway sconce he never used. The TV muttered loudly through the screen door, some late-night shopping channel hawking knives that could cut through pennies. And he could hear the kitchen faucet running full blast from the porch.

He stepped inside and shut off the sink first. Water circled the drain in faint pinkish swirls before clearing.

“Mom?”

No answer. Just the TV host’s enthusiastic pitch echoing down the hall.

He followed the trail: a smear of drool across the hardwood, then a thicker, sour streak of vomit that started near the couch and wandered toward the bathroom. The smell hit him halfway down the hall—booze, bile, something metallic underneath.

She was on the bathroom floor, wedged between the toilet and the tub, one arm flung out like she’d been reaching for the sink. Eyes half open, staring at nothing. Skin already cool when he knelt and touched her cheek. Vomit crusted at the corner of her mouth. An empty bottle of cheap vodka lay on its side nearby, cap missing.

Ethan sat back on his heels. No scream. No tears. Just a hollow, ringing quiet in his chest that felt both familiar and brand new.

He called 911. Told the dispatcher what he found, voice flat and calm in a way that surprised even him. They asked if he’d tried CPR. He hadn’t. He knew better.

The next hours blurred into fluorescent lights and careful questions. Police, paramedics, a detective who smelled like coffee and cigarettes. Statements taken in the kitchen while strangers moved through the house with quiet efficiency. Edward texted once—heard sirens, everything good?—and when Ethan said his mom was dead, the group chat filled with shocked emojis and offers to come over. Ethan told them the cops needed his alibi for the night. They corroborated without hesitation: yeah, he was with us till after midnight, dare at the old house, got home around one.

Clean. Simple. No one asked why a nineteen-year-old was out playing truth-or-dare in the woods.

They zipped her into a bag and carried her out just before dawn.

Ethan stood in the doorway and watched the taillights of the coroner’s van disappear, the porch light flickering once before steadying.

The house settled around him—ordinary creaks, the hum of the refrigerator, the TV still muttering in the living room.

He turned off the lights one by one, leaving only the hallway sconce burning, and sat on the bottom stair until the sun came up.

Time slowed after that.

Days bled together in a gray administrative haze that felt both endless and unreal. Funeral arrangements on a budget that didn’t exist—cremation, no service, a small notice in the local paper no one would read. A lawyer in a cramped strip-mall office explained the reverse mortgage, the medical bills, the credit cards maxed out in both their names. The house was officially Ethan’s now, but mortgaged to the hilt, debts deferred only long enough for the next notice to arrive. A small life-insurance payout barely covered the cremation and left nothing for the rest.

He cleaned in silence, moving through the rooms like a ghost himself. Boxed her clothes for donation—faded sweaters that still smelled of smoke and cheap gin. Scrubbed the bathroom floor until his knuckles bled raw, the sour stench of vomit lingering no matter how much bleach he poured. Hauled trash bags to the curb late at night so the neighbors wouldn’t stare. Found stashed bottles in places he hadn’t known existed—inside winter boots, behind cleaning supplies under the sink, one even taped beneath a drawer. He poured them out one by one, the sharp smell rising like old accusations he no longer had the energy to answer.

The group chat went quiet after the first wave of “sorry man” messages and shocked emojis. No one invited him out. He didn’t reach out either.

Some nights he sat in the dark living room with the TV off, listening to the house settle around him. Ordinary creaks and groans. The hum of the refrigerator. No sweetness in the air. No notes drifting down from the ceiling. He kept expecting grief to hit—some crashing wave of sorrow or rage or even relief. But mostly he felt hollowed out, like something had already taken its bite and left the rest to rot slowly.

And in the quiet, when the city sounds faded and the walls felt too thin, his mind drifted back to the clearing. To a soft voice asking why he was risking his life for a dare. To a single red eye watching without judgment while he cried.

He wondered, more than once, what she would say if she knew his mother was gone.

He wondered why the thought didn’t scare him the way it should.

Late one night, while boxing the last of her things in the cluttered bedroom, he found the old Rawlings glove he’d left on his bed the night of the dare. Still in the exact center of the unmade sheets, leather untouched, waiting patiently for a game that would never happen.

He stared at it for a long time.

Then he carried it downstairs and set it on the kitchen table, palm up, like an offering he no longer knew how to give.

Weeks dragged into the same gray routine. The legal matters settled slowly—debts deferred again, the house officially in his name but still drowning. The group chat flickered back to life one afternoon with a casual “yo you good?” from Riley. Then Edward: need hands tonight. Easy job. Vacation place up north, owners gone till spring.

Ethan said yes before he thought about it.

They fell back into rhythm. Semi-legal jobs: breaking into seasonal homes with busted alarms, stripping copper or grabbing unattended electronics. Hauling “found” furniture for cash under the table. Moving suspicious boxes for people Lewis knew—whatever Edward declared necessary. No one mentioned the dare anymore, or the house in the woods. Ethan’s newfound status lingered like a thin coat of respect, enough to keep the worst barbs away. Dylan still shot envious glares, but quieter now. Riley filmed less when Ethan was around.

Combined with what he made from his real job, it paid enough to keep the lights on. Enough to ignore the hollow evenings.

One afternoon, knee-deep in his mother’s cluttered bedroom—boxing faded clothes that smelled of smoke and regret—Ethan found the satellite internet dish tucked behind a stack of unopened mail. A sleek, white receiver mounted on a collapsible tripod, cables coiled neatly. The invoice was clipped to the setup guide: an early adopter promo, absurdly cheap three-year lock-in, hardware free after thirty-six months. She’d signed up almost three years ago. One final payment—about a hundred bucks—and it would be his, no strings.

He scowled at the regular cable bill still coming in. They already had wifi. This was pointless. Wasteful. Classic her.

He almost canceled the old service. Then an idea hit—stupid, reckless, throbbing behind his eyes like a migraine.

That night he dug out his old iPhone, the one he’d never traded in. Dust in the ports, battery swollen but functional. Ordered an extra charger, a handful of high-capacity power banks. He sat at the kitchen table for hours, head pounding, typing and re-typing the instructions on printer paper that curled at the edges.

Mount dish with clear view of sky (south-facing if possible)  
Connect cable to phone first, then power on  
Turn on only at night—cooler temps = longer battery life  
Power banks last \~8-10 hours each; rotate to charge dish and phone  
Wifi name and password are pre-saved on the phone  
To save power, close all apps except Messages

He added crude diagrams—arrows showing ports, a numbered startup sequence. Tested the setup in his living room twice, rewriting estimates when the banks drained faster than promised. Even taped a laminated card to the phone case with the bullet points in bold.

Only after sealing the Amazon box with the last strip of tape did the oversight hit him.

He hadn’t written down his own number. No phone number, no iCloud address, no “text me here.” Nothing.

Ethan sat back in the chair, staring at the taped cardboard. The headache pulsed harder.

Why had he done this?

The impulse had felt simple: he wanted to talk to someone… normal. Absurdly, impossibly normal. Someone who didn’t want anything from him, who had asked him a real question and waited for the answer.

But the justification was messier.

She had let him complete the dare. Let him sit the hour, take the pictures, walk out a “hero” to those idiots waiting in the trees—even after he’d pulled Lewis’s knife on her, shaking and crying like a child. Yet he’d only pulled the knife because she’d sealed the door first. And she’d only opened it again because… what? If he’d vanished, his friends would have called the police, wouldn’t they? Eventually. Or would they have just driven off, told a ghost story, and forgotten him by morning?

He didn’t know anymore.

He thought of his mother, alone on the bathroom floor that same night. Somewhere between the moment he stepped out of the house and the moment he found her cooling body, she had slipped away. No exact timestamp. No one to hold her hand or even notice. There was no love lost between them—hadn’t been for years—but the grief still came in cold, delayed waves. Not for the woman she’d been at the end, but for the hole where a mother should have lived. Bills, wills, lawyers, debts: the paperwork of absence.

He thought of the wrapped figure on the living-room floor, red eye steady while he sobbed.

She had said she understood impulses. That in a sane world she would have thanked him for carrying her through the rain.

Maybe both of them had acted for selfish reasons that night. He’d carried her to feel like the good guy for once, to prove something to himself. She had humored the dare for… what? To watch human stupidity up close? To feed later, when the time was right? Or just because letting him go cost her nothing?

Maybe it was all instinct. He was an animal pulled by ego and fear, and she was… who knew?

Or maybe it didn’t have to mean anything at all.

If he left his number off the instructions—if he never told her how to reach him—it could stay clean. A gift with no expectation. Proof that they could do something for each other and ask nothing back, the way she had implied when she opened the door.

Ethan grinned in the quiet kitchen, a small, tired curve of his mouth.

That was clever. Safe too. It was probably for the better. However long the batteries lasted, that was more than anyone else was offering her.

He left the box without adding a single contact detail.

The next afternoon, Ethan drove out on his day off. The woods looked almost welcoming in daylight—sunlight slanting through bare branches, a light wind stirring the leaves into soft applause, birds calling back and forth like nothing sinister had ever happened here. The gravel lot was empty except for his Civic, check-engine light still glaring on the dash.

He carried the taped Amazon box in both arms, the weight of it oddly comforting—power banks shifting slightly inside like a heartbeat. The trail felt shorter than he remembered, the ground firm and dry after days without rain.

The clearing opened ahead, and the house waited.

It looked smaller in the sun, almost pathetic: gray siding peeling in long curls, vines thick but brittle, roof shingles curled like old fingernails. The windows stared blankly, plywood warped but holding. No movement. No faint sweetness on the breeze. Just the smell of damp earth and decaying leaves.

Completely empty.

No warmth radiating from the walls. No subtle pulse under the boards. No sense of being watched. It was just a house—abandoned, rotting, indifferent.

Ethan climbed the three creaking steps to the front porch. The boards groaned under his weight but didn’t yield or soften. He set the box down gently on the warped threshold, right in front of the splintered door. The cardboard looked absurdly bright against the gray wood.

He hesitated, then knocked three times—firm, deliberate raps that echoed hollowly inside and died quickly.

Nothing.

No rustle overhead. No note drifting down. No door easing open on its own. No red eye appearing in a crack.

The house stayed silent, as empty as it had ever appeared to anyone else.

Ethan waited a full ten seconds, cheeks burning with the sudden, sharp embarrassment of standing on a monster’s doorstep like a delivery boy. The absurdity crashed over him fully now: knocking on a living predator’s door in broad daylight, leaving a gift it might not even want.

He turned and walked away fast, boots crunching leaves, not quite running but close. By the time he reached the car his face was hot and his stomach twisted with regret. The drive home was a loop of self-berating questions—money wasted, time wasted, sanity slipping.

That evening he collapsed on the couch in the dim living room, TV off, phone in hand out of habit, scrolling nothing.

A new iMessage notification slid down from the top of the screen—green bubble, no contact name, just an iCloud address.

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
You looked terrible.

Ethan’s breath caught. He sat up slowly, heart thudding heavy and deliberate.

He typed before his brain caught up.

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
Who is this?

The reply came almost instantly.

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
You're the mailman. Figure it out.

He exhaled a shaky laugh that hurt his throat.

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
Your name is Constance?

Read. Then a thumbs-down reaction.

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
It's from a movie.

He searched it quickly—Monster House. Woman became encased in cement in the foundation of her home. Her soul haunted the house and...and ate people that got too close, especially children. The movie ended when three kids destroyed the house with dynamite. How the hell was the movie PG?

The name of the woman haunting the house was Constance Nebbercracker.

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
A little on the nose imo

Another thumbs-down.

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
What do you want?

He stared at the question, the same one she’d asked in the living room, soft and sad, while pink rippled under bandages.

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
Figured being cut off out there gets lonely.

Typing bubble. Gone. Back again.

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
How much did all of this cost?

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
Nothing for me. My mom bought it years ago when we didn't need it. Now it's paid off. Promo thing.

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
You stole this from your mom?

Ethan’s throat tightened.

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
My mom's gone. She passed away the night of the dare. Alcohol poisoning. She was gone by the time I got back to my own house.

Read. A long silence stretched—two minutes, three.

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
I'm sorry. Is that what you wanted to tell me?

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
I wasn't expecting to tell you anything. My number wasn't in the package. How'd you get it?

Another long pause.

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
What?

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
Your number and address are on whitepages.com. Most people's are.

Ethan blinked at the screen.

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
How'd you get my last name?

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
Siri...I asked your phone when I had it the other night.

Ethan was amazed that she knew about iphones and the internet. For some reason he'd assumed she was...he wasn't expecting her to know things about technology he didn't.

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
You can do that?

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
Yeah. I thought you wanted to talk to me.

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
I'm not saying I don't, but that wasn't the goal.

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
What is the goal?

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
We do things for each other without a goal in mind. Isn't that our thing?

The typing bubble flickered on and off for minutes. Ethan set the phone on his chest and stared at the dark ceiling, listening to the house creak around him—ordinary creaks, nothing more.

Fifteen minutes passed.

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
Don't take this the wrong way. I want to be grateful, and I mean it when I say I'm sorry about your mom. But you are so completely out of your depth that you're starting to think down is up. So I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt. Nobody is this deliberate for no reason. Tell me what you want from me. Please don't me ask again.

He read it twice. The words landed heavy, not angry—tired.

He thought for a long moment.

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
I want two things. I want to know what to call you.

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
Make something up then.

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
Do you have a real name.

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
Ask a different question.

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
How about Constance?

A pause. Then, to his amazement, she gave his message a thumbs-up.

\*\*[constancenebbercracker@icloud.com](mailto:constancenebbercracker@icloud.com)\*\*  
Sure. What else?

Ethan renamed her in his phone. He thought a long time before he said what he was considering next. He scrolled through his other messages.

\*\*Ethan:\*\*  
You said an hour was long enough to be safe?

\*\*Constance\*\*  
Yes. Why?

Ethan stared at the screen a long time. None of his friends had said anymore more than a passing I'm sorry. None of them ever texted him directly. He closed his eyes, ignored every voice in his head except the one telling him what he wanted in that singular instant.

He sent the message without looking at it, hoping auto-correct would not let him down.

**What’s up brothers.**

I’ll be sharing new discoveries. I know some of this may be misunderstood, but I also know deep down that at least one person will resonate with it.

If you want context, you can read my previous [60](https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1og2bsa/60_days_the_island_of_misfit_toys_and_the_money/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), [90](https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1p3h77i/90_days_the_island_of_the_unknown_repeatable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and [100](https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1pby6zf/100_days_welcome_to_the_new_reality_1m_dollar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) day reports.

Now to the most intense, terrifying, and inspiring part of this one hundred twenty day streak.

# Visual and perceptual changes

I started noticing brief photo-flash–like visuals appearing where there should be none. Buildings, cars, street corners. Completely random. This happened several times.

For context, I do not drink or use drugs.

# Manifestation speed increased

One night I thought for a few seconds that it would be nice to have a business partner from China.

The very next day at a crowded event, a man approached me out of nowhere. He turned out to be from China and was actively looking for a new partner as well.

# Female reactions

One time a girl opened the door of my building for me. When I looked at her, her hand froze on the door handle. She stayed there almost hypnotized for about fifteen seconds until I told her she could let go.

The look she gave me felt like she had just met a celebrity. I had never seen her before.

# Synchronicities that made me pause

I checked the Instagram of a girl I had not seen in about three years. I thought to myself how crazy it was that she was already married and had a baby.

Later that same day, I randomly chose a UPS location I had never been to. I parked, stepped out, turned my head, and saw that same girl standing there with her husband.

That one shook me.

# Intuition and bodily perception

I go to church where there are two pastors. One younger, one older.

When the younger one preaches, my body feels relaxed and open.

When the older one speaks about purity and God, my body feels heavy and tense. I experience strong intuitive discomfort around him. I am not accusing or claiming facts, only describing consistent bodily reactions that I did not have before.

# Social dynamics shift

Every space I enter feels elevated.

At events, people behave as if they are programmed to treat me kindly and helpfully. It feels automatic.

At the same time, I notice random tests appearing. For example, a drunk girl appearing out of nowhere in a remote place, exactly my type, clearly ready to hook up the same day or next if I pushed it.

These moments feel deliberate.

# Urges and cycles

Weather and lunar cycles definitely affect urges.

On gloomy days, sexual energy spikes aggressively. From experience, I know it passes within a couple of days.

# Family dynamics

My relationship with my mother has shifted.

She both fears and respects me. I can calmly dismantle arguments or silence them respectfully with eye contact alone. No words needed.

# The celebrity effect

At a business café event, a random man approached me and thanked me for creating the space.

He thought I was the owner.

The long-streak celebrity effect is real.

# Possible twin flame experience (with caution)

At a place I frequent, a girl who works at the bar caused a physical sensation in my chest the first time we met. Not lust. Not objectification. More like familiarity and calm.

I tried to dismiss it, but the feeling returned repeatedly. After a small interaction where she paid for my matcha and joked about ancient souls, something clicked.

Her presence eases my nervous system.

That said, I remain extremely cautious. At these stages, illusions can appear disguised as something sacred but I keep thinking about her without being lustful for the first time ever and her energy feels like home..

# Competitiveness and jealousy increase

Retention intensifies competitiveness.

I see people online traveling freely, living comfortable lives, while I’ve spent years grinding without vacations. Instead of collapsing, it sharpens me.

I plan my days with surgical precision.

The same happens when I attend student business events in LA. Students at elite universities live with financial safety and calm nervous systems. They may lack grit, but the peace money provides is real.

That peace is something I want.

# Sales performance shift

I do cold calling. English is not my first language and I have an accent.

When I was relapsing, people hung up within seconds.

On retention, trust forms quickly. People share addresses, bills, sensitive information. One woman invited me for coffee the same day and became a business partner.

If you are in sales, retention is non-negotiable. I strongly believe that most of the PMO guys have financial issues always. 

# The penalty system of lust

There is a lust and indulgence penalty built into reality.

Just like traffic laws.

With PMO and compulsive lust, the penalties are universal:

* unexpected car problems
* job instability
* streaks of bad luck

This does not surprise me anymore.

# Patterns and symbols

Once I crossed certain streak lengths, repeating numbers began appearing everywhere. License plates, clocks, receipts.

It feels similar to music theory. Once your awareness sharpens, patterns become obvious.

Animals feel different too. Bird sounds feel meaningful in a way I cannot yet fully articulate.

# Exposure and accountability

I believe we are observed on a deeper level.

Things done years ago eventually resurface. Even the smartest people cannot escape it. Exposure often follows relapse.

# Friendships fall away

A friend of fifteen years no longer resonates with me.

Only now do I see our communication was filled with negativity, sexual content, and stagnation. When I was depleted, it felt normal. Now it feels empty.

I reduced communication and do not miss it.

# SAA dynamics

I attend SAA meetings. Recently, after my shares, I notice aggression and defensiveness.

When I speak about bad luck patterns, some laugh loudly. I understand. I was the same before.

Different frequencies create different perception.

# Spiritual sensitivity increases

I started reading about spiritual guides and archangels.

When I do certain exercises before sleep, I hear subtle sounds and feel presence. Even while driving, I sense accompaniment.

I am describing perception, not making claims.

# Rewards after discipline

Every urge you overcome feels like passing a difficult exam.

After overcoming a strong urge recently, the very next day I was invited to a venture capital event and handed a microphone to pitch my startup.

People with serious capital approached me afterward.

# Final thought

Retention catapults you into a different frequency where people want to help you.

Once you relapse, it feels like certain doors temporarily close, no matter how hard you knock.

This isn’t just about dating, but that’s where the behavior becomes most intense. Recently, I’ve been talking to a guy I haven’t met yet, but we’ve been communicating regularly and there’s mutual interest. He’s younger than me and very attractive, which seems to make my friend especially anxious.

From the moment I mentioned him, she began asking me for updates constantly — whether he’d texted, whether he’d called, what he said, how often we talk. It wasn’t casual curiosity, it was every few hours. If I didn’t have an update, she would keep circling back to it. It started to feel intrusive and stressful, like my dating life was being monitored. Eventually, I stopped sharing updates altogether because I didn’t feel comfortable anymore, but she still asks.

She questions why I’m interested, implies that dating “for fun” isn’t appropriate at my age, and seems frustrated when I’m not anxious or desperate to settle down.

Beyond dating, there’s a broader pattern of unkindness. She frequently makes small but pointed comments about my life and finances. I often cover small things like coffee for her because I like to treat my friends. Recently, we went out to eat and she asked me to pay, saying she’d send me the money on venmo. Afterward, she said she didn’t have the payment app on her phone and would send it another way later, but it never happened. We continued to spend time together after that, and while I didn’t bring it up immediately, she also didn’t offer to cover anything or acknowledge it.

Later, when I mentioned that I was trying to be more mindful about spending and asked for her to pay me back, she responded by pointing out how often I get my hair or nails done. That comment felt more like a judgment about how I choose to spend my money — especially given that I had been covering shared expenses.

She’s also made comments about my life choices that felt unnecessarily harsh. In front of friends, she criticized me for not settling down and implied that because I’m in my 30s, I should be more worried about having children. She said that after 35 it becomes be very difficult medically speaking. Regardless of the facts, it felt like a cruel thing to say publicly. When I pushed back and referenced a recent article that came out challenging that idea, she argued that the article said the opposite until I showed her the article, after which she went quiet.

What’s bothering me most is the pattern, anxiety about my dating life that turns into intrusion, subtle digs about money, and comments that make me feel judged or small. I leave interactions with her feeling tense and guarded rather than supported.

1pspu21,https://i.redd.it/w2v2qiyaio8g1.jpeg,Strategies for dual challenge: noise reduction + hearing assistance? (audiogram included),"Hi everyone,

I’m 75M and recently got Rexton Reach hearing aids after noticing I frequently need to ask people to repeat themselves, especially my wife (female voice frequencies are particularly challenging). I also have trouble in coffee shops, etc. I’m looking for advice on managing what seems to be a dual challenge.

\*\*My situation:\*\*

\- Live in an apartment with constant background noise from a ventilation system

\- Sometimes need noise reduction or cancelling, sometimes need hearing assistance

\- Currently have open domes on my Rexton Reaches

\- Own AirPods Pro 2 and testing Pro 3 - their noise cancellation works great for blocking background noise, and I can switch to transparency/hearing aid mode when needed

\- However, I suspect my hearing loss may be too significant for AirPods to work well as actual hearing aids (see audiogram)

\*\*What I’ve tried:\*\*

\- Adjusting Rexton profiles and directionality to avoid amplifying background noise, but I don’t think I’m effectively \*reducing\* it

\*\*Questions:\*\*

1. Would switching to closed domes on my Rextons help with background noise reduction or cancellation?

1. Are there programming adjustments that could better balance noise reduction vs. amplification for my specific loss pattern?

1. Is there a viable strategy for using both devices (Rextons for hearing assistance, AirPods for noise cancellation) or should I focus on optimizing one solution?

1. Given my audiogram, are the AirPods Pro realistic as hearing aids, or am I expecting too much from them?

(split on preferred drink types but will have at least 2-3 cups a day)

So I have officially decided to go down this apparently massive rabbit hole called at home espresso making, the thing is, that means I now need to buy all the stuff, I am aware of the famous ""the grinder is more important than the maker"" motto which is why I want to check in with you, the pros.

My kitchen is small... very small and although I have really decent storage space, it's the surface area where I struggle and I know that at least the espresso machine will pretty much be stationery and a staple in my kitchen (grinder and eventual pour over stuff can be stored easily) which is why I am leaning for a small maker such as the Bambino Plus that's both thin and short, however that is not my priority (I inherited a really old Krups Espresso machine that can soooort of do the trick for now).

My research for grinders is where my indecision is living right now, overall I am seeing four names pop out the most in online ""best of"" lists: The Baratza Encore ESP, the OXO Conical Burr, the Breville Smart Grinder Pro and the Fellow Opus (all of which just so happen to fit in my estimated budget), this grinder will be my grinder for all coffee brewing I intend to do, from espresso, to pour over, to automatic drip, to cold brew, so I need this bad b- to do it all.

I would love to hear thoughts from actual people who have had and used both the grinders as well as the Bambino Plus, if you think it's great, if you think it sucks (and why), or if you think I should have a look at another machine/grinder.

I was then given oral contraceptives again and stopped taking them in August of this year. My hair has also started falling out a bit more than usual….

I have now gone with a period to this day. I was prescribed a 10 day medication of Provera to induce a period (on day 9 today) PCP recommends to get BACK on oral contraceptives again. Should I? I want to get pregnant within the next year or two…

My family and I are planning to attend Disneyland sometime after New Year’s, and I had a few questions for those who know the parks well.

1. Christmas decor:

When does Disneyland usually take down the Christmas decorations? One of my family members LOVES Christmas decor and would really like to experience it if possible. Are there still decorations up the first week or two of January?

2. Ride closures in early January:

Are there typically any rides closed during the first couple weeks of January due to holiday decor removal or refurbishments? Just trying to set expectations.

3. Can we leave Disney for a little bit and the comeback ??? Or ?? How does that work ???

4. Parades ???

Side note:

This will be our second time going, but technically our first real experience 😅 The first time we went, we only got about an hour in before a storm hit, and the next day the same thing happened. So… lots of rain, very little enjoyment. We’re really hoping for better luck this time!

And other recommendations:

•	Any must-try food?

•	Coffee recommendations (we’re a big coffee family ☕️)?

•	What rides should we prioritize first in the morning?

It was literally life-changing, I have struggled with binge disorder for decades, and when I started the Ozempic, it was like all the food noise in my head just stopped. I started wanting healthy foods. I could still eat, but it wasn’t running my life and I lost 10 pounds in a month without even trying. 

I am now in total hell and trying to figure out if this is something I’m doing wrong or if I’m just not tolerating the new dose. 

Friday, I went up to the .5 dose. I didn’t eat anything I thought was too crazy, over a 12 hour period I had a few chicken nuggets in the morning and later in the day I had some cheese and crackers with turkey lunch meat. I had a handful of trail mix and a piece of toast with some avocado on it.

I woke up a few hours later sicker than I’ve ever been in my life and after researching came to the conclusion that I had eaten too much.

I couldn’t even hold down meds or water or anything, couldn’t leave the bathroom. In my sleep, I was vomiting stomach acid and bile. (I have mixed reflux, and take omeprazole and famotidine every night. It was completely ineffective,  I was asleep and woke up in the middle of throwing up which has never happened to me before.) 

Sunday morning I thought the whole nightmare was over. I drank a small cup of coffee with a little oat milk in effort to kill my caffeine headache and I ate a banana. It went OK, just mild nausea.

Then a few hours later since I genuinely felt hungry I drank one of those Chobani yogurt drinks, and went right back to feeling like I was going to die of stomach upset. All I could do was get in bed. Now it’s 11 o’clock at night I’m hungry and absolutely dehydrated as hell but terrified to eat anything.

[$10,000]","Hey everyone — looking for opinions from people who have real time on these machines.

I’m planning to build out a coffee cart and I’m debating between a La Marzocco GS3 AV and a GS3 MP. I’m also considering a Linea Mini paired with a connected scale.

What I’m trying to optimize for is future-proofing: something I can grow into as volume increases and as my workflow gets more dialed (consistency, speed, repeatability, ability to train others later, etc.).

My questions 
•	For a coffee cart workflow, which GS3 version do you think makes more sense: AV or MP, and why? 
•	Which setup is more consistent under real service conditions (rushes, imperfect puck prep, different baristas, etc.)? 
•	Does the MP’s manual pressure profiling end up being useful day-to-day, or does it slow things down / add variability? 
•	Is the AV the better call for speed and repeatability once you’re serving customers? 
•	For those who’ve used it: does a Linea Mini + connected scale get you “close enough” in the cup and workflow to justify the smaller footprint/simplicity? 
•	Maintenance/reliability-wise for mobile use: anything you wish you knew before choosing?

Context 
•	This is for a mobile coffee cart, so I’m factoring in workflow speed & consistency. 
•	I care about great espresso, but I also need something that holds up in service and doesn’t become a bottleneck.

If you own or have worked on any of these in a service setting, I’d really appreciate your take — especially anything you’d do differently if you were buying again.

Charlotte often talks about entitled people, well I’ve got a good one for you!

Today I was visiting my sister so our kids could play together while we had coffee and chatted. She’s a groomer, so it’s rare for her to take days off.

We were sitting at the table chatting when her phone started ringing. She said, “Oh, it’s a client. I’m not answering—I’m on vacation. She’ll leave a message.” We kept talking, but the phone rang again… and again… and again—always the same client.

After a while, my sister decided to answer because it was getting annoying. The woman complained that my sister should have answered sooner. My sister explained that she was on vacation for Christmas. The woman then asked, “So when can you trim my cat’s claws? He’s due!”

My sister replied that she wasn’t working this week because it’s the holidays. The woman said, “Well tomorrow isn’t Christmas—it’s December 22.” My sister answered, “Yes, I know, but my little one doesn’t have school and I don’t have a babysitter.”

The woman replied, “WELL I CAN WATCH HIM WHILE YOU TRIM MY CAT’S CLAWS.”
(What?! She’s a client, my sister doesn’t know her personally, and her child doesn’t know her at all!)

My sister said no, thank you. She added that she wasn’t working this week, but she could take her cat on January 1st since she’d be going in to do cleaning anyway.

The woman replied, “I can’t wait that long, and I’m surprised you even work on January 1st!” Then she continued, “Now since you can't take me before January 1st, you’re going to find someone else to trim my cat’s claws.”

My sister replied, “Well ma’am, I don’t know who else could take your cat on such short notice, but I wish you good luck and Merry Christmas.”

So my mom’s friend is the girls aunt. Anyway for context on why that is important I have tried to disregard relationship setups from family because it has caused lots of stress and anxiety in the past for many reasons. So this even though not initiated by my mom felt like it was the same as before. We started talking and got along alright (all over text) and my mom being nosey constantly asked if I had anything planned this weekend, and usually she couldn’t care less what I do with my time or my plans, so it usually eluded to pressure to ask this girl out. I have not still felt connected much or attracted to her in really any way, I feel like a crappy person for feeling that way but because of experiences in the past I’m trying to not force what isn’t there. We had figured out to go for coffee but a few days before I asked her if she is still down to go and got no response, and with how I was feeling or I guess not feeling I let her know it wasn’t going to work (I sent a text the night before the day we wouldn’t gotten coffee). That was about a month ago now and sad to say I felt very relieved to discontinue what was giving me lots of anxiety. Since then my mom has made several comments about giving her another chance and this and that bringing it up in some way every few days. A few days ago I got a text from her apologizing for not communicating and that she would still want to hangout and maybe go see a movie. Despite my gut and emotions telling me to leave it where it was I responded and we are actively planning out a time to see a movie. I am very conflicted and feeling anxious and sadly depressed about this situation. She is very nice and I already feel bad for leading her on once and now a second time but to put it simply I am content right now with not being in a relationship, although prior to meeting her I thought I wanted to be in one, talking with her has made me realize to focus on family, friends and taking care of myself. Just some insight would be nice. I know there are really two options to this: 1 being call off the date and be honest, which is what I wish I could do but I just can’t get my mind to think that’s ok because I don’t want to be a jerk again. 2 go to a movie and see how it plays out, with how I am feeling communicating in person how I don’t think this should continue may be the better way to do it but also still feels wrong. So anyway, thank you for reading this far and I just really needed to let this out since the people close to me just usually pressure me into doing these types of things and now here I am.

1pspcve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pspcve/considering_divorce_does_my_husband_actually_care/,Considering divorce: does my husband actually care about me?,"Hi everyone, I’m after some perspective on my marriage. I (33F) am married to my husband (35M) for two years.

Some background - I had an unplanned pregnancy with my husband a few months into our relationship. My dad pressured me into getting married to him otherwise I would be kicked out of the family. I never wanted to get married to him because I had a gut feeling that I shouldn’t, but unfortunately I didn’t listen to it. I also married as a financial decision (I was scared of being a single mum) and it was a way of taking a chance on him as I didn’t know him very well, for my unborn child. My husband agreed to get married, he says for my sake. He never saved me from the shame by proposing to me or taking charge. 

My husband is a great dad. We live in a separate state to my family, and I don’t rely on his family (my in-laws) for support with my baby. 

The issue is that our relationship feels barren emotionally. He doesn’t know how to engage in deeper, meaningful and emotional conversations. I have to ask him for emotional intimacy. The worst part is that he doesn’t know what he’s feeling and never delves deeper to identify root causes. The only glimpses of emotional connection I feel with him are when we fight, or if I make him sad. I always doubted his interest in me because whilst we were dating he never asked me questions about myself, no curiosity about me or my opinions, never expressed interest in me other than sex.

Instances that make me feel like he just doesn’t care include: 
- When we were dating, he cut off a date to go clubbing with his friends, and told his friends on a phone call that he was “getting rid of me”. His friends only knew me by my ethnicity. 
- Whilst I was pregnant, breastfeeding and struggling to cook for myself, he never made food or anything to help me recover. When he did do a food subscription to make meals, he did two portions but they were small so he made just enough for himself. He didn’t see that there wasn’t enough food for me and up the portions.
- Hi family has attacked my character on occasion and he has never defended me. The first was when he announced the pregnancy to his extended family, and a member asked whether the baby was his. The second was when a member wished my husband happy birthday by saying that he wishes that I give my husband a good blowjob. My husband just did a love heart emoticon on that comment.
- I had a period where I was so fatigued and exhausted and he didn’t do anything and made it seem like I was tired from breastfeeding. He didn’t take it seriously. I didn’t know how to help myself but I also didn’t have a husband that looked out for me when I was so vulnerable. 
- I got food poisoning one time just as he was going to sleep and he came up to me as I was vomiting, and said “is it really that bad?” looking annoyed. He had work the next day, but he didn’t comfort me, or do anything to help me. He just looked angry that I was making noise whilst he was trying to go to sleep. 
- He planned to go out for lunch with a woman he had been sexually intimate with in the past, and didn’t see anything wrong with that even though we were married.
- He made me get rid of all my male friends, but I was pregnant, he asked to see a woman he used to go clubbing with for coffee. I said I wasn’t comfortable, then he made me feel like I was controlling and guilty, so I let him go.

If I ask him to do something, he will do it. He just has to be told what to do. This is so bizarre to me as to me, if you actually care about someone, taking care of their needs comes instinctually. I have to ask him to take care of mine. If I’m holding heavy bags, he doesn’t grab them for me. He doesn’t look out for me.

Something that has made me develop hate towards him is that he gave me HPV which developed into cervical dysplasia CIN2 (precancerous cells in the cervix). The first thing he said to me was that the majority of people have HPV, so it’s not a serious thing. He diffused blame in every single way possible, suggesting that he didn’t give it to me but my ex had cheated on me. He basically didn’t take it seriously. 

I had to get surgery on my cervix to take out the precancerous cells. My mum came to help from interstate and I developed signs of an infection, and my mum told him to call my doctor but he ignored her and asked chat gpt instead who said the symptoms were normal. I ended up getting an infection.

Am I expecting too much from him? I feel like he is trying but he doesn’t know how to take care of someone who is sick. I feel like I have to die for him to realise what he is doing is not enough. He doesn’t care enough about my needs to put himself in my situation and think what do I need. He needs me to think about everything. I told him that him making me nutritious meals and taking care of the food would help me immensely, but he just asks me to pick the recipes and do the grocery shop and then he’ll do it. He never takes the initiative.

I don’t feel like my marriage is bad enough for divorce. Or have my expectations just degenerated, am I settling for less? I feel like I will be able to tolerate my marriage for a very long time, and that’s it’s not bad enough for a divorce.

EDIT: some mitigating factors are that:
- he’s  changed a lot in our relationship because I’ve spoken up about all of these things and how they have made me feel. I don’t expect perfection, I expect effort and he is putting in more effort than before.
- I also see how much my baby loves the two of us together, and it breaks my heart that I will be taking that away from her. I don’t want her to come from a broken family.
- I also see how much my husband adores me baby. I love their relationship and don’t want to take that away from him.
- I don’t have my own place, and I don’t have the best relationship with my parents. I don’t know where I would go if we divorce. I wouldn’t have a healthy support network to lean on. I would have to do it myself. 
- I don’t like certain influences in his family and want to protect my baby from them. I feel like if I live with my husband I can at the very least control who my baby gets exposed to. Whereas if we get divorced it will be harder for me to have oversight. That lack of oversight over my baby scares me a lot.",5,1766374383.0,Marriage,11,1.0,False

1psp9ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1psp9ph/echos_of_the_void_pt_2_ajax_and_kate/,Echos of the Void pt 2 Ajax and Kate,"Jax’s voice crackled over the noise of the nearby equipment , directed at Edward with that familiar teasing lilt. “Speaking of living it down, let’s hit the mess while you’ve still got an hour, Eddie. They might have some cordial left from lunch that isn’t already on your ship.”

Edward keyed back, still chuckling. “Lead the way, you smug bastard.”

He motioned to Titus. “Come on, kid. Real food beats reheated wraps.”

The three men stepped out into the outpost’s main corridor. The decking was grated expanded steel, flexing faintly under their weight with each step, a rhythmic creak that spoke of decades of hard use, metal worn smooth by countless boots. Overhead, exposed conduits snaked like veins, flickering sodium lights casting long, wavering shadows across the bulkheads. The distant thump of refinery pumps provided a constant, heartbeat-like bass note, vibrating up through the soles of their boots. The air carried the mingled scents of hot lubricant, ozone from welding arcs in distant bays, and the faint, ever-present tang of recycled atmosphere. It took only a couple of minutes to reach the mess hall entrance: a wide hatch stenciled with faded paint reading MESS ALL SHIFTS WELCOME, the letters chipped and repainted so many times they had a layered, three-dimensional quality.

They pushed through the hatch into the spartan but warmly lit space. Eight long tables—each easily three meters—were bolted to the deck in two neat rows, their surfaces scarred by years of trays, elbows, and the occasional spilled synth-coffee burn mark. The serving line stood empty, the lunch rush long over, but the lingering aroma of garlic, simmering tomato sauce, and fresh-baked bread hung invitingly in the air, making stomachs rumble in anticipation.

Jax cupped his hands and bellowed toward the kitchen hatch, his voice booming in the quiet hall. “Anybody back there? Got an old void rat and a growing pup who need feeding!”

Before anyone could respond, a familiar blonde head appeared—Kate Adams, her braided ponytail swinging as she straightened up from whatever she’d been stirring on the stove. Her eyes locked on Edward, and the metal ladle in her hand clattered to the counter with a sharp clang. For a split second, the mess hall seemed to hold its breath.

“Eddie?” Kate’s voice was a mix of surprise and pure joy. She vaulted the low counter in one fluid motion—years of zero-g work making her movements effortless, crossing  the deck in quick strides. Edward barely had time to open his arms before she crashed into him, wrapping him in a fierce hug that lifted him slightly off his feet. She pulled back just enough to plant a quick, affectionate kiss on his lips, lingering a heartbeat longer than casual friendship would allow.

“You old asteroid hugger,” she murmured against his cheek, voice thick with emotion. “I heard Russell was inbound, but I didn’t dare hope it was you.”

Edward’s arms tightened around her waist, his scarred face softening in a way Titus had never seen. “Told you I’d be back, Katie. Just took longer than planned.”

Jax cleared his throat dramatically, grinning ear to ear. “Get a room, you two. Some of us are starving.”

Kate laughed, a bright, genuine sound that filled the hall, and finally released Edward—though her hand lingered on his arm a moment longer. She and Edward had once shared quarters on a deep-rim mining station years ago, living together in the easy intimacy of partners who understood the void’s demands. It had ended amicably when Edward accepted the instructor posting at the Guild Training Center, distance and duty pulling them apart, but the spark had never fully died.

Kate turned to one of the kitchen helpers, a young crewman wiping down counters and called out, “Rico, grab three trays of the lasagna, extra garlic bread, and bring a fresh pot of cordial to table four, yeah? These boys look half-starved.”

Rico gave a thumbs-up and vanished into the back.

Kate waved the men toward the table near the viewport. “Go sit. I’ll join you once I’m done here.”

They claimed the table—offering a stunning view of the asteroid the station orbited, its craggy surface glinting in the system sun like a massive, irregular gem. Titus settled in, watching the easy familiarity between Edward and Kate with quiet curiosity.

Mid-meal, Jax’s data pad pinged. He glanced at it, then looked up with a sly grin. “Good news and bad news, Eddie. The replacement part you brought? Off-loaded and already on its way to engineering. They’re swapping it in tonight—power should be stable by morning.”

Edward nodded approvingly. “Good. And the bad?”

Jax’s grin widened. “The faulty one you were supposed to haul back for analysis? Removal’s delayed. Engineering wants to run one more diagnostic cycle. Won’t be ready till 0700 tomorrow.”

Edward’s weathered face lit up like a torch flare, surprise, then pure delight. An unexpected overnight on station meant real bunks, real gravity, and time with old friends. “You’re kidding.”

“Nope.” Jax winked across the table at Kate, who had just emerged from the kitchen carrying a fresh pot of cordial. “Kate, looks like your favorite void-rat is stuck here till morning. Return cargo delayed to 0700.”

Kate set the pot down, her smile bright and knowing as she caught the wink. “Is that so?” She glanced at Edward, eyes sparkling with amusement. “Well, let me finish up here. You men eat your food. I’ll join you in a minute.”

She started to turn back toward the kitchen, then paused, looking directly at Titus with a mock-chastised expression. “Stars, where are my manners? So rude of me.” She extended a hand across the table. “Kate Adams. I keep the birds flying and apparently feed the strays too.”

Titus stood halfway, shaking her hand with a polite smile. “Titus Staples, ma’am. Pleasure to meet you properly.”

“Likewise, Titus.” Her grip was firm, callused from years of wrenches and plasma torches. She held his gaze a beat longer than necessary, seeing his face reminder her of someone , then released with a nod. “Welcome to the belt. Don’t let these two corrupt you too fast.”

With that, she headed back to the kitchen, but not before casting one last lingering look at Edward—a silent promise of conversation later, perhaps something more in the easy familiarity of old companions.

Titus sat back down, watching the exchange with quiet curiosity as the two older men resumed their stories, the delay turning a simple layover into an unexpected gift of time.

When plates were nearly clean, Titus rose for a refill as the pot was now empty Edward held out his empty cup. “Mind topping mine too? Please.”

Titus took both cups, heading back to the dispenser. While he was gone, Jax leaned toward Edward, voice low. “What’s with the kid? Never seen him before. Guild gear says student—brand new.”

Edward glanced toward the dispenser, making sure Titus was out of earshot. “Started yesterday. Hale put him one-on-one with me.”

Jax whistled softly. “Yesterday—and he’s already out in the belt with you? I watched him bring that brick in. Perfect three-point landing, not a wobble. Most veterans would’ve scraped paint.”

Edward’s pride was quiet but evident. “Raised around pilots. Mum works dock allocation on Phorantis. Kid rebuilt a Kestrel from junk and flew it solo out here. Twenty-two years old, Jax—and already better than half the grads I’ve seen.”

Jax’s eyes widened. “You’re serious.”

“Dead serious. Flew her through the approaches without a hitch. Hale wants me to fast-track him—says the talent’s too raw to waste in a class.”

Titus returned with the refilled cups, and the conversation shifted smoothly to neutral ground—fuel prices, upcoming guild inspections.

Jax checked his data pad again. Will be three hours delayed for final assay, but with the part swap, make it overnight. You’ve got time to rest, old man.”

Edward nodded. “Kid, you want an hour of rack time, go ahead.”

Titus started to stand. “I’ll head back to the ship—”

Jax interrupted with a grin. “We’ve got a lounge, son. Better than those hard couches. Even has a comm terminal—written messages only, no real-time. Use your ID for access. We’re not as fancy as the training center.”

He pointed down the corridor. “Hang a right out the hatch, first left, first door on the right.”

Edward added, “I’ll catch up in a bit—got a couple old friends to see.”

Titus cleared his tray, nodded thanks to Kate—who flashed him another warm smile from the serving line—and headed out. The lounge was less than a minute away—a dimly lit space with a dozen reclining chairs, a few scarred tables, and an ancient comm console against the bulkhead. A handful of off-duty personnel lounged about: three mechanics playing cards, two pilots dozing under dimmed lights.

Titus nodded politely, found an empty chair near the console, and pulled out his data pad—only to realize the outpost’s network wouldn’t sync with the newer guild encryption. He looked over at a young mechanic—maybe thirty, coveralls patched, easy smile.

“Excuse me—how do I connect? My pad’s not linking.”

The mechanic chuckled. “That new guild junk? Won’t talk to our fifty-year-old system. IT keeps promising an upgrade—‘couple weeks,’ they say, then it turns into months. Use the console over there. Stupid-simple: touch the address, type your message, hit send. No frills, but it gets there.”

Titus moved to the console, its keys worn smooth by decades of use. He entered his mother’s routing code, fingers hesitating a moment before typing:

Hi Mom,

Got to pilot a real run today with my instructor—out in the belt, about eight hours from the guild. Delivered a critical reactor coil replacement—saved the outpost from blackouts. So far, so good. Overnight delay on return cargo, so resting up here. Will be back tomorrow.

Those old pilots back home were right about everything. Tell them I said thanks. I’m flying with a guy named Edward Russell—they might know him. Some are his age.

Don’t know why they put me one-on-one with him, but I’m happy. Oh, Mom—remember that first model kit you got me? The mining transport? That’s what I’m flying now. Exact same class.

Love you,

Ti

He hit send. The console beeped confirmation—message queued for the next outbound hauler. Titus leaned back in the chair, the low hum of the station around him, and let his eyes drift closed for a few minutes. The void outside waited, patient and endless, but for now, he was exactly where he belonged.

Kate Adams ; was the kind of woman who turned heads without trying. Slim but strong from years of wrestling heavy tools and climbing shuttle frames, and yet still the tenderness of helping an injured soul , she stood just under two meters, her posture straight and confident. Her blonde hair was pulled back into a thick, practical braided ponytail that reached mid-back, strands escaping here and there to frame her face in soft wisps, often flecked with faint traces of grease or coolant that she never quite managed to wipe away completely. Her skin carried a light dusting of freckles across the bridge of her nose, earned from occasional EVA work under unfiltered starlight, and her eyes—sharp hazel with flecks of green—sparkled with intelligence and a perpetual hint of mischief. High cheekbones and a ready smile gave her an open, approachable beauty, softened by the laugh lines at the corners of her eyes and the small scar on her chin from a wrench slip years ago. In her grease-stained coveralls and apron, she looked every bit the capable station mechanic, cook , and at times the station counselor , but there was an undeniable grace in the way she moved—fluid, economical, the mark of someone comfortable in zero-g and gravity alike.

As the meal wound down, plates scraped clean and cordial cups empty, the three men rose from the table. Titus gathered trays while Jax stretched noisily, already plotting the next round of stories. Edward lingered a moment, catching Kate’s eye as she cleared nearby tables.

She straightened, wiping her hands on her apron, and fixed him with a playful but pointed stare. “You better not skip out on me tonight, Eddie Russell. I’ve got plans later—ones that involve you, a bottle of the good stuff I’ve been saving, and catching up properly.”

Edward’s scarred face broke into a slow, genuine grin, the kind that reached his eyes and softened the hard lines etched by years in the void. “Wouldn’t dream of it, Katie.”

Jax, overhearing as he stacked his tray, burst into a deep, rolling laugh that echoed through the mess hall. “Oh, this is too rich! The great Edward Russell, tamed at last. I knew this delay was too convenient—someone up there’s got a sense of humor.”

Kate shot Jax a mock glare, but her lips twitched with amusement. “Keep laughing, Jax. I know where you sleep.”

Titus, trays balanced, hid his own smile as he headed for the disposal chute, giving the old friends their moment. The easy affection between Edward and Kate was impossible to miss—old flames rekindled by proximity, comfortable and familiar as a well-worn flight jacket.

Edward clapped Jax on the shoulder. “All right, you old gossip. Lead on to whatever trouble you’ve got planned next.”

But his gaze lingered on Kate a second longer, promise unspoken in the air. The overnight delay had just become the best part of the run.",1,1766374112.0,OpenHFY,0,1.0,False

Obviously at such an age there's lot's of immaturity but in our case it was also extremely toxic. Not in any ""abuse"" kind of way, it's just that we were both extremely mentally unwell (eating disorder, depression, suicide attempts, etc from both of us)

We had broken up suddenly due to some weird situation. It's been 5 years since then, and very recently i messaged her on friendly terms, to see what's up. We met and went for a coffee, talked about the past. She is in a relationship of 1 year, but she says she still loves me just not romantically.

I also don't love her, ""romantically"" but i do love her, but i have no idea what kind of love i have. Fantasising different kinds of love expressions towards her like touching her or hugging her, some of them feel uncomfortable while other ones ""good"". I don't feel jealous or anything either, in fact thinking that she is in a relationship impulses me to vouch for them.

But i am extremely confused. Right now, 5:15AM, I have been crying for like 5 hours. I am not sure what i am crying for exactly, but i know that it is my love and care for her.

I'm confused, i'm crying as i am feeling a ton of different, variable, hard-to-recognise emotions. My fantasies equally so. So i have been writing it down.

I want to be completely real to her, so i'm going to show her my writings and try to talk about it. I don't know how it will go, for sure, as many will think, she won't react negatively. But i fear that she might want to cut contact on good terms, something that i accept, because again i want to be real and if this reality then so be it. As long as she is happy i am happy.

i don't know why i am posting this if i am determined to do this anyways. Maybe, for advice? Or anything i should just hear. Or maybe validation that some people can relate. I don't know but either way thanks for reading and thanks for commenting in advance.",1,1766373916.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Evan Cole never planned on ending up in Charleston, South Carolina. Minor league hockey had a way of dropping you wherever the bus stopped, and this season it happened to be a city where palm trees swayed instead of pines and the air smelled like salt instead of snow. Evan played defense for the Charleston Harbor Kings—gritty, underpaid, and forever chasing the dream of something bigger.

Charleston confused him at first. It was slow where hockey was fast, warm where the rink was cold. But after practices, when he’d walk past pastel houses and horse-drawn carriages, the city started to soften the edges of a season that hadn’t gone his way.

He met Lila Hart on a Tuesday afternoon he almost skipped practice.

She worked at a small waterfront café on Shem Creek, the kind of place locals guarded like a secret. Evan wandered in still wearing his Harbor Kings hoodie, shoulders heavy with frustration. Lila noticed him immediately—not because he was tall and broad like a hockey player, but because he looked lost, like someone who hadn’t figured out where he belonged yet.

“You look like you need coffee,” she said, sliding him a mug before he even ordered.
He smiled for the first time that week.

Evan kept coming back. Sometimes after morning skates, sometimes after brutal losses. Lila learned his routine: black coffee, no sugar; hands scarred from blocking shots; eyes that lit up when he talked about the game even when it broke his heart. 
Evan learned hers too—early shifts, a love for old Charleston ghost stories, a quiet dream of opening her own bakery someday.

They became something gentle without trying. Sunset walks along the Battery. Lila sitting in the stands, wrapped in a Harbor Kings scarf, cheering louder than anyone else even when the team was down three goals. Evan teaching her to skate at the rink after hours, laughing when she clung to the boards like her life depended on it.
But hockey has a way of testing love.

When Evan got a call-up offer to a team two states away, it felt less like victory and more like a question he wasn’t sure how to answer. The offer was temporary. Uncertain. 

Just like everything else in the minors. Leaving Charleston meant leaving Lila, the first place that ever felt like more than a stop along the road.

They sat on the dock at Shem Creek that night, shrimp boats rocking gently beside them.

“I won’t ask you to stay,” Lila said, voice steady but eyes shining. “But I won’t pretend it doesn’t scare me.”
Evan took her hand, rough palm against hers. “Every time I step on the ice, I’m scared,” he admitted. “But this—this feels worth fighting for.”

He left. They called. Texted. Missed each other fiercely. Evan played the best hockey of his life and still wondered if he’d traded the wrong dream.

When the season ended, the call never came to make the offer permanent.
So Evan came back to Charleston.
He found Lila at the café, flour on her cheeks, laughing with a customer. When she saw him, she froze—then ran straight into his arms like she’d been waiting all along.

“I guess I’m home,” he said.
The Harbor Kings welcomed him back. Charleston felt warmer than ever. Evan didn’t stop chasing hockey, but he stopped believing it was the only thing that defined him.

Some nights, after games, they’d sit by the water and watch the moon reflect on the tide. Evan would lace his fingers through Lila’s and think about how love, like hockey, was about balance—knowing when to fight and when to let yourself glide.
And in a city built on history and second chances, a minor league hockey player finally found something that felt like a major win.",1,1766373852.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I have a massive workload due to Q4 and I have to lead strategy meetings for 2 hours where I need to be sharp, articulate, and quick on my feet. I cannot look like a zombie.

I'm in an open office and my schedule is back-to-back. I also have a hard time napping and creates more anxiety. 



Can anybody relate to this and how do you deal with it? What is your protocol? Is there a breathing technique, a specific supplement, or a sensory trick that snaps the brain into ""Emergency Focus Mode"" without stimulants?

Starting when she was a baby, my fiancés parents would come very early on Christmas morning so they could be there when she woke up to see her presents. My fiancé and I live together in his house and are getting married October 2026.

While discussing our Christmas plans last week my future mother in law said she will be coming over at 6am on Christmas morning like she does every year. I asked her if she would mind coming a little later, like 8 or 9 because we’re hosting 15 people for Christmas eve the night before (including MIL!). She looked me dead in the eyes and told me no, she will not miss her granddaughter opening her presents. To be clear, I wasn’t asking her to miss presents, just come later! To make it even worse, she expects coffee and breakfast and forces me and my mom (who will be staying with us for Christmas) out of bed. It’s so frustrating because I don’t have a say in my own house and the last thing I want to do is wake up at 6am to deal with her. (I don’t like her at baseline) Opinions/thoughts?

ETA: feel like this is important. My fiancé is scared to stand up to her because when he does she threatens to not babysit her granddaughter anymore. (She picks her up from school twice and week and watches her until fiancé gets home from work). ",22,1766373277.0,motherinlawsfromhell,19,0.96,False
1psoz1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1psoz1u/strange_dissociative_spiritual_psychological/,Strange dissociative / spiritual / psychological episode after therapy + breakup — looking for insight,"I’m trying to understand a very intense experience that happened about three weeks ago. I’ve already spoken with my GP, a psychiatrist, and my therapist, and none of them think I’m psychotic or manic — but I still don’t have a clear explanation for what happened.

I’m hoping people with experience in trauma, CPTSD, dissociation, or similar states might have some insight.

⸻

Background

I’ve been in therapy for about seven years. Early on I was diagnosed with CPTSD, but in the last nine months I’ve made significant progress emotionally.

In March, my girlfriend of almost four years broke up with me. She’s very avoidant. About a week later, I felt physical emotional pain in my chest for the first time in my life. That moment changed everything — I realized emotions could show up as bodily sensations. Since then, I’ve been journaling and working heavily on emotional awareness.

⸻

The trigger

Fast forward to late November, about eight months after the breakup. My ex (who had moved to NYC) came to town and asked to see me. We spent two days together, and the emotional closeness returned almost immediately. Lot’s of I love yous, hugging, holding hands, etc. We’d been talking on and off for a few weeks before that.

Two days after seeing her, I had a therapy session. While talking about the visit, a lot of emotion came up. Instead of crying, I felt waves move through my skin — similar to chills or energy. This had happened mildly before, but this time it lasted for hours after the session ended.

⸻

Things started getting strange

Later that day I felt unusually good and energized. I went to one of my favorite restaurants and chatted with the bartenders. Suddenly I became intensely aware of my heartbeat. I then had a disturbing thought where I wasn’t sure if the bartenders were normal people, angels, or demons. That scared me enough that I left and went home to sleep.

⸻

That night

As I was falling asleep, I felt a slow sensation moving up my body — almost like a charge or current. It traveled from my gut, to my heart, to my throat, to behind my eyes, and finally to my brain over about 20 minutes. At the peak, I had a strange vision related to resurrection or rebirth.

⸻

The next day

I woke up extremely confused.

I had a Zoom job interview that morning and was unusually honest and vulnerable. At one point the interviewer said, “It sounds like you might be bored of this job — what would your ideal job be?” I answered very directly and described what I actually wanted. In my mind, I briefly believed she could somehow make that happen.

I got the job.

I recorded the interview, and listening back later, I sounded completely normal — just more open than I would usually be.

⸻

Later that day

I met two former colleagues (who are also friends) at a coffee shop. I have no memory of getting ready or driving there. When I arrived, I felt extremely disoriented.

I was cold but couldn’t figure out how to manage being cold. I genuinely believed I had been “reborn” and needed to relearn how to function. I wasn’t sure if my friends were real, parts of my imagination, or something symbolic.

At one point I asked them how they remembered things after sleeping because I was afraid I wouldn’t wake up. I eventually broke down crying in the middle of the coffee shop, overwhelmed and feeling powerless.

⸻

That night

I decided it wasn’t safe for me to be alone, since I live by myself. One friend drove my car home while I rode with him. Packing for one night took me about 45 minutes because I kept forgetting what I was doing.

We went to his house, where another friend joined us. We called my therapist, which helped somewhat but also made me more paranoid. I still wasn’t sure if anyone there was “real.”

I called my ex twice — once to very honestly tell her how I felt about her, and a second time simply because her voice felt grounding. My friends commented that she seemed very kind and that they understood why I loved her.

Before sleeping, I drank more water than I ever have and called about twelve people close to me to tell them I loved them and to resolve any lingering issues. The calls felt deeply meaningful. As I fell asleep, I had the sense that the people I loved were somehow “rebuilding” my consciousness.

⸻

The aftermath

I woke up the next morning drenched in sweat but felt dramatically better. One friend confirmed that the previous day had been real. I went home via Uber.

Over the next 24 hours, missing memories slowly returned.

Now, three weeks later, I feel “normal” — but also lighter. It feels like I released a large amount of suppressed material. Presence feels almost effortless. I have more energy when running or working out, I make eye contact with people, say hi to strangers, and feel okay occupying space in the world.

⸻

What I’m trying to understand

Doctors don’t think this was psychosis or mania, but no one has a clear explanation.

I’m wondering:

	•	Was this a dissociative or derealization episode related to CPTSD?

	•	Was this some kind of ego death or nervous system release?

	•	What were the waves and bodily sensations after therapy?

	•	What was the sensation moving up my spine?

	•	What role did my ex play — trigger, attachment wound, unresolved grief?

	•	Was this delayed grief processing, trauma release, or something else?

I’m not looking for mystical validation — just grounded perspectives from people who understand trauma, dissociation, or similar experiences.

Thank you kindly for looking this over. If you would, do you mind giving this a quick glance, and telling me whether or not you find it interesting? Thank you again!

The battle came at midday. The clash, the chaos - William Barnes would never forget.

Nature was in its changing. Leaves lost their green, painted gold and brown, red and yellow. Waving in wind over fields of ripening grain, patient for coming harvest. October was halfway through. Autumn grew older, colder, nights swallowed daylight. 

William sipped his coffee, the stinging heat a respite against the cold. Beyond the window of the café, life moved on. People queued on sidewalks, around shops and restaurants, crossing the intersection of the town of Teuta, enjoying a Saturday of peace. In the distance, rolling hills stretched unto wilderness. 

It was serenity. William eyed his wristwatch. *Time to get to work*.

As a Yuben County Commissioner, he could work remotely. Setting aside meetings, councils, petitioners and deranged folk who demanded his time, common tasks required no office. Pushing his laptop computer open, it booted - slow - then flared to life. His inbox was a swamp of unread electronic mail.

He huffed, annoyed, scrolling through the endless list. “Spam… Spam… More spam… *God, it’s been a day, I have to get this cleared out*… Huh, Doctor Pearson?”

Two clicks. The mail unfolded, spilling words onto the screen. 

“*Good morning, Commissioner Barnes.* *I hope today finds you well. As is my duty, being Superintendent of Teuta School District, it is becoming of me to inform you of recent happenings, some of which have raised alarm for my staff and I.*”

 Doctor Pearson wrote as he spoke - lethargic. Where in one hundred words, five could say the same. “*Continuous fighting, alienation between peers, decreased performance of our student athletes (a subject raised time and time again), and several other niche topics that are best summed up as - not good. In fact, just yesterday, I broke up a fight between two young men, Grant Santos and Kenneth Applain. Being it a Friday, I sent them home early, but it is no less unacceptable.*”

“*Furthermore, as I walk my halls, I often hear a term I do not understand - though* *Commissioner Kelly Lindsey has informed me of its meaning. This term is ‘Grey War’, and from what I have gathered, it is some conflict happening inside our Youth Conservation Program. I am aware you have a seat on the oversight council of this very program. This is why I write you today.*”

“What does he want from me?” William held his head in his palm. That silly little program, where they spoke with that ridiculous accent, and they all pranced about like lords and laddies - what import could it possibly hold?

“*I would be very pleased to have a conversation with you and your oversight council for the YCP. Just so I may better understand the workings of-*”

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

William stopped, looked, cupped an ear. A horn, deep and distant, groaned from the trees, then vanished. His swift eyes inspected the outside of the café. Across the street, an old man stood still; a young lady pulled off her earphones, eyes fixed on the lush treeline. People were sensing something - something William was not. Yet, the wood stood still. 

When the horn was but a memory, William scoffed. Whatever it was, it could wait. *Now, where was I?*

*“Just so I may better understand the workings of our youth, and the kingdoms they rule in the woods. Or so they are called; the modern hobbies of my students are still alien to me, even after two decades. I know little of their world in the forests, but would like to know more, so I may better understand them. Yet more precisely, I fear their fantasies are affecting the real world in a negative aspect, explaining many problems we face today.*”

“*I eagerly await a response, Commissioner Barnes. And before I forget, I must offer my sympathies for what happened to young Amanda in gym class. I can assure you, we are continuously prepared for further medical problems with your daughter, if they were to happen. The last thing we want is anybody getting hurt-”*

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

There it was again - the horn. William snapped to the window, searching for a source. He spotted it. A figure atop horseback sat on a distant knoll, dark against the autumn gold and sky. One hand held a horn, the other a grip of reins. The figure lingered, only a moment, then sped down the hill before William could inspect further. Many horns began to wail.

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

*“Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

“What the heck is going on?” William muttered, shoving back his chair. Cup in hand, he made for the door, pushing it open, entering the outside chill. The wind was dead. The town of Teuta was silent. Yet far away, climbing over hilltops, there was shouting. William did his best to make out the voices.

One was dominant, that of a child. “*Oblique order! I say, form in oblique order! Hundreds to our south! Hundreds marching on our west! Form in order men - Sarpa at center, Salutes on flanks. Cavalry, take to my heel! Ride, ride! Ride for Doral!*”

There was more than speech now, a distant beat like the rap of a drum, bordering on a stampede. *Just what is going on*?

 The hills of green stood inert, the forests empty. But the drumming grew nearer. Clashes boomed in quick succession; there were so many voices, William could not differentiate. At last, they coalesced into common calls, splitting the air. 

“*House of Applain!*”

“*House of Romero!*”

“*House of Grey!*”

“Grey?” William rubbed his jaw. *Didn’t Doctor Pearson mention something along those lines… The Grey… War?*

Then - silence. The air held its breath. No more rumbling, no more shouts, just stillness. That made it all the more odd. William's grip on his coffee tightened. He wished to scream, *Just what is going on?* Those on the streets looked just as confused, planted in place, waiting for the next noise, the next action.

When at last William heaved a sigh, he felt the wind sail by. The rustle of leaves, the distant hum of bugs and tweet of birds. There was… serenity. Not a thing was out of place.

Then came the cry that shattered the air.

“*FOR THE RIDGE!*”

They surged over hilltops, a tide of spears and shields, of banners and battle cries. Riding against the wind, hooves pounding against earth, churning green and golden ground into a mess of black mud. Faster, faster they rode, then turning, mounting another knoll. From there a second host descended. Spears lowered. Shields raised. Voices wailed; the rumble was deafening.

And the two hosts *crashed.*

 Some fell. Others pressed on, hungry for battle. Flags and standards blew high in the wind , a white dove, a golden snake, a red falcon, a rearing ram. Then came the footmen, joining their brethren as they battled over black grass. 

The azure sky darkened as arrows and javelins rained, launching, falling, striking mud and men. With wooden weapons, the warriors fought hard, breaking lifeclays, taking ground. Countless voices chanted.

“*Deo victoria!*”

“*Quis similis ferro!*”

“*Suum cuique saxum!*”

“*Doral vocat*!”

For a long, terrible moment, William could only watch. They were *children*. All of them, children. Striking, falling, battling as if men at war. The uneven ground made horses slip, keel forward, struggle on the hilly terrain. Still the boys fought. When he broke free from the grip of shock, William knew at once what was happening.

“Oh, crap! *Crap!*”

His coffee fell, black spattering over white pavement. He reached for his pocket, trembling, yanking out his phone, thumb swiping, dialing. It rang - once, twice, thrice. Commissioner James Thomann picked up the other end, his voice low.

“\**Yawn*\*, What’s up, buddy-”

“They’re fighting in the town!” William cried, rushing to the door of the café. Panicked people fled into stores, restaurants, as far from the hills and forest as possible. More figures emerged - children, warriors - missiles streaking the sky. 

“They’re here, James! They’re fighting in the town! You have to get here, now!”

“Who’s doing what where?” James asked, groggy, as if awoken at midday.

“The kids! The kids are fighting in public, hundreds of them! Christ, no, that’s got to be a thousand - a thousand of them are beating the living crap out of each other! Some are on freaking horses! Horses! You gotta get over here, we have to stop this!”

“The Doral boys?” James Thomann spoke with alarm, now alert.

“Yes!” William screamed into the phone. “Get in your car and get over here!”

“Wha-Wha, where at? I'm up, I'm on the way! What street are you on?”

William paused. In the chaos, he could not think. Despite the café being his daily, he forgot where it was. Eyes searching, he spotted two road signs. They read clearly - black on white.

“Moyer-And-Main! They’re fighting here, right now, in the town! Get up and get over to Moyer-And-Main!”

“Now!”

It has been torturous to be here. He is so petty and rotten. I contribute towards groceries and he makes dinner but doesn't leave any for me. Not asking for him to make me a plate but he intentionally is eating it all up so theres nothing left for me to make a plate. If I park in the driveway and leave he moves his car to park in the driveway. He dumps out the water from the coffee pot so I have to fill it up to make a cup.

At one point he threatened my safety and my friends as well as his online friends.

The azure sky darkened as arrows and javelins rained, launching, falling, striking mud and men. With wooden weapons, the warriors fought hard, breaking lifeclays, taking ground. Countless voices chanted.

“*Deo victoria!*”

“*Quis similis ferro!*”

“*Suum cuique saxum!*”

“*Doral vocat*!”

For a long, terrible moment, William could only watch. They were *children*. All of them, children. Striking, falling, battling as if men at war. The uneven ground made horses slip, keel forward, struggle on the hilly terrain. Still the boys fought. When he broke free from the grip of shock, William knew at once what was happening.

“Oh, crap! *Crap!*”

His coffee fell, black spattering over white pavement. He reached for his pocket, trembling, yanking out his phone, thumb swiping, dialing. It rang - once, twice, thrice. Commissioner James Thomann picked up the other end, his voice low.

“\**Yawn*\*, What’s up, buddy-”

“They’re fighting in the town!” William cried, rushing to the door of the café. Panicked people fled into stores, restaurants, as far from the hills and forest as possible. More figures emerged - children, warriors - missiles streaking the sky. 

“They’re here, James! They’re fighting in the town! You have to get here, now!”

“Who’s doing what where?” James asked, groggy, as if awoken at midday.

“The kids! The kids are fighting in public, hundreds of them! Christ, no, that’s got to be a thousand - a thousand of them are beating the living crap out of each other! Some are on freaking horses! Horses! You gotta get over here, we have to stop this!”

“The Doral boys?” James Thomann spoke with alarm, now alert.

“Yes!” William screamed into the phone. “Get in your car and get over here!”

“Wha-Wha, where at? I'm up, I'm on the way! What street are you on?”

William paused. In the chaos, he could not think. Despite the café being his daily, he forgot where it was. Eyes searching, he spotted two road signs. They read clearly - black on white.

“Moyer-And-Main! They’re fighting here, right now, in the town! Get up and get over to Moyer-And-Main!”

“Now!”

1psotld,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1psotld/cat_ate_mouse/,Cat ate mouse,"I live in the Midwest and it’s been unseasonably cold. I live around a wooded area, but have not had trouble with critters until now. I’ve had at least two mice in the last month or so. One I knew about because one of my three cats left it for me, the other, well, I found its head while vacuuming.

Last week, I noticed that the litter box smelled really bad. I got a budget friendly robot, and assumed it was about time to clean it out.  But, I found the mouse head this weekend (underneath the coffee table. Cats definitely were playing with it to be there). I assume the cat(s) ate the body? I cannot find it, and no smell. I did end up cleaning out the litter box and so far the smell is gone. I read that protein rich food makes cats poo smell. 

My question is: is there anything I need to look out for? The clumps from the litter look normal and all three cats seem normal. One of the cats used to belong to someone who was an indoor/outdoor cat. I assume it was him, but I’m not sure. Is there anything I need to do prophylactically? I would need to probably treat all 3, just in case if they did need anything? ",1,1766372765.0,CatAdvice,7,1.0,False

Thank you kindly for looking this over. If you would, do you mind giving this a quick glance, and telling me whether or not you find it interesting? Thank you again!

The battle came at midday. The clash, the chaos - William Barnes would never forget.

Nature was in its changing. Leaves lost their green, painted gold and brown, red and yellow. Waving in wind over fields of ripening grain, patient for coming harvest. October was halfway through. Autumn grew older, colder, nights swallowed daylight. 

William sipped his coffee, the stinging heat a respite against the cold. Beyond the window of the café, life moved on. People queued on sidewalks, around shops and restaurants, crossing the intersection of the town of Teuta, enjoying a Saturday of peace. In the distance, rolling hills stretched unto wilderness. 

It was serenity. William eyed his wristwatch. *Time to get to work*.

As a Yuben County Commissioner, he could work remotely. Setting aside meetings, councils, petitioners and deranged folk who demanded his time, common tasks required no office. Pushing his laptop computer open, it booted - slow - then flared to life. His inbox was a swamp of unread electronic mail.

He huffed, annoyed, scrolling through the endless list. “Spam… Spam… More spam… *God, it’s been a day, I have to get this cleared out*… Huh, Doctor Pearson?”

Two clicks. The mail unfolded, spilling words onto the screen. 

“*Good morning, Commissioner Barnes.* *I hope today finds you well. As is my duty, being Superintendent of Teuta School District, it is becoming of me to inform you of recent happenings, some of which have raised alarm for my staff and I.*”

 Doctor Pearson wrote as he spoke - lethargic. Where in one hundred words, five could say the same. “*Continuous fighting, alienation between peers, decreased performance of our student athletes (a subject raised time and time again), and several other niche topics that are best summed up as - not good. In fact, just yesterday, I broke up a fight between two young men, Grant Santos and Kenneth Applain. Being it a Friday, I sent them home early, but it is no less unacceptable.*”

“*Furthermore, as I walk my halls, I often hear a term I do not understand - though* *Commissioner Kelly Lindsey has informed me of its meaning. This term is ‘Grey War’, and from what I have gathered, it is some conflict happening inside our Youth Conservation Program. I am aware you have a seat on the oversight council of this very program. This is why I write you today.*”

“What does he want from me?” William held his head in his palm. That silly little program, where they spoke with that ridiculous accent, and they all pranced about like lords and laddies - what import could it possibly hold?

“*I would be very pleased to have a conversation with you and your oversight council for the YCP. Just so I may better understand the workings of-*”

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

William stopped, looked, cupped an ear. A horn, deep and distant, groaned from the trees, then vanished. His swift eyes inspected the outside of the café. Across the street, an old man stood still; a young lady pulled off her earphones, eyes fixed on the lush treeline. People were sensing something - something William was not. Yet, the wood stood still. 

When the horn was but a memory, William scoffed. Whatever it was, it could wait. *Now, where was I?*

*“Just so I may better understand the workings of our youth, and the kingdoms they rule in the woods. Or so they are called; the modern hobbies of my students are still alien to me, even after two decades. I know little of their world in the forests, but would like to know more, so I may better understand them. Yet more precisely, I fear their fantasies are affecting the real world in a negative aspect, explaining many problems we face today.*”

“*I eagerly await a response, Commissioner Barnes. And before I forget, I must offer my sympathies for what happened to young Amanda in gym class. I can assure you, we are continuously prepared for further medical problems with your daughter, if they were to happen. The last thing we want is anybody getting hurt-”*

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

There it was again - the horn. William snapped to the window, searching for a source. He spotted it. A figure atop horseback sat on a distant knoll, dark against the autumn gold and sky. One hand held a horn, the other a grip of reins. The figure lingered, only a moment, then sped down the hill before William could inspect further. Many horns began to wail.

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

*“Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

“*Vrooooooongggggguuuuuooooooooo…”*

“What the heck is going on?” William muttered, shoving back his chair. Cup in hand, he made for the door, pushing it open, entering the outside chill. The wind was dead. The town of Teuta was silent. Yet far away, climbing over hilltops, there was shouting. William did his best to make out the voices.

One was dominant, that of a child. “*Oblique order! I say, form in oblique order! Hundreds to our south! Hundreds marching on our west! Form in order men - Sarpa at center, Salutes on flanks. Cavalry, take to my heel! Ride, ride! Ride for Doral!*”

There was more than speech now, a distant beat like the rap of a drum, bordering on a stampede. *Just what is going on*?

 The hills of green stood inert, the forests empty. But the drumming grew nearer. Clashes boomed in quick succession; there were so many voices, William could not differentiate. At last, they coalesced into common calls, splitting the air. 

“*House of Applain!*”

“*House of Romero!*”

“*House of Grey!*”

“Grey?” William rubbed his jaw. *Didn’t Doctor Pearson mention something along those lines… The Grey… War?*

Then - silence. The air held its breath. No more rumbling, no more shouts, just stillness. That made it all the more odd. William's grip on his coffee tightened. He wished to scream, *Just what is going on?* Those on the streets looked just as confused, planted in place, waiting for the next noise, the next action.

When at last William heaved a sigh, he felt the wind sail by. The rustle of leaves, the distant hum of bugs and tweet of birds. There was… serenity. Not a thing was out of place.

Then came the cry that shattered the air.

“*FOR THE RIDGE!*”

They surged over hilltops, a tide of spears and shields, of banners and battle cries. Riding against the wind, hooves pounding against earth, churning green and golden ground into a mess of black mud. Faster, faster they rode, then turning, mounting another knoll. From there a second host descended. Spears lowered. Shields raised. Voices wailed; the rumble was deafening.

And the two hosts *crashed.*

 Some fell. Others pressed on, hungry for battle. Flags and standards blew high in the wind , a white dove, a golden snake, a red falcon, a rearing ram. Then came the footmen, joining their brethren as they battled over black grass. 

The azure sky darkened as arrows and javelins rained, launching, falling, striking mud and men. With wooden weapons, the warriors fought hard, breaking lifeclays, taking ground. Countless voices chanted.

I recently had an anxiety attack at work, so I went out to the public parking lot behind my office and smashed a coffee mug on the pavement. No one from my office saw it, but a couple people from another office did see it. These were not people I knew, but they came out and talked me down, and I cleaned up the pieces.

I had also broke something a year earlier in my office, and had been warned that this absolutely could not happen again. So at least with the recent incident, I had the good sense to leave the premises and go to the back parking lot.

But even though no one from my office saw the recent parking lot incident, in a very stupid and panicky move, I voluntarily disclosed the incident. And in my email, I offered my resignation in lieu of termination. My resignation was not accepted, and by some miracle, no discipline was imposed. So I’m still in the job. Maybe I disclosed this incident because I was worried that one of the observers would contact my office and complain about my conduct, so I wanted to get ahead of it. Or maybe I thought I deserved to get fired, with a healthy mix of imposter syndrome going on.

So the question is, where do I go from here? I do like my job, which is as an attorney at a nonprofit. I’ve been there 10 years and have been promoted to a supervisory role. The last couple years is actually the first time I have ever felt like I’m decent at my job. So I don’t know why I’ve been struggling with anxiety so badly during this same time period. The people I supervise constantly message me throughout the day, mostly with questions that are relatively insignificant that they should be able to figure out on their own. But it totally breaks any flow I have working on my own cases. The constant notifications, plus zoom fatigue, and the constant billing in 0.1 hour intervals is causing a fair amount of mental exhaustion, even in a regular work day. Finally, I have been very conflicted-avoidant, and even mild disagreements or confrontations send me into a spiral. My solution to my project’s persistent failure to meet its deliverables has just been to give myself more work rather than hold anyone else accountable.

So clearly, the problem is me, but I just don’t know what to do now. Having stupidly offered my resignation, even when it was not accepted, I’m basically walking around in fear that I’ll be fired. I’ve handed my employer everything they would need to take me out at any minute if they want, but only by their good grace they haven’t.

6. Also I have to take driving lessons.

I do enjoy luxury travels business class(health issue is one of the reasons), hence haven't been able to save much.

I grew up poor and not been financially trained well, however I do want to retire early while maintaining this lifestyle.

I just wanted an honest guidance, or advice to maximise my savings. I am trying to be more smart about my expenses and all. I am quite smart in my field and I could change my job and increase my income but my health issues prevent me to take this risk because I might have to go under surgery anytime.

I don't plan to live a luxurious lifestyle but as as long as I can afford my medical care and quality grocery and one a year travel I am good.

I know the apartment value will not increase but it is in central CBD so hopefully rent will be good.

He is very nonchalant with affection, rarely gives genuine compliments, shows more reaction to negative things than positive ones, and makes little effort to make me feel desired or emotionally pursued. Sex feels empty and disconnected because there is no tenderness, warmth, or emotional engagement before or after, and despite me clearly explaining for years that I need words and actions to feel wanted, any change only happens briefly and then fades. I don’t feel seen, cherished, or desired, and over time that has eroded my attraction and left me feeling lonely inside my marriage. This isn’t something that hurts every day because I cope, stay busy, and appreciate our friendship, but the absence keeps resurfacing because it hasn’t truly been addressed, and I’m now questioning whether love and stability alone are enough if my emotional and physical needs continue to go unmet.

However, he really is a great person. He will change a strangers tire without asking, will make sure you have warm coffee in the am, will clean off 20 cars in the snow without complaint or anyone asking, will remember your order at a restaurant, and so much more. But he shows that to everyone. Not exclusive to me and I'm okay with that and love that about him.

I’m a 20 year old girl, and for the past two years I’ve been on a self improvement journey after failing out of college. I went to a party school, completely neglected my academics, and was dismissed. I moved back home, started working full time, and earned my associate’s degree from my local community college in two semesters. I’m now enrolled in a traditional four year college fully online (3.89 gpa) while working full time with special needs kids, a job that aligns with my career goals.

I’m proud of myself for fixing my academics, but I’ve realized that school and work are the only things I’ve been prioritizing. My schedule has been so full for the past year and a half that I’m exhausted every day, and everything else in my life has been neglected.

I cut off friends who were not good influences, and now I only really have one friend, who lives about an hour away. Aside from coworkers who are not my age, I don’t have people to grab coffee with or do normal 20 year old things with. I feel lonely and disconnected from people my age. And since my school is fully online, I don’t meet anyone through classes or campus.

I’ve also gained around 20 pounds, most of it during college, and my diet has gotten worse since then. I rely on fast food because my lunch breaks are short and it's cheap and easy, and I feel uncomfortable in my body. It’s clearly not healthy weight gain, and it’s affecting my confidence.

I feel stuck because I don’t know how to fix these other parts of my life. I can’t afford to move out of my parents’ house (I’m 20 and live in New York suburbs). The only exercise I genuinely enjoy is running, which I did consistently for a few months, but now it’s freezing. I’ve thought about joining a gym, but I know myself and I wouldn’t go unless it was a scheduled commitment. I’m not trying to make excuses, just giving context. If the answer is “get up and run,” I will but I just want to be realistic.

I also don’t know how to make friends when I feel like I’m starting from zero. I’m scared that I’m wasting my youth, and I worry that if I start prioritizing other parts of my life like I used to, my grades will suffer and all my work will have been for nothing! The thought that my 21st birthday will be me sitting alone at home makes me incredibly sad, especially when my 18th was spent surrounded by friends on a trip they planned for me. 18 year old me would make fun of 20 year old me.

1psoiwk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1psoiwk,"Request: Help me rearrange the Master Suite's WIC, Washer and Dryer, Wet Room, and Sauna Please","Request Context:
We are in the process of remodeling our entire home. The rest of the house design sparks joy. I am really struggling with the Master Bedroom's supporting spaces (WIC, Wet Room, Laundry, Sauna).
I have attached two images:
 * The proposed layout for the Master Bath/Closet area (highlighted area is the fixed footprint).
 * The full floor plan for context.

Our Constraints and Must Haves:
 * Footprint: The highlighted blue boundary in the cropped image is fixed. We cannot expand the room, but we can move internal walls/plumbing within that box.
 * Ceilings: 10' high throughout.
 * We like the single door from the bedroom to access the closet and bathroom and are happy with the walk through the walk in closet to the bathroom. I understand this is a polarizing issue, we've considered the question. 
 * Sauna: Must have a bench approx. 6' or longer (24” depth). Currently, access is designed through the shower (wet room style), which we like but are open to feedback on.
 * Laundry: Stacked Washer/Dryer must be located in the closet or immediately adjacent. We have taken into account  ventilation for heat, lint and moisture. 
 * Tub/Shower: We want a 66"" or 72"" standalone tub and a roomy shower.
 * Storage: We need a dedicated linen closet.
 * Vanity: We are happy with a single sink if it means better flow elsewhere.

We are unsure about:
 * The ""Vibe"": It feels functional but clunky. It doesn't feel amazing or luxurious like the rest of the house.
 * Linen Closet: I really dislike the current location (with the toilet tucked behind). It creates a narrow tunnel for the toilet and feels like an afterthought.
 * Shower Bench: The current plan lacks a proper built-in bench.
 * WIC Flow: The closet feels a bit chopped up by the W/D placement.

My Question:
Does anyone see a Tetris solution here that we are missing? How would you rearrange these elements to make the space feel more open and logical while keeping all our requirements?
Thanks in advance!

**The concept:** Help people find cafes by specific needs (quiet for work, has outlets, good for dates) using community tags and real-time intel.

**Tech stack:**

\- Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS

\- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)

\- Cloudinary for image uploads

\- Browser Geolocation API

\- PWA with service workers

**Technical questions:**

1. **Geolocation approach**: Currently using browser geolocation + Haversine formula for distance calculations within 25-mile radius. Better approaches? How do you handle users who deny location permissions?

2. **Multi-city scaling:** Started Houston-only. Planning expansion. Should I:

   \- Separate databases per city?

   \- Single database with city filters?

   \- Microservices approach with city-specific services?

3. **PWA vs Native in 2026:** Is PWA still the right call for location-based apps? Lower friction but limited features. Worth the tradeoff?

4. **Image optimization:** Using Cloudinary free tier, limiting 3 photos per check-in. At scale, what's the better approach?

5. **Cold-start problem:** For location-based social apps, how do you bootstrap initial content? Seed it yourself or wait for organic growth?

**Current challenge:** Built this solo with no code review. Would appreciate technical critique on approach.

It's not random—we've actually become weirdly close over the last month, I started talking to him out of curiosity (he was looking like a student) and he was just so nice and open. He's quiet, super artistic (sewing,drawing,street art...), has immaculate taste in music, and also loves nature and adventures. 

We've had this crazy connection: read the same book at the same time without planning it, made each other playlists, spent hours talking during lunch break (on a bench by a lake!!) about life, art, and our families. We had really deep talks that were amazing and I love his way of thinking. I also decided to gift him a book (The Alchemist) for Christmas and he was super gratefull for it.

The problem? He’s a massive introvert. Loves his solitude, takes forever to text back, and at some point told me he prefers to eat lunch alone to read... so now we're not eating together anymore. He continue to come up to me to talk everytime we cross path in the buildings tho. He did told me that he wasn't used to being around a lot of people anymore and he needed a moment to read to relax. I felt like I might have overwhelmed him a bit too much. I also know that he's seeing a psychologist but don't know for wich reasons exactly. 

So his contract ends in the middle of january cause he's just replacing someone. I don't want to just let this fade into a ""what if."" I want to be brave and clear, but in a way that doesn’t freak him out. I need to somehow show him I'm romantically interested.

I'm thinking of:

· Bringing him coffee in a thermos one morning (since he starts very early in the morning). Or other small gestures like that to show him I care ? Or is it too much ?

· Asking him to do one specific thing with me outside of school, like checking out an art gallery

· Just being more obvious with my vibe, don't know how to do so tho???

##🪵 Episode introduction by the Log Lady

>Pie. Whoever invented the pie? Here was a great person. In Twin Peaks, we specialize in cherry pie and huckleberry pie. We do have many other types of pie, and at the Double R Diner, Norma knows how to make them all better than anyone I have ever known. I hope Norma likes me. I know I like her and respect her. I have spit my pitch gum out of my mouth onto her walls and floors and sometimes onto her booths. Sometimes I get angry and do things I'm not proud of. I do love Norma's pies. I love pie with coffee.

##🚨 Warnings from the Future

Be wary, travelers! In Twin Peaks, even the numbers can be...slippery. Some sources label the Pilot as Episode 0, while others count it as Episode 1. To stay on track, follow the episode titles, not just the numbers. Write it in your diary.

If you've just arrived in Twin Peaks, you should know the original U.S. pilot (1 hour 34 minutes) is the true beginning. It opens the door slowly, letting the fog roll in and the mysteries breathe. The so-called ""International Release"" (1 hour 52 minutes) tacks on an ending that concludes the case far too soon, unraveling secrets meant to linger in shadow.

##📢 Reminders from the Past

**🚫 No piracy.** Don't share or request links to pirated content. The FBI will notice.

**🚫 No spoilers.** If you must speak of things yet to come, wrap them in spoiler markup like so: \>!James was always cool.!<

**🚫 No brawling.** Be respectful of other travelers, and remember the best thing to do sometimes is simply nod and sip your coffee.

Had tacos, coffee, water, and nerds gummies (my favorite candy). I planned to end my fast at 6pm. But my husband and I had snacks later that night. So I finished everything by 8PM. 

17 hour fast 

Day 14 was my family's Christmas Party. The party was awesome. Seeing everyone, having a good time, and catching up on life. I broke my fast around 1:30 PM. Ate a bunch of food. Pickles, meat, meatballs, coffee, potatos, veggies, and chocolate. I drank coffee, water, alcohol and pop. I finished eating by 6PM

17 hour fast 

Day 15 Was a lazy Sunday. I laid in bed till 11AM. Got out of bed. Had summer sausage and hot chocolate for breakfast. Watched Dragon Ball. Made food for the week. Slow cooked chicken and veggies. Had Thai for lunch (spring rolls and shrimp rolls with plum sauce) plum sauce is so good with both spring rolls and shrimp rolls. Slept for a few hours. Had some hot chocolate. And finished eating everything by 7PM.

My last visit dito is June 2025 and the underrated food stop/carinderia for me is nasa tapat ng PS Bank/Poblacion District Central. Maliit siya na carinderia pero always sold out ang food. What I love about their food sobrang sulit ang price, malaki ang rice servings, may free sabaw at favorite ko ang fried rice nila. Mabilis maubos pero worth it ang lasa. 

At ang overrated na food stop for me is green coffee. Parang maraming nag endorse na mga students or folks about sa lasa ng coffee but it's plain. Saka the place is good but not that attracting.

Started with Houston only to test before expanding.

Technical questions for the community:

1.Cold-start problem: How do you get initial content for location-based social platforms? Seed it yourself or wait for organic?

2. Multi-city architecture: Planning to expand - should I structure this as separate databases per city or one unified database with city filters?

3. PWA vs native: Is PWA still the right choice in 2025 for this type of app?

4. Geolocation: Using browser geolocation + Haversine for distance. Better approaches?

Built this solo, no code review, so would love technical critique on the approach.

I attend a 12 step program and my group decides to have a Xmas-bday party this last Friday, this because there are 6 birthdays this month, mine next week. I am closing an online store and I have all sorts of cool thing I can gift. I chose 8 gifts, among them one cool speaker, a Nintendo coffee mug, high end candles, several nice shoulder bags, things that are brand new and I am no longer selling.  I Arrived to the party and gave the hostess a gift card for Whole Foods , had some food and everything seem to be fine. Until a new member, an older man bought in his karaoke machine. We were chatting and a some point I realized we were all shouting because the music he was playing was extremely loud. Here I want to add that I don’t tolerate loud noises,  I can’t help it, it drives me nuts. That music sounds ethnic of his country and he’s the only one from there. The hostess asked him to lower the volume of the music. This same thing happened twice. After a bit, I set my presents all wrapped in a table and told them that I got gifts to play white elephant. We started and a girl got the first gift and suddenly this man started playing a waltz and invite a young woman to dance. And here I am, trying to coordinate a white elephant game with gifts I bought, and this individual plays music and starts a dance, interrupting the game. I felt unappreciated, I felt that my gesture was not being taken seriously and honestly, I just can’t fake a smile. I stood up, took my things and left. I started getting calls and messages asking where did I go and if I was coming back. I’m still hurt and I don’t want to talk to any of them. Today I’m a little more calm and I am not so sure what I was supposed to do. AITA for leaving when I felt I was being ignored? ",7,1766371321.0,AITAH,12,0.82,False

My ex wife profile showed up. And on guy in the group speaks up and says she is a “mega hoe”. That she would give it up if he buys her some coffee. That the last time they had sex was almost a year ago. But they been talk and sleeping with each other for the last 3-4 years. Started when we were together and when I thought we were good. She would pillow talk to him about all of our problems. Bring him to my house when I was at work or take my kids with her to go meet him.

1pso9qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1pso9qf/cobenfy/,Cobenfy,"I started Cobenfy about two weeks ago. For me, the appeal was that it doesn't make you gain weight like Invega. With Inevga, I gained 50 lbs in two years,  had breast leakage at times, and constipation. Also I don't know what this means to anyone else, but I only got a period about 3-4 times a year. Oh, and my acne came back. 
With Cobenfy, my cravings have stopped and I've been gradually been losing weight, so I'm very happy about that. I will say, Cobenfy gives me worse constipation, so I started eating a very nutritious diet with lots of fiber. Coffee helps too.  Like Invega, I still take stool softeners at night. The only side effect I really don't like is the intense dreams that are insanely realistic, I can't tell them apart from reality. Before, my dreams were really surreal and a bit spotty, so as I woke up, they would just naturally fade away pretty quickly unless I wrote them down. Conbenfy is not like that. However, after the first night, my dreams returned to being what I was used to at night, but if I took my meds early in the morning and went back to sleep, they went right back to being grossly real. 
So, that's my take on Cobenfy.It came out in 2024, so yes, it's really new. I've tried Latuda, Olonzopine, and Invega and none were right for me! Latuda made me so brain dead I couldn't understand my old college essays! Olonzopine also made me gain tons of weight. Other than the intense dreams, I'm liking this drug.",1,1766371156.0,schizophrenia,0,1.0,False

This event is really, really mundane, but while I was chanting something clicked in my mind. I had reached for my coffee cup while looking at my monitor and working. I could kind of see it in my peripheral vision, and my brain KNEW exactly where it was. My hand went exactly where I thought the coffee cup was, but didn't make contact with anything.

It sounds weird, but it was like a shock to the system and for a few moments the illusory and empty dream like nature of reality actually felt internalized and experienced rather than just something I know intellectually. This feeling subsided soon after, but it felt like a nice little glimpse behind the curtain that was gifted from Amida.

I've been on and off practicing Mahayana for years with different teachers, but this is the first time I've had a ""oh THATS what they're talking about"" type moment.
