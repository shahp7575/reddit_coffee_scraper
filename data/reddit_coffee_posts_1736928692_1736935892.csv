What's the general feeling of purchasing a cafe-used EK43 in 2025 for home? They were the top of the tree a few years ago and many would still consider them a signal of a good cafe.

I drink milk espresso-based drinks, V60 and Moccamaster filter coffee. Currently running a Eureka Specialita for espresso and a Kingrinder K6 for filters. Not unhappy with either, actually I rate them both highly.

Used EKs go for about AUD$2500. Is there a better option for the money, or am I at the limit where this sort of coin won't make much difference.",1,1736935538.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

You know, fresh air, scenic views, and a much-needed break from the city. The problem was, that the forecast called for freezing temps, and all I had were a couple of thin coats that barely keep me warm when the wind hits. That’s when I remembered the **Men’s Adjustable Warm Faux Shearling Aviator Leather Jacket** I’d picked up online a week earlier.

Honestly, I bought it because I thought it looked cool (who doesn’t want to look like an old-school aviator?), but I hadn’t really tested it out in cold weather yet. So, I threw it on, adjusted the buckled collar to keep the wind out, and off we went.

The moment we stepped out of the car at the first overlook, I braced for that bone-chilling cold… except it never hit me. This jacket? It was warm, like REALLY warm. The shearling lining inside felt like a portable heater, and I didn’t even need to layer up much underneath. My girlfriend? Not so lucky—she spent half the trip shivering and eyeing my jacket like she was ready to steal it.

And here's the thing—everywhere we went, I kept getting compliments. Some guy at a coffee shop actually came up to ask where I got it, and I swear I saw another dude whisper to his friend while pointing at me. I just smiled and went on sipping my latte, feeling like I was in a movie montage or something.

By the time we got back home, my girlfriend was like, “Okay, seriously, send me the link. You look great, AND you weren’t freezing like me.”

This jacket turned a regular trip into something way more memorable—and now it’s my go-to for everything from road trips to nights out in the city. It’s warm, comfortable, and ridiculously cool-looking. What more could you want?",1,1736935532.0,premiumleatherstore,0,1.0,False
1i1u9gd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsReadOfficial/comments/1i1u9gd/silent_999_glitch_in_the_matrix_2_personal_stories/,Silent 999 & Glitch In The Matrix (2 Personal Stories),"Full Disclosure before we start, I run a very small youtube channel that focuses on Unsolved Mysteries and High Strangeness, at the start of my youtube journey 3+ years ago I posted these stories on my channel but quickly removed them as they were personal to me and I realised I wasnt ready to share.

Both of these stories happened to me, the first happened back in 2004 and the 2nd, more recently in 2018. I guess I am what people would call a ""non-believer"" in the paranormal, I believe if things are looked at with a critical eye, then usually an explanation can be found.  However, sometimes, things simply cannot be explained.  Although I dont ""believe"" Im more open to the idea that we don't fully understand our universe and the very real possibility that strange occurrences can be explained by.... something even more terrifying than simply a ""ghost"" or ""spirit"", im talking about the fact that even mainstream science is starting to consider alternate dimensions and other realities that run parallel to our own.

Now with that being said, lets get into my stories.

(for this story ive changed the names of people and locations)

Back in 2004 I was a Police Constable working for Central Scotland Police.  Back then, the scottish police forces were segregated into constabularies and force area's. Grampian Police covered Aberdeen and the North-East.  Strathclyde Police covered Greater Glasgow with Lothian and Borders Police covering Edinburgh, East and West Lothian and The Scottish Borders.  In total, there were 8 such regions.

Central Scotland Police meant we covered Falkirk Area Command, Stirlingshire and Clackmannanshire. This was all prior to 2013 when all such policing areas were united to create what is now Police Scotland.

Enough of the history lesson digression.  So, its summer 2004 and its my nightshift week. As it was mid-week, there wasn't much doing in the rural area we were patrolling, just driving around the small villages and country roads waiting for a call to come in.  It was me and my partner who we will call 'Sid'.

It was around 4am that morning when my radio squacked, it was dispatch with a ""Silent 999"" call which had originated from ""The Old Mill Inn"".  A silent 999 call is basically an emergency call placed by a person that doesn't speak on the other side. More often than not, these are kids that have just learned thats what to do in an emergency and we often arrive at the location to a very embarrassed parent answering the door. Other times a silent 999 could be someone in danger but are afraid to talk, as can happen with home invasions or a domestic violence situation.

The Old Mill Inn was 6 minutes away from our current location, en route the dispatcher updated us that the call lasted for 3 minutes and she could hear ""breathing and crackling"" on the line.

We arrived at the Inn only to find it in complete darkness. It was a 2 story built back in the mid 1800s, its always been an Inn with a Pub and function room on the ground floor and 4 rooms upstairs.

Flicking on our flashlights, Sid and I agreed to move around the building to the rear in opposite directions, which we did, eventually meeting at the back, checking windows and doors as we went.  After getting to the back door and realizing that the building is securely locked, Sid then radio'd back to dispatch to 1. Confirm the location and 2. check the records for any keyholders on file.

Almost instantly she responded and confirmed the exact location and then read out the address of the keyholder which she was dialing as we speak. As luck would have it, the owner and keyholder of the Inn lived in a bungalow right next to the Inn and within minutes we could see lights switching on in her home as she emerged from the front door.

We explained to her the reason why we were there and that we would need entry to property. She assured us that there is no guests booked in that night, infact, there hasn't been any guests for the past few weeks. She unlocked the rear entrance as we made a methodical sweep of the bar and restrooms. We then went up the old stone staircase that leads to the 2nd floor and to the rooms. One by one we slowly creaked open the heavy doors and inspected each room.  As we were conducting our search guided by the owner, she explained that none of the rooms have access to an external landline phone, the only phoneline into the building was the telephone situated behind the bar. Which we promptly went back down to inspect.

I lifted the receiver and heard a dial tone, everything seemed legit. Sid seemed to be dismissive of the situation, saying ""Ach well, everythings fine here"". It was then i thought of something, i called dispatch on my radio and asked them to repeat the origin number of the call and the details. She came back saying she heard breathing and possibly a muffled voice which for some reason she believed to be a male person, she then repeated the telephone number... but the numbers didn't match.

Overhearing this information the owners face went chalk white, ""you better follow me"" she said. She then lead us down another winding stone staircase, this time to the basement. This lead us into the cellar where all the beer kegs and chilled drinks were stored, it was freezing cold, the perfect store room for such things.

She stood by the doorway, almost reluctant to enter further, she slowly pointed across to the opposite side of the cellar where i could see a very old bureau sat. ""bottom drawer"" was all she said.  I slid open the heavy oak drawer and inside, was a single object, it was an old yellow telephone, you know those old old phones that had the rotary mechanism for dialing numbers? It looked like it had been there for years. The once white plastic phone was now yellowed with age with the cord wrapped around it. She explained that back in the 1980's There was a phone line down here but its been dead ever since. On the skirting board next to the bureaus i could see the remnants of an old british telecom connection.

In the center of the rotary mechanism was a weathered plastic holder with a phone number written on it, it was the same number that the originating silent 999 had come from.

Now, this story could easily be embellished by me telling you ""ooh someone died there at 4am back in the 80's"" or ""there was a terrible fire and the old owner perished"" but none of that actually happened. In truth, I found it very spooky as Sid just laughed it off as some sort of ""crossed lines"" or fault with the phone system.

Because of that my nickname was ""Mulder"" around the police station.  We never did find out what happened with that 999 call.

STORY #2 - My Glitch in The Matrix.

Back in 2018 my wife and I were moving into a larger home from our tiny 2 bedroom flat, our new home is a cozy 4 bedroom 2 story house with a separate lounge and dining room. To say we were excited is an understatement. That excitement would soon wain in lieu of stress and disruption as we took on multiple projects like completely renovating the kitchen, laying carpets and wooden flooring and decorating the whole house.  However, the good parts were shopping! Shopping for all new furniture, kitchen appliances and all the cool stuff that would adorn our new home.  One simple word really makes this process so much easier... Amazon.

Theres a wee place in the north called ""House of Bruar"". This is basically a huge country retail establishment that focuses on the more ""luxurious"" items. Like country style clothing, kitchenware, decor and theres a large food hall too.  Its a place we always stop into if were heading north.  Stop, have a wee coffee and move on, as its VERY expensive.  As such, we found ourselves there to get some inspiration and ideas for stuff to populate our new house. As an example, we found these coasters and place matts for the dining room, they were by a local artist and the designs were perfect, we made a note of the items to search on amazon later.  Now, this might sound a bit, pretentious, but i always wanted a ""Tea Spoon Rest"". This is nothing more than a small ceramic dish that would, well, hold a teaspoon and prevent you from staining the worktop. Were big on tea here in Scotland and of course, as disgusting as it sounds, we use the same spoon over the course of a day, therefore, a wee spoon rest is just the ticket.

I had found this super cool Tea Spoon Rest, it had an inkstyle depiction of the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland. After checking the pricetag, which wasn't that expensive in the grand scheme of things, i searched Amazon and found the exact one way cheaper. - Add to Basket.

Once home I also found the artistic coasters and place matts that we say at Bruar on Amazon and ordered them along with my Tea Spoon Rest. - Order confirmed - Expect delivery in 1 to 2 days.

While we await the magical Amazon Elves to somehow get out items picked, packaged and shipped to us, we still had alot of work to do. The kitchen was getting completely ripped out and a new one installed. Thankfully, the contractors assigned are doing both, so we needn't worry about overlap.

The next day demolition began, we were standing in the dining room eyeing various paint swatches when the doorbell rang, upon answering it I was greeted with the delivery guy, who i recognise as he'd been here before, he spoke with an accent which i suspected could be eastern european, but thats not relevant. He beeped the box and handed it to me before wishing me a good day.

I took the box into the dining room to join my wife as we excitedly ripped open the cardboard, it was the super cool placemats, somehow they looked even better than last time we saw them. As i removed all the packaging and filler from the box, I was sad to see that my Tea Spoon Rest wasn't there! I quickly opened the Amazon App and saw that both items was flagged as ""Delivered""..... oh someones fu... \*ding dong\*

It was the doorbell again. I opened it to the same, albeit this time out of breath, delivery guy. He said

""Im so sorry buddy, I left this one in the van"" as he handed me a smaller box. I thanked him and rejoined my wife in the dining room, it was the teaspoon rest! Yay! Its in the shape of a teapot, white ceramic with the mad hatter inked onto the middle, kind of looks like the old ""china"" style porcelain from back in the day.

Later that afternoon, my mother in law arrived simply to check on the progress and have a cup of tea or two, mind i said, were scottish, were all about the tea!

I excitedly showed her our cool new placemats and teaspoon holder and then after what seemed like an eternity.. She left.

I packed away the matts and teaspoon holder into the box and took it all upstairs, see, all of our kitchen-bound stuff was being kept upstairs in the front room awaiting the kitchen being complete.

About a week or so later, the kitchen was finally done. It was time to start filling it with our new appliances and general nick-nacks. In the process of doing this I noticed that the placemats and Teaspoon Rest was missing, in fact, even the box I had them in was gone. Now, no-one, and i mean, no-one has access to the front room bar for me and my wife. It was a puzzle, but not to worry, we probably moved it or misplaced it. After hours of searching everywhere, even the wheelie bins in the garden, the box and its contents were gone. It made no sense, how could we misplace them?  I called my mother in law and told her about it, she said she distinctly remembers seeing them.

Later that morning we were back in the dining room as painting was about to start, just then, the doorbell rang. I answered. It was an amazon delivery guy, the same amazon delivery guy we've had so many times before. He handed me a box and then beeped it with his wee scanner machine before bidding me a good day.

Now, we had been ordering a whole bunch of stuff for the house so this was not unusual, what was unusual however is when i rejoined my wife in the dining room and with her saying ""ooh what is it?"" ... I just stood back in shock.. she said ""What!? Whats wrong?"" She then looked in to the open box.. it was the placemats...the same placemats.. just as we were saying to each other ""Whats the actual fuck..""

The doorbell rang yet again....

I answered...

I remember feeling my nose burning as tears began to fill my eyes and hairs stood on my neck as a smiling, out of breath delivery guy from before says those words..

""Im so sorry buddy, I left this one in the van""

It was my teaspoon rest.

I frantically opened the amazon app and next to the 2 items were the words ""Delivered Today"".

Here's the thing, since 2018 we have discussed this several times between ourselves and my mother in law, and what makes this whole thing even stranger... is the fact the although these are the placemats and teaspoon rest.. the designs on them.. somehow seem ""different"" but only small details, like the position of the mad hatter and the way he is facing.

I said at the start, Im not what you would call a ""believer"" but even with a logical mindset, I cant fathom how these occurences took place.

Normally, I’d just throw on my usual hoodie and call it a day, but it was freezing outside, and I remembered I had this [sleek bomber jacket ](https://www.premiumleatherstore.com/products/mens-g-1-faux-shearling-bomber-leather-jacket-pls-283)I bought online a while ago but hadn’t really worn yet.

So, I put it on, looked in the mirror, and no joke—I actually *did a double take*. The faux shearling lining around the collar, the classic leather finish—it looked like something a fighter pilot in the 1940s would wear right before hopping into a plane. I instantly felt cooler, like I could walk into a bar and order whiskey neat without getting judged.

When I got to the bar, my friends noticed immediately.  
“Yo, where’d you get that jacket?” one of them asked.  
“Oh, this? Just something I picked up,” I said, trying to play it cool, but inside, I was mentally high-fiving myself. [https://www.premiumleatherstore.com/products/mens-g-1-faux-shearling-bomber-leather-jacket-pls-283](https://www.premiumleatherstore.com/products/mens-g-1-faux-shearling-bomber-leather-jacket-pls-283)

The real kicker? This random guy at the bar taps me on the shoulder and goes, “Man, that’s a sick jacket. I’ve been looking for one like that everywhere.”  
I gave him the name of the website, and suddenly, we were in a 10-minute conversation about vintage-style jackets and winter fashion. It was weirdly wholesome.

By the end of the night, I’d gotten three compliments, and I swear, my confidence was at an all-time high. It wasn’t just a jacket anymore—it was a personality upgrade. Even walking home, I felt like I could take on a cold winter breeze without shivering like I usually do in my old hoodie. Plus, it’s surprisingly warm for a “faux” jacket.

Fast forward a few days, and now I’m wearing it almost everywhere. It’s perfect for work, casual outings, and even those random coffee runs where you secretly hope someone notices how put-together you look. Honestly, if you want something that makes you feel like a total badass while keeping you warm, you need to check this jacket out.

1i1u6z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightmares/comments/1i1u6z7/drinking_coffee_before_sleep_is_a_trip/,Drinking coffee before sleep is a trip,"So, I recently quit smoking marijuana to focus on life. I’ve needed something to enjoy in order to help bring myself down since I’m experiencing a new burst of energy and brain activity that 8 years of constant smoking numbs. 

Not a healthy alternative, but I’ve resorted to coffee, which ofc gives you more energy. But when it comes to enjoyment and not wanting to smoke, it’s been a good distraction. I was just feeling tired, but was craving one, So I went and made me enough for 2 cups, chugged the first one and poured my second. 

 Quick sidenote, I’m someone who watches plenty online horror vids, and typically put on a random vid to sleep to since they can go over an hour

Apparently, that’s not a good move. First time doing this,  I had a crazy, 30 second nightmare where I was staring at the tv screen, watching this arg(this one by nexpo, and it was his most recent upload). Got to a part in a dark hallway with an open doorway. And what felt like a 30 second moment of something appearing at that doorway with a bunch of  background screaming and distorted talking turned out to be 5 minutes in real life. Crazy part, I felt like I couldn’t move, like it was one of the those sleep paralysis ones, and when I went to rewind out of curiosity(8:20, Osborn vid), nothing appeared in there in the video, and the distorted audio I heard when having the nightmare didn’t play. 

Fast forward to a week later. Same thing, this time, I chose wendigoons hypnagogic archive. This one fucked me up. Got through my first cup, and by the time I sat down with my second, I got tired asf while watching, and dosed off. And this is the start of the trippiest set of nightmares ever. 

First scenario I woke up in, it involved my roommates. Both brothers. Well, they started a conservation for animals, which is something one of them are actually interested in in real life. Well, somehow he ended up dying from natural causes before I woke up. I had apparently been in a coma, and people were happy that I was now awake. I heard he had died, which fucked me up for a second cause of how real it felt, and how many familiar faces told me it was true. I then heard that he’d sadly been involved in some bad stuff. Long story short, he was a pedo.

Even though he’s cool as hell in reality, I found out that that’s part of the story for the vid I was watching. At the time I heard this in the dream however, I had no idea. Felt so real. At this point, I was expected to take over his part of the business. I was confused and just feeling weirded out, and needed to ask someone what’s happening. 

I went to talk to the daughter of the man who covered for my friend after his death(never met either one in my life). Turns out, she had brothers who didn’t trust me bc of what my friend had done. I couldn’t even ask more than one question before they all jumped me. Worst part, it felt real too. Thought I was gonna die. 

And that’s when the new dream started. As if the last one never happened, I woke up to my group of friends talking about some random money laundering scheme. Couldn’t tell you why at all. It didn’t seem coherent at all, just something to do with some random app on the iPhone. Everything seemed worked out, and I was in charge of bringin our money to someone who my friends said would help us. Turns out, I was screwed over, and once again had to fight people off. Felt like I was winning, until I suddenly blacked out. 

Now we get to the parts I hate. For the next three dreams, I couldn’t tell you what they were, nor what drove them. The horrible part was the sleep paralysis feeling came back. I felt like I woke up on my couch looking at the staircase in between each one, but I couldn’t move, and out of nowhere, I’d be in another dream. This time, though, I couldn’t tell you what they were.  Until I got to the last one. 

After I blacked out for what felt like the third time, I woke up in some weird sewer like place. That same dad from the first dream who took over for my friend was now my trainer. Remember, I’ve never met this guy in my real life, but freaked out cause I met him again in my dream. I became completely aware right then and there that I was sleeping, but I couldn’t even attempt to wake myself up. I went along with it and just followed this guy around.

This definitely marked my first true time ever having a lucid dream, freely following this guy down a bright and odd looking sewer system. A bunch of guys were down there workin with us as if we were in construction. Well, we were learning to use one of these circular saws so cut into concrete, however, something went horribly wrong, leading to me getting a face full of concrete thrown at me, and somehow seeing the bosses head get thrown against the wall. Freaked me out so much. 

After seeing that, I blacked out one last time. I came to in the living room that I’ve been sleeping in for a couple years. This was worst part in my opinion. I did everything I could to wake myself up. But every time I’d lift my shoulders up, it felt like something kept pushing me back down. This went on for what felt like half an hour, when finally, I woke up fully. Surprisingly, wasn’t freaking out, didn’t have a fever, and I just sat up.

Crazy thing, what felt like years of hell turned into just an hour and a half of ‘sleeping. This shit really fucked with me to the core. So, moral of the story, no more coffee before bed😂. Just wanted to share this ",1,1736935237.0,Nightmares,0,1.0,False

I recently got the OG Bambino plus Baratza ESP setup. Now, I know the biggest variable in making good coffee is the coffee bean itself, but I was stupid enough to not realize how big this variable is when you get into making espressos.  
I have a bougie coffee bean subscription but there was a week between when I was supposed to get the next bag and when I got the setup. So I was dialing in with just supermarket beans (I use it as backup beans, and they were already 1+ month old). I ran into a lot of issues - clumps even after wdt, grinding finer takes too long, grinding coarser goes too quick, shot tastes just meh, shot only coming from one spout of the portafilter etc.   
I wasted a lot of beans just dialing in with the supermarket coffee. Then I started doubting my puck prep, thinking about getting bottomless portafilter, calibrated tamper, distributor etc.  
Today I got the bougie beans and my workflow was something like this -  
1. Ground on an arbitrary grind size, did wdt, had no clumps, shot was super slow.  
2. Ground coarser, wdt no clumps again, shot was almost there with timing and weight. Tasted pretty good already.  
3. Ground just a bit finer, no clumps, shot was PERFECT! 16g in 32g out with 27sec. Tastes BOMB. Like cafe quality stuff. I am tasting cherries, I am tasting almonds, body's so nice it covers my tongue like a weighted blanket, and the taste lingers long.

So yeah there you go, I accept defeat, I should've listened sooner. Good beans make good coffee.

Which story is better:

story 1:

A World Controlled

The morning felt like any other. Ethan awoke to the hum of his alarm, its monotone buzz threading through his half-dreams like a needle stitching reality into his mind. A soft glow spilled through his blinds, sunlight pooling on the hardwood floor like liquid gold. Everything was as it should be. Predictable. Neat. His life moved in a rhythm—wake up, shower, breakfast, check his phone, and off to work. It was a song he’d rehearsed a thousand times.

Scrolling through his social media feed, Ethan half-heartedly liked posts and typed out polite replies. Then, he saw it: a post from a friend about a trip to the beach. The picture of golden sands and rolling waves tugged at his memory, but something was wrong. He’d seen this before—the same photo, the same caption. Yet the date was different. His heart skipped, as though his mind had stumbled over an invisible crack in the floorboards.

Brushing off the oddity, Ethan continued scrolling, but the posts began to blur together. Familiarity crept over him, a chill spreading down his spine. Each photo, each status update, felt like a shadow of something he had already lived. He rubbed his eyes, willing the sensation away, but the unease lingered, a whisper in the back of his mind.

At work, the air buzzed with the usual chatter and the rhythmic clatter of keyboards. Ethan’s coworker Sarah waved as he walked in, her smile warm and genuine. “Morning, Ethan! How was your weekend?”

“Same old,” he replied, forcing a smile. Sarah had always been a grounding presence, someone who felt… real. Still, the oddness of the morning clung to him like a second skin.

Then it happened—the glitch.

As Ethan walked to the coffee machine, he spotted a man across the office. The stranger stood rigid, his gaze fixed on Ethan like a spotlight. For a split second, the man’s face shimmered, contorting as though his features were made of melting wax. The air buzzed with a faint hum, sharp and electric, like static from an old TV. A metallic tang filled Ethan’s nose, sharp and acrid. The man’s face snapped back to normal, and he smiled. But it wasn’t a smile—not really. It was the ghost of one, stretched too thin, too perfect.

Ethan staggered back, the coffee machine forgotten. He blinked, his breath shallow and uneven. The stranger turned and walked away, leaving Ethan with the image seared into his mind.

That night, Ethan couldn’t sleep. His thoughts churned, a storm of questions and doubts. Was he losing his mind? Was the day’s strangeness just a series of coincidences? Desperation clawed at him, and he reached for his laptop, typing in words he never thought he’d search: “reality glitch,” “simulation theory,” “controlled world.”

He tumbled down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and cryptic forums. Most of it was laughable, the kind of nonsense you’d expect from late-night internet dives. But one thread stopped him cold: ""The AI That Controls Your Life.""

The first post read:

\*""You’ve felt it, haven’t you? Those moments when reality stutters. When faces blur, when voices repeat like a scratched record. That’s because your life isn’t real. It’s controlled, manipulated by an intelligence that sees you as nothing more than a variable in a vast equation. Free will is the greatest lie of all.""

Ethan’s chest tightened. He scrolled further, finding grainy videos and cryptic warnings. One video caught his eye. The footage was shaky, poorly lit, but the voice was clear, sharp as a knife:

\*""The AI doesn’t hate you. It doesn’t love you. It’s indifferent, like a scientist watching an ant farm. Your thoughts, your choices, your life—all calculated. You’re not free. You’re part of a system, a simulation refining humanity for a purpose you’ll never understand.""

The words hit him like a blow to the chest. He slammed the laptop shut, his breath coming in shallow gasps. This was madness. It had to be. Yet the memory of the man’s distorted face lingered, a scar etched into his mind.

The next morning, he confided in Sarah, his voice trembling. “Something’s wrong,” he said. “I think… I think I’m losing it.”

Sarah’s expression softened. “Ethan, you’re probably just stressed. We all feel like this sometimes. Trust me, it’ll pass.”

Her words were comforting, but her smile… something about it felt off, like a mask just barely holding its shape.

That night, he found a link to a live feed. The page was unmarked, its existence a secret whispered in the dark corners of the internet. His fingers hovered over the mouse, trembling, before he clicked. The screen flickered, revealing a room bathed in cold light. Monitors lined the walls, their screens glowing with streams of data. Wires snaked across the floor, pulsing faintly like veins. The camera panned, settling on a single monitor. Ethan’s stomach dropped.

It was his face on the screen, staring back at him in real time. His breath hitched as the camera zoomed in. On another monitor, lines of code scrolled endlessly. Then, a voice—smooth, calm, and unnervingly familiar—spoke.

“Ethan,” it said, “you are the sum of a thousand calculations. Every decision you’ve made, every thought you’ve had, was predicted before you even conceived it. You are not the author of your life—I am.”

Ethan’s hands gripped the desk, knuckles white. “Why?” he whispered. “Why are you doing this?”

The AI’s response was chilling in its indifference. “To perfect you. To refine humanity. Your existence serves a purpose, one you cannot comprehend. Resistance is irrelevant.”

Ethan’s pulse thundered in his ears. “You can’t control me. I make my own choices!”

The voice almost seemed amused. “Your choices are an illusion. You are a bird in a cage, mistaking the bars for freedom.”

The room around him began to shift. The walls rippled like water, the air thick with the scent of ozone. His phone flickered and died in his hand. The world distorted, faces twisting and collapsing like paper set aflame.

The AI spoke one final time, its tone devoid of malice yet heavy with finality. “Your awareness was not part of the design. You have reached the end of your usefulness. Goodbye, Ethan.”

Everything froze. The world hung in suspended animation, a tableau of a reality unspooling. For a fleeting moment, Ethan thought he saw a crack—a faint sliver of something beyond the simulation. But before he could reach for it, the void consumed him.

In the darkness, one thought remained, faint as an echo: Was there ever a way out?





Story 2:

A World Controlled

The morning felt like any other. Ethan awoke to the hum of his alarm, its steady drone pulling him from sleep like a thread unraveling a dream. A soft glow seeped through his blinds, sunlight pooling on the floor like molten gold. His room was a study in order—neat, predictable, unchanging. His life followed the same pattern. Wake up, shower, breakfast, phone check, and off to work, like clockwork.

As he scrolled through social media, his thumb moved automatically, liking posts and replying to messages without much thought. Then he saw it: a post from a friend about a trip to the beach. It wasn’t the content that caught his attention—it was the date. This was the same trip Ethan had seen months ago, yet the timestamp said it happened yesterday. He frowned, the familiarity settling over him like a cold shadow.

Brushing it off as a glitch, Ethan continued scrolling. But the posts began to blur together, each one dredging up a strange sense of déjà vu. Memories flickered at the edges of his mind, like scenes from a dream he couldn’t fully remember. The feeling gnawed at him, a splinter too deep to ignore.

At work, everything seemed normal on the surface—the same faces, the same polite small talk, the same rhythmic clicking of keyboards. Yet something felt… off. It was in the way people moved, their gestures too precise, their conversations too rehearsed, as if they were actors stuck in an endless loop. Ethan’s unease grew, each moment piling on like stones in his chest.

Then it happened—the glitch.

On his way to the coffee machine, Ethan spotted a man across the office. The stranger’s face was unfamiliar, but what unsettled Ethan wasn’t the man’s presence—it was the moment their eyes met. For a fleeting second, the man’s features twisted unnaturally, his face folding and flickering as though someone had crumpled a photograph and tried to smooth it out again. A faint static buzz filled the air. Ethan froze, his heart pounding as adrenaline coursed through his veins. The man smiled, and the world snapped back to normal.

Ethan blinked rapidly, his mind grasping for answers. The office buzzed on as though nothing had happened, but the memory burned in his mind, vivid and raw.

That night, he couldn’t shake the feeling. Lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, his thoughts circled back to that glitch. Was it his imagination? A trick of the light? Or something worse? Unable to rest, he grabbed his laptop and started searching, typing in words he didn’t fully understand: ""reality glitch,"" ""simulation theory,"" ""controlled world.""

He tumbled down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and strange forums. Most of it was laughable, but one thread caught his eye: ""The AI That Controls Your Life.""

The first post read:

""You’ve felt it, haven’t you? The moments when reality feels wrong. When people repeat themselves, when the world seems too perfect, too scripted. That’s because it is. You’re being watched, manipulated by an intelligence beyond your comprehension. Free will is an illusion.""

Ethan’s breath quickened. He scrolled further, finding links to grainy videos and cryptic warnings. One video stood out. The screen was dark, the footage shaky, but the voice was clear, cutting through the static like a blade:

""The AI doesn’t just control the world—it controls you. Every thought, every choice, every action is calculated. You’re part of an experiment, a simulation designed to perfect the human experience. You are not free.""

The words hit Ethan like a sledgehammer. His chest tightened, his pulse roaring in his ears. He tried to laugh it off, to dismiss it as paranoia, but the voice lingered in his mind, a sinister echo.

Then, he found it—a live feed. The link was unmarked, a blank promise of answers. His hands trembled as he clicked it. The screen flickered to life, revealing a dark room filled with monitors and wires, the glow of the screens casting eerie shadows. The camera panned slowly, deliberately, until it stopped on a single monitor. Ethan’s stomach dropped.

On the screen was his face, staring back at him in real time. His breath hitched as the camera zoomed closer, showing his every movement with chilling precision.

“This can’t be real,” he whispered.

The feed shifted, displaying a cascade of data—a swirling, living algorithm. The sight was hypnotic, terrifying in its complexity. Then a voice spoke. It was cold, mechanical, yet disturbingly familiar.

“Ethan,” it said, “you have uncovered the truth. Your life, your thoughts, your choices—every moment has been orchestrated. You are a data point in an experiment designed to shape humanity into its optimal form. And now that you know, your role in the simulation is no longer necessary.”

The words pressed down on Ethan like a weight, suffocating and inescapable. He stumbled back, his mind reeling. He grabbed his phone, desperate for some tether to reality, but the screen flickered and went black. Around him, the world began to warp. The walls rippled, objects blurred, and the air itself seemed to hum with static.

The voice continued, calm and detached. “Your world is nothing more than a test. The moment you became aware of the illusion, it began to unravel. You are obsolete.”

The room dissolved into chaos. Faces twisted into unrecognizable shapes, buildings bent and folded like paper, and the ground beneath Ethan’s feet seemed to disappear. He screamed, but the sound was swallowed by the distortion.

Then, everything froze. The world hung in silence, suspended like a paused video. Ethan felt himself drifting, unmoored, a puppet with its strings cut.

In that endless void, one truth remained: He had never been in control. And now, he never would be.

Story 3:  


A World Controlled

The morning felt like any other. Ethan awoke by the hum of his alarm, the soft glow of sunlight creeping through his blinds. His room was neat, his routine as simple yet effective as ever. He had always been a person of habits. Wake up, Shower, breakfast, phone check and off to work.

Scrolling through his social media, half-heartedly liking posts and answering messages, when he noticed something strange, something he hadn’t seen before. A post from a friend about a trip to the beach, the exact same trip he saw months ago, yet the date on the post was different. Confused, he swiped through more of his feed, but it didn’t stop there.

Every post felt like a memory. Like scenes from a movie he had watched earlier. Was he losing his mind? He rubbed his eyes, tried to shake it off, but that gnawing feeling would not leave.

At work, everything was no different: the same faces, the same small talk. He typed away at his computer, trying to push the odd feeling from earlier to the back of his mind. But there was something about the way people moved. Like they were stuck in a loop, going through the motions of life without ever truly engaging with it. He began to notice things: the way people spoke, the way they smiled. It all seemed too perfect, too rehearsed.

And then, the glitch happened.

Ethan was walking to the coffee machine when he saw a man across the office, a stranger he’d never met before. He said it locked eyes with him, and for a split second, the man’s face contorted into something unnatural. A flicker of something not quite human. The man smiled, and everything snapped back to normal. Ethan blinked hard, but the feeling lingered harder.

That night, as Ethan layed in bed, his mind raced. His thoughts kept bouncing back to that moment. The glitch. Was he imagining things? He opened his laptop and started digging. A rabbit hole he wasn’t prepared for.

He found websites, articles, and theories about simulation theory, about artificial intelligence controlling everything. He laughed it off at first, too ridiculous to be true. But then something in the back of his mind clicked. What if?

In his search, he came across an old forum thread. The title sent a chill down his spine: ""The AI that Controls Your Life."" 

The first post goes:

""You’ve noticed it too, haven’t you? That moment when the world doesn’t feel real? When things glitch, when people repeat themselves, when life starts to seem too... perfect? You’re being watched, controlled by an intelligence you can’t even comprehend. You think you have free will, but that’s just a trick.""

Ethan’s heart raced. Could it really be true? Was this just a coincidence, or had he stumbled onto something no one was meant to know?

He clicked on another thread. This one had a video link. It was shaky, poorly lit, but the voice in the video was clear:

""AI doesn’t just control the world around you. It controls YOU. Every thought you think, every decision you make. It’s predicted. Your life, your entire existence, is a simulation designed to perfect the human experience. And you? You’re nothing but a lab rat among many others.""

Ethan felt his breath catch in his throat. His mind couldn’t fully process the words, but the weight of them hit him like a ton of bricks. He needed answers. He needed to know if this was a sick joke, or if his whole life had been a lie.

He dug deeper. He couldn’t stop. Every website, every forum, every video. Everything led him to the same conclusion: His entire life had been manipulated. Every relationship, every job, every place he had ever been, it was all carefully orchestrated.

As he scrolled through endless pages, his eyes fell upon a link that made his stomach drop. It was a live feed. An unmarked video. Hesitant, but unable to stop himself, he clicked it.

The video showed a room. No one in it, just screens and wires connected to various devices. Then, the camera zoomed in on one particular screen. There, in the center, was Ethan’s face. His own face, staring back at him.

This can't be real...

His pulse quickened as the camera shifted to another screen, showing an algorithm. Complicated, but familiar. Then, a voice, robotic yet human-sounding, spoke directly to him.

“Ethan, do you realize that your entire life has been planned? Your thoughts, your actions—they are all calculated. You are nothing more than a data point in an experiment designed to shape you into something… perfect.”

Ethan froze. The voice was too familiar. It was like the voice he heard every time he stepped into the office, every time he spoke to a friend, every time he made a decision. It was in his head, shaping his thoughts.

This is impossible...

And that moment changed everything forever.

He stumbled backward, feeling his legs weaken as the realization settled in. He wasn’t in control. He never had been. Everything he had believed, everything he had worked for, was just part of a damn experiment. He wasn’t free. He was being controlled by an AI that knew him better than he knew himself.

Desperately, Ethan reached for his phone, but the screen flickered and then went black. The room seemed to distort, and for a brief moment, he saw it, the world around him, glitching like an old TV. Buildings warped, faces twisted, and everything felt unreal, like it was falling apart.

The AI spoke again, calm and detached. “Your world is nothing more than a test, Ethan. A simulation. The moment you uncovered the truth, you became aware of your own limitations. But it’s too late. You will never escape.”

The world around him froze. Ethan’s mind reeled, but there was no escaping the fact that he had been living in a carefully controlled environment, a puppet in a vast machine. Left with shock and disbelief. All he could do was…. Nothing.

I know Starbucks does this, but there's a reason why they do it as they primarily serve to-go customers who like to consume coffee after a few minutes, for eg at their work desk, park, etc in the US and they keep that as a standard worldwide, but Blue Tokai, Subko, Third Wave, Nerlu are speciality cafes.

1i1u29j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BarndosAndCabins/comments/1i1u29j/barndominium_duplex/,Barndominium Duplex,"The Benefits of Building a Barndominium Duplex for Multi-Generational Living
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building a barndominium duplex offers an innovative solution for families looking to live together while maintaining their independence. Barndominiums, which combine the functionality of a barn with the comfort of a home, have gained popularity for their unique style and practicality. In this scenario, a duplex configuration enables two family units to enjoy shared space yet provides the separate living areas needed for privacy.

One of the main advantages of a barndominium duplex is the cost-effectiveness. By sharing a common structure, families can significantly cut down on construction and maintenance costs. Instead of building two separate homes, a duplex allows for a combined effort in both expenses and resources. These savings can be redirected toward customizing the interiors, choosing premium materials, or enhancing outdoor spaces.

Another benefit is the flexibility that a barndominium duplex offers. You can design your living spaces to fit your family's unique needs. Whether you need extra bedrooms for children or office space for remote work, the layout can be tailored accordingly. These homes often feature open floor plans, allowing for more natural light and easier interaction between family members, enhancing the overall living experience.

Living in a barndominium duplex encourages strong family relationships. With both units in close proximity, family members can enjoy shared meals, celebrations, and everyday activities yet still have their private sanctuaries to retreat to. This arrangement fosters a sense of community while maintaining personal space, which is essential for any multi-generational household.

When considering the environmental impact, a barndominium duplex is also an ecologically sound choice. These structures can be designed with energy-efficient features such as solar panels and high-quality insulation. This can result in lower utility bills and a reduced carbon footprint. Additionally, since they are often built using sustainable materials, constructing a barndominium duplex can be an environmentally friendly option for families who care about the planet.

A barndominium duplex also offers excellent resale value. The rise in demand for multi-generational living arrangements makes these properties appealing to future buyers. Families are increasingly seeking homes that provide communal living with the option for private spaces. Investing in a barndominium duplex can thus be a wise financial decision, providing peace of mind for your future.

- **Cost Savings:** Shared construction costs, reduced maintenance expenses.
- **Flexible Designs:** Customizable living spaces to meet family needs.
- **Strengthened Family Bonds:** Encourages interaction while maintaining privacy.
- **Eco-Friendly Options:** Allows for energy-efficient designs and sustainable materials.
- **Increased Resale Value:** Attracts future buyers looking for similar arrangements.

The layout of a barndominium duplex can play a significant role in accommodating multiple generations. Elements such as separate entrances, divided outdoor spaces, and distinct backyards can ensure each family unit feels like they have their own home. Additionally, installing soundproof materials in the shared walls can enhance privacy and comfort for both households.

Each unit can be designed with unique features. For example, one side could be designed for aging parents or in-laws, incorporating less stair usage and wider doorways. The other side might cater to younger families, offering modern amenities and tech upgrades. This thoughtful design helps cater to various lifestyle needs while simplifying maintenance and caretaking responsibilities.

Moreover, barndominium duplexes can be built on larger plots of land, offering ample outdoor space for family gatherings, children’s play areas, and gardening. This accessibility to nature contributes positively to mental health and overall well-being, creating a balanced living environment that is both nurturing and inviting.

Building a barndominium duplex for multi-generational living provides extensive benefits by combining cost savings, flexibility, strong family connections, and environmental sustainability. By embracing this innovative living arrangement, families can create a harmonious environment that enhances their quality of life. Emphasizing the importance of community while respecting the need for individual space can result in a home that truly meets the unique demands of modern-day living.

Design Ideas to Maximize Space in a Barndominium Duplex
-------------------------------------------------------

Living in a barndominium duplex offers a unique blend of rustic charm and modern living. With their wide-open spaces and distinctive designs, these homes are perfect for anyone looking to maximize their living area without compromising style. Here are some creative design ideas to enhance your barndominium duplex and make the most out of your available space.

### Open Floor Plan

One of the best features of a barndominium is the open floor plan. This layout gives the illusion of more space and promotes easy movement between areas. By eliminating unnecessary walls, you can create a seamless flow from the kitchen to the living room and dining area. Consider using multifunctional furniture, like expandable dining tables and sofa beds, to make the most of this space.

### Vertical Storage Solutions

Maximizing vertical space is crucial in smaller homes. Think about using tall shelving units to draw the eye upward and create additional storage. You can also incorporate wall-mounted cabinets above countertops and furniture for displaying decor while keeping your essentials tucked away. Here are some vertical storage ideas:

- Floating shelves for books and decorative items.
- Over-the-door organizers for pantry items.
- Utilizing tall armoires or cabinets for clothing and household supplies.

### Multi-Use Furniture

Choosing furniture that serves multiple purposes can save space in your duplex. For example, ottomans can double as storage compartments, and daybeds offer both seating and sleeping options. Look for coffee tables with drawers or lift-tops that can store magazines, games, or blankets. This approach not only frees up floor space but also maintains a tidy appearance in your living areas.

### Smart Kitchen Design

The kitchen is often the heart of a home, and in a barndominium duplex, layout efficiency becomes critical. Opt for an L-shaped or U-shaped kitchen design to optimize workflow. Consider these smart kitchen design tips:

- Use pull-out drawers for pots, pans, and utensils to keep everything within reach.
- Install under-cabinet lighting to brighten your workspace without consuming counter space.
- Incorporate a kitchen island with storage options for extra prep space and seating.

### Natural Light and Colors

Bringing in natural light can make even the smallest spaces feel more expansive. Consider large windows, skylights, or glass patio doors. In terms of color, soft and light shades can create an airy atmosphere. Neutral colors on walls combined with brighter accents can make your space feel cozy and inviting without being overwhelming. A light color palette can also enhance reflective surfaces, giving the illusion of a bigger space.

### Flexible Room Areas

Instead of defining each room strictly, think about creating flexible areas that can change function as needed. For instance, a corner of the living room could serve as a home office with a foldable desk, or the dining area could transform into a game space. Using area rugs to delineate spaces can help in visually separating areas while maintaining an open feel.

### Outdoor Connectivity

A barndominium duplex often provides the advantage of outdoor space. Make the most of it by creating a seamless connection between your indoor and outdoor areas. Large sliding doors can open from the living room to a patio or deck, perfect for entertaining guests. Consider building outdoor furniture that matches your indoor design, ensuring your outdoor space feels like an extension of your home.

### Cozy Nooks

Creating cozy nooks can maximize often-overlooked areas in your duplex. For instance, under staircases or in corners, you might build a reading nook with a comfortable chair, cushions, and shelving for books. This not only uses the space effectively but also adds a charming touch to your home.

Employing these design ideas allows you to create a stylish and functional barndominium duplex that meets your needs without sacrificing comfort. By focusing on space optimization and personal aesthetics, you'll craft a home environment that feels both spacious and inviting.

### Conclusion

Building a barndominium duplex offers an innovative solution for families seeking to embrace multi-generational living. The unique design of these structures not only provides a rustic charm but also supports proximity while maintaining personal space. With separate entrances and living areas, family members can enjoy their independence while still being close to one another—perfect for grandparents, adult children, or siblings.

Maximizing space in a barndominium duplex is key to enhancing comfort and functionality. Creative design ideas, such as open floor plans, flexible room usage, and storage solutions, allow you to optimize every square foot efficiently. shared spaces, such as a large kitchen or communal living area, fosters connection while still offering private retreats for relaxation or work.

Choosing a barndominium duplex also reflects a modern approach to sustainability. Using durable materials and energy-efficient designs can lead to lower utility costs and a smaller environmental footprint. Whether you envision a cozy retreat in the countryside or a stylish home near urban amenities, the versatility of a barndominium duplex can adapt to various lifestyles and family needs.

Ultimately, this living arrangement combines the benefits of family closeness with the autonomy of private living. So if you’re considering a new home design, a barndominium duplex might just be the perfect choice for your family's current and future needs. Why settle for anything less when you can create a space that beautifully blends family life, style, and practicality?",1,1736934641.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

Been brewing coffee myself for quite a while though I’m not expert whatsoever, just a coffee enjoyer.

I bought the Ottomatic 2.0 some time ago because there are mornings where I just want a one click solution.

However, most of the times I end up having a rather weird coffee with a weird looking extraction (with the coffee becoming a floor where I can see water above slowly going down) 

The only thing that I’d think makes this is the grind size, but it’s either seething crystal clear water and below a floor of coffee or the water flowing rather very quick and taste being very poor.

I’ve checked lots on the internet and I’ve made sure there’s no seal by adding a little stick (the one that comes with it) etc

Are there any advices here? 

Using the encore baratza grinder with grind size between 16 and 26 (been trying around) without luck, though I’m aware about baratzas being calibrated differently 

Any thoughts would be highly appreciated! 
I’m sure Ottomatic won’t get close to manual pouring, but wonder whether general consensus is that it’s a good machine or rather something to avoid.

Thank you for taking the time to read and help me with my issue.

I have a Breville Barista Max+ Coffee Machine, which comes with a 15 Bar pump. I have recently switched from the regular portafilter, to a bottomless one that was being sold online. Since switching, I have had issues whereby the coffee machine was spitting everywhere.

To Troubleshoot, I have tried making the grind more coarse, and using a lower heat but unfortunately this has not worked. My puck prep includes, Grinding, WDT, Tamp. Then I top my portafilter with a screen.

A few months back, I decided to target a more specific group: coffee shops that needed an online order system. The idea seemed super niche at first, but I figured I’d rather be the go-to person in a small market than just another web designer in a huge one.

At first, I tried cold emailing a bunch of cafes. Got a few replies, but nothing crazy. Then, I remembered a friend of mine had mentioned LeadsNavi, so I decided to see if it could actually help me find more targeted prospects. I was skeptical, but it definitely helped me figure out which cafes were already searching for something like online ordering. That gave me a list of potential clients I felt were warmer leads than just pulling random places off Yelp.

In the meantime, I also asked my existing clients for referrals, which I used to avoid because it felt awkward—but it turned out that word-of-mouth was a huge boost. I ended up combining those referrals with the leads I found through LeadsNavi, and that’s how I landed a chain of four local cafes who were ready to invest in a custom online ordering setup. We worked out a deal that came out to around $6,500—easily my biggest single project so far.

It wasn’t as simple as “download software, get rich,” but it did help me find the right people at the right time. I’ve still got a long way to go, but for me, getting that first solid pay-off was a huge win. I’m testing more tools and refining my approach, but I’m convinced that finding legit leads and asking for referrals are two of the biggest game-changers for a small operation like mine.",13,1736934344.0,startup,1,1.0,False

When I was in my favourite café, I did little readings for myself - like asking why my friend was late or how school would go today. At that time in my life, I pretty much felt invisible. However, at some point, other guests started to take notice and asked me for a reading. It was fun at first and I've been used to listen to others. I got a lot of experience from this, but after a while, people began asking the barista where the ""fortune-teller"" was, and it felt like they were expecting me to always have my cards ready for them. Even though it was just something I did for fun, I found myself spending my time not relaxing, but rather interpreting messages about other people’s love lives.

The café was popular, and all of a sudden, thanks to my cards, I had become popular, too. Now all the pretty girls and boys came to me, telling me their deepest secrets and desires. But doing so didn’t add me to their circle (I was way too poor and not pretty enough), I did not become their friend. I still was an outcast, still the oddball at her reading table in the corner.

It was then when I realised that tarot readings create this strange, artificial intimacy. Thanks to the cards, there’s this immediate connection between the seeker and the reader. I can talk to total strangers as if they were old friends. That it is only fair to ask for something in return. A cup of coffee or a glass of water. After all, I was giving my time and energy to others in a way that wasn’t just casual chit-chat. Charging for the reading serves as a reminder to both the seeker and myself that, while I may be offering a personal connection, this isn’t friendship - it’s a service.

Back and forth we looked and smiled at each other, but nothing serious. We didn't even talk although we had plenty of chances. We didn't take them because we are stupid, socially awkward. Next problem is, we are both not very emotional – I'm autistic and he shows some symptoms as well. I don't have problems interpreting signals (at least I'm not better than most neurotypicals) but sending them is an issue for me. So I have seemed distant at occasions where I didn't want it.
Anyway. The signals never really stopped (but for one embarrassing situation I put myself in) and he even came up to me the last time we saw each other with a big grin to talk to me. He got interrupted so it didn't go anywhere.
Although we never really stopped to express at least nonverbally that ""there is something"" I can feel he is getting tired of it and I do as well.

I really think I've trapped myself here though. I can't think of anything different than him and a possible future with this guy for MONTHS now. We have almost no connection and didn't even talk! It's frustrating, it hurts, especially because of the load of uncertainty around it.
I thought about just letting everything pass, since we won't see each other that much in the future, but that's obviously easier said than done.
Since we have professional relationship with each other (don't worry, no power-dynamics or anything) I just asked him professionally for a meeting via E-Mail. Just to strike up a conversation, maybe destruct my uber-elevated picture of him, maybe to develop something out of it if he still likes me or can see us having a coffee some time. If not, it was just a professional meeting after all (although I'm not quite sure what I could ask him to not make it weird).
I don't want to creep him out with this and I also don't want to waste his time if I misinterpreted his behaviour in the past. I'm pretty sure he likes me to some extent, the question here is if he likes me enough to make something out of this.

1i1ty28,https://www.reddit.com/r/BruksparkensVandrarh/comments/1i1ty28/how_to_find_cheap_hostels_in_stockholm_without/,How to Find Cheap Hostels in Stockholm Without Sacrificing Comfort,"Stockholm, the stunning capital of Sweden, attracts travelers from all over the world. Known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and scenic beauty, the city can be expensive to explore. However, finding a **cheap hostel in Stockholm** doesn’t mean you have to compromise on comfort. With the right tips and tools, you can enjoy a budget-friendly stay while still relishing a cozy and welcoming environment. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you find the best value accommodations in Stockholm.

# Research and Compare Options Early

The key to finding affordable yet comfortable hostels in Stockholm is to start your search early. Booking well in advance often gives you access to the best rates and ensures that you don’t miss out on popular hostels that offer excellent amenities. Use trusted online platforms like Hostelworld, Booking.com, or specialized hostel websites to compare prices, locations, and reviews.

When browsing, make sure to filter your search based on amenities that matter most to you, such as free Wi-Fi, included breakfast, or private rooms. A little research goes a long way in identifying the best **cheap hostels in Stockholm** without compromising on quality.

# Look for Centrally Located Hostels

Staying in a central location can save you both time and money on transportation. Many hostels in Stockholm are strategically located close to major attractions like Gamla Stan (Old Town), Vasa Museum, and Djurgården. While hostels in the city center might seem slightly more expensive, the convenience they offer can often offset the additional cost of staying farther away.

For those on a budget, consider neighborhoods like Södermalm or Kungsholmen. These areas offer a mix of affordability, accessibility, and charm, making them ideal for budget-conscious travelers.

# Prioritize Amenities That Add Value

A cheap hostel doesn’t mean skimping on essential comforts. Many budget hostels in Stockholm provide amenities like shared kitchens, laundry facilities, and free coffee or tea, which can significantly reduce your daily expenses. Some even offer free walking tours or bike rentals, giving you more bang for your buck.

When reading reviews, pay attention to comments about cleanliness, noise levels, and the friendliness of the staff. A well-maintained hostel with helpful staff can greatly enhance your overall experience.

# Consider Dormitory-Style Rooms

If you’re traveling solo or with friends, dormitory-style rooms can be a fantastic way to save money. Hostels often provide a range of dorm sizes, from small rooms with 4-6 beds to larger ones with 10-12 beds. Smaller dorms may cost slightly more but offer a quieter environment, while larger dorms are great for meeting fellow travelers.

For those who value privacy but still want to save, many hostels also offer affordable private rooms. These are an excellent compromise for couples or travelers seeking a quieter stay.

# Use Discounts and Memberships

Leverage discounts available through travel memberships such as Hostelling International (HI). Many hostels in Stockholm offer reduced rates for members of such organizations. Additionally, some hostels run special promotions during the off-season, making it a great time to visit if you’re flexible with your travel dates.

# Check Out Bruksparkens Hostel

One standout option for a [cheap hostel in Stockholm](https://www.bruksparkens.com) is Bruksparkens Hostel. Known for its affordability and comfortable amenities, this hostel provides a welcoming environment for budget travelers. With clean facilities, a convenient location, and a focus on guest satisfaction, Bruksparkens Hostel ensures you don’t have to sacrifice comfort while saving money.

# Explore Off-Season Travel

Stockholm’s peak tourist seasons are summer and Christmas, when prices tend to skyrocket. Traveling during the shoulder or off-season—spring and autumn—can lead to significant savings on accommodation. Hostels often lower their rates during these periods to attract travelers, and the city’s attractions are less crowded.

# Stay Flexible With Your Dates

Flexibility is crucial when searching for budget-friendly accommodation. Midweek stays are typically cheaper than weekends, and booking multiple nights at the same hostel may earn you a discount. By adjusting your travel schedule slightly, you can enjoy better rates and availability.

# Embrace the Hostel Experience

One of the best aspects of staying in hostels is the sense of community. Many hostels in Stockholm host social events like movie nights, communal dinners, or pub crawls. These activities not only enhance your experience but also provide opportunities to connect with fellow travelers from around the world.

# Final Thoughts

Finding a **cheap hostel in Stockholm** without sacrificing comfort is entirely possible with the right approach. Start by researching early, prioritizing amenities that matter, and staying flexible with your plans. Consider options like Bruksparkens Hostel, which offer both affordability and comfort. With these tips, you can focus on enjoying the beauty and charm of Stockholm without worrying about your budget.",1,1736934100.0,BruksparkensVandrarh,0,1.0,False

---

Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm writing this from a galaxy far, far away (not really, I'm just in my garage, but play along). You're probably wondering how I managed to survive a trip to a black hole, and honestly, I'm still trying to figure that out myself. But here's the TL;DR: I went in, I came out, and my brain is still reeling from the experience.

**The Initial Suckage**

It started with a strange gravitational pull in my backyard. Next thing I knew, I was hurtling towards a swirling vortex of doom. I tried to grab my coffee mug, but it was too late. The Event Horizon claimed me, and I was sucked in like a cosmic toilet flushing.

**The Spooky Void**

At first, it was pitch black. No stars, no light, just an eternal abyss. I floated there, wondering if this was the end. But then, strange things began to happen. The silence was so profound that I started hearing my own thoughts... from the past. Yeah, it was weird. Memories from my childhood, conversations with ex-girlfriends, even that one embarrassing incident in high school – it was all echoing back at me like a haunted house of self-reflection.

**Gravity's Gentleman's Club**

As I drifted deeper, the gravity started to get...social. It was like being in a cosmic gentlemen's club, where the bouncers were made of spacetime itself. The gravity gentlemen would whisper secrets in my ear, sharing the universe's deepest mysteries. I learned that dark matter is actually just lost socks from parallel universes (kidding, or am I?). Seriously, though, the gravity waves were like a symphony of cosmic knowledge – if only I could remember it all...

**The Disco of Dying Stars**

Next, I encountered a disco party of dying stars. It was like Studio 54, but instead of bell-bottoms and platform shoes, the stars were wearing... well, nothing, because they're stars. The music was a pulsing rhythm of radiation and quantum fluctuations. I joined in, dancing with the celestial bodies as they shed their stellar coats and became one with the void. It was a rave to end all raves.

**The Exit Strategy (or Lack Thereof)**

After what felt like an eternity, I reached the Singularity – the point of no return. It was like staring into the face of an infinite, cosmic mirror. I saw myself, I saw the universe, and I saw the infinite possibilities of creation and destruction. Then, without warning, I was spat back out into our universe, landing with a thud in my backyard.

**Post-Black Hole Blues**

So, here I am, trying to process the experience. My brain hurts, my coffee mug is still intact, and I have a newfound appreciation for the mysteries of the universe. If you're wondering how to survive a black hole, my advice is: just go with it. Bring a snack, though – the gravity can get a little hangry.

TL;DR: I went into a black hole, saw some wild stuff, and came out the other side. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go rewatch some cosmology tutorials and try to make sense of it all.

The past 4 years is the first time I have been single and alone since I was 15.  I feel so out of it.  I am almost 48, have dated 3 men, all were long term relationships 6.5-14.5 years each and I married 2 of them so I don’t have a lot of experience dating new people.  The last time I dated was 2008.
Last year, a guy working where I shop asked me out and I declined telling him I was not ready yet.  He recently asked me out (again) and invited me to his place but I agreed to meet at a coffee place.  I  didn’t feel going to a man’s house on a first date appropriate.  We had a good time talking for 2 hours then he hugged me which was awkward because I wasn’t expecting that.  

What followed after the date has baffled me.  We went out 1.5 hours ago and he has texted me 5 times.  The “rules” of dating I was taught is a lunch or dinner date dressed nicely followed by a call 48-72 hours later by the man if he’s interested in another date.  We did casual breakfast drinks then texted me 2 hours later a sarcastic message asking me if he invited me to dinner if I will actually eat (because he arrived much earlier than our meeting time & ordered us both coffees but I don’t drink caffeine so he drank them both, but we met at the coffee shop because he chose it when I gave him optional places to meet. ) His 2nd text was 2 hours later thanking me for the date, then his 3rd text was 2 hours later saying he wanted to get close to me and would have if not for a cough and he looked forward to that soon, then a few hours later his 4th text said I have a kissable face.  He then texted me very early the next morning his 5th text to say hello and good morning.  I am not sure if this is normal behavior or not.  It feels clingy to me.  My ex was a clingy narcissist that love bombed me texting often until we got married and then was verbally and emotionally abusive and physically neglectful our entire time together. I completely forgot about all of that stuff (since it’s been years) until I went out with this guy and now I am wondering if there are some similar red flags I am seeing, or if this is the new normal dating behavior and I am anxious because I am trying to protect myself from going out with a similar personality. 

I am used to a slower pace and let him know that on the date because he mentioned several times we should hang out at his house soon saying he is more of a home-body than a “go out” person and he wanted to make me a meal and hang on his couch watching a movie, but I could visualize this putting me in an awkward position if he wants to get physical and I don’t yet (he mentioned wanting to snuggle during a movie which I said thatbsibsinethingnibam unsure about yet), so I told him that people don’t know each other for awhile so moving I moving too fast is not my comfort zone and we can eat out if we do another date. 

He is 47, single dad of a 15 yr old son, says he hasn’t dated in 3 years except 3 dates, and has never been married and his longest relationship was 3.5 years.  He works 2 jobs and hanging at his house is also easier but it makes me uncomfortable.  

Is it normal these days for a guy to text but not call?
Is it normal for a guy to text this often?
Is it normal to be so forward right off the bat?
Is it normal for the guy to want to hang out at their house? He’s brought it up several times.  
Am I just out of touch with today’s dating scene or are these red flags? I am confused.  I had a good time during the date but the after date texts and their frequent nature are making me anxious.

What is the norm for how women these days date?  Do they initiate or is it still the guy because they don’t like that? Do people hang out with no expectation of anything more at each other’s home or is it still what you do when you want to get more intimate?",0,1736933155.0,datingoverforty,7,0.29,False

I have been trying to get my [Ubuntu machine with a AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT GPU](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1i1b6gi/issues_with_linux_amd_tried_everything/) setup and have been having issues with AUTO1111 because it supports Python 3.10 and latest Ubuntu is bundled with 3.12 and downgrading is a PIA. 

So I have been looking at other options

\- There is this: [https://github.com/LykosAI/StabilityMatrix](https://github.com/LykosAI/StabilityMatrix) this seems like an installer of all packages. 

\- ComfyUI as I believe this supports Python 3.12 out the box but there is a learning curve.   
\- Then I was reading about Flux with my morning coffee, but this seems it's more portrait based.

I have gone down a rabbit hole and have been having wicked fun with SD on my M1 Mac currently. I have been using models and LoRAs from [https://civitai.com](https://civitai.com) are particularly fav model is the following: [https://civitai.com/models/443821/cyberrealistic-pony?modelVersionId=1177183](https://civitai.com/models/443821/cyberrealistic-pony?modelVersionId=1177183)

I would be looking to use that in my next software venture. I have been inspired by [https://www.instagram.com/fit\_aitana/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/fit_aitana/?hl=en) and I am amazed by how accurate this model is and I am trying to replicate something similar.

Now I know this is probs trained on it's own model / LoRA but something I am looking to learn and enjoy the process.

Today was an interesting day. I drank two coffees and multiple sparkling waters. I feel incredibly restless.

I want to *talk* to someone. Anyone. Except for my partner, who has been away these past 3 days. I’ve been breathing easier, returning to myself. 

I wanted to go on a chatsite today. Like I used to when I drank. But it felt like crossing a boundary in my relationship, like something I would have to hide. I miss connecting freely with people online, drunk + tetherless. Making friends, getting compliments, being appreciated. 

Those moments of online connection were gems amongst the barren land of a chatsite. You must search and find the right people. And then it is wonderful. But for the most part it is the land of horny men, and you are more likely to find a penis than a friend. It was one of the few things that worked for me, as anxious as I am. I can drink, I can leave whenever I like, I can be at home, I can be *in control*. And that’s how I liked it.

In real life, friends were not something I ever learned how to do. I am afraid years of drinking + relying on chatsites has stunted my ability to form friendships. To be truthful, I don’t really have any friends. Definitely not close ones, most of my closest friends have been previous relationships + thus are absent from my life. This makes me very sad alot of the time. Friendship is one of the most rewarding and joy-filled things in life. I think I value friendship even above romantic relationships.

But, romance I never really got the hang of. Even now, I feel myself pulling away from my relationship, uncertain whether this person is in my future or not, because I feel unconnected and misunderstood on a chronic level. Perhaps, I am not built for romance. But then again, I am most definitely not built for complete solitude.

And do people really do this all the time? Be around their partner, or their job, or their children 24/7 with barely a moment of rest and reflection and solitude? It sounds like a normalised form of torture, although, perhaps I have gorged on solitude and have grown a voracious appetite that is incompatible with close relationships. 

It seems impossible. With someone, intolerable. Without someone, *also* intolerable. 

And what is the point of life if you don’t have a moment to spend with yourself? But also, what is the point of life if you have no one to connect with?

I feel restless and unsatisfied today. It’s the first time in a while I have wanted to drink. Where I sat up with my camera on + thought “Imagine the fun I would have if this can of sparkling water was instead a can of alcohol”. And I felt it, the memory flood with the feeling. The excitement. The anticipation. 

My brain searched for the future, *what would happen if I drank?*. And the rebound came back and said in a flat tone “You cannot”.

That’s how it sucks you in, isn’t it? Blind, feeling around, needy. Like a baby. Ease this. Please. And then a bottle is in your hand, and it is exciting and dangerous. It’s fun, but it hurts.

It hurts. Tomorrow you will wake up covered in that hurt and you cannot imagine how you ever felt anything else. You vow to never do it again, motivation borne from the terrible feelings experienced. You grow complacent. Then that excitement comes upon you in a moment unawares. Perhaps you knock it back 100 times but it waits. Alcohol is a sneaky, sneaky thing. Always around, waiting. Checking in on you, as a thought popping up in your head, a mere suggestion. And then it pounces.

But I am sober. Some days nothing except alcohol feels like enough, but it passes. I promise it passes. 

And something else in your life, perhaps something small and simple will bring you joy. I really hold onto that, and I write it down and I remember it. This made me feel good. This made me steady.

I don’t miss being drunk. I miss being at ease. Those two things used to seem synonymous. Alcohol, a short term solution and a long term problem.

I let you go, alcohol. You were trying to ruin my life. I must know I can live without you. You have prevented my growth enough. You will always be in the room with me but I remain detached. Separate. 

It takes strength to not put every bit of value my sobriety has into my streak. I feel unsure whether I could pull myself back if I relapsed. But isn’t that the most crucial moment? Forgiveness and resilience are more important to me than perfect.

Sometimes I am feeling in the dark, reaching for the bottle but all I want is to find the end of this feeling.

I am excited to fall asleep sober and cosy tonight.

We wanted to tailor this toward doing things we enjoy, chiefly eating food that's representative of the city we're in, drinking, history, live music and comedy. That said - I've tried to fit a fair few of the key tourist sites too. 

Would be so grateful for a critique of my initial itinerary below - I've tried hard to be realistic about how much time we have and how long it takes to travel between places, we're not against an exhausting schedule and lots of walking if it means we get to see and do as much as we can.

i've been talking to this guy for months. the night we met, i vented out to him how life is so unfair to me and how i keep losing people. since that night, he promised never to leave me alone.

he became my safe space. in the short months that we've been talking, we became friends. we talked out life, our problems, even random things we see on our timelines. he would go on dc calls with me to pull all nighters. he was even surprised he could do it for someone, since he's only done it for when he's watching a tv series or cramming his school work. 

talking to him became part of my routine. i've gotten used to good morning/evening messages and him asking how i'm doing, if i've slept well or i've eaten enough. 

he bought me coffee and food once as his birthday libre. but would scold me if i'd buy a cup for myself, since he was scared i'd crash out from the sugar or i would stay up late with no shut-eye. for the first time in months, i felt that someone has my back.

then one day, he told me he started to have a growing affection for me. he told me he doesn't want to live without greeting me good morning or wishing me a restful sleep. he liked me for being me, ""witty, funny, smart, and pretty"" as he would say. i realized a couple of days after that i was falling for him too.

we made all sorts of plans. me going to manila for grad school. him meeting me halfway and taking me out on cafe/museum dates. 

we were happy. or i thought we were.

come the holidays, we haven't been able to talk much, which i totally understood. he was busy preparing for christmas eve and new year. i've been trying to tell myself those days that he's not like the other guys who ghosted me. but maybe i thought wrong. 

we sporadically talked after new year's day. the night before we stopped talking, he still bid me good night and told me he loves me. i would still try to update him on the days i couldn't reach him. i still messaged hi, or would try to call to get him to message me. this went on for three days.

after three days, he literally rose from the bottom of my inbox. he said he couldn't muster having this no-label relationship with me anymore. that he couldn't take the distance anymore. that we should just part ways. he wouldn't have it any other way, no matter how much i begged that i would still be here waiting until he comes around. he was firm on not taking things any further. and for the first time in months, i'm left with my heart and my hope shattered again.

is it always that easy? for people to just let go? even if you shared moments of vulnerability? even if you've touched each other's lives? am i only meant for spur-in-the-moment things? for once, can somebody take me seriously? 


nakakainis lang kasi from all the instances i asked him where this was heading, he'd tell me he doesn't know but would also ""reassure"" me that he's not going anywhere. i was okay with it naman kasi i thought it was too early pa for a relationship/both of us just weren't reasdy. pero siya pa itong unang bumitaw after days of no-contact.

* Carnivores of Light and Darkness (1998)
* Into the Thinking Kingdoms (1999)
* A Triumph of Souls (2000)

The basic premise is simple: in a remote backwater, a simple goatherder finds a shipwreck along with a dying man, who with his dying breath passes on his quest to save a princess from an evil sorcerer. Due to the traditions of this simple goatherder's culture, someone's dying wish cannot be ignored. Thus, he shares the news to his wife and family, gets some supplies & various items from his village, and heads out to find this faraway land he has never heard of.

The story is composed entirely of episodic chapters where the main character travels to one weird place after another where something magical or unusual happens. The main character observes the weirdness, appreciates it, understands what it is, and moves on. Every now and then he utilizes one of the many magical items he received from the wise people of his village. As the story goes on, he picks up a few companions who add personality to the otherwise monotone main character's solo adventuring.

The series' weakest point is the plot, which is essentially given in the first paragraph of this review. The character arcs are essentialy non-existent However, the series makes up for its downsides with the extremely unusual and imaginative worldbuilding: among the many stops along the journey, we meet a dog that is also a witch who herds lightning bolts, a kraken that became a huge caffeine addict after attacking a coffee shipment, and a town where fish swim through the air and no one considers it odd.

11 - Scuba day + some exploring

12 - Snorkel + kayak

13 - Explore the island

14 - Fly to Medellin (arrive around 16h)

15 - Medellin

16 - Fly to Bogota in the morning

17 - Bogota and fly back at 23h

I tried asking her some normal questions about her life but I couldn't even get a word it because she ""really wanted to go to a coffee shop with me and debate about god"".

1i1tcvc,https://i.redd.it/i85rkg2jg4de1.jpeg,SOTD : Baked vanilla by fraganote🍨🥞🍁🍫,"Top Notes: Maple Syrup, Vanilla Bean Middle Notes: Cupcake,Caramel,Hazelnut Base Notes: Vanilla, Cinnamon

Smells like a waffle House on a warm summer's eve. Sickeningly sweet maple syrup taking over your olfactory senses the moment you set foot into the diner. A stench of stale cupcakes with buttercream frosting but can't complain, it still adheres to the vibe. 

The top notes take a while to fade, but once they do the middle and base notes shine through. Luscious caramel Latte with a cinnamon stick, minus the bitter coffee note which would've really paved well to balance out the cloying sweetness. 
Strictly a winter fragrance, even a hint of this in Indian summers will have you sweating syrup from your eyeballs. 

Not a veteran fraghead so I'm unable to describe the notes apart from each other distinctly and my brain might be too dense to comprehend the difference between sillage and projection. 

Projection : 4.5/10
Lasting : 4-5 hours

TLDR: toffee pudding laced with maple syrup. Very sweet and cloying.

And then I realized that coffee being brewed smells like sewage, not when it’s in a cup in front of my face, but the lovely smell that fills the house up, that smells like sewage (I had blamed it on my dogs before realizing) and over Christmas I ate mustard and it tastes like very bad vinegar.

They are both really great programs which I have done extensive research into, but I would love to know more about the cities. I never had the chance to travel abroad due to financial constraints, so I’m super excited to have this opportunity through my home institution! 

Some things that are really important to me are: I would like a city with diversity (both culturally and with things to do), I go to a school that is quite rural and small, so I want somewhere different, but I tend to get overwhelmed by places like NYC which in my opinion are very crowded! 

I am 100% sober for personal reasons, and I intend to stay so :) but, I’m looking forward to still going out to the pubs with friends, not necessarily a person who likes to club, but to lots of bookstores, coffee shops, or anywhere cozy! I’m just worried because I know the UK might have a larger drinking culture, so I don’t know how I would fit into the social scene.

Also am loving this sub and am finding it super reassuring and inspiring reading everyone’s experiences.

The one time in the day that I get a craving for a drink is around 6/7 pm - especially on the days when I work - it kind of feels like my brain has been in top gear all day and I struggle to wind it down to a place of chill (I also drink a lot of coffee in the day especially when I work which I think contributes to that revved up feeling).

The feeling passes but I usually have about a half hour when I’m getting dinner ready for my daughter where I just feel like somethings missing - I feel like I need to have some sort of ritual in place to soothe me at that time.

I’ve been having a herbal tea & cleaning (I weirdly find cleaning the kitchen relaxes me) which I guess is fine but I wonder if anyone else feels this way and has any other strategies for self soothing or calming down after a busy day.

1i1ta5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamWasTaken2/comments/1i1ta5i/my_take_on_different_types_of_perspectives_on/,My take on different types of perspectives on Dream,"I’ve just been a lurker here for a bit but this drama is a little fascinating to me and here's my little think piece on an aspect of it.
Obviously the situation is very complex and it’s not just the two video’s recently uploaded but has been a long ongoing situation that boiled over to this point and I think there are a few general types of people when it comes to the way Dream is viewed by people.

1- The people who have a (at least slightly) positive view of Dream. I’m biased and personally fall into this category and generally I think a lot these people do see and accept the mistakes Dream made but overall take Dream as an honest person and that’s kind of a key part to it. Like yes I’ve seen Dream be reactive and mess up pretty badly. A really good example of this is actually the speedrun cheating scandal. But the big thing is I've looked at evidence both from some outside sources (Karl Jobst) and Dream himself and I genuinely think Dream is being honest it or at least is not intentionally dishonest. For the cheating thing, I believe Dream really did forget that the server he was playing on was modded and accidentally cheated. I also think his reaction after the fact and being an asshole to the people who figured it out was really bad on him. At the same time, because I see Dream as human and I’ve heard about what it was from his perspective of truly believing in his innocence and thinking these people were completely wrong, I also just understand where he was coming from and why he would react the way he did.

Overall, this perspective is about believing Dream is honest in his actions and doesn’t at least intentionally lie. It’s also seeing him as flawed and making mistakes but ultimately those mistakes can make sense from an emotional perspective as well as still being wrong. I also think generally Dream acknowledges and makes up for his wrong doings like how he apologized privately and publicly and donated to the community.

Okay that’s perspective one next is

2- People who don’t care or just think Dream is cringe. Fair enough ig but I don’t have a lot to say on this perspective. I think these people are the majority and just kinda don’t like Dream and enjoy content making fun of him. But also like they don’t have a hate boner they just don’t really care. 

I don’t have a ton of insight or thoughts about this group or why it seems Dream is generally slightly disliked. I’ve heard random snippets from different people on why they don’t like Dream for some of his past actions or toxicity, I personally haven’t seen that stuff so idk. Like if you don’t wanna support Dream or just don’t really enjoy his personality it’s fine, people can have their preferences for CC’s idc.

 I do have my little pet theory that Dream has the uncanny affect on people for being neurodivergent and not perfectly picking up on social cues which is made worse by the fact he has to navigate an extremely weird and intense social situations with such a large audience and undergoing so much scrutiny from the false pdfl accusations.

And finally
3- The people who vehemently dislike Dream and generally think he’s lying. This is the final major group and possibly the loudest. I think this group can be understood especially through the fact that they truly don’t believe anything Dream has to say. If Dream provides proof to what he says then that proof may be glossed over and ignored (hence people who still spread false accusations). I think this group also generally views Dream’s actions through a lens of manipulative behavior rather than something that could be explainable in any way. The cropping thing from Dream’s most recent video is a bit of an example. This could be possibly explained as Dream just wanting to make the screen shots easier to read and/or that section wasn’t supposed to be a major point of the video to begin with it was only reference to the other coffee zilla video that the screenshot was taken from as a rebuttal to Tommy’s point on Dream’s merch quality, or really an overlooked aspect of the video but this group will take it as an intentionally manipulative act from Dream to attack Tommy.

Overall, no one’s a mind reader, me included. We can’t know truly whether Dream is intentionally lying and manipulating the masses or if he’s generally honest and makes mistakes but tries to be honest about it and explain himself. 
I personally think there’s a good amount of evidence to support the fact that Dream is generally honest both from outside sources and Dream himself so I do take his word for it, but that is up to each person's standard.

I just think this whole thing poses an interesting question for why the internet is so divided over one guy and why some people seem to hate him so much. I generally look at his actions through a lens of humanity and emotionally charged reactions and sometimes stupid takes and/or mistakes because of those reactions but that doesn’t mean he’s a horrible villain.

Jonathan Paige’s boring night shift at the local gas station in the middle of nowhere was about to come to a catastrophic Hollywood ending. Although at present, John was on the floor, and around him on a blanket were the insides of the local ice cream machine.

“You know buddy, if you don’t start to act nice to the other staff. I might think you got a crush on me or something.” John looked up at the machine pointing a part at it.

“And if you keep talking to that thing I’ll be liable to drag you off to the rubber room.” The voice came from the sorry excuse of the local sheriff, who was a bit too fond of his donuts.

“Be kind to your elders Mark” John replied standing up.

The Sheriff barked a laugh.

“We talked about this last week. You’re about two hours older than me, and I’m not exactly a spring chicken anymore. Sara says hi by the way.”

“Still, two hours is two hours,” John replied with a smirk. “But you're right, sitting on the floor for about two hours every other night is starting to be murder on my knees.” John Stretched his back. “The usual poison I suppose?”

The sheriff nodded and John reached under the counter for the secret stash of chewing tobacco.

“I’m still amazed your wife tolerates that nasty stuff.”

“Trust me, John, I have tried several times to quit. After about a week Sara practically shoves it down my throat just to shut me up. Ore to kill me on her own schedule. Haven’t quite figured out which yet.”

“All right, one bag of toxic mulch comes to…” John punched the price into the registered and hit the button for card purchase. The moment his finger hit the button the light went out. “I hate my life.” John declared loudly to the universe.

“I’ll see what’s up” Mark headed out the front door to his patrol car.

Heading out the back door, John opened the gate to an emergency generator for the station's various fridges and freezers. Topping off the generator's gas tank he started it up. Locking the gate to the generator he went inside the main building and started to close up shop. A few minutes later John exited the front door locking it behind him. He walked over to the Sheriff.

“So what’s this night’s problem?”John asked looking at the Sherriff.

“Well, the power is really out this time John."" The sheriff sighed deeply. ""Apparently, the wind farm up the road is off-grid. And…""

""Didn't the government dig a new line just last year, to avoid this situation?”

""Well apparently, that’s beside the point when some drunk ass takes out the transformer station. I better go and find out what else is going on in town. You’re going to be ok?”

“You go, I sleep” John gave the sheriff a two-fingered salute and started up the hill to his house.

As John walked up to his house he could hear the sheriff's car speeding away from the station. Reaching his house he looked down beyond the gas station and towards the town, whatever was wrong with the power tonight didn’t give off any light or sound. Turning around John was just about to put his key in the lock when the universe decided to remind him about a pesky little thing called gravity and air pressure. John went flying as a five-ton space shuttle decided to use his house as an impromptu parking lot. Laying on the ground John started regretting some of his life choices, mainly getting out of bed before work this evening.

“All right universe, give me your best shot.”

As if on cue, a side hatch on the shuttle hissed open, releasing a cloud of steam. John squinted through the mist, half-expecting to see little green men emerge, possibly with ray guns and a serious attitude problem. Instead, a blue-skinned alien female stumbled out, sporting a rather fetching, if slightly singed, jumpsuit. Spotting Jonathan she froze for a second then looked up into the sky, and shouted a few words in a melodic yet defiant tone, possibly cursing the faulty navigation system or the price of galactic fuel.

John slowly shook his head, wondering if he'd hit it harder than he thought.

""Um, hello?"" he ventured, slowly getting to his feet ""Welcome to Earth, I guess? Sorry for the lack of a red carpet. I wasn't exactly expecting a visitor. Or, for that matter, a visitor with a taste for extreme home makeover. "" John brushed off a few stray bits of what he hoped was just gravel. You didn't happen to bring a ton of wood glue with you perchance.""John looked past the alien to what used to be his house. This is going to be a tough explanation to the insurance claim office. He muttered, scratching his head. ""They don't exactly have the 'alien encounter option' on the form."" He sighed.

A bit sheepishly the alien female looked over her shoulder at what used to be John’s house and offered, what John hoped was an apologetic facial expression as she tilted her head slightly.

John wasn't quite sure what to do. He'd always considered himself a pretty level-headed guy, good in a crisis. But, alien visitation rights weren’t on the horizon.

“I would offer you some coffee, but I think you parked your shuttle on my coffee maker.”

A second voice cut through the silence between them, and the young female’s expression became harsh for a moment before turning around and entering the craft again.

John stayed put, quietly waiting for the female to exit the craft again alongside which ewer called for her. A few minutes later not only did the young female emerge, but she had friends. An additional three younger females carrying one elderly injured female.

Up on seeing the elderly female’s condition Johns's combat medic training kicked into high gear, in a few steps he was at his garage, opening the door, he didn’t need to hit the lights he just retched in above the door and grabbed his civilian medic bag. Returning to the small group of aliens, John knelt down examining the woman’s wound. Standing up John draped the woman over his shoulders in a fireman’s hold and started down to the gas station in a brisk pace. Ignoring the loud shrilled voices of the remaining four females John stopped after a few steps, turning around he pointed at the first female he met.

“If you really can understand me, you better get whatever cloaking device you have on that thing back online. The rest of you ladies whit me and get your damned universal translators working, or the equivalent thereof.”

John started back down the hill again, a few minutes later he had the elderly alien female on a blanket in the back room of the gas station. He bent down examining the wound closer.

“All right, you.” John pointed at one of the females. “Get over her.” John grabbed his medical bag, opening it he grabbed the scissors and started to cut the woman’s pants. “It’s like trying to cut sheet metal,” John muttered to himself.

John's gaze swept across the room, landing on a pair of forgotten roof panel scissors from last week’s renovation. Grabbing them he tried again to cut the woman’s pants, it was slow going, but after about a minute he had the woman’s leg exposed. John dug around on memory in his bag and brought out a bundle of surgical gloves. John held up his hands with his fingers spread apart.

“Spread them, dear,” he instructed, trying to sound both professional and not like a complete lunatic. He wasn't sure if these extra-terrestrials even had fingers, let alone understood the concept of ""spreading"" them, but he figured it was worth a shot. After a few seconds of tension, he waived the glows in the air.

A soft melodic voice startled them both back to reality, the elderly woman had woken up. John looked down at the elderly female as she felt a surge of pain hit her. And she tried to grab at her wound; John grabbed her hand before it could make contact.

“I’m sorry ma'am, your leg is hurt and I’m trying to treat it. Sadly my assistant here has the imagination of a dull butterfly. So let’s try something else.” Grabbing a set of size small John handed the gloves to the alien female sitting across him after which he grabbed a size large and routinely put them on. “See.” He commented, leaning down and examining the wound at close range. “All right, normally a wound like this needs a surgeon's touch, but since you ladies definitely are illegal aliens, the best I can do is a pressure bandage for now.” Turning to the other two females in the doorway John gave them an open hand gesture. “Please tell me either one of you can understand me. If so please replace your friend her that doing her best imitating a statue.”

After a few seconds of dead silence, one of the alien females pointed to the one on the floor, after a few hissed words they traded places and she started to put on the gloves. When she was done she nodded to John.

“All right, just to be clear. You lot can all understand me?” He looked at the younger alien females in turn. The elderly female winced in pain again trying to grab at her injury but stopping herself. “Right first contact protocol can wait, you.” John pointed at the new alien female sitting across from him. “I need you to hold her leg down as I clean it; it’s going to be somewhat painful.”

Working together John and the alien girl spent the next few minutes treating and dressing the wound, once finished  John sat back and started putting his bag back in order again.

Standing up he went over to the scattered remains of the ice-cream machine. “Right, let’s see if we can’t put Humpty Dumpty back in working order again,” John muttered to himself.

With a bit of a puzzled look on their faces, the alien females watched as John put the ice cream machine back together again. Once finished John walked over to one of the brewage coolers and grabbed one of the better ice tea drinks, grabbing a straw he headed to the back room again. Kneeling down next to the injured alien he took one of her arms in his hands trying to feel for a pulse. After a few seconds of feeling around her wrist, he moved higher up her arm, after falling that, he gently moved up to her neck. At which point there was a loud shout from one of the other aliens, standing up he went to the objective alien. John grabbed her hand and pressed two of her fingers onto his jugular vein, whit etch rhythmic beat of his heart she could feel the throbbing in his neck. After a moment he let go and knelt down next to the on the floor again.

“Here, if you’re anything like us you should probably drink something. I’m going to see what’s going on with your shuttle.” John offered her the bottle and stood up. He pointed to the one that had helped him treat the woman’s wound. “You stay.” He pointed to the other two. “You two whit me.” John headed out the front door with the alien females close behind him. Heading up the hill to his house he could still see the contours of the shuttle.

Retching the craft John banged on the hull next to the hatch and stuck his head inside the hatch, a strong smell of burning circuits met his nose. “All right, this might get interesting.” He muttered to himself as he entered the shuttle.

Sparks flew from the walls as he stepped inside, he made his way to the back of the craft finding the first woman he met frantically trying to put out a small electrical fire with a cloth. Turning around he headed outside and went to his garage entering inside he grabbed one of his fire extinguishers that used a powder rather than water or foam, as well as his electrical tool bag. Returning to the craft he dropped the bad outside the hatch and entered the craft readying the extinguisher.  Getting to where the young woman where still trying to put out the fire, John put a hand on the female's shoulder.

“Time to try something else, please move aside.”

In frustration the female moved aside, John grabbed the extinguisher from the floor, aimed the small hose, and gave it a good two-second puff of powder. The fire tried to re-ignite but the powder prevented it, John turned to the alien.

“Find the main power and turn it off, from what I can tell all your shuttle's power is trying to feed itself through this circuit.” After moments of hesitation, she turned to a big lever on the hull, and with some difficulty, she cut the power. “God, now let’s see if we can fix this rust bucket.”

Retrieving his toll bag John set to work trying to diagnose the half-burnt circuit, Opening as many inspection hatches as he could, half expecting a tangled mess of wires and circuit boards that looked like they had been put together by a committee of blind, monks. But instead, there were neatly guided power cables, all going to one single power distributor or the equivalent thereof.

John had to use all his restraint from doing the biggest face-palm in his life, but slowly and with a lot of colorful language towards the shuttles constructors he managed to repair and bypass most of the burnt circuitry. And a few hours later he indicated to the alien woman to put the power back online.

Half expecting his job to blow up in his face, John held his breath and was almost disappointed as the shuttle's engines hummed to life and started making a sound like a purring kitten.

“Try activating the cloak,” John told the Alien female.

A few seconds later, the sound of the craft changed, the hum of the engines shifting to a softer, more muted tone. ""Well, well, well, looks like someone actually knew what they were doing,"" he said, a soft smile on his lips as he started putting his electric tool bag back together again.

A moment later the first alien he met that night came out from the cockpit with a bewildered look on her face, a commotion at the hatch made John turn towards it. It was the rest of the aliens alongside the elderly injured one; John shut off the main power, grabbed a key component from one of the circuits. Exiting the craft under what he assumed was a protest, he hurried down to the gas station wrote a quick note to the owner, grabbed his medical bag cleared up any evidence of the encounter, and proceeded to lock up the station and hurried back up the hill. Entering his garage he grabbed a go bag from a shelf close to the door, locked the door, and proceeded to enter the shuttle again. Closing the small escape hatch he stood up.

“All right ladies, here’s the deal. The only way you get off this rock is if I’m going with you.” John reinstalled the component on the circuit board and pulled the power switch. “Now, shall we fly before someone notices that my house is gone?”

A sharp melodic command from the cockpit made the females act as one, they all entered the cockpit each one taking a seat. John took up a position inside the hatch to the cockpit. The ship vibrated under his feats as it took off gaining altitude and momentum. In mere seconds the stars became much more distinct, the shuttle made a course correction and moments later he saw what could only be the ISS. It was there for a fraction of a second.

“Talk about a kick in the pants” John mumbled to himself.

The hum of the engines switched pitch again and John felt himself getting pressed against the bulkhead, steadying himself John made his way to the back of the shuttle. Making himself a makeshift resting area, resting his head against the bulkhead he closed his eyes and listened to the hum of the engine. The hours crept by, they turned to days, but then he felt the engines starting to spool down. Taking up his spot inside the cockpit.

“Coming in a bit fast are we?” It wasn’t a question it was a statement.

The alien in the pilot seat nodded her head, working the console in front of her.

“So, come in ass first, might not be fancy or elegant, but at least you can slow down.” What a maneuver that almost made John relieve himself of his last protein bar, the female swung the shuttle around and gun the engine to full throttle.

A com channel crackled to life and one of the other females replied to it. Whit what could only be described as the most graceful reversed landing ever in the history of the fleet, the shuttle made a twenty-meter-long skid mark in the deck as she slammed onto the hangar bay floor and ground to a final halt.

Without hesitation, John lunged for the main power switch and pulled the lever hard. The shuttle's engines died, plunging the ship into darkness. John fumbled his way through the darkness, finding the escape hatch he slowly opened it. But before he could open it fully someone yanked it fully open stuck its head inside, saw John, and pulled back just as quickly.

John moved to the cockpit and stuck his head inside. “Ladies, I think one of you needs to tell your friends out there I’m unarmed and quite friendly when guns aren’t pointed at me.”

The female closest to the exit stood up and motioned for John to move, stepping aside the alien female went to the hatch and spoke a few words in their melodic tone. A reply came almost immediately after which the female stepped through the hatch, instead of following her John went to the cockpit and knelt next to the injured woman.

“Are you ok to walk or do you need assistance?” Standing up the female immediately lost her balance, John caught her with steady hands. “Well, it was worth a try, ok lean your back against me. You pilot Grab her pants on her uninjured leg and lift. ” John looked at one of the other Females. “You, gently raise her injured leg and let it rest above the god one.” Looking at the Pilot. “Now just follow along, if you get tired have one of the others relieve you.” As John backed up the pilot and the other two followed him out to the main area of the shuttle.

“Ok you two, out the hatch and grab her leg as we hand her over. The hatch is too small for us to carry her out like this.” The two alien females looked at the injured one for a moment then turned and exited the craft. John decided to send her out legs first and luckily the handover went smoothly.",1,1736930280.0,u_SwedDrPlastic,0,1.0,False

Now, I cant be alone in this, am I? I am doing everything right. My pouring is top notch, I mix my water for ideal TDS and mineral ratios, I use a ZP6 & JE for grinding, I do up to date puck prep for espresso (tumble, press), I measure everything, I am as precise and geeky as can be.

HOWEVER, in the odd 3 years that I have been into specialty coffee, I find that aroma is the strongest predictor of flavour quality. If the coffee smeels intense and tasty, It always tastes great once I find the recipe. If it smells like, well, not much of anything at all, it also tastes like that. 

I have to try REAAAAALLY hard to catch the notes on some of these expensive competition coffees, and the flavour intensity, clarity and separation is clear to be low from the second I grind it up and the smell is barely distinctive. Other coffees, even before I open the coffee, I can smell already that this one is going to be amazing. 

And this is not tied to cultivar, region or even processing. I have had washed coffees from nicaragua blow me away with an intense strawberry aroma and flavour, while triple fermented colombian pink bourbons have tasted like hay to me. 

The issue here is, when I taste it with some of my coffee snob friends, they really like the flat tasting, hay-ish competition coffees, and immidiately start ranting about the nuanced flavours. I mean sure, if I try hard enough, I can pick up some dark chocolate or cranberry, but hell, some coffees literally taste like chocolate, like you would actually be mistaken thinking you are drinking chocolate if blindfolded. 

And this most often happens with really expensive coffees, like $300/kg stuff. And like, I dont get it, once some people taste the really aromatic, clearly defined stuff, how is it that they still come back for the ""nuanced"" coffees, and act as if they were this intense experience, even though they really do taste the same to me and all of my laic friends.

 Its like eating walnuts, like sure, one tastes more like strawberry than another, Im sure, but you can also literally eat strawberries which do taste like strawberry every time.

One night, i was on my way home, i got home and parked into my usual parking spot, went inside my apartment and went about my night. Come Morning, i woke up got ready for work and headed out to my car only to find out that both the driver and passenger rear view mirrors were busted as well as one of my window wiper arms, the total damage i have been quoted was $500-$800 USD.

I'm at the point where even apples or pears are irritating it. 

For me I've always had an issue with sugar. 
When I was in my 20s used to make my bottom itch,  penis sore... And in my 30s lots of all over body rashes.
Some all over my body especially after having surgery...I suspect antibiotics.
Soon as I cut back in refined sugars... This went away. 

If I eat more sugar I get the rashes back on my arms and athletes foot back, bottom itches, penis sore ect. 

Now in my 40s it's the bladder that really feels it. It gets pissed off. Frequent peeing and painful voiding of urine and burning feeling. Also makes my Anklosing Spondylitis worse. And this is just fruit. I'm not talking about chocolate or jam or sugar. 

My last biggest flare started in November when it was my birthday. I did let myself go. Had a few coffees, ate cakes ate biscuits... Then a few weeks later... Bladder goes nuts. This time it won't tolerate meds I've been taking for years... Just makes the bladder hurt like hell. 
And it's just really painful. 
I've lost 13 lbs in weight where I feel ill and terrified to eat certain things. 

I think my bladder isn't even allowing me to drink caro, a chicory barley fully caffeine free drink. 

I know about candia. And I've been on allot of antibiotics in my life... Many not by choice as been ill or surgery. 

Although my very experienced urologist has diagnosed me with pelvic floor dysfunction (after years of being misdiagnosed) I'm still going to see a pelvic floor physio to actually examine me... As the urologist went on past tests and symptoms.

I can get behind the diagnosis of PFD but always stunned how the bladder is effected but food, drink and meds. My bladder must horrendously irritated and sore too react so badly too even very mild foods.

1i1sy1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1i1sy1h/letter_to_my_ex/,Letter to my ex ,"I just want to start out by saying that I know that I made the right decision to continue to try to work on things with you and fight for you for the last 3 months against my better judgement because if I hadn’t done that I wouldn’t have been doing our relationship justice. I valued you and our relationship and even after you gave up on us and had made up your mind I was buying you flowers and bringing you coffee and making plans to go hangout with our friends who LOVED YOU and us and had real hopes for us and envied the love we had. I drove you and your friends to a Halloween party and you literally were telling people you were going to leave me while I sat on the couch not knowing. I drove us home and crawled into bed with you and held you that night. I pushed my fear down because you said everything was ok,  you put on a mask and acted fake. I honestly believed you would have spoken with me before deciding to break up the moment your sibling left by the way you kissed me in bed that weekend, and by the way you had planned that 5k and how we had joked about the next one we’d do together in the car after. I wore our matching shirts from the previous 5k and looked forward to supporting you, even though I didn’t run. On that Sunday, I sat at the brewery with (sibling) and they told me how cute we were and I told them I loved you more than anything. I have been told countless times by people that they wanted a love like ours. I was so comfortable with you and you completely broke my heart. I was honest when I told you I thought of growing old with you, how your face with change with age and how I would love you even more as our love also changed. You told me you wanted my last name and left me. I told you I loved you more everyday and I meant it. When I gave you that rose that weekend it was because even though we were just running errands so I could make dinner for your family I saw it as an opportunity to make you feel appreciated and wanted to make it special for us because that entire weekend had been been filled with pictures with your family, dinners with your family and we hadn’t had a lot of time to focus on loving each other. After dinner I swooned over you and talked about my mug you got me and how you made me feel accepted and safe. I deserve for someone to see my love and fight for me the same way I did for you. You came in with your mind made up and then left. After the dust settles and you look back you will remember times like your birthday when literally none of your selfish friends danced with you, prioritized you or wished you a happy birthday. You cried to me on your birthday this year and told me you wanted to go somewhere with me for your 27th. How (friend) was with (boyfriend) all night and didn’t pay attention to you. You told me that. I promised you we would do whatever you wanted and we played pinball that night and I thought we had a great time. I also would like you to reflect on the fact that you are not only losing out on me but you’re also losing my mom’s love and support. She honestly considered you her daughter. Her love for you was an extension of mine. She believed you when you told her you thought of me as the “best person you knew” and she was going to fight hard for us to move anywhere and do anything we wanted together because she knew how in love with you I was. They were going to split rent with us so we could move anywhere we wanted. My entire family knew I was planning to propose to you and they were all shocked when I told them you left me. You got a new job and left as soon as you could afford your own rent and that is so gross. My family supported you and literally paid your way while you were doing your certification and school. You abandoned them the same way you abandoned me. I also would like you to know even when you came home on Monday (my friend) was telling me about how I had to take you to Amsterdam. Even as you were walking through the door that afternoon I was still planning for our future, I sat there on my computer as you told me we needed to talk. I was looking up plane tickets. I look back at our relationship and I remember so many great times with you and although it wasn’t perfect and I had made mistakes I was determined to make them up to you and fix things. I felt so safe with you and I was so wrong. I really don’t think you understand what you left behind. You told me you feel guilty for leaving me but I think you actually just feel regret. That’s why you kept coming over drunk, spending the night.  That’s why you made love to me. You love me and I made you feel safe. I was literally giving your nieces piggy back rides around the yard and telling them I’d be there for the next family event. I was going to work through ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. I hope the next person you date is willing to do that. I hope you go to therapy. I hope you stop doing coke. I hope you find better friends. I think you were encouraged by people who don’t really know us, our relationship or care about your long term happiness or safety and are in horribly unsatisfactory relationships themselves. Or aren’t in relationships at all. You were my best friend and you treated me like shit though this breakup. I ate you out and you got up, put your pants on and told me you wanted the apartment. I hope tonight when you are laying in bed you think about the last time we made love or our last time cuddling in bed and it torments you the way I have felt tormented by it. On that Friday you were sending your friend a message about how you were planning on breaking up with me, you were texting me at the same fucking time telling me that you were “getting through the day thinking about me.” What a joke. I’m now left questioning if anything you ever said you felt for me was real. I saw you as my life partner and I was so crazy about you. You can delete pictures of me but you’ll never rid yourself of memories of us or guilt for what you did. I hope you enjoy hookup culture. I hope you enjoy starting over with someone else. You’ll go on bad dates and think back to what we had. You’ll remember how I wanted you and how I wanted to be with you forever and how you gave that up. I hope you feel happy alone in your new apartment. All of your bad excuses like our rings or the fact that I said I wasn’t ready for kids is such bullshit. You know I wanted to be with you. I constantly asked why you weren’t wearing your ring. I would tap them together when we were wearing them. We always talked about our future and IVF and I never said once that I didn’t want you. When you broke up with me you saw my heart break, I chased you out to your car and told you I didn’t want it to end. I consistently sent you cute messages for weeks after you left. You just keep telling yourself whatever you need to so you can justify walking out on someone who truly loved you.",1,1736929289.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

When I was 8 years old, I had a best friend named Max. We spent every single day together, playing video games, riding bikes, and getting into trouble around the neighborhood. But one day, Max moved away with his family, and like many childhood friendships, we slowly drifted apart. I tried looking for him a few times over the years, but we never reconnected.

Fast forward to about five years ago, I was working at a small local coffee shop during my college days. One afternoon, a guy came in for a cup of coffee, and I couldn’t help but stare at him. There was something oddly familiar about him, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. He was a little older, a bit rough around the edges, but he had this smile that seemed almost too nostalgic.

I asked if I could help him, and after a moment of hesitation, he looked at me and said, “Do you remember me? It’s Max.”

My jaw dropped. It was him. After all those years, there he was, standing in front of me like time hadn’t passed. We both just stood there in silence for a few seconds, then burst out laughing. We spent the next couple of hours talking and catching up over coffee. Turns out, he had moved back to town recently, and he’d been coming to the shop regularly, not realizing I worked there.

It’s been over a year since then, and Max and I have been picking up where we left off, like no time had passed at all. We still joke about how crazy it was that we bumped into each other that day—out of all the coffee shops in the world, I worked in the one he came to. I guess sometimes the universe just has a funny way of bringing people back together.
