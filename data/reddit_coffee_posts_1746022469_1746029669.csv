Part time weekend girl and me full time weekdays (approximately 60 hours) and one person who occasionally does the closing and helps during the day. 

I am almost all the time on my feet. I didnt have a problem at first but my knees started hurt way too much. I got support pads to wear them on my 12 hour shifts but what else can I do? 

My eating habits are really really bad. During the shift I dont have time to eat so I just snack on sugary things. When I go home mostly I eat carbs and not enough protein. 

Any suggestions?",1,1746029543.0,barista,0,1.0,False

I am in charge of getting myself ready for work, my daughter ready for daycare, and prepping dinner for my husband to make when he gets home. Most days I'm just robotically moving through the tasks to make sure I don't forget anything because I'm too tired to think. 

This morning while I'm scrambling to get everything done, my two year old comes over to me with her two teacups and spoons and goes ""coffee mommy sit down."" She has never done that before. 

I went to say we didn't have time but I saw the biggest smile on her face I'd ever seen. So I sat down and for 90 seconds we just giggled having pretend coffee without a care in the world. Then we quickly finished getting ready and ran out the door. 

Sitting here eating lunch at work and finally having a moment to reflect, I am so glad I did that. I don't know if it will be a core memory for her, but I know it will be for me. ",1,1746029423.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False
1kbkbj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1kbkbj1/need_help_with_light_sleeper/,Need help with light sleeper,"I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do about this situation anymore. My roommate and I are living in a 2 bedroom older house. The problem is that I have to work 12-hour night shifts, where sometimes I stay up late so switching back to nights is easier (to 3 AM) or the whole night if I have a day off in the middle of my stretch. 

My roommate is an incredibly light sleeper. She‚Äôs yelled at me multiple times for waking her up due to ‚Äústomping‚Äù, ‚Äúshoving things‚Äù or ‚Äúslamming things‚Äù. I genuinely have done any of those above. I don‚Äôt play music or watch TV without headphones, do dishes, etc. The most I do is sit on the couch in the living room, and even then I lay out all my things I need for the night beforehand so I‚Äôm not walking around. The most walking I ever do is to the bathroom. I also have 0 limitations for what she does when I am sleeping during the day. 

I also sometimes come home at around 12:30 AM when I have the night off as I‚Äôm hanging out with friends at their places or at coffee shops. The most I do when I come back is to walk two feet to the couch, which has anything I need overnight already laid out on it to minimize noise. 

My bedroom is the smallest one in the house, which is why I hang out in the living room when I‚Äôm not sleeping during the night. I also have another room upstairs, but she has requested me not to use it as walking around upstairs wakes her up as well. Her room is much larger, but she refuses to switch because she doesn‚Äôt want to spend time separated from her dog (he can‚Äôt climb the stairs). 

Despite all my best efforts, she still is waking up from me during the night. I have offered her earplugs and a white noise machine but she has declined both and sleeps with at most an audiobook. She also yells at me that I‚Äôm violating quiet hours, but from my perspective the most sound I‚Äôm making is walking to/from the bathroom or brushing my teeth to get ready for bed (as quietly as I can). Even when I go straight to bed after coming back at 12:30 she says I‚Äôm waking her up. I‚Äôm also not doing anything different during the night than she does when I am sleeping during the day. If anything, I am doing less as she often comes in and out of the house to walk her dog. ",1,1746029413.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

1kbka9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1kbka9a/she_abused_me_but_i_cant_let_her_go/,She abused me but I can't let her go,"Storytime. Summer of 2023 I meet a girl who went hiking on our local mountain as I was out training on my bike. She was a friend's friend and we just so happened to be in the same place at the same time. I like what I see and tell my friend to set up a hangout.

We go out, get hammered, have a lot of fun talking and acting stupid, I felt an instant connection. I hit her up the next day apologizing for the wild immaturity and we go out for drinks and ""grown up talk"". Things go smoothly but I don't make a move, I wait until later that week and invite her to go see a play that the university student theatre group was putting up.

We go to the play, have a lot of fun and end up at the terrace of the dorms I lived in looking at the stars. We hang out all night together and get frisky. Things just went off from there. We were both laid back, her never having had a serious relationship and leaving for Erasmus in October for 4 months, me having gotten out of a 5 year relationship 5 months prior.

But it was electric. She was so different to any girl I had dated previously. I clearly had a type up until then: the quiet, shy, in-her-shell type of girl who I'd just inadvertently trample or ""manipulate"" so to speak with my loud, outgoing personality. But her? She was a pocket-sized atom bomb. Opinionated, extremely blunt, really chill and laid back, weirdly comfortably sexual despite having grown up sorta prudish. I know this might sound sexist but I felt like I was dating a dude in many respects. She definitely did not fit in the traditional gender roles I was used to. I was in a trance.

Early on she showed signs however of that prudish upbringing. She came from money. I was a deadbeat student basically working minimum wage bullshit jobs to support my sporting activities. And while she knew all of that and was attracted to me she'd still bring it up on occasion in kind of a nasty way. She'd put me down for it, pushing and pulling, liking the ""bad boy"" who was so different to the archetype she'd been raised to search for in  a man yet still deep down viewing him(me) as a ""lesser caste"".

Things came to a head before she left in October. She said something really hurtful and I broke it off. It didn't last. We kept in touch and basically kept talking all the time. Our connection deepened despite being long distance. Eventually we moved on to I love yous but just as that happened she completely pulled the rug under me by saying that she felt she was missing out on sexual experiences and couldn't enjoy her Erasmus properly. I was her first sexual partner and she was really freaky. She'd even get mad when I was too tired from training and working at the bakery to actually have sex.

I was devastated. I had after a long time and a big heartbreak from my previous relationships just only managed to fall in love again with a person that clicked so massively for me, that truly made me feel comfortable in my skin and my character. And let me tell you I loved our connection. I mean truly addicting stuff, our deep conversations about ourselves, our musings on reality, our shared love of 80s nostalgia, our constant cursing like truck drivers. It just felt right. So I was shocked. In order to not lose her I asked what she wanted to do. She basically asked for an open relationship to which I very reluctantly agreed. I was prepared to accept polygamy if that was the way to keep her emotionally with me.

Problem is I was the first to do it. I always viewed sex extremely casually, sort of a ""of course I'd like a slice of pizza"" thing. When I told her she freaked out completely. She said she'd grown very close to me and she had changed her mind on the arrangement (which she hadn't communicated beforehand). She was furious and wanted to break up. I used what little I had of my savings to instantly book a flight to go find her and beg her to properly get together in a monogamous relationship.

Things worked out, we had a lovely week together and then 2 months later she came back to our home country and our relationship proper started. It was idyllic. We were having so much fun, it was the first time I had ever felt this close this fast to someone, this truly fascinated with someone. She excited me on a fundamental level, I was so comfortable. The perfect amount of childish naivete and playfulness, sexual tension and ferocity, cutsie talk and truck driver language.

Then after 3 months (almost a year in our journey) she started to change. She was finishing up her degree and was about to face massive changes. She was extremely anxious and what started as a sort of mild depression turned to outright vengefulness and emotional abuse. She would constantly refer to her best friend from Erasmus saying how attracted she was to him and how much she wanted to get with him back then and what a lost opportunity it was. She would make really bad scenes when I hang out with my friend group which had a few girls in it. It got to a point where I hadn't hung out with them in 2 months iirc.

Things got really bad late June last year when one night we were having dinner with her family and out of the blue she outed me for having cheated in previous relationships, a thing I was upfront with her early on and which I'd gone through years of therapy for (never gave her any reason to think I was unfaithful towards her, I literally mathematically couldn't be, I was either working, training or with her for several months). She outed me right in front of her family, calling people who cheat pieces of shit who never change. I was flabbergasted. I asked her ""why are you with me then if you believe these things about me?"" and she just shot off ""I don't know, why am I?"" in an infuriated tone.

So after months of her making scenes, driving me away from my friend group, making me jealous (which I never showed other than crying once and asking her to please stop referencing her friend so bluntly) and putting me down existentially as a lesser class of person I just broke up with her.

And I can't get over her. I truly felt great hope for our relationship. I felt a very deep and unique connection to her. The Highs were extremely high. We went back and forth for a few months, navigating through periods of talking or not talking. I went into a minor depressive state late 2024 after she came into my life again for about a month where she basically booty-called me for a few weeks and then we slowly rekindled a sort of romance but she again pulled out the rug from under me one day by making a massive jealousy scene with my friend group again when I was basically begging her by that point to get back together. Worse thing is the second night we hang out after the first booty call, we were casually hanging out with our mutual friend and she straight up said she'd fucked her Erasmus friend after we broke up. I was speechless. Broken. An empty shell. She'd put me through hell for months making me jealous on purpose and she just spouted that off. She even admitted to saying it on purpose as a sort of revenge. She cried and apologized. That shit gave me PTSD, I would black out during completely random moments even when talking to other people and be overcome with images of that situation. It was hellish.

I really don't know why, this person got me fucked up. I just can't get over her. We're not talking now, after the incident late 2024 I cut off all communication for 4 months until recently when we met up for coffee but she was distant. So I shot off an email and we said some sweet things about each other and decided to just completely cut off communication. But man, it hurts...",2,1746029318.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False
1kbk9xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1kbk9xw/alcoholism_is_not_a_disease/,Alcoholism is not a disease,"I don‚Äôt see how drinking alcohol all day qualifies as a disease. To me, it seems more like a result of having too much free time and consistently making bad decisions.

Take coffee, for example. I drink it every morning because it helps me feel more alert and focused, and its benefits far outweigh any drawbacks. Still, I wouldn‚Äôt call myself addicted to it. Coffee, like food and water, has actual benefits for the body‚Äîimproving cognitive function, boosting metabolism, and providing antioxidants. It serves a purpose beyond just getting a buzz.

Yet people who drink daily often label themselves as ‚Äúaddicts,‚Äù claiming their relationship with alcohol is similar to how others feel about coffee. But alcohol isn‚Äôt beneficial‚Äîit‚Äôs not something the body needs or gains from. It‚Äôs a social or recreational indulgence, not a necessity.

Calling alcoholism a ‚Äúdisease‚Äù puts it in the same category as cancer or ALS‚Äîactual diseases that strike people without their consent, without them making daily conscious choices to invite it in. No one chooses cancer. No one develops ALS because they repeatedly decided to indulge in something harmful while pretending they had no control. That comparison is an insult to people truly battling real diseases.

So, if someone chooses to drink every single day, that says more about their judgment than it does about some so-called disease. Enough with the victim narrative. Saying things like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my personality‚ÄîI‚Äôm just addictive by nature, so I have to avoid alcohol!‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a personal choice. Let‚Äôs be honest about that.

A little bit of background information on Kendu: We are currently on 3 chains(Ethereum, Solana and Base) with ETH being our native chain, we have around 18k holders and sit at 12 million market cap, we have an very hardworking community, we are top 5 memecoins in terms of social media effort with Certik rating our community 98/100 and a IRL presence that is unprecedented, I am not gonna PvP other coins but I haven't found a coin with a Certik community score even close to Kendu's(you can check it out for yourself at the bottom of this page). Btw some background information on the Certik Score, Kendu and 1 other coin has reached 50k Certik votes to gain the free audit, this coin was Pepe. Yes the Pepe that reached 10 billion in a bear market, this is around a 1000x from Kendu's current levels, but it must be nothing...

Founded by a former Triple-A game designer alongside three other developers, including a seasoned programmer from another major studio, this is not a crypto game, but some profits will be used to buy Kendu.

He has been a long time Kendu Chad and I couldn't help but include it since it was very recent

  
**Why Do People Go On About Community and Why Does It Matter**

It has been proven time and time again that community is what defines the value of a memecoin. All Shib, Doge, Pepe had was a community. Community is all that matters and thats why I am so bullish on Kendu, if you have been watching the memecoin space you would have saw that Kendu is everywhere and is constantly raiding, making posts and just showing our strength in general. To me it is pretty clear to see that Kendu is going to the top, no one is currently on our level in terms of community strength across both social media and IRL.

This is entirely my opinion, but I do not see a single possibility where Kendu is under 10 billion market cap at the end of this cycle, Shib managed 44 billion when there was less money invested in crypto and with far less understanding of the potential of a memecoin. Pepe managed 10 billion outside of a bull run.......   
If they can manage the tens of billions, then so can Kendu, we have a community who is just as strong as theirs in the biggest bull run ever!!!! 

Retail will love IRL initiatives since it gives a memecoin some substance and reliability, so Kendu is in an incredible position to benefit greatly when retail arrives, you want to hold Kendu before this, as we will move very fast!

My advice to you would be to at least get in our telegram, you don't have to buy anything it is completely free, you can compare our activity to other communities or ask questions. I guarantee that you will be impressed. 

All the signs are there

Context. I'm 36M, and had an event at my climbing gym last night. I just got a fresh haircut that morning so I was feeling GOOD. The gym hired a DJ for the event, who happened to be a really cute girl. She was keeping the vibes high with really good music, and I was one of the only people actively dancing throughout the gym. We made eye contact and smiled a couple times throughout the night, and so towards the end I approached her and chatted with her for a bit. 

It was light, fun, and casual. Great, in my opinion. She's also a climber, and obviously is really into music, and blah blah blah. At the end of the conversation I was very direct and said ""I'll be honest - I think you're really cute, you're a great DJ, and I'd love to buy a coffee for you sometime. Would you be okay if I gave you my number?"" 

She seemed incredibly flattered, basically blushing. She was smiling and I think was just taken by surprise or something. She then politely told me she had a boyfriend, after which I smiled and said ""no worries, I thought I would ask! Thanks for keeping the vibes high! You're great!"" and she was grateful, and then I left.


I'm happy that I went up to talk to her. I don't typically approach women, especially when they're in the middle of things. I'm not bummed that she has a boyfriend, but I cannot shake this feeling of hopelessness. Everyone I meet is either partnered up, or about to get married. My partnered friends are all aware of my situation, and they even try to look out for me at times. It almost feels like they're entertained by my struggle to find companionship. It hurts. I often get overwhelmed by the sense that society has left me by the wayside. Like because I didn't choose to get married in my college years, that I no longer even have the option to find someone.


I'm in therapy, and I exercise often, and I'm very social. I don't know if it's a just a string of bad luck, or what. I don't really have much success on the apps, and I try not to spend too much time on them anyways. I'm just venting right now I suppose. Thanks for reading.",4,1746028971.0,dating,3,1.0,False

1kbk30n,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1kbk30n/lack_of_customer_service_in_nonchain_cafes/,Lack of Customer Service in Non-Chain Cafes,"Hello all. I have worked at Starbucks for a few years, but when it comes to getting coffee outside of work, I either make it myself at home with specialty beans or I find a local cafe/roastery where I can get some good coffee. I live in a city that is known for its coffee, and I like to explore around, find places I've not visited before, and try to learn about the coffees they offer and maybe find a new coffee to bring home with me.

I've found lots of places with very good coffee, but what I've found sorely lacking at nearly every non-chain cafe I've visited is customer service. I've never been welcomed in at any non-chain cafes, have rarely found much in the way of a warm, welcoming atmosphere being created by the baristas, have found baristas typically not very interested in talking about the coffee they brew or sell, and in many cases have felt a sense that the baristas really could not care less about me as a customer. I've also found that store cleanliness is typically not that great and there just didn't seem to be much care put into the customer experience after the drink is handed off. This was even true in cafes that seem to brand themselves as being more high-end and that had higher prices for their drinks.

Visiting Starbucks of course one's mileage will vary, different stores are better or worse at all of this, but I pretty consistently have a much better experiences in regard to all of these points at Starbucks, whether they know I'm a partner or not. So I'm just curious from the perspective of those of you who work in non-chain cafes where this would be coming from? Is customer connection something that is not emphasized in how baristas are trained outside of Starbucks and similar cafes? Is it a different model you guys are working on? I'm genuinely curious where this difference in experience comes from.",2,1746028838.0,barista,1,0.75,False

Nobody buys the Nespresso to save money. It‚Äôs not designed for that reason. It‚Äôs designed for convenience and being a time saver. Plus the coffee is great. When you think about the amount of time, it takes to go to Starbucks, stand in line to place an order, and wait to be called when your drink is ready I could do all that at home without any of the hassle.

But the reality of dating as an adult man is that your financial status, job, and your ability to cultivate resources are very important.

I feel like after your mid 20s, the reality of relationships is that they're less about your personality and more about your income, career, how much money you put into your 401k, etc. And again, I'm not *mad* at this reality, I just acknowledge it. I totally get it, life is expensive, especially in this economy, and you need someone who's going to help you live comfortably and put food on the table.  
Still though, it seems like at this age, dates basically become job interviews. Honestly, I'd even say looks aren't that important as you get older, being 6'3 and with a strong jawline doesn't mean jackshit if you're barista who drives 20 year old toyota corolla.

It sort of depresses me because I feel like I missed the boat where dating is fun, where it's just about meeting people and trying new things, where you don't get ghosted because you suggested coffee or a walk in the park as a first date because that must mean you're broke. This shouldn't even be a controversial take because plenty of other people on reddit express their frustration with how dating after your early 20s feels a lot like a job interview.

1kbjxaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kbjxaw/the_weight_of_ashes/,The Weight of Ashes,"# Chapter 1: The Man Who Almost Healed

Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her‚Äîfumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna‚Äôs passing, the twins had been born‚Äîtiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday‚ÄîEmma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then‚Äîsilence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.



# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it‚Äîcruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel‚Äôs alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn‚Äôt bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn‚Äôt drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of ‚Äústages,‚Äù ‚Äúhealing,‚Äù ‚Äúcoping,‚Äù while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog‚Äîa golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was ‚Äúgood with kids.‚Äù Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn‚Äôt ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile‚Äîas if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors‚Äîbackpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper‚Äîquiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons‚Äîa plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye‚Äîplastered with ‚ÄúProud Parent‚Äù stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later‚Äîcursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car‚ÄîRobert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn‚Äôt fix anything. It didn‚Äôt bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest‚Äîjust enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.



# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn‚Äôt enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, borrowed thing‚Äîone that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically‚Äîhis grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill‚Äîfast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn‚Äôt stop. The child‚Äôs face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn‚Äôt move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert‚Äôs jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn‚Äôt learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine‚Äîbut not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still‚Äînot enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don‚Äôt remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy‚Äîmaybe six‚Äîslipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother‚Äôs scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn‚Äôt the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn‚Äôt stop.



# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water‚Äôs edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened‚Äîthe gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back‚Äîa touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet‚Äîparents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn‚Äôt stop. He didn‚Äôt look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma‚Äôs crib and Samuel‚Äôs racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn‚Äôt contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.



# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy‚Äôs body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other‚Äôs eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn‚Äôt last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned‚Äîcautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn‚Äôt stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall‚ÄîMiller Park‚Äîunder the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn‚Äôt feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party‚Äîballoons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise‚Äîjust another utility worker. He didn‚Äôt need threats or blackmail this time. He didn‚Äôt need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma‚Äôs old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn‚Äôt shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now‚Äînot because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn‚Äôt yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck‚Äîwhite flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other‚Äôs arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it‚Äîlooped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child‚Äôs name‚ÄîEli Meyers‚Äîsuddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: ‚ÄúHe looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.‚Äù

Then a new tab opened‚Äîher niece‚Äôs photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: ‚ÄúShe still likes hide-and-seek, right?‚Äù

Linda‚Äôs hands hovered over the keys. She didn‚Äôt call anyone. She didn‚Äôt say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week‚Äîsecondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

‚ÄúSabotage.‚Äù

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn‚Äôt make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn‚Äôt need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it‚Ä¶ they were just getting started.

  


# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren‚Äôt mourning Robert‚Äôs children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn‚Äôt enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song‚Äî""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn‚Äôt special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn‚Äôt scream. He didn‚Äôt run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely‚Äîbut deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy‚Äôs brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy‚Äôs mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him‚Äîsomething fragile and bright‚Äîhad been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn‚Äôt light a cigarette. Didn‚Äôt open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn‚Äôt revenge anymore. It wasn‚Äôt even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports‚Äîall of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn‚Äôt have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I‚Äôm coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

  


# Chapter 7: The Spider‚Äôs Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it‚Äîand maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins‚Äîevents that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn‚Äôt yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there‚Äîmapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don‚Äôt want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn‚Äôt just violence. This was love‚Äîtwisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn‚Äôt a phone number. It wasn‚Äôt coordinates. It wasn‚Äôt a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced‚Äîsimple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel‚Äôs Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria‚Äôs pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds‚Äîone tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria‚Äôs throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it‚Äî A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself‚Äîphotographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn‚Äôt been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

  


# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them‚Äîno bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph‚ÄîEmma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo‚Äôs yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn‚Äôt look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel‚Äôs face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion‚Äînot anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn‚Äôt happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn‚Äôt forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert‚Äôs lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children‚Äîtheir heads drooping in the cold‚Äîand then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then‚Äîslowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn‚Äôt acted alone.

And Halston‚Äôs nightmare was far from over.

  


# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond‚Äôs edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl‚Äôs body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still‚Äîthe dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn‚Äôt about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn‚Äôt trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn‚Äôt meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn‚Äôt want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox‚Äîthe bus driver‚Äîtook the longest. He didn‚Äôt speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn‚Äôt need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn‚Äôt needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed‚Äîsmall acts, each just a hair‚Äôs breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren‚Äôt.

At the center of the new web wasn‚Äôt a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.



# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone‚Äîa hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn‚Äôt recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now‚Äîtyped, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We‚Äôre still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn‚Äôt she?"" ""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now‚Äîsomething familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn‚Äôt needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it ‚Äúlooked wrong.‚Äù Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria‚Äôs front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",3,1746028433.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

This game could see runs for days, friends. Cal Quantrill (7.83 ERA) has been brutal so far this season, allowing a staggering 32 hits and 9 walks in just 23 innings. I won‚Äôt be surprised if the Los Angeles offense cracks this total all by themselves (again...). Though, Dodgers starter Tony Gonsolin returns to the lineup today after not playing in ages. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôll get off to a bad start, but I think it‚Äôs fair to assume there might be some rust to shake off and the Marlins will put a few on the board. In any case, I‚Äôm whole-heartedly on the Over to cash here, betting fam.

I don‚Äôt have any experience in educational teaching. I am open to getting a masters however, I would like to try and get some experience to see if I like teaching first. 

I‚Äôve been working in higher education admin for about 2 years now. Before that, I worked at a coffee shops for 4 years as a shift supervisor managing/training teenagers and college students. 

I‚Äôve been told by many people, that I should go into teaching. I‚Äôm patient, empathetic, enjoying helping others, selfless, there for others, and kind! One of my favorite aspects of my job as a supervisor was watching my baristas grow and learn as people and in their job! When I was a child, I used to pretend I was a teacher by making up worksheets for my younger sister to do or write things on a dry erase board lol, she never wanted to participate. My mom was a college professor and my grandma was a teacher and school principal. I kinda grew up around education if that makes sense! 

I don‚Äôt have any experience teaching, but I‚Äôm beginning to think I will have more fulfillment going that route. I know going into teaching may not be the best avenue right now with the state of our country. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can get experience teaching? I was thinking even camp counselor or something but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm too old lol. I‚Äôll be 30 in June.

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm 23M and recently had my first ever real date  with a 30F I met online. I know there‚Äôs an age gap, and I know I‚Äôm still figuring things out, but honestly‚Ä¶ that first date was the best day I‚Äôve had in years.

We spent about 5 hours together. Got coffee, walked, had ice cream, then drinks and a snack. She complimented me, opened up, we talked about family, life, culture ‚Äî all of it. I was nervous but I stayed present and respectful, and I could feel there was a connection.

At the end of the night she hinted at inviting me in, but I held back. Not because I wasn‚Äôt into her (I definitely was), but because I‚Äôm inexperienced and didn‚Äôt want to rush or make a mistake. She still messaged me after, sent hearts, and we planned a second date. I had a small accident at the worst time possible and had to postpone   and she  responded positively.

But now I‚Äôm kinda scared. Not about sex exactly  though that‚Äôs part of it. I‚Äôm a virgin, and I have insecurities about my body even though I‚Äôm tall, fit, and kinda athletic from. But the bigger fear is emotional.

I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll ruin something that finally feels real. I don‚Äôt know how to show interest without overdoing it. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs too little or too much. I don‚Äôt want to be the clueless 23-year-old she grows tired of, or someone who seems unsure of what he wants. But I do want something real  and I think this could be it.

Any advice? Especially from women or older people who‚Äôve been on either side of a similar situation. How do I show interest in a way that feels mature but still true to where I‚Äôm at? And how do I stop letting anxiety about ‚Äúmessing it up‚Äù keep me from enjoying something good?

Thanks.

That are never really fixed in that department, and I really do not want to pay a quarter or half of what the grinder cost out the door I know it's an easy fix. So my question to you is my coffee. His just so inconsistent, I'm usually really good. With dialing in, is it possible? The key not being stable be causing my burrs to STOP moving and choke up, not move? I know when I turn it on.

1kbjr1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nomad/comments/1kbjr1m/where_to_move_to_professional_artist_looking_to/,Where to move to? Professional Artist looking to move abroad and get MFA,"TL/DR ; BFA and working as an artist, want to get my MFA and work teaching at Uni level along with my own art practice. Native American, woman, lgbtq, safe, progressive place with good underground art scene and body mod community, avante garde and weird. Nature and walkability, with good community/social culture and good food. 

The deets: 

I have a BA in fine arts and illustration, I'm native American (mom was Australian though) with a US partner as well. With the current state of the country I have been wanting to leave for a few years, especially because I live in a desert and I desperately need a place where it rains and its green and has a good experimental/avante garde art scene and underground scene. My partner works in property management and housing, with experience managing military housing and insurance, overseeing projects, he has an associates in economics and would like to get a Bachelors at some point.

I've considered Australia but it seems like it's boring and hard to make friends, and very capitalist and right leaning. I'm a bisexual woman and indigenous so that doesn't sound great. Although I visited as a kid (7 and 13) a couple times and loved the tropical vibe, the food and the beaches, also been to NZ and would love to be there but not sure they would want me. I also have family in the UK, two sisters and a brother/stepmom.

Specifics:

Work: would be an incoming student. My intention is to get my MFA and then teach at a uni level while also working independently as an artist in my own right. I don't trust art teachers that aren't working artists.

Environment/Travel: I would like walkability, I don't want to have to get a car, but I'd be fine riding a motorbike or a moped/bicycle around. I may need to rent a vehicle to transport art supplies but that's it. Plus if there's easy ways to travel farther like trains and such, here in America I love a road trip. Would prefer to live near an accessible beach or water, or just a good amount of nature.

I don't mind the cold, but long winters suck for my mental health and I am not used to dealing with tons of snow.

Visually, I would like a beautiful less industrial concrete jungle looking city to be in, or to even live in a semi rural area with easy access to a city.

Lifestyle: I'm an artist so I do spend time indoors, but that's also because I live in a desert city with not much nature available and I would love to get outside more.

Also would like affordable and good produce, and good food, diverse restaurant options. I love cooking and going out to eat.

I like to go to the movies, music shows, and comedy/poetry readings and such and obviously art galleries. I also love a good underground art scene, with really weird shit going on, I do flesh hook stuff and am into body mods, and performance art like Butoh and interpretive dance.

Politics: At least moderately progressive and safe enough for women, lgbtq and non-white/racially ambiguous people. I'm native and white, so people often mistake me for being Asian, I can't pass very well bc of my features even though my skin is lighter, plus if there is a decent punk/goth community.

Community: I'm big on knowing your neighbors and being active in your community. I want to wave at the old women on their porches and verandas and have coffee and meals with people.

I like social culture where it's easy to make friends. I know other countries generally hate Americans, but I don't come from the dominant western, arrogant and overly outgoing culture because I'm indigenous raised. I'm not obnoxious, and don't like to talk about myself unless asked. I'd rather learn about other people and culture and history.

Healthcare: I don't get sick often, but would prefer easily accessible mental health support, esp when it comes to accessing medication like stabilizers, and possibly regular therapy.

Affordability/income: Obviously we all want affordable housing, and a good paycheck. I don't mind working until I die if it's in education and the arts, or saving for retirement, that being said I would like to live somewhere that pays professors/academics well.

Education: It would be great if the place had schools that have English speaking programs to offer language support, and free or low cost tuition. Being in the arts in the Us does not offer many opportunities but I do currently work in k-12 education where I make 19-25$ an hour.

I have considered Berlin, but Norway would be too cold for me I think. I don't know if I would like the social culture in Germany either. ",1,1746028000.0,Nomad,0,1.0,False

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

The thing about my film program is that it seems bent on keeping you in the classroom instead of working on projects. And even when we do have projects, it‚Äôs things like doing a local news story or a commercial, and I probably won‚Äôt get the chance to work on an actual short film for an assignment until my last semester , which seems weird to me. I feel like it‚Äôs common knowledge that experience is the best teacher, yet this school seems so opposed to creating an environment where we can get meaningful experience that pertains to what we want to do.

On top of that, it‚Äôs kind of difficult for me to find friends to work on projects with outside of class assignments because I feel like there‚Äôs a gap in skill, experience, and passion between my classmates and I. I‚Äôm not trying to sound cocky or arrogant, but when we present our video assignment to the class, it‚Äôs clear that I have more experience than most other people in the class (I used to make YouTube videos in middle school and high school, so I‚Äòve known premiere pro for 5+ years and have basic knowledge of filming and lighting, whereas my classmates are mostly learning how to edit in this class). I just feel (and I‚Äôm really not trying to be insulting) that even if I were friends with my classmates, I wouldn‚Äôt really be able to rely on them for help. Not to mention the fact that half my class dropped out of it in the first half of the semester because they didn‚Äôt complete their beginner‚Äôs editing assignments and didn‚Äôt want to fail the class, I just feel like there‚Äôs not a lot of options for me to work on my own short films in or outside of class.

I‚Äôve applied to a pretty acclaimed university to attend next fall, but I don‚Äôt get my results back until mid-late June. The city I live in doesn‚Äôt have many opportunities for student filmmakers to get on sets because movies aren‚Äôt really filmed here (which may possibly change in the coming years, but I don‚Äôt know for sure if it will and I‚Äôd rather not sit around waiting to find out). I feel like going to this university is my only option now if I really want to do this because I may be able to meet peers who are just as passionate as me. I know film school isn‚Äôt necessary to be a filmmaker and there are plenty of filmmakers who haven‚Äôt gone to film school, but it seems like they often had a community of people who were also passionate about being in film, or lived in an area where there were opportunities to get on sets, neither of which I really have.

Overall I just feel lost and like I‚Äôm not making progress towards my goals. I really love film and would love to get a crappy PA job, even if it means grabbing coffee for the crew if it meant I would get to be on a set.

i just hit 6 months and as i go into step 5 i‚Äôm feeling really raw and fearful. i haven‚Äôt been going to many meetings and i really need to start showing up more and engaging with the fellowship because that‚Äôs what is missing from my recovery

recently, a guy in the rooms (he is older than me by probably 15 years) found me on Facebook. i am in my mid 20s and female. i think i mentioned where i work in a meeting once (i know thats on me) and so he stsrted coming to the cafe i work at daily for coffee. i didn‚Äôt think much of it because it‚Äôs a good coffee shop. but then he started attempting to message me on facebook about things we would casually chat about while i‚Äôd make his drink. i didn‚Äôt really reply.

he messaged me a few nights ago saying that he needed to talk to me about program related stuff.  this got a response out of me because i was worried he was in a bad place. i said ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù he said what he needed to talk to me about had to be in person. i replied that i was away and didn‚Äôt enjoy anticipation and he was welcome to talk to me in the facebook chat box. he replied that he needed to talk to me about something SPECIFICALLY regarding me and some things specifically regarding other members of AA. i replied that i am not willing to have this conversation alone in person and that if anyone is talking about me that isn‚Äôt my business anyway. he replied ‚Äúokay. i will probably still bring it up at my business meeting but will leave your name out‚Äù i replied that his approaching me like that made me very uncomfortable and to please leave me out of any perceived drama or personal business in the rooms. i blocked him. he has since been coming to the cafe still but instead of getting his coffee and leaving he sits for like, two hours and just kind of is an awkward presence. he doesn‚Äôt say hi or acknowledge me when he comes in so i feel really awkward and i feel like he is sitting for long periods of time with his big book to maybe purposely put me in an awkward position. however i don‚Äôt want to be too paranoid or make up stories in my head.

i feel really anxious about what it could have been because i try to stick with strong women and stay in my lane. i don‚Äôt talk to anyone for there to be a reason for this person to need to discuss others with me. i just made a goal to attend way more meetings but this person is at all of them and i just feel so weird.

am i making too big a deal out of this?

My therapist (can diagnose in my part of the US) simplied i'm developing something on the schizospectrum and like.. i've had increased issues for the past year but its been at a level that I'm not on meds, not hospitalized, ect and my therapist says i just have something developing early.

Honestly I think I'm just autistic or something and had some autism burnout which caused issues last year....

I didn't get assessed with autism cause, hey my parents didn't want something on my medical record like that.

Things that sound like autism: Sensory issues, i've been trying to get myself to actually do something by making a routine and its sort of been working this past week. (I've tried to do this multiple times and it always breaks down at the smallest disturbance). I do things that look like stimming/repetitive motions when stressed. I have some level of socialization issues. None of this is new. Sensory issues have gotten a bit better sometimes.

not sure wheres the line between needing routine with autism and just what most do. However it was to the point that I didn't really do any laundry or brush my teeth for a while and was just am wearing the same thing over and over. I've had familly suspect im autistic when i was younger as well. Also taking things too literally.

Things that made my therapist say Im developing/have some level of psychosis: occasionally i have a couple days where it all stops making sense. I keep sensing entities, sometimes I'm able to talk with them(mostly telepathically). I have a bunch of paranoia...mostly hidden cameras and i have various reasons why hey my familly likely is dosing me, messing with me to make me think im paranoid when im actually not that paranoid. The entities and everything aren't really negative. Possibly due to coffee, but i've had times where for a few days or a couple weeks I was just hyper to the point where I thought an entity wanted me to make a religion and then just it stopped but i feel calm now and still sense entities, paranoia, ect.

My grades got worse(but honestly maybe i just have autism and burnout although it coincided with the paranoia and spirituality pinging off). (And due to that, not studying enough, my foundations were very shakey in my pre-requisites.) I have diagnosed adhd and it felt like my adhd got alot worse...

It‚Äôs clear that Cuisinart aimed to take the nostalgia of percolated coffee and blend it with modern convenience. Stainless steel adds a sleek touch while the design caters to those who appreciate both form and function. After weeks of testing it daily, I‚Äôve grown a solid appreciation for its strengths, even as I encountered a couple of quirks.

**Timeless Design Meets Modern Functionality**  
The stainless steel construction definitely steals the show here, offering that classic yet modern vibe which blends seamlessly into any kitchen setup. Its compact dimensions (6.25""D x 9.25""W x 12.25""H) make it a welcome fit even on my overcrowded countertop. Plus, the transparent knob on top is more than just decorative; it allows you to watch the whole brewing process ‚Äì an oddly satisfying feature for coffee aficionados like me. The ergonomic handle ensures easy lifting, and that knuckle guard? It‚Äôs a small detail I didn‚Äôt expect to appreciate until my hand avoided accidental brushing against the hot surface.  

**Effortless Brewing Experience**  
This percolator is about as user-friendly as they come. There are measurement markings on the stainless steel basket, making it simple to gauge how much coffee to add depending on the size of the batch you plan to brew (ranging from 4 to 12 cups). Just add some grounds, pour in water, and let it work its charm. The manual operation might feel a bit nostalgic to traditionalists, but it‚Äôs straightforward enough to handle even if you‚Äôre used to pod-style machines.  

**Comfortable Pouring and Spout Design**  
One of my favorite features has to be the no-drip spout. I‚Äôve used coffee-making devices before where pouring felt like a hazardous event ‚Äì coffee sometimes spilling over the lid or the side. With this model, the long, tapered spout promised no drips, and surprisingly, it delivered. Pouring out that first cup in the morning with no spills or mess left me impressed by such a simple yet overlooked feature.  

**Check [Cuisinart PRC-12N] price on Amazon.**  

**Highlights**  
- The polished stainless steel exterior makes for easy cleaning while looking effortlessly stylish.  
- Transparent knob lets you watch the entire brew cycle unfold like a coffee ceremony.  
- A reusable filter eliminates the recurring cost of paper filters.  
- Comfort was prioritized with a sturdy handle and knuckle guard.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
This model does have a few minor issues, though none were deal-breakers.  

- Brewing takes a bit longer compared to pod-based systems which might frustrate someone in a hurry.  
- The manual operation lacks timers or automatic shutoff settings, so you need to keep an eye on it.  
- Being an all-metal build, the pot retains heat, meaning cautious handling is essential to avoid burns.  
- The sound of percolation might not charm everyone ‚Äì it leans loud when in full swing.  

**Market Rivals Offering Competition**  
Among electric percolators, a few competing brands come to mind. One of the biggest rivals is the Hamilton Beach Percolator, which shares similar features and durability but lacks some of the aesthetic finesse the Cuisinart achieves. On the other end is the Farberware Classic Yosemite, known for its budget-friendly price point but limited in capacity and lacking extras like knuckle guards.  

Where the Cuisinart PRC-12N stands out is its transparent knob, reusable filter, and ease of pouring‚Äîall meaningful aspects for frequent or casual coffee drinkers. However, if you need programmable features or faster brewing, the Hamilton Beach might fit better despite sacrificing some traditional charm.  

**Value for Money**  
Looking at the features packed into this percolator, it‚Äôs safe to say it offers solid value. Sure, there are cheaper percolators out there, but this one boasts thoughtful design elements that make it a worthy long-term upgrade for anyone seeking a reliable coffee maker. If you‚Äôre brewing for multiple people frequently or want an appliance that will look great on your kitchen counter while delivering reliably rich coffee, it‚Äôs worth considering this model.

Just so the intetions are clear. Very clear. But isn't it too much ? But then again I feel like it would be very easy to just get stuck in the ""besties"" category. Idk. I never asked a girl out or been with a girl before.

1kbjd4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1kbjd4h/the_world_went_quiet_below/,The World Went Quiet Below,"Our plane was ordered into a Holding Pattern. That was 17 Hours Ago.

I‚Äôve been working long-haul flights for seven years now. You pick up patterns. Passengers complain about turbulence in the first hour, then they get sleepy, then the cabin quiets down like a church. I used to love the stillness of that middle stretch‚Äîdark cabin, humming engines, people breathing in sync. But now?

Now it feels like a graveyard with tray tables.

We were about five hours into the Heathrow‚ÄìChicago route when it started. Everything had been textbook. Smooth air, full meal service, not a single drunken stag do. I was in the galley boiling water when the captain called us into the crew jumpseat area. The tone in his voice made my stomach go cold.

He said we‚Äôd just been ordered into a holding pattern. No explanation. Chicago Center told him the ground was experiencing ***‚Äúa high-security emergency‚Äù*** and advised all transatlantic flights to circle until further notice.

We‚Äôd all heard that term before‚Äî***‚Äúholding pattern.‚Äù*** Normally it means there‚Äôs congestion on the tarmac, weather delays, some VIP movement. But we weren‚Äôt even over Illinois yet. We were still over open water. The captain‚Äôs hands were shaking as he spoke. That scared me more than anything.

Then, thirty minutes later, our ACARS system lit up again. Short bursts of text-based information. Disjointed, garbled. Military designators, partial city codes. ***LHR‚ÄîCONTACT LOST. JFK‚ÄîIMPACT CONFIRMED. CDG‚ÄîMULTIPLE.***

We asked him what ‚Äúimpact‚Äù meant. He didn‚Äôt answer.

We knew.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

I remember the moment the crew stopped pretending.

We sat in the rear galley, whispering like kids caught doing something wrong. Beth, one of the seniors, said she used to work NATO liaison flights back in the day. She said if the cities were going dark like this, we wouldn‚Äôt be going home. Not tonight. Not ever.

We weren‚Äôt told to declare an emergency. No direction from ground. No safe harbor. No reroute. Just one final message: ***‚ÄúHold as long as possible. Await further.‚Äù***

That was ten hours ago.

We‚Äôre still holding.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

The passengers don‚Äôt know. Not officially. The map screens still show us gliding slowly in lazy ovals above the Atlantic. I turned them off after a woman started crying. Said we‚Äôd passed the same cloud formation three times.

She‚Äôs not wrong.

We‚Äôre in a loop. Not for safety. Not for weather. We‚Äôre just up here, like a paper plane caught in limbo.

A man in 27C tried to FaceTime his wife an hour ago. Said the call connected but all he could hear was sirens and distant screaming. He just sat there staring at his phone like if he blinked it would vanish. Eventually, he threw up in his seat and hasn‚Äôt spoken since.

We gave up on the inflight entertainment after BBC World News flickered for a second‚Äîjust long enough for a presenter to stammer something about ***‚ÄúLondon‚Ä¶ multiple strikes‚Ä¶ Parliament‚Ä¶ gone.‚Äù***

Then static. Followed by an Emergency Alert.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Outside the window, the world is on fire. We can‚Äôt see the cities, not directly‚Äîbut we can see the sky reacting to their deaths. Dirty orange blooms pulse on the horizon like infected wounds in the clouds, each one smudging the atmosphere with another layer of soot. The turbulence isn‚Äôt violent‚Äîit‚Äôs slow and shuddering, like the sky itself is struggling to stay in one piece.

Ash rides the slipstreams at thirty thousand feet, coating the outer glass in streaks that look like fingerprints dragged by the dead. Every now and then there‚Äôs a flash, too distant to blind us, but close enough to feel in our teeth‚Äîjust a silent strobe over the curve of the Earth, another capital erased. It‚Äôs like watching a planet die from the window of a waiting room.

One of the junior crew members, Jay, had a breakdown in the lavatory. Locked himself inside and screamed until his voice gave out. When we finally got the door open, he kept asking what country we were flying over. His face was pale, eyes wild. ***‚ÄúJust tell me there‚Äôs still a country,‚Äù*** he said.

I didn‚Äôt have the heart to lie.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Fuel is the question now. That‚Äôs the thing nobody wants to say out loud.

We‚Äôre not a military aircraft. We‚Äôre a 777 with commercial tanks and standard reserves. The captain‚Äôs stretched it by throttling back and looping through thinner air corridors, but that‚Äôs a temporary fix.

We‚Äôve been up here nearly sixteen hours. The math doesn‚Äôt work anymore.

And here‚Äôs the thing that keeps me up even when I‚Äôm standing: we don‚Äôt know where to land. Every major city has either gone dark or stopped transmitting. The places that are still *‚Äúonline‚Äù* are rejecting contact. Iceland denied our relay ping. So did Dublin. So did Shannon. So did Madrid.

It‚Äôs like the whole world went dark and nobody told us.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

A kid, maybe six or seven, asked me when we were landing. He had chocolate on his face and a model airplane in his lap. I said we‚Äôd be on the ground *‚Äúsoon.‚Äù*

He smiled and said, ***‚ÄúI hope it‚Äôs sunny.‚Äù***

I walked into the crew storage and cried so hard I bit my tongue to keep quiet.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Beth thinks we‚Äôre the safest people alive. ***‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thirty-five thousand feet above a mass grave,‚Äù*** she said. ***‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs not safe, I don‚Äôt know what is.‚Äù***

But even she‚Äôs looking gaunt now. She caught the captain staring at a printed map of Europe with three red Xs drawn on it. No city names. Just marks. That‚Äôs when she took off her watch and stopped checking the time.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

People are starting to notice the silence.

Not the kind you get on a red-eye flight, but the unnatural kind. No radio chatter. No ATC. No other aircraft visible, not even contrails. One man stood up and said he hadn‚Äôt seen a single plane cross our flight path in hours. That‚Äôs not normal on a transatlantic route. Not even during COVID. The skies should be littered with crossings.

But it‚Äôs just us.

A metal ghost gliding above the world, kept in the air by old schedules and the assumption that someone, somewhere, is still listening.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Some of the crew want to tell the passengers the truth. Others say that would be a death sentence‚Äîthat panic would do what the blasts haven‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know where I stand. Maybe they deserve to know. Or maybe the kid with the chocolate on his face deserves ten more minutes of believing in a sunny landing.

Maybe that‚Äôs mercy.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

The intercom just chirped.

It wasn‚Äôt the captain.

It was a voice I didn‚Äôt recognize. A woman. Calm, American accent, like a call center operator.

She said:
***‚ÄúFlight 389, you are currently designated Condition Echo. Maintain altitude. Do not attempt contact. All international emergency protocols are suspended.‚Äù***

Then silence.

Beth thinks ***‚ÄúCondition Echo‚Äù*** means exposure. Not radiation‚Äîknowledge. That we know too much. That we‚Äôre witnesses to the fallout, literally. The people below can hide in bunkers or burn in cities. We‚Äôre proof that someone survived. Someone saw it happen from above.

Maybe that‚Äôs why no one‚Äôs answering.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

The captain made an announcement.

He called the crew back and closed the curtain. His voice was quiet, eyes red. He‚Äôd been crying. He said we had fuel for maybe another hour, max. That he‚Äôd sent out a Mayday. No response. That even military frequencies were silent now.

He said the plane had a last-ditch ditching protocol, but that was *‚Äúnot ideal‚Äù* over open water. Which I think was pilot-speak for we‚Äôre screwed.

Then he said the quiet part out loud.

***‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre the last people alive.‚Äù***

No one spoke for a long time after that.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Thirty minutes ago, the captain changed course.

He didn‚Äôt say where to. Just adjusted heading and dropped altitude slightly. The plane banked slowly southward. Over the PA, he told passengers we were preparing for descent, but didn‚Äôt give a destination. Just said we‚Äôd be landing *‚Äúshortly.‚Äù*

It started in whispers‚Äîtight, frantic murmurs passed between rows like static, eyes flicking to phones that no longer connected, maps that no longer updated. Then someone stood up and demanded answers, and when none came, the cabin cracked. 

A woman screamed at the emergency exit like it was a doorway to salvation. A man tried to call his wife, then sobbed into the seatback when he heard nothing but silence. The air felt thinner, heavier, like fear was eating the oxygen. Children cried without understanding why. Grown men argued over whether the lights meant we were landing or crashing. 

No one listened to the crew anymore. Seatbelt signs blinked uselessly above heads that no longer stayed seated. It wasn‚Äôt chaos‚Äîit was collapse. A slow, creeping unraveling as everyone realized, one by one, that we weren‚Äôt going home.

Some people held hands. Some cried. The man in 27C started singing under his breath.

I stood in the galley and looked at the sky and waited for anything. A coastline. A port. A flare. A voice.

But there was nothing.

Just water.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

We‚Äôre still descending.

Low now. Too low. Engines throttled back so far they‚Äôre whispering. The sea looks like glass.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a runway down there.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything down there.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

If anyone finds this phone‚Äîif anyone finds me‚Äîwe were Flight 389, London to Chicago, departed 04:06 UTC. The crew did everything they could. We kept them calm. We fed the children. We handed out warm towels. We kept the coffee hot. We lied like saints.

Not because we wanted to‚Äîbut because hope was all we had left to serve.

We‚Äôre descending now.

*Lights flickering.*

*Still nowhere land.*

*But maybe the water will hold us.*

***Maybe that‚Äôs mercy too.***",1,1746027026.0,libraryofshadows,0,0.67,False

About a year ago I had a head and torso CT scan for unrelated reasons, and incidentally noted possible gallstones or porcelain gallbladder. The scan was otherwise normal. I‚Äôd had aches for years in upper right quadrant and was always simply advised to eat smaller meals more frequently. Pain was never severe and always resolved but was recurrent.

I started paying more attention, and in the months since noted three instances of more severe ‚Äúattacks‚Äù (after eating some fattier meals). All resolved within an hour or so with water and movement, so I considered them worth noting but not urgent.

I completely cut out alcohol and then began intermittent fasting so I‚Äôm drinking a ton of water and coffee. Between those two changes over the past few months, I‚Äôm rarely having symptoms.

I brought this all up to my PCP at my yearly appointment a few weeks ago and she agreed the symptoms + CT report was likely gallstones and worth having an ultrasound and GI referral to follow up. 

I just got a call from my primary that my ultrasound was normal. While I‚Äôm certainly happy to hear it, I was kind of under the impression that gallstones could potentially be managed but wouldn‚Äôt go away? I have an appointment with a GI dr next week, and I would like to have an idea of what questions I should ask or if there are any follow up tests or scans I should request (routine bloodwork was also not worrisome). If everything‚Äôs normal, great, but if something‚Äôs being overlooked I obviously want it caught and addressed now rather than have an emergency down the road.

1kbjc7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeRaw/comments/1kbjc7b/pap_the_ultimate_capitalist_in_singapore/,PAP - The Ultimate Capitalist in Singapore,"As you all know, the PAP recently increased the GST from 7% to 9%. However, that‚Äôs not the only way the PAP profits from ordinary Singaporeans. You would have noticed that the prices of all goods and services have increased over the years, far beyond 2%. Because rental costs for these businesses have been rising steadily. And the PAP government has consistently earned a huge profit by having a monopoly on Singapore's most precious resource: Land.

In 1966, the Land Acquisition Act was introduced, which allows the Singapore government to forcibly acquire private land at below-market prices. The government currently owns approximately 90% of all the land, giving it a de facto monopoly.¬†

The government, through the SLA, then sells land leases, usually between 30 to 99 years. This makes the land in Singapore a renewable resource for the Singapore Government. After the leases expire, the land will be automatically returned to the government to be sold again. Therefore, one could argue that land in a tiny city state like Singapore is an extremely valuable asset, possibly even more valuable than natural resources like gold or oil.¬†

Private developers such as REITs would buy these land leases and develop the land by building shopping malls, condominiums, offices, factories and more. They will then generate profits by renting out these properties to be used by the businesses that provide you with goods and services. So whenever you buy something or pay for a service, you are indirectly paying for the cost of land leases sold by the Singapore government. And because land prices have been increasing over the years, the cost of rental has also increased which causes the price of your goods and services to increase as well.¬†

The government has substantial ownership in many of these REITs through their sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings (I.e Mapletree, Capitaland). So the government is basically double dipping, profiting not only from the sale of land leases, but also from the dividends of the REITs! To top it all off, GST is then levied on all the goods and services provided.¬†

The profiting comes from residential and public housing as well. When you buy a BTO flat from HDB, you are paying for both the construction cost and land cost. HDB buys land leases from SLA at what they consider a ‚ÄúFair Market Value‚Äù. Of course, as land prices have been increasing over the years, this ‚ÄúFair Market Value‚Äù has increased as well. Remember, the government acquired this land a long time ago for a rock bottom price. And now they sell it to us for a profit at what they consider Market Value. This is one of the reasons why property prices have been skyrocketing¬†

In short, everything that you do is on land leased from the government which profit off you not just once, but at multiple levels.

And that‚Äôs not all. The PAP also has a direct or indirect stake in many essential sectors: utilities (SP Group), telecommunications (Singtel), airlines (SIA), offshore and marine businesses (Keppel, Seatrium), and more, largely through Temasek Holdings. Through its political ties with NTUC, it also has influence over key supermarket (NTUC FairPrice) and insurance (Income Insurance) players. Unlike most capitalist countries, which mainly rely on taxes for revenue, Singapore has built a system where the state profits through widespread land ownership and Government-Linked Companies.

Despite being in a much better fiscal position than before the COVID-19 pandemic, the PAP still has the gall to increase the GST from 7% to 9% during a period of heightened inflation and rising cost of living. They claim that they need the money in order to save up for a ‚Äúrainy day‚Äù in the future. But they seem to have forgotten about the ‚Äútoday‚Äù. What about the elderly poor who have to pick up cardboard just to make a living, or dishwashing and cleaning the hawker centers and coffee shops.¬†

Looking at how the PAP runs Singapore, it seems as though they are not running a country but a monopolistic corporation where the aim appears to be market dominance: driving out competition, consolidating control, and ultimately raising the cost of the product. Instead of the Republic of Singapore, we have become Singapore Inc. A profit driven, monopolistic conglomerate where the senior executives draw an exorbitant salary while ordinary workers bear the burden of stagnant wages, rising costs and systemic inequality.

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not against the Land Acquisition Act or building up a strong national reserve to protect ourselves during crises. What I take issue with is the hoarding of these fiscal resources under the guise of prudence with much of the wealth distributed amongst the ministers, senior civil servants and those connected with the establishment.¬†

Elections are just around the corner. Please don‚Äôt be fooled by the PAP‚Äôs election carrots, their fear mongering of Singapore collapsing if the opposition is voted in or their constant nostalgic reminders of the achievements of the 1st generation PAP. I advise all Singaporeans to vote wisely.",20,1746026963.0,SingaporeRaw,6,0.95,False

Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her‚Äîfumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna‚Äôs passing, the twins had been born‚Äîtiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday‚ÄîEmma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then‚Äîsilence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.



# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it‚Äîcruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel‚Äôs alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn‚Äôt bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn‚Äôt drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of ‚Äústages,‚Äù ‚Äúhealing,‚Äù ‚Äúcoping,‚Äù while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog‚Äîa golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was ‚Äúgood with kids.‚Äù Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn‚Äôt ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile‚Äîas if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors‚Äîbackpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper‚Äîquiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons‚Äîa plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye‚Äîplastered with ‚ÄúProud Parent‚Äù stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later‚Äîcursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car‚ÄîRobert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn‚Äôt fix anything. It didn‚Äôt bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest‚Äîjust enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.



# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn‚Äôt enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, borrowed thing‚Äîone that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically‚Äîhis grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill‚Äîfast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn‚Äôt stop. The child‚Äôs face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn‚Äôt move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert‚Äôs jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn‚Äôt learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine‚Äîbut not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still‚Äînot enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don‚Äôt remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy‚Äîmaybe six‚Äîslipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother‚Äôs scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn‚Äôt the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn‚Äôt stop.



# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water‚Äôs edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened‚Äîthe gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back‚Äîa touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet‚Äîparents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn‚Äôt stop. He didn‚Äôt look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma‚Äôs crib and Samuel‚Äôs racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn‚Äôt contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.



# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy‚Äôs body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other‚Äôs eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn‚Äôt last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned‚Äîcautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn‚Äôt stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall‚ÄîMiller Park‚Äîunder the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn‚Äôt feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party‚Äîballoons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise‚Äîjust another utility worker. He didn‚Äôt need threats or blackmail this time. He didn‚Äôt need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma‚Äôs old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn‚Äôt shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now‚Äînot because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn‚Äôt yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck‚Äîwhite flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other‚Äôs arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it‚Äîlooped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child‚Äôs name‚ÄîEli Meyers‚Äîsuddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: ‚ÄúHe looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.‚Äù

Then a new tab opened‚Äîher niece‚Äôs photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: ‚ÄúShe still likes hide-and-seek, right?‚Äù

Linda‚Äôs hands hovered over the keys. She didn‚Äôt call anyone. She didn‚Äôt say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week‚Äîsecondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

‚ÄúSabotage.‚Äù

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn‚Äôt make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn‚Äôt need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it‚Ä¶ they were just getting started.

  


# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren‚Äôt mourning Robert‚Äôs children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn‚Äôt enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song‚Äî""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn‚Äôt special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn‚Äôt scream. He didn‚Äôt run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely‚Äîbut deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy‚Äôs brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy‚Äôs mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him‚Äîsomething fragile and bright‚Äîhad been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn‚Äôt light a cigarette. Didn‚Äôt open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn‚Äôt revenge anymore. It wasn‚Äôt even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports‚Äîall of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn‚Äôt have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I‚Äôm coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

  


# Chapter 7: The Spider‚Äôs Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it‚Äîand maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins‚Äîevents that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn‚Äôt yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there‚Äîmapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don‚Äôt want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn‚Äôt just violence. This was love‚Äîtwisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn‚Äôt a phone number. It wasn‚Äôt coordinates. It wasn‚Äôt a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced‚Äîsimple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel‚Äôs Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria‚Äôs pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds‚Äîone tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria‚Äôs throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it‚Äî A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself‚Äîphotographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn‚Äôt been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

  


# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them‚Äîno bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph‚ÄîEmma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo‚Äôs yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn‚Äôt look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel‚Äôs face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion‚Äînot anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn‚Äôt happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn‚Äôt forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert‚Äôs lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children‚Äîtheir heads drooping in the cold‚Äîand then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then‚Äîslowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn‚Äôt acted alone.

And Halston‚Äôs nightmare was far from over.

  


# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond‚Äôs edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl‚Äôs body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still‚Äîthe dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn‚Äôt about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn‚Äôt trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn‚Äôt meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn‚Äôt want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox‚Äîthe bus driver‚Äîtook the longest. He didn‚Äôt speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn‚Äôt need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn‚Äôt needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed‚Äîsmall acts, each just a hair‚Äôs breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren‚Äôt.

At the center of the new web wasn‚Äôt a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.



# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone‚Äîa hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn‚Äôt recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now‚Äîtyped, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We‚Äôre still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn‚Äôt she?"" ""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now‚Äîsomething familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn‚Äôt needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it ‚Äúlooked wrong.‚Äù Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria‚Äôs front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",1,1746026744.0,stories,0,0.67,False

Cleaning those tiny, hard-to-reach corners has always been a frustration of mine. That‚Äôs why I was intrigued when I came across the **FXOICMI B0F4XK77MS** Cup Lid Cleaning Brush. With its claims of being a versatile 3-in-1 cleaning tool for gap cleaning and narrow bottle openings, I felt this had to be worth checking out. After putting it to the test, there‚Äôs quite a bit to unpack about my experience.

**Design That‚Äôs Functional and Space-Saving**

At first glance, the design of this brush impressed me. Its compact dimensions (5.04 x 0.94 x 0.94 inches) allow it to fit neatly in any kitchen drawer, but that‚Äôs just the beginning. The built-in hanging hole is a small but incredibly thoughtful feature. I hung it up beside my sink, and it dries quickly without cluttering the counter. Plus, the folding brush head rotates 180 degrees, meaning you can switch between cleaning modes seamlessly without much hassle. This made cleaning bottle caps and tight corners surprisingly satisfying‚Äîit‚Äôs like peeling the lint off a dryer vent; oddly rewarding.

**Cleaning Efficiency and Versatility**

From coffee mugs to thermos lids to the grimy edges of sports bottles, this brush tackled them all. It comes with three different brush heads tailored to specific cleaning tasks: one for bottle tips, one for narrow grooves, and a corner brush for those impossible crevices. Testing this on my reusable water bottle caps that accumulate an alarming amount of grime, I realized how much of a game-changer this was. The bristles were firm enough to scrub away dried stains but soft enough not to leave scratches on delicate surfaces.

**Strengths**

- 3-in-1 cleaning heads tailored for diverse cleaning tasks.  
- Compact and lightweight, making it perfect for use at home or on the go.  
- Durable plastic handle with a comfortable grip‚Äîno hand cramping after extended scrubbing.  

**Downsides**

- The brushes, while functional, seem a bit thin. I worry they might flatten out with heavy use over time.  
- Replacement heads are not included in the package, which feels like a missed opportunity.  
- The size could be slightly limiting for people with larger hands.  

**180¬∞ Rotation Brings Ease**

What sets this apart from standard cleaning brushes is the 180¬∞ rotating head that folds. It streamlines the process when switching between different brushes. On days when I‚Äôm deep-cleaning random items around the house, that versatility saved me quite a few back-and-forth trips to my cleaning cabinet. The brush heads would swap securely, although I did notice a slight wiggle over prolonged use.

**Comparing to Peer Products**

I‚Äôve tried a fair share of cleaning tools, ranging from silicone bottle brushes with overly wide bristles to more expensive electric versions. While those options sometimes offer niche benefits, this multipurpose tool sits in a sweet spot of simplicity and affordability. The FXOICMI version stands out specifically because of its multi-use heads, which I found far more comprehensive than my previously owned brushes. However, it doesn‚Äôt quite match the robustness of pricier electric models designed for heavy-duty cleaning, like deep stain removal in intricate bottle grooves. Still, for everyday cleaning, this soared above other manual alternatives.

**Value Proposition**

Many cleaning tools overcomplicate themselves with gimmicky add-ons, but not here. Judging it through the lens of cost-effectiveness, this product delivers excellent functionality for its price. Whether I use it to tidy up my ceramic tea cups or plastic tumblers, it works reliably and adds value to my daily cleaning routine.

Also, what's wrong we having a reserve/serious demeanor? We can talk about a virtually infinite amount of things, I don't bite, but I won't become an extrovert out of nowhere...

Hey friends, I was diagnosed with severe, high functioning ADHD in April 2023. I've been taking Vyvanse (40mg after titration, recently upped to 50mg) weekdays since then. I have my regular review appointment next week but wanted to ask here to see if anyone else has noticed this. 

I had pretty bad appetite suppression in the beginning for the first 6 months or so (until approx October 2023). Since then, I've been pretty solid in eating properly. 

I moved to 50mg up from 40mg in early March and I have noticed that on days when I skip breakfast (usually don't have lunch until super late in the day due to my job), I am way more productive than on days when I eat a good breakfast. My drop tends to be around 3.30/4pm and is the same every day regardless of whether I've eaten or not. 

My breakfast would be pretty balanced, high carb, moderate protein and fats, as well as a coffee. Cereal, toast, some meat, yoghurt etc. I avoid vitamin c every morning.

My therapist (can diagnose in my part of the US) simplied i'm developing something on the schizospectrum and like.. i've had increased issues for the past year but its been at a level that I'm not on meds, not hospitalized, ect and my therapist says i just have something developing early.

Honestly I think I'm just autistic or something and had some autism burnout which caused issues last year....

I didn't get assessed with autism cause, hey my parents didn't want something on my medical record like that.

Things that sound like autism: Sensory issues, i've been trying to get myself to actually do something by making a routine and its sort of been working this past week. (I've tried to do this multiple times and it always breaks down at the smallest disturbance). I do things that look like stimming/repetitive motions when stressed. I have some level of socialization issues. None of this is new. Sensory issues have gotten a bit better sometimes.

not sure wheres the line between needing routine with autism and just what most do. However it was to the point that I didn't really do any laundry or brush my teeth for a while and was just am wearing the same thing over and over. I've had familly suspect im autistic when i was younger as well. Also taking things too literally.

Things that made my therapist say Im developing/have some level of psychosis: occasionally i have a couple days where it all stops making sense. I keep sensing entities, sometimes I'm able to talk with them(mostly telepathically). I have a bunch of paranoia...mostly hidden cameras and i have various reasons why hey my familly likely is dosing me, messing with me to make me think im paranoid when im actually not that paranoid. The entities and everything aren't really negative. Possibly due to coffee, but i've had times where for a few days or a couple weeks I was just hyper to the point where I thought an entity wanted me to make a religion and then just it stopped but i feel calm now and still sense entities, paranoia, ect.

My grades got worse(but honestly maybe i just have autism and burnout although it coincided with the paranoia and spirituality pinging off). (And due to that, not studying enough, my foundations were very shakey in my pre-requisites.)  I have diagnosed adhd and it felt like my adhd got alot worse... I'm back to attempt to manage things by giving myself an actual routine, working out, journaling, ect (honestly I think this could all just be autism?

1kbj4qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1kbj4qh/the_weight_of_ashes/,The Weight of Ashes,"# Chapter 1: The Man Who Almost Healed

Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her‚Äîfumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna‚Äôs passing, the twins had been born‚Äîtiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday‚ÄîEmma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then‚Äîsilence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.



# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it‚Äîcruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel‚Äôs alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn‚Äôt bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn‚Äôt drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of ‚Äústages,‚Äù ‚Äúhealing,‚Äù ‚Äúcoping,‚Äù while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog‚Äîa golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was ‚Äúgood with kids.‚Äù Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn‚Äôt ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile‚Äîas if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors‚Äîbackpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper‚Äîquiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons‚Äîa plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye‚Äîplastered with ‚ÄúProud Parent‚Äù stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later‚Äîcursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car‚ÄîRobert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn‚Äôt fix anything. It didn‚Äôt bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest‚Äîjust enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.



# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn‚Äôt enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, borrowed thing‚Äîone that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically‚Äîhis grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill‚Äîfast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn‚Äôt stop. The child‚Äôs face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn‚Äôt move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert‚Äôs jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn‚Äôt learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine‚Äîbut not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still‚Äînot enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don‚Äôt remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy‚Äîmaybe six‚Äîslipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother‚Äôs scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn‚Äôt the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn‚Äôt stop.



# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water‚Äôs edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened‚Äîthe gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back‚Äîa touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet‚Äîparents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn‚Äôt stop. He didn‚Äôt look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma‚Äôs crib and Samuel‚Äôs racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn‚Äôt contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.



# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy‚Äôs body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other‚Äôs eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn‚Äôt last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned‚Äîcautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn‚Äôt stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall‚ÄîMiller Park‚Äîunder the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn‚Äôt feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party‚Äîballoons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise‚Äîjust another utility worker. He didn‚Äôt need threats or blackmail this time. He didn‚Äôt need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma‚Äôs old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn‚Äôt shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now‚Äînot because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn‚Äôt yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck‚Äîwhite flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other‚Äôs arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it‚Äîlooped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child‚Äôs name‚ÄîEli Meyers‚Äîsuddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: ‚ÄúHe looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.‚Äù

Then a new tab opened‚Äîher niece‚Äôs photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: ‚ÄúShe still likes hide-and-seek, right?‚Äù

Linda‚Äôs hands hovered over the keys. She didn‚Äôt call anyone. She didn‚Äôt say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week‚Äîsecondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

‚ÄúSabotage.‚Äù

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn‚Äôt make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn‚Äôt need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it‚Ä¶ they were just getting started.

  


# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren‚Äôt mourning Robert‚Äôs children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn‚Äôt enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song‚Äî""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn‚Äôt special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn‚Äôt scream. He didn‚Äôt run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely‚Äîbut deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy‚Äôs brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy‚Äôs mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him‚Äîsomething fragile and bright‚Äîhad been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn‚Äôt light a cigarette. Didn‚Äôt open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn‚Äôt revenge anymore. It wasn‚Äôt even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports‚Äîall of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn‚Äôt have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I‚Äôm coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

  


# Chapter 7: The Spider‚Äôs Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it‚Äîand maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins‚Äîevents that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn‚Äôt yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there‚Äîmapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don‚Äôt want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn‚Äôt just violence. This was love‚Äîtwisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn‚Äôt a phone number. It wasn‚Äôt coordinates. It wasn‚Äôt a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced‚Äîsimple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel‚Äôs Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria‚Äôs pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds‚Äîone tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria‚Äôs throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it‚Äî A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself‚Äîphotographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn‚Äôt been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

  


# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them‚Äîno bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph‚ÄîEmma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo‚Äôs yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn‚Äôt look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel‚Äôs face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion‚Äînot anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn‚Äôt happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn‚Äôt forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert‚Äôs lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children‚Äîtheir heads drooping in the cold‚Äîand then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then‚Äîslowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn‚Äôt acted alone.

And Halston‚Äôs nightmare was far from over.

  


# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond‚Äôs edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl‚Äôs body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still‚Äîthe dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn‚Äôt about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn‚Äôt trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn‚Äôt meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn‚Äôt want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox‚Äîthe bus driver‚Äîtook the longest. He didn‚Äôt speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn‚Äôt need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn‚Äôt needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed‚Äîsmall acts, each just a hair‚Äôs breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren‚Äôt.

At the center of the new web wasn‚Äôt a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.



# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone‚Äîa hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn‚Äôt recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now‚Äîtyped, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We‚Äôre still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn‚Äôt she?"" ""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now‚Äîsomething familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn‚Äôt needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it ‚Äúlooked wrong.‚Äù Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria‚Äôs front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her‚Äîfumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna‚Äôs passing, the twins had been born‚Äîtiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday‚ÄîEmma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then‚Äîsilence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.



# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it‚Äîcruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel‚Äôs alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn‚Äôt bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn‚Äôt drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of ‚Äústages,‚Äù ‚Äúhealing,‚Äù ‚Äúcoping,‚Äù while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog‚Äîa golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was ‚Äúgood with kids.‚Äù Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn‚Äôt ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile‚Äîas if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors‚Äîbackpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper‚Äîquiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons‚Äîa plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye‚Äîplastered with ‚ÄúProud Parent‚Äù stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later‚Äîcursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car‚ÄîRobert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn‚Äôt fix anything. It didn‚Äôt bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest‚Äîjust enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.



# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn‚Äôt enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, borrowed thing‚Äîone that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically‚Äîhis grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill‚Äîfast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn‚Äôt stop. The child‚Äôs face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn‚Äôt move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert‚Äôs jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn‚Äôt learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine‚Äîbut not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still‚Äînot enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don‚Äôt remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy‚Äîmaybe six‚Äîslipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother‚Äôs scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn‚Äôt the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn‚Äôt stop.



# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water‚Äôs edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened‚Äîthe gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back‚Äîa touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet‚Äîparents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn‚Äôt stop. He didn‚Äôt look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma‚Äôs crib and Samuel‚Äôs racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn‚Äôt contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.



# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy‚Äôs body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other‚Äôs eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn‚Äôt last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned‚Äîcautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn‚Äôt stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall‚ÄîMiller Park‚Äîunder the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn‚Äôt feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party‚Äîballoons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise‚Äîjust another utility worker. He didn‚Äôt need threats or blackmail this time. He didn‚Äôt need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma‚Äôs old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn‚Äôt shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now‚Äînot because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn‚Äôt yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck‚Äîwhite flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other‚Äôs arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it‚Äîlooped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child‚Äôs name‚ÄîEli Meyers‚Äîsuddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: ‚ÄúHe looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.‚Äù

Then a new tab opened‚Äîher niece‚Äôs photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: ‚ÄúShe still likes hide-and-seek, right?‚Äù

Linda‚Äôs hands hovered over the keys. She didn‚Äôt call anyone. She didn‚Äôt say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week‚Äîsecondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

‚ÄúSabotage.‚Äù

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn‚Äôt make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn‚Äôt need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it‚Ä¶ they were just getting started.

  


# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren‚Äôt mourning Robert‚Äôs children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn‚Äôt enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song‚Äî""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn‚Äôt special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn‚Äôt scream. He didn‚Äôt run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely‚Äîbut deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy‚Äôs brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy‚Äôs mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him‚Äîsomething fragile and bright‚Äîhad been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn‚Äôt light a cigarette. Didn‚Äôt open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn‚Äôt revenge anymore. It wasn‚Äôt even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports‚Äîall of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn‚Äôt have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I‚Äôm coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

  


# Chapter 7: The Spider‚Äôs Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it‚Äîand maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins‚Äîevents that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn‚Äôt yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there‚Äîmapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don‚Äôt want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn‚Äôt just violence. This was love‚Äîtwisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn‚Äôt a phone number. It wasn‚Äôt coordinates. It wasn‚Äôt a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced‚Äîsimple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel‚Äôs Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria‚Äôs pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds‚Äîone tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria‚Äôs throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it‚Äî A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself‚Äîphotographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn‚Äôt been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

  


# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them‚Äîno bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph‚ÄîEmma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo‚Äôs yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn‚Äôt look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel‚Äôs face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion‚Äînot anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn‚Äôt happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn‚Äôt forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert‚Äôs lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children‚Äîtheir heads drooping in the cold‚Äîand then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then‚Äîslowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn‚Äôt acted alone.

And Halston‚Äôs nightmare was far from over.

  


# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond‚Äôs edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl‚Äôs body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still‚Äîthe dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn‚Äôt about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn‚Äôt trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn‚Äôt meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn‚Äôt want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox‚Äîthe bus driver‚Äîtook the longest. He didn‚Äôt speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn‚Äôt need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn‚Äôt needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed‚Äîsmall acts, each just a hair‚Äôs breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren‚Äôt.

At the center of the new web wasn‚Äôt a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.



# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone‚Äîa hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn‚Äôt recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now‚Äîtyped, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We‚Äôre still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn‚Äôt she?"" ""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now‚Äîsomething familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn‚Äôt needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it ‚Äúlooked wrong.‚Äù Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria‚Äôs front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",1,1746026373.0,novelwriting,0,1.0,False
1kbj3mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/comments/1kbj3mu/798_the_unlikely_messengers/,[798] The Unlikely Messengers,"This is my Novella about a demon named Nabu who is possessing a low life man named Roger. Nabu is doing this in order to become forever infamous amoung demons and humans as the one who told humanity the big secret they were not supposed to know. He is writing this book and puppeting Roger through it. This is a small piece of the book that does not reveal much, but may give some insights in the feel of the story.

The Middle of Night

I could no longer resist‚Äîthough I didn‚Äôt do much resisting anyway. I needed more coffee. The taste was  something I very much enjoyed. I started to enjoy its goodness around the time I decided to become  more public with my sharings of the One. Coffee  holds a value of sentiment. The Merchants coffee house all  those years ago had bled two things into me. An undeniable desire to share the One and be known for it, and a lust for coffee that I had long forgotten. I was sent to Philadelphia to possess George Washington, though I failed and instead possessed another man. I sat at that Merchants Coffee House, day after day prodding some into my evil schemes all the while indulging in the pleasures of earths bounty. Now Roger has brought some of that nostalgia back to me with only a sip of coffee yesterday. I must not chase all those long ago desires. For that possession turned more into a joy ride, this was a possession of mission. A possession to make me great again!

Don‚Äôt worry, Roger got a full 4 hours of sleep. He slept from 9:00 to 1:00 a.m., give or take. I rummaged  through his darkly lit trailer for some coffee. I prefer the dark, and the dim glow of the TV contrasted with the red cherry at the end of Roger‚Äôs cigarette rather nicely.

Roger had very little in his small place, so it did not take long to realize he had an old beat-up coffee  maker but no coffee. He also had a well-used baseball glove, a few cassette tapes, some canned goods,  and an old slot car he made with Gabe and his dad as a boy. They would go and race every Saturday  night they didn‚Äôt have baseball. All of this was in the kitchen cabinet. He was not using the back  bedroom, just the kitchen and the living room.  
After I understood Roger kept no coffee, I decided I needed to take a small risk. I would need to drive to  a store far enough away where nobody would know Roger. I grabbed his keys and rushed out the door.  All the snow on the ground made it brighter than I desired. I got in the car, having never driven one. I turned it on and saw the lights shining brightly right on Stata. She stared at us watchfully from across the street.  

What was that old bag doing outside in the dark at this hour? It was 20 degrees! Most mudwalkers had  too weak of a constitution to be outside in just a nightgown at this time. I peeled out of the driveway,  spitting pieces of ice and salt that bounced off Roger's trash cans as I sped right through Stata‚Äôs judgy  glare. I did not mean to leave so quickly, but I was driving for the first time and I found I somewhat liked what I accidentally did.

I wondered as I got on the main road if Stata was going to be a problem and if I needed to take care of  her. Then I remembered that she was losing her mind and anything she told Roger‚Äîor anyone‚Äîwould  not be taken seriously anyway.  

Having full access to Roger's mind, I chose a place Roger had only driven past and never gone in, an  empty 24-hour gas station. I parked right in front of the door and walked in, grabbing coffee and filters.  The store was empty and every step I took felt like it was echoing. I was getting quite uneasy with the  store clerk‚Äôs eyes on me as I approached the checkout. The old man said hello. I made direct eye contact  with him and did not respond, paid, collected none of the change for the $10 I gave him, and left.  

I drove the Lesabre back rather fast with Folgers sitting next to me. I arrived home with no further sign  of Stata. If there had been, I might have done something. I was ready to be back in private with Roger's  meat suit and have a big pot of coffee as the night concluded. It was nearly time to give Roger control of  himself again.

Hey friends, I was diagnosed with severe, high functioning ADHD in April 2023. I've been taking Vyvanse (40mg after titration, recently upped to 50mg) weekdays since then. I have my regular review appointment next week but wanted to ask here to see if anyone else has noticed this. 

I had pretty bad appetite suppression in the beginning for the first 6 months or so (until approx October 2023). Since then, I've been pretty solid in eating properly. 

I moved to 50mg up from 40mg in early March and I have noticed that on days when I skip breakfast (usually don't have lunch until super late in the day due to my job), I am way more productive than on days when I eat a good breakfast. My drop tends to be around 3.30/4pm and is the same every day regardless of whether I've eaten or not. 

My breakfast would be pretty balanced, high carb, moderate protein and fats, as well as a coffee. Cereal, toast, some meat, yoghurt etc. I avoid vitamin c every morning. 

Does anyone else have this experience or any thoughts on managing this?

We are all friendly and like to watch shows and talk with each other so if you can‚Äôt do that it‚Äôs totally fine and you can go onto other projects but we‚Äôd just prefer for a nice team!üíó 
Here is a quick scene of my script that a lot of my team members like to show a bit of the series. We need both female and male. Race doesn‚Äôt matter we can change their skin color if needed be! I will send the character sheet when you‚Äôre interested and more. Add onanashie on discordü§ó

Here‚Äôs the scene-

""Why is surviving breakfast a thing?""
""Because once the other dorms get moving, it‚Äôs a warzone out there,"" Liana said, grabbing her jacket. ""Last year, some idiot got flown over by a panicked griffin. Broken collarbone. Traumatized for life."" Devina peeked out from under the pillow. ""Oh good. Death by stampede. What a noble end."" ""Better than pot killing,"" Liana said, already tying her boots. ""Pick your battles."" Aria shoved herself to her feet, still swaying slightly. ""If I get trampled, I'm suing."" ""You signed the waiver,"" Liana sing-songed, heading for the door. Devina dragged herself upright with the energy of a sad sloth. ""Fine. But if I die, I'm haunting you."" ""Get in line,"" 

Skipped a few paragraphs.  (All the lines are colored to ur character)

 ""We survived breakfast."" ""For now,"" Liana said grimly, tearing into her toast. ""No rest for the traumatized."" ""Or the hungry,"" Viola added, already stacking her pancakes five high. Outside, another dragon roar ripped through the air, rattling the windows. Devina glanced at Aria, half-laughing, half-ready to cry. ""Are we sure it‚Äôs too late to fake an injury?"" ""Definitely too late,"" Liana said, grabbing her coffee like it was a weapon. ""We‚Äôre in too deep."" ""Guess it‚Äôs time to embrace the chaos,"" Aria mumbled, her voice muffled by the table. ""Or get eaten,"" Viola said brightly, raising her waffle like a toast. ""Same thing,"" Devina sighed. They clinked their forks together solemnly ‚Äî warriors heading into battle.

N1: ""Wait until they realize they can cook at home."" N2: ""Yeah. But dodging flying bacon at breakfast really builds character.""
N1: ‚ÄúHow stupid can these girls be? She literally used pots as a wake up call‚Äù
Back at the table, Devina stared mournfully at her rubbery pancakes, poking one like it might bite her back. Aria suddenly froze mid-bite, eyes widening. ""Wait,"" she said, slowly lowering her fork. ""Why... didn't we just make breakfast in the dorm?""

We had two guests stay at our airbnb for 40 days. It is the basement of our house so we share the backyard and also can hear people in and out. 

Throughout this stay there were couple of red flags that we overlooked, like seeing several different people in and out of the unit (we don‚Äôt allow extra guests), guests being loud all times of the night, crying at 3 am in the backyard loud enough for neighbors potentially to hear (not upset because he was crying to But Daddy I Love Him by Taylor Swift‚ù§Ô∏è), not answering messages for several days but we didn‚Äôt want to cause any tension and figured we should pick our battles. 

I had also heard vacuuming noises regularly and they mentioned having done laundry at a laundromat instead of asking for fresh bedding, so I assumed they are taking care of the unit.

They had extended their stay a couple of times through airbnb, and on their last week mentioned potentially extending for another week, but didn‚Äôt respond to any messages until the time for checkout. After the checkout time has passed he messages me saying the app wouldn‚Äôt let him extend his stay, and he will have to create a new booking (with obviously new cleaning fee etc) so stupid me replies to him on airbnb messages and offers that he pays us on venmo for the next week to avoid more fees.  

Another week goes by, and the day of their checkout my husband knocks their door, ‚Äúare you checking out today?‚Äù ‚Äúi don‚Äôt think so, we need another week‚Äù. Well, thanks for letting us know in advance‚Ä¶

Next week the day of check out, my husband messages them to let us know when they are done moving all their stuff so he can inspect the unit - no response.

Now trying to pin down the root cause.,"I've had chronic bad breath for as long as I can remember. I try to manage it but most of the days its pretty bad. I tried medical help over the years with my PCPs, dentists, and ENT specialists, but nothing worked out. Recently my PCP prescribed Chlorhexidine Gluconate 0.12% mouthwash. That eliminated my BB almost 95% of the way in the 7 days I used it! No BB and dry mouth, tongue is moist all day. This mouthwash is typically used for gingivitis, which my dentist says I absolutely don't have. So was the source of my BB my gums and teeth all along???

Symptoms: Bad breath. Not room filling, but visible if people sit less than 6ft from me. Lick wrist test also smells bad. BB comes within 10 min of brushing. Dry mouth most of the time even though I usually drink 1+ gallons water per day, and I don't drink coffee or soda. Tongue has white coating most of the time and also feels dry.

Root causes eliminated: I don't have nasal drip. No known gut issues, including acid reflux (had done panel test some time ago). If nasal drip or gut issues were the cause then the Chlorhexidine Chlorhexidine mouthwash wouldn't have helped because it doesn't mitigate those? No H Pylori. PCP says no candida either. 

My dental routine consists of brushing 2x, sometimes 3x per day. Flossing after every meal. Brush tongue every time I brush. Remove tonsil stones with dental syringe and warm saltwater 1x per week. Gargle warm saltwater 3x per week. No bleeding or swelling in gums ever. My dentist swears my dental and gum health is excellent. But the effectiveness of Chlorhexidine Gluconate points the issue is my gum. How can that be? Or is the tongue the culprit? Is the dentist missing something that I should talk with them?

1kbj0a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kbj0a4/for_the_past_four_months_ive_been_documenting/,"For the past four months, I've been documenting everything my friend has said to send them to any potential partners. I don't feel bad at all.","I (22f) have been friends with John (25m) for just under two years. About four months ago, he started dating this girl, Anna (20f) but things deteriorated quickly in their relationship. From what John told me, they went on two dates over the span of one month but would also text every day. At one point, Anna text John and said to say that she had a big end of year exam coming up and wouldn't be as responsive because she was either going to be in lectures, in exams or studying. About 12 hours later, John text Anna to say good morning and she didn't respond.

18 hours after John sent that message, he sent Anna 8 paragraphs worth of text that ranged from fairly normal to fucking unhinged. The text included things like, woe is me pity party, saying how he's ugly and disgusting and he understands if she doesn't want to talk to him anymore to saying things like how he knew she was the one because he had 'no desire to try and fuck her on the first date'. He also brought up past mentions of traumatic events from her life as a sort of gotcha, as why she didn't want to date him. Saying things like 'I understand if XYZ event has impacted your ability to see who is a good person to date'. 

After he sent those crazy messages, she ended up opening them but didn't respond. She didn't block him or unfollow him or anything. She just didn't message him back.

This sent John into an absolute frenzy and he started going on this insanely misogynistic rant about how she must be cheating on him because she's not responding. And at one point said that he was considering getting back into her good graces so that he could make her trust him again so he could fuck her and then ghost her straight after so that she would feel 'the same pain that he feels right now'. 

I had to sit here and explain to this 25 year old man about the circle of trauma and how him doing that is fucking disgusting and not on the same level as ghosting a man after he basically professed his undying love to you because you didn't respond for 12 hours. John didn't agree and basically said that I wouldn't understand because I'm a woman.

Ever since then, I've noticed that John has just started saying really weird things. He started sending me borderline softcore porn on Instagram, and any time a woman was mentioned in any negative capacity, he would go on these long rants about how women are these disgusting creatures. He also said he discovered a new fetish for 'female with downs' and that it's probably because they 'can't fight back' and are easily manipulated. When I called it out, he said it was a joke.

It was at this point that I started screen recording and screenshotting pretty much everything he said, along with our actual text threads, so he could have context. My initial plan was to put them into this one big document and show them to him as some sort of intervention, because it was pretty obvious at this point that he was going down the wrong path. 

However, before I could actually figure out how to sort out this intervention, John texted me and said that he had managed to score a date with this girl who comes into his coffee shop fairly often. I've heard about this girl a lot. John always makes really weird comments about her, especially about her body (I feel gross even thinking about his comments). However, I was able to find her Instagram account through John's following. I messaged her and said that I was John's friend and that John had said that they were going on a date together. 

She was a bit concerned after hearing that I described it as a date, saying that they were just going to hang out on their lunch break. She then confessed that she only agreed to this 'lunch date' because John was 'acting creepy' and she thought it was safer to say yes then turn down the date because he has cornered her. She also mentioned how 2 of her coworkers had also been 'perved' on by John when they went to the caf√© (they work down the street from him). 

Here's where things get a little bit...morally grey. I ended up sending her this massive document that I had put together of all of John's weird texts. For context, these texts include things like misogyny, homophobia, racism, as well as weird comments about 'barely legal' girls, rape 'threats' (under the guise of dark humour) and fanfiction about how he was fantasising beating up his hypothetical girlfriend if she 'destroyed' something of his (like beating her up if she deleted his game saves). 

She responded a few hours later saying she read the document and cancelled the meetup. She also warned her friends/coworkers who were regulars at the caf√©. 

I don't feel bad about this at all. I am planning on ending the friendship soon as the shit he says and sends is taking a toll on my mental health. I guess I just need to get this out there as I have no one to talk to about this.

Eventually, I got my hands on the **Waterdrop 15UA Under Sink Water Filter System**. My experience with this sleek device has been a mix of satisfaction and some minor frustrations. Here‚Äôs what my daily usage revealed about this product.

**Sleek and Functional Design**  
Right out of the box, I was impressed by the minimalist style of this under sink water filter. The stainless-steel casing not only looks good but screams durability. It‚Äôs sturdy enough to withstand potential bumps underneath the sink, which is no small feat considering the chaotic state of my storage down there. The compact size is a plus too, leaving enough room for my cleaning supplies. 

**High-Performance Filtration**  
This filter isn't just about looks‚Äîit‚Äôs pretty impressive when it comes to delivering on its core promise. The purification method includes ultraviolet (UV) water treatment, reducing up to 99.9% of impurities like chlorine and other contaminants according to lab tests. I found that my tap water tasted noticeably cleaner. Whether I used it for cooking, making coffee, or just drinking, the difference was palpable. 

*Check [Waterdrop 15UA Under Sink Water Filter System] price on Amazon.*  

**Smart Operation Features**  
One of the most underrated aspects of this product is the intelligent detection system. I noticed how the UV light activates when water flow starts and stops automatically when it ceases. Not only does this save energy and extend the light's lifespan, but it also gives me peace of mind knowing that electricity isn‚Äôt being wasted unnecessarily. The engineer side of me can‚Äôt help but appreciate the thoughtfulness of this feature.

**Effortless Installation**  
As someone who‚Äôs not very handy, I braced myself for a weekend spent grumbling under the sink. Surprisingly, the installation was almost too easy. The ‚Äúno piping cut‚Äù feature along with the included adapters made the process a breeze. In under 30 minutes, I had it hooked up with no mess or cursing. Trust me‚Äîif I could install this, anyone can. 

**Strengths**  
- Intelligent detection system saves energy by activating only during water flow.  
- UV purification method ensures cleaner drinking water.  
- Minimalist stainless-steel design blends well into any kitchen and feels durable.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The filter system requires a separate power plug, which not all under-sink areas can easily accommodate.  
- UV purification efficiency drops slightly if the water flow exceeds 2 liters per minute.  
- Slightly higher price point compared to simpler water filters.  

**Competing Products**  
I had previously considered alternatives like the APEC Water Systems RO-90 and iSpring RCC7AK. Both of these implement reverse osmosis, which is highly effective at purifying water but comes with its own downsides, such as complex installations and bulkier setups. Compared to those, the Waterdrop filter stands out for its easier assembly and space-saving design. However, if you're looking for a system that re-mineralizes water (like the iSpring), this product might lag behind. Its focus leans heavily on UV filtration rather than multi-layer purification.

**Affordable Quality**  
Given its impressive features, the product offers reasonable value for its quality. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest filter on the market, the long lifespan of the UV unit alone makes it an investment. There‚Äôs also something reassuring about using LED light technology instead of a mercury-based UV lamp, which reduces maintenance hassles and avoids safety risks. This feels like a product designed to save effort and time over the years.

However exactly 3 weeks ago my bowel habits changed and I‚Äôve had unformed stools, ranging from liquid diarrhea to a mud-like consistently, basically daily, sometimes up to 5 times a day but usually closer to 1-2. 

I have consulted with 
- my psychiatrist - who I requested to lower my dosage of Zoloft from 50mg to 25mg to see if that would make a difference. I have considered getting off the med completely to see if that would help but psychiatrist and GI argued that since I had been on the med already for several months with no issues, it was unlikely to be causing these changes in my bowel habits. 


- my PCP - who suggested I take Imodium and ordered labs  to check my thyroid as I had some elevated levels in the past which could potentially point toward hyperthyroidism. I don‚Äôt really have any other symptoms of hyperthyroidism though and last time I saw an endocrinologist a few months ago he said everything looked good.  

I just got the blood draw today to see what my thyroid is mooning like.

- a gastroenterologist - who said it was probably food poising which was prolonged by ‚Äúpost infectious IBS‚Äù, prescribed 1 day of antibiotics and 2 days of generic pepto bismol capsules .

I also did a stool test and am currently awaiting the results. He said If the issue continues then he would recommend getting a colonoscopy. 

- and I‚Äôm in therapy as well to manage my stress around it

1kbiska,https://www.reddit.com/r/RichardAllenInnocent/comments/1kbiska/in_support_of_coatadditional/,In support of CoatAdditional,"I want to let everyone in this community know that CoatAdditional has gone above and beyond what anyone has done in the Pro-Richard Allen community whether they are on Reddit or not. Above and beyond anyone.

CoatAdditional has made sure RA has clothing such as a sweatshirt, watch, socks, and pants.
When he first went to Pendleton, for three weeks he could only wear underwear and a T-shirt because ‚Äòmagically‚Äô they did not bring his clothes from Westville.  They delayed shipment of his clothes for two months, and didn‚Äôt make it to Pendleton.  Therefore, he wouldn‚Äôt go outside for three weeks because he had no pants. She called the Warden and told them to get their act together. And, RA received a 3x or larger pair of pants that barely stayed on his body.

She makes sure he has money in phone account so he can call his family, NOT her.
She puts money in his food account so he is able to purchase coffee. It is absolutely disgusting that MA would say RA/KA didn‚Äôt sight the contract because RA didn‚Äôt receive a cup of coffee (or slightly more). 

I only make this post because CoatAdditional is a true friend. She has made sure he was taken care of for over two years. She had a friend who was wrongly convicted and knows the suffering a wrongfully convicted man can go through.

To all of those people who talk the talk, she walks the walk. Stuff it. I stand by my friend, she is dedicated to the cause.

# How Pharmacies Work in Europe: What Travelers Need to Know. 

In most European countries, pharmacies operate according to the same standards, but they differ from the usual idea of open-shelf stores. Here, painkillers and other over-the-counter medicines are most often behind the counter and can only be obtained after talking to a pharmacist.

https://preview.redd.it/fpabr9ekizxe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=331aa00682edb504ce8e05637a2b7ec571bda4b8

Don't be surprised if you can't find the medicine you need on display - **it doesn't mean it's not available.** If you go to a pharmacy, ask for the problem (e.g. headache) or the name of the active ingredient (e.g. paracetamol) and you will be offered the available options.

In some countries ***(e.g. France, Germany or Italy)***, pharmacists may ask qualifying questions such as who will be taking the medicine and whether there are other symptoms or chronic conditions. This is done not out of bureaucracy, but for patient safety - to rule out incompatibility or overdose.

**English is almost always understood in large cities**, but in smaller communities it is better to have the names of active substances with you and use a translator if necessary.

https://preview.redd.it/gf2ngu1pizxe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98d1325b92b358fa81f66d1eb1d73addc291aa81

**It is important to remember:** even if a medicine is over-the-counter, it does not mean that it will be freely available. In Europe, the system is based on trust and professional advice, which is a plus rather than a minus.

https://preview.redd.it/bh14iqwrizxe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b95da283e88abafa42e6ab1e2c7aa05a6ffd79d1

# Key Active Ingredients for Headache Relief

**In many European countries, the names of medicines may be very different from what you are used to.** To avoid making a mistake, look not for the brand name, but for the active ingredient, which is usually indicated on the package in Latin or local language.

Here are three of the most common substances that are used for headaches and are available over-the-counter:

**Paracetamol** ***(Paracetamol / Parac√©tamol)***

‚óè ¬† It is used for mild to moderate pain and fever.

‚óè ¬† Suitable for most people, including pregnant women *(in reasonable doses).*

‚óè ¬† It is often found under the names: Doliprane *(France),* Efferalgan, Panadol *(different European countries).*

https://preview.redd.it/4s8gg5y5jzxe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76ea882252b90da83f4162cd34f6daca887e65ce

**Ibuprofen** ***(Ibuprofen / Ibuprof√®ne)***

‚óè ¬† Analgesic and anti-inflammatory.

‚óè ¬† Effective for headache, toothache, muscle pain.

‚óè ¬† Popular brands: Nurofen, Brufen, Ibumetin.

https://preview.redd.it/m6ns5mk8jzxe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76eb3c98796605016e26cd98724c0ed7dfb00974

**Acetylsalicylic acid** ***(Acetylsalicylic acid / Acide ac√©tylsalicylique)***

‚óè ¬† Known as Aspirin.

‚óè ¬† It has analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory action.

‚óè ¬† Often sold as Aspirin C, Aspegic, ASS-ratiopharm.



***If you know the name of the substance, you can easily find its analog in any pharmacy. And in case of doubt, just show the pharmacist the list or the package from home.***

# Where to Find Painkillers in Europe: Country-by-Country Guide

Below is a practical table with examples of medicines containing popular pain relievers. It includes the names under which the medicines can be found in pharmacies in Europe, as well as the format of the medicines and the specifics of purchase.

https://preview.redd.it/zylupcqflzxe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=044ca848296ba52efeaaa59c31810568470e2561

The formulations may vary slightly and the medicines themselves may have different dosages. Therefore, always check the composition on the back of the package and do not hesitate to ask the pharmacist, especially if you have chronic diseases or take other medicines.

# Peculiarities of buying painkillers in Europe

Buying painkillers in Europe may be a little different from what you're used to. Here are the main points to consider:

In most pharmacies, medicines, even over-the-counter medicines, are not on open shelves but are stored behind the counter. To buy what you need, you will have to go to a pharmacist. This is normal practice - **it helps you avoid making the wrong choice** and gives you the opportunity to get a short consultation.

The packs are usually small - 8 to 20 tablets. **People here do not buy medicines ""in advance"" and pharmacies do not sell large packs without a prescription.**

https://preview.redd.it/eyqfrtuqlzxe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=699bb3d5c35a471f2f565e637eb1b37f8dfd5177

The pharmacist may ask additional questions such as: *who will be taking the medicine, are there any allergies, what symptoms accompany the pain.* This is not an interrogation, but part of standard protocol. The aim is to keep the purchaser safe and to suggest an appropriate remedy.

**In large cities, pharmacists often speak English**, but in smaller communities it is better to be prepared to show the name of the active ingredient or the package ***(you can take a picture at home or save it in your phone).***

If you are not sure about the composition of the medicine, do not hesitate to ask, especially if you are taking other medicines. European pharmacists are used to this kind of dialog and are eager to help.

It is also worth taking into account that combined medicines are less common here - it is more common to sell medicines with one active ingredient. For example, instead of one tablet ""for everything"" you may be offered paracetamol separately, and antihistamine only if necessary.

https://preview.redd.it/3o5x3m9tlzxe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ff76bcb8b005713b53b436bc759bc19942f0676

# What to Avoid When Buying Medicine Abroad

Even if you have a headache and want relief as soon as possible, it is important to remain cautious when buying medicines in an unfamiliar country. Here are some common mistakes and situations to avoid:

‚óè **Do not buy medicines without readable instructions.** If you cannot read the composition and dosage, it is better not to risk it. This is especially true for packages without translations or with information only in the local language.

‚óè **Avoid multi-component remedies unless you are sure of the composition.** Some products contain not only pain relievers, but also caffeine, antihistamines, antipyretics or even sedatives. For example, combination products with caffeine can cause blood pressure spikes, and those containing antihistamines can cause drowsiness. This can increase the effect, but also increase the risk of adverse reactions or incompatibility with other medicines.

‚óè **Do not buy medicines in supermarkets without a pharmacist.** In some countries, such as the UK or the Netherlands, painkillers are available in general stores. But it is important to remember that these chains may sell truncated drugs or generics with other auxiliary components. Often there are no instructions or explanations in the required language.

*It is better to buy drugs in a pharmacy, where you can clarify the composition and get help from a specialist.*

‚óè **Do not take a medicine if the name is similar but the composition is different.** For example, the brand name may be familiar but contain a different active ingredient in a different dosage - especially important for people with chronic diseases.

‚óè **Do not duplicate the active substance.** If you are taking, say, a cold medicine that already contains paracetamol, do not add another tablet of paracetamol to it separately. This can easily lead to an overdose.

‚óè **Do not trust advice from the Internet or forums without checking.** Even if someone wrote ""I bought it and everything was fine"", it does not mean that the drug will work for you. It is better to check with your pharmacist or use official reference books.

# Quick Travel Tips for Finding Headache Pills

In order not to be left without help on the trip, even if you forgot the usual headache pills, it is better to prepare a little in advance. **Here are simple but useful recommendations:**

‚óè **Carry a minimum supply of proven medications with you.** Even if you are flying on a weekend, put a couple of paracetamol or ibuprofen tablets in your hand luggage. It is better to be reassured than to run around pharmacies in an unfamiliar city.

‚óè **Make a list of the active ingredients.** Write down the International Nonproprietary Names (INN) on your phone or a piece of paper: paracetamol, ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid. This will help you explain yourself in any pharmacy, regardless of the country.

‚óè **Download an offline translator or a drug reference app.** For example, Pill in Trip can help you quickly find an equivalent of a drug in another country. This is especially helpful if there is no translation on the package.

‚óè **If you take painkillers regularly - take your prescription with you.** It is better in English, with the dosage and the name of the active ingredient. This may come in handy not only at the pharmacy, but also at the border.

‚óè **Don't be afraid to ask your pharmacist.** In Europe, pharmacists are well-trained and ready to help - just say, *""I have a headache, what do you recommend?""* or show them what you are looking for. This is often enough to get what you need without too much explanation.

https://preview.redd.it/5f8eczr8mzxe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54be3e3e412850880035665774c6a32c150dc02f

# Conclusion

Having a headache while traveling is uncomfortable, but not critical if you know what to do. You can find effective and safe over-the-counter painkillers in pharmacies in Europe, but it is **important to understand what active ingredients you need,** what they are called and where to find them.

**Do not rely on familiar brands** \- the same substance may be called by different names in different countries. Avoid spontaneous purchases *""based on a picture""* and read the ingredients carefully. And most importantly, do not be afraid to ask the pharmacist. In most cases, one phrase is enough to get the right medicine.

**With a little preparation, you'll feel more confident in any pharmacy in Europe.**

# FAQ: Common Questions About Buying Painkillers in Europe

* **Why is there no Citramon in Europe?**

Citramone is a combination drug that usually contains paracetamol, caffeine and aspirin. In European countries, such combinations are practically not used, as drug regulators prefer mono-drugs - one reason per tablet. This reduces the risk of side effects and makes the treatment regimen more transparent. If you are used to Citramon, you can buy paracetamol separately, and if necessary - caffeine *(in the form of tablets or coffee)*.



* **How do I explain to the pharmacy that I have a headache?**

The easiest way is to say, *""I have a headache, I need something for pain relief.""* ¬†In most pharmacies, this will be enough for the pharmacist to offer you 1-2 options. If the pharmacist does not speak English (which happens in less touristy areas), you can:

***‚Äî*** Show the word ""headache"" and the name of the active ingredient (e.g., paracetamol) on a phone or piece of paper;

***‚Äî*** Use a translator on your smartphone - Google Translate, DeepL, etc.



* **What should I do if the pharmacist does not speak English?**

This situation is possible in small towns or rural pharmacies. To make sure everything goes smoothly:

***‚Äî*** Have with you a list of the required substances in Latin *(e.g.: ibuprofen 400 mg)*;

***‚Äî*** Show the package of a familiar drug - even if the name does not match, the pharmacist will identify the active ingredient;

***‚Äî*** Use a translator with a camera function: point at a package or display case and get a translation in a language you understand;

**Being prepared for these situations is key to getting you the right remedy quickly, even without language skills.**



* **Is it possible to buy pills at night?**

In Europe, it depends on the country and the city:

***‚Äî*** In major capitals *(Paris, Berlin, Madrid)* there are pharmacies on duty *(Pharmacie de garde, Notdienstapotheke)* \- their schedule can be found online;

***‚Äî*** In smaller towns, pharmacies may close at 18:00-20:00 and be closed completely on weekends;

***‚Äî*** Sometimes the pharmacies on duty require you to call the number on the door or use the call bell.

**It is recommended to download a local app or website with pharmacy standbys in advance - e.g. Pharmanity (France),** [**Apotheken.de**](http://apotheken.de/) **(Germany).**



* **How do I know if the European dosage is appropriate?**

In Europe, the dosages may be different from what you are used to:

***‚Äî*** Paracetamol is more commonly found in a 500 mg dose, while 325 or 650 mg are popular in the US, for example;

***‚Äî*** Ibuprofen can be sold in dosages of 200, 400, or 600 mg - but 600 mg often requires a prescription;

***‚Äî*** Packages contain dosage information under ""Active substance"" (or Substance active, Wirkstoff, etc.).

***It is important to compare not the number of tablets, but the amount of active ingredient per dose. If in doubt, ask your pharmacist or check the usual dosage at home.***

3.

Welcome to another episode of Mechanical Mike.

As always, if you enjoy my videos, please like and subscribe. It really helps a lot, and once I hit another milestone I'll do another subscriber meet-up.

Today's episode is going to be a little different than normal, but, before we get to that, I want to pass along some personal news. As you probably know, Mrs Mechanical Mike and I have been having marital troubles, and we've actually decided to split up.

But it's OK. I'm OK.

I'll still see the kids every other weekend, and this way they won't have to see us fighting.

I just wanted to put that out there because I saw some speculation in the comments, and I really hate gossip, OK? I'd rather be honest with you guys.

Anywho, the second piece of personal news is that I lost my job. Yeah, the factory decided to pack up and move their operations to the U.S. Sucks, but what can you do, right?

So if you didn't like and subscribe already, please do so. Every click helps!

With that out of the way, let's get our hands dirty.

In the last few episodes we learned how vacuums work and we deconstructed a coffee machine. What we're doing today is a little different. We'll be taking apart an old fan.

And instead of doing that in my usual spot, my workshop, which I don't have access to since Mrs Mechanical Mike kicked me out, I'll be doing it on my kitchen table.

I hope you guys can see.

Tell me in the comments if you can't and we'll figure it out.

So, as always, the first thing we want to do is look at what the fan looks like all put together. Note what parts we see and where they are. Now, I don't have a diagram for this one, but that's half the fun, really digging around and figuring it out as we go.

I'm going to start by opening the body.

Sometimes there's a clean way to do that, but in this case we're going to have to brute force it a bit.

Basically what I'm going to do is take this saw and start along here, really elbow-greasing it until I get a nice, long groove, and then I'm going to take a crowbar *and really force it in there*‚Äîlike so, and then I'm going to press really freakin‚Äô hard until it comes apart *just like that.*

Boy, that is a real mess. But we'll clean up later. Right now we're going to see what makes this fan tick. Actually, let's play with the wires just a bit, connect them like so, and plug in to power‚Äî

Oh, wow!

It really does give you a new perspective to see it all exposed like that. A real anatomy. Here, let me wipe the camera and show you up close.

That's the heart, the lungs‚Ä¶

We are 2 months into our 3 month-long trip to Japan. So far we have visited Tokyo, Kanazawa, Takayama, Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, Yoshino, Nara, Onomichi, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Itoshima and Nagasaki. Onomichi and Itoshima have been our favorite so far, we loved the more quiet, off-the-beaten-path vibe and all the beautiful nature around. Onomichi was like a town from anime. Lots of sweet elderly people and school kids on their bikes, delicious bakeries, good coffee spots, pretty views, incredibly scenic biking route. Itoshima felt like Hawaii. Beaches, cafes, green mountains. Almost no tourists. Our toddler also seemed happier in places where she could play freely outdoors. 

We're currently in Nagasaki and planning the rest of our stay in Kyushu. I'm thinking of going to Kumamoto (+ Mt Aso), Kagoshima, Miyazaki (Nichinan? Maybe Hyuga also?), Takachiho Gorge, Kurokawa Onsen, Beppu, Yufuin, maybe Hita, before returning to Fukuoka. So my questions is - Are there any cute rural towns in Kyushu similar to Itoshima or Onomichi that I'm missing out on? Any scenic places we must visit? I would love any Kyushu recommendations!

1kbinio,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightscheap/comments/1kbinio/discover_the_best_allinclusive_family_vacation/,Discover the Best All-Inclusive Family Vacation Packages in Mexico for Unforgettable Memories,"Sun-kissed, sand-between-your-toes perfection. Is that what comes to mind when you picture a family vacation? Throw in bottomless ice cream, poolside service with a smile, and activities galore that keep everyone happy, from the perpetually energetic toddler to the eye-rolling teenager, and you're probably dreaming of an all-inclusive escape. And where better to make those dreams a vibrant reality than Mexico? It's a place bursting with color, flavor, and history, offering something for everyone ‚Äì the little adventurers, the sunbathers, the history buffs, and the foodies. But planning a trip that caters to a whole family can feel like a juggling act, am I right? Trying to find something everyone will love, manage budgets, and ensure smooth sailing can sometimes feel like a bigger undertaking than swimming the Channel. That's where the brilliance of an all-inclusive family vacation in Mexico truly shines. It's like a magic button for stress reduction.

### The Appeal of All-Inclusive: More Than Just Free Margaritas (Though Those Are Nice Too!)

Picture this: You arrive at your resort, bags are taken care of, wristbands are slipped on, and suddenly, a weight lifts. You don't have to pull out your wallet every time someone wants a snack, a drink, or a towel. It's all included. Think of it as this wonderful, liberating feeling where the focus shifts from budgeting every single little expense to simply enjoying the moment. For families, this is gold. It simplifies everything. Mealtimes become adventures in trying new things without worrying about picky eaters wasting expensive orders. Activities are right there, ready to be jumped into without needing cash or credit cards on hand. It's a chance to truly unwind and connect as a family, knowing that most of the practical stuff is already handled.

Navigating the world of family travel can be tricky, especially when everyone has different desires. Little ones might be happy splashing in a shallow pool all day, while older kids are craving adrenaline-pumping water slides. Parents might want a quiet moment by the beach with a good book, while someone else is itching for a guided tour to ancient ruins. An all-inclusive resort, particularly those geared towards families, is designed to be a hub of activity and relaxation, offering a diverse range of options so everyone in the family can find their happy place. It‚Äôs like a smorgasbord of fun, available to you whenever you feel like indulging.

Beyond the sheer convenience, there's a sense of community and security that often comes with these resorts. Kid‚Äôs clubs provide supervised fun, giving parents a much-needed break. Organized activities bring families together, creating opportunities to make new friends and share experiences. It‚Äôs a little bubble of ease and enjoyment, designed to make your family vacation not just manageable, but truly memorable.

### Why Mexico is the Undisputed King of Family-Friendly All-Inclusives

Okay, so we‚Äôve sung the praises of all-inclusive, but why Mexico? The answer, frankly, is multilayered goodness. First off, the sheer variety of destinations within Mexico is staggering. You've got the Caribbean coast with its turquoise waters and soft white sand (Riviera Maya, Cancun, Playa del Carmen), perfect for classic beach lounging and watersports. Then there's the Pacific coast with its dramatic cliffs and vibrant culture (Puerto Vallarta, Los Cabos), offering a different kind of beauty and unique experiences. Beyond the beaches, Mexico boasts fascinating history, incredible cuisine, and a warmth from its people that is truly infectious.

What makes Mexico particularly well-suited for all-inclusive family vacations is the established infrastructure. Resorts here have been perfecting the all-inclusive model for years, and many are specifically designed with families in mind. They understand that you need kid-friendly pools, dedicated children's programs, spacious family rooms, and dining options that cater to a variety of tastes (yes, even the notoriously picky ones!). Coupled with relatively affordable flight options from North America and a pleasant climate for most of the year, it‚Äôs a no-brainer for many families.

Think about it: you can spend your mornings building sandcastles, your afternoons exploring ancient Mayan ruins, and your evenings enjoying delicious Mexican food and vibrant cultural performances, all within easy reach and often included in your stay. The possibilities feel endless, and that‚Äôs a truly exciting prospect when planning a family trip. It's not just a vacation; it's an adventure playground waiting to be explored.

### Location, Location, Location: Picking the Perfect Spot for Your Tribe

Deciding *where* in Mexico to go for your all inclusive family vacation can feel like the biggest hurdle. There are so many wonderful options, each with its own personality and offerings. Let's break down some of the most popular contenders and what they might bring to the family table.

- **Cancun and the Hotel Zone:** Ah, Cancun. It‚Äôs practically synonymous with Mexican getaways. Famed for its stunning beaches and lively atmosphere, the Hotel Zone is brimming with all-inclusive resorts. *Pros:* Easy airport access, tons of resort options catering to different budgets and styles, vibrant nightlife (if that's something you're keen on, though certainly not a requirement for a family trip!). *Cons:* Can be very crowded and touristy, might not feel as authentically ""Mexican"" as some other areas.
- **Riviera Maya (Playa del Carmen, Akumal, Tulum):** South of Cancun, the Riviera Maya offers a slightly more relaxed vibe while still boasting incredible beaches and a plethora of all-inclusive resorts. Playa del Carmen is a bustling town with a lively pedestrian street (Fifth Avenue), while Akumal is known for its incredible snorkeling with sea turtles, and Tulum offers a more bohemian-chic atmosphere with stunning ruins overlooking the Caribbean. *Pros:* Beautiful beaches, access to cenotes (natural swimming sinkholes ‚Äì major fun!), archaeological sites nearby, something for everyone on the coast. *Cons:* Can still feel quite touristy, travel times between areas can add up.
- **Puerto Vallarta and Riviera Nayarit:** On the Pacific coast, Puerto Vallarta is a charming colonial town nestled between mountains and the ocean. Riviera Nayarit, just north, offers a string of beautiful beaches and luxurious resorts. *Pros:* More of a ""real Mexico"" feel with its historic downtown, stunning scenery, opportunities for whale watching (seasonal), great food. *Cons:* Can be hotter and more humid than the Caribbean coast in certain months, ocean conditions can be choppier.
- **Los Cabos (Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo):** Located at the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, Los Cabos is known for its dramatic desert landscapes meeting the sea. Cabo San Lucas is livelier and more developed, while San Jose del Cabo offers a more laid-back, artsy vibe. *Pros:* Stunning scenery, great for whale watching (seasonal), world-class golf (if that's your thing). *Cons:* Beaches often have strong currents unsuitable for swimming (though resorts have swimmable pools), can be pricier than other areas.

So, how do you choose? Consider your family's priorities. Are pristine, calm swimming beaches a must? The Caribbean coast might be your best bet. Are you looking for cultural experiences and stunning landscapes? The Pacific coast could be calling your name. Are you on a tighter budget? Research resorts with family-friendly discounts and package deals. Don't be afraid to do your homework and read reviews from other families. It's all part of the fun of planning!

### Decoding the ""All-Inclusive"" Jargon: What's Really Included?

Alright, let's talk turkey. The term ""all-inclusive"" can sometimes feel a bit like a black box. What *exactly* is covered? While the specifics vary from resort to resort, there are general categories you can expect to be included in your all inclusive family vacation Mexico package.

Here's a general breakdown of what you can typically expect:

1. **Accommodation:** Your comfortable room or suite, of course! Many resorts offer family-friendly room configurations with separate sleeping areas or multiple bedrooms.
2. **Meals:** This is a big one. Expect buffet restaurants with a wide variety of options (perfect for picky eaters!), √† la carte specialty restaurants (often requiring reservations), and casual snack bars. Drink stations with unlimited soft drinks, juice, coffee, and water are usually readily available.
3. **Drinks:** This typically includes alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, and basic cocktails) at designated bars and restaurants throughout the day. Some resorts offer premium liquor for an extra charge.
4. **Activities and Entertainment:** This is where the fun really happens! Expect access to pools and beaches, non-motorized water sports (kayaking, paddleboarding), land-based activities (tennis, beach volleyball), fitness centers, and scheduled entertainment like live music, shows, and themed nights.
5. **Kids' Clubs:** A godsend for parents! Supervised programs for children of different age groups, offering a range of activities from crafts and games to treasure hunts and movie nights.
6. **Tips and Gratuities:** In most all-inclusive resorts, tips for staff are included in the package price. However, it's always a nice gesture to tip extra for exceptional service.

Now, there are some things that are typically *not* included:

- **Spa Treatments:** Massages, facials, and other spa services are usually an additional charge.
- **Motorized Water Sports:** Jet skiing, parasailing, and similar activities will likely cost extra.
- **Off-site Excursions:** Tours to attractions outside the resort (like archaeological sites, theme parks, or snorkeling trips) are usually not included.
- **Premium Beverages and Specialty Dining:** Higher-end wines, liquor, and certain gourmet restaurants within the resort might have an extra fee.
- **Airport Transfers:** While some packages might include this, it's often an additional cost.

It's absolutely crucial to read the fine print when booking your all inclusive family vacation Mexico. Don't be afraid to ask questions about what's included and what's not. Understanding the details upfront avoids any unpleasant surprises down the line and ensures you can budget effectively for any extra activities or treats you might want to enjoy.

### Making the Most of Your All-Inclusive Family Fun: Tips and Tricks

So, you've booked your dream all inclusive family vacation Mexico. Now comes the fun part: planning how to maximize your enjoyment alongside the little (and not-so-little) ones! Here are some tips and tricks to help you make the most of your escape:

- **Research Kid-Friendly Amenities:** When choosing a resort, look for specific amenities that cater to families. Think dedicated kids' pools with slides and splash zones, playgrounds, game rooms, and comprehensive kids' clubs with engaging programs. Some resorts even have water parks on-site!
- **Check Out the Activity Schedule:** Once you arrive, grab a copy of the resort's daily activity schedule. This will give you a rundown of everything happening, from fitness classes and cooking demos to live music and theme parties. You can then plan your days based on what interests your family.
- **Book Specialty Restaurants Early:** If your resort has √† la carte specialty restaurants that require reservations, book them as soon as you can. These tend to fill up quickly, especially during peak season. It's a nice change of pace from the buffet and a chance to enjoy a more relaxed dining experience.
- **Embrace the Kids' Club:** Don't feel guilty about dropping the kids off at the kids' club for a few hours! It's a safe and fun environment for them, and it gives you and your partner some valuable downtime to relax by the pool, enjoy a leisurely meal, or even sneak in a spa treatment.
- **Stay Hydrated!** The Mexican sun can be intense. Make sure everyone is drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Take advantage of the unlimited drinks included in your package.
- **Pack Smart:** Pack for the weather, bringing plenty of sunscreen, hats, and comfortable clothing. Also, consider bringing kid-friendly snacks for the plane and travel days.
- **Explore Beyond the Resort (If you want to!):** While the beauty of all-inclusive is having everything at your fingertips, don't be afraid to venture out and experience some of the local culture and attractions. There are countless exciting excursions available, from ancient ruins to vibrant markets. Just remember these will likely be an additional cost.
- **Set Realistic Expectations (Especially with Little Ones):** Traveling with children, especially young ones, always comes with a few unpredictable moments. Roll with the punches, be flexible, and focus on enjoying the time together as a family. Don't feel pressured to cram every single activity into your schedule.
- **Factor in Downtime:** Even on vacation, kids need downtime. Don't overschedule yourselves. Allow for quiet mornings, afternoon naps, or just some relaxed time by the pool.
- **Engage with the Culture:** Mexico is a vibrant and historically rich country. Encourage your kids to try new foods, learn a few basic Spanish phrases (like ""Hola"" and ""Gracias""), and appreciate the local customs. It's a wonderful learning opportunity!
- **Safety First:** While resorts are generally very safe, it's always wise to take basic safety precautions. Be aware of your surroundings, keep an eye on your belongings, and talk to your children about staying with you.

Remember, the goal of your all inclusive family vacation Mexico is to relax, reconnect, and create lasting memories. By planning ahead and embracing the all-inclusive convenience, you're setting yourselves up for a truly amazing experience.

### Beyond the Resort Walls: Adventures Await!

While the resort offers a world of fun, venturing beyond its gates can add another layer of excitement and cultural immersion to your all inclusive family vacation Mexico. Mexico is chock-full of incredible experiences, from ancient wonders to natural playgrounds. Here are a few ideas for family-friendly excursions:

- **Ancient Mayan Ruins:** Explore the awe-inspiring ruins of Chichen Itza (one of the New Seven Wonders of the World!), or the smaller, but equally fascinating, sites of Tulum (with its stunning ocean views) or Coba (where you can still climb a pyramid!). These historical sites offer a fascinating glimpse into Mexico's rich past and are a great way to spark your kids' curiosity about history.
- **Cenotes:** Swimming in a cenote (a natural sinkhole) is a truly unique Mexican experience. These freshwater pools are often found in stunning cave environments and offer a refreshing dip, particularly on a hot day. Some cenotes are open and perfect for swimming, while others are more cave-like and require guided tours. Kids will love the novelty of swimming in such a cool and unusual place.
- **Eco-Adventure Parks:** The Riviera Maya is home to several fantastic eco-adventure parks like Xcaret, Xel-H√°, and Xplor. These parks offer a variety of activities, from snorkeling and swimming in natural inlets to zip-lining, underground rivers, and cultural performances. They are a fantastic way to combine adventure, nature, and culture in one place.
- **Snorkeling and Diving:** The warm waters off the Mexican coasts teem with marine life. Whether it's snorkeling with sea turtles in Akumal, exploring the underwater sculptures of the Underwater Museum of Art (MUSA) near Cancun, or taking a beginner's diving course, there are incredible opportunities to discover the vibrant world beneath the waves.
- **Local Markets and Towns:** Immerse yourselves in the local culture by visiting a bustling market or a charming nearby town. Sample fresh fruit, pick up some souvenirs, and experience the authentic rhythm of Mexican life. This can be a great way for kids to practice any basic Spanish they've learned and interact with the locals.

Remember to research the age and height restrictions for any excursions you're considering, especially for activities like zip-lining. Book tours through reputable companies, and if possible, choose tours that are specifically geared towards families. These often include transportation, guides, and meals, making the logistics much easier to manage. Exploring beyond the resort adds depth and excitement to your all inclusive family vacation Mexico and creates memories that will last a lifetime.

### The Price Tag: Budgeting for Your All-Inclusive Adventure

Let's be real, cost is a factor when planning any family vacation. The beauty of an all-inclusive is that it gives you a much clearer picture of your overall expenses upfront. However, the price of an all inclusive family vacation Mexico can vary significantly depending on several factors.

Here's what generally influences the cost:

- **Resort Category:** Luxury resorts will naturally be more expensive than mid-range or budget-friendly options.
- **Time of Year:** Peak season (typically winter and spring break) will be more expensive than the shoulder season (fall) or the off-season (summer, though be prepared for higher humidity and potential rain).
- **Location:** Some destinations within Mexico are generally pricier than others.
- **Room Type:** Upgrading to a suite or a room with a better view will increase the cost.
- **Number of People:** The more people in your family, the higher the total cost will be.
- **Duration of Stay:** A longer vacation means a higher price tag.
- **Included Amenities and Services:** Resorts with extensive included activities, multiple specialty restaurants, and premium amenities will cost more.

To get a realistic idea of the cost, start by researching resorts in your desired location and compare their prices during the time of year you plan to travel. Don't forget to factor in the cost of flights, airport transfers (if not included), and any excursions or activities you plan to do outside the resort. While it might seem like a lot upfront, remember that your food, drinks, and many activities are already covered, which can lead to significant savings compared to paying for everything √† la carte. Think of it as an investment in a stress-free and fun-filled family experience.

### Choosing the Right Resort: Not All All-Inclusives Are Created Equal!

Okay, you're sold on the idea of an all inclusive family vacation Mexico. Now comes the task of picking the perfect resort from the seemingly endless options. This is where a little research goes a long way. Not all all-inclusive resorts are equally family-friendly, and some cater more to couples or adults.

Here are some key things to consider when evaluating resorts for your family:

- **Family-Specific Amenities:** Look for resorts that explicitly mention having dedicated kids' clubs, children's pools, playgrounds, and family-friendly entertainment.
- **Room Configurations:** Can the resort accommodate your family comfortably? Do they offer connecting rooms, suites with separate sleeping areas, or rooms with capacity for more than two or three people?
- **Dining Options:** Are there plenty of kid-friendly dining options, including buffet restaurants with a wide variety of choices? Are there specialty restaurants that will appeal to both kids and adults?
- **Activity Programs:** Does the resort have a robust and engaging activity program for various age groups? Are there organized games, sports, crafts, and evening entertainment that the whole family can enjoy?
- **Reviews from Other Families:** Read reviews on websites like TripAdvisor, Expedia, and Google. Pay close attention to reviews from other families with children of similar ages to yours. What did they love? What were their frustrations?
- **Pools and Beaches:** Are the pools child-friendly with shallow areas? Is the beach swimmable and safe for children?
- **Safety and Security:** Does the resort prioritize safety and security? Are there lifeguards at the pools and beach? Is the property well-lit and secure?
- **Location within the Resort:** If possible, request a room location that is convenient for your family, perhaps near the kids' club or a pool.
- **Theme and Vibe:** Does the resort's overall theme and vibe feel like a good fit for your family? Some resorts are very lively and action-packed, while others are more relaxed and tranquil.

Don't feel rushed in your decision-making process. Take your time, compare your options, and don't hesitate to contact the resort directly if you have specific questions about their family-friendly offerings. Finding the right fit will make a world of difference in the enjoyment of your all inclusive family vacation Mexico. Remember, it's about finding a place where everyone in the family feels comfortable, happy, and entertained.

### Packing Essentials for Your Mexican Family Getaway

Okay, the resort is booked, the excitement is building, and now comes the dreaded task of packing. Fear not! We've put together a list of essential items to make your all inclusive family vacation Mexico as smooth and comfortable as possible.

Here‚Äôs a handy checklist:

- **Swimsuits (multiple!):** You'll be spending a lot of time in the water, so pack at least two or three per person.
- **Sunscreen (high SPF):** The Mexican sun is strong! Pack plenty and reapply frequently. Consider reef-safe options if you plan on swimming or snorkeling in sensitive marine areas.
- **Hats:** Protect your faces and scalps from the sun. Wide-brimmed hats are great for the beach, and baseball caps are good for walking around.
- **Sunglasses:** Essential for protecting your eyes from the bright sun.
- **Comfortable Sandals and Flip-Flops:** Perfect for walking around the resort and on the beach.
- **Water Shoes:** Useful for rocky beaches or exploring cenotes.
- **Lightweight Clothing:** Think shorts, t-shirts, tank tops, and sundresses. Natural fabrics like cotton are best for the warm climate.
- **A Light Jacket or Cardigan:** Temperatures can drop slightly in the evenings, especially during certain times of the year.
- **Dressier Outfit (Optional):** Some specialty restaurants might have a dress code, so consider packing one slightly nicer outfit if you plan on dining at those.
- **Insect Repellent:** Especially important for evenings outdoors, particularly if you're in a more jungle-like area.
- **Basic First-Aid Kit:** Include band-aids, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, motion sickness medication (if needed), and any personal medications.
- **Reusable Water Bottles:** Help the environment and stay hydrated by refilling your bottles at the resort.
- **Beach Towels (Check if the resort provides them):** Many resorts provide pool and beach towels, but it's worth checking beforehand.
- **Small Backpack or Beach Bag:** For carrying essentials like sunscreen, water, and snacks to the pool or beach.
- **Entertainment for Travel:** Books, tablets, headphones, and travel games for the plane and downtime.
- **Snacks for Travel:** While the resort has food, having some familiar snacks on hand for the journey can be a lifesaver with kids.
- **Copies of Important Documents:** Keep copies of your passports, visas (if applicable), and resort confirmation in a separate place from the originals.
- **Mexican Pesos (a small amount):** While many places accept US dollars, having some local currency can be helpful for smaller purchases or tipping outside the resort.
- **Adapters (if needed):** Mexico uses different electrical outlets than some other countries.
- **Underwater Camera or Waterproof Phone Case:** Capture those amazing snorkeling and swimming moments!

Packing smart helps ensure you have everything you need for a comfortable and enjoyable all inclusive family vacation Mexico, so you can focus on making memories, not running to the nearest convenience store for something you forgot.

### Beyond the Beach: Activities to Engage the Whole Family

While lounging by the pool or the beach is undoubtedly a highlight of an all inclusive family vacation Mexico, there are so many other activities available to keep everyone entertained and engaged. Resorts often have a packed schedule of events, and venturing outside the resort opens up a whole world of possibilities.

Think creatively when it comes to family activities:

- \*\* Resort water parks and splash zones:\*\* Many family-friendly resorts have incredible water features that can keep kids entertained for hours.
- **Poolside games and activities:** Participate in the resort's organized games, like trivia, bingo, or volleyball. It's a fun way to meet other families and get everyone involved.
- **Non-motorized water sports:** Kayaking, paddleboarding, and even sailing (on smaller craft) are often included and offer a great way to explore the coastline.
- **Land-based sports:** If your family enjoys sports, take advantage of the tennis courts, basketball courts, or mini-golf available at many resorts.
- **Cooking classes:** Many resorts offer cooking classes where you can learn to make traditional Mexican dishes. It's a delicious and interactive way to experience the local culture.
- **Spanish lessons:** Some resorts offer basic Spanish lessons, which can be a fun and practical activity for the whole family.
- **Kids' club themed nights:** Many kids' clubs have themed nights with special activities and events, which can be a highlight for the little ones.
- **Evening entertainment:** Enjoy the resort's evening shows, live music, or themed parties. It's a great way to wind down after a busy day.
- **Exploring the resort grounds:** Take a leisurely stroll around the resort, discovering the different pools, restaurants, and gardens.
- **Building sandcastles:** A classic beach activity that never gets old!
- **Searching for seashells:** A simple but enjoyable activity for all ages.
- **Watching the sunset:** Find a perfect spot to enjoy the beautiful Mexican sunsets over the ocean.

The key is to be open to trying new things and to find activities that appeal to the diverse interests within your family. Don't feel pressured to do everything, but do encourage everyone to step outside their comfort zone and try something new. That's where some of the best memories are made!

### Final Thoughts on Your Family's Mexican Adventure

I've been on my current team for almost 4 years and with the company for 6. I have moved up twice in that time and have had interns and part-time staff report to me on a per project basis but never a full-time staff member on a daily basis. Well, someone on our team quit (the next level up from me), and I applied for her backfill with the support of my manager and her manager. Unfortunately, due to budgeting issues, they've decided to put the role indefinitely on hold. Everyone on our team is devastated by this. That said, guess who is being asked to take on the bulk of that work including managing the employee that role oversaw? That's right - me! 

This is this employee's first job post college and her manager says she eager but prone to gaffes and mistakes. They want me to mentor her, but I'm sort of stuck on how best to approach this as newly her de facto boss? I'm extremely type A and a little intense which is perceived as a good thing at this job but I know can be a lot! My biggest fear is I have trouble delegating and just take on her work myself to fix any mistakes. How can I help her shine? Prove we need this role and that I'm the person for it? And not go crazy in the interim?

1kbin2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kbin2t/sour_shots_at_high_end_coffee_shops/,Sour shots at -high end- coffee shops,"Full disclaimer: I am used to dark roast milk drinks at home. I have an ""ok"" setup but nowhere near a decent one. I have had 15-20 shots at higher end places.

I recently went to a high end coffee place and had two shots of espresso, because I am chasing that god tier shot experience. I am very much into wine and tasting wine in general (just to underline my taste buds are not destroyed). I felt like the shots there were sour, to a point where the sourness overshadowed a lot of other notes and I had to kind of air the shot in order to filter away some of the sourness. It was a light roasted Kenya coffee and while I know their style is generally more acidic, I still can't help but feel like this is not how a good shot of espresso should taste. I know taste buds are different and I am used to a diluted chocolate taste with my dark roast, but I still feel like I would be able to generally identify a great shot of espresso from both light and medium roasts.

I guess I am trying to hear other opinions and experiences and try to understand if I am just not really that into espresso or if I am indeed experiencing sour shots when I try to get a good experience.

I just ordered a Zerno and I am planning to dive into light and medium roasts once it arrives but I was trying to get a good measurement beforehand, but what I had till now is just not really doing anything for me at all.

Any input, help and considerations? I mean, I've seen people talk about fruit and being able to pin point certain fruit expressions in coffee - I can do that with wine very easily, but I have yet to be able to do it in lighter and medium espresso. Pour over is no problem either, but I -want- to like and love espresso.",1,1746025241.0,espresso,13,1.0,False
1kbimzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kbimzh/explore_the_besnoow_i53_wireless_earbuds_review/,Explore the BESNOOW I53 wireless earbuds review for exceptional sound and waterproof design!,"The **Besnoow I53 Wireless Earbuds** earned a spot as my chosen daily-use earbuds, thanks to their promising features like ENC noise cancellation, an impressive battery life, and dependable Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity. I‚Äôm sharing my experiences, observations, and quirks below after using them extensively during workouts, office hours, and relaxing at home.

**Design and Comfort**  
Straight out of the box, these earbuds gave off a premium vibe with their sleek ""Mysterious Black"" finish. I‚Äôve got to say, the lightweight design, with each earbud weighing just 3.7 grams, is a highlight. They sit snugly in my ears, even during a sweaty jog or when I‚Äôm trying out awkward yoga poses. The silicone ear tips provided (S, M, L sizes) are soft yet secure. Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve come to rely on their IP7 waterproof rating, as they breezed through rainy runs or sweaty gym sessions with no signs of hiccups.

**Connection Stability**  
Bluetooth 5.4 integration lived up to the hype. Setting up the initial link with my phone was lightning-fast, and subsequent connections happened automatically every time I pulled the earbuds from their charging case. I tested their 15-meter range thoroughly, walking around my apartment, and even in the gym‚Äîno disconnections, no signal drops. For any wireless device, that‚Äôs already a win in my book.

**Audio Quality**  
The 14.2mm dynamic drivers truly shine, delivering immersive audio with perfect lows, clear mids, and crisp highs. Whether it was pumping electronic tracks at the gym or enjoying my laid-back indie playlist on a quiet Sunday morning, the sound performance feels finely balanced. The audio doesn't just sound sharp; it enlivens the small details in songs where most earbuds fail. I even found myself revisiting some pop tracks just to pick up instrumentals I‚Äôd missed before.  

**Call and Noise-Cancellation Features**  
Call quality might not sound like a dramatic feature, but for me‚Äîsomeone who frequents Zoom, takes work calls during commutes, or chats with distant relatives‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifesaver. The ENC noise-cancelling mic filters out most background chaos, whether it‚Äôs a barking dog or bustling coffee shop chatter. Four built-in microphones ensure clarity, making conversations feel like face-to-face talks, even when surrounded by noise.

**Battery Life and Charging Convenience**  
Fast charging and long-lasting battery performance made these earbuds indispensable. Each full charge gave me around 8 hours of music playback (confirmed through testing), and with the charging case, I clocked roughly 48 hours cumulatively. Frequent travelers might fall head over heels for the LED battery indicator on the case. It's easy to plan the next charge, and the quick 1.5-hour charging cycle means you‚Äôre never tethered to an outlet for too long.

**Smart Controls and Compatibility**  
Let me tell you about the controls‚Äîit feels futuristic to simply tap or swipe the earbuds for adjusting volume, switching tracks, or summoning my voice assistant while biking. The touch controls function smoothly, even when I forget to dry my hands post-workout. Plus, wide compatibility ensures they pair seamlessly with devices across iOS, Android, and even tablets. I synced mine with my laptop for an intense gaming session, and the immersive stereo sound worked wonders there, too.

**Highlights**  
- Ultra-lightweight, ergonomic design ideal for prolonged use.  
- Waterproof coating ensures reliability in sweaty or rainy conditions.  
- High-grade ENC noise reduction enhances calls amidst background noise.  
- Extended 48-hour battery life supported by quick-charging technology.    
- Seamless Bluetooth connection with a generous 15-meter range.  

**Caveats**  
- Touch controls are slightly sensitive. Accidentally brushing them when adjusting the fit paused audio more than a few times.  
- Despite IP7 waterproofing, fully submerging in water isn't recommended‚Äînot a flaw but good precautionary advice.  
- The ‚ÄúMysterious Black‚Äù style, though classy, tends to showcase dust and smudges if handled carelessly.  

**Competitive Options**  
Putting these earbuds head-to-head with options like the Jabra Elite 7 Active or Sony WF-C500, the Besnoow I53 confidently stands its ground, delivering impressive specs at a fraction of competitors' pricing. While the Jabra Elite offers superior active noise cancellation, it comes at much higher costs. Sony earbuds, though comparable in comfort and audio clarity, fall behind in waterproof design and battery capabilities. That 48-hour total listening span is a game-changer for folks who dislike constant recharging.

**Cost Efficiency**  
For an audiophile on a budget, the Besnoow I53 punches above its price class, offering excellent value for its set of features. Whether you're chasing solid waterproof earbuds for workouts or immersive stereo sound for gaming, this product feels like a smart buy. Competing brands might ask for premium pricing, but this delivers the essentials (and extras) without breaking the bank.

Can you tell me what to do so I don't lose my mind?,"Edit: Some people are asking me why I haven't already called the cops, but I'm in China, I don't fully understand how wellness checks work here and I'm only just conversational in Chinese. But I've just messaged some friends to help me contact the cops. Thanks for telling me I'm not overreacting this was what I needed to actually try to contact the cops.

Hi. This is my first post, because I need people to tell me what to think right now. My bf and I have been dating for a little over 6 months, and we have both been really busy with work and his dad has recently been sick so we haven't gotten to see each other as often these last 5-6 weeks. So about a month ago we decided to plan a vacation during a national holiday that is going on right now. We both are early in our careers and don't make much but we decided to use a bit of savings and fly to a nearby country and have a beach vacation, stay in some hotels, swim and the lot. We've both been so excited for this trip. He's planned most of the general stuff, which days and times we should fly, he booked all the hotels ( we were going to go back and forth between some islands), and messaging me almost every day this week with weather updates and things we could do. I have been super busy with work but cut out some time earlier this week to make a more in depth schedule so we could make the most out of our vacation and to book some stuff for us to do to ensure we would have tickets. It was all going perfectly, we were both clearly excited and had spent a good amount of money. I know he already spent at least $1000 booking stuff, so he was very invested. Plus he is the one who initially came up with the plan and invited me.

Here's where the story turns. (Keep in mind our flight is at 9:10 this morning , the 30th, so we had loose plans to meet near my street and get a taxi at 7:30) Yesterday the 29th I have wifi issues at my apartment, so I don't get a ""good morning"" message. (When we first started dating I kind of found these a bit annoying but I've grown to love them so much, and I know it means a lot to him that I say good-morning back so i try my best to respond within a few hours) So I go to a coffee shop and see that he hasn't messaged me, which I find a little weird but I take the opportunity to be the one to say good-morning first (something I very rarely get to do since he works a 9-5 and I'm remote) and I get to work on my latest project and don't think too much of it. Then a little later I send him the latest ideas for our trip and ask if hes bringing any nicer clothes if we want to do a slightly fancier dinner one night. No response. This man is always ALWAYS on his phone, he responds so fast sometimes it gives me whiplash and its been hours and... nothing. But I know hes at work and I feel a little crazy for even thinking anything of it. I accidentally leave him for hours sometimes because I'm not as attached to my phone so its not a big deal if he doesn't respond quickly, but it is weird for him.

A few hours later I send him a booking confirmation. No response. I finish my work and go home. Then 5:30 rolls around, and I know he should be off work. I message him again and no response. An hour later I message again because I'm getting worried he isn't messaging back the night before our flight. No response. I call him a couple times and he doesn't pick up so by 7/7:30 I'm stressing out, and I walk over to his apartment (a 5 min walk from mine). His bike is outside his door but I knock for 20ish min, and NO RESPONSE. I'm trying to come up with excuses. Maybe he had to work super late? He's at dinner? His phone is dead or broken? I go home and just pack and go to sleep.

This morning still nothing. We planned to leave at 7:30, so I get ready as I would have and try calling him a few times. At 7:30 I go out to the street corner where we normally have met before and wait. To get to the airport in time to check in we have to leave by 8:00 at the absolute latest. I message and call him the whole time and NOTHING. At 8:01 I head to his apartment again. I'm pounding on the door, calling him, there is nothing, no response. His shoes are there that I can see, his bike outside unmoved from the day before. We have missed our flight, so I request a refund on the site while literally sitting against his door. (I miraculously got the refund BTW) and I cancel any bookings I made, all of which went through. So I'm super sad about missing our vacation but I wan to emphasize that I'm not mad about the money, I was able to get it back. I'm scared at this point.

He's been the perfect boyfriend, he brought flowers to my place when I got sick, he is always on time to pick me up for our dates, he plans things for us, we've never fought, I don't even think I've ever seen him annoyed with me, and I'm super annoying. The last time a saw him ( The 24th?) His last words to me were ""I love you"" like 3 times, and then when I left me messaged that he ""loved being with me"" and then later I got a goodnight message.

Cut to today and suddenly its radio silence. Nothing. I'm crying at this point and accept that he's probably not home or I would have hear him so I go home and just cry and get pizza and wine and message him approx. 100000000 times, and try to call and NOTHING.

I haven't met his family yet so I don't have their contacts, I've met a couple of his friends and workmates in passing but didn't think to get any of their numbers, why would I? I know the buildings where he works but not where his office is or the name of the company (its not my native language and names are really hard for me to remember so he might have told me but I forgot if he did), My point is that I have no way of contacting him. If he is in the hospital or something no one is going to think to call me.

It's the evening of the 30th as I'm tying this. I recently got back from his apartment again and his bike hasn't moved. I taped a message to his door to call me, and my contact info for anyone who goes to his apartment in case someone else might know what happened. I can't think of anything else to do and I'm terrified and crying constantly thinking the worst.

I'm trying to think of what could possibly be happening. He takes his bike everywhere but its outside his apartment unmoved. He spent a lot of money on tickets for this trip and then didn't show. Where I live you need your phone to use taxis and metros and such, and there are charging ports and repair shops everywhere so even if his phone died the 29th or broke it would be fine by now. My best idea is that there was some sort of family emergency? maybe with his dad who is sick, that he had to go early on the 29th to see them and after he got there he lost his phone and has been super crazy with family stuff that he hasn't had the bandwidth to go get a new phone. He also just has my contact saved and doesn't have my number memorized (we use wechat), so he wouldnt be able to contact me on another phone.

I've cried more today then in the past year. Please tell me other things I can try, or other excuses for why he isn't responding and didn't go on the trip. I'm so scared. When I was at his apartment door tonight all I could think is ""what if he fell and hit his head and hes on the other side of this door dead?"", but I'm not about to go full crazy and call the cops. Though I'm considering it at this point. Because the image wont leave my head and something is wrong I can feel it.

The custom espresso cup is more than just a vessel for your morning caffeine fix; it‚Äôs a statement piece, a branding opportunity, and a way to elevate the entire coffee experience. For businesses, custom cups reinforce brand identity and create a lasting impression. For individuals, they offer a chance to express personal style and add a touch of elegance to their daily ritual. Selecting the right custom espresso cup involves considering various factors, from material and size to design and printing techniques.This guide will help you navigate the options and choose the perfect custom espresso cups to meet your specific needs and preferences.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a custom espresso cup involves more than just aesthetics; key features dictate the cup's usability, durability, and effectiveness in showcasing your design. Let's explore some of the most important technical specifications.

**Material:**

The material of an espresso cup significantly impacts its heat retention, durability, and overall feel. Porcelain is a popular choice due to its elegance, excellent heat retention, and non-porous surface, which prevents flavor absorption. Ceramic is more durable and often more affordable than porcelain,making it suitable for high-volume use. Glass offers a modern aesthetic and allows you to appreciate the crema of your espresso, but it may not retain heat as effectively as porcelain or ceramic. Stainless steel is incredibly durable and offers excellent insulation, but it may not provide the same sensory experience as conventional materials.

**Size and Shape:**

Espresso cups are typically smaller than regular coffee cups, ranging from 2 to 3 ounces (60-90 ml) in capacity. The shape can also affect the espresso's taste and aroma. A narrower base and wider opening help to concentrate the aroma, while a thicker wall can help maintain the espresso's temperature.Standard espresso cups are often cylindrical or slightly tapered, but other shapes, like tulip or bell shapes, are available to enhance the drinking experience. The ergonomic design of the handle is also crucial for a comfortable grip and ease of use.

**Printing Technique:**

The printing technique used to apply your custom design is a critical factor in ensuring its longevity and visual appeal.Screen printing is a cost-effective method for simple, single-color designs, while pad printing is suitable for more complex, multi-color designs on curved surfaces. dye sublimation is an excellent choice for vibrant, full-color designs that wrap around the entire cup, as it infuses the ink directly into the material. For premium results, consider using methods like decal application or engraving, although these tend to be more expensive. Direct-to-object printing (DTO) is a relatively new technology that allows for high-resolution, full-color printing directly onto the cup surface.

**Durability and Heat Resistance:**

Espresso cups, especially those used in commercial settings, must withstand frequent use and washing. Look for cups made from durable materials and featuring high-quality printing that won‚Äôt fade or chip easily. Heat resistance is also essential for keeping your espresso hot without burning your hands. Porcelain and ceramic cups are generally excellent at retaining heat, while double-walled glass and stainless steel options offer even better insulation.Check the manufacturer's specifications for temperature ratings and dishwasher safety.

**Customization Options:**

The degree of customization available is a key factor depending on your branding or personal design goals. Some manufacturers offer limited customization options, such as adding a logo or text in a specific font. Others provide complete design freedom,allowing you to create custom colors,patterns,and shapes. Consider whether you need full-wrap printing, interior design elements, or specialized finishes, such as matte or gloss coatings. The availability of design support and proofing services can also be beneficial, especially if you are not a professional designer.

**Compliance and safety:**

Ensure that the custom espresso cups comply with relevant safety standards and regulations, especially if they will be used in a commercial setting. Look for certifications like FDA approval or compliance with European regulations for food contact materials. Inquire about the materials used in the cups and printing process to ensure they are free from harmful substances like lead and cadmium. A reputable manufacturer should be able to provide documentation verifying their products' safety and compliance.

Also if you notice anything wrong with my writing or anything you like let me know feedback is always appreciated!! Here is an except from my novel. Thanks!!

The eyes that glow in the dark are bright blue.
	Blue? Unusual. The Detective thinks. Three more sets of eyes appear from the back rooms.
	‚ÄúDeath.‚Äù A demonic voices whispers in the hallway. The four basket cases begin yelling and rushing down the hallway in a full sprint. The Detective turns to the right and rushes into the first door. He runs to the broken window in the back of the room. He looks down and is greeted by a straight drop to the concrete.
	Jumping isn‚Äôt an option. Well maybe not for me. The Detective thinks. 
    The first basket case rushes into the room. He has cuts over all of his body head to toe, His head is shaved and his clothes are ripped and stained with blood and other fluids. He lunges at the Detective. The Detective crouches down as the basket case grabs him. The detective then springs up flipping the Basket case through the window. The sound of glass shattering is muffled but he yells for the other Basket cases entering the room. As he comes up from flipping the first basket case he slices the woman up the abdomen who was behind the first basket case. She doesn't flinch or scream. Just relentless rage. She swings her hands down and slams on the Detective head. He falls back against the wall that almost caves in from all the mildew. The Detective hears the splat and crunch of the first basket case hitting the pavement.  
	One down. The Detective thinks. Another barrage from the woman lands a few blows on the Detective. She is yelling and screaming. The Detective grabs her head mid scream and slams it into the wall. Her head bursts through the drywall and traps her. Her muffled screaming and cursing fills the room. The third basket case is an extremely large man. He is in nothing but boxers. His fists are bloodied and raw almost to the bone. The large man yells and begins running, shaking the whole room. The Detective throws his knife lodging it into the skull of the large man. He collapses and hits the floor with a thud. The last basket case stands in the doorway. He is the only one dressed in clean clothes. He has slicked back hair and brass knuckles on both fists. He slowly walks into the room. His demeanor is calm and focused. He steps over the large basket case body and raises his fists. 
	‚ÄúDeath is the way out.‚Äù The man says in a raspy demonic tone.
	‚ÄúFor you it is.‚Äù The Detective says. The man swings with his right but gets blocked by the Detective. An exchange of blows goes back and forth. Each attack being blocked in the nick of time. The Detective is pushed back with every blow until he hits the wall. With no room left a blow from the brass knuckles lands on the Detectives left cheek. It knocks him back making a dent in the wall. Another blow from the other side knocks one of the Detective Molars out. Blood fills his mouth and another blow is coming down on his head. The Detective in a last ditch effort tackles the man lifting him up and slamming him on the large basket case. The floor caves in and all three of them fall to the first floor. They land and break a large coffee table that splinters apart. The Detective hears gurgling from the man with brass knuckles. He sees a piece of the coffee table lodged in the man's throat. The sharp wood is soaked in blood and blood is spraying like a fountain. The man's eyes are still focused on the Detective as he tries and swings at him still. The Detective stands up and pulls out his knife from the skull of the large man. A large crunch and splat sounds when the knife is pulled. Before the Detective can finish off the man the gurgling stops and he goes limp. His eyes change back to normal. The Detective hears the Woman upstairs go quiet. Her body slumps and slams on the floor.
	Once the man died, so did the woman? How was this man so controlled? Mania is sporadic and chaotic. This was thought out and intentional. The Detective thinks. He stands and wipes the dirt and dust off his pants and shirt. He takes a few deep breaths until he hears a voice from another woman in the corner of the room.

Him:  ""Yo, is that a Rolex? Looks expensive.""

I laughed while saying ""Nah,  it‚Äôs a Hamilton. The price of this watch lower than the cost of a Rolex by a significant amount.

 The barista looked at me through narrowed eyes before asking ""How much we talkin‚Äô?""

 Me: ""Like, $600?""

The milk pitcher almost slipped from his hands when he heard the price  of $600 for the watch. The watch costs as much as his entire monthly rent payment according to  him.

1kbib0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1kbib0w/explore_if_the_britax_blively_gen2_travel_system/,Explore if the Britax B-Lively Gen2 Travel System is worth it review!,"The Britax S12776200 B-Lively & B-Safe Gen2 Travel System has been my trusted companion for the past few weeks, and let me just say‚Äîit‚Äôs been a ride (quite literally) worth writing about! With its sleek Greystone SafeWash color and functional design, this travel system gives off a vibe that seamlessly blends safety, practicality, and a dash of sophistication. I‚Äôve tested everything from the stroller‚Äôs maneuverability during long walks in the park to the infant car seat‚Äôs installation during a chaotic morning, and there‚Äôs a lot to break down here for those curious about this product.

**Impeccable Design and Build Quality**

The first thing you notice about this travel system is its sturdy construction. The stroller, crafted with an alloy steel frame, feels robust without being overly heavy. With dimensions of 33 x 23 x 40 inches, it‚Äôs spacious enough for your little one and compact enough to easily navigate through crowded areas or fit into tighter spaces. The car seat, on the other hand, shows its thoughtful build with a steel-reinforced base and a Safe Cell crumple zone‚Äîa feature that brings peace of mind while driving. Also, the fabric isn‚Äôt just comfortable, it‚Äôs naturally flame-retardant and machine washable, making it a hit with parents who value cleanliness.

Check [BRITAX S12776200 B-Lively & B-Safe Gen2 Travel System] price on Amazon.

**Comfort and Safety Features***

One of my favorite things about this system is how well it caters to safety and comfort. The infant car seat comes with a protective shell lined with foam to provide head-to-toe safety for babies between 4 to 35 pounds. The five-point harness adds another layer of security while being wonderfully easy to adjust. My niece, who usually fusses during car rides, seemed cozy and content during our outing. The stroller‚Äôs all-wheel suspension also deserves a shout-out. Whether we were on gravel paths, bumpy sidewalks, or smooth floors, the stroller provided a consistent, smooth ride.

**Winning Points**

- Lightweight stroller design makes it easy to carry and maneuver.  
- All-wheel suspension ensures a smooth and stable stroll on different surfaces.  
- Easy installation of the car seat using the SafeCenter LATCH system.  
- Spacious storage basket for carrying diaper bags and other essentials.  

**Critiques**

Despite numerous highlights, there are a few areas for improvement. The folded size, though reduced to 29 x 24 x 12 inches, may still feel bulky for those with smaller trunk spaces. Also, at 40 pounds when combined, the travel system isn‚Äôt the lightest option on the market. Lastly, the stroller‚Äôs canopy could use a bit more extension for maximum sun protection, especially during summer outings.  

**Practical Usability and Everyday Experience**

The one-hand quick fold feature is a lifesaver. I tried storing it after grocery runs and park visits, and true to its claim, you really can collapse it in just seconds‚Äîwhile holding a baby in the other arm, might I add! One thing I appreciated during our test drives was the large storage basket with front access. Carrying a diaper bag, snacks, and even a few groceries was manageable, and I didn‚Äôt have to fish items out from awkward angles. As someone juggling baby essentials and my own coffee cup, this feature quickly became indispensable.  

**Alternative Offerings**

Looking at its competitors, it‚Äôs clear that Britax aimed to deliver a balance between luxury and functionality. The Evenflo Pivot Modular Travel System offers slightly more lightweight and fold-friendly options for those prioritizing compact design, but it doesn‚Äôt quite match the sturdiness and safety features of the Britax system. Similarly, the Graco Modes Travel System has versatile seat configurations yet lacks the robust build of Britax‚Äôs steel frame.

For parents seeking premium safety, especially with the steel-reinforced car seat base and crumple zone, the Britax option truly stands out. That said, those who prioritize ultra-lightweight strollers or high flexibility in seat arrangements may lean toward alternative brands.

**Budget-Friendly Quality**

With travel systems ranging widely in price, this one offers commendable cost-efficiency. You‚Äôre essentially paying for peace of mind, thanks to its safety measures, alongside premium comfort and ease of use for both baby and parent. While some might view the price point as steep, it justifies itself through innovative features like SafeCenter LATCH installation, durable materials, and its machine-washable fabric.

I'm a former barista and shop owner who left the industry a few years ago. I'm also a tinkerer and I've been bouncing a few ideas around in my head for some things I think would be useful tools. 

1. A tamper that clicks on the correct amount of pressure. Think about it as the tamper cousin of a torque wrench, that gives you a haptic signal when you've reached the correct tamp pressure. 

2. Similar to the above, a tamp pad with a built in mechanical scale for watching for the correct pressure.

3. A forever kettle for pour overs. In my shop waiting for the kettle to be ready was always the slowest part of the process, so this would be a hot water tank with a hose and gooseneck spout that could be triggered by the barista. It could also exist as a hose/gooseneck attachment for existing water boilers.

So there you have it. In all sincerity, please tell me why these are terrible ideas that would never work :) ",1,1746024384.0,barista,4,1.0,False
1kbiapu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1kbiapu/jewish_dating/,Jewish dating,"Hello everyone,

I‚Äôm looking for some advice and perspective on a dating challenge I‚Äôve been facing.

I‚Äôm in my late 30s‚Äîstable job, financially secure, educated at a top university, tall, in good shape, and living near a major city. Overall, I do well with dating, but I‚Äôve consistently struggled when it comes to dating Jewish women, which is particularly frustrating because I‚Äôd genuinely like to build a long-term relationship with someone who shares my background.

Here‚Äôs the issue: on dating apps, I rarely have trouble getting responses or making plans with non-Jewish women. They‚Äôre generally open to meeting for coffee, drinks, or lunch‚Äîcasual first dates that I‚Äôm happy to pay for. With them, there‚Äôs usually a natural progression: we meet, connect, things often get physical fairly quickly (which is fine), but those situations tend not to last long-term as I‚Äôm still single, of course. With Jewish women, however, I often face vague communication, ghosting, last-minute cancellations, or a general unwillingness to commit to plans‚Äîeven when I offer to meet in their area and keep things low-key. It‚Äôs left me confused and a bit discouraged.

Some questions I‚Äôve been reflecting on:

1- Is this possibly an issue of motivation? I would assume that, like me, many Jewish women in their 30s are looking for marriage and children. Is this not true? 2- Am I approaching things wrong? I tend to avoid offering dinner on a first date‚ÄîI prefer something more casual to start and save dinner for a second meeting.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge how easy it is to fall into generalizations or frustrations that can come off the wrong way, especially online. I‚Äôve made a conscious effort to avoid any misogynistic thinking and writing/communication, but if anything I‚Äôve said sounds off, I‚Äôd appreciate the feedback. I‚Äôm genuinely open to learning and improving how I show up in this space.

Do your everything shower. Toss on a nice robe. Light your favorite candle. Spritz your favorite perfume on and relax at home. Make home the best place to be.


I'm maximizing this by:
‚Ä¢ Getting chickens. This gets me outside in the morning (in my robe and slippers of course) into the fresh air.
‚Ä¢ Making quality purchases and really thinking through them. If I don't feel I can afford or need to splurge at the moment, I let loved ones know it's on my wish list (we are a wish list family instead of a guess the gift family).
‚Ä¢ It also helps to go through all your things and write a list of what you don't need in your closet as well as a list of qualities of items you ten to donate regularly.
‚Ä¢ Coffee walks. Go for a coffee walk but make coffee at home. Pick out your own toppings. l've saved so much money but still feel so decadent with my whipped cream coffee in hand and enjoying a walk near my home in the morning.
‚Ä¢ Others have discussed this but l've been going longer between highlights, and began more deliberately setting aside a beauty budget.


I also did not love my home or love being home until we repainted and got different couch pillows. These purchases led me to spend less in the long run by enjoying being home more.


I understand my take isn‚Äôt relatable to everyone and their living situations (I live rurally and have a few acres, others rent or have HOAs etc) but l'd love to hear your take and thoughts on this.

1kbi92g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kbi92g/my_horrible_boss_is_the_reason_i_have_a/,My horrible boss is the reason I have a publishing deal.,"I‚Äôve seen quite a few awful, toxic work culture posts on here that always made me want to hug the posters - so I figured I could share my own toxic boss story, only mine has a happy end (of sorts!). 

Back in 2020 I got a job at what I thought was my dream company. I was a narrative designer (shocking that a gaming company was toxic, I know!/s) and I‚Äôd never done that kind of job before in my life but I had been writing some kind of stories since I was a pre-teen so I was super pumped to learn how to do narrative design and brought that energy into the office! 

For some reason, my unofficial boss and official mentor seemed to dislike me from the get-go. That‚Äôs completely fine, I‚Äôm not everyone‚Äôs type of ‚Äúbubbly‚Äù and I have ADHD so I know how that can come across as too high-energy‚Ä¶ Actually, it WOULD have been fine‚Ä¶ had she not let her personal feelings impact the work environment. 

I‚Äôll list some things she did, just because if I listed everything this would become another novel:

- I would ask her for feedback on my work, she would say everything looked good, then on the HR meeting she would say everything sucked and my stories didn‚Äôt perform well. When I asked why she didn‚Äôt suggest improvements, she made excuses like ‚Äúwell everyone has a different style‚Äù. When I said the other girl that joined the team a few months before me was getting suggestions from her mentor, she said that girl was a junior‚Ä¶ and I was apparently not? Don‚Äôt know how that made sense since I never did a job like that in my life. I was a copywriter before, very different skills.

- she told me I go to the bathroom too often and should count/time the minutes I spend in the bathroom and deduct them from my lunch break. I‚Äôm not even kidding. After that meeting (HR was there btw!) I shared with the HR that I have a health problem that caused me to use the toilet a few more times in the mornings. It absolutely never impacted my job as I‚Äôd stay longer to finish my tasks if needed. The HR said she understands‚Ä¶ but said that smokers also deduct time from their lunch break so I should do the same. (None of the smokers I talked to after that actually do that, and even if they did, it‚Äôs really, really not the same)

- I found this out after leaving the company, but she asked my coworker to write down on a piece of paper every time I got up from my desk to do anything (toilet, get coffee or water etc) and report to her at the end of the week. This completely explained why my relationship with my other coworkers was strained and non-existent. 

She spoke badly about me to coworkers, claiming I‚Äôm a liar and the way she came to that conclusion is: 

- she opened a document I edited yesterday and didn‚Äôt see the edits, (even though I had told her I finished them before leaving work). I went to check myself when she told me, and I could see the edits. She opened the document again and now she saw the edits as well. She claimed I lied and did ALL of the edits that moring‚Ä¶ it would have been impossible for me to do that. It took a full day to do those edits, I‚Äôm not a wizard! I even tried to show her the time stamps of when I suggested a certain edit. She refused to believe that perhaps, just perhaps, the program might have lagged and changes weren‚Äôt saved until I opened the document that morning. She told multiple people at the office I was a liar after that. 

- I drink coffee every morning, and I have a glass with water. We had no coasters in the office, so knowing I sometimes put the cup down with a bit too much energy (read: lack of attention) I always use a napkin as a ‚Äúcoaster‚Äù of sorts. One time, toward the mid/end of the day, I returned the coffee cup and kept my glass of water. She approached me asking me to throw the napkin away, that it‚Äôs disgusting I‚Äôm keeping dried blood on my desk‚Ä¶ I was like HUH? And then I realized a coffee spill was on the napkin. I chuckled and said it was coffee. She, of course, didn‚Äôt believe me because, remember, I‚Äôm a liar. So she also told the story of how disgusting I am for having dried blood (???) on my desk to others as well. Who knows how many invented stories there really were. 

I cried at least once a week at that job. Every HR meeting I needed to prep myself cause I knew I would be put down and likely cry when I left the meeting. I knew I was gonna be fired‚Ä¶ I mean it was obvious from all of the above. 

Last meeting we had, when I was let go, she told me ‚ÄúI just wasn‚Äôt good at this‚Äù insinuating I wasn‚Äôt that good at writing/conceptualizing stories. I could see the satisfaction on her face when she said that. 

I had been writing all my life‚Ä¶ so that comment that I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúgood at this‚Äù made me spiteful. 

And so‚Ä¶. I wrote my first book on the writing platform I found out about because of work - Wattpad (we sometimes hired writers for the games from that site). My book did‚Ä¶ surprisingly well. I started building a small readership base. 

Then I wrote my second book‚Ä¶ I decided to apply to a contest they held, and managed to submit my book literally 3 minutes before the closing deadline. The results came out and‚Ä¶ I was one of the winners! In fact, not just that - I won a prize!

A publishing book deal.

They wanted to PUBLISH my book in the USA! Mind you, I‚Äôm from a small European country and English is my second language. I don‚Äôt actually know of anyone who was traditionally published in the USA from my country, other than having their books translated and sold there after having been published here. 

So‚Ä¶ all I can say now to that ‚Äúmentor‚Äù is THANK YOU. Thank you for being the worst boss/coworker/person I ever had the displeasure of meeting. Thank you for mobbying me and making my days Hell. Before you, I had given up on my ‚Äúpublished author‚Äù dream and focused on ‚Äúmy real jobs‚Äù.

You being awful is the reason I wrote that first book. To prove how incredibly wrong you were, how much potential I had, and that I could write good, attention-grabbing stories‚Ä¶ and perhaps had you been an actual mentor that guided me and helped me be a better narrative designer none of this would have happend!

I would have used all of my ideas for the company games, and I would have never sat down and wrote a whole book (two books so far!).

Now I have a book releasing in August of this year (3 more months!), and it will touch American soil before I ever could (kinda cool haha). 

Initially I planned to include her in the acknowledgments as a sort of - thank you to my horrible boss and best motivhater. BUT as I was writing the acknowledgments it just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt feel right. I‚Äôd lost my dad a few months ago and having lost my mom as a kid a lot if the acknowledgments were about what this book means to me and what I wanted to convey to them. I thanked people who loved and supported me all along‚Ä¶ 

So it felt‚Ä¶ wrong, including her in any way. Like it would taint a section that ended up being very emotional for me to write. 

But, I‚Äôll definitely mention the experience in any interviews or videos and I‚Äôm also considering sending a copy of the book to the office with a ‚Äúthanks for giving ne the worst boss ever‚Äù message. 

Though I‚Äôm not sure I want to send my precious book into that toxic environment, haha. 

Anyway‚Ä¶ hopefully this post might have given someone inspiration or motivation to prove their toxic bosses wrong by just staying true to (and believing in!) yourself. ",8,1746024254.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.9,False

I met my girlfriend around December 2024, everything was going well except some issues with people from her past still being in contact with her (ex boyfriends or guys she had something short with) I had a conversation with her explaining it was a bit awkward to see her in contact with those guys, some of them would just text saying they were home alone if she wanted to go, she ghosted those messages.

After we had that conversation she cut contact with those guys and told them she had a boyfriend now, she explained those guys were people she tried to have something serious with but then they would say they just wanted something casual... she said to me she has never had a one night stand.

After that around February everything seemed to be going well again.

Long story short, last month she was sent to another city for four months due to her job. She got an apartment and went there to work. Last week she mentioned on Sunday she would meet up with a friend to which I obviously said nothing, however it made me think. She has no friends, just people she meets at work or uni but doesn't consider them friends. So it was confusing to hear she had a friend there. So I asked oh where did you meet this friend? She said she met him while she was living in our city of origin (where we met) but then the guy was relocated to that same city she is living in now, for work. That apparently happened around a year ago or less.

Anyways, Sunday came, she told me she was going to leave the apartment to hang out with her friend to go to a beautiful park there, the guy suggested that place apparently.

I have been cheated on in the past a couple of times so this situation took me back to those moments where I would feel a bit anxious and my gut was telling me there was something off. I did not panic and I just told her to enjoy her day.

She sent me a few pictures of the park and another one of some food they went to eat in a cute coffee shop.

She came back home and I asked, did you have fun? She said she really enjoyed walking around the park, the coffee and then the guy dropped her home. I had a feeling this guy wasn't really a friend, she has never mentioned me any friends so it made me think and I decided to ask. How did you met him?

She said they originally met in Tinder, they tried to have something but it didn't work out because she did not feel that spark or connection with him so they decided to just be friends.

I honestly could see that coming so I appreciated the honesty. I asked if they ever had sex and she said: Yes, just once but like I said after that nothing because I just did not get that connection with him.. it did not work out so we decided to be friends.

I said I needed time to process that information and she said it was fine and reminded me they are 100% friends and nothing else, she said she did not want to hide anything from me and I could ask any other questions and she would answer.

That shocked me a little, me personally I do not keep contact with my exes, not even with the ones I have dated for a couple of months so it's something that I cannot do. I feel like it is disrespectful to your partner to do that. That's just my opinion, I understand people think differently and that's why I decided to to post this here to read your point of view and opinions on this situation.

I would say that I‚Äôm pretty lucky, because I have a weekend shift job of 3 12 hour shifts - 6 AM till 6 PM, with a 20 minute commute each way. 4 days off a week.

But it‚Äôs still hard to get everything done, going to the gym every day for an hour (I‚Äôve tried different splits and shorter workouts ~ more days seems best), going to yoga once a week so my muscles don‚Äôt get tense, joining a run club for social atmosphere, trying to make friends because I‚Äôve fallen behind socially (and eventually a partner), keeping up with daily dishes/weekly laundry/keeping house picked up/bathroom clean, I am a writer and have told myself I only need one designated day for writing instead of daily, I enjoy going for 1 and a half walks when it‚Äôs nice out for peace of mind, and on top of it all some variation of rest: laying down/sort of napping, reddit scrolling for a bit, having morning coffee. Oh, and keeping up with mowing, and house maintenance (my water heater went out recently, so did my car). Occasionally seeing a movie, or going to do something fun like going to the mall, or to the city for some clubbing (very seldom get that chance though)

Forgot to mention making food. I meal prep 3 servings of something twice a week, eat out sometimes, I generally make eggs every morning for breakfast, and my third meal is usually a protein shake. Very simple stuff, but it adds to the list of things that I have to do


So, with all of this, do I have too high of expectations for myself? It seems like the most basic things everyone has (socializing, work, chores, maintenance, hobbies, gym), but I can‚Äôt seem to balance it. Any advice?

Yes the title is a bit provocative but I do need help.

I need some honest advice. I‚Äôm (24m) There‚Äôs this girl (21f) I‚Äôm friends with and I mean really good friends with. She‚Äôs absolutely stunning. Like, jaw-droppingly pretty. She‚Äôs super girly, always looking perfect, and has the sweetest, most bubbly personality. Every time I see her, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm living in a dream.

We hang out a lot shopping trips, late night talks, coffees, even just random drives. She hugs me all the time and when she does, I can smell her perfume and think about it for the rest of the day. I‚Äôm honestly borderline obsessed but in the most respectful way I just really, really adore her.

The thing is, I‚Äôm stuck HARD in the friend zone. I don‚Äôt think she has any idea how deep my feelings are. She talks to me constantly about other guys like guys she‚Äôs interested in, guys she‚Äôs gone on dates with. I‚Äôve even picked her up from another guy‚Äôs house before when she needed a ride home. It absolutely killed me inside, but I wanted to be the good friend she needed.

Just to be clear she‚Äôs never led me on or done anything wrong. She‚Äôs just a genuinely good person and friend, and it‚Äôs 100% my own fault for catching feelings. I don‚Äôt want this to sound like I‚Äôm mad at her or anything I‚Äôm not. She‚Äôs amazing and deserves all the happiness in the world, even if it‚Äôs not with me.

But I‚Äôm seriously struggling. Every little thing about her just makes me fall harder, and I‚Äôm terrified that if I confess how I feel, it‚Äôll ruin everything. I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll feel awkward around me and I‚Äôll lose one of the best friendships I‚Äôve ever had. On the other hand, staying silent is eating me alive.

And I want to be really really clear she‚Äôs not making fun of me or using me at all. She‚Äôs genuinely a good friend. She does thoughtful things for me too, like checking in when she knows I‚Äôm having a bad day, bringing me coffee just because, sending me memes she knows I‚Äôll like, and inviting me to hang out even when it‚Äôs just a chill night. It‚Äôs not one-sided she actually cares about me as a friend, and that‚Äôs what makes this even harder. And just to say I know how this probably sounds, but I‚Äôm not trying to be some typical ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù or a simp about it. I respect her completely and I value the friendship first it‚Äôs just hard when feelings get involved and I really am obsessed with her which makes it so hard when we‚Äôre so close yet so far.

Yes, we‚Äôll have an ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù - but I‚Äôm looking for something that feels less like a transaction and more like a real connection. The kind where we both feel seen, supported, and appreciated.

Outside of this, my life is really fulfilling. Im career oriented, but in my spare time I‚Äôm probably enjoying an Italian dinner w/ family, on a hike w/ my pups, hitting the beach in the summer, binge watching a show, or curled up on the couch (in oversized sweats) reading a book or writing my novel. I thrive on good energy & spontaneous adventures. If you like a woman who‚Äôs full of life, a little bold, and always ready to lift you up, hey..we might just click. Im a social butterfly, but I also get along with people who are more introverted. It would be cool to do this with someone who matches my energy, but sometimes the best connections are the ones where opposites balance each other out. 

Overall..I‚Äôm down to earth, low drama, and I like to think I bring something different to the table. I pride myself on being real and one of a kind. If you‚Äôve actually read this far, chances are you‚Äôre exactly the kind of person I‚Äôd love to hear from.

I have my post-Millenium Europiccola for 11 years now, have serviced it three times myself (gasket and roller replacement, mostly), no problems detected so far, still made perfect shots... until now.

I bought spares from Coffee Sensor, replaced tie rod gasket, piston gaskets and shower head holder gasket, additionally I installed a new shower head, new portafilter basket, new lever pins and roller. I also descaled the boiler. So far so good. 

Now whet I am trying to pull a shot, I pull the lever up, and nothing happens. Typically in 3-4 seconds the water should accumulate in the group head, so when I pull the lever down I should feel the resistance. This doesn't happen and when I pull down no water go through the group, no matter how long I wait (up to a few minutes), also there's no resistance to the lever whatsoever.

I don't even know where to begin looking for the problem's cause. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated (can't stand without my coffee for long!!) Ready to answer any questions if that helps.

First of all, ranches are just never making any money in the game because everyone just eats fish and grains instead. Whaling also barely gets to be profitable until the late game when it's basically a worse oil well with a little meat production added.

I would just add a game rule that 1.5s the meat demand, so roleplaying as countries like Argentina and Uruguay become more viable, and there is at least some wool used in the late game. 90% of all clothes weren't made of cotton in 1900, that's just daft. Also, maybe boost oil demand for heating the early game until the first 5 countries or so have invented pumpjacks, so whaling has a chance to be relevant.

Second of all, wine is still in a bad place. In an economy where wine coffee and tea are produced in equal measure, people will choose to only satisfy 8% of their luxury drink need with wine, which kneecaps production, which makes people demand even less of it, and so on. I demand justice for wine and if I choose to do it, I want to be able to play the game with wine on equal footing with the other two drinks.

There are probably some other zany things about the economy that people would like to change or are simply a matter of preference. Do you feel the same?",11,1746023080.0,victoria3,7,0.83,False

Tell us about all your great, not great, bad, whatever restaurant and recipe experiences you had in the month of April!

Personally:

**Davvero Gelato**: Alright, this place has blown my mind away since they've opened the shop. On separate occasions I've had the pistacho milkshake, ube milkshake (this past weekend) and the white coffee gelato that have all made me consider how lucky I was to be able to taste them. Just such a unique gem in Richmond that deserves way more love. They are expensive, but it's easily worth it and the incredients are as pure and real as one can get. Easily the best ice cream/gelato/whatever I've had in my LIFE!

**Brazen**: We went here for just dessert and had our minds rocked. The panna cotta was fantastic and had my wife smiling from ear to ear since she hasn't had a good panna cotta since we've moved here almost four years ago. The vegan baklava was MASSIVE and incredible. We left yearning for more and will actually be going back this weekend to try the full menu. 

  
**Memi's:** Tried this place for dinner before hitting Brazen for dessert. It was ... fine? Nothing spectacular and left a little disappointed since I had heard great things about this place. We had the falafel bowl and the koshari. They both felt like things we could've put together at home, which is never a great feeling to have a restaurant, and that includes flavor profile. Probably wouldn't be back anytime soon, but the happy hour is good and the fried eggplant appetizer we had was solid. 

  
**Global Fusion**: We went back after they recently opened back up for takeout and delivery after closing for a few months to focus on catering and it was just as mind blowingly amazing as it was before. Love the vegan options as well. I had the vegan southern reuben and man, did it hit the spot. Love them for some great sandwiches that hit the spot, such an array of options as well.

1kbhovk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kbhovk/aita_for_sleeping_with_my_step_grandmother_for/,AITA for sleeping with my step grandmother for money and exposing it.,"I have followed Charlotte for a long time, and watched like many the stories, and this is one I have always wanted to share.... I apologise for the length of this, but I have to try to explain things clearly. This happened a little while ago, I will change details so as not to be obvious, although some will know it if they read it and are from my hometown. But here goes. 

When I was 17 I worked in a hotel in my hometown. It is a tourist town with a lot of visitors. As a 17 year old at high school, my friends and I were all working after school and weekend jobs to earn money to buy cars.  We all helped each other out or followed employment opportunities that previous years team mates in our sports teams had done before leaving for university or full time work after High School. Yes I played a lot of sports and was quite athletic.  
Me, I ended up getting a job at a local hotel. I would help people with luggage, take their bags to the room, deliver meals, run errands sometimes, but mainly just waited for a bus to arrive and then work as hard as I could to get them to their rooms. The tips were often great, and sometimes paid more than the hotel.   
One evening I was asked to cover for a friend who had a late shift as he wanted to go see a band that was touring. I said yes, as he had covered for me many times. So Im sitting at the porters desk and the main desk calls requesting I go to the kitchen and take a room service order up to the room . I get to the room, knock and then after being asked to enter, I push the trolly into the room, I see the lights are dim, there is some quiet music playing and an older woman in a flowing nightgown that looks like a silk tent blowing in the wind as she is swanning around. She smiles at me and gets some money out of her cleavage to tip me, she then starts small talk and as you can imagine she alludes to sex and asks me my age, I say 17, then says how young men need to relax more, yes as you can imagine this was Mrs Robinson but with the awkwardness of watching someone eating raw onions on a date. She asked what we got paid at the hotel, I told her, she asked "" would I like to get that in one night, as well as a bonus "". I nodded, and well.... you can guess what happened. Lets just say, I was 17, def not a virgin but not very experienced , afterwards the front desk didn't notice me missing. hahahahaahaha If it was a by the minute rate you could say I was paid like a high profile lawyer.  I left with her whispering "" I hope we meet again""  
  
Anyway, the shift finishes, I go home and thats about it... I never see her again, and my friend later tells me its happened to him a few times, and the money is always pretty good. Shes regular there.  
  
Life goes on and few years later Im now in another city working and living my life while studying part time as my parents couldn't afford for me to go to University.  I found out my parents had been having marital problems as well as financial. My father had been having an affair with a woman for some time and she was now pregnant. So my parents were getting divorced. This devastated my mother. I would call her daily and even invited her to come stay with me to get away from everything. I loved my dad, but didn't feel good about how he had treated my mom. Mom declined, and said she wished I would get time to go home to be with her. Needless to say, Dad called me to say he was having a huge engagement party and would like me , his son to be there. He offerred to fly me home for it. I accepted, but only if he told mom he was getting remarried, and he had to do this face to face. He agreed, and as you can imagine, this was hard on mom at first. But she understood, he was going to be a dad, the child needed a father, and it also gave her the closure she needed, so she could move on. The closure was what I was hoping for, as she would make allowances sometimes about his behaviour, almost like denial so he could come back.  
I fly home on the Tuesday and everything is going great, I meet my future step mother at the airport, and they drop me to my moms and leave. She and I spend a few days together and she tells me about my fathers sleeping around, and how this wasn't the first, but it was the first pregnancy that he couldn't get out of. I didn't ask what she meant, but I understood. She explained it was partially why they had financial issues etc, and that she wanted more for me and wished she could give me that. I said the upbringing and love she gave was all i could ask for, and the rest was just bonus, and I was blessed to have her as my mom.   
Now to the party, this is where things got really crazy.  I didn't know anyone there except a friend ( I'll call him Paul)  from school. None of my fathers friends that I knew were there just Paul whom I had asked to go to the party with me. The party was posh, it was obvious that my step mom came from money, alot of it too. Paul and I  had not seen each other for a while and this was a great way to catch up on my fathers dime. Yes, we got drunk. Like, really drunk. Alcohol makes me very quiet and subdued, I don't often drink, but when I do, I become like a human teddy bear. I want to sit in the corner, watch people and just smile, like I am having an open eyed meditation. As I was with Paul and we had found a corner with a sofa, we sat drinking, refilling and drinking some more, while talking about life, my parents, work and who was married, divorced, who had kids, who was gay or str8, etc... you know, gossip that only 2 old friends would find remotely interesting ( keep in mind, Paul LOVES to gossip, this became apparent the next day ). Eventually the evening gets to speeches, and we are in the corner quiet and listening as people are talking. Then I hear a woman talking and she is talking about how although they are not married, the child was conceived with love, and how marriage is the most sacred of vows, and well, you get the picture, she omitted to say dad was married when they had met, that wasn't convenient. She then mentions how my father, this time around would be free from the restraints of a marriage that had held him back in life as he now had a woman who stood right beside him, as an equal and could bring to his life everything he had always wanted but never got. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, I felt like this woman has just told a room full of people my whole life was a just waste of my fathers, and my mom was why he wasn't more than he could be. I was not taking this. I was drunk, yes, but I was also insulted and all I could see why my moms tears and how these words would have crushed her, all the while this woman is burying the best years of our lives. I stand up and start walking to my fathers side to talk to him, he's smiling, and the woman finishes her speech. I say "" Dad, we need to talk"" he misheard me and thought I wanted to make a speech so he introduces me to everyone as his son who wants to say a few words and hands me the Microphone. Some people went quiet straight away and others clapped. I was not prepared in any way to talk. But here I was, so I start and try to be polite. I thanked everyone for their speeches, and how it was nice to see all of my fathers new friends, how living out of town meant we seldom go to be together and that it was nice he flew me home to be here and to see my mom. I then heard a woman quietly saying "" yes we paid for that dear, you're welcome"". I stopped,  I felt humiliated. I then tried to make a joke about finally he had bought me a round of drinks, and again this voice, said "" we paid for that too dear, and again you're welcome"" , a few people chuckled at this. I then said "" who are you ?"". She stands up and responds "" Im the mother of the bride and someone you will most likely never meet again"". Then it dawns on me who she is. I ask her, how important is the sanctity of marriage to her ? she says , its everything, and rambled on about a moral code that guides ones behaviour. Yes, she said "" ones behaviour"", I then asked if she was aware Dad and her daughter were sleeping together for the last 4 years while Dad was married ? She just glared at me with her "" How Dare You"" eyes...,  Dad grabbed me by the collar to pull me back, I hit his arm away and then asked her "" were you married when you paid me to sleep with you at the \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Hotel when I was 17 ?  My father grabs me around the neck, all hell breaks loose  while they're all trying to maintain their composure and dignity haahaha. My father now wants to kill me, my future now uncertain step mom is crying, people are all talking, the woman is just glaring at me and Paul is laughing his ass off as he has now fully slid off the sofa and is on the floor and I still have the microphone. People call security to have me thrown out, but before they came to get me I ask her if she still has a strawberry birthmark on her inner right thigh and  name tattoo'd on her chest. The security then grab me, and Im thrown out. Paul sends me a text to meet me out the front and then appears 10 minutes later with a couple of bottles of Champagne to celebrate. We get a taxi home, I tell mum it was an ok night, Paul and I sit up drinking Champagne and I tell him all about the hotel job, and how it was a common thing to happen and all of that before I pass out.

I wake up the next day, Paul has gone, and I feel fine, I switch on the phone, and it blows up. It was like someone said call or text this number for a million dollars, and everyone did. I turned the phone off and walk into the kitchen to get some coffee. To my surprise Mom and Dad were there (well I was surprised to see Dad) , Mom was chirpy, Dad wasn't. Dad was pissed. He asked me if it was true that I had slept with his future MIL, I said yes, and told him how much she paid me , and all that. I asked him why he allowed her to say that we were a waste of his life ? He said he had hoped I didn't hear that, as he had chosen to ignore it. Mom was confused by this and asked more, I just said ""Ignorant people Mom, ignorant people"". Mom asked me if I was ok about sleeping with this woman at 17, I then had to explain I wasn't a virgin, and it was ok. Later Mom made me breakfast and Dad left, well after alot of calm discussion.  
  
The fallout-  Dad said to not tell anyone about the night as MILs family were very well known and have a high profile in the city, they've been telling people it was all mistaken identity. I was apparently on some prescribed medication and drinking  when I shouldn't be. Mom said to let it all go for both our sakes ( she doesn't know the full extent of what was said, and I wont tell her) , so I let it go. I said I'd not talk about it and it was over. Paul didn't get the memo and shared it all in a private group chat with all our old school friends. YES, he's a gossiper. My future step Mom broke off the engagement, and is now doing shared custody with the hopes of reconciling sometime, they get along and spend time together and she's actually nice,  so now dad gets nothing at home, and continues to get nothing if he hopes to reconcile with Ex maybe step mom. I also have 2 little brothers, whom are great and I have a good relationship with . Mom has met a man ( Herb) and is slowly moving on, she has some trust issues but did confide in me that she hadn't felt so happy to hear about someone sleeping around as she did when she heard about my speech, and the woman, she's still rich and she still carries on as "" one should"" but she knows, people gossip and talk so her head isn't so high. Her husband did contact me privately to ask me the tattoo'd name and where it was and I told him the name, who it was ( apparently a child they had given up for adoption, as they couldn't afford to keep it, this was before they got wealthy) and that it was located above her heart and under her left breast, not visible without lifting. He then thanked me not mentioning any of this to anyone and for the restraint and discretion I had shown since the incident. He offered me money to pay for my school fees, but I declined it. He accepted this but said, if I ever needed anything, he was willing to help me. I asked him if he was ok with his wife sleeping around, and that I wasn't the only one, he replied, he wasnt ok about it, but he accepted it as she wasn't perfect but he loved her. 

So AITA  ? I will try to reply to questions, but understand, that I don't wish to re-ignite the shitstorm that this was at the time.  This is also my first ever Reddit post, and still trying to get around what it is.  ",11,1746022778.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,0.87,False

2: each cure is based on both coffee and gemstones.
3: the lead cure is a mermaid princess, their is a wheelchair bound cure, their are also two male cures.

But I have to make this clear.
 the main Cures Are only able to transform as a duo which is present in all three Futari wa seasons. Similar to Max Heart, the duo can finish off monsters together, however, this time there are actually two duos, the 1st one is female, while the other the male.
Any ideas on the colors, I do want either the lead or wheelchair bound to be red, and the punk rock male to be indigo. (I don‚Äôt want a yellow lead cure again) and the punk rock male cure is named Cure Kraken. 

Any other ideas ",1,1746022508.0,PrettyCures,2,0.67,False
