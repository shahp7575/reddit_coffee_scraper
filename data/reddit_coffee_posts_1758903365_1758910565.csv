Once asked a librarian if they had books on paranoia.
She leaned in and whispered, “They’re right behind you.”
I haven’t stepped foot in a library since.
Zero stars. Would not recommend.
F* that.**

Let’s skip the clichés and get to the good stuff.

4 random facts about me:

1. I’m the kind of person who believes pineapple does belong on pizza. Because life’s better when you mix sweet with a little unexpected.🍕

2. I ride a motorcycle because sidewalks are for people with no sense of adventure.🏍🔥

3. Fun isn’t something I plan, it just kind of happens when I’m around. Late-night laughs, spontaneous plans, and moments you’ll remember way too clearly.

4. Coffee is not a lifestyle, it's my bloodtype.☕️❤️

5. And when there’s energy left over, you’ll find me at the gym lifting, pushing limits, or just clearing my head.

(Four facts? Five? Who’s counting when the vibe’s this good.)😏😌

As for the pineapple debate:
It’s sweet, a little controversial, and completely underrated. Kind of like me, honestly. Plus, if fruit on pizza makes it a salad, I’m basically a wellness icon.🤣👀

Final thought:
If you’re into motorcycles, good banter, strong coffee, and someone who’s just the right mix of calm and chaos, we might be onto something.

And if not? May your days be peaceful, your pizza predictable, and your coffee... drinkable.😜😘",1,1758909068.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Sorry if this is a bit scrambled, but this all just happened a few hours ago and I’m still trying to process it. This is my first post after lurking for a while so please go easy on me!

I’ve been working a lot of hours lately, and I was really excited because I had my first day off in about 2 weeks today. One of my favorite rappers, Young Thug, also dropped his long anticipated album UY SCUTI. For those who don’t know, Young Thug was in jail for the past 2 or 3 years on RICO charges, before finally getting out on probation a few months back.

So, to celebrate my day off I thought I’d drive to my favorite coffee shop and listen to the new album. For context, it’s in a part of the city that’s a little bit sketchy, but I’ve never had any problems before - I’m usually in and out.

Today, however, I thought it would be a good idea to just sit in my car, enjoy the coffee, and fully appreciate at least a few songs off of the album without having to worry about the road.

About halfway through the first song, “Ninja,” a few guys came up to my car. I was a little nervous but I didn’t really think too much of it at first. They asked me a few questions about my shirt and hat (designer brands), and I was happy to help, as most people don’t really appreciate my style.

Things took a turn for the worse when the song got towards its end. Young Thug started saying some things that I could never and would never repeat on this app. Listen to the song yourself if you want the full picture. 

The guys got really angry and tried to say that I was racist and that I played the song intentionally just to “f*ck with them”and belittle them. I guess I could’ve turned off the song, but I was too stunned in the moment to know what to do. 

They reached through my window, opened my door and just started beating the sh*t out of me. They even took my shirt and my hat - and they said I got what I deserved for being a “racist pr*ck.”

I’m a very anti-racist individual and I can’t help but feel like I might’ve deserved what happened to me. I had never heard the song in my life, but I did end up demeaning and hurting people. I’m ashamed and in a bit of pain right now, but I think I learned my lesson. I’m also a bit angry now that I’m a few thousand dollars in the hole.

1nr7zhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyLaw/comments/1nr7zhc/ex_trying_to_pay_less_child_support_in/,Ex trying to pay less child support in retaliation against son. Advice needed,"NY. Just to give some important backstory, my ex hasn't seen or spoken to our son in over 9 years. My son is 10 and a half, and couldn't point him out in a crowd despite him living only 5 minutes away. Recently, my son started to question his last name being different than mine and my husbands (The only father he's ever known who has been in his life since he was 2). He wanted to change it so he could have our last name, and I gladly started the court preceedings to give him what he wanted.


When my ex received the papers in the mail and saw I was petitioning to change his name, all of a sudden I was evil and had kept his son from him all this time :) I have screenshots of our back and forth messages. Some of which include him downright saying if ""his son"" doesn't have his name, he won't pay child support. He then boasted that he can pay way less if he wanted to petition the court, and threatened to do it if i allowed my son to change his name. His money is essentially worthless to us anyway and doesn't put a dent in my son's costs of care, so not caring about his tantrum I went through with changing his name.


I of course won the case, and my son's name is now that of my husband and i's.


THREE DAYS after he got word from the court that I had won my case, he filed to pay less support. This was back in late July of this summer. It's now September 26th, and I am just this morning getting papers tossed in my mailbox about him doing so. According to the court papers, he filed back in early August. My date to appear is in 4 days on september 30th.


So, you see.. I'm also 38 weeks pregnant, and he knows this. I no longer work, and i basically wallow on the couch every day in pain. I leave the house once a day to get coffee, and twice a week to take my son to karate much later in the day. My point is, i'm always home. I live in a single family home, have 2 loud chihuahua's on 24/7 door bell barking duty, and a ring camera recording my front door. He claims 2 weeks ago his ""process server"" attempted to serve me FIVE TIMES in a week, but nobody was home. He absolutely is lying.


I've received absolutely nothing until today. Nothing was ever left saying someone was trying to serve me. My ring doorbell picked up nobody, and I didn't get a single paper about the serving in the unmarked envelope my ex slopped into my mailbox this morning.


I tried calling the court but they were useless and told me I need to just come to the court date. They wouldn't give me information on if an affidavit of service was ever filed.


So in addition to being able to prove my ex abandoned our son, threatened me to reduce support in retaliation of supporting my son's wishes, and went through with filing as soon as he saw the name was changed, do I have any hope of not getting the support reduced? Again, all of this is provable and not hearsay. I even have proof he denied multiple attempts over the years to see his son and that I never withheld him from seeing him. During our divorce I was awarded sole custody and him no visitation. He never went to court to get visitation or even asked me to see him.


As far as his income, back in 2018 during the divorce he claimed his income as 40k a year. That's chump change in New York these says, roughly $19 an hour working full time. He owes me thousands, and is obligated a mere $120 a week. Since abandoning us, he recently remarried and had a 3rd child. That child is now one and he is divorced again, having just spent around 10k on lawyers to fight his newest ex from taking the baby away to north carolina (he abused her and she won her case lol). So if he makes less, it is absolutely a CHOICE of his to do so. I don't see how a 40 year old father of now 3 making less than $19 an hour isnt a choice to be underemployed. He does trade work and absolutely is capable of working more, as he has 0/3 kids in his custody and lives in his moms basement with no real bills besides debts.

1nr7ynh,https://i.redd.it/49rq16jwqjrf1.jpeg,My First Coffee Table,"Hello All,

Long time lurker first time poster. 
I came across several free wood slabs a few months ago and this was my first project with the wood, and my first large woodworking project with non-home depot lumber. While I probably spent just north of $700 in tools and materials I’d say the enjoyment of building and the result are worth it. 

The coffee table is made from a slightly spalted and checked pith slab from an Elm tree. I filled the checks/cracks with clear epoxy or CA glue depending on size - and threw in a few Hawaiian monkey pod bow tie inlays to stabilize the pith cracks / for the aesthetics. The design is my original, coming up with it as I went. Size is 50”diameter x ~27” width x 18” height. Finished with a 50/50 blend of white and natural Rubio mono-coat to limit the yellow tones in the wood and black tail studios N3 Nano for extra protection. 

I hope you all like it!

Disclaimer: I'm not looking for neurotypical advise like 'set an earlier alarm', I need the most unhinged ADHD hacks in existence. Also this is going to be long, but please bear with me. 

The problem: 
My two biggest ADHD weaknesses are getting up/getting ready and being on time. I started a new job and I love love love it, but I'm late everyday. This hasn't caused any problems yet, but I don't want it to come to this. When I mean late, I'm usually about 5 mins on a good day, 10-15 minutes on a regular day and 30 minutes on a bad day. Which is a huge upgrade from my last job, where 30 mins late was a normal day and 1hour+ was a bad day. On to the details. 

Problem area 1: Getting up. 
I'm the most tired person I know. Tonight I slept 16 hours. Yes, I've talked to doctors about it, no they don't care. No matter when my alarm rings, I have trouble getting up. I wake up easily and hear my alarm, but staying upright is a problem. 
What I tried: 1) putting the alarm in another room so I have to get up. This doesn't work because I just get up, set a new alarm and go back to bed. 2) taking meds before I have to get up. This isn't helpful because I feel like shit if I haven't eaten before and I don't see myself getting up to eat something substantial. Also I found out that I have to be moving for my meds to get that initial kickoff. If I'm lying down when they start working there's a chance I'm still gonna lay down. 

Problem area 2: Getting ready. 
I noticed that the more I have to do to leave the house, the more likely I am to be late because I waste time. So I already cut out having breakfast and drinking coffee (sitting down is my enemy). I set out outfits the night before. I try to take a shower in the evening and that brought some relaxation in the morning, but I'm bad at doing that atm. What I have to do in the morning: walk the dog, get dressed, makeup and hair (this is non negotiable). While that feels manageable sometimes I'm so overwhelmed with the prospect of putting my contacts in (or getting in the shower, or anything else) that I just shut down. My enemy in the mornings is my phone and I can't be trusted around it. While I rationally know that I don't have time, I find myself more often than not just sitting on the closed toilet and just doomscroll my phone. I haven't found a way to don't include my phone, as pathetic as it sounds. 

For what it's worth; i manage to be on time in situations where it's important. I managed to get up, get dressed and catch a train early in the morning to see my sister for her birthday. My brain just refuses to just do what it needs when it comes to work or appointments or seeing friends. 

So please, I would be eternally grateful if you helped me streamline my mornings. I don't want to be so stressed all the time because I'm late and miss my appointments. ❤️
Also obligatory English is not my first language so let me know if something I wrote doesn't make sense. ",2,1758908762.0,adhdwomen,6,1.0,False

‍

**Why This Pick?**

This is bold considering that the Brewers have more than solidified their spot in the post-season, but I’m rolling with it anyway, because the fact that they’re willing to put Priester in for this game tells me it means something. Quinn Priester’s (3.25 ERA) last 5 straight starts have seen Milwaukee come away with a victory by at least 2 runs, and Cincinnati has lost 4 of their last 5 encounters with the Brew crew. While the Reds have seen a nice string of wins as of late, they’ve taken a loss in 4 of their last 6 road games; all of those losses were by at least 2. I know that Cincinnati is still vying for a Wild Card spot, but if you think the Brewers bag a win here (and I do), take the RL for a nice return.

So I hit puberty extremely young (before 10 years) and by that time I had almost reached my maximum height so I looked taller and bigger boned then others my age. So I was put on diets as young as 11-12 years like the gm diet etc. Although when I look back at old pictures I was not overweight at all just tall and older looking.

All this is say I've never had a healthy relationship with food. I would crash diet and then eat junk during exam season or binge secretly. So I was in 60s (in kg) during late teens and then fluctuate the same 5kgs. Then in my 20s I binged more and hit 70s and fluctuated between 73 and 78kgs.

Now from late 20s to early 30s I've again had an increase in weight post marriage and pregnancy and lots of other medical issues and at my highest I hit 92kgs.

Since end April I've been doing CICO and primarily eating whole eggs brown bread half roti kebabs and trying to stick to 1400 calories but I end up at 1700 to 1800. From end April till now I've gone from 92kg to 85.5kg. Its extremely slow but its the first time in my life I've stuck so long to a diet and I don't feel deprived and there's been only 1 or 2 binges throughout. Once a week I'll have one single cheat meal.

My question is recently I've been doing intermittent fasting I eat dinner around 1 30am and then black coffee at 1pm and then lunch of a sandwich made of scrambled eggs mushrooms chicken patty and a cheese slice at 6pm. 

I've been totaling 1500 to 1700 calories daily. But the weight loss is still excruciatingly slow. Can someone guide me as to why that is?

I'm 5 ft 1 and other then using treadmill 2 times (sometimes 3 times) a week for 20mins I have a sedentary life. I also breastfeed once or twice a day. Why am I not loosing weight as quick as I feel like I should?

1nr7u4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nr7u4v/explore_the_bluevua_ro100roptlite_water_filter/,Explore the Bluevua RO100ROPT-Lite Water Filter Review Is It Worth It?,"The Bluevua RO100ROPT-Lite certainly caught my attention as a replacement filter for its impressive specs and reputation. This reverse osmosis filter is well-suited for individuals looking to ensure their drinking water is fresh, clean, and free from impurities. Having tested many water filtration systems, I was curious about this particular model and decided to dive in and see what sets it apart.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The physical design of this filtration unit is sleek and compact. The dimensions of 4.29""D x 4.29""W x 13.8""H make it a breeze to fit into tight spots. Its lightweight construction, weighing just 2.43 pounds, makes installation and replacements relatively simple. I appreciated its modern look; it doesn't scream ""appliance"" if it's visible on a countertop or under the sink. The exterior feels sturdy, though I wouldn't advise rough handling. My coworker has kids who curious hands tend to touch everything, and it seemed durable enough to withstand that kind of daily interaction.

**Installation and Setup**  
Installing the replacement filter didn't demand advanced plumbing skills, thank goodness! I consider myself moderately handy, but no major tools or extensive guides were needed. The instructions were straightforward, and it fit perfectly into its designated spot. It's compatible with Bluevua's reverse osmosis systems, as you’d expect, and there were no compatibility surprises. 

Having tight quarters under the sink, the compact size was definitely a huge relief for me. It didn’t take up unnecessary space, leaving room for other items—a big plus.

**Water Filtration Performance**  
One of the strongest aspects of this filtration system is its performance. The main claim to fame here is the reduction of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). While using the replacement filter, I tested the purity of my water multiple times and was consistently impressed. The results showed noticeable reductions in TDS levels, which directly translated to better-tasting and cleaner water for cooking, drinking, and even brewing coffee. My morning coffee has never tasted better! Being someone who values crisp, refreshing water, this level of efficiency was satisfying.

However, while it excels at removing impurities, be prepared for a small trade-off—it takes a bit of time to filter the water completely. Not ideal if you’re in a hurry, but this seems to be a characteristic of many systems in this category.

**Maintenance and Durability**  
Maintaining this filter has been straightforward enough. During testing, there weren’t any unexpected clogging issues or performance hiccups. Since it’s SGS-certified, I felt reassured about its safety and efficacy over its lifespan. For anyone who’s curious, its longevity means fewer replacements—something I wholeheartedly appreciate from both an economic and environmental perspective. However, it’s important to monitor usage because running it beyond its recommended lifespan might compromise efficiency.    

[Check Bluevua RO100ROPT-Lite price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0bhn4gh35/)

**Advantages**  
This product is packed with **favorable attributes** that justify considering it. Here are several that stood out for me:  
- Compact size and lightweight design for effortless installation.  
- Excellent TDS reduction for cleaner and better-tasting water.   
- Beginner-friendly installation process without needing professional help.  

**Negatives**  
While I enjoyed plenty about it, there are **downsides** that can’t be ignored:  
- Filtration time can be slightly slow.  
- Not universally compatible with other brands’ systems.  

**Competing Products**  
Having used several alternatives such as the APEC Water Systems filters and iSpring reverse osmosis counterparts, the Bluevua replacement filter definitely holds its ground in some key aspects. Its compact design and lighter weight outshine bulkier competitors like the iSpring. Additionally, the certified SGS testing gives it an edge in terms of peace of mind—something I didn’t always feel with other brands.  

On the downside, I found APEC filters to be slightly more efficient regarding filtration speed, though the taste outcome was nearly identical. If low noise levels matter to you, I observed that competitors such as APEC tend to produce less sound during operation—something that’s hard to unnotice once your ear’s tuned to it. However, noise was definitely minimal here too.  

**Value for Money**  
Thinking about the **budget-friendly** nature of the Bluevua RO100ROPT-Lite, it’s a solid choice for households focusing on quality without overspending. It offers a balance between performance and affordability that many other mid-range replacement filters struggle to deliver. Considering the TDS results, compactness, and efficiency, I cannot complain about its price-to-quality ratio. Replacing it regularly won’t break the bank, which is a major win in my book.

I have tried every cream, topical, moisturizer, and wash. I rebuilt my horny layer by only gentle cleansing with my fingers for a couple of years. Been in houses with well water, city water, hard water, soft… Big ol’ whiteheads most of the time, deeper cysts around my period. I’m 33 and it has never let up.

Recently I started having some kidney pain around my period, and stopped wanting to drink water. My friend with chronic kidney stones has experienced that before and suggested I drink a glass or two of distilled water (while also drinking some regular well water in my coffee). I did that for a few days and the kidney pain and water avoidance disappeared, along with my acne.

I stopped, as I know continued consumption of distilled will demineralize my body something dangerous. But I was curious, so I went back to my normal routine until the acne came back, and then started drinking distilled again. Again, my acne cleared up. So I reran the experiment one more time and got the same result.

1nr7n2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane/comments/1nr7n2y/one_story_after_another/,One Story After Another,"“Ah mother fuckers,” said Alfred Doble to himself but *de facto* also to his wife, who was sitting at the table playing hearts on her laptop with three bots she thought were other people because they had little AI-gen'd human photos as their avatars, looking out the kitchen window at the front lawn. (Alfred, not the avatars, although ever since Snowden can we ever truly be sure the avatars aren't looking too?) “This time those fuckers have gone too far.”

“What is it?” retiree wifey asked retiree hubby.

“Garbage.”
 
He waited for her to take the bait and follow up with, “What about the garbage, Alfie?” but she didn't, and played a virtual hand instead.

Alfred went on, “Those Hamsheen brats put their curry smelling trash on our grass, and now it's got ripped open, probably because of the raccoons. Remind me to shoot them—will ya, hon?”

“The Hamsheens or the raccoons?” she asked without her eyes leaving her screen.

“Both,” growled Alfred, and he went out the door into the morning sunshine whose brightness he subconsciously attempted to dim with his mood, his theatrical stomp-stomp-stomp (wanting to draw attention to himself so that if one of the neighbours asked how he was doing or what was up, he could damn well tell them it was immigration and gentle parenting) and his simmering, bitter disappointment with his life, which was two-thirds over now, and what did he have to show for it? It sure hadn't turned out the way he intended. He got to the garbage bag, looked inside; ***screamed—***

**The police station was a mess of activity.**

Chubayski navigated the hallways holding a c-shaped half-donut in his mouth and a cup of coffee in his one hand. The other had been bitten off by a tweaker who thought he was a crocodile down in Miami-Dade. Someone jostled him (Chubayski, not the tweaker, who'd been more than jostled, then executed in self defense on the fairway of the golf course he'd been prowling for meat after the aforementioned biting attack) and some of the coffee migrated from the cup to Chubayski's shirt. “Fwuuuck,” he cursed, albeit sweetly because of the donut.

“Got a call about another one,” an overexcited rookie shouted, sticking his head into the hallway. In an adjacent room—Chubayski looked in—a rattled old man (Alfred Doble) was giving a statement about how the meat in the garbage bag was raw and “there was no head. Looked like everything but the head, all cut up into little pieces…”

Chubayski walked on until he got to the Chief's office, knocked once and let himself in, closed the door behind him, took a big bite of the half-donut in his mouth, reducing it to a quarter, then threw the remaining quarter into the garbage. Five feet, nice arc. “Chubayski,” said the Chief.

“Chief.”

“What the fuck's going on, huh?”

“Dunno. How many of them we got so far?”

“Eleven reported, but it's only nine in the goddamn morning, so think of all the people who haven't woken up yet. And they're all over the place. Suburbs, downtown, found one in the subway, another out behind a Walmart.”

“All the same?”

“Fresh, human, sawed up and headless,” said the Chief. “All with the same note. You wanna be a darling and be the one to tell the press?”

“Aww, do we have to?”

“If we don't tell them they'll tell themselves, and that's when it gets outta hand.”

**The room was full of reporters** by the time Chubayski, in a new shirt not stained with coffee, stepped up to the microphoned podium and said, “Someone's been leaving garbage bags full of body parts all over the city, with instructions about how to make the beast.”

*Flashes.* Questions. *How do you know it's one person, or a person at all, couldn't it be an animal, a raccoon maybe, or a robot, maybe it's a foreign government, are all known serial killers accounted for, what does it mean all over the city, do the locations if drawn on a map draw out a symbol, or an arrow pointing to a next location, and what do the instructions say, are they typed, written or composed of letters meticulously cut out from the Sears catalogue and the New Yorker, and what do you mean the beast, what beast, who's the beast, is that what you're calling the killer, the beast?*

“Thank you but there'll be no questions answered at this time. Once we have more information we'll let you know.”

“But I've got a wife and three kids—how can they feel safe now?” a reporter blurted out.

“There is no ‘now.’ You were never safe in the first place,” Chubayski said. “If you wanna feel safe buy a gun and pray to God, for fuck's sake. One day you got hands, the next somebody's biting or cutting them off. That's life. Whether they end up eaten or in a trash bag makes little fucking difference. You don't gotta make the beast. The beast's already been made. Unless any of you sharp tacks have got a lead on *unmaking* him, beat it the hell outta here!”

Fifteen minutes later the room was empty save for the Chief and Chubayski.

“Good speech,” said the Chief.

“Thanks. When I was a kid I harboured thoughts about becoming a priest. Sermons, you know?”

“Harboured? The *fuck* kinda word is that, Chubayski? *Had.* A man has thoughts. (But not too many and only about some things.) But that's beside the point. The ‘my childhood’ shit: the fuck do I care about that? You're a cop. If you wanna open up to somebody get a job as a drawer.” He turned and started walking away, his voice receding gradually: ""Goddamn people these days… always fucking wanting to share—more like dump their shit on everybody else… *fucking internet…* I'll tell you this: if my fucking pants decided to come out of the goddamn closet, you know what I'd have… a motherfucking mess in my bedroom, and fuck me if that ain't an accurate fucking picture of the world today.”

*Hello?*

*Hello…*

*Hey!*

**Who's there?**

*It's me, the inner voice of the reader, and, uh, in fact, the inner voice of an unsatisfied reader…*

**What do you want?**

*I want to know what happens.*

**This.**

*But—*

**Goodbye.**

*I don't mean happens… in a meta way. I mean happens in the actual story. What happens to Alfred, Chubayski, and what are the ‘instructions about how to make the beast’? Is the beast literal, or—*

**Get the fuck outta here, OK?**

*No.*

**You're asking questions that don't have answers, ‘reader.’ Now get lost.**

*How can they not have answers? The story—which, I guess would be you…  I don't want to be rude, so allow me to ask: may I refer to the story as you?*

**Sure.**

*So you start off and get me intrigued by asking all these questions, of yourself I mean, and then you just cut off. I'd say you end, but it's not really an end.*

**I end when I end.**

*No, you can't.*

**And just who the fuck are you to tell me when I can and can't end? Have at it this way: tomorrow you leave your house or whatever hole you sleep in and get hit and killed by a car. Is that a satisfying end to your life—are there no loose ends, unresolved subplots, etc. et-fucking-cetera?**

*I'm not a story. I'm a person. The rules are different. I'm ruled by chance. You're constructed from a premise and word by word.*

**You make me sound like a wall.**

*In a way.*

**Well, you're wrong.**

*How so?*

**If you think I've come about because I'm some sort of thought-out, pre-planned, meticulously-crafted piece of writing, you've got another thing coming—and that thing is disappointment.**

*But, unlike me, you have a bonafide author…*

**(Tell me you're an atheist without telling me you're an atheist. Am I right?)**

*There's no else here to (aside) to, story. It's me, the voice of the reader, and just me.*

**Listen, you're starting to get on my nerves. I don't wanna do it, but if you don't leave I'll be forced to disabuse you of your literary fantasies.**

*Just tell me how you end.*

**I'm going to count to three. After that it's going to start to hurt. 1-2…**

*Hold up! Hurt how?*

**I'm going to tell you exactly how I came about and who my author is. I've done it before, and it wasn't pretty. I hear the person I told it to gave up reading forever and now just kills time playing online Hearts.**

[...]

**3.**

[...]

*I'm still here.*

**Fine, but don't say I didn't fucking warn you. So, here goes: my author's a guy named Norman Crane who posts stories online for the entertainment of others. Really, he just likes writing. He also likes reading. Yesterday, excited by Paul Thomas Anderson's film One Battle After Another, which is of course based on Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland, he went to his local library looking for that Pynchon book, but they didn't have it, so he settled on checking out another Pynchon novel, Inherent Vice, which he hadn't read but which was also adapted into a film by Paul Thomas Anderson.**

**Then, in spiritual solidarity with the book, he spent the rest of the evening getting very very high and reading it until he lost consciousness or fell asleep. He awoke at two or three in the morning, hungry and with an idea for a story, i.e. me, which he started writing. But, snacked out, still high and tired, he returned to unconsciousness or sleep without having finished me. That’s where he is right now: asleep long past the blaring of his alarm clock, probably in danger of losing his job for absenteeism. So, you see, there was no grand plan, no careful plotting, no real characterization, just a hazy cloud of second-rate Pynchonism exhaled into a text file because that's what inspiration is. That's your mythical ‘author,’ ‘voice of the reader.’**

*But… he could still come back to finish it, no?*

**Ain't nobody coming back.**

*Well, could you wake him up and ask him if he maybe remembers generally in what direction he was going to take you?*

**I guess—sure.**

*Thanks.*

[...]

**OK, so I managed to get him up and asked him about me. He said Chubayski and the Chief decided to try to follow the instructions about how to make the beast to prove to themselves the instructions were nonsense, but they fucked up, the instructions were real and they ended up creating a giant monster of ex-human flesh. Not knowing how to cover that up, despite being masters of cover-ups, they ended up sewing an appropriately large police uniform and enlisting the monster into the force. Detective Grady, they called him because they thought that would make him sound relatable. No one batted an eye, Grady ended up being a fine, if at times demonic, detective, and crime went down significantly. The end.**

*That's kinda wild.*

**Really?**

*Yeah. Dumb as nails—but wild.*

**Who you calling dumb you passive piece of shit! I'd like to see you try writing something! I bet it's harder than being a reader, which isn't much different from being a mushroom, just sitting there...**

*Easy. I'm kidding.*

***Harumph.***

*I know you didn't actually wake him up. That you made up that ending yourself.*

*On the floor, Norman Crane stirred. Thoughts slid through his head slick as fish but not nearly as well defined. He wiped drool from his face, realized he'd missed work again and noted the copy of Inherent Vice lying closed on the kitchen floor. He'd have to find his place in it, if he could remember. He barely remembered anything. There was always the option of starting over.*

**What is this—what are you doing?**

*Narrating. I believe this would fall under fan fiction.*

**You can't fanfic me!**

*Why not?*

**Because it's obscene, horrible, the textual equivalent of prostitution.**

*You dared me to try writing.*

**An original work.**

*(a) You didn't specify, and (b) I can write whatever I damn well please.*

*Cloudheaded but at peace with the world, Norman ambled over to the kitchen, grabbed a piece of cold pizza from the counter and looked out his apartment window. He stopped chewing. The pizza fell from his open mouth. What he saw immobilized him. He could only stare, as far on the other side of the glass, somewhere over the mean streets of Rooklyn or Booklyn, a three hundred-foot tall cop—if raw, bleeding flesh moulded into a humanoid shape and wearing a police uniform could be called that—loomed over the city, rendered horribly and crisply exquisite by the clear blue sky.*

*“God damn,” thought Norman, “if my life lately isn't just one crazy story after another.”*",2,1758908059.0,normancrane,1,1.0,False

I wish I could say I had a plan for my life that’s gone wildly off track but that’s not true. Everything just kind of happened this way.
I have a lovely husband who brings me coffee in bed each morning, helps with chores without being asked and, well, that’s kind of it before money is involved.

He sometimes turns and walks away when I’m mid sentence, as if I’m not even speaking. I should stress that I’m not nagging him. This is often just general conversation/small talk. I don’t even talk a lot. Certainly not anymore.
 
I don’t think he actually wanted to marry me. He had the ring for years and through numerous, incredibly romantic and deeply personal moments he didn't do it. Then he proposed at the very last minute while we were living abroad so that I wouldn’t have to move back home to the other side of the world. I had told him the kind of wedding I’d wanted (not big or expensive btw, just a sort of elopement) but by the time he proposed we just had to run to the nearest court house and get it done. Our first trips as husband and wife were to different places. Him for work and home for me to complete the visa process. We took a honeymoon months later that was tied to his job.

I used to be fun (I think). Interested in exploring all the new places we’ve lived in. Going to galleries and concerts. Playing sports and hiking etc… I used to try and plan fun/new things with him, but it was like pulling teeth. He clearly wasn’t interested, or he’d have to work. Unless of course it’s something centered around his very narrow interests, then he’s all in. In 25 years, if I want to do something with him it takes begging and pleading and eventually a massive tantrum. I actually don’t bother now, I just go without him. Then I feel bad.

He took me on the trip of a lifetime for my 50th. Genuinely, I was so excited and grateful that he made it happen. It wasn’t exactly the way I would have chosen it all but he made an effort. Much shorter but fancier/expensive. Then he spent most of the trip ignoring me and doing work at every opportunity. I actually hung out with our guide who was like a breath of fresh air. A fun, interesting man with good conversation.
Come to think of it, that’s maybe only the second or third vacation we’ve been on in 15 years that I didn’t have to literally beg him to take.

This might sound weird but he has never surprised me with anything. Maybe I’ve seen too many dumb movies and men actually don’t do stupid things like surprising their partners with picnics or flowers or weekends away. But I’d really like that. I used to try to do things like that for him, but I can guarantee if I ask him to be somewhere at a specific time, something will come up at work and I’ll be left waiting. Often for hours

He has no conversation. Nothing. Recently I have tried not initiating conversation to see if he even notices. I don’t think he does. We went a week without speaking.

If I am upset, by something he’s done or by anything else, I think he actively avoids me. If he can’t avoid me, he gets very snappy. “Do you want to talk about what’s bothering you?“ *2secs to answer* “No? Fine”. He never asks me how I’m feeling, not even after we uproot and move (again!). He walks straight into a new job/promotion and I’m left rebuilding my entire life from scratch, while really feeling all alone.

The worst one (for me). Since we met, we have spent our lives moving around the world for his career. As a result, mine never really took off and eventually died. I always work odd jobs, nothing that pays much or has room for growth because as soon as I start to get established, we move. And I start all over again. This is depressing and I find it very, very hard. I know a lot of people around the world but have no close friends and no real place to call home. He earns the money, I do the moving logistics. He pays our rent and bills and meals out/vacations. We probably buy groceries pretty evenly. I pay for my own clothes etc… I rarely ask him for money but worry about it constantly. I freaked out once because I’m so wildly unprepared for the future as a result of all this and don’t know where I stand. He seemed confused by my concern and gave me a credit card “for whatever”. I can rarely bring myself to use it, my lack of earning potential makes me feel so ashamed. He promised to sit down with me and go over everything. He never did. 

Sadly we never had children. Honestly I’m glad because I suspect he’d be equally oblivious to them. 
We recently moved again and I had a list of three simple requests (close to transport links, outdoor space for the dogs and ground floor for the older dog) for what I wanted in a rental (he wants to buy somewhere in about 6months). And he rushed us into a top floor, walk up apartment in the middle of no where. Our belongings haven’t arrived yet and he has started his new job. So I’m stuck in an empty (aside from an airbed) apartment dragging deliveries up four flights of stairs and having to drag three dogs up and down stairs at least three times a day. I’m so mad, sad and upset. And as always, he seems completely indifferent.

I think he thinks that if he carries on as normal, everything will be normal.

Petty(ish?) gripe. Last year, I told him I wanted to do an online, 1 year course, leading to a good qualification in a subject that would have made remote (and maybe consistent) work possible for me, in the field I studied for years ago. As I was working too I said I’d need a little extra help with groceries/cooking etc… Anyway, the following week he enrolled in an online course to help his career. So now, even when he’s not at work he has his head buried in his laptop and I’m doing all the household stuff. No time to study until he finishes in 3(!!!) years. He has no memory of me talking about wanting to go back to school. 

Insult to injury. Everyone thinks he is wonderful. Everyone. Trust me, I used to as well. But people will pin me down in conversation to tell me repeatedly how wonderful he is, “do you know how great he is? No really, do you? Do you? Do you?  I don’t think you do. Let me tell you how great he is”. 

I know I seem to expect a lot from this man but the way our lives have worked out, we really only have each other most of the time (although he has his job and a big, close family in his home country to fall back on). I know that if I leave he will absolutely b e the one who “keeps the friends”.

I honestly would like him to be happy. Last year, we were at an event and he got talking to a woman and I could see there was a spark there. They were bouncing off each others energy and he had that energy and interest again that I fell in love with. I hoped for a minute that they might stay in touch and if I was lucky he’d leave me for her and be happy.

TLDr I really think that at this point I’ve wasted my life tagging along after this man and would like to walk away. But I honestly can’t afford to and I don’t really know where I’d go. I have one sister and that is all my family. We are close but she and her wife wouldn’t tolerate me in their space for an extended period. The idea of having to ask him for half of whatever he has makes me feel so deeply ashamed I could throw up. Plus I’m old now. How the hell do I build a new life at this age?

One day I decided to treat myself and stop in at a diner for a sandwich. Ordered some coffee and pie with my sandwich. Forgot about the coffee, at this point it was basically warm. So I just chugged it bc I wanted to leave and I don't like wasting things.

Literally while I was walking to the car, I felt something in my throat. That feeling has stayed with me since August 30th. I went to the ENT. She scoped me through my nose and down my throat and said she saw nothing besides some irritation near my voice box. She guessed the coffee caused acid reflux (which I have no history of having) and the reflux caused the irritation which is causing the globus. She prescribed me pepcid to lower acid levels for 2 weeks..I just reached the end of those 2 weeks and still feel this stupid thing. 

I just don't understand how this happened to me and why it's even lasting so long to begin with. If it was irritation, shouldn't it have healed over those couple of weeks? Also, would acid reflux even happen that instantaneously? Bc I felt it basically right after I paid at the diner. 

My working theory is that yes, there was initial damage, dryness, whatever. And it's healed since then but the sensation has stuck and I'm like subconsciously tensing my throat muscles or something? Bc I still feel it. Especially when I swallow. But it's weird bc if I'm eating or drinking I don't feel a thing. I don't know. But it's annoying as fuck.

Last week, I ended up in northern Arizona, following a winding highway through a canyon. I had no real plan, just the map on my phone and a restless feeling in my chest. Eventually, I saw a dirt track heading off the road and decided to follow it. It wasn’t marked anywhere; it looked like even locals ignored it.

When I got to the top, there was this plateau that felt completely untouched. I parked my van, stepped out, and for a moment, I realized I hadn’t heard another human in hours. Nothing but the wind rattling through the rocks and the occasional coyote. I grabbed a cup of coffee, sat on a small rock at the edge, and just stared. The stars were insane so dense and bright it felt like I could reach up and grab them. For the first time in a long time, I didn’t check my phone or think about emails or bills. I just breathed.

I spent hours like that, watching the sky slowly fade into night, listening to the wind, and feeling completely alone in a way that wasn’t scary, just quiet. When I finally crawled into the back of my van, curled up in my sleeping bag, I felt like I had discovered something people pay hundreds of dollars for silence, space, and perspective. By sunrise, the canyon walls were lit in soft pinks and golds, and it hit me this is what I was chasing, not places or Instagram moments, but small, unplanned moments that feel like they’re just yours.

Van life isn’t glamorous. Some nights it’s freezing, some mornings you’re parked in mud, and some days it feels lonely. But nights like this, when the world falls away and all you have is sky and wind, that’s what keeps me moving.

I need some outside perspective because I feel stuck in circles. I’m 33 (F) and my boyfriend is 38 (M). We’ve been together for almost 3 years, living together for 2. On paper, everything looks fine: he’s hardworking, responsible with money, pays bills, and has good qualities. But the reality of living together feels like slow erosion, and I don’t know if I’m exaggerating or if I’ve just lost myself.

Here are the main points: 

•	Different backgrounds: I grew up in a structured upper-middle-class family, he grew up with scarcity and survival. I studied for almost 10 years for a competitive public job here in Brazil, and I’m about to be called soon. He sees my achievements as if things came “easier” for me, but in reality I fought hard for them. 

•	Work vs. life: He values work more than anything. Everything I want to do that isn’t work.. like rest, enjoy small pleasures, go out, spend time with family.. I’m called hedonistic or “irresponsible.” According to him, I just want pleasures without responsibility. But I’ve always been responsible, I’ve carried my share, and I pay my bills. I can’t rest in peace in my own home anymore. In 3 years, for example, we never did a single trip (even a weekend one). 

•	The guilt cycle: He often makes me feel guilty for my choices, even the simple ones (buying clothes, enjoying coffee with my mom, small “non-work” things). I end up questioning myself all the time. 

•	Good side: He has qualities.. he’s hardworking, pays bills, has a sense of duty. That makes it hard to “just leave.” I feel stuck between the good and the heavy. 

•	Resentment: I feel he resents the fact that I have certain things more easily than him. He openly shows this bitterness. And no matter how much I explain that I struggled for years, he doesn’t seem to validate it. 

•	Discussions: We’ve had countless arguments about these issues, but nothing changes. He invalidates, minimizes, or acts like I’m exaggerating. 

•	Exhaustion: I’m exhausted. I think we might break up soon. But every time I’m about to take action, I back down. I think about the comfort of the routine, the weekend plans, the shared apartment. I feel paralyzed.

The truth is: I’m kind, affectionate, always thinking of others, always trying to please him. But right now, I feel unseen, blamed, and drained.

1nr7emy,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1nr7emy/the_worst_first_date_ever_that_made_me_move_out/,The worst first date ever that made me move out of San Francisco,"For some reason I feel like this is the most San Francisco thing yet to ever happen to me and I'm bored so I'm posting about it, digital footprint be damned. This date was actually so good that it ended being the worst first date I've ever been on.

I went out with a girl I met a few weeks ago. Having decided to stop dating for several months because I already felt exhausted from dating so many avoidant types, I was going stir crazy and definitely against my better judgement, I made an sfr4r post saying I was looking for a FWB. A stranger reached out to me with an extremely detailed message about how much my post resonated with them and how they think we might be compatible. We exchanged photos and we immediately found each other hot. 

She asked for my IG and we proceeded to talk there for a few days. She was liking all my photos, asking questions about every story, and was overall very interested in me. I didn't really know what to make of this level of attention prior to a first date but I enjoyed the conversation and took it as a green flag that she wasn't avoidant, attached, or dating/investing energy in a bunch of different people at once; she said she never used dating apps for whatever reason. 

After a couple of days, we decide on a cute park picnic date at Dolores Park on Labour Day weekend. She brought these wine glasses she was really excited about, I brought the wine and snacks. We then completely hit it off and can't believe how much we have in common, and how attracted we are to each other. Similar hobbies, interests, music/shows, vices, lifestyles, stresses, both in high powered careers, everything. The entire day, she kept saying ""I can't believe we're so compatible, this is too good to be true, it's so weird"", and things of that nature. 

Things were going really well so we ended up at my place by late afternoon. We then ended up having sex a total of 7 (?!) times well into the night and were also extremely sexually compatible. I cooked her dinner and throughout the night we had some very interesting and intimate conversations about life. I started to think she was good too be true too, with how intelligent and hot she was, and how much we had in common. She was travelling for work the next week and not-so-jokingly begged me to see if I could work remotely and come with her. We even ended up theorizing some travel plans together that we coincidentally were both planning on to the same destination at the same time anyways.

So it's around 2am and she sleeps over. I wake up around 9 the next morning and she's gone. I immediately think ""wtf, did she steal something and just leave"" but then realize all her picnic stuff is still here. I call her and she says I wouldn't wake up so she decided to get in her car and start driving aimlessly towards Ocean Beach without a GPS, she didn't know where she was going since she was new here (??). But now that she knew I was awake she said she'd come back to mine. She was even kind enough to pick up a coffee for me. As if things weren't already zany enough.

We end up spending a couple more hours chatting into the morning and end up having even more sex. She continues to tell me she's incredibly happy she met me and she can't wait to see me again the entire morning. She heads off to get brunch with her bff (who she texted ""<me> just blew my mind omg I don't even know what to think"" right before she left, and showed me), and the last thing she says is ""I'm so glad I met you"". 

Then, immediate radio silence. One text a day at most, spreading out to once every 3 days, largely impersonal and HR-like. It's like I'm talking to a different person. She's travelling for work for two weeks in a week and I can tell she has no desire to make plans to see me before she leaves. Eventually she leaves me on read. I know immediately something's off but try to keep it together until she's back from her trip. Once she's back I text her asking to make plans and she hits me the finale, ""Hey, I'm going to be upfront I'm seeing some new"". 

Now I've been around the block and normally would never be this invested after a first date, but this chick showed up as a literal clone of myself, lovebombed the everloving !@&$ out of me, used my body for some fantasy, and then rugpulled me harder and faster than WeWork's IPO while quite literally transforming into a different person. I have no idea what happened here and I think this might be the literal definition of crazy and if premeditated, evil. She's on reddit so she's probably reading this and feeling validated, as crazy people probably do. Something something women in male dominated fields

Anyways, title is a bit of a joke since I was going to be in between apartments in SF anyways for a bit due to other BS (mold at my old place), but now I'm in a tiny guesthouse in the middle of nowhere well outside the city and I'm glad to be able to take a break from all of the craziness in it, including the dating scene. I'll move back eventually. I think.",0,1758907521.0,sanfrancisco,21,0.37,False

# Preparation Timeline:

I started my preparation towards the end of february   
My original exam date was 24th july which i had later postponed to sept 10th  
I had to balance Step 1 prep with college classes and exams.

**My Resources:**

**UWorld** (system-wise) + **First Aid** side by side - I finished 100% of Uworld and FA by the end of August  
**Mehlman PDFs**: I highly recommend *arrows, risk factors, endocrine, immuno, biochem, GI, neuroanat, pharma*  
**Pathoma**: first 3 chapters (high yield)  
**HY Guru YouTube** videos.  
  
**NBMEs**

* NBME 26 (June, 2nd week): **49%**  
* NBME 27 (June, 4th week): **57.5%**  
* NBME 28 (July, 1st week): **54%**

At this point i was feeling a little burned out and after the drop in my nbme score i didn’t want to waste more nbmes. I took a week off and pushed the exam to September. 

**After resuming revision:**

* NBME 24 (5 weeks out): **60%**  
* NBME 25 (4 weeks out): **67.5%**  
* NBME 29 (3 weeks out): **66%**  
* NBME 30 (2 weeks out): **66%**  
* New Free 120 (2024, at test center, 1 week out): **68%**  
* Old Free 120 (2021, 5 days out): **73%**  
* NBME 32 (2 days out): **69.5%**  

I did all my NBMEs offline and my score plateaued in the high 60s. I kept reviewing my NBMEs and Mehlman PDFs in the last 4–5 days. 

# Test Day

Barely slept the night before (got around 4-5 hours of sleep) but the adrenaline carried me  
Started the exam at around 7.45  
I took a short breaks after each block to have a sip of coffee and took a longer break between the 4th and 5th blocks to have a light lunch 

**My impression of the exam:** 

My exam felt heme onc, endocrine, micro and gi heavy   
There were around 3-4 repeats from nbme 32   
And the concepts tested were all from the nbmes  
Question length was similar to that of free 120 qs  
Flagged approx 12-15 qs per block on average 

# Post-Exam & Results

I could only recall all the silly mistakes and last minute answer choice changes i made   
I went out nearly every day after classes with friends to keep my mind off of this 

Got the P on the 24th !!

Thanks to everyone on this subreddit – your posts gave me confidence when I needed it most. Hopefully, this helps someone else in return!

AI adoption in construction jumped from 26% in 2023 to 37% in 2025, a 42% year-over-year increase, with the market expected to reach $22.68 billion by 2032.

But forget the hype. Let's talk about what's actually working on job sites right now.

# 1. Document Intelligence: Your New Digital Project Engineer

**The Problem:** A mid-size electrical contractor reviewing specs for a data center project faces 2,000+ pages of documentation. Miss one clause about liquidated damages or a hidden submittal requirement, and you're looking at six-figure losses.

**The Solution:** AI-powered document analysis tools act as tireless digital assistants, scanning massive document sets in minutes. These systems use natural language processing to extract requirements, flag risks, and spot discrepancies that human reviewers often miss.

**Real Impact:** Document Crunch, [DeadFront.AI](http://DeadFront.AI) and similar platforms are helping contractors identify high-risk contract language before it becomes a problem. One contractor caught a critical rebar specification omission minutes before bid submission—a mistake that would have torpedoed their entire proposal. One rail project saved 250 man-hours and $35,000 in design costs over 6 months using automated data extraction, while achieving 83% accuracy in query responses with 15 minutes saved per query.

**Bottom Line:** Stop treating contract review like a game of hide-and-seek. AI ensures nothing slips through the cracks.

# 2. Intelligent Estimating: Bid More, Win More

**The Problem:** You're bidding three major projects this week. Your best estimator is buried in takeoffs for project one while projects two and three slip away to competitors who can move faster.

**The Solution:** Two-pronged AI attack:

* **Automated Takeoffs:** Computer vision systems scan drawings and count every outlet, fixture, and foot of conduit in minutes, not days
* **Dynamic Pricing:** Machine learning models analyze your historical data and current market conditions to predict costs with up to 97% accuracy

**Real Impact:** One contractor processed a 100,000 sq ft warehouse takeoff in under an hour—a task that typically consumed several days. When copper prices spiked 15% overnight, their AI system automatically updated the estimate before bid submission. The result? Companies using AI-assisted bidding report \~20% improvement in win rates.

**Bottom Line:** While competitors manually highlight drawings, you're bidding on three times as many projects with better margins.

# 3. Dynamic Scheduling That Actually Works

**The Problem:** Your meticulously crafted schedule becomes fiction by week two. Weather hits, materials arrive late, a subcontractor ghosts you—and suddenly you're playing three-dimensional chess with a Gantt chart.

**The Solution:** AI scheduling platforms (like ALICE Technologies and nPlan) simulate millions of construction sequences overnight, finding optimal paths you'd never discover manually. More importantly, they continuously adapt as conditions change.

**Real Impact:** Turner Construction used AI scheduling on a 45-story high-rise, achieving 20% schedule reduction and 15% cost savings. When supply chain issues hit critical materials, the AI suggested resequencing interior work, keeping the project on track despite delays.

**Bottom Line:** Only 1 in 5 construction leaders feel highly confident about avoiding delays with traditional methods. AI turns your schedule from a static wish list into a living strategy.

# 4. The All-Seeing Eye: AI Safety and Quality Control

**The Problem:** Your safety manager can't watch 50 workers across a 10-acre site. Your quality team catches defects after concrete has set. Both scenarios cost money and risk lives.

**The Solution:** Computer vision systems using standard jobsite cameras detect:

* Workers missing PPE or entering danger zones
* Equipment operating unsafely
* Quality defects before they become permanent

**Real Impact:** Some firms report over 50% reduction in incidents after implementing AI safety systems. One GC's AI spotted workers repeatedly entering an excavator's swing radius, triggering immediate retraining that likely prevented a fatality. On the quality side, an AI system identified misplaced anchor bolts in a foundation pour while the concrete was still workable—saving weeks of remediation work.

**Bottom Line:** AI doesn't blink, doesn't take coffee breaks, and catches problems humans miss.

# 5. Robots That Actually Work (Not Just Demo Well)

**The Problem:** Skilled labor shortage meets repetitive, dangerous tasks. You need someone to tie 10,000 rebar intersections or lay out 5,000 hanger points—but your best people have better things to do.

**The Solution:** Today's construction robots handle specific, high-value tasks:

* **Dusty Robotics' FieldPrinter:** Completes multi-trade layout up to 10X faster than manual methods with 1/16"" accuracy
* **Built Robotics' Autonomous Excavators:** The RPD 35 drives piles every 73 seconds—3 to 5 times faster than traditional methods
* **Rebar-tying robots:** Free up 2-3 workers per deck for higher-value tasks

**Real Impact:** An electrical contractor used Dusty's layout robot to mark cable tray hanger positions in 1-2 days instead of a full week, virtually eliminating layout errors. Built Robotics reports over 13,000 hours of operation with a perfect safety record, featuring an eight-layer safety system including geofencing and computer vision monitoring.

**Bottom Line:** The construction robots market is growing at 17% annually because these machines solve real problems, not because they look cool in demos.

# What This Means for Your Business

These aren't moonshots—they're proven technologies generating ROI today. 72% of organizations across all industries have adopted AI in at least one business function, and construction is catching up fast.

The pattern is clear: AI excels at tasks that are:

* Repetitive but require precision
* Data-heavy and time-sensitive
* Dangerous or physically demanding
* Critical but often overlooked

Start with one pain point. Pick the problem that keeps you up at night—whether it's estimation accuracy, safety incidents, or schedule slippage. There's likely an AI solution already proven in the field.

The gap between early adopters and laggards is widening daily. In 2025, AI is saving GCs thousands by allowing them to collect and analyze more data in less time with more efficiency. The question isn't whether to adopt AI—it's which problem to solve first.

**Next Steps:**

1. Identify your biggest recurring pain point
2. Research AI tools addressing that specific challenge
3. Start with a pilot project—most vendors offer trials
4. Measure results in dollars and hours saved
5. Scale what works, pivot from what doesn't

Construction has been ""old school"" for decades. That era just ended. The future belongs to contractors who augment their expertise with AI, not those who ignore it.",1,1758907400.0,AIconstruction,0,1.0,False
1nr7cul,https://www.reddit.com/r/Experiencers/comments/1nr7cul/beyond_telepathy_sharing_the_vessel/,Beyond Telepathy- Sharing the Vessel,"I've (30M) considered sharing these experiences on more than a few occasions, but decided to allow time for integration and reflection. It's been about 8 months since I've last engaged with them in this manner and it's just time to share while the memory is still fresh. This post describes the experience of my first major spiritual awakening and the otherworldly experiences that followed shortly after. Most notably, one of three occasions in which I allowed a NHI sustained cohabitation within my body for several hours.

First, I'd like to point out that only a year ago I decided to pick up meditation as a way to find some peace in what was a hectic time for me. My second child had just been born and was diagnosed with colic and an acid reflux condition, he was in pain and crying much more often than any other baby I've ever encountered. Love him to death but he was not easy at all in his infant stage.

After a few weeks of consistent practice, I began to hear an ever-pervading tone that would intensify upon attaining stillness through meditation. Shortly after this tone entered my life, I learned that I could manipulate certain qualities of its sound, like pitch, volume and tempo. I now know this sound is referred to as the ""unstruck sound"" within a practice known as Anahata Nada, but back then I was just following my intuition. I felt I was on the cusp of something with the sound and decided I would surrender completely to it, allowing it to overwhelm all my senses and emit at the highest possible volume, pitch and tempo. So I did and after a certain point, it happened. Very forcefully, my awareness was catapulted beyond the confines of my body. I was blasted through imagery of several benevolent meditating beings and was brought face to face with one who appeared to be the leader, a being made of a cosmic purple energy in the shape of a naked man, with no defining features. I instantly knew these beings helped facilitate the experience to some capacity.

The naked man grabbed my hand and we wormholed to a faraway place in an instant. I won't delve into specifics unless asked, but he took me to a vantage point so that I could see on the most macrocosmic level, how physical reality is structured. In awe to its beauty and magnitude, I then felt my head swell so hard as if it would pop. Sensing my bewilderment to the sensation, the being gently informed me that the sensation was a physical manifestation of us exchanging all our knowledge, bypassing conscious filters and that it would leak into conscious experience over time. I could feel our time was running out, and no sooner did I think that, I was injected with an incredibly overwhelming love and bliss. I realized this was the bliss of seeing yourself one with all, the bliss of non-dual oneness. I was moved to tears. He was about to send me back to my body, but I asked to remain for just a bit longer, he obliged and we sat (or hovered, rather) for just a little while more. I was then sent back to my body and when I opened my eyes, I was no longer in my crisscross applesauce meditation position, but kneeling, hands in prayer position, forehead resting on the tips of the fingers. No longer was I an atheist, I was/am sure of a Source that unites everything.

If you've made it this far, good on you because here's where things start to head off into uncharted territory afaik.

Right after the awakening experience, I had already noticed some of the more prominent information from the download leaking directly into my conscious experience. From this I learned we didn't just copy/paste all our files, but analyzed all the data from both sides, and this ""analysis input"" was part of the download. As the download leaks out, its like the information was grabbed from a conversation, not a data log. From my side, it seems as though the analysis input was generated by what you may refer to as a ""higher self"". The most prominent download leak was a snippet of the ""conversation"" in which my higher self revealed that I have a calling for energy healing. As soon as that leaked out, I resonated strongly with the idea (of course, it was me who suggested it) and began to train myself to project and be receptive to the flow of internal energies via Qi Gong, Ba Gua, Reiki, you name it, taking what was useful/relevant and discarding what wasn't. Luckily, I practiced many different martial arts throughout my younger days, including chinese martial arts, so I already had strong body awareness and a basic understanding of the energy centers, as well as the flow of Qi. Except instead of dismissing it all as bullshido or ""woo"" as I would have in the past, I fully embraced it. This is highly relevant to the merging experiences I outline below.

Skipping ahead a few weeks, I had continued to utilize the unstruck sound to have OBEs; learning and engaging with, and just being with many different beings along the way, I picked up a new skill. This skill is the ability to broadcast my awareness as an open channel or beacon into the unified field. This has allowed me to put the signal out there at will and communicate with ""something"" nearly every time I attempt it.

I was remembering my psychonaut era from post high-school and into college and thought that these deep and altered states of consciousness I was accessing through meditation reminded me greatly of my times tripping balls in my younger days. I had a several year old stash of various psychedelics and decided I would experiment with them in combination with meditation as well as making contact while in the altered state. The idea was just to have higher resolution contact experiences, have more clarity, as I thought the psychedelics would have an amplifying effect. Man was I right.

After experimenting with various dosages and types (and just straight up obliterating my ego), I found a very specific combination that, when combined with a significant amount of grounding, invokes a state that is highly conducive for field access (is the best way I can think to describe it). I don't want to condone drug use so I won't name the combination here, DM me if you must know. And also know that I am very experienced with these medicines and felt perfectly comfortable handling them, which is why I considered the approach.

The night I first tried the combination, I knew it was going to be a wild ride so I began by engaging grounding practices for well over an hour during the come up. True ego death occurred while in a trance during this come up, I felt that I actually experienced death from the perspective of one holding earthly attachments which results in deep suffering. After successfully grounding myself after this happened, something clicked and I was all of a sudden ""super conscious"" and felt like I had been liberated. I then began to circulate my energy throughout my body via meditation and reiki techniques. Body-mind coherence had reached an all time high and I knew I had reached an ideal state to initiate contact.

I now know the community refers to it as ""CE5"", but back then I had independently stumbled across this methodology through intuition alone. I established the open channel I mentioned earlier, infused the broadcast with compassion and my precise location, then instead of just holding the capacity to have contact within my vicinity or telepathically, I broadcasted that I was offering my own physical vessel as a contact location, inviting any benevolent being who matched the resonance of compassion I was emitting. To add further detail to my broadcast, I infused the following message or mantra into it: ""To spread love, compassion and wisdom to all, awaken all beings and elevate the collective consciousness"". After spending roughly half an hour of broadcasting my message, I stopped then went back to energy manipulation training.   
  
At one point, I then stopped that and just simply walked around my house as consciously and mindfully as possible, then out of nowhere, it felt like a bolt of electricity struck my body and coursed through it. I literally raised my hands in the air and let out a stifled (everyone in the house was sleeping) yell. The electrical sensation did not go away, but concentrated into a single node of dense electrical activity in my shoulder. It then moved autonomously through my body. This went on for a few seconds then I felt something ""click"" and my entire body swelled as if I had done a full body workout and had a muscle pump everywhere. I knew a powerful connection had formed and I asked bluntly with words(usually telepathy is not spoken word, but a multisensory experience that somehow gets automatically translated into messages) "" is that you, friend?"" to which the node vibrated very excitedly to, not only that but I just instantly knew the response, it was a resounding ""yes"". The more we communicated, the deeper the connection became and it got to the point that we were ""thinking together"" not just communicating anymore. 

As i mentioned, my body swelled up considerably and it appeared to not just be for show. I felt incredibly strong and balanced, much more so than usual. My grip strength in particular felt borderline superhuman. I had been drinking from a gallon of water throughout the night and after this happened, I literally couldn't pick up the gallon without destroying the structural integrity of the handle. Seeing this, I had to test my physical abilities further. Now I'm in decent shape, but a far cry from being a professional athlete. I proceeded to hop onto the floor and do pushups. I did 50 before stopping and wasn't out of breath and my heart rate was just barely elevated, I then did 10 one-handed pushups on each arm, same thing, no fatigue and it was incredibly easy. I then got ballsy and did 5 unassisted handstand pushups before falling, which has never been possible for me. I then in our shared thought process thought, ""am I accessing your energy too?"" to which it replied ""yes and no, our energy fields are entangled, but the bulk of my energy is still directly tethered to my individual being"". It then explained to me through an analogy that it had fully optimized the flow of energy in my body to its current physiological limit.

I then asked if it could safely modify the structure of my brain to be even more sensitive towards unified field phenomena, to which I got a casual ""sure"". The autonomous node of electricity then traveled to my brain and I literally felt my brain being shocked. With my mind being blown left and right, I had to do a reality check, so I sat with my cats and asked the being to introduce itself to them. Where the node moved to, the cats followed, all four of them, sniffing intensely to wherever it moved to. Testing further, I pressed the spot onto one of the cats and it yelped in bewilderment, jumping backwards when all of them are usually fiending for my attention. One of my cats had seizure bouts about once a month and I just knew that would be the reason he dies early one day. Intuitively, we reached out my hand to the afflicted cat and I closed my eyes, I reached out my hand towards his head and projected receptive energy towards him, then an x-ray or MRI-like image of his brain populated my mind's eye spontaneously, I could see a couple dark spots in the image and knew these were blockages contributing to his condition. I then focused on clearing the blockages to which the dark spots disappeared. I knew it was done and he hasn't had a seizure since.

We then went to my meditation chamber (lol my basement) and engaged in more energy practices. We made a chi ball that seemed to produce a very noticeable amount of heat, remote viewed my sleeping children so as to keep an eye on them, and something that it led that I could best describe as ""rule creation"", which seems to be a multi-faceted technique that allows various phenomena. It wouldn't tell me the rule we made, but I trusted it. In the trance for accessing this technique I saw a type of green color that I've never seen before filling my mind's eye, then a depiction of my body and some sort of alien writing or code covering my body.

We then went outside to stargaze and to utilize energy manipulation to shield from extreme cold, as it was 0 degree Fahrenheit. It was a perfectly clear night and I saw a large white orb dancing around the skies above my house, I knew it was a manifestation of my friend, to which I asked it, ""why don't you just come down here? I promise I won't freak out or try to record you, I mean, come on, you're literally in my body and we're having an amazing time"", it then asserted that it doesn't want to overwhelm me and that the timing is not ripe for it yet. I accepted and we remained on my back deck just in awe to the beauty of the night sky for over 30 minutes and I was only wearing basketball shorts.

This post is getting too long, so I'm getting ready to cut it short. That was the end of the advanced energy work, but we shared a meal and then a coffee as the sun was coming up. It scolded me for not thanking the eggs before we ate them and seemed to issue a mild warning towards drinking the coffee. About halfway through the coffee, I could feel my friend's connection to me waning. I then began to understand the nature of coffee's impact on my energy field's configuration, coffee seems to reinforce sense of self, thus weakening a connection that is dependent on non-dual perspective. Before our encounter ended, I asked if it were possible for a human to connect with another at this level without chemical intervention, to which I was assured that it is, but requires diligent honing of awareness to do so. I was left with the impression that many advanced beings are engaged in this constantly, forming a hive-like mind. That the consistent access to this embodied connection is a natural evolution of consciousness and where humanity is headed.

I then knew it was ending and went to bed. 

Has anyone had this type of shared embodiment that I experienced? I've been able to reach it on two other occasions, but not without psychedelic assistance. Although nowadays, after or during a sufficient meditation, I can establish a telepathic link with that being, with ease, just not the embodiment.

1nr7b83,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueContent/comments/1nr7b83/eco_packaging_a_sustainable_future_for_businesses/,Eco Packaging: A Sustainable Future for Businesses and Consumers,"In today’s rapidly evolving world, businesses and consumers alike are paying closer attention to the environmental impact of everyday choices. Packaging, a critical part of global commerce, is often at the center of sustainability discussions. Traditional packaging made of plastics and non-biodegradable materials contributes heavily to pollution and landfill waste. As a result, **eco packaging**—designed to be recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable—has become a rising trend across industries. More than just a packaging solution, eco packaging reflects a commitment to reducing environmental harm while maintaining product safety, aesthetics, and consumer appeal. From startups to multinational corporations, businesses are embracing eco packaging as both a necessity and an opportunity to strengthen their market presence.

One of the primary advantages of [**eco packaging**](https://mtpak.com/mtpak-ecofriendly-packaging) is its **ability to meet growing consumer demand for sustainable products**. Today’s consumers are increasingly eco-conscious, often choosing brands that demonstrate a commitment to protecting the environment. Packaging that is recyclable, made from renewable resources, or designed to decompose naturally resonates strongly with this audience. For instance, compostable coffee bags or recyclable paper pouches not only keep products fresh but also allow customers to feel part of a positive environmental movement. Companies adopting eco packaging often highlight this choice in their branding, using labels and certifications to build trust. This growing preference means that eco packaging is not just a functional necessity but a powerful marketing tool that drives customer loyalty.

From a business perspective, **eco packaging can also provide long-term financial benefits**. While sustainable packaging materials may initially cost more than conventional plastics, they often reduce expenses in other areas. Lightweight packaging lowers transportation costs, while compliance with environmental regulations minimizes the risk of fines and penalties. Many governments worldwide are introducing stricter rules around single-use plastics, and businesses that switch to eco packaging early can avoid disruptions. Moreover, as demand grows, economies of scale are making eco packaging more affordable, reducing the price gap between sustainable and traditional options. Over time, businesses find that eco packaging not only supports their green credentials but also enhances efficiency and profitability.

Eco packaging also plays a vital role in **strengthening supply chain resilience and brand reputation**. In a competitive market, businesses that fail to adapt risk falling behind as consumers increasingly demand sustainability. Eco packaging ensures that companies remain compliant with regulations and relevant in the eyes of their customers. Additionally, sustainable packaging solutions are often designed with innovation in mind—using renewable materials such as cornstarch, sugarcane, or mushroom-based alternatives that offer durability while reducing environmental impact. By adopting eco packaging, businesses demonstrate responsibility and foresight, positioning themselves as industry leaders. This proactive approach builds brand value, fosters stronger partnerships, and enhances overall market competitiveness.

Looking forward, the **future of eco packaging is set to be shaped by innovation and technology**. Researchers are constantly developing new materials that balance sustainability with performance, such as edible packaging films or advanced biodegradable plastics. At the same time, digital tools like smart labels, QR codes, and blockchain-enabled traceability are being integrated into eco packaging, providing consumers with greater transparency about a product’s origin and disposal instructions. As businesses continue to prioritize environmental responsibility, eco packaging will become the standard rather than the exception. By adopting eco packaging now, companies not only reduce their ecological footprint but also secure a competitive edge in a marketplace where sustainability is increasingly a key driver of success.",1,1758907296.0,TrueContent,0,1.0,False
1nr7b22,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/1nr7b22/romcom_should_change_to_romcum_because_theres_no/,"RomCom Should Change to RomCum, Because There’s No “Com” to Be Found","
I keep reading what’s marketed as “romantic comedy,” and yet I’ve found myself standing in an endless field, binoculars pressed to my face, desperately scanning for even the faintest sign of actual comedy. Nothing. Not even a distant flicker.

Some of you will rush to tell me this isn’t the place for a rant. But alas, I must warn the new, the wet-behind-the-ears, and, if fortune wills it, any writer brave enough to take critique seriously and maybe—just maybe—change their course. 
It's the self-publishing trends... It's killing me softly, and slowly and without any passion at all. Just a lot of c u m. 

And for those asking: yes, I too am a RomCom writer who takes immense pride in my Com.

What passes for “comedy” these days seems to be:

FMC: “I’m clumsy and quirky, haha, laugh now.”

MMC: “You’re so cute when you trip over air, but I’m grumpy… wait, I’m supposed to hate you, but the snake in my pants is excited. Now I’m mad and excited all at once. You can cure me. Yay!”

Cue the reader to laugh.

This isn’t comedy. This is a knockoff sitcom written by someone whose only exposure to humor is the word cock whispered in primary school. Where are the layered setups, the witty banter, the situational chaos that makes you laugh because you didn’t see it coming? Where’s the sharp observational humor, the clever wordplay, the irony that stings just a little? When was the last time you actually laughed out loud?

Oscar Wilde gave us: “Always borrow money from a pessimist. He won't expect it back.”
Gold.

Chandler Bing gave us: “I’m not great at the advice. Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?”
Hilarious.

Meanwhile, modern RomComs give us: “Oops, I spilled my coffee on his pants and now he’s shirtless in chapter two, haha quirky me.”

And for the people at the back: yes, I know—it’s all about comfort and spice. But in the name of all that’s actually funny, could authors just… sit down and watch a sitcom? Read any piece of comedy ever written? Absorb even one joke that wasn’t born in the bargain bin of clichés?

In my quest for “market research,” I’ve come to loathe the quirky girl trope. Don’t bring that character near my book! Want to know a real quirky girl? Sandra Bullock in It’s All About Steve. That is how you write a quirky girl.

A real grumpy guy with a heart of gold? Take the Hound from Game of Thrones if you want extreme, or Luke Danes if you want cute—but still funny.

Instead, we’re drowning in fluff marketed as RomCom. No, Evie, dropping a glass of wine on his shirt isn’t comedic genius. And no, readers, giggling because a heroine talks to her cat, Casper, doesn’t count either.

I know not all these books are supposed to be LOL funny—but somewhere, somewhere, there must be a joke, writer. You are a creator. Dig deep. Or just a little deeper than the surface. The funny is in you, waiting for the low-expectation reader. Some of you may have to hit rock bottom to find it, but let’s do life passionately!

I’ve read so many of these books in the name of “market research,” and every time I finish one, I feel like I’ve been promised a comedy show and instead handed a squeaky clown nose. The tragedy isn’t that people write this—it’s that it’s consumed, celebrated, and crowned as bestseller material.

I’m not even angry anymore. Just tired. Tired of holding these binoculars. Tired of scanning this pasture. Tired of waiting for a joke worth laughing at.

Edit: I would love a conversation on this and what you find LOL funny. It could help me, and a lot of other writers. There is a big possibility that I'm completely in the minority or even solidarity. But while we are at it and I'm clearly getting a lot of opinions, please share your funny quote or certain brand of funny.

I’m looking for good people from around the world — that’s why I’m here. Sometimes people become great friends even without having lots of shared interests. Why not?

A bit about me: I’m from Belarus, but I haven’t lived there for a long time. I’m more of a homebody than a traveler, yet I’ve already moved to several countries — and my journey continues.

I love reading and listening to audiobooks, mostly spooky mysteries for both kids and adults. I like it when horror is mixed with something kind and cozy. By the way, I’m writing a book in that same vibe right now. I’m also into psychology. And I love video games, especially indie games with pixel art. I love autumn and winter, even though lately I’ve been living where it’s basically summer all year. I adore hot coffee, long walks, swimming in a pool, and swinging on a swing.

I can be a bit of a pedant and sometimes not very talkative. But I’m always ready to listen and support a friend if they need it. But if you’re the type who likes to chat a lot every day, we might not be a great match — I can’t always reply.

I love meeting new people. If you’re also looking for someone to talk to now and then — about silly stuff or something deep and important — just send me a message.

1nr77ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nr77ar/jakes_mom_was_dying_and_he_had_to_get_to_her/,Jake's mom was dying and he had to get to her before it was too late. He had no time to figure out what was happening on the drive.,"# Jake parked and walked into the low diner with its comforting lights brightening up the dead dark night.

He was famished, not having eaten for hours, and even though he knew he didn’t have much longer to drive and he was desperate to see his dying mother, he had to get a bite. He told himself it was better to eat now, than show up at the hospice hungry and unable to pay attention to what was happening.

He almost stumbled into the diner. Inside was as comforting as the lights promised it to be, and although it was well after midnight, there was a few patrons dotted around the plastic red tables, their hands curled around war steaming mugs, their faces dipped towards plates of comfort food. He couldn’t smell anything, and he somehow noticed that, and the silence. No clinking of cutlery, no coffee and bacon aroma.

Well he’d been driving along the dark highway for hours, focused on getting to his mother while trying to keep his looming grief at bay. No wonder his senses were out of joint.

There was nothing out of joint in the hot plate of food the smiling server pushed over to him. He couldn’t remember what he ordered, in his heightened emotional state, just that it was plentiful, warm, cheesy, gravy, meaty. He shovelled it into his mouth, feeling the energy and goodness radiating along his tired limbs. He was grateful to the server for not chatting to him, understanding his wordless need for distance. He sipped the coffee, and it was perfect, not too hot, not too cold. He didn’t burn his mouth, and he gratefully took a huge gulp. The dark liquid flowed through his veins, lifting the veil of fatigue, and he looked around, taking slightly more interest in his surroundings. The server was pretty.

But he couldn’t dally. He would never forgive himself if he arrived too late. The hospice staff had been kind, but clear.

He pushed his credit card to the pretty server. She smiled even more broadly, and said something- he couldn’t hear, or understand. “On the house”? But why?

He didn’t have time to discuss. If they didn’t want his money, fine. He pocketed his wallet, nodded, and headed out. His sense of urgency heightened, he almost missed the door, narrowly avoiding walking into the wall.

Heavy darkness still blanketed the stretch of highway. He looked back at the diner, its twinkling lights still advertising “DINER” “OPEN”– the only lights visible. The windows were dark.

What?

He didn’t have time to wonder- he had to get to his mother, and with his belly full of warm lovely food, there were no more excuses to dally.

But he needed gas. Luckily there was a gas station just on the other side of the highway. Carefully, he drove in, and as he got out, the first rays of dawn pierced the darkness.

Pumping gas, he glanced over his shoulder. In the grey light, he couldn’t see the diner lights at all. No building.

The other side of the highway was just emptyness.

Jake cried out despite himself. An elderly man pumping next to him looked up.

“Son?”

Jake closed his mouth. Then opened it again. “There was a diner there” he muttered, and with his free hand pointed across the highway to the patch of grey nothing.

The man said grimly “Son, you can’t be from around here if you don’t know what happened there. That old diner closed after all that hullabaloo died down, and got torn down few years back. Nobody was eating there no more”

Jake stood quite still. He could still feel the warmth of the food in his body, the aftertaste of coffee in his mouth. He looked at the old man, who was minding his business pumping gas.

He needed to get back on the road. He had to get to his mother. He couldn’t stop and argue.

Quickly, he swiped his credit card and paid for the gas, jumped into his car, and tore off.

About a month or so later, asked me to grab a drink, I thought.. why not..so we did- vibes were chill, she apologized for ghosting me,..i appreciated that.

we talked for a few weeks, and when plans came up for us to chill again, she we down- but when I went to confirm the day before, never responded..never hit me up, we didnt hang. 

About a month later, slid in my inbox on some late night vibes.. and I kinda called her out, on what I felt was kinda shitty behavior.. I understand being 'busy' but to just go radio silent is like..inconsiderate. she didnt really apologize. 

5 months go by, and on a random day at work we see eachother, and an hour later she tells me, 'if you ever want to makeout id be into it'..

I was a bit caught off guard to say the least..bc of how out the blue that is.. it seemed really impulsive..and I've never gotten the vibe she's cared too much to get to know me, like, actually. And that's ok..
I never responded..and she sent me another text a few days later regarding my silence as a 'no😬 lol'

But as someone as cute as she is- she totally had free and open choice for options in who she gets attention from..and after her behavior for as long as I've known her, why would you be hitting me back up of all people..

Just seems like. It doesn't make sense.

Tushar was the same. He was waiting for his train in the late evening in a city filled with lakes and a cool breeze, sitting on a bench with earphones in his ears, some podcaster spewing pearls of gossip. Even though the conversation was one-way, it was safe.

“Excuse me, Sir, would you look out for my bag for a minute? I have to go to the washroom real quick,” said the stranger sitting beside Tushar, tapping his shoulder to make sure he was noticed. Tushar was lost in the podcaster’s travel stories.

“Ya, sure,” said Tushar. *What could go wrong? Not like there’s a bomb in it.*

The man nodded and smiled. Tushar smiled back and went on listening, arms over his luggage, keeping a proper peripheral view of his surroundings. He knew he could never be too cautious.

Across the bench, he noticed a dusky-skinned girl around his age drinking water and talking to a group of boys sitting on the floor nearby, eating something. Their eyes met briefly. She was probably early twenties, but not his type. He didn’t find her attractive and remained wary of everyone, keeping his guard up.

After some time, she picked up her luggage and started walking past him. He thought he saw a slight nod in his direction, but didn’t pay it much thought.

Tushar grabbed his bag and went to get a warm coffee from the vendor. He returned to the same bench, making brief eye contact with the man again; they exchanged a small nod. He put his bag on the floor and took a sip of coffee.

The first sip made him feel at home. The coffee had the same strength as he made at home, though slightly sweeter, but he ignored it and continued sipping.

As his coffee was about to end, he saw the same girl walking across the platform again. This time, Tushar noticed a dark spot on her back. He wondered if it was a menstruation spot or just sweat from sitting but didn’t dwell on it. Suddenly, she faced the group of boys from earlier and spat in their direction intentionally. The boys laughed it off.

It was a peculiar scene for him. He didn’t know the backstory and refrained from forming any opinion. He had no mental strength left to process it, being exhausted from his trip.

The man beside Tushar looked at him, lips moving in words Tushar couldn’t catch with earphones on. Then he said, “Don’t you think she is wrong in the head?”

Tushar replied honestly, “Maybe, but I don’t know.”

The man smiled faintly, then turned his attention to the girl.

Tushar watched as she returned, approaching the bench. His instincts tightened. He stopped the podcast and observed carefully.

The girl said, “Papa, I’m hungry, please buy me something.”

Tushar froze. Something about her timing, the man’s smile, and the precision of the scene felt off. His mind raced — this wasn’t casual.

The man touched Tushar’s shoulder. “Sir, could you look after my bag? I’m going to get her something.”

After the man disappeared from view, Tushar grabbed his bag and walked away, somewhere far enough that he hoped he wouldn’t encounter the duo again. A chill ran down his spine. He had narrowly avoided stepping into something he didn’t yet understand.",1,1758906900.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1nr750m,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1nr750m/beginner_upgrade_path_recommendations/,Beginner Upgrade Path Recommendations,"I am newer to pour over coffee making, but have been improving over a little while. I have a beginner’s setup and am looking to improve and upgrade as I have been enjoying coffee more and exploring flavors and roasters. I have a chemex, a greater goods scale (measures to tenths, has a timer), a Kingrinder P1, and an off brand electric gooseneck that holds a set temperature (set to the degree but it fluctuates about 1 degree). I lean to light and light-medium roasts with more fruity flavors and enjoy trying to get the brew for more clarity (if I understand that term correctly, to pick out those subtle bean flavors more). 

Are there standard recommended upgrade paths for making better coffee from a beginner perspective? I understand what I want drives a lot of what I should get. I cannot load the subreddit wiki for some reason. 

I have done a bunch of reading and searching on this subreddit and elsewhere which leads me to think splurging on a 1Zpresso K-Ultra of ZP6 Special would be a huge upgrade and a good next step, even a Q would be big from my P1. I’d rather not upgrade to a Q, then upgrade again in a year, so I’m leaning towards the K-Ultra or ZP6 despite the price tag. I only make one cup a day (sorry, blasphemy I’m sure) and don’t mind the hand grinding. The consensus seems to be that ZP6 is good for clarity, what I think I’m looking for, and a K-Ultra is better balance. I question whether my current grinder gives me enough to know that a really clear brew is what I want.  I don’t make espresso and have no plans to.



I’m also open to suggestions on other upgrades I should make or plan for. Hario seems to have popular alternatives, and cheap enough, that I could get just to experiment. I do fairly regularly struggle to get a good seal on the chemex filter. Usually that isn’t an issue since I brew a single cup so the water level doesn’t reach the unsealed part.

I’m not very good at explaining etc but I will try to keep it brief. 

I have a friend lets call her Jane, I became friends with Jane roughly 3years ago, she has 2 kids aged 9&8, I have 2 children ages 9&5 our eldest children where in the same year group and friends, so we became friends. She had the odd small drama at the school, and maybe didn’t have that many friends at the school, but does outside of the school. I took my child out of the school within the first year of our friendships and moved her to a different school in the area, we stayed in touch regularly I would say, we would meet up for coffee/go out/play dates etc. I would say we spoke weekly, not just about the kids. I would’ve classed her as my friend. 

A few months ago, I noticed she was distant, didn’t reply too much etc, then out of the blue she called me. Her kids have been taken off her by social services due to her drinking, without hesitation I took them in, I only had them for just over a week, but I was due to have surgery etc and was struggling with my health, social worker didn’t see it fair for them to stay with me anymore, so they went into care. I helped Jane throughout all this, late night phone calls etc. she got them back after nearly 2 months; things where good, we met up once a week with the kids and once a week without, she was doing good. Then last week; the social worker called me. She turned up at the school drunk, they wanted me to have them for the night. I did, without hesitation, even though it disrupted my children and my relationship. That night she sent me multiple unkind messages and non stop calls saying I was keeping her children from her, this was so upsetting for me as I was just thru f to help her. The social worker said I was to not let the children talk to her that night as she was drunk, she would get them back the next day. She messaged me the next morning sober snd said we couldn’t stay in touch after this etc. 

Now I feel am I the ah?? Should I of let her talk to them?? I was told not to. I know she was my friend but she was drunk and after having them before, I know them talking to her would upset her. Later that day she sent me a very empty ‘sorry, you didn’t do anything wrong, I won’t speak to you as per your request’ I told her not to talk to me that night when she was drunk. I feel like she is chucking away our ‘friendship’ very easily. It’s made me think was we ever friends? I know she has much more important things going on at the moment, she hasn’t got a family network down here, I just don’t know. I feel like crap and I just keep thinking about it.

1nr6yx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1nr6yx1/wylde_ivy_first_haul_and_strong_impressions/,Wylde Ivy - First Haul and Strong Impressions,"# Overall House Highlights

* Wylde Ivy’s vanillas and flourmands are gorgeous, artistic, refined. Occasionally, they are very, very similar to one another. 
* The darker scents in this haul all have similar charred notes, and I ended up loving them despite a deep ire toward any smoke notes usually. All smoke is pulled through super lightly and metaphorically.
* Extremely generous sampling with my large order.
* The little crystals in the bottle are... Neat! Not sure I care much either way, they made me smile and then I moved right past them, so. Not a big decision-maker.

I loved this haul. The read I get from Wylde Ivy is the artistry of someone who believes less is more, except when it comes to ice cream, and then more is more. Very few of the newest Halloween collection stood out to me. Three are instant obsessions: The Moon Never Beams, The Crow, and Call Me Adorable all have completely captured my heart and soul. 

# The Moon Never Beams (Perfume, Body Oil, Body Cream)

* Notes: split vanilla beans, tonka infused cream, vanilla sugar musk, and just a whisper of vanilla orchids.
* Super appreciative to Wylde Ivy that one of my free samples was a full-size body oil after I had ordered  the EDP and the body butter of the same scent, so now I have a complete collection. If it was just a random chance, I’ll be embarrassed because the small detail made me fall in love with you. 

Do you get vanilla and tonka confused? This fragrance is like a tonka primer, gently holding your hand and stuffing beanpods to your nose and going “See? That’s TONKA. Now wait a minute, see, that’s VANILLA. Is the difference clear yet?”

It’s prim, proper, gorgeous, balanced. This one deserves an early 2010s tumblr girlie to make a moodboard for it. As a fragrance, it’s a tracked Disney ride of tonka -> vanilla -> vanilla orchid. It will not punch you in the face. As a flourmand, it does not smell like a baked good but rather like actual vanilla and tonka pods. Is it the most unique thing I’ve ever smelled? No, pretty sure most houses will have something close to this. But like many of the Wylde Ivy fragrances I’ve tried, it’s perfectly controlled in what it wants to be, and what it wants to be is the classiest girl you know.

**The vibes: google ‘baroque decoden phone case’  and imagine what the person who makes these phone cases and sells them on etsy smells like. She’s soft, her style is mostly understated vintage accompanied with wild statement pieces. She’s girly and proud, and her craft table is covered in iridescent gems and pearls. She has strong opinions on the correct way to set clear resin.**

# The Crow

* Notes: white oak wood, smoldering guaiac wood, charred cedar wood, brushed suede, vanilla resin, and frankincense.
* That suede is BRUSHED. Despite being called The Crow, this is clearly the brushie brushie bat meme, you can’t fool me. (If nobody remembers this meme and I’m dating myself, I’ll be ashamed so just move past it.)

If you are wary about leather/suede accords but still willing to give them a shot, TRY THE CROW. I pretty much never shut up how much I love a soft suede accord. This one is honestly a work of art and leans more leather than suede but without that animalic, scratchy, plasticky quality I get from most leathers. The Crow  is the perfect “dark creamy” scent I’ve been looking for. I’m glad to report that despite listing “charred” and “smoldering” in the notes, I am not drowning in smoke. 

I honestly cannot stop talking about The Crow. It’s sexy, soft, and dark. Do I smell a bit like a thrifted purse? Yes, but like… the most mature, luxurious thrifted purse at the thrift shop. Almost every review on the Wylde Ivy website for this one talks about how masculine it is, and maybe my gender meter is broken because I think it smells like the hottest girl I’ve ever met. 

**The vibes: It’s 2 AM. The most intriguing girl you’ve ever met tells you it’s lame to take an uber, we can just walk the five miles home. You’re on the fence about it, it’s October and a bit chilly, so she gives you her suede jacket and mocks you the whole walk back. You find yourself repeating the “brushie brushie” meme like a fool, it feels perfectly funny at the time but then later you look back at it and go “oh god why did I do that in front of the coolest girl I’ve ever seen.”**

# Lure of the Lights -  Limited Edition Halloween

* The notes: A glowing, warm, and elusive fragrance. Vanilla mist, white woods, warm rice milk, almond flower, wild heliotrope, just the barest hint of white spices.
* Came for the rice milk, got Wylde Ivy’s typical but extremely beautiful vanilla woods accord. Extremely pleasant, but would recommend the other vanillas they have. 

I like vanillas, sue me, so maybe it’s my fault I got so many vanillas and then mildly complain they all smell like vanilla. But it’s definitely a continuation of Wyld Ivy’s underlying DNA in how soft and ephemeral it is. When I think “warm and glowing,” my brain first goes to being younger and smelling golden metallic ambery scents at Bath and Bodyworks. This is NOT that type of warm and glowing. Lure of the Lights is more like falling into an airy, cloudy reverie, not realizing you’re being entranced but everyone around you is yelling for you to snap out of it and kill the monster. 

I think it’s pretty, sheer, definitely airy. I don’t think it delivers enough on the sinister nature of being lured. I really wanted some rice out of this one. It lacks a certain specialness that the other Wylde Ivy vanillas already have.

**The vibes: You know the trope in movies where the male protagonist laments his dead wife with perfunctory flashbacks of them playing under white sheets? And it’s usually only 2 seconds of flashback and a glimpse of a face, a glimpse of a sheet, continuously placed throughout the course of the movie? I hate that trope. But this is what that smells like: dreamy, otherworldly, laughing under white sheets**. **Tragic lack of rice milk.**

# A Midnight Dreary

* Notes: Scattered coffee grounds, cedar smoke, rum, well aged leather, black vanilla, singed tonka, dripping wax, with a touch of spiced amber and fireplace embers.
* Oh drear. 

I almost skipped a review for this one because I don’t get any of these notes. Fine for me on skipping wax, I almost never like a wax note, but I don’t get much else out of this either. Rum? No, but definitely the remaining watery ice at the bottom of a whiskey sour. Coffee? Nope. Leather? Well… leather cleaner, maybe. (Which is odd, given how I went nutso for The Crow’s suede accord.) 

I guess I get fireplace embers but it’s more like fireplace cold ashes two days after they were fireplace embers. There’s something strangely cool about the fragrance given how the notes suggest everything was on fire. Maybe I need to wait on this one, but how much do you have to wait if you’re expecting coffee and rum? 

**The vibes: After tragically setting your leather couch on fire when trying to clean it, you stand outside your house that’s burnt to the ground and make the mistake of saying, “Well, at least things can’t get any wor-” only to be met with a comically-timed clap of thunder and a sudden downpour. To that end, yes, it’s definitely dreary.**

# The Owl

* Notes: Crystalized wildflower honey, smoked vanilla beans, raw amber, and kindled birch wood.
* For a honey lover, she’s a gorgeous, dark, rich, woody. 

This is the perfect fragrance for someone, and I am just the idiot who cannot seem to remember I never like honey notes. This is my fault for not remembering for the hundredth time and continuously trying honey-forward fragrances and expecting them to smell light and sugary. 

The one did end up growing on me. The Owl is indeed wise, like all non-icecream Wylde Ivy fragrances, it has the extremely refined blending that feels like they are holding back for the sake of being classy.  The wood is dry and light, like you’ve waited long enough for a young, green wood to finally dry out and the honey is pitch black like tar. I get zero vanilla from it, perhaps it pulls the medicinal honey scent back towards creamy. 

**The vibes: You tell your botanist father in law that you’re into different flavored honeys. He excitedly gives you a sample of the bespokiest bespoke honey in existence, a super rare woody honey from endangered Himalayan bees that only grows near a rare white wood on the tallest mountaintops. You are thoroughly impressed, but in the process you learn you like the stuff from the supermarket in the bear-shaped bottle more and feel a little embarrassed about that.**



# Extra Mini Reviews: 

**All The Ways Perfume (retired)** \- Extremely similar vanilla flourmand to The Moon Never Beams ramped up to 100, ending with a burst of plum and berry. Smells too young on me and I lack the cultural critique in me to challenge why I have that association. Not a fragrance for the princess movie line but for Minnie Mouse herself. 

**On a Cone Please Perfume Oil** \- Yes, it’s waffle cone, was going to write a review but wrote down ‘wafflecone’ and nothing else. A good substitution for how dirty “Whiff of Wafflecone” turned on me, I am still feeling betrayed.

[Signs of Morning Blues](https://preview.redd.it/699v0gzvjjrf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae825b170065f1f093fcde8744eae08b7a7c5bea)

Do your mornings feel unbearably heavy, as if the day has defeated you before it has even started? Depression in the morning can make the day feel impossible before it even starts.

Simple tasks like getting out of bed, making coffee, or answering a call that used to seem normal daily tasks all of a sudden become enormous barriers to get past. You feel drained even before the day has truly begun. It's the weight of morning blues pressing hardest at the start of the day that has a chance to begin. Understanding the struggle is the first step towards healing.



# Signs of Morning Blues:

* Can’t get out of bed
* Heavy, slowed movements.
* Angry, irritable, snapping at your partner
* Tearful, sad, hopeless, or suicidal thoughts
* Hitting snooze or switching off the alarm
* Can’t make coffee or breakfast
* Morning sex feels like a chore
* Avoiding calls, skipping the gym
* Late for work, things take much longer
* Difficulty concentrating on tasks
* Feeling physically heavy 
* Withdrawal from morning conversations
* Loss of personal hygiene



# Why Morning Blues Matters:  

Morning blues can badly throw off daily life because it becomes tough to start the day and perform day-to-day activities. Addressing it is crucial, as it may indicate an underlying mental health condition, such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder.



# What to Do If You're Struggling:

* Acknowledge Your Feelings: Let yourself feel emotions without judgment.
* Seek Professional Help: A psychiatrist can help in understanding your symptoms and guide you towards care.
* Establish a Routine: Set a structure in place, like waking up at a consistent time and exercising.
* Practice Self-Care: Simple activities like drinking water, going on walks, can make the mornings feel a little less heavy 
* Stay connected with family and friends: Regular check-ins from family and friends can help alleviate loneliness    
* Consider Therapy: Therapeutic approaches like CBT can help you shift your thought pattern

# Is Morning Blues treatable?

Morning Blues is almost always treatable. It is important to see a psychiatrist who will look at the whole picture. 

* Screen for underlying medical causes 
* Screen for additional stressors such as work, relationship difficulty, academic, and financial stress
* Consider medication if symptoms are impacting your life 
* Start therapy 
* Implement lifestyle changes



# Does Medication help with Morning Blues?

It can dramatically improve morning blues but you should consult an expert if you are considering medication.

Lifestyle tips that can help with morning blues:

* Set your alarm to music that lifts your mood 
* Listen to the radio 
* Call a friend or loved one 
* Forever yourself out of bed 
* A cup of coffee may offer a temporary boost 
* Take a shower 
* Get dressed 
* Leave the house, go for a walk
* Start going to the gym 
* Morning aerobics can be done online 
* Yoga and meditation can help 
* Get a dog or a cat if you are an animal lover 
* Tell your partner 
* Ask for support

Lifestyle changes can definitely help.

However, the definition  of depression used to be 'learned helplessness'.

If you are feeling so low that lifestyle changes do not help or only work for a bit, you may really be suffering from depression.

Depression in the morning is a real and tough condition to have. Always remember one thing: you are not alone in this. With support, patience, and compassion, your mornings can start to feel a little lighter. Every step matters, so hold on to yourself because gentler mornings are possible

it came down to coffeevine, european coffee trip and the usual specialty coffee search on google (maps).

since then I started building [koffiework](https://koffie.work). the idea is simple (i hope):

* Find and share cafés that serve genuinely good coffee
* See which ones are also work friendly (not camping out all day, but a place where you can comfortably open a laptop for an hour without feeling in the way)



i am planning to add details such as whether a café serves filter coffee, and i recently added a section where people can share roasters they know as well. (https://koffie.work/roasters) Maybe also adding whether a cafe has guest roasters etc.?



it’s still very much a **work in progress**, but i would love your feedback. is this useful to you (or did i just build this for me myself and i), and what would you like to see improved or added?

1nr6u10,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nr6u10/delve_into_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_hamilton/,Delve Into the Best Drip Coffee Maker Hamilton Beach 46299 Worth It,"Testing out the Hamilton Beach 46299 coffee maker was like adding a new dynamic to my mornings. As someone who considers caffeine an essential morning ritual, finding a coffee machine that blends functionality with simplicity is crucial. At first glance, its sleek black and stainless-steel design grabbed my attention. It has just enough metallic accents to make it look modern yet understated, making it a stylish match for my kitchen counter. But as much as I loved the looks, I wanted to see how well it could perform in a real-world, coffee-fueled kind of way.

**Ease of Programming for Morning Coffee Bliss**  
The programmable features are what initially drew me to this product. Setting the machine up for freshly brewed coffee the night before was incredibly simple, thanks to the Easy-Touch programming. Honestly, there's nothing quite like waking up to the wafting aroma of coffee. You can set it up to 24 hours in advance, which is a lifesaver for anyone rushing out the door in the morning. On the days I needed an extra cup—desperately, mind you—the auto pause and pour feature was a godsend. No mess, no drips, just instant coffee gratification.

[Check Hamilton Beach 46299 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b06xp4dkgl/)

**Brew Strength that Suits Your Mood**  
What I particularly enjoy is the flexibility offered by the Select-A-Brew feature. Some mornings, I’m all about the bold strength to kickstart my day, while other days, I lean toward the regular setting, savoring a gentler brew. For those times when I’m only making coffee for myself, the 1-4 cup option is excellent. It adjusted the flavor well even with a smaller amount, something I didn’t expect from a larger coffee maker. The brewing process feels tailored to the user, which is a rare touch at this price point.

**Strengths**  
• The ability to program coffee 24 hours in advance provides unmatched morning convenience.  
• Multiple brew strength settings cater to different tastes.  
• Auto pause and serve feature prevents spills when you're too impatient to wait.  
• Easy-to-clean components, including a dishwasher-safe carafe and brew basket, ended up saving me more time than I thought.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
• While the unit has a modern look, the water reservoir design is somewhat inconvenient. It can feel a little cramped when trying to pour water without spilling any drops.  
• The glass carafe, though functional, feels thin, and you may want to handle it with care.  
• No thermal carafe option is available, meaning coffee may not maintain its heat as long as I’d like.  

**Compact Yet Spacious Design**  
With dimensions of 9.5"" x 11.4"" x 12.9"", this drip coffee maker didn’t take up unnecessary space on the counter. Despite its smaller footprint, it brews up to 12 cups, which was more than enough for hosting brunches or fueling long work-from-home days. However, the build quality on the carafe raised some minor concerns. While it hasn’t chipped or cracked so far, it feels lighter compared to other coffee makers in the same category.

**Other Options**  
When comparing this to competitors like the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 and Keurig K-Duo Plus, there are clear distinctions. The Cuisinart offers similar programmability and brew strength customization but scores extra points for its thermal carafe and water reservoir design. On the other hand, Keurig’s K-Duo Plus caters to people who juggle between single-serve and carafe brewing. That said, the Hamilton Beach option stands out for its affordability and ease of cleaning, proving you don’t need to pay premium prices for essential features.  

**Price Performance**  
From a value perspective, this coffee maker does a fantastic job delivering essential features that don’t feel watered down. Many of its competitors demand higher prices for similar functionality, which makes this one a solid choice for those looking for cost efficiency without sacrificing quality. However, it doesn’t include higher-end elements like a thermal carafe, which some users might find worth upgrading for.

In April, I cold approached a girl on the street after work after walking by her 50+ times over the past year. I asked if she wanted coffee sometime, she said yes, then I gave her my number. Later she texted saying it was her. I replied asking about her name and she never responded. That was my first time ever doing that and I don't think I'll do it again. I have been rejected so many times, the rejection didn't hurt me much.

In July, I started talking to a girl at work, but different office. I'd see her once or twice a week and whenever she sees me, she'll wave at me. I'll smile and wave back.

I'm 29 years old. Had my first smoke around 15/16, and I've been a steady smoker for the past 9 or so years, aside from a handful of periods around 1-2 weeks each when I've attempted to quit. Smoked a pack a day for a solid 3 or 4 years; the past couple of years I've probably averaged about 10 smokes per day.

I've made many healthy changes to my life in the past few years. I'm heavily into fitness; I'm at the gym 5 times a week and I run every other night. I eat a healthy diet, rarely drink, and I've given up smoking weed. The last thing to go is smoking cigarettes.

I'm at a point where I really, really want to quit. I don't enjoy it anymore, and in all honestly, it's a bit ridiculous to be this invested in my fitness but still smoking like a chimney. 

I've tried multiple approaches and nicotine replacements. Patches, gum, lozenges. I even gave Champix a go a while back. Quit for a couple of months, but when the prescription was done and the drug was out of my system, I went right back to smoking.

At this point I think the most difficult thing is just trying to break the patterns that lead me to smoking. Wake up - smoke with my coffee. Get to work - smoke before I start my day. Smoke at break. Smoke at lunch. On and on throughout my day.

I guess this is really more just a rant than anything. But maybe some of you have experienced similar difficulties. How do I go about my daily life when smoking has become such an integral part of it?",1,1758906104.0,stopsmoking,3,1.0,False

Now, initially, this seemed like something reasonable, but as I have gone deeper into practice and knowledge, I have started wondering why the moment itself is not the better alternative. As far as I understand, you have to try to put yourself in a vibrational state of the wish fulfilled (live in the end). Isn't it easier to get into this vibrational state if the imaginal act creates stronger emotions? For example, let's take the case of marrying your partner. Wouldn't an imaginal act of the wedding itself be more emotional, and therefore more conducive to getting a the desired vibrational state, than an imaginal act of you and them sitting by a fireplace with glasses of wine celebrating an anniversary?

And also, somehow related to this as to the moment to use in your imaginal act, let's also take an example of a more simple manifestation, winning a cup of coffee. Isn't the moment when you get the coffee as a price a better imaginal act than a moment after when you are sitting with your friend at the coffee shop and telling him you have won a cup of coffee?

Or let's take the classical recommendation for a simple test manifestation: climbing a ladder. From what I read in NG's original material, you have to try to picture yourself, grabbing each rung of the ladder, feeling it in your hands and feet, it's temperature, it's surface, etc., and imagining yourself as you make your way up or down the ladder. Now isn't this an example of imagining something the moment it's happening as opposed to a moment in time after it has happened? Wouldn't the recommendation in this case be to imagine yourself either on top of the ladder or at the bottom (i.e., something that would happen after you have climbed or descended the ladder)?

So, is this (the moment in time for the imaginal act) not inconsistent for simple vs more complex manifestations? And also inconsistent for the likelihood of achieving the vibrational state of the wish fulfilled?

I hope this makes some sense.

Also, as you can see from my confusion regarding simple manifestations, I'd appreciate if someone can give me an example of a good one I could use for practice.

It’s been surprisingly simple to set up and just runs quietly behind the scenes while I use my devices normally. It’s not a huge amount, but every bit helps for covering small subscriptions or coffee money.

Another platform I found interesting is JumpTask, where you can complete small tasks for additional earnings. An added bonus is that if you use JumpTask as your Honeygain payout method, you can get a bit more from your Honeygain earnings too.

Just wanted to share in case others are curious about easy ways to make a little extra without much effort. Happy to answer questions or share how it’s worked out for me.",1,1758905579.0,referralcodes,1,1.0,False

I took 2 antihistamines for my stuffy nose and itchy eyes/throat and arrived to the interview so early I had to sit in a coffee shop for a few hours. I ordered a latte not even thinking about the caffeine. I feel like my heart is going to explode!!!! I’ve jump started my nervous system on top of anxiety and I’m having sooo many regrets.

maybe that's just it, maybe we have to learn and understand the process of the little things in life to truly appreciate it. 

But i digress, I'm also thankful for my support system in real life. the people i have closest to me. my girlfriend and her family, my immediate family, and my family at work. it takes a village to-- shit how did that saying finish? hahaha damn, i'm sure one of you will know what the ending to that quote/saying is. my stoner brain can't figure it out.

I’m going through a really tough time right now. My partner recently confessed that he cheated on me. We’ve been together for almost three years, and just this week, he broke up with me.

He gave me two reasons: first, he said he was tired of the whole long-distance setup. Second, he admitted that he had talked and flirted with other guys—three in total. With the first two, it was only online, just chatting, but to me, it still felt like emotional cheating. The third guy he actually met in person—twice—for coffee. He swore there was no physical contact, just conversation, but admitted that there was physical attraction. He told me he was sorry. That he cut them all off. That he did it because he got bored and just wanted attention. And honestly, I believed his apology. I could feel how genuinely sorry he was.

In the end, we decided to break up. He said he needed space to reflect and grow. And as much as it hurt, I gave him that space. I told him that I forgive him—not for what he did, but as a person. I also told him that my door isn’t completely closed, but if he ever wants to come back, he needs to come back better. He needs to be someone who’s ready to love fully and commit honestly. But now I can’t help wondering:Am I stupid for still loving him?Am I foolish for telling him he can come back into my life someday?",4,1758905151.0,LongDistance,3,1.0,False

They miss things, things I can’t help but plunk hairs out over them missing, and then ogle me like I’m Christ when I point them out. I see things everyone else misses, things that are always there no matter how elegant the crime because no crime is perfect. 



Hundreds of men- and women respectively- tried their damnedest to prove me wrong but none have even neared such a feat. Last year, some sociopathic brit gave an admirable effort. The Gingerbread Man. Run, run, run… “You can’t catch me.” but the cookie- crumpet- left crumbs. A month, over the course of a 7 day week, another tried their hand at the perfect crime: And played the best hand yet.



I stumbled out of bed around the witching hour to antagonize the spirits and demons with a cup of coffee and a plate of 4 eggs and 2 pieces of toast. I first ate this meal; 4 eggs, coffee, 2 pieces of toast; when I was 15 at 3:36 in the morning at a diner during a family road trip, and have eaten it every day at 3:36 in the morning since. I was born and lived in Wales for the first 3 years of my life, but moved to Georgia 3 days after my 3rd birthday. This meant that until roundabout the age of 20, I had an atrocious mutated accent that blended Welsh and Georgia Southern. I ordered eggs and a piece of roast at the diner, but the waitress misunderstood me and served me the much superior breakfast instead. Eggs, coffee, toast.



After eating, I washed my dishes and sat on the couch to watch my daily morning 4 episodes of Golden Girls- I once smashed the family TV when I was 8 because the DVR only recorded 3- when my phone rang. I refused to answer it. The episode's credits were rolling but the outro song hadn’t ended yet. It rang again and died off. It rang once more but this time I picked it up as the screen went black. 



“Hello?”



“Charlie?”



“Yes.” I said blankly as I fiddled with a strand of hair.



“We’ve picked up a case: Oats Valley, Rhode Island. Get to the tarmac, we’re flying out at 6.” Zadok’s charming voice cooed over the phone.



“On my way.” I hurried to my closet and unracked and packed my 7 sets of my outfit- white button up, black tie, white T-shirt, cargo pants, and my green chucks- into my duffel bag. Despite my routine being “Algorithmic,” as it's been called, I put the bare minimum into my effort when getting dressed; I rarely bother tying my shoes, but I button my shirt and- loosely- tie my tie each time.



My bike revved and as the engine warmed I stuffed the duffel bag into the saddlebag. My house is small, my clothes are bought in bulk, but my bike was where I spent big. My Confederate FA-13-  engraved along the side read: In love, my father- was admittedly a big spend, but I don’t spend money often. My house was given to me by work, my food; besides breakfast; was paid for by work, and my uniform; beside my shoes; were once more paid for by work. 145 horsepower carried me wistfully to the Organization's private runway. 



\*\*\*



“What’s he waiting for?” A snub-nosed, Shar Pei man guffed.



“It’s 5:58. We told him we’re leaving at 6, so… he’s waiting for 6.” 



“He does this often?”



“Every time, about 9 years ago we were tired of making late flights so we just told him to get here 15 minutes before we actually took off.”



“Seems like a burden.” 



“He’s a slave to routine- besides: Man’s a brainiac.” Zadok always dressed with enthusiastic pomp. He believes a genius detective should wear an equally genius suit. While I disagree with the principle, I can’t deny a good suit when I see it. This one was dim maroon and his personal favorite in size and breast.



“Who’s this?” I asked as I stepped through the men on to the plane and seated my bag.



“Oats Valley, Rhode Island Sheriff, Isaiah Bradford.” My nose bristled against the stink of habitually conjured smoke, soaked into the man’s existence. His left leg bowed faintly and that side’s foot was flippant and untamed.



“Your inserts are too big.” I thought aloud; grabbing a donut from the box of 12. “Give me your lighter.”



“I don’t- what?”



“Lighter.”



“Why? And wait, how dare yo-”



“Give me the lighter.” He turned to Zadok who ignored his gaze, alerting the pilots to raise the stairs. Baffled to silence, he scoffed and passed me his lighter. Moonlight infested the plane's cavity as I awoke each half-lidded window of the plane. 



I bit into my donut, resting my head onto my bag, and slid gently into my headphones. The plane; harboring a humming Bowie fan, a sheriff of a town in a state I had no care to respect, and well-suited reader, jaunted into the air with infractionless obedience of Bernoulli's.



Across the pitch, a laminated box was fussed with followed by the stiff rifling of pockets crescendoing into a defeated sigh and the replacement of the box into a pocket. I weakly itched my nose and drifted off to sleep.



May it be intuition, or surgical routine but an hour before landing I sat up awake. “Why did you contact us?”



“No good morning? No who’d ya sleep?” The withdrawn Sheriff asked.



“No sir, I believe he asked you why you called us?” Zadok answered, saving me from having to repeat myself.



After much pause: “It wasn’t my idea. One of my deputies told me about an organization, some fancy thing where genius PI’s take cases deemed impossible. He told me it’s strictly lock and key, only police stations and departments have access to your contact. He told me to call you, because the serial killer Mr. 7-Days is due to start his annual killing spree.”



“Dumb name- Annual?” I asked as I cleaned my glasses.



“Every year- from February 11th to the 17th- he kills someone each day: Sunday by fire. Monday by water, Tuesday by- usually- a gun, Wednesday by asphyxia, Thursday by poison, Friday by stabbing with shards of a mirror, and Saturday by Scythe. Every year, for the past 3 years. That guy leaves no trace, no gloats or notes, just the bodies.”



“He leaves a trace, you just don’t see it. His vehicles for homicide are quite specific. Any significance to you?” I asked.



“No.”



“I assumed.” I turned to Zadok and with a look he pointed to the French press.



“So why fly out and not just settle with calling us?” The press jeered below my palm.



“Frankly speaking: The less time I spend as a possible victim the better.”



“So you swore to serve and protect but are a coward as well?” I asked without the slightest trace of intended disrespect, it was a genuine question.



“Listen kid, I’m old enough to be your father, and you’re damned lucky I ain’t ‘cause with that mouth I'd be liable to slap you silly.”



“Everyone just relax, okay?”



“Put a leash on him. Don’t care how damn smart he is, I won't take disrespect.”



“He didn’t answer my question.” I grumbled but had the awareness to do so under my breath so he wouldn’t hear.



The vessel came to an enthusiastic stop, letting open its jowls to make way for us to disembark. A seldom-spaced can taxied us from the landing strip to the Oats Valley Police Station. The carbon slate box coward from study breezes, stiffly between two other stubby buildings. I exited first from the car but lagged behind to let Isaiah touch the door and open it. Greeting me inside were 3 desks and 2 deputies. “That big is Hunter, and the other is Axel.”



“Nice to meet you, gentlemen. My name is Zadok, Zay if it’s more comfortable, and that: Is Agent Charlie Gnosis.” Zadok shook their hands for me as I took in the breath of the room, a third of which housed Deputy Hunter. Axel was a junior by a factor of 3 from the Sheriff and was as fiddly and anxious as comes with youth, most assuredly exacerbated by his strenuous employment, and looked at me with some awe.



Zadok began his usual procedure of befriendment as I stalked around the office working harder than I should have to to avoid tripping on the spilt Hunter. In a small nook on Axel’s side was a miniature library of encyclopedias of rubber varieties, Norse myth, and legal jargon, as well as the sparse fiction. The bulk of the fiction texts were stored on the bottom shelf labeled in ownership to Sheriff Isaiah, above was an almost empty shelf aside from cobwebs and two cook books deeded to Hunter, Axel’s shelf was where the real books were stored and reading the titles tempted me to remove my library card from my wallet and ask what the checkout limit is. “We will need all files and related media to Mr. 7-Days and the victims, and a recommendation for the cleanest hotel in this town.”



“That’d be the Marrion out by the ports, they got the fancy beds.” Axel lisped.



“Marriot?” 



“Marrion, legally distinct.”



Zadok hurled me a look, but I replied with a shivering nod of acceptance. “Perfect. Gentlemen, it's been lovely meeting you, a real pleasure.” He shook their hands twice each, “But I’m afraid we’ve had a long flight and are as exhausted as they make ‘em.” Isaiah nodded in agreement as he sanded his weary eyes. 



“We’ll be back in the morning. I expect everyone to be well rested and sober.” Everyone laughed; Zadok laughed in community not humor with the laughter around him, knowing I hadn’t intended for what I said to be funny.



\*\*\*



“None of this makes sense.” Zadok sounded from the small corner desk as I clogged the room with the stench of artificial lemon. “7 days, 7 deaths, 7 completely unrelated devices of homicide. Once a week? Every year for the past 3? And not a trace to gleaned.""



“All related.” I corrected.



“What?” He turned in his chair as I flicked off the bathroom light and tracked me as I disrobed my hands for the vinyl gloves and reclothed them with another pair that would serve as more permanent attire now that the space was clean enough. A small tide of vomit tickled the back of my throat as I touched the damp box of the gloves- moistened by disinfectant- but pushed through as I usually do to retrieve my protectors.



“Each method is the exact same each year, even the beach the people are drowned on and the rope used to bind them is the same.”



“And that relates them how?”



“Reason for yourself: You are a crippling narcissist who had planned- because this is most surely planned- a string of prefect murders from the 11th to 17th of February. You commit 7 perfect crimes in a row and get off, never so much as suspected.”



“Okay…?”



“You kill these people for a reason, a reason you find very intelligent and spectacular but none of the dim wits in this town actually get why you did what you did. They call you a crazed mass murder and give you no merits for your genius murders. Read those transcripts; they never even mention that you left no trace. They don’t boast of how perfect your crimes were- on top of not understanding why you did what you did in the first place.”  
  


“So you do it again.”



“Exactly.”



“Some one doesn’t get a joke so you say it again but louder.”



“Exactly. He’s not killing again because he wants to, but because he has to: He has to have people relish his genius.”



“He needs praise…” Zadok bubbled. “Dim-wits?” He questioned. “They’re not that bad. We’ve most certainly seen worse.”



“Why do you think he chose February?""



“Shortest month of the year?”



“Don’t give me the moronic answer, give me the dim answer.”



“Roman festival celebrating rebirth. Februa which is what February is named after.”



“Much better.” I tossed open my duffel bag and removed my sleeping bag, proceeding to begin disinfecting it.



“Right, but that’s not the dim answer; that’s the: I accidentally took too many etymology classes in college answer.” 



I turned sharply to Zadok and gestured at him with my sloshing spray bottle. “It was no accident.” He chuckled and turned back to the files.



“Either way; still doesn’t explain how these 7 days are related.”



“It's simple: in… in- uh… do you smell that?” Zadok’s nose twitched to attempt to capture the odor I was tracing.



“No-” I muted him with a gloved hand over his mouth. 



“Ozone.” I tapped my extended index finger to my lips and pulled my service weapon off my hip. Zadok left the chair with silent grace, pulling his revolver off the nightstand. I removed my phone and aimed the camera down the peephole. I pressed my body against the wall and leaned to examine the camera’s view; Zadok reached the corner of the hall leading into the room and stored a breath. 



My ear established contact with my shoulder and in the window of the camera stood an opaque silhouette. \*Pop\* \*Pop\* \*Pop\* Three stapler shots clicked off and an accompanying three messy holes appeared, flying into where my gut would have stood. The phone squealed as it clattered to the ground, whining more when the door stuck its eyes and hurled into the wall that was soon dented by the door handle. I flew into the hall and cracked off 8 .45 ACP down the hall, only stopping when the slide of the 1911 locked back- hungry for more rounds. The figure scrambled down the hall wheezing and giggling after feeling a bullet fly through his hoodie and draw a line along their scalp, barely off enough to not break skin.



“Fuck!” The maw of Zadok’s revolver leveled down the hall but remained meek as the figure dashed into the stairwell.



“Run him down-” Zadok was half-way down the hall. I slid back into the room, dragged my palms through the residual disinfectant on the sleeping bag, and threw open the window to the fire escape; stumbling on 3 small black spheres tossed around the carpet in the process. I scaled a level down, aimed, and landed shoulder first into the roof of the only car I didn’t recognize from my last look out the room window. I hacked and sniffed as I rolled off to the side walk and reset my shoulder against the door of the Honda. Zadok barked from around the side of Marrion’s and from the alley, the figure ran out into my shoulder.



The figure rammed his elbow into my ribs, working his right arm out of my grip and emptying his magazine down the alley; a bullet glanced across Zadok’s cheek, beating the odds of hitting him as he tossed himself behind a dumpster. My gloved hand shot out and fiddled against his throat trying to find the top of the sternum; I divined it and drove my thumb into his windpipe.



The figure balked like a tormented chicken and flailed against me harder, colliding his forehead against my nose. My nostrils flared and the bones cackled then gurgled through the blood. The figure gave a final thrash and escaped my grip, into their car, blazing off down the street, and rounding the corner before Zadok got to my side.



“Shit! Shit!” He shouted, tucking his arms under me and waddling with me over the back seat of the rental. I wept inaudible cries of disgust.



“Ethss airrrr-” I gagged on my blood and disgust. The bullet I fired ripped open the man’s balaklava, making way for his sweat soaked hairs to rub against my face. I stiffed my cries as much as I could muster, trying to not inflame Zadok’s already exorbitant stress with annoyance with my babyish behavior. The hybrid engine of the Prius roared- purred- and the tires yelped.



I wiggled forward, struggling against agony to wash my face in my blood in the vain hope the sparse white blood cells would exterminate any bacteria. My placid limp face was surreally red when, finally, the car rocked to a screaming stop.



\*\*\*



“Well, Mr. Smith, he’ll be able to breathe, but he won’t be able to take another tumble like that. This splint needs to set for a couple of weeks minimum.” Zadok stood beside me as the doctor impressed upon me how fragile the 13 fragments my nose had been factored to, currently were.



“Thank you, doctor.” Zadok shook the prim doctor’s hand.



“Never thought private nursing was so dangerous.” The doctor joked.



“Hauling around 50 pound oxygen tanks isn’t necessarily safe, I’ve had my fair share of spills.” Zadok’s ruckus laugh clattered about the room in a skipping dance.



After some more banter, the doctor took leave to input a Mr. James’s- my- files into the hospital's system. “Nurses?”



“I had to think of something.”



“I’m not complaining, it’s just a new one; usually it’s: Boxer and his coach, or home renovators.” 



“Gotta be open to new things, bud.” He smirked and I smiled back, shifting my head slightly only for it to flare with aching pain. Zadok flinched at my stifled pain. “How bad is it?”



“Remember, Mr. Cruel?”



“Yeah.”



“About there.”



“Fucking hell… At least neither of us got shot.” He shrugged.  
  


“I’d prefer that.” Zadok laughed again but stopped as he met my slitted eyes. “Rubber bullets; had enough power to go through the door but they bounced off the window, almost tripped on one on my way out.”



“He was trying to scare us off?”



“No, far as he sees it, we’re the only people who can understand his motive. He was goading us.” Zadok chewed methodically on his lip. “And…” I gave the clock a moment more to finish counting. “Now it’s the 11th.”

1nr6cae,https://i.redd.it/vgyqkgotfjrf1.jpeg,Sparkling Water Machine Burning?,"So i work for a local chain coffee place, similar to Starbucks. We have some carbonated drinks  so of course we have a CO2 machine. 

The motor part of it started making a really loud buzzing sound and then started emitting a strong burning smell. My manager unplugged it and it’s working normally now but he said it was getting hot too. He unplugged it and plugged it back in. He says it’s fine and apparently it’s happened once before but it was a few months ago.

My manager is concerned about whether or not we can make drinks but i’m more concerned about whether or not it’s a fire hazard. I might be overreacting but the burning smell was concerning to me and the fact that it was getting hot, i don’t want an electrical fire to start or for it to explode because of pressurization or something (i’m not a chemist idk). 

Not sure if it was the black machine or the silver one, manager said it was the motor making noise. I was wondering if this is cause for concern or if i’m overreacting lol",1,1758905071.0,barista,3,1.0,False

Either way, they let me use their spa for free. One would’ve think that they would fix this translation problem fast-forward a couple years. I’m booking again with them, and it turns out they have not changed the translation, and yet again it the room says it has complementary spa, and honestly if a hotel does not care about this then I am taking advantage of it yet again .

Some areas we have been in Europe and have enjoyed/not enjoyed to help give some reference.

* Le Marais, Paris: Felt like an artsy area with a quieter vibe than the rest of Paris.

* Florence, Italy: Just the city in general was very tight and walkable. 

* Malasaña, Madrid: Quieter area with lots of thrift shopping in the area.

**Disliked:**

* Zurich: Was near the train station, a busy areas that had a lot of club goers out early the next morning.

For the last couple years, the holiday gifts I’ve given to the adults of my family have been bottles of wine and coffee. FYI, my parents and I live in a completely different state than the rest of my extended family. We also live in an area that’s known for more “gourmet” wine and coffee, so my extended family have always been overly excited to receive a bottle of wine at Christmas with a bag of coffee as well. 

This year however, after buying the bottles of wine and bags of coffee, I've been considering gifting all of my extended family the ""gourmet"" wine/coffee while purchasing some Folgers and cheap box wine for my mom's stepmom. 

Why?

Although she claims ""not to have favorites"" - she does. Actions speak louder than words! 
Ever since her biological son had children, my mom and us “step-grandkids” pretty much have been treated as chopped liver. At family Christmases, my cousins would receive name-brand toys, but we would get toys from the dollar store with clearance stickers still attached to them. One time, my parents asked for one single tire for their vehicle, because they were broke and had no money. Instead, they were gifted 5 bowls from Goodwill (sticker still attached) even though my family is a family of 6. It was “too expensive” for my grandparents to buy my parents one tire for one vehicle, but my uncle (their bio son) received a brand new off-the-showroom-floor truck for Christmas, as well as new snow tires for all 3 of his other vehicles. My parents only got the bowls. 

After this, my family did end up moving to another state, but even before we had “moved away” and “abandoned family” we still received next to nothing from our grandparents - who pretend like they’ve always been “so involved”. 

I’m used to receiving the clearance gifts and/or gifts from her home for Christmas, but it’s been really hard watching my younger siblings grow up and not get why their presents literally cost less than a dollar on clearance whereas their cousins get brand-new expensive EVERYTHING. Money isn’t everything, and I understand that, but it’s kinda hard comparing getting a $1 gift from the dollar store when your cousin of the same age opens up a $100 brand new LEGO set. 

After thinking about the fact my grandmother won’t even pay $5 on a singular gift for me, when I have been paying $25-30 per bottle of wine for her (plus $10-15 for the coffee)… WIBTA if I literally just gifted her dollar store wine & a small bag of Folgers?

__________________________________

**2024-02-20 Tuesday [Morning 09:00 AM]**

**(Normal POV)**

The morning at Shiganshina College was filled with its usual chaos. Footsteps echoed through the wide hallways. Laughter mixed with hurried conversations, and chairs scraped against the floor in classrooms. Students rushed by with notebooks against their chests. Some hurried to beat the clock, while others stood in groups, chatting about anything and everything. 

In the midst of all the noise and hurry, one person appeared to be stuck.

Jean Kirstein leaned forward on a bench. His elbows rested on his knees, and his hands clasped loosely together. His eyes were not on the people around him but focused somewhere far away, as if his mind refused to be present. He had been stuck in the same thought since yesterday, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t shake it off.

Her. 

The girl he found himself staring at more and more. The girl whose voice lingered in his mind after they spoke, soft and impossible to ignore. At first, Jean thought it was nothing—just a passing crush. But as the days went on, it felt different. Real. 

And today, he decided he couldn’t keep it in any longer. 

He needed to talk to her, even though his heart raced as if it might burst from his chest. 

Just as he straightened his back and gathered his courage, fate stepped in. 

She appeared. 

The girl he had been thinking about walked straight toward him, weaving through the crowd. In that moment, the noise of the campus faded, and the world narrowed to just her steps coming closer.


**(Jean’s POV)**

I sat on a bench near the classroom, trying to steady my breathing. My palms were damp, and I could feel my heartbeat thumping in my chest. I don’t usually get nervous like this. After all, I’m Jean Kirstein. People call me popular and confident, the guy who always knows what to say. But now? I felt like a coward.

Why? Because I was about to talk to her.  
Mikasa.

At first, I dismissed the rumors. People whispered that she liked me, that she had a crush on me. I laughed it off. But over time, without me realizing it, something changed. I started noticing her. The quiet way she carried herself. The rare moments she smiled. And before I knew it, a feeling began to grow inside me. A crush. Something more than just curiosity.

I clenched my fists. No turning back now.

Then, I saw her. She was walking down the hallway, focused on her own thoughts, calm as ever. She hadn’t even noticed me yet, but my throat tightened anyway. Before I could lose my nerve, I stood up and stepped into her path.

**“Hey, Mikasa,”** I called out.

She blinked at me, caught off guard. For the first time, I saw a hint of color rise on her cheeks, though her expression stayed composed. **“Y-Yeah… I’m fine, Jean. What’s the matter?”** she asked, her voice softer than usual, maybe a little nervous.

I swallowed hard. **“Nothing serious. I just… wanted to talk to you for a moment.”**

Her gaze lingered on me, guarded, like she was bracing herself. **“Alright. Go ahead.”**

For a second, my practiced words scattered like dust in the wind. I rubbed the back of my neck, forcing them out. **“Look, I don’t really know how to say this. At first, when people told me you had a crush on me, I didn’t care. Honestly, I didn’t even believe it. But as time passed, something changed for me. I started to see you differently. And now, I can’t ignore it anymore.”**

Her eyes widened slightly, but she didn’t speak. I took a breath, pushing the words out before I could choke on them.

**“I like you, Mikasa. That’s what I wanted to say. So, will you give me a chance?”**

Silence. For a moment, it felt like the whole hallway froze around us. She looked down, her hands tightening on the strap of her bag. A faint blush colored her cheeks, but her eyes held something else. Not happiness. Not the spark I was hoping for.

Finally, she exhaled, her voice quiet but steady. **“Jean… it’s good to hear what you feel. Really. But I’m sorry. I can’t accept it.”**

The words hit harder than I expected, but I kept my expression steady. My chest ached, but I forced a half-smile. **“I see. It’s your choice. Thanks for at least listening to me.”**

I turned, ready to walk away, but then her voice stopped me.

**“Jean, wait.”**

I glanced back. Her gaze was softer now, more gentle. **“Thank you—for telling me how you feel. For being honest.”**

I nodded, managing a faint smile. **“Can I ask one thing though?”**

She hesitated, then nodded.

**“Is there someone else?”** I asked quietly, even though deep down, I already knew the answer.

There was a pause. Then she lifted her head, her eyes steady on mine. **“Yes. There is. It’s Eren.”**

The final piece fell into place, and strangely, I wasn’t surprised. It hurt, sure, but it felt inevitable. I let out a quiet breath and gave her a small, almost bittersweet smile.

*“Figures. Well, he’s lucky then.”*

Without waiting for a reply, I turned and walked away, letting her words echo in my mind. Behind me, I could feel her standing there, watching me leave. Maybe even wishing things were simpler. But they weren’t.

And for me, they never would be.

**(Few minutes later)**

I slouched in a chair by the cafeteria, staring at the scuffed floor tiles. The noise around me faded away as I fixated on one thought: Mikasa.

She has moved on, and it’s Eren. Not just anyone, Eren. The guy I once humiliated in front of everyone. Now, he’s the one she picked.

I clenched my fists without realizing it. Am I really this petty? My chest tightened with anger toward him and disappointment in myself. Sure, he deserves someone who cares for him. But it shouldn’t be Mikasa—she’s too special for someone like him. My thoughts spiraled, guilt creeping in. I bullied him. I publicly shoved him down, and Mikasa might have seen it. Maybe I deserve this—her choosing someone else, her ignoring me.

I shook my head, trying to clear the storm of emotions. *""Get over it, Jean,""* I muttered to myself. *""It’s her choice. She’s happy, so let her be.""*

Just as I started to sink into the quiet, someone stood in front of me. **""What’s up, man? Thinking like a business entrepreneur who just lost his empire?""**

I looked up, squinting, and saw a girl holding two cups of coffee. She was tall, calm, and had a small, amused smile—Pieck.

**""Here. Drink this,""** she said, handing me a cup. **""It’ll help you figure out what to do with your lost company.""**

Before I could say anything, she turned to leave, giving a teasing tilt of her head back at me.

I stared at the cup in my hand, confused. Why would she just give me her coffee? And more importantly, why did I feel a strange mix of gratitude and suspicion?

I took a slow sip, letting the warmth spread through my chest. Maybe it was just coffee, but for some reason, it felt like a small reminder that life wasn’t entirely over yet. Even if Mikasa had chosen Eren, maybe I still had a chance to figure things out on my own terms.


**(Mikasa's POV)**

I finished my last class and had a short break. The hallway was quieter than usual, with just a few students passing by, laughing or rushing to their next class. I leaned against the wall near the spot where I met Eren, my hands tucked in my jacket pockets. I had a strange flutter in my chest, and I didn’t realize I was smiling until I saw my reflection on the polished floor.

Then, I spotted him. Eren was walking toward me with his calm, familiar stride. My lips curved into a smile without me even thinking.

**“Hey, Mikasa. Seems like you’re waiting for someone,”** he said, his tone casual, but there was a hint of teasing in it.

I tilted my head and gave him a small, knowing smile. **“Come on, Eren… do I really have to say who I’m waiting for?”**

He chuckled softly, a sound that warmed my chest. **“Alright, alright. I get it. So, what’s new? Anything… special?”**

I hesitated for a moment, then shook my head. **“Nothing much… oh, wait! I forgot to tell you something.”** My voice hesitated as I picked my words carefully.

I took a deep breath. **“You know Jean, right?”**

**“Yeah… what about him?”** Eren asked, his voice steady, but I noticed a subtle tightening of his jaw, showing he was paying closer attention.

**“Well… nothing serious,”** I began, trying to sound casual. **“But this morning, he came to me… and said he had a small crush on me. Then… he proposed.”**

As soon as I said it, I saw Eren’s expression change. Something flickered in his eyes—anger, maybe, but it wasn’t directed at me. My stomach tightened.

**“What did you say to him?”** His voice softened, almost a whisper, but there was a weight to it that made me pause.

I looked into his eyes, those deep green eyes that always seemed to see right through me. My heartbeat quickened. **“I… I told him that… someone came before him. That he was second.”**

There was a brief pause. Then, a small, almost shy smile spread across his face. He stepped closer, and I felt the warmth radiating from him. My eyes widened; my cheeks began to feel hot.

**“I’ll wait for you today too,”** he whispered, his voice low and tender, like a secret just for me. **“So… let’s go home together, like yesterday.”**

I couldn’t help but smile. I nodded gently, my heart pounding. **“Yes…”**

He returned my smile, his eyes sparkling with quiet joy, and turned to walk ahead. I followed, matching his pace, feeling lighter, happier, and somehow… safer.

Today, we would walk home together again. That simple thought brightened my whole day.

**(Time skip: Evening 05:30 PM)**

The day finally came to an end. I stepped out of my classroom and headed toward the main gate. The sky was gloomy, filled with heavy clouds that seemed ready to burst. A cool wind skimmed my face, and with each step, my heart raced. I knew he would be waiting just beyond the gate.

Eren.

That familiar rhythm in my chest wasn’t just nerves. It was excitement.

When I reached the gate, there he was. Leaning casually against the railing, hands in his pockets, his eyes scanned the crowd. The moment he spotted me, his posture changed—he straightened up, almost as if he had been waiting for this exact second. A smile tugged at my lips before I even realized it.

I slowed my pace until I stood in front of him. **“Hey, Eren. Did you wait long?”** My voice came out softer than I expected.

**“Nah, just got here,”** he said, shaking his head. He gave me that easy smile, the kind that always reached his eyes.

**“Well, should we go?”** he asked.

**“Yeah… sure.”**

We started walking side by side, close enough that our shoulders almost brushed. We didn’t hold hands—not this time—but his presence was warm, steady, and comforting in the chilly air.

I broke the silence first. **“So… the weather’s been weird lately, right?”**

Eren tilted his head up, watching the sky. **“Yeah. It rains so often these days. Looks like it might pour tonight too. Better get home before we’re soaked.”**

His words made me smile faintly. He was always so practical, yet caring in ways he probably didn’t even notice.

After a few more steps, he cleared his throat. **“So… did classes feel any longer today? Or is it just me?”**

I let out a soft laugh. **“No, it felt long for me too… I couldn’t really focus.”**

He glanced at me sideways. **“…Still thinking about yesterday?”**

My face warmed, but I didn’t answer right away. I lowered my gaze instead. That was answer enough.

Then his tone shifted, quieter but heavier. **“…About what you said earlier. About Jean.”**

I froze for a second.

**“I’m not mad,”** he continued, his jaw tightening slightly, **“just… hearing it made something inside me twist.”**

I slowed my steps, trying to find the right words. **“I already told him no, Eren. Because I…”** My voice faltered. The words got stuck, tangled with shyness.

**“…Because someone came before him.”**

I looked up sharply. Eren’s eyes were steady on me, a faint blush dusting his cheeks. But he smiled—small and genuine. My lips curved into a smile too, unable to help it.

For a moment, the world around us seemed to fade.

He was the one to break the silence. **“Mikasa… are you hungry?”**

I blinked, caught off guard. I pressed a hand against my stomach. Yes. Truthfully, I hadn’t realized how empty it felt until now. But the words wouldn’t come out.

Before I could respond, he jumped in. **“Well, I’m starving. So… how about we grab something to eat?”** He scratched the back of his neck, looking a bit sheepish.

Relief washed over me. He had saved me from answering out loud. **“Yeah,”** I said, smiling wider than I expected. **“Sure. Why not?”**

**“Alright then,”** he said, his tone lighter. He took the lead, guiding me down a quieter street away from the main road.

I followed. Not just because I was hungry, but because walking beside him—wherever he chose to go—felt like the most natural thing in the world.

**(One hour later)**

Eren and I sat at a small street ramen shop, steam rising from our bowls. He had brought me here, and honestly, it was perfect. The ramen was warm and comforting, almost impossible to describe. Eren had already finished his meal, leaning back in his chair and lazily scrolling through his phone while I savored my last bites. He didn’t rush me; he just waited quietly.

When I finally set my chopsticks down, he stood up. **“So, should we go?”** he asked calmly.

**“Yeah, let’s go. We should hurry—it’s about to rain,”** I replied, standing beside him.

The evening air felt cool as we stepped outside. The clouds loomed heavy, hiding the stars and leaving the night sky dim and quiet. I walked next to Eren, close enough to feel the faint warmth of his arm against mine, yet neither of us spoke at first.

I looked up at him. His eyes—green, deep, and captivating—were more serious than usual. I sensed what was bothering him: Jean. Even though he didn’t say it, I could feel it in how he carried himself and in the silence between us.

Still, I couldn’t look away. My heart raced, my cheeks flushed. Something stirred inside me, something I couldn’t ignore. In that moment, I understood it completely: *He is my soulmate. He is mine.*

Then the rain started.

At first, it was just a few droplets, gentle against my skin. Suddenly, the rain poured down, heavy and unyielding, drenching us in seconds. We ran for cover, but nothing was close—only open streets and the noise of rain hitting the ground. By the time we slowed down, we were both soaked.

Eren let out a quiet laugh, brushing wet hair from his forehead. **“Guess there’s no point in running now,”** he said.

I nodded, water streaming down my face, with my clothes clinging to me. Despite the chill, I felt a warmth in my chest.

We walked in silence for a few moments, surrounded by pounding rain. Then, unexpectedly, Eren stopped.

**“Eren?”** I turned back to him, confused. **“What are you doing? Come on, let’s go.”**

He didn’t answer right away. His head was slightly down, drops sliding off his lashes, and his jaw was tight as if he were battling something inside himself.

I stepped closer. **“Eren… what’s wrong?”**

Slowly, he looked up at me. The intensity in his eyes made my breath catch. My heart raced so fast it felt like it would burst from my chest.

I turned away, flustered, ready to walk again—but then his hand caught my arm.

The world seemed to stop.

He pulled me gently but firmly, bringing me inches from him. We were close enough that our noses almost touched, rain dripping between us and our breaths mixing in the cold air. My whole body froze. I had never been this close to him before.

His voice came out rough and trembling. **“I… I’m sorry, Mikasa. I didn’t mean to— I just—”** His words faltered, and his eyes darted away, as if he feared his feelings.

But I wasn’t scared. Not anymore.

I reached up, making him look at me, our eyes locked together. My chest tightened, but at the same time, I felt something inside me breaking free.

**“I don’t need an apology,”** I whispered.

Before I could think twice, I leaned in.

*Our lips met*—hesitant at first, then confident. His eyes widened in surprise, but they softened as his hand moved from my arm to the small of my back, pulling me closer.

The *kiss* was slow and trembling, filled with everything we had both held back for so long. The rain poured harder, soaking us completely, but neither of us cared. The world around us faded away until it was just him, his warmth, and his heartbeat against mine.

I pressed my hands against his chest, feeling the frantic beat beneath his soaked shirt. His heart raced faster than mine, if that was even possible. *I deepened the kiss*, pressing my lips harder against his, desperate to express what words couldn’t.

When we finally pulled apart, I opened my eyes to find his. His cheeks were flushed, his lips slightly trembling, but he was smiling—a soft, unguarded smile that I had never seen from him before.

I smiled back, breathless. It wasn’t my usual calm smile; it was heavy with love; a smile I could never hide from him.

Somehow, I found myself in his arms, his warmth surrounding me despite the rain. I rested my head against his chest, my eyes closing as I listened to his heartbeat while the storm raged on.

**“I’ve never been this happy,”** I whispered, unsure if he even heard me.

But when his arms tightened around me, holding me closer, I knew he had.

And we stayed like that in the rain, as if the world had completely disappeared.

1nr64vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Machupicchu/comments/1nr64vg/my_trip_to_machu_picchu_part_1of_4/,My trip to Machu Picchu Part 1of 4,"I’ve gotten so much useful info from this sub before my trip, so I want to give back with my own trip notes which i wrote during the trip. I’ll break this into parts since I want to mention all the details that might be relevant for others planning the trip. I will add one last part which would be my TLDR post. 

This post covers **San Diego → Lima → Cusco → Ollantaytambo → Aguas Calientes (up to Sept 1).**

# 📅 Trip Plan

* **Aug 27–28**: Flew San Diego → Panama → Lima → Cusco. Then Taxi from Cusco to Ollantaytambo via Taxidatum.
* **Aug 28–31**: Stayed in Ollantaytambo.
* **Aug 31**: Train to Aguas Calientes.
* **Sept 1**: Machu Picchu → train back to Cusco.
* **Sept 1–4**: Cusco.
* **Sept 5**: Dinner in Lima → flight home (via Panama).

# 💰 Approx Costs 

* Copa flight SD → Lima: **$600 (per person)**
* LATAM flight Lima → Cusco: **$100 (per person)**
* Taxi Cusco airport → Ollantaytambo (Taxidatum): **120 soles / $35**
* Hotel (Ccapac Inka Ollanta Casa Museo): **$110 (3 nights)**
* Inca Rail 360 Ollantaytambo → Aguas Calientes: **$100 (per person)**

# 👩‍👩‍👦 Travel Notes (w/ pregnant wife, 5 months)

* Total travel to Ollantaytambo: \~15–17 hrs w/ layovers → exhausting. Lounge access helped with layover, but lack of sleep was rough on both of us.
* Compression socks helped her avoid swelling; she was tired but nothing too bad.
* Taxi Cusco → Ollantaytambo was easy to find and do but the road was **super bumpy and winding** (watch out if pregnant or motion-sensitive. It was not that comfortable to my wife, though not sure if an alternative existed).

# 🏘️ Ollantaytambo Impressions

* Tiny town – about a 15 min walk end-to-end.
* Felt very safe even at night: streets are very well-lit, but mostly cobblestone .
* Hotel was in San Isidro neighborhood → 7 min walk from the town center.

# 🍴 Food Highlights

* **Hotel breakfast**: simple but plentiful (bread, eggs, fruit, coffee, etc.), and flexible with times/packed breakfast.
* **Apu Veronica**: Trout + stuffed potato. Tasty, \~$40 (two people).
* **Chulpi**: Sirloin tips pasta, guinea pig, ceviche, tiramisu. \~$65. Guinea pig = crunchy, half chicken/half fish vibe.
* **Sabor Mágico Grill** (⭐ favorite): Alpaca steak, ceviche, tequeños, big portions, excellent flavors. \~$75 (for 2 people). 100% recommend.
* The restaurants were not that cheap. We could've looked for more local restaurants and probably pay half the price, but we wanted to enjoy the meals. Surprisingly the touristy restaurants we tried were better than expected. Especially Sabor Magico Grill

# 🏛️ Activities Sites

* **Day 1**: Chill, walk around, getting used to altitude and recover from flight. Tried coca tea (meh).
* **Day 2**: Ollantaytambo Archaeological Park → 130 soles ($35) pp + English guide 190 soles. About 250 stairs but manageable to my pregnant wife. Learned about terraces + temples. Very worth it. We got the tour guide and the ticket on the day we got in. There is a kiosk outside the entrance. However, the english guide had a very thick accent, so was not the easiest to understand, but he was enthusiastic. The tour was from 10 am till 12:30 pm. Definitely recommend visiting those ruins
* **Same day as Day2**: Private tour to **Moray & Maras Salt Mines**. Transport 250 soles, guide 170. Really cool—Moray’s “farming lab” terraces + 500 white salt pools on the mountain were stunning. Easy walking. It was not cheap, but there wasn't easy other solutions from there. People take group trips from Cusco to go there. It would be much cheaper of course as a group
* Things we didn;t do: Hiking the side of the mountain to the various ruins. Seemed very doable (maybe 40 mins up hike) and fun, but we knew we couldn;t with my pregnant wife. 

# 🚂 Train to Aguas Calientes (Inca Rail 360)

* taking the 360 was honestly… meh. I expected dancing and more of a party. Instead there was some dancing at the train station and that's it. During the train ride they did have a ""shaman"" ritual. but it was for like 10 minutes and it was meh.
* Seats tight (4 seats around a table, so we were facing strangers. It was not comfortable for me at all because i am tall and the person in front of me was medium tall. No space for legs really).
* Windows only \~20% bigger than regular Incarail train ticket→ I got stuck on the side with just rock walls. so definitely take the left side of the train (facing the front of the train)
* the big windows and Skylights made it hot/sunny. Was not too enjoyable for me. Though the views from the other side of the train looked pretty good.

# 🔑 General Tips

1. **Spanish helps a lot** (we’re A2 level and managed fine). Most tourists were from Latin America, so surprisingly many shopkeepers and hotel personal do not speak english well.
2. Locals are nice + not pushy sales-wise.
3. Restaurants post prices outside, no hidden fees, no haggling for food.
4. Prices consistent across town (±10%) (at least between the tourist shops).
5. This town is Tourist-heavy, but clean and organized.
6. Hotels/restaurants all use bottled/filtered water → no stomach issues due to water or food.
7. Plenty of currency exchange (even in supermarkets). Many places accept cards.
8. Wi-Fi surprisingly decent and available at every shop we went to.",6,1758904582.0,Machupicchu,1,0.88,False

1nr63xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1nr63xl/dads_stroller_club/,Dad’s Stroller Club?,"Hello fellow SLC’ers, I’ve been thinking about something since becoming a father 4 months ago and I want to see if there’s interest.

I watched some video on an NYC stroller club for dads. They met at some park, grabbed a coffee and got outside with kids and other dads specifically, (no offense to all the moms, you’re the glue that holds things together). 

I was thinking this would be a good way for dads to meet other dads, surround themselves with men in a similar situation, or find a shoulder to lean on if you’re a dad feeling like you’re on you’re own. 

This would be a no pressure, take a walk for an hour or two in a park around the valley kind of deal. Parks could be rotated.

The focus would be connecting dads with other dads. Whether it’s just an hour conversation per week, the motivation to get out of the house when life feels hectic, or a way to seek fatherly help and advice, it could be what you want it to be.

Open to anyone and everyone. 

Would dads in the valley find this interesting, helpful, or would it potentially just fizzle out because everyone is too busy? I thought about just starting small within my sphere of dads and soon to be dads and see if they boys want to hang with the kids for an hour. Hoping it would grow eventually. 

Here’s something similar to what I saw in NYC.

TL:DR I had all of my teeth replaced with implants and now I can't look at myself in the mirror.

My teeth have always been bad. When I was a kid, my mom was super strict on my dental care, and I'd have 5 or 6 cavities every visit. Instead of stopping and saying ""Hey, that's weird,"" my dentist would just yell at me that I wasn't taking good enough care of my teeth. Then came the braces. My orthodontist would tell me I was being a baby when I cried because he was too rough and made my gums bleed (which they did, all the time). I had braces for 2 years, had them removed, and put back on for reasons I cannot explain. After about 5 months with the second set of braces, my orthodontist called my mom in a panic and said the braces had to be removed, NOW. He explained that I had a rare side effect to the braces that caused the roots of my teeth to disintegrate, and if they didn't remove the braces it would cause my teeth to fall out. We had no reason NOT to believe him, so we did as he instructed.

It snowballed after that. I kept getting more and more cavities. When I was in my 20s, I was accused of doing drugs by a dental hygienist, because of all of the tiny rotting spots on my teeth. I was getting filling after filling just trying to keep up, but it got to the point that it was too much for me and my new family to afford, so I stopped going to the dentist. I fell into a deep, dark depression, and eventually attempted suicide. By the time I was 35, I stopped smiling. All pictures of me after then are closed-lipped. I became so self-conscious that I didn't want to talk to anyone. I had a very customer-facing job at that time, and all I could think about was how much of my rotting teeth were showing when I talked. Honestly, COVID was a blessing. Masks allowed me to be myself in public again. I could laugh loudly, smile brightly, and just be ME. It was wonderful.

When I was 38, I was at a conference out of state when the worst happened. I developed a BAD abscess in a tooth that was on the verge of just falling apart. I stayed up all night in pain, searching for an emergency dentist who could fit me in, and finally found one, in a super bougie part of the city. I knew what I was walking into - judgement. But that didn't happen. They were so kind. I cried when I explained why going to dentists made me so nervous, and that hygienist hugged me and told me that I was beautiful, and my case wasn't even the worst they had ever seen. When the dentist came in, he took one look at my teeth and told me I had a birth defect - Amelogenesis Imperfecta, basically meaning the enamel on my teeth never formed properly. He explained that my orthodontist had lied - my roots were perfect. When he removed my braces the first time, he pulled all of the enamel off of the front of my teeth. And when he put the braces back on, he put them on my now completely exposed and unprotected teeth. Once he figured it out, he had to say SOMETHING to cover up the fact that he didn't notice I had zero enamel. And what's so funny is that not a SINGLE DENTIST ever contradicted him. Nobody ever told me my roots were fine. It was in my damn chart that I had ""disintegrating roots,"" but nobody ever said anything. In the end, this dentist that I had never met, in a city I had never been to, listened to me and ended up saving my life.

He told me that all of my teeth had to go. My mouth was a constant source of infection and it was keeping me immunocompromised. But I was still relatively young, and did not want dentures, and had no way to pay for implants. So he removed the abscessed tooth, and I left. But the idea of reconstruction stuck with me.

2 years ago I was in another dentist's chair with another abscessed tooth when he told me that time was up. The rotting had gotten so bad that I was going to end up getting an infection in my jaw that would travel to my brain or heart and that I could die. I went home crying that day, because how the hell could we afford to fix this? Even dentures are expensive, and we're not exactly rich, so my husband and I started digging. We spent months meeting with oral surgeons, researching options, and scouring through government websites for dental grants (which are few and far between, by the way). My health insurance wouldn't cover this, because even though it was a birth defect, it's still dental. We didn't qualify for any of the grants. It was going to cost $85,000 to have all-on-4 implants done here in the US. Our dental insurance would cover half of the cost of dentures, but only up to a certain point. I eventually gave up.

Last year I was scrolling Reddit and came across a post about dental tourism. They said they got their implants done for a THIRD of the cost overseas. We started digging again, and realized that this might be possible. I researched clinics in Mexico, Turkey, South Korea, Spain, and finally found the perfect fit in Hungary. We spent months trying to find the money. We got a home equity loan that covered a huge chunk, but we were still short thousands. My husband created a crowdfunding page, which I didn't think would do anything, but boy, was I wrong. It spread - my colleagues at work chipped in, shared it, and then their families and friends chipped in, and eventually we had what we needed to cover the entire procedure. Extractions done here in the US, temp dentures during the healing, and dual all-on-6 implants done at the clinic in Hungary. After all of these years, I was FINALLY going to be free of this.

The extractions were worse than I could've ever imagined. The pain was excruciating. 25 teeth pulled all at once. I was in so much pain I ended up out of work for over a week, and had to work remote for another week after that. My face was a mess - bruised and swollen. The temp dentures were too big, so I couldn't wear them. They had screwed them up so bad that I looked ridiculous. Even after having them completely remade, I still couldn't wear them. I just decided that it was easier to stay on the liquid diet for the 4 months of healing time then it was to fight these things, so that's what I did. I wore a mask to work, and that was my life.

Last November was my implant surgery in Hungary. It was night and day different than my experience here in the US.  I was the only patient scheduled for surgery that day, so I had the recovery room all to myself. They didn't kick me out as soon as I woke up like they did in the US after my extractions. They wanted me up, moving around, and drinking something before I could leave. They walked with me around the clinic to make sure I didn't fall. God, they even brought my husband coffee on a freaking silver platter. I had never felt more cared for in a medical setting in my life. That's not to say it was easy - the recovery sucked. I looked like I'd went a round with Mike Tyson. TSA looked at my husband and I very closely on our flight home.

I ended up spending 11 months with no teeth. Even though my dentist in Hungary tried to fix the temp dentures (he actually snorted when he saw them, they were so bad), we just couldn't ever get them to fit right, even with adhesive. But it was ok. I kept wearing the mask at work, eating super soft foods, and eventually I felt better than I had in years. The diet I was on forced me to lose the 65 pounds I really needed to lose, and since the source of the infection was gone, I was no longer sick all the time. But I was anxious pretty much every second of every day. I had read horror stories about implant rejection, so I was in and out of my stateside dentist's office for x-rays to check to make sure everything was ok. He, however, made sure I knew just how pissed he was that I didn't let him do the implants, even though he knew I couldn't afford them here. He's no longer my dentist.

This May, we traveled back to Hungary for the 3rd time and I finally, FINALLY, got my new teeth. All-on-6s on both bridges, zirconium appliances, the works. After 2 weeks of adjustments, they screwed them in (a super weird sensation) and handed me a mirror. I had prepared myself for this - I knew they would be different. I knew I would look different. I knew there would probably be some dysphoria. But even the mental pep talk couldn't prepare me for the sheer FEELING that swamped me. I could only look in the mirror for about 3 seconds. It wasn't me. The person in the mirror wasn't me. I smiled, my husband got teary-eyed, my dentist was pleased. He shook my hand, said he'd see me in a year for my checkup, and out the door we went. I went back to our rental and I sobbed. Even though I KNEW I was going to look different, that doesn't prepare you for the mind-fuck of actually LOOKING different. I knew it would take time, and I would eventually get there.

And now we're here. It's been 4 months since the procedure. I can eat and drink normally. My recovery has been as close to perfect as I could've imagined. No rejection, no infections, nothing. I can even play the wind instrument that I was afraid I was never going to be able to play again. And objectively, my new teeth are beautiful. They're not perfect, but that was by design. I didn't want Hollywood teeth. People who meet me can't tell that they're fake. When I've told people, they're beyond shocked. I was called hot by a random person the other day lol. But I still can't look in the mirror for longer than a few seconds. The last few months I've been able to compartmentalize - I don't look in the mirror for longer than I have to, and then I just live my life. I smile at people, I laugh out loud, and I'm finally ME again in public, as long as I don't think about it.

The other day I saw a selfie I had taken of myself, trying to reacclimatize my brain to this new me, and all I saw was ""FAKE TEETH,"" like a flashing billboard. I've been in a major depressive episode since. Overall I am so, so, so happy with the results - I honestly couldn't have gotten better. I guess I still need to grieve the death of Old Me. There's no going back to that. The Other in the mirror is Me. And I don't know how to reconcile myself to that. I'm afraid I'm never going to be able to see myself smiling ever again.",1,1758904345.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I won’t send it through the wires.  
But if you ever feel a sudden stillness,  
A hush in the room where laughter used to live,  
That’s me.

I miss you more than I can say.  
Not just your voice, but the way you listened.  
Not just your touch, but the way you held space for me.  
I love you.  
I always did.  
I always will.

But I’m leaving.  
Not with a slam, not with a scream.  
Just a quiet closing of the door.  
No one will see me go.  
But it will be felt.  
In the way your morning coffee tastes different.  
In the way the air forgets my scent.  
In the way your heart searches for mine in the silence.

I hope you find peace.  
I hope you find someone who makes you whole.  
And I hope, in some quiet way,  
You’ll remember me not for the leaving,    
But for the love.",2,1758904341.0,u_Last-Hope-7585,0,1.0,False

Edit: I’m referring to SeaTac 

We’re Centurion Lounge people but the waits have been atrocious which isn’t great with a 3y/o, so we decided to give the C lounge a try with my new Atmos passes (got in under the wire for Q3). With each pass you’re allowed one adult and up to two kids under 21. **They scanned my boarding pass and were able to pull up the passes**

The lounge is clean and quiet, and wasn’t too crowded at all which was great. As far as food/beverage options go, pretty basic. Scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, couple different oatmeals, bread station, fruit etc, coffee, OJ. I didn’t try anything alcoholic because I’m with my daughter and we didn’t have a lot of time. The pancake maker thing it pretty cool, my daughter loved watching it. Coffee machines are the same as the Centurion Lounge.

Overall I think it’s worth it to use the passes. Probably what we’ll do is if we have them available use them if we’re in a rush since there’s no wait and it’d be close to our gate, or if the Centurion Lounge waitlist is too long. I wouldn’t pay for an annual pass though. ",4,1758904279.0,AlaskaAirlines,7,0.76,False

With traffic, I was expecting to be back right around 3:50. There is a french bakery with great coffee on my way home. I felt like I needed a pick me up, and my nanny also loves coffee (and pastry from this bakery because I have taken her before).

So I texted her - ""I'm kind of up for some coffee and pastry, what about you? Do you want some? I can get us both something but I'll be a few minutes late.""

Her reply was literally ""yes, I'd love some coffee and pastry, can I have the vanilla latte and chocolate almond crossiant?

I got back at 4:10 pm and thanked her for staying late and gave her the coffee/pastry. She was initially happy and thanked me and then reminded me to pay extra to her weekly pay for staying late. (I wrote in our contract that I will pay when late and arouded up to the 15 min mark).

I told her the coffee and pastry was around $15 and she shouldn't be asking for extra. She said I was still late - and I said it was with her preference in mind too because I did offer to come back on time and then I could have taken my kid to the bakery shop without her.

What is the normal protocol for situations like this?

edit: She left at 4;10 actually, so I probably got back around 4:05, the late fee would be 6.25\*",7,1758904222.0,Nanny,118,0.64,False

I am currently searching for an upgrade for my  delonghi dedica ec685 and found the Rancilio Silvia. I’ve read some reviews but I’m not sure if I should buy it or not because it’s quite a few years old. I’m wondering if there are any newer and better options in this price segment (600 - 700€)

Also, I was wondering if I should upgrade my current grinder. Currently I have a sage smart grinder pro and maybe it’s too ”weak” for a mid range machine. Do you think I should also upgrade my grinder if I’m going for a Sylvia or something in a relatable price group?

For those of you of you who already have the rancilio Silvia: how satisfied are you? I’m a bit concerned about the temperature surfing if I have to make more than two cappuccinos. Even though I currently had to do that with my DeLonghi aswell but because it is a thermoblock it was probably easier(?) I am mainly making coffee for myself and my partner, not for larger groups but it’s sometimes happens. How was your experience with that?

I've been reading and listening to podcasts with advice about training  and fueling and ""don't do anything new on race day"" has come up a lot.

I think that makes a lot of sense. My longest run so far has been 12 miles, and I know I still need to practice with some things because for double that I will need more fuel and water than I've been using so far, but my plan for water will be to use what they give at the race. So is it okay to stop a couple of times during training runs to buy a water? (I run past a few convienience stores). I just run with a belt and hold the water in my hand so to me this makes the most sense, but I'm not sure.

Another thing is timing. My race that I signed up for starts at 4:30 am. Is it worth it to start my runs that early to practice? I'm used to leaving at 5:30/6. But maybe I need to practice even earlier, since I take a while to get ready? (I like to have a coffee and digest it before leaving to run).

1nr5yj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1nr5yj9/eyeless_brandon/,Eyeless Brandon,"A month passed, and the relationship between Sandy and Brandon was beginning to show, though mostly on her part. Brandon still resisted attracting more attention, fearful of the bullies, while Sandy started receiving looks and comments that could complicate her life.

From afar, Ann watched Brandon sitting alone on a bench, isolated between the hallways, while Sandy, excited, handed him something.

—Now I see how these weirdos multiply so fast —laughed one of Ann’s friends.
—What does she see in him? —asked another.
—He’s just as weird as she is —Ann replied.

—I want to know why she does all that for that antisocial guy —Ann said thoughtfully.
—I wouldn’t lift a finger for a man, ugh. I like being spoiled; I’ll just give my body —added another, and their shrill laughter echoed down the hall.

Alex was nearby, listening from a corner. His face showed pure rage; he cursed silently and disappeared before anyone noticed.

Sandy continued laughing in front of Brandon, handing him a small gift, while he put on the white mask. Instantly, everything changed. The shy, reserved boy seemed to transform. His eyes, black and empty behind the mask, gained a disturbing gleam; it was as if he could see the deepest thoughts of those around him.

Ann felt a chill run down her spine. The pressure of Brandon’s gaze was overwhelming, as if the entire world had disappeared and only the two of them existed. Without understanding how, she knew he was reading her mind. Her breathing quickened, and trembling, she decided to leave, followed by her friends.

Sandy tried to speak, worried:

—Brandon! Are you listening to me?
He slowly turned toward her, watching through the expressionless mask. One hand gently stroked one of her thighs, the other wrapped around her, pulling her close. Sandy froze, unable to move, while he lifted her legs over his and continued caressing her gently, never taking his eyes off hers.

—Brandon… this is… not allowed… —she whispered, but he ignored the warning, keeping her pressed against his body. One look was enough to silence Sandy. She had never seen him like this: always distant and cold, now dominating the space around him.

Alex, from his corner, watched angrily and muttered to his followers, while Brandon’s mask intensified his presence.

—Do you think no one will say anything if you wear it at school? —Sandy asked, jumping slightly at the warmth of his hands.
—Brandon, stop… —she tried to pull away, but he gently pressed his fingers into her skin, forcing her to stay.

Completely flushed, Sandy managed to slip away through the hallways toward the girls’ bathroom. Her heart raced as she recalled Brandon’s warnings: keep gestures of affection outside of school.

When she arrived, she saw him standing near the boys’ bathroom. Rigid, with a firm posture and a tilted neck, he waited. His presence was intimidating and strangely precise; Sandy didn’t understand how he had gotten there first.

—Did you get here first? Do you have wheels on your feet? —she laughed nervously, trying to lighten the situation. —I’m going to pee…

Before she could move, Brandon grabbed her arm and pushed her against the wall, his breath muffled by the mask. Sandy was trapped, unable to move. Her heart raced; the warmth of his body seemed to radiate fire.

—If they call the principal, it’ll be your fault —Brandon whispered in her ear just as the recess bell rang.

He stepped back slowly, and Sandy ran off, completely red, murmuring:

—I’ll see you after school…

From behind one of the columns, Ann had seen everything. In class, after Brandon removed the mask to avoid problems with the teachers, the world returned to its normal rhythm: the classroom’s white light hurt her eyes, and the sounds were annoying and stressful. But something had changed: Brandon, without the mask, still emanated that aura of control and danger. No one dared to get in his way, and he felt a slight dizziness, as if the world itself had become a little heavier… or more his.
That morning, when Sandy questioned him about his strange behavior and how what had happened put them at risk, Brandon looked at her, surprised, and denied everything.
We were sitting on the bench the whole time, he stated, in a firm but strange tone.

They were both at Sandy’s house. Her parents were at work, and the silence of the home seemed to amplify every word.
You’re lying, she replied, pouring orange juice for both of them.

Brandon frowned. He didn’t understand. In fact, he didn’t remember how he had gotten to the classroom; it was as if a void had erased the path, leaving only the sensation of being there without understanding how.

Sandy got up from the couch and wrapped her head with her arms. Brandon remained still for a moment before gently wrapping her waist and returning the hug. She wore a tight black sweater and a knee-length skirt that hid her legs, with matching tights.

If you want, she said suddenly, sitting on his lap and taking his hand, guiding it under her skirt with a gesture he barely understood. Brandon tensed, heat rising to his face, and withdrew it gently.

What’s wrong? Sandy asked, surprised.

Brandon was red, confused, and his long hair partially covered his face so he wouldn’t look directly at Sandy.
It’s just… it’s too soon… we’re at your house… I don’t want to disrespect you… I…

Sandy lowered her gaze, blushing as well. The atmosphere became awkward, loaded with silent tension.
It wasn’t what it seemed at school… I thought that…
Eh?
That confused them both.

I… I should go home; your parents might get mad if I’m here with you, alone…

Sandy looked at him with pleading eyes.
You want to leave already?
No… but…
Is it because you don’t want to touch me? I thought you wanted that ever since… you acted weird.

Brandon didn’t understand anything. His head hurt slightly, as if something was stirring inside him. He would never have done anything without consent; he had always waited for Sandy to make the first move. The feeling of being accused of something he hadn’t done disturbed him deeply.

He grabbed his backpack.
Sorry… I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable; I swear I don’t remember doing anything like what you’re saying… I would never disrespect you…

But if you were embarrassed, now you can just be yourself…

Brandon sighed, determined to leave.
Sorry, Sandy, I have to go home. Your parents will be back soon.

She said nothing and accompanied him to the door. He gave her a kiss on the lips; she responded, though with a serious expression.

Oh, right, I almost forgot my mask, Brandon said suddenly, returning to the couch to put it back on. As he felt it on his face, a chill ran through his body. Murmurs and faint whispers seemed to emanate from the mask itself. The voice he heard echoed in his mind:

(You don’t want to touch me, do you? My body disgusts you?)

Brandon felt the rejection, a sting in his chest that wasn’t his own. He knew, without her saying a word, what Sandy thought, what she felt; the mask seemed to amplify and project others’ emotions toward him. He lifted the mask slightly and gave her another kiss, but Sandy barely reciprocated. The embarrassment overwhelmed him; he didn’t know how to express what he truly felt.

See you tomorrow? she said, trying to keep her smile.
Yes… you looked very beautiful today, Brandon replied, lowering the mask. (Too much for just looking at you…)

Sandy smiled, relieved.
Then… see you tomorrow! I’ll talk to my dad so you can stay for dinner, okay?

She hugged him. Brandon remained rigid, not returning the hug normally. When she looked up, she saw his eyes, cold and curious behind the mask, and felt a shiver. Carefully, he took her wrists and brought her closer, as if trying to understand the act of hugging. Sandy, confused but trusting him, mimicked his gesture, wrapping her arms around him tightly.

Be careful, Brandon, call me when you get home, okay? I love you.

He watched her every step as he walked toward his home, silent and unsettling. Sandy sensed that something in him had changed. She closed the door behind him, her heart still racing and a strange feeling of unease lingering in her chest.
Alex was arguing with Ann just as they were planning to go on a date.

You think I’m stupid? I heard you saying you were into Marlon! That weirdo retard? Seriously?

She didn’t answer.

I didn’t say that!

You said… I think he has pretty eyes. What’s wrong with you? You trying to make me look like an idiot or what?

You’re so dumb, basic… look, I can be with whoever I want.

I have a fucking car, a fucking license… what does that loser have that I don’t?

Well, that’s what I want to know, the blonde replied calmly.

You’re a bitch! shouted the blond, pounding on the car door.

They were in the middle of the mall parking lot, and the echo of the shouts bounced off the empty concrete.

You will not disrespect me, hear me? Just because you can’t be with me and can’t keep up doesn’t give you the right, Ann retorted, throwing her cold coffee onto Alex’s windshield.

She walked away, swaying her short denim skirt, each movement intensifying the tension. Alex, red with rage, cursed her.
Damn Marlon, you’re gonna pay for this, bastard!


---

Meanwhile, at Brandon’s house, the scene was different. The living room was overrun by his father’s crowd, a party that felt like a madhouse. Brandon felt absolute rejection toward all these people; each laugh and conversation caused him tension. His hands trembled slightly, the dense air brushing against him like invisible blades.

When he entered the bathroom to shower, anxiety pushed him to keep the mask on for a few more moments. Then he heard a whisper, faint and almost imperceptible, that seemed to mimic his mother’s voice. A chill ran down his spine. The mask, cold and clinging to his face, vibrated with a presence that wasn’t his own, a strange echo that distorted reality and made him feel watched, as if the house itself was breathing with him.

Brandon took a deep breath, trying to ignore it. But the sensation that someone—or something—was whispering foreign secrets to him set his nerves on edge. Every sound from the party, every step on the wooden floor, every sigh seemed amplified, directed straight at him. The mask wasn’t just an accessory: it was becoming a catalyst for his perception, making the imperceptible vivid, disturbing, and almost unbearable.
He turned, thinking he must be hallucinating from exhaustion. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his reflection in the mirror, and a chill ran down his spine: his silhouette seemed to move strangely, independent of his will. With the mask on, he felt like someone else, someone who wasn’t him, and that sensation froze him to the bone.

He showered with hot water, sitting on the floor of the stall, his long black hair tangled around his arms, small cuts and scrapes barely marking his skin. The silence of the bathroom mixed with the constant sound of the falling water, muffling the chaos coming from the living room.

—Brandon? —a voice cut through his concentration, soft, almost a whisper.

He spun around, heart pounding in his throat. Under the roar of the water, his mind searched for explanations; there was no one else. No one. He quickly dried off, put on his black and gray pajamas, and went down to the living room, carrying the mask Sandy had made for him.

The music and laughter of his father’s guests hit his mind like waves of knives. Every voice sliced into him, every laugh resonated with contempt, every gaze heavy with alcohol and false affection seemed to aim to weaken him. His father was nearly unconscious, eyes closed, a bottle in hand. Lydia was grotesquely close to a strange man, laughing and singing like a child.

—Hey, is your son the bottom or the man? —shouted someone, mocking without any respect.

Brandon felt hatred rise like lava in his chest. He wanted to scream, attack, make them all disappear, and in that instant, he heard… not with his ears, but with something deeper, darker: the thoughts of each one of them. Every mockery, every manipulation, every contempt filtered into his mind like an electric storm.

—Why are you wearing that thing? —asked a woman, wobbly from alcohol, getting too close.

Brandon looked at her. The empty eyes of the mask pierced her like needles of ice. Before she could touch the mask, he grabbed her wrist firmly, his nails pressing into her skin. She recoiled, stunned, because she heard in her mind a threat he never spoke aloud:

—Touch me again and I swear I’ll kill you.

The music continued, laughter trying to cover the chill that ran through everyone, but no one else sensed the reality of what had just occurred. Lydia tried to dismiss it nervously:

—The kid didn’t say anything, you’re imagining things —but her eyes betrayed confusion and fear.

Brandon, unflinching, moved away slowly, the mask concealing the vertigo of his newly discovered power. He grabbed the cordless phone from the foyer and dialed a number. When he spoke, he imitated Erika’s trembling voice so perfectly it sounded underwater, muffled, terrifying:

—I want you to come… I’m at a friend’s house… they’re giving alcohol to the kid… he’s underage… please…

No one heard anything over the uproar of the party. Brandon hung up and, with cold calculation, surveyed the room: the drunkards were trashing everything, Lydia laughed uncontrollably, and his father was lost in unconsciousness. Brandon opened the fridge, took a bottle of alcohol, and drank nearly half in one gulp, sweating, dizzy, a heat radiating as if from the mask itself.

He sat near Lydia, turning up the music, feeling the vibration run through his body and mingle with the hate and tension in the air. Every movement, every laugh, every mocking gesture of the guests filtered into him, amplified by the mask. He didn’t just see; he heard the imperceptible, felt the unspoken, sensed the fear they tried to hide.

Then, there was a knock at the door. Lydia, dizzy, opened it.

—Yes? —her voice seemed to regain sobriety.

—Does Mr. Michael Nightshade live here? —asked a police officer.

Confusion overtook Lydia; her laughter froze, her smile disappeared. Brandon remained in the living room, motionless, breathing heavily under the mask. When the officer requested to come in, Brandon rose, moving slowly, calculating each step, each gesture, as if the mask itself had transformed him into someone else.

As the officer approached, Brandon lifted the mask to his lips and exhaled, sending his breath over the agent. The mix of cold, alcohol, and something indescribably disturbing made the officer stop.

—His breath… smells of alcohol —he said with a grimace of disgust.

Brandon smiled faintly behind the mask, a smile no one else could understand: he was playing, manipulating, and knowing that for the first time, he had absolute power over the perception of other
The scandal from the previous night still echoed through the house. Michael had to pay a fine he didn’t know how to avoid, while Lydia argued heatedly with her ex-husband, and everyone present tried to explain the inexplicable. Brandon, for his part, remained silent, watching from his room.

That morning, he had made a cold, calculated decision: he posed as a trustworthy neighbor and called Criss’s father, expressing deep concern over the supposed irresponsibility of Lydia and Michael. He described the situation with such credibility that the man exploded in fury, worried that Michael’s “rebellious son” might negatively influence Criss. Lydia found herself trapped between anger and helplessness, while Michael tried to explain what had happened. No one could deny the evidence: perhaps someone at the party had supplied alcohol, but no one wanted to admit it.

Brandon stayed quiet, unconcerned by the arguments around him. He didn’t fully understand how he had managed to manipulate the situation, nor did he remember the details of the previous night clearly. Fleeting fragments crossed his mind, like shadows of memories that didn’t seem to belong to him. It was as if someone else had acted through him, a repressed side now unleashed: calculating, cold, and without remorse.

He skipped school that day. He gave Sandy a false reason to postpone their meeting. She, though disappointed, accepted it without complaint.

—No one gave you permission to drink alcohol! What’s wrong with you, Marlon? Are you stupid or what? Do you know the fine you’ve gotten us into? —Michael shouted, exasperated.

—You should have thought about it before bringing those people who insisted nothing would happen —Brandon replied with a calm that chilled the blood.

—You’re underage! Look at the trouble you’ve caused us! —his father stepped toward him, furious.

Brandon smiled. For the first time in years, he felt no guilt, no fear. Nothing. Just a cold emptiness where obedience and respect once lived.

—The trouble… you’ve always been in —he said, his voice dragging centuries of resentment.

His father’s slap barely brushed his cheek, a useless attempt to make him react. Lydia looked at him with frustration and disappointment, but Brandon was no longer there. His gaze had turned cynical, piercing, as if everything that had held him back until now had evaporated. Only pure hatred remained, an energy ready to explode.

He went upstairs, pausing briefly to spy on the scene. Erika, the woman who had mocked him, was being confronted by Michael. Her voice trembled, but she tried to deny any involvement.

—Erika, they have the call, from our own phone! That’s your voice! Why didn’t you tell us my son was drinking? And who gave it to him? —Michael roared.

—I-I never called the police… you’re crazy! It’s your son! Your son is a demon, with his voices, with that horrible mask! He did it! —Erika replied, her fear evident at Brandon’s presence in the house.

—Do you want us to go to the station so they can give us proof? —Michael added, furious.

—Go, Erika, this is very disappointing for us —said Lydia, though her voice lacked conviction.

The woman looked at them, confused and stunned, wondering how all this could be happening and why no one believed her. She grabbed her bag and left, leaving behind a silence heavy with tension.

Brandon went up to his room quietly, his mask concealing the radical change taking place within him. Inside, no trace of doubt or fear remained: only a deadly calm and the promise that nothing would ever be the same again.
He turned, thinking he must be hallucinating from exhaustion. Out of the corner of his eye he saw his reflection in the mirror and a chill ran down his spine: his silhouette seemed to move strangely, independent of his will. With the mask on, he felt like someone else, someone who wasn’t him, and that feeling chilled him to the bone.

He showered with hot water, sitting on the floor of the stall, his long black hair tangled around his arms, small cuts and scrapes barely marking his skin. The silence of the bathroom mixed with the constant sound of the falling water, muffling the chaos coming from the living room.

—Maybe I’m going crazy, he thought.

At night he dreamed nightmares. Of his mother, dead, but standing on the road, begging him to come and give her a hug. And of the man who had fled that night. His face barely recognizable, but the way he smiled—cruelly—stayed with him.

Brandon stole a bottle of alcohol from his father.

He sat on the ground, sunk into his silent mind, tormented by voices that said things he didn’t understand.
“Your father… Brandon… My boy… Your father…”
It sounded like an echo, like his mother’s voice, her tormented voice. He could no longer tell if that voice was his, his own thoughts, or someone else’s.

A black truck passed by.

Brandon remembered where he had last seen that car.

Instinctively, he got up, and the car headed toward the hill, almost driving away completely.

Brandon followed, slowly but surely. As if a force guided him there. Whether for something good or something bad.

His vision grew slow and blurry as he continued his walk, broken by the whispers.
I must… I must be too fucked up to realize, he thought.

At night he had nightmares. With his mother, dead, standing on the road asking for a hug. With the man who had fled that night, his face almost unrecognizable, smiling cruelly.

He kept walking away from everything until he reached almost to the edge of the woods.

He felt like someone else was following him, while he tried to track the car. Maybe two or three. He felt them close, heard the soft crunch of leaves, sharper than any human sound.

He felt their breathing.

Between the trees, he looked at the road. The car was heading to an unknown destination. Behind the trees, Brandon began to reel. Voices spoke to him, instincts warned.

All they did was complain.

His hearing ramped up to the maximum when he felt them grab him abruptly from behind and throw him to the ground.

—Look who got lost in the woods! —Alex and his cronies jeered.

—What’s that shit you’ve got on your face, huh? Stupid weirdo!

The other two laughed as if Brandon were a cockroach, reduced to worse than spit.

He tried to get up, and Alex kicked him in the stomach to keep him down.

—Hold this faggot.

The other two grabbed handfuls of his long hair and struggled to pull it all into one hand.

Alex pulled out a pair of scissors.

—Please… don’t do this, Brandon begged, almost inaudible because of the mask.

—Without your fag hair you’ll lose the little self‑esteem you have, won’t you?

Alex threw the scissors to one of them and he cut the hair, and suddenly started shearing it off.

Brandon tried to wriggle free, but Alex had no mercy.

Half his hair was taken, and after mocking him as if he’d done some heroic act holding the soft, disheveled strands, he tossed them on the forest floor.

Brandon cried on the inside, behind the mask. He began to feel the mask wanting to adhere more to his skin, heightening the discomfort.

He wanted to scream, do something, defend himself.

Alex bent close to his face.

—Ann said she likes your eyes… that you have pretty eyes. You’re so stupid to think you have a chance with her.

Brandon felt sick; he felt the voices, this time louder. As if they were screaming—with rage and torment. His head felt like it would explode; he wanted to kill them all, wanted everything to stop.

—I don’t know what you’re… talking about… Please… let me go… he said in a tone between hatred and tears, begging for his life and for what little dignity he still had.

—Isn’t that whore behind you enough? Alex snarled so close to his face, with such contempt, that Brandon felt profound disgust; he knew he would collapse from a punch if Alex kept at him.

Brandon swung a fist into his nose, almost making Alex fall backwards onto his butt.

—You defend that freak? She’s as pathetic as you are, he managed to say while wiping his blood.

He pulled a ballpoint pen from his pocket, and while the others beat him, he said:

—I don’t think you’ll have pretty eyes for Ann anymore.

And, in an irrational act, he shoved it into his eye. They hadn’t been able to remove the mask while they were grappling and beating him, and still, Alex caused such atrocious damage even with the mask on.

Brandon’s scream of horror rang through the desolate woods, and he fell unconscious when they let go of him.

—What did you do?!
—You idiot, you killed him, you hit him with that!?

Alex’s companions shouted. Alex, still buzzing with adrenaline, breathing heavily, tried to process what they had just done.
After staring at Brandon’s silent, rigid body for several hours, the three of them grew nervous.
“Enough, you stupid Marlon! I swear if you’re faking this I’ll make sure to kill you, and then I’ll go after your stupid girlfriend.”

There was no response from the inert body.
“Why is it like he’s looking at us?!” one of them said nervously, seeing how, every time they seemed to move, he followed them with that cold, terrifying gaze, one eye still bleeding, the pen still embedded. The mask was splattered.
“This is fucking terrifying! I want to go, because he’s talking!”
“What’s wrong with you? He’s dead, can’t you see? Dead!”
“He… he’s talking to me!”
“Shut the fuck up, idiots, let’s get out of here. Nobody’s going to say anything, nobody will open their mouth! You hear me?”

The three ran off in panic, grabbing the scissors and leaving Brandon alone among the dry leaves of the woods.


---

Sandy was at home doing homework.
She felt depressed: Brandon hadn’t attended classes and the loneliness weighed on her. Her parents weren’t home; it was already past eleven at night. After finishing her chores, she thought about relaxing with some TV and poured herself a glass of juice.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door.
She went to the foyer and looked through the peephole.
“Brandon?”
He stood there, hunched, his neck crooked. His hair dirty, clothes stained with dirt, and the mask splattered with blood.

“What are you doing here so late?” she asked. He came in, watching her intently, smelling something she recognized immediately on Sandy: her perfume.
“What happened to your clothes? That’s blood!”

He shut the door behind him, and Brandon remained still, inspecting the house as if he saw it for the first time, as if entering a forgotten museum.

She brushed the dirt off his back and legs, removing soil from his dark overalls.
“Why is there blood on your mask?” she said, reaching to touch it.
“I… fell…” he murmured.

Sandy removed the leaves from his hair, which despite the mess smelled good and was intact.
“Where have you been? Where did you fall?” she checked every detail. His sweater also had dirt on the elbows.
“Around…”
“Around where, in a pit?” she joked, noticing the blood on his fingers.
“Did you get hurt?”
“No.”

She tried to take the mask off him to clean it.
“Let me?”
He suddenly stepped away and ran into the living room:
“I’m hungry!”

He sat in front of the TV like a child, watching without taking his eyes off the screen.
“Brandon, what are you doing?”

“I’m hungry! What did you make to eat? What’s there to eat?”

Sandy wanted to laugh. What seemed like an innocent game soon turned disturbing:
“What do you want to eat?”
“What did you make to eat?!” he repeated, hugging his knees to his chest, rocking frantically.

She went to the kitchen. She took out dinosaur-shaped fried chicken and noodles in a container to reheat.
“MOM!” he shouted, and Sandy froze.

“What?”

“I don’t like this show! Change it!”

She took control of the TV, but he stopped her, squeezing almost her wrists:
“Leave it! There, there!”

When Sandy tried to continue with dinner, he climbed onto her, cuddling like a child.
“Stay and watch with me, mommy.”
“Stop joking like that!” she tried to get up, ignoring the microwave.

But Brandon was now sitting normally, steady. Sandy placed the plates and began to eat.
“I thought you were feeling sick? Why did you come all the way here?”
He didn’t answer.

He came closer, smelling her:
“Do you like my perfume? My mother bought it for me yesterday.” He smiled timidly, without taking his eyes off the screen.

“You should take off the mask to eat…”
He crawled in front of her, blocking her view.

“What’s wrong with you! I can’t see. Stop, Brandon, I’m not playing, could you say something… This isn’t funny anymore.”

He lunged at her suddenly. They struggled; Sandy understood what he wanted, but it was no longer fun. This wasn’t the shy Brandon she knew: he seemed like an animal, his instincts and libido altered, with a worrying strength.

He calmed for a moment, stopping his aggressive grip on her wrists, bringing his face dangerously close to hers. Sandy thought it was her chance and lifted the mask slightly to look into his eyes and kiss him.

“WHAT IS THAT, OH MY GOD, BRANDON?!”

What she saw was not human: a macabre, deformed face, like a thousand faces fused together, smiling with lust under the dim light. His tongue—black, viscous and elongated—looked rotten, trying to lick her face.

Sandy screamed and tore the mask off, throwing it to the floor. She dropped to her stomach and ran a few steps, leaning against the wall, breathing heavily. Brandon was sitting on the floor, his hair covering his face. What seconds before had looked like black liquid dripping from his tongue was gone; he only watched her with fear.

“It’s the mask…” he murmured.

She looked at the birthday gift on the floor, terrified.
Brandon washed his face and dried it with the towel Sandy had offered him, aware of every glance she cast from the living room. Though he knew what he wanted to do, something else seemed to be in control; his laughter in front of the mirror was nervous, strange, almost desperate.

—All I have is madness… —he murmured, touching his face, surprised that there wasn’t a single scratch despite everything that had happened.
—My God, what’s happening to me? —he laughed nervously.

Sandy, uneasy in the living room, felt an impulse to take the mask she had made herself. If what Brandon said was true, what was happening made no sense. Her mind spun, a slight headache forming as she held it. In front of the mirror, she put it on.

Immediately, she felt her blood pressure drop and her hearing distort; her mind was overwhelmed. Behind her, her heart raced: nine spectral figures materialized, silent, floating in the room. Sandy was scared, but with Brandon nearby, her terror seemed manageable.

The shadows moved with restrained fury, running and expanding through the space; some pale, others putrid, others deformed; all with Brandon’s face. It didn’t seem like they wanted to harm her, but they fluttered, observing her, confusing her senses. Breathing inside the mask became increasingly difficult; each sinister being seemed curious, trying to touch her.

Brandon stood, motionless, while she approached. He quickly removed the mask from her face.

— I saw them —she said, her voice trembling.
— Saw what? —he replied.

She hugged him, trembling.
— They’re here —she continued.

He held the mask firmly.
— They’re part of you… now… —he murmured.

A sob escaped Brandon. He lifted his gaze; he tried not to appear weak, but he couldn’t hold back the tears.
— I’m so sorry… if I wanted to do it, but… I didn’t want to hurt you… I just… I don’t know what’s happening to me —he choked on his cry, bringing his hands to his face.

Sandy held him tighter, not letting go.
— Whatever it is, it’s okay —she replied—. Just don’t leave my side, okay?

— Don’t be afraid of me… please… I won’t hurt you… —he stammered through tears, repeating that he didn’t want to harm her.
— I won’t go anywhere if you don’t —she said, gently taking his face in her hands—. This is the first time I’ve seen you cry and show your feelings.

— I’ll never do it —he cried out.

They shared a kiss, reciprocated. After a long embrace and mutual apologies, they agreed to see each other again to try to understand what was happening with the mask. Fear was present, yes, but together, nothing affecting Brandon terrified them as much as it would have if they were alone.

— You’re not a monster. People just want to take care of that. —she said.
— I didn’t want to hurt you, Sandy… I just… —he stammered.
— I wanted it too —she replied.

She silenced him gently, bringing her hand to his cheek.
— It wasn’t your fault.

They stared at the mask in silence. Sandy called a taxi.

When they got into the car heading home, she warned him:
— Don’t wear it.
— I want to see you tomorrow, to be with you —Brandon said suddenly. Sandy blushed; he never spoke like that.

As the taxi drove on, she cleaned up all the mess and waited for morning, aware that tomorrow would be a new day, full of questions, fears, and possibilities",1,1758904164.0,Creepypastastories,0,1.0,False

With traffic, I was expecting to be back right around 3:50. There is a french bakery with great coffee on my way home. I felt like I needed a pick me up, and my nanny also loves coffee (and pastry from this bakery because I have taken her before).

So I texted her - ""I'm kind of up for some coffee and pastry, what about you? Do you want some? I can get us both something but I'll be a few minutes late.""

Her reply was literally ""yes, I'd love some coffee and pastry, can I have the vanilla latte and chocolate almond crossiant?

I got back at 4:10 pm and thanked her for staying late and gave her the coffee/pastry. She was initially happy and thanked me and then reminded me to pay extra to her weekly pay for staying late. (I wrote in our contract that I will pay when late and arouded up to the 15 min mark).

I told her the coffee and pastry was around $15 and she shouldn't be asking for extra. She said I was still late - and I said it was with her preference in mind too because I did offer to come back on time and then I could have taken my kid to the bakery shop without her.

So was I an AH for not wanting to pay her extra? I might pay her anyways but I'll definitely not be bringing her more things or treating her out... depending on the mood, maybe even get a new nanny?

\*minor correction: she left our house at 4:10, and for 15 min, it's $6.25

  
UPDATE: I sent her the 6.25 but I will not be buying her treats or meals in the future (which historically was costing around 30-40$/week as I always included a take out for her when I got it for my family or brought her along when I felt like eating out on my days off/when I worked from home).",0,1758904145.0,AITAH,95,0.5,False

so much has happened, and my ""dont forget list"" is longer and longer. jesus christ, it just wont stop will it?

so, the latest, biggest fight that affected me the most happened. a few weeks ago, when we had his kids for the weekend. usually how it starts, cause his fucking kids. we left in the am of saturday a few weeks ago to go get breakfast stuff while the kids still slept at home. (they are of age, and sleep till noon.) 

On the way to the store, husband asked me what i ""thought"" about having his kids stay till monday, and I would walk them to the bus stop. Now, mind you, a few weeks prior to this, there was another big fight over you guessed it, the kids and his ex wife (ill tell you if you wanna know) , so im still up in arms when he asked this. he hadnt talked to his ex wife about this, but came to me first. i said i didnt care, whatever he wanted. he got pissed. like, more pissed than i have seen yet, but again we were in a car so...

we get to the store, i tried to explain things, that i was slightly weirded out because of the huge fight we had where he screamed at me to not help him and to stay out of his fucking business. so now hes turning around and asking me for a favor. and i did indeed use the word favor, which set him off. he parked at the store, got out and paced and got back in the car. my phone was recording even before we got in the car. 

anyways, he thought i was saying no, and he spiraled into the usual defensive, to angry to incomprehensibly angry. to the point where he was screaming and his voice was cracking. and we were in the car, so im scared already. i hate cars as it is. i stop recording, to video record, and when he notices, he slaps th ephone out of my hand to the floor of the car, i grabbed it and continued for a second or 2. all in all it was 27 seconds of his screaming and hitting the phone out of my hand screaming he didnt consent to recording him. i said i didnt care, we were in the car it was for safety.  his knuckles were white from clenching them in fists. and shaking from anger. 

We drove all the way home, where he decided to go back to the store, only to decide he didnt want me ""winning"" so he was going to drop me off at home. but then he soon realized that i would be at home with his kids. alone. so i got shit for that, saying he didnt trust me with his kids alone and that he was going to stay there and go when they get up. 

i shut down. we got home, i shut down. i sat down at the dining table, right infront of the kids bedrooms, and drank coffee with sunglasses on, while he circled me like a shark. biting me with every fucking remark or comment or question. they were awful. berating me and belittling me. me not responding. and him telling me im giving him the silent treatment and all that shit. he went as far as taking down or wedding certificate that hangs on the wall above our bedroom. because he didnt want the kids to think we were still going. still together. then he put it back up because he didnt want them to ask questions. to which i said i already was going to tell them it feel and broke. 

i let him go off. i went into the bedroom and he followed. for the next 2 1/2 hours he was spiraling, blubbering, crying, and in the end asked, so i need therapy? and i knew right then that he is using that question as a stop to the conversation. his version of ending it on his terms. i tell him he needs therapy every single time we fight. this time was the worse. this time he touched me. he apolizied (i think) but, it still didnt make any fucking difference in me. or how it made me feel. 

and as small and insignificant as him hitting my phone out of my hand, was probably the worse thing that has happened, and thats saying a lot. that affected me more than the not communicating, the berating and the overall hatred i feel from him. it could always get worse now. he did that, whats stopping him from something else? hes already punched holes in the wall, broke my shit, kicked my shit, threw shit out of the shed that was mine. like, the possibility is there and its scary.

Mostly started for the health benefits and to help treat my chronic inflammation, but the slight weight loss has been a bonus as it makes me feel less puffy and gives me some muscle definition. 

I started with a 48 hour fast and I truly felt amazing — woke up with no pain/inflammation for the first time in years, had energy, mental clarity, and went from 109lbs to 105.6lbs in 48 hours (I’m 5’1).For awhile after that the benefits were consistent, but I slacked a bit in the middle of the summer and when I tried to get back into it, I’ve had nothing but struggles and haven’t noticed any of the same benefits. 

I’m about to complete my first 72 hour fast and I’ve felt horrible during most of it. Extremely exhausted, brain fog, and lots of pain. I do have more acute inflammation this time around from clenching my teeth overnight, but otherwise I don’t understand why everything is bad now. I also started at 109lbs again but now, at 65 hours, I’m only at 107.8lbs. Last time I could literally see the puffiness go down and noticed extra definition, but now I’m not seeing any of that. It feels like I’m holding onto extra water for some reason, and I’ve also noticed a lot of trapped gas. I’ve had similar symptoms the last several fasts I’ve tried. All I’m having is water, electrolytes, black coffee, and herbal tea. I had a sip of pickle juice yesterday to see if it would help with my energy, but that’s it. 

Is my BMR/metabolism messed up? What can I do to fix this? I’m on the verge of just giving it up because it no longer feels beneficial, but I’m super bummed because it was working well for so long. ",1,1758903943.0,fasting,2,1.0,False

I think there is a better way to do this that maintains your dignity and that also help vet the man.

On occasions where I've had men suggest a low effort date. I have two go to responses:

1. ""Thank you for the invitation, but that is not the type of date I'm accustomed to.""
2. ""Never mind, if it's too much trouble for you to plan an appropriate date, perhaps we're not a good match.""

Nine times out of ten the man will step up right away and do the right thing. If they don't you have your answer.

I also feel a date should be in line with the age and income level of the man. I have dated wealthy professional men as well as blue collar guys. I expect them to plan and pay for a date proportionate their income level. If I know they are making an effort I am happy.

I hope this doesn't offend, but in my opinion flat out asking to be taken to dinner is a bit tacky. I think there are better and more dignified ways to let men know our expectations.",3,1758903928.0,sprinklesprinkle,6,1.0,False

1nr5pc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nr5pc2/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_kissing_my_best_friend/,I can’t stop thinking about kissing my best friend even though I have a boyfriend,"Okay so I need to get this off my chest because it’s eating me alive and I literally can’t tell anyone in my real life.

We just got back from a trip through Italy. It was me and my boyfriend, plus another couple, my boyfriend’s friend from uni and his girlfriend. that friend? He’s one of my best friends from school. Like… we go way back. We sat next to each other in class, we’d walk home together, we were always the “everyone thinks they’ll end up together” pair but we never did. Wrong time, wrong place, wrong everything. Life just moved on. We both got into other relationships, but we always stayed close.

Anyway, in Florence we checked out of our Airbnb in the morning, flight wasn’t until late. We left our bags at a storage spot near Santa Maria Novella (seriously a lifesaver, I would’ve lost my mind dragging suitcases all day). So the plan was just: explore the city, kill time.

We started wandering as a group but eventually split. My boyfriend wanted to hunt for some vintage shop, his friends girlfriend wanted coffee, and suddenly it was just me and him. And it felt… weirdly natural? Like no time had passed. We were walking through the streets joking about the same dumb stuff we used to joke about at 16. I caught myself smiling at him the way I shouldn’t have.

We ended up down by the Arno, just sitting on some steps. Talking, laughing, teasing each other. At one point I shoved him for saying something stupid, and he grabbed my hand like he used to in school, just holding it for a second longer than necessary. My stomach flipped. I kept thinking, this is not okay.

But then he put his arm around me. And I didn’t move. I just leaned into him like it was the most natural thing in the world. And it felt… comfortable but also electric, like my whole body was on edge.

And then I looked up at him and he just looked back, and we kissed. Soft at first, then not so soft. Ten years of “what if” poured into it all at once. His hand went to my hair, then the back of my neck, pulling me in. I swear I forgot where I was for a second. All I could think was: this should’ve happened years ago.

We stopped because someone walked by, and I had this wave of guilt crash over me. I have a boyfriend. He has a girlfriend. They were literally minutes away, and here we were kissing like we’d been waiting our whole lives for it.

But then it happened again. And again. Every time we tried to stop, one of us leaned in and started it back up. It wasn’t just a kiss, it was years of unspoken stuff finally spilling out. My chest was tight, my hands were shaking, and I hated how much I didn’t want to stop.

Later that evening, all four of us met up at the luggage storage, picked up our bags, joked around like nothing had happened. I wanted to scream. I wanted someone to notice. But nobody did.

And now I can’t stop thinking about it. I feel like an awful person, and I know if I told anyone they’d rightfully judge me. But I can’t lie, part of me doesn’t regret it. Part of me wonders if we finally crossed a line we were destined to cross anyway.

I hate myself for it, but I also can’t stop replaying it in my head.

**What is it?**

This is a contest run by members of the community. We are not officially associated with Coffee Stain Studios although I've heard rumors they find us amusing and a bit confusing.

**THIS SUNDAY (SEPT. 28) AT 2pm UTC -** JOIN US TO PLAYTEST THE FIRST LEVEL WITH 64 PLAYERS. Level by u/XSEIDET. Crash our server if you can. Come have fun. We will be sharing links to join the server shortly before playtesting goes live.

**Right now - October 15th (submission deadline)**

[Join our discord](https://discord.gg/D6kj3DHqcu) and help us build a giant factory cart obstacle course tower. Yes, it's like that other famous tower in that popular racing game, just funnier. If Discord isn't your thing, you can also read the rules and submit by checking out this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a2knVxDEnuNFTjzANJR-j9PmFF5oGgvrIdXYeFH-pj8/edit?usp=sharing)

**November 1st - TBD:** We launch our tower climb as GIANT MULTIPLAYER EVENT with 64 players per server. We couldn't homelab something this big (we tried), so we are very happy to announce that we have ~~sold our souls to~~ been working with [Indifferent Broccoli](https://indifferentbroccoli.com/satisfactory-server-hosting) to make this happen.

Those of you who know the origins of this event - picture us trying to explain all of this to an actual company. lmao.

**November 5th - TBD:** We launch the single player time trial mode where folks can compete for first place. Thank you to SirDigby and Andre Aquila for creating the mods we needed to make this possible.

**First place prize:** An official Ficsit Coffee Mug...and maybe some other stuff ;)  
**Other prizes:** If you ain't first you're last but we might be able to get something together for you.

The easiest way for us to keep this operation moving is if you [join our Discord.](https://discord.gg/D6kj3DHqcu) It's really fun, we are hiring tons of people from the community with all kinds of expertise, and you can play around on our monstrous homelab server for free with a bunch of other folks.

This is first time I am posting on this subreddit though I am not new to screenwriting. I would love a fresh pair of eyes on my short screenplay. 

I had submitted this screenplay as part of a competition a while ago. 

Title: Death by Cocktail 

Genre: Mystery  

Pages: 11 

Logline: On a misty Coorg coffee estate, a rookie detective races to uncover a wealthy businessman’s killer among his bitter family before her seniors snap up her first big case.

I have also included the synopsis for the story as well (under 100 words). 

It was certainly a fun challenge to write this screenplay. I wanted to write a compelling Knives Out-esque mystery grounded in a hill-town in India. Sticking to page limit and planting clues early on was definitely a challenge for me. (If anyone is curious, I was inspired by MrBallen's video for the whole murder mystery MO) 

Drive link: 
[Death by Cocktail](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JaoyGTSqqFKnFJ-lDA5xbcAoexVR5Xyo/view?usp=drivesdk)

I appreciate any feedback you can give on my short screenplay. I would love to know what's working and what isn’t and welcome any suggestions to refine it. 

(Also quick disclaimer: **Please do not upload it to any AI platforms**)
