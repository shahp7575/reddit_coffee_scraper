Bonjour! Long time lurker, first time poster. Just wanted to share a pic of my collection so far as I just got a couple of new perfumes for christmas (replica coffee break, chloe, and soda snob full size).

I grouped it with my more floral/classic perfume scents on the left, the more tea/food/sweet perfumes on the right and... \\\*drumroll\\\* in the middle are my 2 special favorites, bvgalri green tea and origins ginger essence. Those 2 are perfumes that my mother wore all the time, and smelling them helps me stay close with my memories of her. I always wear the bvlgari when I need some extra courage.

Also, and I know there are a couple scents in here with it, but i DETEST jasmine, especially if it's overpowering. If it's well balanced, like the valentino, I can enjoy, but anything to jasmine forward is a no from me.

Anyone have any green tea, or tea scents in general to reco?  I am going to try to dossier citrus matcha next, does anyone have an opinion on le monde gourmandes the matcha?

Also! anyone know of a dupe for tom fords soleil neige? Maybe the only TF sample I have that sticks with me.

Another one on my desired to try list is the diptyque vetyverio.... but who has the $$ for that LOL!

I have questions…,"Decided on a whim that I wanted to try a 24 hour fast. Hoping to cut sugar cravings, heal my gut, lose some excess fat I’ve had from have two babies in the last 2.5 years. I am not overweight but i would like to be slimmer.  It went well! I had grilled chicken  for dinner at 6pm on Monday night, fasted all day Tuesday with only black coffee and plain tea and water. Ate breakfast again on Wednesday. 

It was a little annoying to fast but not difficult. Didn’t feel very hungry until Thursday morning when I woke up and broke the fast. 

So I’m hoping to do 36 hour fasts with 5 days of eating in between. My only concern is that my digestion isn’t doing very well today after the day of fasting. I had very loose stools all night after I hit 24 hours and then even this afternoon after breaking my fast I’m having loose stools again and it visually looks like my breakfast ran through me in 6 hours. My stomach feels gurgly and i have not felt hungry again since breakfast, though I did eat some salad with chicken for lunch. I broke the fast with a handful of blueberries and avocado on sourdough with two eggs. After eating this I had about a half a cup of coffee with honey and a splash of milk.  

I am wondering if I continue to fast regularly if the loose stools will continue or if my body will adjust. Should I be breaking the fast with certain foods to avoid the meals running through me? Is this pretty normal? If so, is it healthy? My worry is that I didn’t absorb any of the nutrients as it went through so fast. I hadn’t had blueberries in over a week so I’m positive this meal went through my system in 5-6 hours. ",1,1736372914.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

Anyway, when I was in fifth grade, me and my grandma moved to a complex house, we live above while her boyfriend live below. 
It was a cute small apartment with two bedroom, a bathroom and had a window that overlook the driveway and there’s a door in the kitchen that goes up to attic.
Just a few weeks after we moved in, my grandma have an old radio station on the table in the kitchen and it doesn’t work but she likes it so she use it for decoration. 
One night, I was woken up by a very loud noises, I have little bit of hearing left in my left ear so I could hear it but couldn’t make out what it was. I saw my grandma rushing down the hallway and so I follow her into the kitchen. The radio’s light was on, like greenish light and it sound like static. She couldn’t turned it off and sign to me to unplug it, I checked. It wasn’t plug in. 
It finally stopped a few minutes later. 
Around thanksgiving, me and my grandma went up to attic to get some Christmas stuff.
The attic is small, very narrow and you could see outside through a little window. 
I had an uneasy feelings and didn’t want to stay up there because I felt like I will be grabbed. There was a door that’s completely bolted on the other side of the room. 
Few days pass, my grandma was at work and wanted me to go up. 
I was nervous and bit afraid but forced myself to go.
I went upstair to the attic and saw the door was not bolted, it was wide open. 
I had a feeling that someone was looking directly at me, and suddenly there was a loud thud behind the door, I just ran down the stair and locked the door. 
It got worse for a week, I was waking up feeling like I was being held down. 
The footsteps in the hall got louder and there was banging on the wall. 
I would joke with my grandma that the ghost knows that I’m Deaf. 
Well, uh, my bed was shaken for few days, scaring me out of my slumber and I was losing sleep. 
The final straw was when I was sleeping, I had a bookshelf with dolls on it just across the room. My bed was shaken and I suddenly felt something falling on me. 
Three of my glass dolls fell on my face, I definitely had bruise for days from that.
My grandma once woken up to the sound of her step dad calling her by her nickname, her step dad died when I was three turning four. So this definitely shook her up because she could even smell the old cologne that he would always use along with smell of coffee. ",2,1736372878.0,TrueScaryStories,0,1.0,False

Building a SaaS should be about solving real world problems, right? But how can you create innovative solutions when you are trapped in a bubble where the biggest inconvenience you face is your favorite coffee shop running out of oat milk?

Meanwhile, founders in places like Estonia Vietnam or Georgia are busy creating global products. They are tackling challenges and succeeding, all while you are recycling ideas at yet another networking meetup with the same dozen people who think Slack is the gold standard of innovation.

Heres a suggestion: pack your bags, move somewhere different, and immerse yourself in the kinds of challenges people outside your comfort zone face daily. Or, you can stay put and keep wondering why your so-called 'innovative' SaaS has three paying users and a churn rate that’s climbing faster than your Twitter follower count.

I grew up in a Jack Mormon family, so I didn't relate to a lot of them. For instance, never called a coffee table a hot chocolate table mainly because my parents drank coffee and were not ashamed. 

On the other hand, we did some things that looking back did not make much sense.  Anyone else grow up in a Jack Mormon family?

* I grew up before the three hour block, so Sunday School was in the morning, Sacrament meeting in the evening, and Primary was during the week after school.  I attended Sunday school and Primary, but would only attend Sacrament meeting for the Primary program.  Otherwise, I thought it was optional.
* We had a rule that we couldn't go to movies on Sunday unless there was at least a shred of religious content.
* Even though my parents drank coffee, I was not allowed to drink cola drinks because of the caffeine.
* Our family reunions always had a blessing on the food, a talk about our pioneer ancestors, and plenty of ice cold beer, but no sodas with caffeine.
* Babies were blessed and children baptized, but the ordinances generally were not done by family members. 
* I later found out the hard way that there is a real difference between Jack Mormons and exmos.  I made the mistake of saying something bad about one of the general authorities.  To be honest, I was surprised that my family member even knew the name of the GA.
* They revered the Salt Lake temple but thought that going in was something that other people did.  We would periodically visit temple square as an extended family and sit through the videos in the visitors center. ",1,1736372703.0,exmormon,3,1.0,False

Log weight in Libra and share here: 377.4 lbs, 378.2 lbs trend weight. Fine and dandy.  

Fruit or veg with every meal, dessert once a week: Nailed it today. 🍌🍎 for breakfast, 🫐🥑🍐 & veggie pasta with lunch & 🥦with dinner.

Still under my current maintenance. But it’s a bad habit I'm trying to curb. And it’s over calories for my eventual goal weight. Every day is an opportunity to improve so none of that this evening, self!       

Don’t spend $ outside of preset weekly budget: On it. Still knocking out my 2025 budget.  

Find a way to enjoy moving my body everyday: TBD hoping to hit this up when I get home. 5/8 days.  

Today's gratitude or laugh list: Today, I’m grateful for access to fresh fruit and vegetables. I laughed at the Regulation Podcast.  

Meditate (sensory grounding) for 5 minutes to combat hyper vigilance: Got it. Will probably do this again before bed.    

Self-care activity for today: I did duo lingo while I waited for my coffee this morning, I journaled a bit during lunch & I’m hoping to have some time to draw tonight. And early to bed with me!

I recently obsessed with a mid-century modern coffee table and have done a tons of research, plus purchased some items and experience myself as well as gathering reviews from my friends. 

Here are my take of mid century coffee table choices from popular brands like West Elm, Article, Wayfair , etc...

1. West Elm 

[https://www.westelm.com/products/mid-century-storage-coffee-table-acorn-h4542/?position=3&sbkey=default](https://www.westelm.com/products/mid-century-storage-coffee-table-acorn-h4542/?position=3&sbkey=default)

[Price : $599 + shipping ](https://preview.redd.it/v8s9d1zo7ube1.jpg?width=140&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5a2db73f61147a7b7a40bf2e8460eee32377f8a)

Looks good, seem sturdy, got storage but not solid wood entirely (mdf top + veneer and solid leg) . Length 47.5 in . Good size. The color is a bit too yellow for my taste

Rating: 3/5 for price vs value 

2.  Article 

[Price: $399 + shipping ](https://preview.redd.it/g0do5ll88ube1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5c1c1c9090d9400ff085aa4797126ae744759f7)

The look is more refined but not solid wood entirely also  (mdf top + veneer walnut and solid leg). However, walnut veneer is generally more expensive and valuable than the one of West Elm . 

Length is 53'' . Good length size and the finish looks like real walnut.

Rating: 3.5/5 for price vs value 

3. Wayfair

[https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/wrought-studio-sabornton-40-wooden-coffee-table-with-drawer-walnut-w005759037.html](https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/wrought-studio-sabornton-40-wooden-coffee-table-with-drawer-walnut-w005759037.html)

[$210 free shipping ](https://preview.redd.it/pvwczd9x8ube1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9021eba1bf712def8ebd7de23fe2ea03c60eeb45)

Definitely more affordable option but materials is not as high quality  (mdf + veneer) . This table is 40in length (so smaller than the one of Article & West Elm) 

Rating: 3.5/5 for price vs value 

4. Harmonie Workshop

[https://harmonieworkshop.com/products/mid-century-modern-coffee-table](https://harmonieworkshop.com/products/mid-century-modern-coffee-table)

[$289 Free Shipping](https://preview.redd.it/4efy305h9ube1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d84f9de289a18f0465d58cf2f4e8f190c7be6263)

This table is made of solid wood, no veneer which is a plus point. 46in length is a good size too. However, this brand is kinda new compared to the other three. 

Rating: 4/5 for price vs value 

If you’re considering a mid-century modern piece for your home, a coffee table is a great place to start. Has anyone else here embraced mid-century modern in their home? Would love to hear your thoughts and see your setups!

I am here with an **updated** version of my previous reviews. I took some feedback to improve the readers experience. 

Background: Evidently, I am a twenty year old male. I have recently become infatuated with the art of perfumery. Though I am new to this world, I decided to review fragrances through my fairly inexperienced nose. I have really enjoyed writing these, but more importantly, spending my time with new fragrances.

I hope you enjoy, and I really appreciate you all! Thanks!

**DOLCE & GABBANA:**

*Pour Homme Intenso:* I had received this fragrance in a sample vial along with some others I had purchased. I didn’t look anything up before testing it, but I didn’t hate it. It sort of has a “blue” opening, in my opinion. It definitely smoothes out over time. It did have more complexity than I was expecting from a D&G scent. It is not something to write home about but it isn’t bad either. My co-worker thought it smelled like, “man.” Take that how you will. Personally, I had a hard time figuring out the notes. Performance was good with about 6-8 hours of longevity. Not bad but not special. **(5/10)**

**DIOR:**

*Tobacolor:* This is a beauty, truly. I, at this point in my journey, have tested a lot of tobacco scents, and while this is not the sort of tobacco I gravitate towards, it was *intoxicating.* The plum in this scent is deep, decadent, and smooth. Mixed with the tobacco, it makes for a luxurious aroma. I usually stay wary of the conversations around “date-night” or “special-occasion” scents, as I think it important to wear what you like, but this is an exception. It is something I would personally reserve for those occasions. I (20M) found myself in love with this scent, and, though I think people ought to wear what is an extension of themselves, this may be reserved for a certain age. I was won over by *Tobacolor*, but even I questioned if it was a bit mature for my image. Overall, this fragrance is smooth, incredibly well blended, deep, rich, luxurious, balanced, and intoxicating. The performance is incredible. **(9/10)**

**LOUIS VUITTON:**

*Nuit de Feu:* This fragrance pleasantly surprised me. It is not one that I would typically go for, but I had a free sample so I gave it a day out. I initially smelled what I perceived as black pepper. That's what my brain picked up, can’t help it, you know? Anyways, once I got the black pepper idea out of my head, the incense came out quite nicely! It was dark and smooth. I thought: “lightly sensual.” The dry down was even better, in my opinion. It became a tad sweeter and smoother. I asked my co-worker what she thought (I made sure not to reveal the official notes before she smelled them to avoid preconceived ideas) and she smelled a smoky, dark vanilla. Not a *smoky* smoke, but an *incense-y* smoke. Overall, this is not a scent I would typically wear, but it was very nice! Contrary to reviews, performance was good! 7am-2pm longevity. Price is... \*side eye\* Though it is not bad, it is not within my personal preference for a scent. **(7/10)**

*L’Immensitè:* I love this scent. I always have and always will. It was one of my first “big” purchases. I was fairly young at the time, so it has a special place in *here* \*puts hands to heart\*. Anyways, enough of the sappy stuff. In all honesty, this scent is very straightforward. I think LV gets a bad rep, being a designer line and all. And let’s face it: the prices are deterring at best. BUT! It is a GREAT summer scent. Easy, fresh, citrusy, bright, a tad spicy, and very wearable. The ginger and grapefruit are uplifting and energizing, but the scent is grounded with the amber notes. Overall, I think this is a wonderful addition to any collection. Performance is great (longevity & projection). Price and bias deduct points. **(9/10)**

*Afternoon Swim:* An orange. But, a scrumptious one! This scent is a big, plump, sweet, juicy, tangy, and citrusy *orange*. There is not much more to it than that. It is GORGEOUS in the summer. I am not always the biggest fan of orange/citrus fragrances but I want to frolic in orange groves when I smell this one. Longevity lacks compared to the other LV fragrances and the price is... well, the price. BUT! Simply, delectable. **(7/10)** P.S. If anyone knows where I can get samples of *Cactus Garden* or *Sun Song*, please let me know! Thanks!

**GEIR NESS:**

*Geir for Men:* Though this is a simple and relatively inexpensive fragrance, I haven’t smelled anything like it… yet. Anyways, it has a BEAUTIFUL, fresh, floral note. Not the traditional stuffy floral note, but a “rushing cool breeze blowing through the wildflowers of a glacial Norwegian mountain” kind of note. That’s what it smells like to me. I actually think it works equally well for all seasons. The coolness of it allows for a nice summer scent, but the floral note with a HINT (and I mean a HINT) of spice makes it alright for winter. I like this scent because it’s an easy wear and not too pungent or “blue,” but still exceedingly fresh. It's like the cleanest mountainous glacial air you’ve ever breathed.  It has good projection for as long as it lasts. I would say that it is medium-low for longevity. Price is very reasonable! **(8/10)**

 **ZOOLOGIST:**

*Camel*: The dried fruit is prominent in the opening. The fruit exits soon after, leaving an eastern smell, that of; frankincense, amber, incense, and spices. There is a slight *funk,* or animal quality to this fragrance, rightfully so. It then settles into a plain, lightly sweet, incense. Nothing crazy, but still holding onto the notes that give it an eastern world vibe. I found this scent to be less complex than other Zoologists but still nice. The least performing of all Zoologists I have tried, it didn’t last nearly three hours. Personally, not for me. **(3/10)**

*Civet:* Oooooooo, BABY! What a beautifully underrated perfume. *Civet* completely intoxicated me. Why, you may ask? Well, you see, this fragrance is deeply complex. Its combination of roughly 25 different notes and stellar performance make it a standout. The opening is spicy, aromatic, floral, and, seemingly, gone too soon. This fragrance transforms into something beautiful and unique. The notes swirl around, revealing themselves with each whiff. For example, the coffee wasn’t “coffee,” it was used as a tool to darken the fragrance, making itself known, but very discreetly. The many, *many* other ingredients work harmoniously to create a vintage-inspired, timeless, slightly animalic, woody, musky, sweet, and dark masterpiece. I thoroughly enjoyed it. While I love it, someone said it smelled like church at Christmas, in a good way… Whatever that means. Luckily, this is MY review. I am happy to smell like whatever church that was. Great longevity and projection, it seemed. **(9/10)**

*Squid:* I was very intrigued to sample this fragrance, as I have seen how polarizing it can be. Truthfully, that shocked me! I found *Squid* to be very wearable. Unique, yes, but still wearable. I find the composition of this fragrance to be interesting because the notes work to create a completely different image in your mind, from what they really are. For example, if you hadn’t told me there was incense, I would not have known. In my view, the incense added for a slight sweetness, and mixed with the other notes, almost created a thick ink-y or seaweed effect. It was interesting. *Squid* is very; deep, dark, liquid-y, mysterious, and alluring. Like a Squid. Crazy, right. Overall, I enjoyed this.  Performs moderately. Good for maybe one reapplication throughout the day? **(8/10)**

*Rhinoceros:* The opening threw me off, it was very pungent. If I wore it out, I am sure it could be off putting for others, though after about ten minutes it becomes something *beautiful.* Before I get there, though, let me explain the opening in more detail. It was definitely boozy, but very dry and bitter. I actually enjoyed the uniqueness of not being a sweet booziness. I think the perfumer leaned into the bitter, dark side of coffee. The basil is a nice touch, and the leather was raw and rough. Okay, now for the exciting part. I must preface by stating: I still have difficulty identifying the nuanced notes in fragrances, so if what I’m explaining is incorrect, please let me know. Through the bitter, rough, dry, “hide” of *Rhinoceros*, there came this faint sweetness. It grew as the fragrance settled. I believe it was the ylang ylang, maybe the sweet grass, though I don’t have a solid understanding of that profile yet. The tobacco is a nice addition. Together, the composition is incredibly smooth. I enjoyed this experience immensely. The longevity was well over eight hours and the projection was good. **(9/10)**

*Musk Deer:* Considering Zoologist’s unabashed, continued creation of funky, boundary-pushing, realistic fragrances, *Musk Deer* is quite tame. I, like many, hold Zoologist in high regard for their ability to give us realistic takes on the concept of creatures roaming this planet, not swayed by the opinions of what’s, “nice”. Historically, musk deer glands have been used as an ingredient in perfumery, leading me to believe *Musk Deer* would be something very similar: animalic, musk-y, and not particularly crowd pleasing. That is not what I experienced. The opening was very nice; cardamom and calamus oil created a unique, green opening. Minutes later, rose creeps its way in, remaining quite prominent for a long period of time. The powdery note from the rose was off putting and, frankly, unwanted. Once the powder subsides, the sweetness of the rose is bearable, especially in unison with the newly found woods that have entered. The fragrance ends on a very well-blended, woody, sweet, sensual note. Still, not very “musk deer,” if you ask me, but a nice fragrance overall. Longevity is great and projection is mild. **(7/10)**

**PENHALIGONS:**

*Halfeti:* Arguably one of Penhaligon’s most famous fragrances, and rightfully so, *Halfeti* is just right. With the perfect blend of woods and spice with a touch of citrus and rose, rounded off with the sweet smoothness of nutmeg and cardamom, *Halfeti* leaves little to be desired. On the top you get a spicy-citrusy opening. Later, it smoothes into a woody, seductive, spicy fragrance. On the tail end of each whiff, sweet nutmeg rounds the fragrance off. It is a romantic but adventurous scent, one that I truly enjoyed. Moderate performance at around 6 hour longevity. **(8/10)**

**MAISON FRANCIS KURKDIJAN:**

*Oud Satin Mood:* You guys, I must be honest with you….This is my guilty pleasure. The one… the only… OUD SATIN MOOD!! \*crowd cheers\* It’s fair to say that I love this one, I cannot lie. There is just *something* about it. Firstly, I am not going to try and explain what OSM smells like, because I don’t even know, I just like it. The notes say it’s floral heavy (roses, iris, violet) with oud, but I just smell something I wanna eat, or bathe in, or something… The oud must only be part of the name, because- where is it? I see a lot of women review this scent, but I’m a guy and I think this is a straight up knockout. I JUST WANNA GOBBLE MY ARM OFF!!! Sorry. Ahem- I have found it to be quite polarizing. Some say it smells like grandma, and some say they, too, want to eat me up. Respectfully, of course. Anyways, I’m not sure what else to say. I like it, and I know fragrance is subjective, so, because of my not-so-in-depth review of OSM, take this rating with a grain of salt, as I am very biased. STRONG performance and projection, WOW! **(10/10)** (again…I’M BIASED)

*Oud Silk Mood:* As you can see, I adore *Satin Mood,* so I was excited to try her sister, *Silk Mood*! *Silk* and I do not get along. She’s the ugly sister, or something. I found her to be a lot more “rose-y” than *Satin*. NOT the delectable rose in OSM, but more of a traditional, lighter, and almost, *empty* rose. There are many different roses in the fragrance world, so different strokes for different folks, I guess. I will say, *Silk* was lighter than *Satin Mood,* but still smelled like, “rose,” the whole time I wore it. I feel that *Satin* has more depth. Or I’m biased. Oh, well. Didn’t last as long as *Satin* but still lasted a solid 7 hours. **(3/10)**

**VERSACE:**

*Eros Flame:* \*sighs in defeat\* I am embarrassed to put this on my list, but I have to be honest with you all, and it is one that I have tested, which means I can review it, despite *Versace’s* unpopularity in the fragrance world. I wore this scent for about a year straight. Jail, I know. In all fairness, I was very young. This was my VERY FIRST ever fragrance. Think: teenage high schooler. You get the type. Anyways, it's a lot. It is very strong and has a spicy, peppery, citrusy kind of chemically smell. Works well for autumn. Intense, with has that uninteresting crowd-pleaser scent. I cannot wear it anymore because it really can make you go nose blind. Breathing it in after a pump too many will cause a suffocation. The projection is nuclear, and the longevity, from what I remember, is good. Burns your nose hair off. **(2/10)**

**LE LABO:**

*Iris 39:* This is now a boutique exclusive and I am happy I was able to test it! Firstly, *Iris 39* is definitely an iris scent. It has a sweeter, fresher opening and settles into a nice, powdery, classic, sort of scent. As the day went on, I noticed it became *slightly* darker, a bit woodier/muskier. SLIGHTLY, though, the powdery-ness was still prominent. If you enjoy a classic kind of fragrance, with notes of iris/violet (that remain powdery), you might enjoy it! I want to note; I am a guy who enjoys darker, tobacco filled scents, so this was way off in left field for me, but my nose likes what it likes, what can I say! This performed wonderfully. Stayed on for 8+ hours! **(7/10)**

*The Matcha 26:* This one surprised me! It started off pretty green and herbaceous, which was expected. What surprised me was the creaminess of the dry down. Matcha/tea notes, I find, can be slightly bitter, but I didn’t find that to be the case with this one. It blended very nicely. You are left with a nice, creamy cedar note that comes out quite well. I found this fragrance to be warm, earthy, alluring, slightly aromatic, and woody, but still green? I hope that makes sense. It performed fine, but not well enough for the price. **(8/10)**

*Santal 33*: I wanted, I hoped, I *prayed* for this fragrance to come through… welp. I know this fragrance is highly favorable among many, and I am so, so happy for you if you reside in that camp, truly. But I do not. The opening hits me with iris, undoubtedly. Then, almost immediately after, I get this weird… *funk*. It is the weirdest thing. It’s not wretched, but most certainly not favorable. I will say, it is not the “pickles” y’all be talking about, but it was still funky. It wasn’t until two hours later, on the dry down, that it smelled fine. Nothing crazy, just *fine*. It was now a slightly sweet, woody sort of scent. Overall, this frag did not work for me, and that’s too bad because I was really rooting for this one :( It lasts a while but I didn’t want it to, the top/heart notes last too long for how funky they are. (**2/10)**

**JOHN VARVATOS:**

*Vintage:* I really enjoy this fragrance… for as long as it lasts. It is no secret that JV’s fragrances have poor performance, so I will stick to the actual scent profile. The word “vintage” could deter a lot of people from this fragrance, as it is usually associated with powdery/barbershop/non-mass-pleasing notes. But *Vintage* doesn’t have those qualities. It is a surprisingly favorable scent among my collection. Firstly, it has many gorgeous notes. The opening is fresh and aromatic, but over time, it settles into that nice and smooth; tobacco, suede, spiciness, woodiness, slight booziness, but remains aromatic and fresh. It has all the qualities of smelling like a time that has passed. I enjoy this fragrance because if I don’t know what to wear I know I can reach for it. It is versatile, but still unique. Not to mention, the price is affordable. Poor performance. Needs more than an average amount of sprays and lasts maybe 2-4 hours? Expected. **(7/10)**

**GUERLAIN:**

*Honey Tobacco*: Honey on the opening is strong and very honey-like. And that’s it. I seriously just smelled of honey the whole way through. The longevity wasn’t special, nor was the projection. If you like honey, great! Buy this! The realest honey fragrance I have ever smelled! It confirmed that I do not, in fact, like honey fragrances. At all. I will say, there may have been clove and anise hiding on the underbelly of this scent, and MAYBE, just maybe, even the tobacco came through… slightly. But, wow, that honey really punches your nose. Performance was fine. Not great, just: *fine.* Overall, ew. **(1/10)**

**ORMONDE JAYNE:**

*Ormonde Man:* The opening on this fragrance is spicy, crisp, and aromatic! JUNIPER!!! The notes describe it well (you can look them up). The dry down, in my opinion, is where the magic happens. The woody/musky, but still fresh, blend is beautiful. It is masculine, aromatic, grounded, and smooth. I like it a lot, which is UNFORTUNATE because the performance wasn’t up to my standards. Tragic, y’all. Tragic. It didn’t last as long as it should for the price. NOW! If you don’t mind reapplying, don’t let that deter you. **(7/10)**

*Tolu*: The opening was brilliant! It was crisp, unique, modern, fresh, amber-y, and dazzling. I really enjoyed it. Now, this fragrance has one of the most distinct changes from the top -> heart notes of any fragrance I have tested yet. It was constantly evolving, but not too quickly. I was truly able to smell each note profile as time went on. Here is the deal: The opening was gorgeous… BUT! The dry down became too heavy on the florals for my liking. However, make no mistake… When it says the heart notes are; rose, orchid, and lily-of-the-valley, you’re gonna get; rose, orchid, and lily-of-the-valley. Though I didn’t like the floral notes for myself, they were light, sweet, and airy… classically feminine, in my opinion. The base does contain, what I smelled to be a, frankincense-y, amber note, though, the floral notes linger. It’s interesting because the opening was completely different from what the fragrance evolved into, which is wonderful, and quite spectacular, but not all of the notes were for me. Frankly, performance lacked. Strength and longevity decline after an hour or two. **(5/10)**

**BOIS 1920**

*Classic 1920:* Intrigued by the notes of apricot and basil, I was excited to try *Classic 1920.* The opening is bright, showcasing the juniper and bergamot, a slight bitter, but aromatic profile of basil, and a nice dash of spicy sweetness from the nutmeg. As time passes, the fragrance fades into a nice, classic, slightly barbershop fragrance. The florals in the middle keep it sweet, but not too powdery, in my opinion. It remained fresh. On the base, the fragrance grounds itself with some woodiness, though not overwhelmingly. On my skin, it stayed pretty fresh and sweet throughout its lifespan. Speaking of which, the longevity and projection are not great, maybe 4-6 hours best? Not abysmal, but not particularly substantial, unless you don’t mind reapplication. Overall, this fragrance does have a classically posh, gentleman-like feel to it. **(6/10)**

**HOUSE OF BŌ**

*Infinitoud:* Truthfully, I got my nose on this because I needed a filler for the month of December on my ScentBird subscription. Now, I have made my fair share of mistakes in life, but this, ladies and gentleman… this was not one of them. I was completely taken aback by how much I enjoyed this fragrance. It was simply, *incredible*. The opening is beautiful. Based on the described notes, one could assume this is a very woody, earthy, natural fragrance from start to finish, and while those aromas may reveal themselves later, that is not the case in the opening. The peyote and myrrh, in unison, create such a unique, fresh, aromatic, herbaceous, sweetness to the top of this stunning fragrance. Later, as expected, the fragrance melds into a woody, seductive, oriental scent that exudes sophistication and discretion. The longevity is good and the projection is not beastly, which I prefer. Overall, I am over the moon to have found this, though I cannot say the same about the price… **(12/10)**

**ARAMIS**

*Havana:* I am still hoping, one day, I will be able to own a bottle of *Tobacco Reserve.* However, until then, I was satisfied to try *Havana.* Inspired by the Cuban city itself, I expected certain things: a classically masculine aroma, prevalent tobacco, and a timeless feel. While the tobacco is understated, taking a back seat to other prominent players, the timelessness and masculinity made themselves known. The mandarin, basil, and spiciness on the opening is pleasant and fresh. The carnation is a key note in this fragrance, giving it a classic, floral, sweetness, almost reminiscent of a fougère. Overall, *Havana* is a fresh, classic, masculine, and timeless fragrance. Its longevity is good. The projection is beastly at the beginning, but clams down over time. **(8/10)**

**LORENZO VILLORESI**

*Atman Xaman:* I will start with what I know: The longevity is great and the projection, though not beastly, is noticeable, and becomes intimate over time. I will admit, I had a hard time pinning this fragrance. I was eager to try it, as it’s noted to be tobacco heavy, but it was not what I expected. *Atman Xaman* had an old-world, dusty, forgotten, slightly pungent smell to it. I reminded me of an ancient library, but with a warm, sandy, desert, mysterious undertone. It was not deterring, however, like I’ve noticed from Lorenzo Villoresi, he takes you on a different ride than you expected. I wish I could pin more of the notes and profiles for reviewing purposes, but I don’t want to be dishonest or lead you astray. My description above is the best I can do. I will say, the mate did com through for me, not overwhelmingly, but it was the only note I felt I could actually identify among the mysterious aroma. Overall, I enjoyed this. It felt masculine and sensual, due to its mysterious disposition. I wonder how many times I can say “mysterious” in a review lol **(7/10)**

*Spezie: Spezie* was like nothing I had smelled before; it really pushed me. Based on its description, I expected a heavily spicy aroma. And that is what I got... well, in one way or another. Let me break this down for you. You see, I break “spicy” down into three categories: 1. Spicy: food that hurts the tongue and makes your eyes water. 2. Spice-filled: tasting/smelling various spices, without the hurt of the heat. Think: cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, cinnamon, turmeric, etc. 3. Spicy (fragrance): spice, in association to fragrance, is usually more crowd-pleasing, aiding other prominent notes in the scent. These could also include cinnamon, nutmeg, etc., but it is less risk-taking. *Spezie* fell into the second category. The first spray knocked me back, not because it was bad, but because it was truly a new experience. I thought I was transported to an eastern spice bazaar. It was spicy, salty, herby, aromatic, and transportive. It is definitely not for the weak of heart, or the conventional “spicy-fragrance” lover. I cannot emphasize enough how real the spices smelled. You could have been holding a bowl of bay leaves under my nose an I would’ve believed you. After the heavy spices died down, you are left with a lighter, spicy, aromatic, sweet/fresh, intimate, scent. The longevity is pretty good. I am rating this off of my preference, but I really learned a lot from *Spezie* and it felt artistic and creative. **(5/10)**

*Theseus:* The opening is fresh and citrusy. It fades into a woody, soapy, lightly floral, and SLIGHTLY spice-filled fragrance. The woodiness isn’t strong, nor are the other notes, in fact, it’s quite a light fragrance, and didn’t seem to last too long. I couldn’t make out many of the listed notes. Mr. Villoresi’s creations seem to each have a unique spice-filled quality, leading me to believe it’s part of the house DNA. That would make sense, considering he uses his travels to the East for inspiration. I’ve already spoken on what kind of spiciness is utilized within his perfumes, you can see *Spezie* above. The longevity was very mild, so was the projection. Not my favorite from Villoresi **(3/10)**

**TUMI**

*Kinetic:* This fragrance falls into the same category as *Eros Flame* by Versace, which I have already reviewed. It has that strong, mass-appealing aroma, one that can make your throat dry if you breathe it in too much. Strangely, my nose got a cola scent upon its first spray. The associations we make with fragrances can be questionable sometimes, but I must be honest. Anyways, after I got the cola idea out of my head, difficult as it was, I tried to smell *Kinetic* for what it was. Truthfully, it’s nothing special. If you have *Sauvage* or those alike, you don’t need this. Comparatively, this one leans a bit sweeter, fruitier. My biggest issue with these types of fragrances is that that they are terribly synthetic smelling. It can feel like you’re inhaling straight chemicals. It has strong projection for about an hour. The longevity is pretty good. I want to note: this is *not* bad smelling by any means, however it is just not for me. **(2/10)**

**DAVIDOFF**

*Cool Water:* The current formulation of *Cool Water* seems very different from what it ought to smell like based on its described notes. It felt a lot more linear than what I am, seemingly, supposed to smell. Let me start off by saying, it is not bad. It has a cool feeling to it (no pun intended). I also commend its contribution to the progression of fragrance, being one of the first aquatics introduced to the world. I think I would’ve liked for it to be softer. It seemed to lean a bit “axe body spray,” which feels sacrilegious to say knowing its spot among the greats. Which is why I must also say, I would love to have given this a true chance by testing its original formulation. Can’t win them all I guess. Overall, the projection is good and the longevity seemed alright. I think (and hope) that the version I am smelling is a victim to reformulation and high demand, causing it to be a lesser version of its original. However, I will be basing this off of what I smelled. **(3/10)**

**4160 TUESDAYS**

*Maxed Out:* At first, I did not care for this fragrance whatsoever. It opened terribly boozy, which was disconcerting, jading my idea of what this fragrance could become. However, after spending more time with it, I fell in love, y’all. In. Love. Here is what I gathered about the smell: The opening is definitely rum-filled, backed up with lime and a hint of coconut. After that, the lime lingers, and the booziness leaves quickly (thankfully). It dries into an extremely sensual scent, in my opinion. The musk in the base is what makes this fragrance a standout. With the lime, coconut, rum, and tobacco, you may assume this fragrance to be gourmand-like. But I promise you, it is not. It does have a slight sweetness, but with the nuances of woods, cannabis, and spices, grounded by the musk, you get a smooth, masculine, and seductive scent. It reminds me of, and seems most appropriate for, a warm summer night, maybe at a classy beach front resort. Warm, dim lights are strung from linen canopies, the moon shines on the ocean, and you can hear the fresh, salty waves just across the sandy beach. A tall, dark stranger walks by, barefoot in the sand, wearing a linen shirt exposing his chest. The light breeze flows through his dark hair as he walks by, leaving a discreetly intoxicating and sensual trail behind him. Phew, is it getting hot in here? I hope that’s enough imagery for you, because that was getting awkward, though I would give my left arm to be him. Because, he is, in fact: *him.* Projection and longevity are good! **(9/10)**

**ANDY TAUER**

*Sundowner:* This one took me for a *bumpy* ride. Upon hearing about how tobacco-heavy this fragrance was, I knew I had to get my hands on it. Christmas came, and with it, so did a 5ml sample of *Sundowner.* Whoop Whoop! I open the vial, take a whiff, and… well, I was unsure. It was not bad, but I wasn’t elated like I hoped I would be. So, as one does, I spent some time with it, wore it out. Luckily, it grew on me. I thought my nose was broken because I had difficulty getting a lot of the nuances described in this fragrance. I could, however, get a very heavy, dry tobacco scent. Then I stopped liking it. Again. It felt very one dimensional. I was getting frustrated. But, wait! There’s more! Today, on my fourth round of wearing it, I am enjoying it! I didn’t realize Mr. Tauer’s approach to fragrance was very heavy on natural, ethical ingredients, a lot of which are oils, essential oils, and absolutes. That helped me understand what I was smelling and appreciate its composition. Overall, I approve of this (not that anyone is looking for my approval). I really enjoy the classic, dry tobacco. The sparkling orange on the opening, for as long as it lasts, adds a nice touch, and I have now begun to identify some underlying notes, such as cocoa. Longevity is good. The projection is not crazy, which I enjoy. **(7/10)**

**FRANCESCA BIANCHI** 

*The Dark Side:* This fragrance opens *very* honey-heavy. If you’ve read my reviews before, you know that honey and I don’t jive. Lucky, the honey doesn’t remain too forward for very long. It was a dark honey, not a light honey, I thought I should mention that. Anyways, this fragrance has a dark, slightly dirty, sweetness to it. The spices are aromatic and fragrant, giving some nice depth and support to the obvious sweetness. Once the strength of the honey subsides, the florals continue the sweetness throughout, though the honey still lingers. The blend from honey to the florals is very well done, it’s hard to notice a distinct change. The incense is noticeable, adding some darkness to the composition. Woods can be detected later, though they aren’t prevalent. The projection isn’t too strong, but the longevity is good. This fragrance reminds me of a night out in a sleazy, underground club, getting drunk, walking home in a damp fog, getting grimy from it. Overall, I enjoyed spending time with this fragrance, but it isn’t to my particular taste. **(5/10)**

*Sticky Fingers:* If *The Dark Side* and *Sticky Fingers* are sisters, the former is the dark one (shocker), and the later is the good sister. Both open with, what I am coming to find, may be Miss Bianchi’s signature. I don’t quite know how to describe it, but they do have similar DNA. Bear with me, but it reminds me of eating spiced baklava. Don’t think “sickly sweet pastry,” but try to envision what it smells like to eat each texture and taste each flavor. Riveting, I know. Anyways, while *The Dark Side* is more dirty and deep, *Sticky Fingers* is lighter. It is still sweet, though instead of deep sweetness, it felt brighter. The florals may help with this, and there is no honey, which can add a heaviness to fragrances. I found this fragrance to be *very* well blended. I enjoyed it more than the former. The projection is intimate and the longevity is great. Overall, not my go-to but a solid fragrance. **(6/10)**

**EIGHT & BOB**

*Nuit de Megève:* I must not tell lies. I must not tell lies. I must not tell lies. This**GEORGE** is a moment that I must remind myself: fragrance is subjective. With that being said, *Nuit de Megève* smelled very heavily of menthol/eucalyptus. That may seem mundane for my introduction, though I implore you to research how it’s marketed, specifically the listed notes. You will notice that the desired effect is quite opposite of my experience. For me, *Nuit de Megève* opened with citrus on the top, though it was a bit screechy. However, what followed was strange. A strong cooling blast of eucalyptus/menthol came through. I cannot explain it another way. Fortunately, I didn’t mind. I thought it was a clean smell. I was able to pick up on some vetiver later, though the cooling sensation was prevent throughout. The projection was fine and the longevity was about six hours long. Though unexpected, I wasn’t devastated. **(5/10)**

*Cap d’Antibes:* Ironically, this fragrance is actually meant to display cooling properties, not the former. The mint is a very nice opening to this fragrance, well-blended with violet and birch. It creates a cooling, aquatic greenery effect, one reminiscent of a coastal shores. There is a nice, classic maritime feel to this fragrance. Whites and blues flash through my mind. On this particular day you may find yourself sailing, or captaining a ship, though the temps aren’t particularly high this morning, in fact, they seem slightly chilling in the wind. The vanilla and incense on the base are comforting, smoothing the rest of the fragrance out, though still not losing the mint and fresh woodiness entirely. I liked how I was able to create a story upon spraying this fragrance; those are my favorite kind. Longevity was fine and the projection was actually pretty good. **(7/10)**

*Egypt:* The lavender and moss in the opening were quite beautiful. It’s funny how two simple notes that can be found in hundreds of other fragrances suddenly become something special if composed well. The lemon follows after about a minute, adding some bitter citrus to the mix. The spices creep their way in, creating a warm and spicy aroma. Later, on the dry down, you are able to smell some leather. It remains spicy, though I was still thinking about the opening. In my opinion, it wasn’t very reminiscent of Egypt. It felt pretty standard, apart from the opening. Projection is not crazy, and the longevity is solid. **(4/10)**

**Floraīku**

*The Moon and I:* The mate in the opening is clear, and the slight sweetness of tea is a wonderful support. The botanical, herbal aroma of this fragrance is realistic without being too pungent or bitter, which can be the case from some tea-inspired scents. The cedar works its way in nicely, and grounds the fragrance with its woodiness. If someone passed me on the street, after about five minutes, I could see this fragrance being received as basil, however that subsides after about twenty minutes. It gets softer and sweeter at that time, though still very herbal and slightly woody. Sadly, the longevity is poor, though the projection was favorably un-beastly. **(5/10)**",1,1736372297.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False

The first thing I did when I finished reading the translation was gulp down an entire litre of water. My throat had become parched due to my mouth hanging agape the entire time.

What I had just read shared more in common to the Historical Fiction stories I had written, rather than History. Minus the supernatural element of course. That was by far the most unsettling bit about it, and I couldn’t stop the automatic questions that began to spawn in my head as a result.

*What if inside WAS haunted by spirits?*

*What if Herod WAS buried within?*

*What if all that Salome had witnessed WAS in fact the TRUTH?*

History is filled with references to the supernatural; spells, curses, prayers and incantations that could be found in many different places, tombs being the most common. Crypts of Egyptian Pharaohs have been unearthed, graves and catacombs across Europe scraped clean of treasures specifically given to the dead. Yet, in all of these situations, any references to curses upon the living are never taken seriously. And why should they? Thousands of tombs have been raided and none have ever recorded being haunted after. It was all just the plain old superstitions of a far less educated people from a different time period.

But, the inscription within the *Hamsa* hands on the wall, seemed different. I felt it with every educated strand in my mind.

No one had ever put in as much effort as Salome had to conceal a supposedly dangerous place. If the elaborate patterns and extremely long text on the wall were not a job enough to conduct, then the construction of this secondary seal and the subsequent burial of it all that she mentioned at the end of her text gave enough indication that her intentions went far beyond the cliche of her time.

In my analytical mind, I knew it was just an extremely elaborate example of the fear of the supernatural that was common in ancient times. But the nauseating feeling in my guts, and the throbbing in my chest were only present because I was not wholly content. Something was off about this place.

I slept very little that night, my mind constantly recounting pivotal moments within the text that just so happened to be the most chilling. After all the research I had conducted on Salome, not once was there ever a mention of her connection to key biblical events, and particularly to Heralds of God. She was just a Herodian princess tied to the intrigues of Herod’s court. By the time sleep did come, I was under the conclusion that the inscription had not been translated properly. It was the only logical explanation.

When morning came, I was very eager to meet with Naeem and Mia and hear their opinions of it. It was just before sunrise when I knocked on the door of Naeem’s accommodation.

“This better not be some sick joke,” I said as soon as he answered.

His eyes darted about as he scanned the base behind me for anyone who might have followed me. He jerked his head in a gesture for me to enter, and stood by the door as I brushed past him. He threw the door shut, but withdrew at the last moment to ensure a smooth and gentle latching.

He turned to me, his eyes a mix of hope and eagerness. “You’ve read it all?”

I scoffed. “Nah, I just went to sleep without reading the very text at the centre of the lie that brought me to this place. Now you be transparent with me, Naeem. This is no joke?”

Naeem’s eyes widened and he shook his head vigorously. “Denial is a dangerous emotion when it comes to confronting that which is out of the ordinary. Please, Corey, you know I didn’t drag you here to the West Bank whilst my grandchildren were held hostage just to play some elaborate prank on your educated ego. What you read has been translated almost word for word. The only parts I may have added in were some definite articles for grammar’s sake, but that’s it!”

I sighed, rubbing my poorly rested face with my hand as I collapsed onto a recliner lounge that was beckoning me. “I’m sorry, Naeem. I believe you. It’s just so difficult to comprehend.”

Naeem flicked on the kettle and sat beside me as it began to boil. “Trust me, I had the same reaction as yourself. Mia too. Just be thankful you got to read it all in one sitting. We had to read it at the agonizing pace of the excavation. We would reach a certain point and be desperate to know what happened next but had to wait another week or two until the layer of text below was unearthed.”

“Do you believe it is true?” I asked.

Naeem hesitated for a moment. “Well, I hope not, considering the reasoning behind it all. But you’re the Salome expert, so I was hoping to hear your perspective on such a recount being consistent with her character. Thats the first step before we can go any further with this.”

The kettle reached its boil and as Naeem poured me a cup of coffee, I told him that I did believe it was Salome who had written it. It had been a rather personal retelling of her experiences, nothing like all the source material available that I used for my paper on her. There were references to several historical events, and being told through her POV, I supposed that they did line up as close to what she would have likely experienced.

“What worries me more,” I continued, as Naeem handed me the warm mug of coffee, “is the historical events that are mentioned are quite inconsistent with what has already been recorded.”

Naeem shrugged as he sipped from his cup. “She makes a point of mentioning Nicholas of Damascus, the court historian. He was present for many of that which he recorded, but what if he was only able to record certain events purely out of reliance of someone else’s word for it? Take Antipater’s death for instance. Josephus and Nicholas have recorded him being taken to Caesarea and imprisoned for some time before being executed. What if, Salome’s account is the truth and this was merely the fabrication she told the court when she arrived after witnessing the grizzly end of the prince. We have no other sources to go off, so I’d give that a fair chance.”

I shuddered as I recalled the imagery of Antipater being turned into a bloody dough. It prompted the barrage of questions of the true troubling aspects of the text to come forth.

“Alright, forget historical authenticity. Let’s talk about the…supernatural…things,” I said.

Naeem gulped. “Straight to the crunch then. Good. Well, it sure gives me goosebumps to think that King Herod may very much still be alive, albeit in a tormented state, right beneath our feet.”

“There’s that. But what about this whole bitterness of the Spirits of the children of Bethlehem within? So dangerous they are that a Herald of God was forced to intervene and order the very erection of the wall?”

Naeem nodded. “It definitely doesn’t make me want to go further with the project, wouldn’t you agree?”

I did.

As I said, despite many ancient tombs having some eerie warnings or curses upon them, the effort that went into keeping this place closed off really made me uncomfortable. I believed it was well to respect Salome’s wishes and leave the place alone.

Mia entered, and after catching up to where me and Naeem were at, she sat next to me on the recliner, close enough that our thighs were touching. I felt a moments distraction from the topic of conversation.

“In the end, it is only the three of us here who know that there is actually more to this site than the monolith which has already been uncovered,” Naeem said. “All we have to do, is misinform Suffian that the monolith is nothing more than an inscription detailing the life of Salome. We can use your expertise, Corey, on her character, to fabricate such a text.”

I chuckled bitterly, even though I was sort of in agreement with Naeem. “So here is the crux of me being here then. You are too afraid to enter the tomb, so wish to alter the truth of the text to give Suffian no need to go further. You needed an expert on Salome who can write up the most accurate one imaginable.”

Naeem was silent as he chewed on his gums.

Mia placed a tender hand on my arm and gave me a reassuring smile. “I’ve tried telling him it won’t work. Suffian is a tyrant when it comes to getting this place unearthed, and I fear that his measures will become even more drastic when he learns that the place is not the tomb of Herod that he thought it was.”

Naeem stood up with an exasperated look on his face. “Mia, Salome has made her warning clear enough, and it is up to us to decide if it should be respected or ignored.” He ran a finger along the edge of a steel ring planted on his index finger. It had an Islamic verse written upon it. “I may be an academic, but I am a devout Muslim, which makes me understand one thing. If Allah Wills this place to be sealed, then it is my duty to make sure it remain so.”

I couldn’t argue against that. I was no Muslim, and definitely not the devout Catholic that my parents would have wanted. But in the end, if, just IF, Salome was telling the truth of there being bitter spirits within the tomb, I would much prefer to leave it alone.

And so, for the next three days as we awaited Suffian’s return, I worked closely with Naeem and Mia, editing the translation to such an extreme that by the time we reached the finished product the only original part was the scene of Salome helping Joseph escape Bethlehem with the help of her lover, David. The rest was, in the end, a very well researched biography told in the first person.

My nervous anticipation of confronting Suffian for the first time was temporarily put at ease by my evening flings in Mia’s apartment. When we weren’t working on our presentation for Suffian - a rarity - we fucked. I’ve had many flings with women over the years, but the sex with Mia definitely came with a measure of passion. When we had finished, we would lie in each other’s arms, and, despite the more demanding tasks at hand, talked about our lives. The sex was amazing, but it was these conversations that I looked forward to the most. With the few opportunities we had, I managed to learn so much about her. I knew I was falling in love with this girl of simple origins who had defied her family’s expectations to become the educated woman she was today. Her love was vigorously returned.

When Suffian arrived at the site, he did so with all the pomp that I had been expecting. The entire team stationed at the site, from labourers, Archaeologists, us three Historians, cooks, machinery maintenance crew, and security personnel, lined the cleared section of the plateau that served as the carpark, as a convoy of military grade vehicles pooled into the site. Dust filled the air and choked our lungs as we stood there as though we were waiting for the Queen. All up, twenty vehicles had entered. Hamza stepped out from the tenth vehicle, a cigarette jutting from his mouth and making no effort in concealing the two pistols holstered beneath his bullet proof vest. He made his way to the passenger door and opened it.

Out came a tall man wearing a plain blue button up shirt. His full head of thick white hair was cropped short, a stark comparison to his dark bushy eyebrows and moustache. His face seemed inclined to a perpetual scowl. He gave me the instant impression of someone who always got his way and would refuse to compromise for anything. He had the look of one not unused to ordering death.

He scanned the gathered people and when his eyes fell upon Naeem’s - a gesture that made the professor quake - he approached us, Hamza and his security team following close behind.

“Suffian, it is good to see you,” Naeem said in a supplicating tone. He looked exactly like how I imagined a slave addressing their master in ancient times.

Without even an acknowledgment of the greeting, Suffian bore his hard gaze onto me. “You are the scholar from Italy?” he asked in heavily accented English.

“Yes.”

For what felt like an eternity, I was imprisoned by his scowling face as his eyes seemed to reach into my very soul to analyse my character. I wouldn’t have been surprised if he pulled out a knife and began to saw at my throat.

“Good. Tell me what is written on that wall,” Suffian said, straight to the point.

Naeem shuffled forward. “Suffian, come to my accommodation, it’ll be easier to discuss it-“

“You’ve had enough time. I want answers. Now!” Suffian spat. Hamza rested his hand upon the holster of his gun, adding further emphasis to Suffian’s demand.

Suffian’s eyes continued to bear down on me as I struggled to find the words as to how I was going to address the situation. I was for the life of me not expecting to be thrown straight into the deep end like this. Logic had compelled me to believe that after greeting us, Suffian would have retired with the three of us to the comfort and quiet of one of the accommodations. There we could have had him read our fabricated translation before addressing him as we had already rehearsed. This had just thrown all planning right out the window. We didn’t even have the fabricated translation on us to refer to.

In that moment I was about to give in. I was about to tell the lie we had agreed on. Threat from this demanding politician or not, I was not going to allow him to violate Salome’s warning and unleash a potential evil upon the Earth.

But just as I was about to speak, Mia stepped forward.

“There’s more to the site! What has been uncovered is only a secondary seal for the true seal of the tomb. You can go further!”

Both me and Naeem glared at Mia with wide eyes. I was horrified that she would tell the truth so easily. All the last days hard work of fabricating the story to conceal the truth had been for nothing.

Suffian’s eyebrows raised in response to the remark, but he kept his gaze locked on me.  “Do not speak out of turn, Woman, I want to hear what this foreigner has to say about it.”

If the setting had been somewhere a lot more casual, I would have broken the nose on that scowling face as compensation for his rude remark.

Seeing no other way out of this, I did what Naeem didn’t want. I told Suffian a summary of the true translation. All the while, I could see Naeem’s head lowered and tears wetting the dust at his feet. At one point, Mia placed a hand on his shoulder, only for him to pull away aggressively. Suffian noticed the gesture.

Suffian nodded his head when I finished, “Good.”

There was a drawn-out silence as I awaited some comment from the politician about the supernatural events within the text.

Suffian turned to the group of archaeologists standing next to us and addressed their team leader, Milad. “We will recommence the excavations today. I want that marble slab broken through by whatever means necessary.”

I was aghast. It was as though Suffian had been deaf to the entire warning that had been the purpose of the text.

Milad inclined his head, “Sir, shall we not try to preserve the entire slab? Itself is an artefact worthy of care.”

“Did you take plenty of photos of it?” Suffian said.

“Well, yes. But-

“Thats good enough. We have the translated text and visual reference. We do not need to keep it. What lies behind it is a treasure far more worthy of retaining.”

Now Naeem stepped forward, gone was his miserable and subservient composure. He stood before Suffian, head held high in defiance, his features twisted in disgust. “Will you not heed the warning?” he snapped.

Suffian sneered at the professor, and for the first time, chuckled. “What warning? All I hear is Christian garbage. As a Muslim, I do not believe that Jesus the Prophet was divine, therefore any reference to the Christian story of his birth is irrelevant to me.”

“But what if it is?” Naeem pleaded. “Allah willed the secondary seal according to the text. We can’t just ignore it!”

Suffian hawked and spat a large gobbet of phlegm at Naeem’s feet. “You are a blaspheming infidel to believe Allah had any part in. As I said, it is an offshoot of a key Christian story, therefore it is all a lie.” Suffian turned and addressed the gathered staff. “The excavations will recommence. Palestine will have claim to the true final resting place of King Herod.” He clapped his hands impatiently and gesticulated for everyone to hurry off to commence their work. None disobeyed.

Instead of following the order, Naeem stood there laughing. Suffian turned to him and slapped him hard across the face. It did little to falter his unexpected joviality. He pointed a finger at Suffian as he spoke, “You claim to be a devout Muslim. Look at you! You refuse to believe that the warning was placed by Allah, yet you clearly believe the story enough to have such a strong certainty Herod is in there. Everything you just said, reeks of hypocrisy. You do not respect Allah. You are only compelled by greed which deafens you to His word, only allowing your ears to perceive that which you want to hear.”

In a swift motion, Suffian buried his hand in one of his pants pockets and pulled out a switch blade. Before any of us could react, he lunged at Naeem and stabbed him three times in the throat.

Mia screamed and attempted to run to the professor’s side, but was held back by one of Hamza’s security personnel. Another came to my side, but I was too frozen in shock for him to have to restrain me. I watched with wide eyes as Naeem held his bleeding throat, gasping for breath as blood bubbled around his mouth. He looked at me for a brief moment and moved his mouth where I could just make out the words, “Don’t open it”. He then collapsed face first on the dusty ground and was no more.

“You fucking bastard!” Mia screamed at Suffian, who was crouched beside Naeem indifferently wiping the blood off his blade on his shirt. “He only spoke the truth!”

Suffian stood up and stepped towards her, holding his now cleaned knife to her face. For an agonizing moment, I was certain she would be following Naeem.

“Truth!!” Suffian spat. “I see the truth! That Naeem and you knew all along what was written on that wall. That you only brought this foreigner in, to delay the further excavations!”

I could see Mia about to come up with something, and fear for her wellbeing took a hold of me. “It’s true!” I shouted. “Naeem only brought me here to delay the dig, as you said. But Mia had no part in it! She stressed to the professor that it was folly to do so. But he refused to listen to her. And now look where he ended up. Please, let Mia go!”

Suffian flicked his blood red eyes to me and snickered. “I admire your heroics, foreigner, but don’t think me a fool on how the world works. Your lover here, yes, it’s obvious that she is, is equally as guilty as the professor. Herself being a Christian, and a pretty one at that, I am not surprised that a Muslim like Naeem would turn his back on Allah and believe the lie. Women are excellent at seeping their poison into a respectable man’s mind.”

His eyes fell to her throat, and I knew what his intentions were. In seconds this beautiful, sophisticated woman who had stolen my heart the moment I met her, would be killed. My mind scrambled for a way to save her whilst restrained.

“YOU NEED HER!” I roared. Suffian halted at that. “Now that Naeem is gone, she is the most superior historian tied to this project! Kill her, and you risk the integrity of whatever it is you find in there! Without a Historian, no one will believe the monumental discovery you are so adamant in making.”

Suffian lowered his knife and put it back in his pocket. He released his hold of Mia and she immediately collapsed into my arms, crying hard into my chest. I held her close as I glared at that monster of a man who dared to accuse her of being responsible for her superior’s beliefs.

“You are right, foreigner, thank you for staying my hand before impulse took it. I will spare her. But neither of you will have a part in this project until you are needed. I will not allow two Christians who had worked with one that was willing to delay the dig out of fear for a lie, to roam about and sow their ideas into good Muslims. Naeem has already cost me enough time, so you lot will not be given the chance to do the same.”

And so it was that Mia and I were imprisoned within Naeem’s accommodations. Suffian ordered Hamza to station security personnel at every window and door. For the first few minutes of this imprisonment we sat on the sofa as I held her trembling form close to me as she wept for Naeem. We were soon interrupted when Suffian barged through the door holding my laptop, opened up with its screen displaying the beginning of a Word document. It was the fabricated story we had intended to tell him. I sighed, knowing there was little I could do to get out of this situation. The paranoid fuck had wasted no time searching through “the foreigners” belongings.

I was roughly torn away from Mia who cried after me, and dragged by two security personnel to my accommodation. I was given another lecture by Suffian on his mistrust of Mia and I, followed by the flexing of his good faith to Allah. I received several punches and kicks by Hamza to drive home the point. They seized my laptop, phone and any other device they deemed I could use to communicate with the outside world, before I was finally left alone. Suffian made some small adjustments to our imprisonment, and a second team of personnel were needed to guard my accommodations. Mia and I were to remain separated for the duration of incarceration.

Little happened for the next month. When I wasn’t worrying about Mia’s wellbeing, I spent most of my solitude in reflection on the text. I was fortunate enough to still have the original translation folder, so I re read it a number of times. With each reading I became evermore certain that Salome was telling the truth and that God truly did send his Herald down to prompt her to ensure the tomb remained sealed forever.

I reflected on one of the chilling lines towards the end of the text: *There is no knowing what position God will be in to counter them.*

What could possibly tie up the supposed omniscient creator of everything so much that he couldn’t send down a single Herald to shun the Spirits again? It was infuriating that the Herald had mentioned the nature of the Spirits bitterness, but nothing on ways they could be countered without God’s intervention. It only stressed the doom and gloom that awaited those that decided to open it up. A.K.A, us.

I was no expert on the supernatural, or even God for that matter, but I was certain there would be a means for us mortals to counter them. It just needed to be discovered first.

Despite their orders, most of the security personnel were actually quite easy going, and allowed for Mia and I to exchange hand written notes. She had been the first to send one, and it was such a relief when I read it and learned she was unharmed. My heart swelled with the knowledge that she had been the one to take the initiative to ask the guard to allow the exchange. The thought had not once crossed my mind.

I replied with an update on my own wellbeing, followed by a bit of a chiding for her initial interruption when I was about to tell Suffian the fabricated story we had been working on. I stressed that I loved her, but was certain that if she had not done what she did, perhaps Naeem may still be alive. It wasn’t till the next day when I received her answer:

*“Delusion drove Naeem during those last days of his life. If we revealed the fabricated account, it would have changed nothing. Suffian would not have been happy with that and we would have been searched soon after. They would have found the true translation, and you can imagine what would have happened to all of us as a result.*

*Though, I say all this now, but at the time that was far from what compelled me to intervene. I did it for you, Corey. Words cannot describe how much I love you, and the thought of you lying and compromising your very life, tore my heart in two. I will do anything for you. If there is a pathway that would see us both out of this place, spared from both Suffian, and the coming potential wrath of the Spirits, know that I have every intention of spending the rest of my life with you. That is, if you’d be happy to?”*

Fuck yes, I was.

Finally, forty days later, the door to my accommodation swung open, and Suffian entered. He was accompanied by Hamza, Milad and to my upmost joy, Mia. Her beautiful smile made my heart melt.

 I was about to charge towards her and bury her in my arms when Hamza stepped forward and pushed me back.

“This is a professional meeting, foreigner, not a reunion party,” Suffian said in a condescending manner. “Keep your emotions towards the woman restrained, for we have come after achieving a major milestone in the excavations of the tomb and will be needing to recommence your services very soon.”

I looked at Mia, eyes wide at this new development but she merely shrugged.

My chest began to tighten as I asked Suffian, “Has the tomb been unearthed?”

Suffian gestured for Milad to fill me in.

“Nearly. After breaking through the marble slab, we reached the original seal.” Milad said this with clear reluctance. I knew Milad would be crying inside for having been ordered to destroy the beautiful hand marked wall. It was simply a violation to his very responsibility as an Archaeologist, that being to preserve. “The first drill has finally entered the void behind the original seal, having bored for about half a meter. There is more drilling taking place as we speak. They should have the integrity of the rock compromised enough to be broken down and removed for a human to enter. I believe this can be achieved within the week.”

So now the fun begins, I thought.

“You and Mia are to be present when we enter the tomb for the first time,” Suffian said, before turning to Hamza and chuckling. “If there are Spirits in there at least they’ll get to meet two who believed in their existence.”

I shuddered at the thought.

That was literally all that Suffian had to tell me, and left with a spring in his step. In a way I hoped that the Spirits existed and meant to bring us harm. At least they could unleash their wrath on that arrogant man.

Milad and Mia remained and we continued to be filled in by the head Archaeologist on some of the finds they had already made. Hamza watched over us, but allowed Mia to be next to me, where we held hands tightly as we listened to Milad.

What was at first thought to be some discolouration on the surface of the original seal, turned out to be ancient dried up blood. It was predominantly smeared about on one side of the stone, and upon closer examination, contained multiple fingerprints. It was evident that there were at least nineteen individuals who had been present, touching the stone for whatever reason, with either bleeding, or bloody hands.

I recalled from the text that the tomb had been opened twice, maybe three times. The first being to place the bodies of the children and the Thugs within, the second when all the events towards the end of the text took place.

“Did you read the translation?” I asked Milad.

He sighed. “I have,” he then lowered his voice so that it was little more than a whisper, “And yes, I do believe what it says, even though nothing unnatural has happened since the drill pierced into it.”

“Yet,” I said.

He nodded reluctantly. “May Allah forgive me for defying Him.”

“Would you say these bloody hand prints line up with the text?”

Mia spoke up. “Well, isn’t it obvious! The fingerprints are situated predominantly on one side of the large stone. Most likely candidate? The men who had killed the children and rolled the stone in place the first time.”

“Or the soldiers who slew the thugs,” I added. “They somehow seem to be forgotten.”

Milad’s face turned pale. “I think there is a reason they were forgotten. Because they were not the ones who killed the thugs. The blood came from the thugs hands as they opened the tomb to place the bodies within… but I don’t think they ever saw the light of day after that.”

“So, what are you saying? Herod and Antipater alone killed them?”

Milad whispered again. “The children did.”

I felt my chest tighten and a chill run down my spine. It was an absurd notion, but somehow, I knew it to be the truth. Mia’s grip on my hand tightened further.

Hamza was momentarily distracted by one of his subordinates. I jumped at the brief window of opportunity. “Listen,” I whispered urgently, “there must be a way we can counter these Spirits if God is not able to intervene.”

“Intervene!” Milad said, aghast, “Corey, we are disobeying Allah, which means His back will be turned on us. If there is to be any sort of counter, then let it be Allah’s forgiveness. Though, at this point, I fear not even grovelling in Mecca will get His attention.”

In the end, I knew Milad spoke true. We were the ones not heeding the warning; therefore, we were destined to suffer for our ignorance.

Hamza came back and ordered Mia and Milad to accompany him back out. Before she could leave my side, I kissed her passionately on the lips, knowing it would be the last time we could do so before entering the tomb. There was a high chance it was our last kiss.

As I hugged her, I whispered into her ear. “When we enter it, no matter what happens, stay by my side. Fuck, Suffian. If the Spirits are to torment us, then together we will endure it.”

She pulled away, smiling through her glassy eyes, “makes a great synopsis for a tragic romance. Two star crossed lovers, forced to enter a cursed tomb against their will, refusing to leave each-others side as they are tormented by evil spirits for eternity.”

I wish I could disagree with her, but knew I’d only be lying.

Hamza pulled her away, and once again I was left alone.

For the next four days I felt like an inmate on death row as I awaited the call to enter the tomb that none of us were meant to.",4,1736372249.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

It's supposed to go in effect on Dec 30, 2024 but has been extended for 12 months. 

The EU's new Deforestation Regulation requires companies trading in cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soya and wood, as well as products derived from these commodities, to conduct extensive diligence on the value chain to ensure the goods do not result from recent (post 31 December 2020) deforestation, forest degradation or breaches of local environmental and social laws. 

AFAIK, the only cash crop in kerala that qualifies for EUDR is coffee which has actually raised demand for crops grown in the state. What about rest of the cash crops like rubber, cocoa?

1hwvfvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1hwvfvj/my_boomer_mother_and_the_samsung_s24/,My Boomer Mother and the Samsung S24.,"I have a phone with a poopy camera. It's not terrible(S20 FE 5G) but certainly nothing to compare with a 2024 model. 

My Boomer Mother came into some $ and wanted to give the grandkids 1k each for Xmas. My youngest son put his towards a new PC. My oldest got a new phone at the mall. My neice got cash. My nephew wanted to spend his $ on a new phone as well, which grandma bought on Amazon for him. 

When the Amazon box came, we waited for my nephew to be there to unbox it. Xmas came, he opens the box and, wouldn't you know it, there was 2 inside. 

My sister laughed and asked if anyone else needed a new phone and I said mine could certainly use an upgrade, but that there was likely someone else who needed it more than me, (as i didnt want to accept a xmas gift without being able to reciprocate.) 

Now, please keep in mind that we had already agreed that the adults were not exchanging gifts at xmas 2024 as it's been an extremely tight and difficult year for many. (I had already bought gifts for her when we came to that decision, so I gifted her those couple little things in late Oct. and said at that time, since we arent exchanging gifts this year, I might as well let you use it now. It was a rice washer and a martini-glass-style glass incense burner. I then stopped shopping for her.)

Anyways, back from that tangent. We then encouraged her to use the android phone herself or possibly return it. She didnt say anything and frowned a lot. 

My sister and I both then encouraged her to look at her online receipts and see if she had been charged for 2 phones. She seemed reluctant. We drop the topic like it's hot and continue with Xmas dinner.

A week after xmas I saw the phone still on the counter, so I asked if she had found out why she had received 2 phones. Turns out she accidentally ordered 2 and she was furious she didn't realize. She said she was now asking friends if anyone needed a new phone and her friends said they were ok, and that they didnt need it. I told her that, like I'd said earlier, I could definitely use an upgrade and would be happy to help beyond my normal cleaning and cooking to work off the cost. She literally winced, and said she would ask more people if they wanted it first. I mentally wrote it off as not my business and carried on with life.

Skipping forward to today, Jan.8, I am sitting in my downstairs suite and clearly hear My Boomer Mother talking on the phone to my deceased dad's best friend (he likes to check in on her since my dad died in June.) When asked how her xmas went, the first thing she says is that she didn't receive a single gift. Not in a stoic or honorable way, not even in a laugh it off or funny way, but said like a pouting brat with not enough gifts under the tree. (She is a known malicious gossip-monger, and will tell complete BS and outright lies to extended family and friends about how awful the world in general and me and my kids in particular are to her and how much everyone owes her. I've had to let her run a smear campaign against me while at the same time I wash her dishes, her clothes, cook her meals, etc. She is unable to care for herself or my grandma that lives with her upstairs, so I take care of them. 

I figured it was a good time to go on upstairs and get a cup of coffee as we share a kitchen. I said ""Didnt you tell us not to get you anything this year?"" 

""Oh yea, I did say that."" She says and then hurriedly tells dad's friend that she told us not to give her anything this year, and then she quickly changed the subject. She also asks him if he or his wife want the accidently ordered phone and he predictably said no thanks. 

Afterwards she hung up the phone with Dad's bestie and was behaving oddly. More aggitated than angry maybe? She said something about not knowing anyone who needs the phone and not sure what to do with it. Then, out of nowhere she says ""i'd give it to you if i knew you needed a new phone."" I said, nope. I didnt need it because i was going to upgrade to the same phone via my provider's current offer. She asked if I wanted the phone. I said I could use it, but was already planning to get the same one in a couple weeks so if she wanted to send it back i'd not care a tick, and left it at that. 

She then went to her bedroom and found it and put it down infront of me on the counter and then went to her ophthalmology appt.

I'm now not sure what to do. Owing her is never a good plan in my experience. Also, Is this bribery? Does it seem like she is trying to help me ""forget"" what I overheard in exchange for a new phone? Kinda feels like it. I left it in the box, not sure I want it.

During xmas we picked out a house in Canada and we are in the process of getting a mortgage, etc.

I'm looking into the price of shipping or household items to Canada but I think the price will be beyond our budget. Still waiting for a few shipping companies to give me a quote, but the quote I've gotten are far too expensive. 

The house we are buying is unfurnished. Someone in Canada offered to sell a lot of furniture to me for $1000. Tv, tv stand, a couple small sofas, a bed that is almost new (it was in the guest room), 2 dining sets with chairs, coffee table, end table, 2 cabinets, old computer desk, a few small side tables, and a fridge (newer than the fridge in the house we will buy). Everything looks to be in great condition.

I was very excited about this opportunity.

I sent the pictures to my partner. 

Through a text chat, she said she only liked one thing. I said then I will buy it and try to sell the items. I believe it is worth much more than $1000.

She said this should be a joint decision because we should both feel well in the house. She said by me saying I would buy it and still things, that I am not giving her a say. By the time I got home about an hour later, she was upset. Then I got upset and felt very deflated.

I think we should buy everything and use the furniture in the beginning because we are not rich and it would be better than moving into an empty house. Or, if she really doesn't want it in the house, I put it in the garage (not connected to the house) and try to sell the items individually to make a profit. Based on the local prices on FB marketplace, I'm confident I could at least double the money I paid.

She feels I am rushing to buy these things and I should be patient, but more importantly, make this decision together.

1hwvckq,https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/1hwvckq/after_1000_drops_here_is_the_percentage_of_all/,"After 1000 drops, here is the percentage of all Jelly Chia items on hard difficulty (including the Jelly World Stamp)","Hello, this is the conclusion of a previous thread that discussed the probability of getting the Jelly World Stamp (JWS), which was done with a total of 500 drops. Here is the definitive version of the percentage of all items that Jelly Chia can drop, with better accuracy, done on hard difficulty.

First of all, why do these statistics with Jelly Chia? What does it have to offer?  
  
Well, our blue jelly friend has 6 specific drops, 3 of which have good market value (disregarding market fluctuations). They are:  
  
Jelly Mysteries (10k);  
  
Jelly Pop Stamp (55k);  
  
Jelly World Stamp (360k);

This would make Jelly Chia one of the most profitable opponents in the Battledome, however the drop rate of these items was not determined (until now), leaving it unclear whether it was worth battling him.

Motivated by simple curiosity ~~and frustration~~, I decided to calculate the drop percentage of these items, in addition to the other non-exclusive items.

[Drop percentage by category](https://preview.redd.it/29kodl5cxtbe1.png?width=367&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cdfac25be96e9542c1ac147667564b0753128b7)

[Percentage of exclusive Jelly Chia drops](https://preview.redd.it/q1mcf38pytbe1.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=56a43045c6806162a4d101fce5b1e04267440293)

The results are available in the images, but in short and simple terms, we can conclude:  
At the end of the battle, for each item dropped by our jelly friend, you have a 4.3% chance of obtaining an exclusive item from him. The Jelly World Stamp have a chance of 0.4%, which gives around 1 JWS for every 250 drops (about 17 days of consecutive battles).  
  
More than 50% of the drops are haunted foods, while mystical stones are 28.8% (counting basic and red). Finally, the number of fairy bottles was 14.7%. The percentage of each of these items is below.

[Percentage of all items dropped by Jelly Chia](https://preview.redd.it/h94ds82o0ube1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe26c3a69abf83b1cd0898d2b5463bae8dd5e93d)

Now, after the hardest part is completed, what can we conclude? Well, the JWS does have a very low drop rate, however, because it is a stamp, its value tends to fluctuate constantly. For example, 5 months ago, the value of the JWS was around 640k. Therefore, it is an item with great potential.  
  
If we take into account the other stamp, Jelly Pop Stamp, and Jelly Mysteries (a book, which also tend to fluctuate), with these 3 items alone, you will have made a profit of 1.6m in sales (considering the current value of these items), in around 2 months.

\*BUT IF I WANT TO FIGHT HIM, HOW STRONG SHOULD MY PET BE???  
  
Jelly Chia has 225 HP, so I would recommend that your pet be at least level 50 (due to the Lens Flare skill) and 125 attack (3x multiplier), and have at least 2 weapons that equal or exceed 16 icons. With these stats, 2 or 3 rounds are enough. If you have a Freezer (Thunder Sticks or H4000 Helmet), it will be much easier.  
  
Well, I believe that I have covered everything about this opponent. The intention from now on is to do these statistics with other opponents. The next ones on the list will be:  
The Snowager = Frozen Negg, 370k (easy difficulty);  
Harry the Mutant Moehog = Moehog Transmogrification Potion, 295k (hard difficulty);  
Lava Ghoul = Lava Monster Stamp, 320k (hard difficulty).

However, when I was took my lunchbox out this morning to put it in the communal fridge, the calendar was on top of my lunchbox it in my backpack pocket so I took it out and I accidentally left it on the kitchen table. When I went down for lunch today I saw the calendar on the table, but someone ripped all of the days up to today out of it and threw the pages in the trash where they got stained with coffee. 

Why would you touch or rip a calendar that is not yours and has not yet been opened let alone ripped.

Cover and everything were still on it when I left it! The cover and multiple pages that I had not even read yet just discarded and stained. I was planning on not ripping out any pages and just folding them back so I could always go back and flip through them again.

over winter break, i requested to follow him back on instagram and within twelve hours he accepted and requested to follow me back. the class we were in simulated us govt and i was one of his party leaders - we were both assigned as republicans so we worked on some legislation together. we made good small talk and had a good rapport but the simulation was hectic and i was also crushing on another guy at the time (and i'm not the type to keep a rotating roster, i'd rather just crush on one person at once) so he wasn't immediately on my radar. i'm very much a girls' girl which is why i was disappointed when i found out that the other dude had a girlfriend. the other dude gave me a lot of signals and i didn't see a girl on his instagram which is why i was so surprised but i immediately backed down.

this guy that i want to ask out doesn't have a visible girlfriend either - just photos with guys from his frat - which is a green flag to me because as a former girlscout, connecting with and making same-sex friends and having those spaces is super important.

so i guess my question is: **what would you think if a girl from a class you were in dmed you on instagram to ask you out for coffee or a walk in the park? would you want to date her?**

Tips and Tricks for Creating a Cozy and Functional Home Kitchen Environment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a cozy and functional home kitchen environment is essential for any cook, whether you’re whipping up a quick breakfast or preparing a feast for family and friends. A kitchen should not only be a place for food preparation but also a welcoming area that inspires creativity and joy in cooking. Here are some practical tips and tricks to help you transform your kitchen into a warm and efficient space.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/elises-home-kitchen  
  
### Embrace Open Spaces

An open kitchen layout can significantly enhance the feeling of coziness. Consider removing unnecessary barriers around your kitchen. Here are some ideas:

- Opt for open shelving instead of upper cabinets. This not only adds a spacious feel but also allows you to showcase your favorite dishes and cookbooks.
- Install a kitchen island. An island offers extra prep space and creates a central spot for casual dining and gatherings.
- Use light colors for walls and cabinets to make your kitchen appear larger and more inviting.

### Incorporate Natural Elements

Bringing in natural elements can create an inviting atmosphere. Here’s how you can do this:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/elises-home-kitchen  
  
- Add plants. Herbs like basil and thyme thrive indoors and are handy for cooking.
- Utilize natural materials for countertops and flooring, such as wood and stone, to connect your kitchen with nature.
- Install large windows or glass doors to let in natural light. A sunlit kitchen feels warm and welcoming.

### Optimize Your Layout

A well-thought-out kitchen layout can enhance functionality. Consider these tips:

- Arranging your kitchen in a triangular layout—placing the stove, sink, and refrigerator in a triangular format—helps improve workflow and efficiency.
- Keep frequently used items within arm’s reach. Store pots, pans, and utensils in drawers near the stove to make cooking easier.
- Consider a pull-out pantry. It provides extra storage and keeps essential items organized.

### Add Personal Touches

Your kitchen should reflect your personality. Here are some ways to personalize the space:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/elises-home-kitchen  
  
- Display family photos or art on the walls. These personal touches add warmth and make the kitchen feel like home.
- Choose decorative kitchen items that match your style, from dish towels to cutting boards.
- Incorporate a chalkboard wall to jot down recipes, grocery lists, or reminders. It adds a fun and functional element.

### Create a Cozy Lighting Scheme

Good lighting can significantly impact the ambiance of your kitchen. Try these tips to improve lighting:

- Layer your lighting. Use a combination of ambient, task, and accent lighting to create a warm and inviting feel.
- Consider pendant lights over your kitchen island for both functional and decorative purposes.
- Use warm-toned bulbs to create a comforting glow, especially in the evenings.

### Maintain Organization

A clutter-free kitchen is more inviting and functional. Here are some organization hacks:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/elises-home-kitchen  
  
- Use clear containers for pantry items. This not only keeps ingredients fresh but also makes it easy to find what you need.
- Label everything. Whether it’s jars or shelves, organization helps you know where everything is, reducing stress during cooking.
- Have a designated spot for everything. Ensure that each tool and ingredient has a home to keep the kitchen tidy.

### Invest in Quality Tools

Good tools can elevate your cooking experience and, in turn, your enjoyment of the kitchen. Here’s what to consider:

- Invest in high-quality kitchen knives for efficient food prep.
- Choose durable cookware that retains heat well, making it easier to cook.
- Opt for multi-functional appliances that save space and provide versatility. For example, a coffee maker that can brew and also serve as a kettle.

By following these tips, you can create a cozy and functional home kitchen that inspires delicious meals and happy moments. A well-designed space not only enhances your cooking experience but also turns your kitchen into a favored gathering place for friends and family.

### Conclusion

Elise's home kitchen embodies more than just a space for cooking; it reflects the heart and soul of culinary creativity. This environment can inspire anyone to transform their own cooking experience, encouraging experimentation and fostering a nurturing atmosphere. The essence of Elise's kitchen lies in its warmth, where every pot and pan tells a story and each meal shared turns into a cherished memory.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/elises-home-kitchen  
  
Creating a cozy and functional home kitchen is easier than you might think. By incorporating thoughtful organization, choosing the right colors and materials, and investing in tools that resonate with you, you can design a space that invites you to cook with passion. Small touches, like adding personal mementos or plants, can elevate your kitchen's ambiance, making it a welcoming hub for family and friends.

When you focus on these tips and tricks, you not only enhance the practicality of your kitchen but also cultivate an environment that feels uniquely yours. Remember, it's not just about the culinary outcome; it's about enjoying the journey of cooking. Whether you’re preparing a simple weekday meal or hosting a gathering, your home kitchen should bring joy and inspiration to you and those you share it with. Embrace the essence of Elise's home kitchen, and let it be the foundation for countless delicious adventures in your culinary journey.

It was my first payout from launching a SaaS project, an ad-based platform born from late-night coding sessions and spare-time content creation. I wasn't chasing millions, but this paltry sum was both a punchline and a heartbreak. It was the tangible result of my sweat, my dreams, and my relentless drive to make something meaningful. Yet, it was laughably insufficient to cover even a coffee.

The journey was grueling. By day, I was the diligent employee, by night, a solitary entrepreneur juggling roles from developer to marketer to customer support. Burnout became my shadow, creeping up as I coded until the early hours, only to repeat the cycle. Rejection letters from investors piled up, each one a cold reminder that my idea wasn't scalable. And in the quiet moments, self-doubt whispered that perhaps I was chasing a mirage.

Scrolling through social media, I saw the world celebrating success stories while I was in the trenches, fighting for each user. The loneliness of this path was palpable, a silent battle with skepticism from the outside world.

Then came the epiphany, born from frustration with the impersonal nature of search engines. What if I could craft something more? What if my AI could understand not just queries but the person behind them? From this question, Mees AI was conceived, a project that lit a fire in me like nothing before.

Building Mees AI was like breathing life into a dream. This time, passion was my fuel. I poured everything into making it intuitive, user-centric, engaging with a community online that became my support system. The transition from $0.52 to Mees AI wasn't just about money; it was a saga of transformation, resilience, and the discovery of my true calling. This story, from struggle to growth, is what makes Mees AI not just a project, but a testament to a journey that's as much about the heart as it is about innovation. ",1,1736370058.0,SaaS,1,1.0,False

I’m 23, he’s turning 30 this month. Any time I express an opinion he undermines me because “you’re not 25 yet, so you don’t know anything.” He acts like because he’s older than me that he is the pinnacle of maturity yet his whole personality is a contradiction of that, and I’m about to explain why. 

Basically, for the last 3 years he’s been living under my mom’s roof rent-free. He gets drunk, sits in his own filth, and then berates her for the way she cooks dinner or what she spends her money on, or simply breathing the wrong way. He doesn’t look for a job or pay a single bill yet thinks he’s entitled to everything. She has asked him to run to the store for him because she’s disabled and can’t run errands herself, and his response is to manipulate her into paying him to do it so he can buy more beer even though I can’t remember the last time he gave her a penny to help with the bills. Matter of fact, she pays his phone bill and his Xbox and he only eats because of her. He leaves beer cans, food, cigarette ashes etc everywhere but if you so much as leave a coffee cup out he will scream at you over it. We had an incident a few months ago where I cooked a big dinner and then wanted to relax for a while before tending to the dishes because quite frankly I stayed up all night cooking for them & was tired. 

The second I sat down he barged in the room screaming at me and ended up punching me in the head. Last night I went over there to visit my mom and stay over (horrible decision making on my part) and I got a total of two hours of sleep because he found a reason to scream at my mom from in the afternoon yesterday until this afternoon. I keep telling her that she’s enabling this behavior by letting him stay there, but she says he threatens her every time she tries to kick him out and has stolen money from her. However I think another issue is that she still loves and cares about him and doesn’t want her son on the streets. I just don’t know what to do because I feel like I can’t even go visit my own mom in peace anymore.

I need to vent, and hopefully, this gets me some advice, visibility, or maybe just a virtual pat on the back.

I bought a Terra Kaffe machine because I’m an amateur barista who loves tech. My espresso machine at home is a Decent Espresso, but I needed a super-automatic for my office to grab a quick coffee between meetings. Naturally, I wanted something just as cool as the Decent.

Well, plot twist: my machine stopped working, contacted support, no resolution, shipped my machine. Silence. It’s been three months, and I still don’t have a machine. Buckle up, here’s the saga:

The Issue:

* Extended Delay: My machine’s been out for repair/replacement for over three months. Updates? Rare. Timelines? A mystery. After a week or so, I need to follow up with them. Wait a couple more days. They make a promise. After a couple more days I realize they are going to break the promise. I am stuck in this endless loop.
* Inadequate Replacement Offer: I was told I’d get a “less used” replacement machine—even though mine is still under warranty. Meanwhile, they’re selling the same model on their website at a $600 discount.
* Poor Communication: Updates happen only when I chase them down like a caffeine-deprived detective.
* Broken Promises: Lots of “I’ll follow up” and “It’ll ship soon,” but still no clear timeline or tracking number. Santa, I've been a good guy all my life. I just want my coffee! Pleaaaaaaaase.

Why I’m Frustrated:

* The lack of proactive communication makes it feel like my issue is at the bottom of someone’s inbox.
* Being without my machine for over three months has made my office coffee setup feel like a sad vending machine corner.

What I’m Asking For:  
All I want is a brand-new replacement unit, shipped immediately, with clear tracking information. Simple, right?

Terra Kaffe built its reputation on customer care and sleek products, but honestly, my experience has been more ""customer don't care"" and ""sleek excuses.""

I even messaged their CEO (Sahand Dilmaghani), CTO (Vito DiMercurio), and CXO (Cate Marques) on LinkedIn. Guess what? Crickets. Either they don’t care, or… no, yeah, they just don’t care.

So, have you had similar experiences with Terra Kaffe or any other brands? How did you handle it? I’d love to hear your thoughts.",1,1736369820.0,TerraKaffe,2,1.0,False

Then texts me later- “I’m a bit lost right now. Meet up or talk soon though”
He called later and vaguely alluded to having overextended himself socially, I think he was having dinner with a friend that night…
Inwardly I was pretty pissed for having wasted my day waiting around for him, but I didn’t say anything. I figured he was trying to get out of it altogether so I let it go, feeling over it. Actions show clearly how much he prioritizes me, and just a lack of common decency 

4 days later, he texts me like ain’t nothing the matter with how he behaved. I know things happen and I forgive easily, but what happened didn’t sit right with me, and I don’t know how to go forward. I want to express my feelings but not in an accusatory or harsh way.

VPNs don't provide perfect protection (you'll have to trust your VPN provider), but they'll always be better than nothing when using a public hotspot. It also makes it easier for you to keep watching your favorite shows even when you're on vacation. If you want to learn more about how to protect yourself online, check out our guide to the best VPNs.

* '2-Year' (click [here](https://www.appreviewhub.co.uk/2024/12/nordvpn-discount-code-save-big-on.html)), 2-year plan, from **$2.99/month**, up to 74% discount + 3 months extra
* '1-Year' (click [here](https://www.appreviewhub.co.uk/2024/12/nordvpn-discount-code-save-big-on.html)), 1-year plan, from **$4.59/month**, up to 67% discount + 3 months extra

**Get 74% off NordVPN subscriptions using our exclusive code**

NordVPN always has great deals, but some are better than others, and this is one of the best we’ve seen. NordVPN is currently offering 74% off its regular price and 3 months free when you sign up for a 2-year plan. It’s valid for the first 15 months of your subscription and includes threat protection, a high-speed VPN, and more. Follow the link above and use coupon code WIREDVPN at checkout to get the deal.

**How to use a NordVPN coupon**

To use the code, first choose a plan. NordVPN has three plans: Basic, Plus, and Ultimate. The coupon will work on any of them. When you get to the checkout screen, you'll see a prompt to add a discount code. Enter it there to get your discount.

***NordVPN Plus 2-year Plans***

The two-year Plus plan is the most popular and is our recommendation. During sales, 2-year subscriptions qualify for 3 additional months free and discounts of up to 72%. You’ll get a VPN and a password manager (one of our picks in our guide to the best password managers). The Plus plan also includes Nord’s Threat Protection Pro, an anti-malware software, as well as an ad and tracking blocker. The Ultimate plan includes all of that and adds 1TB of online cloud storage and identity theft protection. If you don’t need any extras, NordVPN also has a Basic plan that includes just the VPN. The coupon code will get you a discount on all three.

**Best time to get NordVPN deals**

As we mentioned above, NordVPN always has promotions, but their deals vary. The best time to buy (if you don’t use a coupon) is during holiday sales and special pricing. You can expect free months when you sign up for an annual security plan, 50-70% discounts on VPN plans, and subscription package deals that extend into the beginning of the year. NordVPN will also be running a nice promotion in February.

**NordVPN Friend Referral Discount**

  
If you love NordVPN, you can save even more with our refer-a-friend promo. You’ll get 3 months free for every friend who buys NordVPN through your referral link.

Your friends will get the same deal you got, 3 extra months if they choose the 1-year or 2-year plan or 1 month free if they choose the monthly plan.

**More ways to save money with NordVPN**

Coupons aren't the only deals available. You can wait for a sale (see above) or, if you qualify, there are discounts for students, graduates, teachers, healthcare workers, military, and first responders.

Students get the best deal, saving 77% with Student Beans. You can find more details about this offer on the NordVPN website. You can also save a few bucks by signing up for their newsletter, which features occasional NordVPN deals and coupons. Now is also the best time to save money on NordVPN online security – get 74% off plans with 3 additional months of the Basic, Plus, Full, or Premium plans.

**NordVPN FAQs**

Below are some frequently asked questions about ways to save on NordVPN through upcoming deals, sales, and promotions:

**Does NordVPN offer a free trial?**

NordVPN doesn't offer a free trial. Using a free VPN is not a good idea. Companies that offer free VPN services have to make money somehow, and they usually do so by selling your data.

**Is there a money back guarantee from NordVPN?**

If you don't have a free trial, NordVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you love the service, you can get it through me.

**Is there a NordVPN coupon for a longer subscription?**

Yes, getting a 2-year plan will save you money compared to the annual and monthly plan.

I used to be a moderate to heavy drinker off and on through my 30s. ( more moderate tbh) I’m 44 now. I had stopped for a few years, got really healthy. Last October I went through a depressive bout. Although I drank, it wasn’t anything even remotely like my 30’s.  I was also taking a ton of supplements and not exercising like I usually do. My final unhealthy act was to start drinking red bulls to try and get some energy through the depressive episode. 

Anyway, right about then I noticed whenever I took my supplements in the morning I would catch a really strong whiff of ammonia from my vaginal region. At this time I started having RUQ pain and had to sleep with a heating pad on. I quit everything cold turkey. 

The pain is much better, but I still have that ammonia smell ( though weaker) months later. Sometimes it get even goes away but then returns like if I have a vitamin or a cup of coffee. My diet is excellent 

I’ve only smelled it in my urine once, the rest of the time it is on my underwear.

I used to have very regular bowel habits, 1x per day after coffee. Since starting Zoloft 9 months ago, I’ve had some changes (looser stools and more frequent trips). This coincided directly with starting the medication, and meta mucil helps a lot so I never worried much about it. 

Now today, I went to the bathroom and actually had a good BM. Except, at the end of pushing, a little drop of fresh red blood went into the toilet. Even though I just finished my period yesterday, I’m 95% sure this came from the anus and not the vagina based on wiping. No pain and not a lot of blood, but definitely a bit. I looked at the actual poop and didn’t see any obvious blood. 

Another important thing to note, two days ago my husband put part of his finger up there with no lube during sex. I didn’t notice any blood or pain at that time. 

Is this concerning enough to see a doctor, or should I just continue on and monitor the situation?

Doctor said it was a panic attack (as I had gone through a lot of major life changes). Since then I’ve had different symptoms from joint pain to hives to stomach issues and it just never ends. I thought it was just anxiety but I’ve talked with a therapist and truly don’t think it’s psychological. For the past six months, I’ve seen so many doctors. Tested positive for autoimmune, but then negative for the major diseases by a rheumatologist. Thyroid and other bloodwork look normal. But I’m constantly experiencing new random symptoms. 
I finally had enough energy to go work out yesterday and in the middle, my whole body broke out in hives. I used to exercise regularly and have occasionally felt itchy but never broken out or felt lightheaded. It got better without any meds (off of all meds before my allergy test next week) in 30-60mins. Other than that, I’ve been super bloated and in pain despite barely eating. Was searching online for solutions when I read about MCAS. I feel thankful that my symptoms are not so severe but afraid because they are getting worse each time. 
It feels like no doctor/specialist understands what’s going on and I can’t afford to continue paying for a billion initial appointments just to be sent back to my PCP. I have to return to school soon and am so afraid that I won’t be able to function. I’m also just exhausted. It’s hard to keep up with life when I am constantly sick. I wish my body could be more normal. I wish I could drink coffee and matcha, work out, stay up late, etc. seems superficial but it’s actually so difficult to watch everyone else enjoy themselves while I avoid anything potentially stressful.

So i've been looking forward to buy a Jura J9, question is, is there a way to turn off the automatic Rinse milk prompt at the end of the cappuccino? Is there a way to turn off the automatic rinse system when turning on/off the machine? 

off topic:

Before telling me its a bad idea to not clean the milk system, ok, you can clean it and i won't argue. i want my machine to do whatever i see fit, especially in the morning when we're a lot of people in the kitchen and we need to take our caffeine dose and go on our ways without rinsing,cleaning,emptying trays,etc.. 

I have 3 saeco caffe nova's in different locations. Imo is best machine ever. all 3 of them still work. They don't clog, don't care what water hardness you have, valves are working fine, coffee is strong and tasty. No maintenance, no descaling,has options in menu to turn off every automatic cleaning or rinsing. But no milk, only simple coffee. 

I've had a saeco gran baristo avanti which is a disappointment. Has bluetooth function to start the machine remotely. I've been wanting to make a coffee from bed by leaving a coffee mug there at night. I start a normal long coffee and the machine powers on, and first thing the machine does is to rinse water in my mug, then proceeds to do the coffee in the rinsed wather. The machine clogs a few times in a year, i need to go to the service menu and move the valves a couple of times until i see a small chunk of limestone that comes out the coffee nozzle. The machine has milk carafe and makes an ok cappuccino. After each cappuccino it prompts you to clean the milk function, which fortunately i can skip with the back button.  I can also turn off the machine and press the back button to skip the rinsing at the end. I can also press the back button when turning on the machine to skip the rinsing at startup.  i cannot remove these prompts unfortunately. ",1,1736368748.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

I’ve been on varying dosages of Methimazole since with decent enough progress. I last had blood work done on 12/18 and TSH was 0.23, T4 was 0.6 (hypo), and T3 was 2.5 (borderline hypo). My endo reduced my dose from 30mg to 20-25mg. He said take 20 but if you start to feel like you’ve had too much coffee, bump up to 25. I bumped up to 25 bc I’m just a nervous person in general and then started to feel terrible. It took me a week to figure out that I had increased fatigue, freezing cold all the time, drinking more than double water than normal, and a terrible terrible headache (all symptoms of hypo). I realized this on Sunday and only took 15mg on Sunday. My headache was slightly better on Monday. I’ve taken 10mg Monday, Tuesday and today. 

I have been calling my endo every day with no response so I’m not really sure what to do. I finally talked to the front desk today and he’s out of the office until Monday. Do I continue taking 10mg until I hear from my endo or another course of action? I called my local lab and they charge $100 for a TSH T4 and T3 panel, which I don’t really want to pay.

I’ve been spending a lot of time at home due to some serious health issues and just being at home has been depressing because I love my house but I hate the way it’s decorated. When I bought it a few years back, I stupidly did the whole millennial grey thing and regret it. 

Back then I splurged on a pricier sectional and I wish I would have gone for cream or ivory or a nice green instead of grey, but here we are. I also own this coffee table but I don’t feel like it matches the sofa or my flooring (pic 3). I really want to make my living room feel less sterile, but I feel so limited in what I can do to warm it up or add something to it besides grey. I really like the organic modern look, but I’m struggling to find pieces I don’t just like individually, but that actually fit into a living room where each piece complements the others. 

What colour scheme do I go for to warm up my space or at least make it a bit less depressing and grey? I really love the colour palette in picture 4, but it doesn’t seem compatible with my greyish floor, as well as my coffee table (which is not a solid colour and seems TOO warm). 

I would be willing to get rid of the coffee table and find something else that could fit my space better. I really like wood coffee tables. I’m just hoping to still be able to hold onto the sectional. ",2,1736368412.0,interiordecorating,19,1.0,False

I noticed my bad breath in 2022, meanwhile I tried to go to my doctor twice and she didn't discovered what was wrong and didn't help much

The first time I went I explained that I believed it was probably a stomach issue because some minutes after I finished brushing my teeth the bad breath would come back immediately. She still said that I should go to a dentist and do a cleaning. So I did that, I did a cleaning and I decided to ask the dentist about it too, they said the cleaning would probably solve it and advised me to extract my wisdom teeth, which I also did.

After all that.. My bad breath was still the same, and I started searching a lot online and saw about tonsil stones, which I do very occasionally have even before this started

I went back to my doctor and talked about tonsil stones, my doctor saw my tonsils and just said she didn't see anything and that my tonsils are very small. And she decided I should try a stomach medication for 1 month.

I did that and.. Didn't change absolutely anything.

This makes me feel very bad, no one wants to make people uncomfortable around them and I don't know what else to do.

People around me usually don't notice my bad breath, but now I'm not even sure it's that, what people usually notice it's the smell around the place where I am, for example in my room, I think what smells is my breathing, sometimes I'm in my room not doing much, not opening my mouth and not speaking, and then I leave my room, when I come back I can notice a weird smell, this must be what people notice when they are around me, it has to be my breathing then, probably both because I can smell my bad breath

I dont smoke, I don't drink alcohol nor coffee, I brush my teeth 2/3 times a day and floss everytime before I brush my teeth, I also use mouthwash, none of these help, also I have a bad taste in my mouth most of the time

I'm thinking of going to my doctor again.. I need to find a new job but this is stopping me, I feel very helpless though, I'm very sure it will be in vain again, I have a lot of anxiety so I've been postponing scheduling that appointment, so meanwhile I'm trying to get any help, hints, opinions I can, so please share anything you know or think it can be!

When I first found out that Big Finish were making trilogies of Doctor Who stories in their monthly range I was thrilled. I thought that this would open up a whole new avenue of storytelling by allowing overarching themes and ideas to be explored in ways which hadn’t previously been possible. And the first one they were doing was a sequel to the Key to Time, one of the only real arcs in Classic Who. My expectations were high and I was excited to listen to it as soon as I could!



At this point ten years pass.



You see, I was a teenager in 2009 and too poor to buy Doctor Who audios recklessly back then. But by the time I went to uni and had a bit more disposable income, oh boy, had my hype for the trilogy died down! I’d read enough reviews from people saying it was bad/mediocre that I spent my money on other things instead. And then I got a job and had money so I could afford it! But then I stopped caring about Big Finish so I didn’t buy it then either. At this point a bunch more time passed, when out of nowhere I remembered that the Key 2 Time trilogy existed and decided that \*surely\* it couldn’t be as bad as people said it was. In conclusion: I did eventually buy the trilogy and, oh boy, was it absolutely not worth the wait.



Looking back, I now see that one of the reasons Big Finish introduced the loose ‘trilogies’ in the main range (or I guess the monthly adventures as they are now called) was because it was easier to schedule the same group of people to be free at the same time, and therefore it made sense from an organisational standpoint to have a few stories back to back with a similar cast. But the Key 2 Time trilogy showed they were clearly thinking about what they could do with this new format, and while the Key 2 Time trilogy has a lot of… objectively terrible stuff about it, it has a lot more ambition than most of the other trilogies I’ve listened to. It’s clearly trying to be a big epic adventure to justify the trilogy format, and for that I give it kudos, but it very rarely succeeds in what it is trying to do.



Before we get to the review proper I must admit that I have relistened to The Key 2 Time trilogy exactly once in preparation of writing this article, so understand that any inaccuracies in this review arise because this is extremely poorly researched as I could not be bothered to spend even thirty seconds fact checking. If you notice a problem or mistake I make, please do tell me how and why I’m wrong, feedback is always appreciated. Although you must understand that doing this will ruin my day and make me cry a lot, which may come as a pro or a con depending how twisted you happen to be as a person, but you do you man.

  


\*\*\*

First things first, the elephant in the room. “Key 2 Time” is one of the worst titles of anything I’ve ever heard. Clearly taking inspiration from the Fast and Furious films it decided to throw subtlety out the window and just go for the first name someone thought of on a coffee break. It wasn’t a clever title when it was released, and if anything, it has somehow gotten worse over the years. In terms of design, the styling of the 2 being so much larger than the other words in the logo also makes it look terrible iconographically. It is truly one of the most abysmal attempts at naming and branding something I have ever seen.



And I for one LOVE IT.



Whenever I think of the name ‘Key 2 Time’ I cringe a little internally, and with how jaded and dead to the world I have become over the many years of my continued existence, having any kind of emotional response to something as mundane as a name is a veritable treat!



I’m also a sucker for any homophone which requires additional clarification. If someone said “I really like the Key to Time” you would have no idea whether they were talking about the TV season or the audio trilogy. I mean, sure, no-one with taste would ever say that about the Key 2 Time, but you can never account for the terrible terrible opinions people have. If I was ever having a verbal conversation about this series I’d have to say “I really dislike the Key 2 Time; where the 2 in the middle is the number 2 and not the word ‘to’.” To which the response would presumably be “But isn’t two also a word” and then I would respond “Well, yeah, it is, but in this title it's specifically the number 2, not the word ‘two’ so I had to specify as such.” This would all have been avoided if they’d instead called it 2 Key 2 Time, then no-one would get confused. Anyway, the title is terrible, but it makes me chuckle every time I see it, so it is much more of a plus than a minus. This is one of the only positive things I will say in this review.



\*\*\*



This story takes place in one of my all time favourite eras of Doctor Who. That of course being the “The Fifth Doctor has a very rigid series of companions who he was travelling with at any point, and he never travelled alone, so we have to absolutely fuck with the canon to get a Fifth Doctor story where he travels with X companion(s) in such a way which barely makes any sense if you spend more than a second thinking about it” era.



There is a bit at the beginning of this trilogy where the Doctor shouts “Peri!” to establish where he is in his own personal history, and I find this scene very funny. Like, it’s about as unsubtle as you can get, and I think may genuinely be The Doctor’s opening line. Big Finish knew how much we (the wonderfully rabid fans) would complain were it not explained, and the blazened lack of subtlety in explaining it immediately amuses me greatly.



Speaking of Peter Davison, he’s never been my favourite Big Finish Doctor, as often his performances come off as him seeming a little uninterested and show a lack of understanding of the material he’s performing. This is probably because Peter mostly does Big Finish audios to make money and has gone on record saying he shows up without reading the scripts beforehand, says his lines, then leaves. As a fan of Doctor Who, this is of course disappointing; I would love it if he put as much effort into them as he could, as it would only improve the quality of the work he makes. But writing as someone who has to earn money in order to live, I say do as little work as possible King! Min-max the shit out of your job and get paid anyway. What are Big Finish gonna do, fire you and replace you? Jokes on them, they can’t! Playing The Doctor is a gig for life baby! Do fuck all, take the money and run I say! But anyway, I would describe his performance in this trilogy as slightly above average for him, so that’s nice.



\*\*\*



Amy (not to be confused with Amy Pond) is the companion they introduce in this trilogy. And, unlike most of the other things about this trilogy, I do not have any hugely strong opinions on her. Clara Janson is a fine actress and performs her role consistently  well, but the character she plays is much more interesting in theory than in execution (an absolute CLASSIC trope for this trilogy, it will happen again MANY times).



My main issue with Amy comes from her development; Amy is supposed to start off as a blank slate, and learns from the people she’s with as the stories progress. However, by the end of part one of the first story in the trilogy, she has already cemented herself as a naive but good person. It should take her much longer to become the good person she’s trying to be. We have a trilogy of stories for Christ’s sake, we have room for a little character development between them, but nooooo, let’s get that pesky character growth out of the way before it gets started. But the naive part of her character I actually really enjoy. I think Clara pulls it off well and it lead to some interesting situations and character interactions for Amy, making her feel different from almost all other Doctor Who companions. 



The first story’s climax hinges on Zara (Amy’s sister) trying to convince Amy to use her powers with ill intentions. This could be very effective if we’d already seen Amy struggle with understanding what morals exactly are, witnessing death from an outside perspective and being cold about the whole thing, but she realises after spending time with the Doctor she has a better understanding of what is right and what is wrong, and can make decisions for herself. Obviously none of that happens. Amy becomes good immediately and there was never a moment in the trilogy where you don’t doubt her to do exactly the right thing. This does wonders for the end of the story. And by wonders, I mean it makes me wonder why I’m wasting my time listening to this. But don’t worry, I then wrote seven-thousand words about it, so clearly wasting time is a hobby of mine.



Amy could have been a fascinating case study over the three stories where we see her personality change and develop, but of course that doesn’t happen. And the character we’re left with is… nice. She’s smart and self sufficient, but she hardly feels that different from other Who companions. She’s fine, but at least in this trilogy, she didn’t do loads to win me over.



Zara, on paper, is a much more interesting character than Amy is. She has a lot of the character growth that would usually be seen in a main character, and not a side one. She begins by focussing on her darker urges, before coming to the realisation that she might want to be a good person. The end of her arc is a bit of a whimper though, as The Doctor just says “You’re a good person” with very little evidence to back it up, then they all leave. Taking into account at this point her manipulations and actions have affected the lives of millions of people, and lead to the deaths of many, this is not a hugely satisfying conclusion. Another big  issue with her character growth is because her becoming good is tied to her falling in love, which is a stupid trope and I hate it. Let evil people be in love too damn it!



I really enjoyed most of Zara’s appearances in the Judgement of Isskar, she presents an interesting mirror to Amy, and while you already know she’ll be redeemed (this is Doctor Who after all) you're left curious as to how it’s going to come about. And that’s explored really well in the next story!



Oh wait, never mind, Zara doesn’t appear in the Destroyer of Delights at fucking all. Like, I know that Amy is technically the companion in the trilogy, but The Key 2 Time is very much Amy and Zara’s story. And then Zara just isn’t there for a third of it. This means she has to have a lot of off screen character development between the first and last stories, and off screen development is the best of them all, because then at least then you can't have proof that it was done badly. The most frustrating part is that all you need in the Destroyer of Delights is her being involved in a minor way, either by working for the White Guardian or again competing for the fifth segment. It doesn’t need to be a big part, she literally only needed to be there. Maybe she wasn’t free for those dates, but still, it’s a let down to her character.



The reason this happened is probably because a lot of Zara’s character development came from a Companions Chronicles story, The Prisoner's Dilemma, which is separate from the trilogy and I haven’t listened to it. It might be good, might be shit, I have no clue. However YOU (yes, you reading this right now) could change that! If you pay me a whole £2.99 I will take that money and spend it on a digital copy of The Prisoner’s Dilemma. I will then add an addendum to the end of the article which will read as follows: “You buffoon, you fool, what a waste of your hard earned cash. Imagine giving me money to write this. And yet if this has been added it means someone did. I hope you enjoyed using your money to waste an hour of my precious life which I used to listen to The Prisoner’s Dilemma instead of doing something I actually wanted to do. I thought the story was good/bad. I have nothing more to say. What an absolute waste of my time and your money.” where I will delete good or bad as appropriate, but nothing else will change.



Anyway, speaking of Amy and Zara, why do both Tracers become specifically human beings at the end of the story? I’m sure there’s some explanation in the canon, hell probably more than one knowing Doctor Who, but my knowledge is not so in depth that I could name it off the top of my head. You could literally just say they’re becoming mortal and that would be better as it would actually make sense. Amy spends some time with humans in episode two, but other than that they spend most of their time around other species, so why are they becoming human? It would make way more sense for Amy to become Gallifreyan instead of human. But she doesn’t and I just have to live with being mildly annoyed by this, truly a fate worse than death.



Even when Amy leaves we get the usual writing off of a companion by having them leave the Doctor to chill on Gallifrey because that place seems so Goddamn cool, despite all the evidence that shows it is, in fact, a boring shithole. So when Amy and Zara become human at the end of the trilogy it feels like an excuse to write them out and nothing more. And you could have made Zara Atrian and it would also have made sense, she fell in love with one after all. On that note, Zara falling in love with a rando and leaving is yet another classic companion leaving trope, so I’m glad they managed to include two in a single story. Aren’t we lucky?



Oh, also, Amy and Zara sounded very similar. I often couldn’t tell which of the two was talking outside of (very obvious) context clues. Although in the Chaos Pool where Zara was pretending to be Amy I am genuinely unsure which actress was speaking at which points. But that is almost certainly a skill issue on my part. However, I will still hold this against the trilogy as a whole too! Hire people who I personally think sound more distinct in the future, punks!



\*\*\*



There is a lot of focus on the Black and White Guardians in this story. I think the interpretation of them being old and petty Gods, out for their own personal goals instead of the best interests of the Universe, is an interesting one. It does, however, contradict the canon a bit. But let’s be real, it’s Doctor Who, Tegan deciding she wanted to go to a chippy and get haddock instead of cod would probably contradict at least three different novels and an unofficial audio drama. The canon is a mess, and it’s one of the reasons I love the show.



I really enjoyed The Guardians’ inclusions in the trilogy. I find both the characters fun, and they have good banter with each other as well as The Doctor. The scene with them playing Bridge near the end of The Chaos Pool was a particular highlight, with some very good lines and I enjoyed how they did not seem to care that the universe was ending. All the scenes where they are directly interacting is a fun time, and they spend a lot of time apart from each other so these scenes retain a special feeling throughout.



They did both lack a little development though. I’d have liked to see The White Guardian as having more of a personality than just a rules stickler, and for the Black Guardian I think I needed to see a little more of his chaos. But for minor antagonists they have more than enough characterisation. I was happy to see their inclusion here and genuinely enjoyed them in the trilogy.



Oh yeah, The Grace are in this trilogy too and also elder god things. I don’t care about them so this is literally all I’m gonna write about them.



\*\*\*

The Judgement of Isskar does a couple of pretty unforgivable things right off the bat. First, and most importantly, its name is far too similar to the infinitely better Big Finish audio ‘The Justice of Jalxar’ and I genuinely wrote that title instead of the correct one when I started writing this section. Like, it doesn’t even have the alliteration to make it memorable! And the titular Isskar isn’t even that interesting, which ties into my second main problem about this story, it’s boooooooring.



(I will add that usually I would add an abbreviation for the stories I am writing about so I wouldn’t have to write “The Judgement of Isskar” so many times, but I worry having JOI written dozens of times in an article would potentially lead to some misconceptions, so I have instead elected not to do that.)



So many ice warrior stories seem to end up being melodramatic space opera bore-fests where nothing happens. This story is no exception. Although, to its credit, with a concept of “what if the ice warriors used to be nice and friendly” this doesn’t come as a surprise, so at least my expectations were leveled early. Sure, maybe seeing the slow progress of how a culture changes over the years could be fun, or perhaps really focussing on a single defining event that forced that change could have been interesting. But noooope, the first idea is not explored at all and the second mostly happens off screen. Instead we get to see the Doctor and Amy get offered wares for free and then politely refuse the offers. How fun. (This was sarcastic, it was not at all fun.) There isn’t enough of a conflict here as the Ice Warriors are so initially pleasant, even when things go wrong it feels like The Doctor could probably go “I’m very sorry” and sort all of his issues out. This section of the story also suffers as there is only one proper character introduced here, the titular Isskar, and he is as boring as the place he lives.



Isskar presents a lot of interesting ideas, but he lacks conviction in everything he does, changing his mind far too easily on a series of whims seemingly multiple times an episode. This is literally his whole character arc: “I hate the Doctor and Amy because they destroyed my home.” “No we didn’t.” “Ah yeah, you right, that cool, I was tricked by Zara, that won’t happen again.” \*It happens again\* “Well at least I can sacrifice myself for the Doctor who I no longer hate” and then he can’t even do that right! He just fucks off!



Isskar isn’t the driving force of this story, Zara is; Isskar is just there. Nicholas Briggs does a decent turn as the character, stretching his non-Dalek muscles for a change, but it’s hard to make a character like him compelling. Like, at this point I’ve listened to this story three times and I’ve always forgotten who Isskar is. He isn’t important, but he does insist on being present for the whole story, and the story suffers for it.



The only thing I do like about Isskar is how when he inexplicably turns up a thousand years later than when he met the Doctor and Amy they seemingly don't care at all. The Doctor just goes “oh you must have been put in cryosleep” and immediately moves on with whatever he was doing. Yeah, it makes sense for a time traveller to react like that, but it’s also funny that the Doc ain’t shocked even for a moment. This is the second time he’s met Isskar and he’s already thoroughly done with his bullshit. Which, to be fair, is a vibe.



Luckily the Doctor and Amy are only on Mars for an episode and a bit, but even that is too much. Mars never felt like a living breathing place, it felt like we saw everything they wanted to say about it in a handful of scenes. It is at least a short visit, and the story would need to be dramatically restructured if they wanted it to be any shorter, but it still outstayed its welcome.



Unfortunately the location they replace it with is equally uninteresting. Safeplace, so named because it is a place… that is safe, feels almost as undeveloped as Mars. We do spend a few eps in Safeplace though, so it at least introduces more than one character, which is not something Mars can claim to do. Plus, we are introduced to the first of many comedy aliens in this trilogy, and just like all the other comedy aliens in this trilogy, they decide to make the bold creative choice of having them not be funny at all.



Comedy is very subjective, and what one person finds funny another person may not. So, if any of you think any of this trilogy is funny, know that I think less of you for being stupid and wrong, but you’re free to think whatever dumb shit you want. There is a lot of comedy presented in this trilogy. The Valdigians in The Judgement of Isskar, pretty much all of The Destroyers of Delight, and the Teuthoidians in The Chaos Pool. It does tie the trilogy together thematically at least, and I quite like the, perhaps intended, juxtaposition of comedy with the stakes of the end of the Universe. But then I think that’s handled much better in stories like The Fourth Wall or The One Doctor.



For my own personal taste the comedy would be far more effective here if it lessened more as the trilogy went on, with the first story being a fun romp and the finale dropping the lighthearted tone and having big emotional stakes, as I believe this and would emphasise how serious the stakes were. Killing off the comic relief is also a very effective way of showing that shit got real. This is not what is done at all. It lacks intentionality, the comedy in this trilogy is incidental, which is fine if it’s funny enough, but it isn’t. My main issue is something interesting could have been attempted here with the comedy, but instead they tried to be funny and then failed.



Anyway, the comedy aliens have a silly monarchy. Isn’t that funny? (The answer is no, it is not.) I don’t really have too much to say about the Valdigians otherwise.



My main feeling when thinking about the Judgement of Isskar is apathy. There’s a war in this story, but it’s so poorly directed that you don’t always understand what’s going on, and it lacks stakes because every major character is just kind of meh so the threat never feels substantial. Even when Amy’s being tortured (which the Doc forgives waaaaay too easily for the record) it never feels like the danger is real. Lots of creatures are dying, but it never seems like it’s about the characters we’ve been introduced to, so why would I care?



If it wasn’t obvious, I didn’t enjoy the Judgement Of Isskar very much. It’s my least favourite of the three stories in the trilogy, as it is dull as dirt and the other two are at least entertaining. Everything in The Judgement of Isskar is done better in other Doctor Who stories, and it exists without anything really happening, before abruptly ending. Just like this section of the article. 



\*\*\*



The Destroyer of Delights is probably my favourite story of the trilogy. That is not to imply it is great, if I had to describe it in a word it would be ‘passable’. It’s a fun enough romp with some of the worst music in any Big Finish story I’ve ever heard. Every five minutes the music just goes BWAH BWAH BWAH (which is also the sound I make when I was forcing myself to listen to this trilogy, but that was slightly less annoying because making funny sounds yourself is far superior to having to listen to someone else make them) and it would take me out of story it was so distracting.



The Destroyer of Delights is meant to be funny. However, in stark contrast to the rest of the comedy in the trilogy, it actually succeeds! Oh wait, sorry, I mistyped, it didn't succeed at all. Despite this, the story moves along at enough of a pace that it at least kept my interest throughout. While lacking interesting twists and turns, the story it tells is cohesive and is kept entertaining by the conflict between the White and Black Guardians. This story also probably has the strongest appearance of Amy as a character as she is separated from the Doctor and has to work independently, giving her more moments to shine, and it does pose some interesting questions about Amy and The Doctor’s relationship. Luckily Big Finish decided to quickly ignore those ideas and nothing comes of them. But at least it tried to ask the question!



For those wondering why this story is called The Destroyer of Delights (which, for the record, is a really fun name) it’s because it is said approximately fifteen times an episode, and gets old very quickly. In Sudan at the time this story is set you were not meant to speak their word for death aloud, so euphemisms were used instead, and one example is ‘The Destroyer of Delights’. With people unable to say the word death, or make direct allusions to it, there should be an almost infinite number of ways to refer to it. But clearly the writer came up with about five then decided “Fuck it, that’ll do!”, and then still used ‘The Destroyer of Delights’ ninety percent of the time. This annoyance could have also easily been avoided by simply cycling through the five phrases a little more, so it’s disappointing to not have seen that done.



Also who talks about death that fucking much??? Every conversation people have in this story is seemingly about death. Like, does it come up that often in everyday conversation. Sure, it’s Doctor Who so there’s a threat, but even then it’s a bit much. Someone could be making an omelette and you can guarantee some prime bellend’s gonna go “The destroyer of delight awaits all” and I’m just like “Damn Dave, I’m just cracking some eggs here.” “A cracked head will only hasten your journey to the destroyer of delights, whose name cannot be spoken” at which point I, personally, would kill the guy just to get him shut the fuck up.



The plot of this story is also a fairly trite one for Doctor Who, as “alien lands in the past and needs to fix their ship” has been done, both before and after, better than it was here. The gold then becoming a piece of the Key to Time is an interesting idea but not enough is made of it. The concept of inadvertently causing the thing you are looking for to come into existence through the act of searching for it could have been used to great effect. It is no shock that very little is made of it and instead the story just ends with the Black and White Guardians going “Oopsie! Silly us!” which was still a fine ending, but I know we could have gotten much better.



This whole trilogy really annoys me because so many of the ideas used are good and there was clearly an intent behind them, but then the execution lets them down. Amy and Zara, the Guardians, the Grace, even the Key not being reformed properly. They could all be more interesting than they are. I know I’ve already mentioned this point several times, but this is the biggest problem with the trilogy. The potential is so good, but the ideas are squandered here, in favour of bad jokes and bureaucracy. The Big Finish Main Range trilogies are often at their most effective when their stories are only loosely tied together, with a focus on similar themes as opposed to an overarching plot. But with this there was an option to try something more, to be bold and ambitious, but then it doesn’t even feel like they tried to do enough. It’s just… disappointing.



And the Black Guardian giving no shits about his son, while in character, feels like it needs to be touched upon more. You’re clearly trying to make him less of a cartoonish villain, and then he just does the most cartoonishly evil thing immediately after. And while that is partly the point, it also feels like trying to take two steps forward and then just backpedalling. 



There’s also too many characters in this story, or at least, there are a fair few characters who seem important, then the Guardians show up and they steal all the screen time the supporting cast otherwise would have had. While this is understandable, as the Guardians are important for the trilogy as a whole, it did lead to The Vizier and Hason turning up for a few scenes in part four and making me go “Why are they here? Why did they not get killed off and save me from having to listen to them? What a waste of my time!” And when you’re saying that about the supporting cast, that is not a good sign.



I do like some things in this story though, one of which being the setting. I didn’t have much knowledge of ninth century Sudan, and learning more about it was genuinely interesting. I love historicals, and this one is set in a neat bit of history that hasn’t really been explored that much in Doctor Who. Sure, I could really do with a bit less of The Doctor going around being like “Slavery here is kind of fine! I’ll do nothing about it and talk about what great hospitality I have personally experienced to someone who is literally forced to be here.” I know The Fifth Doctor can sometimes be a bit too nice, but this is pushing it. Have a go about the way these people are being treated! Do something man! Him doing nothing feels almost out of character for him.



So anyway, this story was slightly less boring than the last one. I liked the setting and the Guardians bickering, but they take away from the rest of the cast. A fine story, and it’s rough when that’s the highlight of the trilogy.



\*\*\*



The Chaos Pool is a sequel to The Armageddon Factor. This is a bold choice because the Armageddon Factor is utter shite. But I think this actually presents an interesting opportunity, as making a good sequel to a bad original could lead to the original being recontextualised and allowing the positive parts of the original to be better remembered than its negatives. Luckily the chaos pool realises that that’s actually a terrible idea and just decides to also be bad instead.



If you asked me what the titular Chaos Pool was, I would kind of shrug. It’s brought up a lot, but the descriptions as to what it actually is are vague at best. I think it’s where the Key To Time was formed, but the fact that I’m not sure is not a good sign. It is a place of Legend for… reasons. The way it’s described makes it appear as if this were a place that should be important and cool, and to be fair there is a little timey-wimeyness associated with it, but nowhere near enough for being the birthplace of time. Like, outside of ships being replicated, there’s nothing interesting about it.



Oh, wait, there's one really cool idea, with the Chaos Pool existing at the link between the beginning and end of the universe. This concept FUCKING RULES. Like, there are so many mind fucky things that could come from this. Of course, none of these happen, but that would be expecting too much. Oh wait, no it wouldn’t, it would be expecting exactly what I personally was owed from birth to death. There’s not a single idea explored with the fact that it links the beginning and end of time in any way. Like seriously, just chuck in some stasis pods so you can have people from the future travel to the past, then go into cryosleep and return to the future! You already did this (in a way worse way) with Isskar, why not just have that be foreshadowing? Instead it just turns into two races who didn’t exist at the same time, existing at the same time. This might have been fun if they were popular aliens from the show's history, but they weren’t. And if I see a single person claiming that either the Atrions or the slug people were popular, I have bad news for you. They are not. But the idea was there at least, so that’s something. And the story does have a single other good idea.



Lalla Ward playing Astra was an inspired and clever choice. You obviously think she’ll be playing Romana as she was in the original serial, and there’s some fun hints early on that she isn’t who you believe, but you’ll probably only pick up on relistens. Unfortunately, Romana’s later appearance is underwhelming at best, and Astra is not an interesting character at all. She has personality in the first part, disappears for most of two episodes, and then sacrifices herself at the end. Thanks Astra, well worth it. She did a lot off screen though, changing the planet from being ruled  by a monarchy to an elected parliament, which is a positive change for the planet, but my God, are they really such suckers that they voted their fucking princess to be president! This was your chance to break the cycle of aristocracy, not to have more of it! If your planet is dumb enough to vote a royal into supreme power you deserve to die young, which is what is happening to the Atrions so clearly proves my point.



Anyway, Romana is fine here, but she isn’t around enough to do anything too fun. And the interactions between her Astra aren’t too interesting either. Her appearance did allow Big Finish to pat themselves on the back in the least subtle way possible when Romana said “Well I’ll never be president“ at which point I presume she winked at the camera. Obviously that couldn’t be shown because it’s an audio adventure, but she could have at least said “I’m winking” so we all knew as well. Or maybe just record the sound of a wink and amplify it to a hideous extent so that it bursts the listener's eardrums. That would be better, because then I wouldn’t have had to listen to the rest of the story.



One of my least favourite things in this story (where the title for the single worst bit is a hard fought fight from which I am yet to see a clear victor emerge, bloody and victorious) is the part where Zara changes into Amy for a time. This change has no real impact on the plot, and makes the Doctor seem like he doesn’t care about Amy that much as, despite him working out Zara was Amy almost immediately, just chose to say nothing for… reasons. By doing this he only succeeded in putting Amy in danger. He couldn’t even fall back on saying he wanted to get to know Zara better as he’s so concerned with keeping up the charade that he thinks she is Amy that he never finds out anything about her. This part serves no purpose and is bad and I hate it. But in this trilogy, what else is new.



I don't know what’s going on with the sound mixing the story, but a lot of the time the Teuthoidians are completely unintelligible. At least they never said anything worth listening to, so I lost nothing by barely understanding them. The only other thing I have to mention in regards to the sound design is that the music, while better than in the last two stories, decides to do the most cliche suspenseful string music I’ve ever heard, which when it played genuinely made me burst out laughing mid listen. To be clear, I personally really enjoyed it and it was probably my favourite moment of the story, but it was technically terrible.



I have little to say about the rest of the story. Things just happen in succession until they stop happening. The Doctor destroys the Key, the Black and White Guardians fuck off and something happens to The Grace. Many things happen in the middle, but a lot of them are so poorly directed as to be impossible to understand what they are. Luckily I didn’t care what was going on, so that didn’t affect my listening experience at all either.



I have said a lot of bad things about this story, so you might be wondering if it’s my least favourite of the three to which the answer is: “No, obviously not, I literally said earlier in the article that The Judgment of Isskar was my least favourite, pay attention!” But yeah, while I’d say The Judgment of Isskar is technically better, I definitely enjoyed the Chaos pool more. Was it because I both made and ate a tart while listening to it? Almost certainly, that tart fucking ruled, I am a great baker and that pastry was SHORT. But I also think that this story, while often nonsensical, is rarely boring. And I appreciate the attempt to tie up the things the trilogy set up, even if it wasn’t tackled well. It’s the only story in the trilogy to feature all of Amy, Zara and the Guardians, and this feels like their story, and a lot of the character beats with them are fun. Both Guardians simultaneously saying “Doctor, you will die for this” was as cheesy as it was great. The story is held back by the weight of what it is trying to do, but is entertaining moment to moment, even if it lacks the single central story thread that it sorely needed.



\*\*\*



The Key 2 Time trilogy attempts to do a lot, and while I think it mostly fails, I cannot help but admire its ambition. With the new trilogy format Big Finish was attempting to do something new and exciting with its first attempt, and I cannot knock them for it. But I also feel you really need, y’know, six stories to do a proper sequel to the Key To Time. Trying to fit in all of the plot with Amy and Zara, and the conflict between the White and Black Guardians, made the stories feel overfilled, while also diminishing the effects of the individual tales that are being told in each part.



The Key 2 Time isn’t good. But it tries, and for that I give it the credit it deserves. This is one of the most ambitious Big Finish Main range trilogies, at least out of the ones I’ve heard, and I’m genuinely interested in listening to the other trilogies to see if I have any interesting thoughts about them. And if I do, I might write about them, or I might not. Let’s see how I feel.



Big Finish is at its best when it's being ambitious. When it tries things that the TV show doesn’t want to, or can’t, touch upon. There is so much potential in these stories, and while I can’t recommend that you listen to the Key 2 Time trilogy, I hope Big Finish continues to push boundaries in the years to come. Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed this review, and maybe made you think about an obscure Big Finish trilogy you haven’t listened to in a while. I have also hopefully saved you some time if you were thinking of listening/relistening to it, because long story short, don’t bother.",2,1736368257.0,gallifrey,3,1.0,False

1hwu2fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hwu2fa/moka_pot_espresso_setup_advice_400_budget/,Moka Pot Espresso Setup Advice [$400 Budget],"I recently got a 3-cup Bialetti Moka Pot for my birthday, and I’m looking to upgrade my setup to make better espresso-style coffee. My current grinder is a Braun grinder with limited fineness controls, so I’m considering buying a Baratza Encore ESP grinder. I’ve also been thinking about getting a WDT tool and possibly some kind of temperature-controlled cooktop to control brewing temperature more precisely.

**Details about Me and My Setup:**

* Location: U.S.
* Preferred Drink Types: Love cappuccinos, and would love to be able to make them at home.
* Drink Frequency: 2 cups per day for my gf and I (1 cup each).
* Space: Some countertop limitations.
* Experience Level: Beginner—this is my first serious coffee setup beyond a basic grinder and moka pot.
* Manual or Electric: Ideally Electric
* Candidates:
   * Baratza Encore ESP Grinder
   * 0.35mm, 8 needle WDT Tool
   * Nuwave Precision Induction Cooktop
   * CafeGrace 5-in-1 Milk Frother and Steamer
   * Steel Heat Diffuser Plate

**My Questions:**

1. Is the Baratza Encore ESP a good grinder for moka pot brewing?
2. Is a WDT tool necessary or helpful for moka pot coffee?
3. Does anyone have experience using an induction burner with an adapter for moka pot brewing? Is precise temperature control (e.g., 1°C resolution) overkill, or even possible? Or could it make a noticeable difference?
4. If you’ve used a similar setup, what other tools or practices made the biggest difference in your coffee?

I’m new to this and trying to learn as I go, so any advice would be greatly appreciated!",3,1736368173.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I'm sitting in front of my acrylic organizer right now questioning why I have a concealer that's orange and too dark for me.... and why I have any concealer at all! I have never worn foundation or concealer, so why do I have concealer? I have never worn red lipstick, so why do I have red lipstick? I have never curled my eyelashes... so why do I have an eyelash curler? 

From now on, I'm not going to buy products that I won't use. WHY do I have liquid products when they will give me splotchy red itchy spots? When they will cling to the dry patches in my skin caused by eczema? I've also never worn brown eyeshadow, so again, why???? 

A list of products I'm refusing to buy: 
1. Eyeliners. Ma'am, you have never been good at liquid eyeliner, and every gel liner pencil thing you try rubs off. You have dark eyeshadows to use as liner!!! 
2. Liquid products.  Hello, dry patches, I'm talking to you! 
3. Lip glosses. Why do I bother to try finding lip glosses I like? They end up coming off every time I sip my coffee and then I need to reapply them. The two that I have, I will try to finish, and then only use them again if I get gifted some. 
4. Lip oils. Again, they disappear. What's the point in applying something that ghosts me immediately? 
5. Face products. It causes an immediate rash that takes days and days of eczema repair cream and hydrocortisone to fix... not having dark circles and hiding some blemishes is NOT worth it!! The only exception to this is blush, which again, I have enough of. Also, where did these setting powders come from? 
6. Bobby pins. Unfortunately these disappear into the matrix, along with Lip balms and pens and socks, but they're also always turning up. I have a whole container of them.... and unopened ones in my closet. 
7. Eyeshadows... for now. The rest of these I intend on never buying again, but eyeshadows, when I finish enough of the ones I currently have,  I will buy some again. 


My current beauty inventory that I use: 
(To be compared at the end of the year. These numbers are as of January 1) 
• Lip balm: 8 (finished one a few days ago, now 7)
• Lip gloss: 2 
• Lip oil: 1 
• Lip stick: 8 
• Mascara: 3 (2 unopened) 
• Blush: 6 
• Highlighter: 4 
• Eyeshadow pans: 40 
• Eyeshadow palettes: 5 
• Setting powder: 2 
• Nail polish: 7 
• Lotion: 3 
• Hand salve: 3 
• Perfume: 8 (6 minis) 
• Vaseline: 2 (1 mini) 

For me, this is insane. I don't need 7 nail polishes when the work I do doesn't allow nail polishes on my fingers. I only need one blush and one highlighter. Please, girl, use these things this year. 

Get your stuff together please.

Both of our parents have an apartment that we could live in if we want. The one that my bf's parents have is bigger(75m²) and even tho it is in a really expensive district, we moved there.It wasn't in the best shape and his parents didn't renovate it when we told them that we wanted to live there, but it was doable and we were younger(18yo, both of us) and we didn't care a lot about the shape of our home, we just wanted to live together. It was pretty nice until we found out how crazy his parents actually were. They threatened us multiple times that we're gonna have to move out if we don't do things their way - we changed the old curtains, because they literally stained our fingers black when we touched them, even after we washed them and they threatened us that we'll have to leave if we continue this. It was my childhood dream to have a dog so me and my bf adopted one. When we told his parents they started yelling at us and told us that if we don't get rid of it, we'll have to move out in two weeks. My parents' place was rented out and we didn't have the money to cover rent, aside from living expenses and bills, we were only 18, and were trying our best to balance between uni and low-paying nighttime work, so we had to bring it back to the shelter we adopted it from and it shattered my heart. There were times when my bf's father came at home without warnings, because he had a key, took showers, brought in friends and had us make them coffee and once he even told is that a friend of his was staying the night there and we had to find somewhere else to sleep the night. My bf's mother didn't allow it in the end, but it was a very stressful experience. 
The list goes on and at some point, we couldn't live like that anymore, and at the same time, the woman that has rented my parents' apartment(40m²) decided to move out so we could move in. The place was in such a bad shape, that there was no way for anyone to be able to live there, but my parents made this huge renovation where they changed almost everything - they bought new kitchen cabinets, they changed the floorings, we put on new wallpapers and so on. My parents' financial situation isn't great, but they managed to create this cute little home for us and they did most if it by themselves, my father even learned how to lay on tiles. All of us worked really hard to make the place cozy and everything was alright for a while.
The neighbourhood is really nice - it is a lot cheaper to live in, it has a lot of stores, we live very close to my parents, whom we love and everything seemed perfect. 
Around the first month since we moved in we started hearing yelling and loud noises from downstairs, as if someone was hitting the wall. The noise continued through the whole day and night, it was so bad that the furniture at home was shaking, we couldn't sleep even with soundproof earplugs, because of the vibrations and our cat(we adopted him a month after we had to give the dog back to the shelter) was meowing all of the time because it was stressed. We called the police multiple times, even wrote a legal complaint, but in Bulgaria, where we live, the police can't do much to help in a situation like this. They can only give a warning or hand the neighbour a fine. The neighbour is a retired policemen and he's screaming ""I'm the police! I am the law!"" all of the time, and he is clearly bad in the head. 
Insanity is contagious, so me and my partner started thinking about beating him up or even killing him, but we don't want to risk getting caught, because if there was an investigation, we would be the first suspects on the list due to the complaints that we have filed before. 
Everything was almost doable until my bf got a hernia and had to go through a surgery. He needed to sleep and rest to recover after he got home, but instead he got yelling and lack of sleep. Now, two weeks later, he is better, but we are in exam season in uni and we have to get up early almost every day, which is getting pretty hard with the lack of sleep that we're experiencing. At some point we couldn't take it anymore and went to our old place, so we could get some sleep and quiet to prepare for our exams. 
So here is the dilemma. A home is a place where you have to feel safe and go to, when the outside world gets too much, but our home isn't quiet and we can't rest there. My parents tried so hard to make this place a home and we'll feel really guilty for leaving, but we can't live like this. They tried to help us with this problem too - they tried to talk with the neighbour, but the situation didn't change. My bf's parents really want us to come back to our old place, they haven't rented it out when we moved out and quickly realised their mistakes. Our old place is really close to their apartment and they miss us, they even offered to pay for a renovation. The place they offer us is bigger, closer to our universities, but is located in a pretty expensive neighbourhood, has peace and quiet, but we are not too sure if they'll be nice to us this time, or go back to making us feel bad for living there every day, while the place we live in right now is a lot smaller, has the neighbour problem, is really far from our universities, but it's in a lot cheaper neighbourhood and is closer to my amazing parents. Any advice on what should we do?",1,1736367532.0,offmychest,0,0.99,False
1hwtsj2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hwtsj2,Dad’s Coffee Stations,"I started my coffee journey, almost a decade ago with a Hario Skerton, a French press and a dream. My coffee was always super sour and I didn’t know about any coffee communities to help so I all but abandoned it for the next six years until finding Reddit coffee communities and discovering James Hoffman. Since then I have slowly accumulated a V6 and espresso focused set up that I am very pleased to share with you all and visitors that come over. 

Home setup: I wanted practicality/efficiency blended seamlessly with a clean orderly appearance. Slim outlet cover hidden by the Aiden and all cables routed with black cable covers behind black bar mat to a cable management box hidden by the barista pro. Drawer beneath the espresso machine has all necessary steps I can quickly take out and put back and installed cabinet trash can below that for easy clean up and puck/filter disposal.

Work setup: minimal space to work with but I wanted something also clean and intentional but a chest-high outlet really throws it off—otherwise it’s mostly finished. 

Breville Barista Pro: this is my first and only espresso machine, and it’s been highly reliable and consistent for me, to the point where I’ve even been able to set my wife up to be able to pull shots daily without any of my intervention. Great machine that has gotten me what I want out of espresso, which is typically medium or slightly more roasted shots that are great for Americano and any milk drink.

Fellow Aiden: this machine has then a nice addition to my morning routine since I can save some time in the morning and have almost pour over quality coffee that’s cooled down to the perfect temperature for me to drink it on my way to work. I’m not finding it super easy to dial in so if anyone has some tips, please let me know.

1zpresso K-Ultra: I wanted an upgrade to the built-in Breville grinder that could also be used for poor Rover‘s, which led me to this guy and I haven’t been disappointed yet. Very easy to use and very portable if I’m bringing it to work.

Fellow Stagg: great although my first one would boil over no matter what I did and Fellow burned me on that one bye not offering to help other than basic troubleshooting for what seems like a very well-known issue.

Fellow Ode Gen 2: (not pictured, but part of work setup) very solid filter grinder, and I couldn’t be happier with it. Ionizer works great, gen 2 burrs give me the perfect body and enough granularity in flavor for what I’m looking for. Considered SSP burrs to see the difference, but I can’t justify yet.

I’m fortunate to have a space at work for a pourover setup that I can share with coworkers and take some mindfulness moments, I’ve gotten a few people hooked as well!

Thanks to everyone here for encouragement and help along the way, this is a great community that I couldn’t have done this without. Cheers!

No toilets… another problem… I and my bf (ironic) were patients 0 for dysentery… God I knew I would be nauseated, had fever, and bloody diarrhea in thr middle of nowhere! NOWHERE
But hey I survuved and I had shit in most pretty places… Lile in fuckin hot sand in the middle of dune :D

SECOND!

November… Fuuuu… I was having presentation about my research at some school. Last time I was there… I showed symptoms of stomach bug (I got it feom somewhere else) but I still have the fixation… This specific class (which was the one O was presenting even for SECOND time) is the one you'll start throwing up again. This is just the way you'll get norooooo. My brain was so loud that day… I had to take anti-anxiety meds and leave little but early (after I was done) but hey… I didn't got noro. I was okay… This was tbh my BIGGEST trigger I'm aware of…

THIRD…

December… One pf my big af fear foods are kebab houses… But those random… not big chain kebab restaurants but that random Ahmed you see at a street, yk? What of he toiched the vegetables and before he touched meat? What if… the falafel I'm eating isn't cooked well… what if it was frozen but it wasn't stored right… what if what if what if… NONSENSE!
My bf got me to eat it… Or he made sure I'll be okay. I was spiraling thru that one recenziob tjat said they god noro/food poisining from pizza here… oh frick… But he was like „We will be okay… they got it from different place and it just showed… It is almost two year old recenzion… It had 4,9 stars and almost 100 recenzion… It will be okay… And jf not… Then we'll survuve and I'm paying ypu coffee and icecream!""

1hwtruw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1hwtruw/proposed_italy_itinerary_for_reference/,Proposed Italy itinerary for reference ,"In response to multiple posts, here’s my suggestions. 

1. Rome. Don’t miss it. Spend two nights at least and do all the tourist stuff. 
2. The Amalfi. Naples is hectic, the Amalfi is, IMO, over-rated if you go in the high season. Go to one of the towns (they are all pretty similar) and do a boat trip to Sorrento. 
3. Naples, Pompeii etc and Vesuvius. Allow one day for the volcano and the Phalagrian Fields. Another day to explore Pompeii and Herculaneum. You can skip Naples unless you want the bustle and the risk of losing your wallet or purse. 
4. Capri. Over-run with tourists, expensive. Best avoided in the high season unless you are an Insta addict. 
5. Siena. Check the dates for the Palio. Get tickets or avoid on those dates, but go on the build up dates instead. It’s a half day of exploring. 
6. En route to Florence, check out San Gimignano, Volterra (for younger folks) and Monteriggioni. San Gim is my fav of the three. 
7. Florence. Oh you beauty. Two nights. Uffizi is an absolute must, three hours min. Plus the usual tourist stuff. 
8. Pisa (stop, take a selfie of yourself holding up the tower) and get out of town.  Lucca is better. 
9. Bologna. Another day, another leaning tower. In fact two. You can easily cover Bologna in a day. 
10. Verona. Juliet’s balcony, the market square, the arena. Half day. 
11. Venice. Two days. All the usual tourist stuff. Guggenheim is impressive and so is the location. Take a valoretto to Murano and if you have time, head to Burano for the vibrant colors. 
12. Trieste. An excursion for coffee lovers. 
13. Lago do Garda. My home … the southern lake towns for the Dolce Vita. Riva for windsurfing. Limone for tourist trap shops. Sirmione for the photos (be prepared to walk or pay big for car parking) and Salo for the history (and no much else).
14. Milan. Cathedral, shopping centre, opera (Scala) and the Last Supper if you booked way in advance or paid a scalper. Sforzesco castle and gardens are impressive. 
15. Lago d’Iseo. Pretty and a popular wedding venue. 
16. Lake Como and Lake Maggiore. Colder than lake Garda. And I don’t care which US celebs live there. €10 coffees. 
16. Turin. Shroud. Old city. Mountains in the background. Beautiful Aosta valley. 
17. Genoa. Gritty port town, great seafood, proximity to Cinque Terre. 
18. Cinque Terre. Over-rated and over-populated. All five are pretty similar, choose one. 
19. Forte dei Marmi. Only go if you’re Russian. 

Yeah I missed a few places - Sicily is a trip of its own. In Italy, you can do side excursions to places like Orvieto (cathedral), San Marino (castle, tax dodge), Assisi (pilgrims), Perugia (chocolate), Ravenna (mosquitos and Dante’s tomb), Bari (expensive sun loungers), Lake Trasimeno (reeds) and Bozen (Ötzi). 

If you’re coming for a few days, or a week, then pick 2/3 of these and remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day. 

I’ve made a few typos here but Reddit isn’t letting me update them - enjoy anyway. ",4,1736367426.0,ItalyTravel,3,0.75,False

I'm a 26 y/o guy , 1m90 and 86 kg. 
I feel like I'm happy with my weight but I strugle to lose my belly fat. 
I'm trying to get more fit but it seems realy difficult now.

My diet : 

Skyr 500g a day (55g protein)
Eggs 5 (30g protein)
Wholewheat bread 
Beef or chicken 300g (60g protein)
Rasberry and blueberry 10 each
Some greens
Somedays Rice or patatoes
1 slice cheese 
Coffee


1 .Do you guys thinks this is enough protein and do you have any good alternatives to feel more full? 

2. How much times a week and how long should i lift ?

3. Is walking better then running to burn fat?

4. How long would it take to reach 83 kg while building more muscles?

5.Should I stay at 86kg but with more muscles or go down to 83kg? 

I did a diet without working out 1 year ago and went from 96kg to 88kg in a few months but only with this diet. 
Unfortunatly I lost a lot of muscles too. How can I avoid this in the future?

Started with 8 units injections for 4 weeks and last 2 weeks at 16 units.   
  
I have physical limitations due to severe knee problems so I don't get a lot of exercise other than walking the dogs 3 to 4 times a day for about 20 minutes at a time. I hope to increase my activity gradually as I loose weight, but I'm primarily going to have to focus on reduced calorie intake.  
  
My appetite is definitely lower and I've slif into the intermittent fasting pattern I've been trying to do consistently for several years. With my reduced appetite, I've found that I'm often not hungry until around 3pm or later. So I'll either have a small snack or protein shake and then just have dinner. I'm not being too restrictive on what I eat but I'm not eating a bunch of fast food either. The GLP-1 has made intermittent fasting very natural and easy so I'm either one meal a day or confining my eating window to about 4 hours per day. Outside of that window, I drink black coffee and drink water.  
  
I hope this pattern continues for me because it's very comfortable for me and it's definitely working. I have a long way to go and have no idea what my goal weight should be so I'll see it when I get there.

1hwtn3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hwtn3x/does_laughland_teeth_whitening_really_work_my/,Does Laughland Teeth Whitening Really Work? My Experience and Thoughts,"Teeth whitening is something I’ve always been curious about, especially after years of drinking coffee and tea. Like many, I’ve tried over-the-counter products with mixed results. I wanted something that would actually work without leaving my teeth overly sensitive, so when I came across **Laughland teeth whitening**, I decided to give it a try. Here’s a detailed breakdown of my experience with it.

# Why Choose Laughland Teeth Whitening?

There are so many teeth whitening options out there, from whitening strips and toothpastes to professional treatments at the dentist’s office. Laughland stood out to me because it’s an at-home whitening kit that combines **dentist-formulated whitening gel** with an LED mouthpiece. It’s designed to be effective yet gentle, which was a big draw for me since I’ve experienced sensitivity issues with other products.

# What’s Included in the Kit?

When my Laughland kit arrived, it included:

1. **Whitening Gel**: A clear gel that claims to tackle both surface stains (like those from coffee and wine) and deeper discoloration.
2. **LED Mouthpiece**: This device activates the gel, helping it penetrate the enamel for faster, even whitening.
3. **Clear Instructions**: A simple guide on how to use the product effectively.

The setup felt straightforward and not overwhelming, which was a relief since some kits can be overly complicated.

# How I Used Laughland

Using the kit was pretty simple:

1. **Prepare Your Teeth**: Brush and dry your teeth to remove surface debris.
2. **Apply the Gel**: Use the applicator pen to evenly spread the gel across your teeth.
3. **Insert the Mouthpiece**: Pop in the LED device, turn it on, and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse and Clean**: Remove the mouthpiece, rinse your mouth thoroughly, and clean the device for the next session.

Each session took just 10 minutes, which made it easy to fit into my day.

# My Results with Laughland

Here’s how my six-day experience went:

* **Day 1**: After the first session, I didn’t notice much change, but my teeth felt cleaner. The gel didn’t have a strong taste, which was a plus.
* **Day 3**: By the third session, I could see subtle improvements. My teeth looked brighter, and some of the coffee stains were starting to fade.
* **Day 6**: By the end of the cycle, my teeth were visibly whiter—about 6–7 shades brighter. The whitening looked natural, not overly white or artificial, which was a relief.

The most surprising part? **No sensitivity.** I’ve tried whitening strips in the past, and they always left my teeth aching for hours. Laughland felt gentle but still effective.

# Pros and Cons of Laughland Teeth Whitening

# Pros:

1. **Gentle on Sensitive Teeth**: This was the first whitening product I’ve tried that didn’t cause any discomfort.
2. **Noticeable Results**: My teeth were visibly brighter after just a few sessions.
3. **Easy to Use**: The instructions were simple, and the 10-minute sessions were manageable.
4. **LED Technology**: The mouthpiece helped activate the gel, speeding up the whitening process.

# Cons:

1. **Requires Consistency**: You need to use it daily for six days to see the full results, which might be a challenge for some.
2. **Price**: While more affordable than professional treatments, it’s pricier than drugstore products. That said, the results justify the cost for me.

# How Does Laughland Compare to Other Whitening Methods?

* **Whitening Strips**: While convenient, strips don’t always cover all your teeth evenly, and they often cause sensitivity.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: These are great for maintaining white teeth but aren’t powerful enough to remove deep stains.
* **Professional Treatments**: Effective but expensive and time-consuming, with the added downside of sensitivity for many people.

Laughland feels like a happy medium—it delivers noticeable results without the discomfort or high cost of professional treatments.

# Tips for the Best Results

Here are a few tips to maximize your results with Laughland:

1. **Stay Consistent**: Use the kit daily for six days as recommended. Skipping sessions could delay results.
2. **Avoid Staining Foods**: During the whitening process, try to limit coffee, tea, and wine, which can reduce the effectiveness.
3. **Brush and Floss Regularly**: Keeping your teeth clean will help maintain the results for longer.

# Final Thoughts: Is Laughland Worth It?

Based on my experience, I’d say yes. Laughland teeth whitening offers a balance of convenience, effectiveness, and gentleness that’s hard to find in other at-home kits. While it does require daily commitment, the results were well worth the effort.

It’s not a replacement for professional whitening if you need dramatic results immediately, but for anyone looking to brighten their smile without breaking the bank—or dealing with sensitivity—it’s a solid option.
