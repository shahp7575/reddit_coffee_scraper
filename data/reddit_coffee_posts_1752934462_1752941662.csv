2) Lots of families and it’s a great experience if you have kids.  If you don’t, then don’t get a room facing Surfside as it’s very noisy most of the day.  We had a room facing the ocean and it was night and day difference with noise.
3) We didn’t make dining reservations with MyTime and did not have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table. 
4) The windjammer buffet/cafeteria is crazy busy.  People can behave a bit wild like they’ve never had a meal before.
5) St. Thomas > St. Marteen for shopping and city sightseeing.  
6) St. Marteen> St. Thomas for beach and boating days.
7) They charged us $18.50 per adult in gratuity  each day.  Don’t remember signing up for that.
8) The Staff was so nice. 
9) A gal won $14,700 on a slot machine next to my blackjack table so miracles can happen.
10) We stayed in our room past our 8AM departure time and didn’t have any issues.  They blocked elevators after 9AM.

1m3zp5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1m3zp5j/should_you_try_geesta_charcoal_water_filters_for/,Should You Try Geesta Charcoal Water Filters for Cuisinart Coffee Machines Review?,"**Daily Use Insights on Geesta Geesta09 Charcoal Water Filters**  

Experiencing the Geesta Geesta09 and its utility as a 12-pack replacement charcoal water filter has been an interesting addition to my coffee-drinking routine. As someone who indulges in daily brews with my Cuisinart machine, having an easy yet efficient water filtration system is a luxury I didn’t realize I needed until now. These replacement filters claim to reduce impurities for better-tasting coffee, and believe me, it's noticeable from the very first use.  

**Ease of Installation and Compatibility**  
The straightforward installation process genuinely stands out. These charcoal filters fit seamlessly into various Cuisinart coffee makers, such as the Grind & Brew and PerfecTemp series. My programmable coffeemaker accepted it without a hitch, no frustrating adjustments necessary. Instructions are included in case you’d like a step-by-step guide, but even without them, it’s mostly intuitive. I handed one of these to my friend who owns a Single Cup Grind & Brew, and they reported the same ease of installation.  

**Find the best price for Geesta Geesta09 on Amazon.**  

**Performance and Filtration Quality**  
The effectiveness of these filters is what truly elevates my coffee experience. It’s not just about taste improvement but also knowing that unwanted impurities—like chlorine, calcium, and other odors—are being reduced. The coffee now tastes fresher and bolder, mirroring something close to coffeehouse quality. With hard water in my area, these filters proved reliable when used every couple of months or after around 60 water refills. It's reassuring to know you’re not just making tastier coffee but also protecting your machine from potential buildup issues.  

**Advantages**  
- Exceptional compatibility with multiple Cuisinart models.  
- Noticeable improvement in water clarity for fresher coffee taste.  
- Individual packaging keeps filters hygienic and safe during storage.  

**Materials and Durability**  
Made using charcoal as the filtering agent, the material quality lives up to expectations for such filters. The durability of each filter allows it to hold up well over two months of everyday use, ensuring you get your money’s worth with each pack. This also emphasizes the minimal maintenance required for daily use, saving time and effort.  

**Smart Packaging Insights**  
Each filter comes individually sealed, maintaining its quality until it’s needed. This is particularly useful for those who might not use all 12 filters immediately. The accompanying box is compact and protective, ideal for storing extras and ensuring longevity. I store mine in a small cabinet, and the packaging holds up perfectly without tearing or spilling filters everywhere.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The filters could benefit from clearer labeling for absolute beginners.  
- Takes a couple of uses for the charcoal-to-water ratio to stabilize fully.  
- Not usable beyond Cuisinart coffeemakers, limiting versatility.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
While Geesta delivers a solid product, it’s not entirely alone in this space. Popular competitors like the Keurig Water Filter Cartridges and Delonghi DLSC002 may offer additional features like multi-machine compatibility or removable cartridges that are easier to clean. That said, those alternatives sometimes come at a steeper price or lack the 12-pack convenience Geesta provides. If budget is your priority, Geesta’s filters remain highly competitive without skimping on quality.  

**Price Performance Examination**  
In terms of cost efficiency, this set strikes an excellent price-to-quality ratio. Considering you’re getting 12 replacement filters in one pack, the long-term savings stack up favorably against pricier competitors or single-unit purchases. If water filtration is key to maximizing your coffee enjoyment, the investment here aligns perfectly with the daily user’s needs.

What do you think?,"I'm making this post only because my parter said that if I asked anyone, they would have his side on this, but he didn't want me to ask my friends, so here we are. 

We were walking back home after dropping off a rental car this morning. I had this travel coffe mug and after sipping my coffee few times, I noticed that the coffee was leaking a little bit from the seam between the lid and the mug. This has happened before, so I expressed that there's definitely something wrong with the lid as it's leaking again, or maybe I didn't close it properly. I asked my boyfriend to help and try if he can close the lid better. He checked the mug, drank from it and didn't see anything wrong with it and said to me that it's fine it's not broken, he said it didn't leak for him and that I'm just drinking wrong or something. Now we are starting to argue whether the mug is leaking or not. He just didn't believe me and I got frustrated - The coffee was dripping down outside the cup and the drips stained my light blue sweatshirt, while my partner is arguing that there's isn't anything wrong with the mug, he said I'm just being a baby. (So I'm complaining about an issue that he doesn't see to exist.) I was just getting more frustrated that he couldn't see I was being right about the leaking mug. I then demonstrated how I was drinking, to show that the coffee was not dripping from my mouth and that it was in fact leaking between the lid and cup. Then he tried to drink it himself again and just said that ""oh, it's because when I drink my mouth covered the seam and therefore the coffee doesn't dripple down the cup, but goes to my mouth.""

It seemed like that was the end of the conversation for him, but after a few minutes of walking I continued with saying that I would like him to just address the fact that it wasn't nice behaviour from him in this situation, and I wanted to express that it didn't feel nice to be called out for having reaction about the leaking mug(being a baby).

Lot of things were said, I was repeating myself trying to get through the point that I wasn't just upset about the leak, I just wanted him to address the fact that his behaviour was not nice and show some compassion.
But his argument was that I am being overly sensitive about the mug. He said he couldn't understand it, because the leaking mug would have not bothered him in the first place. He said I am overreacting and if I asked anyone else about it, they would agree.

I was just upset about the situation that the lid was leaking and I when I was looking for help to try to fix the leaking mug and expressed how it was annoying me, I was called for being a baby and got told that the mug was not leaking, and that I was the issue.

He thinks this whole argument was pathetic and I apologise if you agree, but I genuinely want to see what others think.",1,1752940627.0,relationship_advice,4,0.67,False

Recently, I got my hands on the KIDISLE CM9429D - UL coffee maker and put it through its paces. As someone who can't start the day without caffeine, I was genuinely curious to see if this single-serve drip coffee machine with its 3-in-1 brewing versatility would live up to its promises. Here’s my experience broken down into what impressed me, what could’ve been better, and how it stacks up against competitors.

**Design and Size**  
The compact design of this coffee maker is one of its most appealing traits. At just 8 inches deep, 4 inches wide, and 10 inches tall, it fits snugly on my already cluttered countertop. It’s perfect for small kitchens like mine or even a dorm room where counter space is at a premium. The sleek black color, combined with stainless steel details, gives it a modern look, blending well with other appliances. Despite being lightweight at 5.57 pounds, the build feels solid, and it doesn’t wobble when operating.  

**Versatile Brewing Options**  
One of the main features that drew me to this single-serve machine was its 3-in-1 brewing function. It comes with two adaptors along with a reusable coffee capsule, making it compatible with standard K-Cups, ground coffee, and even tea. As someone who can't stick to one type of brew, I found this adaptability incredibly convenient. It also means fewer appliances cluttering up your kitchen, which is a win for anyone short on space. Whether I was brewing a K-Cup for the third time that day or steeping herbal tea before bed, the machine handled it all seamlessly.  

**Performance and Brewing Capacity**  
This coffee maker is designed with five brewing capacities—6 oz, 8 oz, 10 oz, 12 oz, and 14 oz—giving plenty of room for customization. Personally, I stuck to the 12 oz setting most mornings, and it hit my “just-right” caffeine mark. When I had guests over, the 14 oz option perfectly filled their travel mugs. It took around three minutes to brew a cup, which is neither exceptionally fast nor unreasonably slow. While the brew didn’t rival high-end espresso machines, it was flavorful and consistent.  

[Time to see KIDISLE CM9429D - UL cost on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b0dhclg55h/)  

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Every coffee aficionado dreads cleaning their machine, but this one simplifies the task with its self-cleaning function. Holding down the ‘SIZE’ and ‘BREW’ buttons simultaneously activates the automatic cleaning mode. For someone as lazy about maintenance as I am, this is genuinely a game-changer. I activated the function once every week and noticed a decrease in residue buildup. That said, you’ll still need to rinse the filter components manually now and then.  

**Travel-Friendly Features**  
The removable drip tray is a thoughtful addition, accommodating mugs as tall as 7.2 inches. This feature came in handy on mornings when I was rushing to catch the train and relied on my travel mug to fuel my commute. However, I noticed the machine struggles a bit when brewing directly into taller mugs—it requires you to align the mug properly unless you want spills.  

**Pros**  
- Compact size fits easily on kitchen counters or tight spaces.  
- Offers comprehensive brewing options, from K-Cups to ground coffee and tea.  
- Five cup size options meet various coffee-drinking preferences.  
- Equipped with a self-cleaning function, reducing manual maintenance.  

**Limitations**  
- Brew strength might not satisfy those who prefer a bold cup of coffee.  
- Slightly noisy during operation, especially early in the morning.  
- The reusable coffee capsule can be a bit tricky to clean thoroughly.  

**Competing Products**  
When sizing up this coffee maker against rivals like the Keurig K-Mini and the Black+Decker Single Serve Brewer, a few distinctions stand out. The Keurig K-Mini falls short in offering a tea brewing option, while this machine’s 3-in-1 capability provides extra versatility. On the other hand, the Black+Decker model offers a similar compact design but lacks the stainless steel thermal mug that comes bundled with the KIDISLE. However, both competitors run a tad quieter than this model, which can be a dealbreaker for light sleepers.  

**Money's Worth**  
Looking at its features and overall performance, I’d say the KIDISLE CM9429D - UL provides solid value at its price point. It’s budget-friendly for what you get, considering it includes a reusable filter and a travel mug—two things I’d probably end up buying separately with other coffee makers. Sure, there’s room for improvement in brewing strength and noise reduction, but for a coffee maker that’s versatile, reliable, and fits seamlessly into small spaces, this one ticks many boxes.

It centres around a genetically engineered assassin who's able to use advanced math to determine how to achieve the desired future by eliminating a single person (kind of like that one episode of the Twilight Zone). After taking out the target, the assassin changes their entire body, including age, size, gender, whatever.

Their first kill is a trial run by the organization that developed them. I don't remember what the goal was, but they took out their target with a needle to the brain stem. They go rogue after that, and eventually take out a person whose death causes the destruction of the organization.

After every regeneration, they become better able to determine their ideal future. Before the first kill, they spend weeks plotting charts before they could figure out who needs to be eliminated. The MC's final kill is their own self, years later. It's explained around then that their ability not only destroys whatever was meant to be removed, but also prevents it from coming to be again.

Scenes that stick out:

A female ninja-type assassin is trapped by a carnivorous plant (part of a rich person's security system) that causes intense sexual stimulation by infusing the victim's body with pheromones. Because she's trained to use her sexual organs as a weapon, the muscles damage her internal organs, and the MC debates whether to put her out of her misery before her uterus kills her instead.

The MC enters the office of a sympathetic detective or military officer who knows how they operate. The MC moves a coffee cup to another part of the desk, triggering a memory in the other character of someone explaining that a single minor change can alter the trajectory of the future. Soon after, bad guys storm the office to kill the MC. The detective reaches for their mug to use as a weapon, but it's out of reach because it was moved by the MC from where it usually sits. This leads to the MC's death.",1,1752940492.0,tipofmytongue,2,1.0,False

I've suffered traumas but it's nothing that warrants the yearning for death. my family is well off, we eat good food, have a warm home. both of my families (divorced parents) are caring and loving and accept me for who I am. yet I still crave death every single day, I have everything good in this world and I still want to leave it. why? I don't understand. I attempted suicide for the first time in May this year and ended up in an institution for nine days after. and it didn't make me appreciate life, or regret attempting. I felt regret, but for not taking enough medication. if I had done more than that I would've been dead. and I think about it every day. the only reason I haven't tried to kill myself again is because of the guilt I feel. 

the day I got home from the institution I spent the entirety of it with my family and bf, who took me shopping at my favorite store and got me coffee. and that night I still curled up in bed and cried about wanting death. I've been suicidal my entire life, and I've been self harming since I was twelve, now 18. does anyone know why im like this? all my therapists and psychiatrists always ask me what triggers my suicidal urges but there's never a trigger, it's just always there. there's never a reason. and they never understand that.

I first noticed the erosion almost a year ago, as I noticed my teeth were getting progressively more translucent, and I’d wake up with white lines on these teeth, but they’d fade throughout the day. I booked an appointment with my dentist and they confirmed that there had been enamel erosion on these front teeth, likely due to my use of apple cider vinegar to treat my low stomach acid (i struggle with IBS, and apple cider vinegar is one of many things that  tried for it). She prescribed me duraphat to use once nightly, and told me to use a soft brush and avoid acidic things which I do for the most part, I don’t smoke or drink alcohol or fruit juices oftenC but I do drink tea and coffee, which I’ll also be cutting back on now. As well as using ACV, I am guilty of brushing my teeth very hard and brushing them after eating, which surely also contributed to this issue. Since then I’ve consistently used the duraphat, and only use soft brushes But I don’t think this has helped stop the progression of the erosion as my front teeth have now developed visible grittiness and look yellower. What can I do at this point to stop the erosion furthering?",1,1752940110.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

I made some mistakes when I bought my first sectional, and I want to share what I've learned so you don't make the same ones.

First, clear out your room completely. You need to see the actual space you're working with. Grab a tape measure and start with the basics - measure the length and width of your room. But here's what most people forget: you need to account for walkways. You should leave at least 30 inches of space for people to walk through comfortably.

Don't forget about your doors! I've seen people buy beautiful sectionals only to realize they can't get them through their front door. Measure all doorways and hallways the furniture will need to pass through. Also, consider any stairs or tight corners if you live in a multi-story home.

Now for the actual sectional space. Here's my method:
- Use painter's tape to outline where you want the sectional
- Mark the dimensions on the floor
- Consider the depth (usually 36-40 inches for most sectionals)
- Account for the chaise if you're getting an L-shaped design
- Leave at least 18 inches between the sectional and coffee table

If you're ready to start shopping, I've found some great options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/sectional-sofa

Don't forget about your windows and heating vents. You don't want your sectional blocking natural light or air circulation. Also, think about your TV placement - most people want their sectional facing the entertainment center.

I also recommend taking photos of your space from different angles. This helps when you're shopping online and trying to visualize how different pieces might fit. Speaking of shopping online, I've had great experiences with this collection: https://explorehomedeals.com/sectional-sofa

One last tip: factor in any additional furniture you plan to keep in the room. Side tables, lamps, or accent chairs will all need their own space. Remember, a crowded room isn't comfortable for anyone.

These measurements might seem like overkill, but trust me, they're worth it. A well-fitted sectional can transform your living space into the perfect spot for movie nights, family gatherings, or just relaxing after a long day.",1,1752939928.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Normally, I wouldn’t get involved, but something about his expression pulled at me. I hesitated for a moment, then walked over and asked if he was okay. He looked shocked that someone noticed, and we ended up talking for over an hour.
Turns out, he had just lost his job and received an eviction notice all in the same day. He had no family in town and was contemplating the worst. I listened, offered support, and gave him contact info for a local nonprofit I volunteered with that offered job coaching and housing assistance.
Fast forward to today: he’s now working as a case manager at that very nonprofit. We stayed in touch, and he tells me the moment I said “Are you okay?” changed everything for him. He even says it saved his life.

1m3z6my,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindfulnesschallenges/comments/1m3z6my/dance_before_the_music_is_over/,Dance Before The Music Is Over,"Live Before Your Life Is Over.

Introduction  
Life is a fleeting song, each moment a note in an ever-playing melody. Too often we find ourselves standing at the edge of the dance floor—watching, hesitating, waiting for the “perfect” beat, the “right” partner, the “sure” step. But the music never stops to rewind; it simply flows forward. “Dance before the music is over” isn’t just a catchy phrase—it’s a call to action: seize your moments now, embrace uncertainty, and live fully before your life’s final chord fades away.

1. The Metaphor Unpacked  
• The Dance: Symbolizes action, engagement, creativity, joy.  
• The Music: Represents time, opportunity, life’s passage.  
• The Ending: Mortality, missed chances, unfulfilled potential.  

Just as a dancer surrenders to rhythm, we must surrender to life’s flow—allowing ourselves to be moved, to adapt, to express. Waiting for perfect conditions often means never stepping onto the floor at all.

2. Why We Hesitate  
a. Fear of Judgment  
   – Concern over others’ opinions can freeze us in place.  
b. Perfectionism  
   – “If I can’t do it flawlessly, why start?”  
c. Comfort Zone  
   – The familiar, even if dull, feels safer than the unknown.  
d. Regret Aversion  
   – We imagine future blame (“What if I fail?”) more vividly than potential success.

3. Practical Steps to “Dance” Now  
a. Start Small  
   – Experiment with micro-risks: share a poem, join a community class, strike up a new conversation.  
b. Set “Expiration Dates” for Decisions  
   – Give yourself deadlines to decide on opportunities—travel plans, career pivots, personal projects.  
c. Reframe Failure  
   – View each misstep as a rehearsal toward mastery and growth.  
d. Cultivate Presence  
   – Practice mindfulness: savor the taste of your morning coffee, notice the rhythm of your breath, feel the sun on your skin.  
e. Surround Yourself with Encouragers  
   – Find friends, mentors, or online groups who cheer your steps and hold you accountable.

4. Overcoming Common Roadblocks  
• “I don’t have time.”  
  – Time expands to fill what we prioritize. Carve out even 10 minutes daily for something that ignites your spirit.  
• “What if I look foolish?”  
  – Most people are far more focused on their own routines than on critiquing you. Plus, authenticity often inspires admiration.  
• “I’m too old/young.”  
  – Age is merely a number. Legends from all eras—Martha Graham in dance, Grandma Moses in painting—remind us that passion transcends chronology.

5. Real-Life Inspirations  
• A corporate executive who traded boardrooms for a surfboard at fifty, discovering balance and joy in the waves.  
• An empty-nester who launched a part-time bakery, turning a lifelong sweet tooth into a neighborhood gathering spot.  
• A retiree who finally enrolled in salsa classes, igniting friendships and confidence she’d set aside for decades.

6. The Payoff of a Danced-Out Life  
When you choose to dance:  
– You accumulate fewer “what-ifs” and more stories.  
– You discover hidden strengths—resilience, creativity, empathy.  
– You inspire others to step onto their own floors.

Conclusion: Your Final Encore  
The music playing right now is unique—its melody will never return in the same way. Will you watch from the sidelines, or will you move? Each step you take—no matter how small—echoes into your future. So, loosen your shoulders, quiet doubt’s inner critic, and answer life’s invitation. Dance before the music is over. Live before your life is over. The floor is yours.

A bit of a different post from the normal frugal suggestions or discussions, but as a frugal person who just became a first time homeowner, I'm curious if anyone else experienced what I experienced: Essentially feeling like I could ease off frugality just a bit. 

Background: I've been very frugal forever but especially when I went to college and even more so when I started living in an apartment and renting. Admittedly, a big part of me being frugal has always been wanting to buy a house. I hated renting with theack of control, feeling like money was being wasted and not going towards either a loan or the interest on said loan, and so I put a large amount of savings into a possible home down payment fund. However, I've always been frugal even besides this, wanting to just save for my future and whatever might come ahead of me. 

After buying a house though, things feel different. Sure, I'm paying even more monthly for housing, as I moved to a bigger space. I also have a long list of repairs I need to do eventually. However, I feel like this ever changing goal number of a down payment is gone now. It's like all of this anxiety around ""can I ever afford a house""? Isn't there anymore. The place isn't huge, but it's a home that I really love, still has room to grow into, and is managebale to live in forever if I needed to. 

So now, when I go get a coffee out, I still budget it out in my head off how much I've been spending lately, but I don't feel this slight dread like I'm going against the thing I need to be focusing on.

Hey folks,

I’m teaming up with a friend to help out solo SaaS builders, early-stage founders, or anyone who needs a clean frontend for their product but doesn’t have the budget (or patience) to hire an agency.

We both enjoy designing and building things from scratch, so we’re taking on a few people this month who might need:

A simple landing page or 1–2 page marketing site (hand-coded, no templates)

Custom UI for a small dashboard or frontend for your SaaS

Visuals or design elements made just for your use, not copy-pasted


This isn’t some agency or startup haha it’s just the two of us, doing this because we love the process and want to build a solid body of work and personally aren't good at starting something of our own. 

In return, we ask for something small, a meal, a coffee, or even just a kind note we can use for our portfolio. Nothing fancy. (Fine even if you don’t have a penny ❤️)

If you’ve got a project, tool, or idea that could use a frontend, or just need someone to make things look good and work smoothly, drop a DM or comment below.

Happy to even chat and debug together on something cool for fun

# TL;DR: Farm the Deep Desert from 4am-9am, and all your problems disappear. Peak hours are griefer central, but off-peak is chill oldfags sipping coffee and stacking spice with zero drama.

# This is my first real survival game outside of about 20 hours in Valheim, which I enjoyed but never got into base building—it's just not my thing. In real life, I'm the same way: I built a 4-bedroom house 3 years ago, and all I've decorated it with is a basic living room set from a generic furniture store, a 100-inch TV on the living room wall, and a 90-inch one in my bedroom. No artwork, no plants, no frills—just the essentials like a badass TV and somewhere to sit. I'm perfectly happy in spartan conditions. My bases in games reflect that: box shape, power system, water system, storage, refineries, and fabs that I build to craft then instantly disassemble. No lights, no furniture, zero creativity, and that's what keeps me content.

# With that in mind, I wanted to share my anecdotal experience in Dune: Awakening because I've seen so many posts about the Deep Desert frustrations mirroring what I went through. I started as a total solo player, speedran the Hagga Basin, hit the wall in DD, nearly quit, and evolved my style to make it work. If you're a minimalist solo type like me, this might help. Spoilers: it involves guilds (kinda), smart timing, and embracing the rat life.

# Hagga Basin: Speedrun Bliss and Optimized Efficiency

# I dove in focusing on trooper skills (only up to tier 2—big regret now, should've specced into planetologist passives for solo farming). The Hagga Basin was a thorough enjoyment: I speedran to T5 by optimizing runs, strategically moving bases as I climbed resource tiers, and playing at my own pace without any pressure.

# My final Hagga setup was a spartan base at the end of the canyon in the eastern shield wall—perfectly placed next to a POI with enemy NPCs for easy bodies-to-water conversion, tons of aluminum, and a quick ornithopter loop for T4/T5 blueprints and thopter components. It was a short flight to jazmium for dura plates too. I kept a small refining outpost by the Anvil to process iron/steel/cobalt paste from buggy runs back to the basin. This is when things really clicked: I had a satisfying operation going, always moving, a few steps ahead. I'd hit test stations or other POIs as needed while steadily building full T5 rare gear, weapons, compactors—you name it.

# I soloed everything undergeared (T5 test labs in steel green gear with basic skills), and it felt like the easiest game ever. No guild, no fuss—just me vs. the desert. As DD loomed, I read Reddit threads, watched solid YT vids (shoutout to Pwnyhof—chill guy with based strats), and planned my solo endgame. I refused the blackpill coping I saw everywhere: people quitting, saying T6 was useless and T5 was ""beating the game"" as a solo. Nah, fuck that—I'd made it this far and was hyped for the rat life, snagging spice where I could and succeeding where skill-issue players couldn't.

# I prepped hard: built a pristine T4 thopter, T5 thopter, T5 assault, and kept my OG beat-up T4. Stocked reserve dura, alum, cobalt paste, etc. Then, transition time.

# Deep Desert: From Cautious Start to Absolute Disaster

# Built a little FOB on the edge of PvP, due south of a fat titanium/strat node, and got to work. Played super cautious—avoiding players, ignoring spice at first, focusing on titanium and strat to spin up plast production. One bite of the elephant at a time.

# At first, it went smooth. Ignored the global chat screeching about griefers. Even joined a pickup group for a testing station—we melted it, scored nice items and BPs. Let's fucking go, easiest game ever.

# But then I got comfortable, and disaster struck. If someone bitched about it on Reddit, it happened to me: glitched out on a downed ship, couldn't take off. RIP T5 thopter and full rare T5 gear set. Tried soloing a testing station with my ""l33t"" skills—survived 45 mins but died. Went back for my corpse, died twice more to gankers who showed up. Got rocketed on titanium island; watched the guy push my thopter into the desert and thumper it. RIP T4 thopter. Went for spice on a medium node—dive-bombed out of nowhere, assault thumpered. RIP.

# Hobbled back to Hagga after getting mollywhopped, burned through reserve mats rebuilding thopters, ran POIs for new BPs. After a day and a half, I was regeared with a smaller fleet... and lost them all over the next 2 days. Told myself this was a waste of my limited playtime and was ready to quit.

# Evolution: Joining a Guild (Against My Wishes) and the Magic of Off-Peak Farming

# Figured fuck it, last chance—joined a small guild despite my solo vows. Total game-changer. During peak hours (6pm-2am), I still play mostly solo, but guild chat gives situational awareness. I farm safely while some PK and others farm. Visited the guild base once (gave someone a ride), but I stick to my solo FOB—now upgraded with a large spice refiner, large ore refiner, adequate power/storage/water, and a big roof hangar for refineries, 2 scouts, and an assault.

# I'm back to cooking: plenty of melange, plast, mats. Full T6 CHOAM, T6 tabr boots, working on rare T6 weapons/gear BPs. Now able to contribute extra spice and plast to the guild in return for the protection and situational awareness/support.

# The real key? Adjusting playtimes. If you're solo or small guild, forget spice farming during peaks. Instead, I either skip Dune or stick to Hagga Basin (keeping dura/alum/cobalt ops running, gathering corpses for DD base, finishing ignored quests from my T1-T5 speedrun).

# I'm 45, so this 4am-9am slot is full of us old men drinking coffee, shooting the shit, and farming spice hand over fist. Big fields are super chill—griefers are almost 100% no-life sweats who crash by 4am (at least on my server). It's free large fields with happy farmers side-by-side.

# I go naked except soft steps, compactor, litrejon, and power pack—no fuel, shield, or suspensor. Non-stop: fly out, fill assault, fly back, process, repeat. Easily 30-50k spice per session. Mats from crashed ships + adv survival fab for plast plates.

# Bonus: My girlfriend's happy—I don't play 9pm-midnight anymore, spend time with her. Adjusted sleep from 2am-7:30am to 11:30pm-4/4:30am (same hours, just earlier). Now I have time for coffee and a nice breakfast instead of rushing to work. Feels good man.

# If you're hitting the DD wall, try off-peak farming and a loose guild alliance. It turned frustration into fun for this spartan solo player.

I purchased a coffee table off marketplace and it's overall very nice! However, there is an issue with it that it never gets visually clean. It seems almost like it has a coating to prevent water rings or something like that. 

There is a waxy film or residue on it which is impossible to get clean. It is almost like it smears around and looks foggy on the surface.

I'm not sure if this is a coat that the table was made with or if this perhaps some residue from the previous owners. 

I've  tried cleaning it off with a multipurpose cleaner, scouring pad, pledge cleaner, but it just smears this foggy residue around and ends up looking like the photo (It  looks worse in real life than the photo captures). The photo is right after I tried cleaning it.

I don’t know what this’ll turn into. Odds are I’ll get called a LARPer, and this whole thing will be tagged as stale copypasta. But I genuinely feel guilty. So here it goes.

I’m 21, postgrad student, live in Moscow. Recently, I started spending more time at our summer house. It finally got finished, and I just like it out there. The whole area’s full of old folks—veterans WW2, mostly. The land was originally handed out to them back in the day, and barely any are still alive. Their kids are old now too, and their grandkids don’t show up much during the school year. So by fall, it’s all retirees left. They like me. I’ve got decent hands, help with fixing stuff, don’t ask for anything in return. In exchange I get homemade food, fresh veggies—stuff like that. I don’t grow anything myself except some lazy onions and horseradish, but I do love foraging. Mushrooms, berries, hazelnuts. I love the forest, probably the main reason I keep coming out here.

Anyway, it started on one of those fall days. There was some big sports thing on TV, and my next-door neighbor (old dude, looks 80 but is probably 60—drinks like he’s trying to die) got his satellite dish busted by some local punks with a bottle. I was heading into the woods—knife in my pocket, face wrapped in a rag, cap on, boots and pants tucked. Looked ridiculous, but better that than coming back covered in ticks and mosquito bites. The path into the forest runs past his plot, and as I walked by, I saw him watching me with that foggy “been drinking since noon” look in his eyes. He called out just as I passed his fence. I stopped and asked what’s up. He seemed kinda awkward, but eventually asked me to take a look at his satellite. Felt bad saying no. I knew if I didn’t get into the woods early, everything good would be gone, and it looked like rain. But still—he’s a neighbor. Can’t just leave him hanging.

Messing with satellite dishes is hell. Takes forever to align it right. We wrestled with it for a long time, but finally, the picture came back on. He lit up like a kid. Invited me for a drink—hard pass. My liver wants to live. I told him I had to get going, and he scratches his bald head like he's about to spill state secrets. Says: “Sorry for holding you up, kid. Listen, since you’re heading out, I’ll give you a tip. There’s this spot closer to the tracks. Not too deep, but mushrooms grow like crazy. Been going there for years, always come back with a full basket.” Of course, I said yes.

He quickly scribbled out a map. The place was a little ways off the tracks, down in a ravine. Our forest is kind of pear-shaped, cut across by a railroad. It’s not Siberia-tier, you can’t get lost-lost. Worst case, you just walk till you hit the edge. It was around 2PM, so I figured I’d go straight there—no point going home first. Mosquitoes were already buzzing, so I kept up a good pace. About a third of the way in, I heard thunder.

Side note—I always carry a netbook with a 4G SIM. No smartphone, too stingy for that. The netbook works fine, and honestly, if it weren’t for that habit, I probably wouldn’t be writing this right now.

Anyway, I wanted to get to the spot fast. Going back felt like a waste, so I looked at the old man’s map. It was weird. The trail was a straight line for the most part, but right where I was, it made this weird loop like a detour for no reason. Looked like something you’d do to avoid a fallen tree or a bad slope. I figured I’d just go straight through. What’s the worst that could happen?

At first, the mosquitoes vanished. Which was weird—usually, they swarm more right before rain. But they were just... gone. I probably wouldn’t have noticed if it wasn’t for how dead quiet it got. Like, forest-quiet is one thing, but this was unnatural. Birds were chirping somewhere in the distance, but around me—nothing. Dead silence. Took my headphones off. Still nothing.

Then I saw a clearing. Didn’t expect one this soon—it was still a ways to the train tracks. Got a bit hyped. Clearings sometimes mean strawberries. Yeah, no. What I found wasn’t a berry field.

Right in the middle of the clearing: an old brick foundation, half collapsed, mossy as hell. Just a stack of stones in a rough rectangle, overgrown with weeds. If I’d been in a different mood, or if I’d processed everything like I am now, I might’ve just walked away. But no. I had to peek inside.

There was a hatch. Old, half-rotted, wood. It covered a hole that went deep down—too deep. I tried lifting the lid, but the wood just snapped in half and fell inside.

Then came the first real spike of fear. First, because the wood fell way too long before hitting bottom.  
And second—when it landed, it splashed, but not in deep water. It sounded wrong, like something echoing in a cistern or an empty well. I instinctively jumped back. And then the dread hit.

I realized how alone I was. Middle of the forest. No signal. Rain’s coming. No one around. And that crash had been loud. I felt like a hundred invisible eyes were suddenly on me. Like the whole forest turned to stare. I stood frozen for a second. Then it passed. Felt stupid for panicking.

But then I looked into the hole.

Two eyes stared back. Way too far apart to be human. Just... glowing faintly in the dark.

I couldn’t move. Just stared back, paralyzed. Then thunder cracked again, and I snapped. Ran. Didn’t look back. Didn’t care about direction. Didn’t care about anything. Branches slashed at my face. I ran like hell.

Somehow ended up near the edge of the dacha village. Still had to walk through the rain, but seeing houses again calmed me down a bit. Still didn’t dare look back at the forest. It felt like it was watching. Got to my house, locked everything, turned on all the lights, collapsed into bed, and blacked out.

Dreams were fucked. I remember teeth. Clacking, two rows. Something like an inside-out dog’s head flying after me. Slowly. But no matter how fast I ran, it kept getting closer.

Next morning, around 10, someone knocked. It was the old man. Red-faced. Hungover? Maybe not. He looked relieved just seeing me.

“S-sorry, kid... stupid old man…” He trailed off mid-sentence. His expression changed, like he remembered something he shouldn’t. Then he just said “I’ll be going now...” and walked off.

I wanted to ask something—anything—but nothing came out. The moment I mentally replayed what happened, it all sounded so stupid. Like I just got spooked by shadows and bolted. But he came. He came to check on me.

I decided to leave for a while. Then I noticed my netbook was gone. Must’ve dropped it during the sprint—or maybe right when I panicked. Whatever. Even if I had the balls to go back, it’d be long gone.

Could’ve ended there. But it didn’t.

When I got home, I couldn’t log into anything. My VK account (The Russian Facebook equivalent, which used to be popular in the post-Soviet space) —locked. A couple of forums I posted on—banned. Only thing that worked was IRC, and none of my usual channels had any users.

Trying to distract myself, I called my girlfriend and we met up at a cafe. Two hours later we were having coffee when she said:

“Someone hacked your VK while you were at the summer house.”

“What, did they post weird shit?”

“Not really. At first I thought it was you messing around. But then it got... creepy.”

“Like what?”

“They kept asking about feet.”

“...Feet?”

“Yeah.”  
She showed me her phone. A wall of unread messages:

Dozens more. Just as messed up.

I went pale. Changed the subject. Next day I managed to recover my email—had a phone number linked. Inbox was spammed with gibberish, unreadable characters. No converter helped. Scrolled through pages of that garbage, then finally saw a normal email.

From a forum admin:

I emailed them explaining it was a hack, asked for examples of what got posted. No reply.

Made a burner account and asked around. One guy replied:

That same day my girlfriend was hospitalized.  
She fell down the stairs.  
Broke both legs.  
Doctors said it could’ve been worse—she almost lost them. But still: three fractures.

So yeah. I think I let something dark into the internet. I’m sorry, Anon. I really am.

Yesterday I got an email.  
Sender: me.  
No message body.  
Subject line: GIVE IT BACK.

I think I’ll stay offline for a while.

Ideal would be a coffee shop or cafe that isn't that busy and would welcome 4+ people sitting in their place ordering pastries and/or coffee. When I went to one in Rockville, they were at a place that had multiple rooms so us taking up 2 tables wasn't a problem.

Metro station accessible is key. For instance, Merry Pin is a great location but it's a 15 minute bus ride from the nearest stations.

1m3yysn,https://i.redd.it/xck6csj6nudf1.png,Passed the Exam,"Hello, this is what I did to pass first attempt-- hopefully it's helpful to someone.  I do have a finance degree and enjoy finance/investing, so that context helped for some of it.  It did not help with learning all of the rules and regulations, state vs federal, definitions, exceptions, exemptions, exclusions etc.etc.

I used Achievable:
-Study time ~68 hours, over 1 month
-Went through all of the book material, with the quiz after each lesson.
    -I sometimes skimmed with a *very* familiar topic but this was rare
    -I recommend using the audio, and listening at 1.25-1.5x speed.  This helped greatly when I got tired of reading.
    -If I bombed a post-lesson quiz bad enough I retook it on the spot, that seemed to help.
-I kept up with the review questions for a little while, but after slacking for a few days ended up ~1,100 questions behind on the day of exam; towards the last days I gave up on catching up and focused on practice exams instead.
-On test day I ended up with 89% 'Exam Readiness', nice 

Practice Exams:
Besides the Checkpoint/Chapter exams, I did 4 practice exams:
Scores were (in order): 75, 78, 81, 83
-After each I clicked through the whole exam, not just incorrect answers because sometimes I would make a correct guess on something I didn't know.  I suggest finding things you are less than 70% sure about and making a little note on a pad or something.

The Test Itself:
-Yes it is as tedious as the practice questions, I know it's not all necessary information to be an advisor yada yada but don't make the mistake of disregarding small bits of info.
-There are some softball questions too don't worry
-Understand decently the regulatory differences between IAs, IARs, BDs, Agents, and how state/federal laws apply to each of them.  If you don't know those acronyms get studying

.... Besides that it's mostly test taking skills, which I will now summarize:

General:  Decent sleep, hydrate, coffee, not too much food (I just ate a banana for my 8am), bonus: Creatine if you didn't sleep well like me 

Recommend: Every 10-20 questions or so, stare at a point on the wall for a minute and think about nothing but that point on the wall.  Breath deeply while you do that.  You'll refocus.

When you encounter a challenging question:
1. Read it carefully; I know, it's chalk full of loaded words with regulatory definitions, just slug it out.  Mouth it to yourself while trying to hear it with the voice in your head if you need to.
2. Process of elimination is your best friend
    -Think about an answer in practice, does it seem ridiculous? Probably is 
    -once you have eliminated as many answers as you can, which remaining answer is more likely? Think about who you're dealing with (government regulatory bodies)
    -If still uncertain, choose an answer, and mark it for review
    -Come back once you finish every question, still don't know? Guess lol, hopefully you got enough other questions right.

You can do it!

For foodies going to Seoul, Catchtable will be your best friend

Sweet shrimp - had this as our welcome dish and it tasted very new to us. Tasted like the sea and the sauce rounded the taste out, followed by the crisp shell.

Cuttlefish, grapefruit, olive, martini - went on the first of July and we were one of the first to try this. This was very creative, but we were confused by the slight bitterness of the grapefruit that somewhat overpowered the cuttlefish.

Liver Toast - a party of texture and flavor composed of fig jam and pistachio (forgot the other components), easily the first dish that stood out for us!

Sea bass, miso, tofu, ginger - smoky and flaky sea bass paired with a miso ginger sauce. This was a great hot dish starter since the fish was delicate but flavorful, it left us eagerly anticipating the next dishes.

Lobster, citrus, carrot, cayenne - lobster was perfectly cooked, we enjoyed the tender, caramelized carrots. The cayenne sauce was creamy, but a little more citrus would have cut the succulent lobster taste more.

3 ways of potato: pave, pureed, chips a surprisingly tasted new when eaten all together. The pave was flaky, chips were crispy, and the pureed potato tied everything together.

Muoki egg, parsnip, foie gras, chicken - we ordered this as an additional dish and it was the best decision yet!! The dome is filled with diced foie gras, parsnip, and chicken, which paired perfectly with the foie gras sauce. The differences in textures like the crunchy parsnip, smooth foie gras, and velvety sauce made this addictive. Better get one order each if you love sinful flavorful dishes.

Palate cleanser - wasn’t able to catch what this was but it was a bit citrusy with hints of bitterness—refreshing!

Iberico Pluma, ratatouille, brie - forgettable once we tasted the Hanwoo main dish. But on its own, it was flavorful but had the umay factor. 

Hanwoo, horseradish, eggplant, spinach- the hanwoo beef had the right fat to meat ratio and the knife cut through it like butter. The horseradish perfectly complemented the meat, then add a bit of the spinach sauce

Petit fours - the sphere was filled with melon juice and was light—perfect way to end a heavy meal. The tart was filled with cream and nuts. We liked that these weren’t too sweet!

Sweet corn, hazelnut, caramel, passionfruit - really cute since it was molded to the form of a corn! It was also filled with corn ice cream and the crunchy caramel and hazelnut bits were a welcome addition. Hot and cold desserts are always exciting!",11,1752938747.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

This sub has been SO helpful in planning my trip, I’ve searched it endlessly for tips and tricks. , so thank you all!! I’m (31 F) traveling with my husband (31 M) and my mom (69 F) in 1.5 weeks and it’s all our first time in Ireland. We would love any last minute bar/activity recs or ideas for stops along our longer drives (Galway to Dingle, dingle to Dublin), especially food recs as we’re still undecided on a lot of those! We love all sorts of food, would prioritize any Irish “must tries”, and are excited for the seafood.

We enjoy beaches, live music, art (my husband is an artist), relaxing hikes/walks (my mom is fit enough for easy/moderate hikes), nature, coffee/tea and oddities (think, “worlds largest rocking chair” nonsense).

Day 1 (7/31): Arrive in Dublin 9am
Do Rick Steves self guided walking tour, Temple Bar briefly in the morning before it’s crowded, Guinness store house, grafton st shopping, leprechaun museum (seems like stupid fun we’d enjoy) and national gallery. The brazen head in the evening.

- Food: Boeuf frites, doom slice, xi’an street food, mani, rolling donut, the church cafe and loose cannon are all possibles on our list. Trying to keep it easy/casual as we’ll be jet lagged from our red-eye, but haven’t narrowed this list down yet 😅

Day 2 (8/1): Drive Dublin to Galway
- Activities: St Stephen’s green in the morning after breakfast at our hotel. Pick up rental car and drive to Galway. Walk salthill promenade (we’re staying at a bnb there), tiny traders village, mosey around eyres square

Day 3 (8/2): Galway
Ferry to Aran islands from Galway. Pony a trap tour on the island. Return to Galway 6pm (return ferry goes by cliffs of moher so we get to see it from the sea)

Day 4 (8/3): Galway
My mom and I head up to Ashford castle for afternoon tea (reservation 2pm), husband explores Galway, art galleries when they open in the afternoon. Any gallery recs would be appreciated!

Food in Galway: We’d love for one decent sit down dinner (doesn’t have to be fancy, but food well remember when we leave), and otherwise more casual the other nights to offer flexibility. Breakfast is included at our airbnb. Any lunch/dinner suggestions?

Day 5 (8/4): Drive to Dingle
Nothing really planned this day. Wasn’t going to do cliffs of moher since we’re seeing them by sea and doing the Kerry cliffs later. Any good stops along the way? Is limerick worth some time? Probably going to hang out at inch beach when we get in until we can check into our Airbnb in Dingle. Hopefully find a quiet spot to spread some of my husband’s parent’s ashes.

Day 6 (8/5) Ring of Kerry Tour
Private ring of Kerry tour leaving from dingle at 9:30, return at 5:30. I customized to include the Kerry cliffs and the skellig chocolate factory (my mom will love this). End the night hopefully finding some trad music.

Day 7 (8/6) Dingle
Kick off with the Sleah head drive, hold a baby lamb, see the star wars filming site (husband is a huge fan). Dingle sea safari tour at 4 and the reservations at Sola for my husbands birthday!

Food in Dingle: Murphy’s (pub and icecream 😂), fish box and Doyle’s are potentials. Thinking this is the best stop to focus on seafood and local pubs. My boy blue for breakfast.

Day 8 (8/7) Drive to Dublin
Possibly stop at blarney castle/Jameson distillery to “break up the trip”? Then wrap up whatever we didn’t squeeze in on the front end of Dublin

Day 9 (8/8): Fly back home!

pros: 

1. at OG, a good night for me would be me hitting about $150 in tips. meanwhile, fine dining, i hit at least $150 every night for about 5 hours of work. 

2. i don’t have to constantly fill up break baskets or soup and salad.

3. unlike OG, if there is extra food or a mistake made, we’re allowed to eat the food. i’m talking like $80 steaks and $30 appetizers for free.


cons:

1. i miss the team at OG. in fine dining its pretty much every man for themselves. workplace rumors are ruthless. i’ve only been there for 3 months and apparently im sleeping with most of the company (i am not). 

2. OG there was room for error. if i made a mistake it wasn’t a huge deal, but in fine dining i will get taken outside and chewed out. 

3. at my OG there was not any side work. you’d have to roll some silverware but that’s it. meanwhile, fine dining, i have to polish silverware, water glasses, wine glasses, reset my section at the end of the night, fold the napkins, empty the coffee and teas… there’s a LOT! 

4. the clientele. i really am torn on whether this is a pro or con. i obviously get MUCH better tips but the clientele is super picky. again, no room for error. 

5. having the memorize the entire menu down to the ounces of the food as well as what allergen they would have is SOOOOO frustrating. definitely miss OG regarding that.

overall, i’m happy i made the switch. i do miss the team and environment at OG. the money is extremely nice but my mental sanity can vary lmao. AMA if if didn’t address it.",4,1752938591.0,olivegarden,0,1.0,False

1m3ytvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1m3ytvk/one_session_school_system/,One session school system,"  
I'm a public school Tunisian high schooler. My mom's a high school teacher. I advanced to the 3rd grade recently. Like most students reading this, school time has been my biggest problem since middle school.I also think that the right to vote on this should be restricted to only the people who are directly affected by it. A person who isn't a student or a teacher shouldn't have access to decide a fate that have no effect on their life. 

The government has been promising the one-session system since I was in 6th grade (maybe even earlier) and I remember how hopeful I was.

When you talk to people from different countries with different rules and laws, you see how truly miserable our school system is. When an American mentions, so casually, how easy their lessons are, how they come in at 9:00 and are home by 15:00, how many extracurriculars they're engaged in, how they never needed extra classes after school, and their 2-day weekend, while you sit in an overcrowded classroom with broken (or, for some reason, painted-black) windows and doors for 8 hours from Monday to Thursday and 4 hours each Friday and Saturday since 3rd grade primary school, it just creates a type of hate and anger toward a system that feels like it has failed tens of generations. A sort of betrayal that words fail to explain.

And this is only the school time. I would go on for eternity if I started talking about the huge problems with the suffocating school program, the infrastructure of most schools, the cost of school supplies, or the ridiculous number of exams.

Years passed, and every time I saw ""اقتراح مشروع الحصة الواحدة"" two weeks before school starts every year, I’d roll my eyes and sigh.

Yesterday, I stumbled upon a Mosaique post claiming that we are finally getting what we’ve been begging for for more than 10 years. Obviously, I was happy that it's finally getting some recognition (though extremely late, like this country is for everything), but I was shocked when I opened the comments and saw the number of parents who are against it, digitally shouting about how ""they have nowhere else to put their children,"" ""teachers get the most breaks, why give them even more?"" and that ""we need to change the time for everyone."" And as you know Tunisians, the way I rephrased it sounds way less sarcastic and vulgar than the actual comments.

I’ve kind of already lost hope. Because if the law comes down to voting, most voters will be hateful, envious, and controlling parents, along with a great group of unemployed, single people who just want to sabotage positive change in others' lives because the system failed them before it failed us. But you can't fully blame the system for outright bigotry and inherited self-righteousness. Hate it or not, your average Tunisian today is a pessimistic, angry, envious person stripped of morality. And for some reason, they avoid the occasional and rare opportunities for good change like the plague.

And it's frustrating. Why is it MY problem that you can't trust your grown ass son enough to stay alone in the house after school?

Also, while your mighty is sitting in an office chair, AC tuned to 16, drinking coffee and scrolling through Facebook Shorts for 8 hours, a teacher is losing their vocal cords trying to actually make 30 students (who are equally burnt out) learn something just to forget it the next day, and then going home to prepare and correct a dozen tests each trimester, while simultaneously trying not to forget about their own kids.

And if you think there's a problem with YOUR work time, protest for YOUR rights. Why should the fact that you're too scared of salary cuts overthrow my right to actually rest after coming home?

Not to mention that most students live relatively far from school, and in rural areas, school buses aren’t even provided. How do you expect a student who has to find a way to catch any sort of transportation at 6 PM for 5 days and come back home at 7 PM, only to wake up at 6 AM the next morning, to be a top student and not eventually drop out?

Why should your limitless greed, envy, and refusal to take responsibility cause hundreds of students to drop out each year and join the clan of hopeless, mean, and hateful citizens?

People don't understand that our fight isn't against each other. It isn't about who gets coupons and paid hotel vacations and who gets longer summer breaks. It's against corruption. It’s obvious that changing the time won’t solve world hunger, but as part of the group that is most directly affected by it, I think it’s a pretty good step toward better change.

With changing the time comes the opportunity to change the school program entirely, and to build better infrastructure to actually be able to handle all of the students for only 5 hours.

1m3ys7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/carlow/comments/1m3ys7q/is_it_realistic_to_hope_for_a_2bed_apartment_in/,Is it realistic to hope for a 2-bed apartment in Carlow?,"Hey folks,
I'm working remotely in tech and currently living in New Ross. We're a family of four with two young kids, and for the past six months, I’ve been trying (and failing) to find a 2-bed apartment in Carlow.

We absolutely love the town — great vibe, nice balance of quiet and convenience — and being closer to Dublin would be handy too, just in case. But in half a year of searching, I’ve seen maybe 10 listings that could work… and didn’t get a single viewing. It’s like a ghost town for rentals 😅

Any tips on how to break this cycle? Is there a secret handshake I need to get a viewing in Carlow?

Also, if any of you have an apartment or know someone renting one out: we’re a quiet, clean, no-pets, non-smoking family (we do drink an unreasonable amount of tea and coffee though ☕️). Just trying to find a stable, cozy place to settle in Carlow.

TL;DR: Been apartment-hunting in Carlow for 6 months, no luck. Looking for tips, tricks, or any rental opportunities to finally make the move!

Thanks in advance!",1,1752938384.0,carlow,1,1.0,False
1m3ys4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m3ys4u/i_32m_have_been_dating_a_woman_26f_for_a_bit_over/,"I (32M) have been dating a woman (26F) for a bit over a month, but we haven't spoken in a week, and I feel weird and confused. Is it over for us?","Hi all, I'm 32, and I've recently started dating a woman. I thought it was going great. For context, we are from the same culture, in which there are certain religious boundaries that we can't go over while dating or getting to know a future partner/spouse. 

Back to the main issue, we dated for a few weeks, in which she often ignored messages or responded verz late to messages (hours), I spoke to her about it and she said that she forgets or gets busy, the problem is I am working two jobs and working on my master's degree but I can find time to talk to her and respond to her. This was a red flag to me, and I expressed that to her, saying (if someone wants to reply, they will find time to reply, no one is too busy for hours, and not find time to respond.) 

 We recently confessed that we have feelings for each other, expressing our desire to explore where things could go between us, which is fine by me because I do not want to rush into anything. After we confessed and commenced our relationship, I started flirting using compliments and nice words, but she never did the same with me, and when I asked her about it, she said she needed time. That was fine with me. 

Then I asked her out on a first official date as a couple, and she said yes. When I picked her up from the train station (we live in different cities so we only meet once a week or twice), I attempted to tease her a bit that this was our first date, and she told me, ""You can call it a date, but I won't, I am not there yet."" I sighed and asked her, You can't even call a date? When will you get there? It is getting frustrating for me not to see you moving towards me. I feel that you are moving away from me. She lashed out and raised her voice in public and waving with her hands out, accusing me of wanting things according to my pace, not hers. I replied with ""No, I want to see at least some progress in our relationship, at least with some nice or flirty words here and then, at least calling this a date."" She kept interrupting me and continued raising her voice in public, refusing to listen while I was calm and didn't want to draw too much attention.  
Anyway, we went to a coffee shop and spoke calmly with each other, and she understood my point of view, and I got hers. The gist of it is that we have some differences in life experiences that could control how we react to things or how we proceed with relationships.  

Anyway, we ended our date on a good note, or as I thought. The next day,  She had to travel to another city to meet family, not a medical emergency, just to meet family and arrange for an occasion. I texted her and she told me she will speak with me when she returns and that was it. We haven't spoken since then. It has been a week. I never texted her back or tried texting her even when she returned because that was it for me, I am not going to humiliate myself anymore. If she wants to connect, she could have, but she didn't, even when she returned.   
I just want to know is it over for us? Do I need to connect with her? 

Any input is appreciated. ",2,1752938379.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

We all made it. Right now I am sitting here, sipping on the coffee that I roasted myself, trying to decide whether to read, to write, or to game. 

I am never very good at writing these posts. Reserved, confident, proud nerd and yet athletic. I ride miles while I game and work on my computer. 

Married. Dad to a couple of amazing kids. 

Life has just kind of settled for me. I am used to seeing the world through a different lens. Photographing, sketching, and just sitting in the quiet moments observing. Even when lifting at the gym or putting in my miles, it is meditative. I also am an outdoors person, love the feeling of dirt on my feet. I kayak, canoe trip annually, dive, fish, backpack. 

Really I am just looking for a player 2 on this quest of mine. Like I said, I am never good at writing, and my doubts at finding the right fit are not high. 

I currently play on PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. If you are someone that wants to quest together, or hike through the cascades, meet up in the mornings for coffee, or just drive and explore, read books together, have deep discussions, be the muse to my short stories.

My girlfriend also doesn't have any remaining mobile data since with roaming you only get 18Gb so she's very stressed because she can't search for solutions for this problem by herself and is afraid to leave her room and have her landlady scream at her for another issue she made up.

Whether you're a seasoned marathoner or just starting your journey, **group running clubs** and *experiential races* can breathe new life into your routine and give you a community to lean on.

**Why Join a Running Club?**

- **Accountability & Structure**: One of the biggest hurdles in running is staying consistent, especially when motivation dips. Clubs provide scheduled group runs and training sessions, giving you a framework that keeps you moving forward—even on days when you'd rather hit snooze.
- **Professional Coaching & Resources**: Many clubs connect members with coaches and training programs that cater to all abilities. This access is a game-changer, offering insights on form, technique, and recovery that you might not find running solo.
- **A Supportive Community**: Joining a new club can feel intimidating, but you'll quickly discover a welcoming group of people all working toward similar goals. Celebrating PRs, finishing tough runs, or just sharing post-run coffee creates lasting friendships and plenty of inspiration.
- **Local Perks**: Club members often share tips on the best gear, routes, and even discounts at local shops. Over time, group runs can become weekend social events, deepening personal connections beyond the track.

**The Rise of Experiential Races**

Traditional races are great, but *experiential races*—such as adventure runs, themed obstacle courses, and route-based scavenger hunts—offer something more memorable. These events often:
- Turn running into a celebration, focusing as much on the shared experience as on finish times.
- Foster collaboration, as runners might tackle team challenges or creative checkpoints together.
- Bridge the gap between competition and pure fun, appealing to all levels of runner.

**Get Started—No Matter Where You Are**

If your workplace or community doesn't have a club, start one! Tools now make it easier than ever to coordinate routes, communicate with members, and even include hybrid or remote participants. Apps can help track progress, encourage healthy competition, and keep everyone engaged beyond group meet-ups.

**In a world where solo miles can feel isolating, group running clubs and experiential races remind us: the joy of running is magnified when shared.** If you’ve been on the fence, now’s the perfect time to seek out a club near you or sign up for your first adventure race. You might show up for the fitness, but you’ll stay for the friendships, fun, and sense of accomplishment.

Has joining a club or an experiential race changed your running journey? I’d love to hear your stories or favorite experiences in the comments!",1,1752938052.0,RunningInspiration,0,1.0,False
1m3yn76,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m3yn76/the_mantis_code_part_1/,The Mantis Code (Part 1),"I have recently come to the realization that I am painfully and agonizingly average. It was like I woke up one day and fully saw my life for what it is: completely and totally depressing. Apparently, the years of coasting and underachieving have finally come to bite me in the ass. I never used to be the type of person to worry too much about comparing myself with other people or being upset about my lot in life. But now I find myself wondering where I would be if I hadn’t settled for a woman I can barely stand. If I hadn’t let her push out a pair of squalling brats that parasitize my time and energy. If I hadn’t told myself the middle management pencil-pusher job I utterly despise was “good enough.” Maybe I’m having a midlife crisis. Or maybe I’m finally self-aware.

 

Early Friday morning, I tromped down the stairs, bleary-eyed, to find my wife, Debra, in the spacious white kitchen. She had already gotten dressed for the day and smudged on a face of heavy makeup that tried to look understated. With a relieved glance, I saw she had at least gotten a pot of coffee made.

“Morning!” she said cheerfully over her shoulder, stuffing ham and cheese sandwiches into paper bags. *God her voice is grating this early.*

“Morning,” I grumbled back, fumbling through the cabinet for a mug.

“We are going to be home late tonight. Teddy has soccer practice and Julie has ballet,” she reminded me, twirling around the kitchen like a damn Disney princess. I glowered into my coffee.

“M’kay.”

“There’s a roast in the Crock pot.”

“M’kay.”

“Oh, and I’m going to go over to Lillian’s with her Avon order.”

“M’kay.”

“Steven?”

“What?”

“It’s trash day.”

“I know.” Lie.

“Don’t forget to take the bag out to the bin.”

“I. Know.”

“You forgot last week.”

“Deb. I got it.”

“I just want to make sure you remember this time. I know how you are.”

I sighed deeply and took a giant gulp of my coffee, burning my tongue. *Damn her.*

Debra pecked a kiss on my cheek and shot me a withering look as she went to hurry the kids for school. Every time she shouted up the stairs at them I cringed. *Does she have to be so loud all the time?*

After passing goodbyes to the ankle-bitters and the nag I had a few minutes of quiet. I stepped out onto the back deck, breathing deeply. The deck was truly the only place in this house I enjoyed; and if I’m honest, the only reason I let Debra talk me into this Stepford-hellscape. The early morning sun filtered through the broad leaves of the oaks and elms. Birds twittered through the branches and swooped down to the bird feeders. I flopped down into one of the deck chairs and sighed, closing my eyes and breathing in the fresh air. I should have stayed a bachelor. I could kill to have a little more of this peace and stillness in my life. I breathed in deeply, trying to fight the miasma of discontent with the uplifting scents of my suburban Eden.

I pulled my mug up to my face and opened my eyes to take another drink of my coffee and found myself looking directly into the massive, iridescent eyes of an enormous praying mantis. Somehow, she had gotten onto the lip of my mug, her massive body balanced precariously. I blinked in surprise.

She tilted her head, gazing deep into my eyes, her blue-green carapace glinting in the sunlight. Her barbed front legs began tapping on the front of my mug, issuing a rhythm of little clacking noises. I froze in astonishment for a few seconds, entranced by her song before coming to my senses.

“Get out of here,” I shooed, gently pushing her off my mug onto the deck railing. She twisted back around to look at me again, her passing look shockingly like Debra’s disappointed glare, before flying a short distance into the grass, her tiny wings struggling to lift her giant body.

*Well, that was weird.* I brought the mug back to my lips. Just before taking a drink, I thought better of it and flipped the mug around to the other side. Who knows what that mantis had been rolling around in?

 



After decompressing for a while on the deck, I got ready for work, going through the five stages of grief in the process.

Hauling myself into the car with a second cup of coffee, I felt slightly more prepared to deal with the day. Raising the garage door, I began to back out of the driveway, coffee cup halfway to my mouth when the car’s automatic braking initiated, sloshing scalding hot coffee into my lap, instantly soaking into my slacks.

“FUCK.”

I was so preoccupied trying to mop coffee off my dick, I didn’t notice Dave, the next-door neighbor approaching. His faux-polite knuckle rap on my window made me jump.

Glaring and completely off-guard, I rolled down the car window.

“Terribly sorry to give you a fright, Steven. I just needed to talk to you about your hedges.”

*You have to be joking.*

“What?”

“Your back hedges, Steven. They are currently positively flouting HOA covenant.”

“Did you… stand behind my car?”

“Oh, yes. Wasn’t sure you would stop otherwise. But Steven, those monsters are 6 foot 2 inches. You know as well as I do that the HOA rules say a maximum of 6 feet.”

*If only the car had flattened you.*

“Right, I will take a look at them after work, Dave.”

“Excellent. I would really hate to have to escalate this to the council again, Steven.”

*Please stand behind my fucking car again. I am BEGGING you.*

Dave gave me a small disingenuous smile and walked back to his house where he returned to his landscaping.

So much for not going to work already furious.

 



I drove the rage-inducing 40 minutes to my office building in the city center. I grunted greetings at some of my co-workers as I made my way to my cubicle. I slouched in my rickety office chair as I waited for the ancient desktop to boot up, glaring at the grey walls of the cubicle.

“Stevie-boy! You’re late!” My boss, Charlie, said, popping around the corner, yellow teeth showing as he smiled his smug smile.

*Die in a hole.*

“Sorry, traffic.”

“No excuse, Stevie-boy!”

*Eat a dick, Charlie-boy.*

“M’kay.” I responded, turning back to the computer screen.

“I need to have a word with you about the Jones account.”

*I need to have a word with you about ceasing to exist.*

“Yeah, what’s up?”

“I need you to redo it. Your numbers are all wrong at the end,” he grinned his patented shit-eating grin. “You see,” he continued, pulling papers presumably out of his ass, “you missed a decimal. Right. Here.” He finished with a flourish, pointing accusatorily with a nicotine-stained fingernail, evil glint in his eye.

*I swear if he keeps talking for one more second I’m going to gouge his shit-brown eyes out.*

Deep breaths.

“Okay. I’ll redo it.”

“Good man!” He said, giving me a much too hard slap on the back as he waddled back to his office to do nothing for the rest of the day.

Fuming and grinding my teeth, I slammed my chair into the desk and left for the breakroom. Grabbing a yogurt labelled “Linda” out of the fridge I glared out of the 13^(th) story window and wondered how long it would take a body to hit the sidewalk from this height.

Gagging down a spoonful of “Linda”, a flitting movement caught my eye at the bottom of the windowsill.

It was the mantis. Somehow, I just knew it was the same one. Her giant eyes cast up at me with an oddly seductive air, blue-green body rocking as it was buffeted by the wind. Open-mouthed, I stared back at her in surprise. Her front legs began tapping rhythmically on the window, and surprisingly loud clacking shook the glass. I paused to watch her, uncertain of what the hell I should do about a mantis that somehow made it up to the window of a skyscraper when she barely seemed able to fly five feet into the grass from my porch this morning. Entranced, I watched her tap her tattoo into the vibrating window, completely losing track of the morning’s predicament.

*Nope. I am not dealing with this crap today*, I decided, shaking myself and briskly exiting the breakroom and leaving the mantis to her freaky tap dance.

Using the power of pure hate, I finished the day, rage-correcting the Jones account, and drove the agonizing 40 minutes back home before remembering no one else was going to be home for at least two hours.

I went in and changed from my desk monkey clothes before getting a plate of the roast Deb had started that morning. Famished, I eagerly put a forkful into my mouth. Immediately, I spat it back out, gagging, tongue tingling from the pound of salt she had apparently put in with it. Spitting and cursing her every breath, I went to scoop it into the trash when I remembered; I had never taken the bag out to the bin.

I think it was that moment when I finally snapped, the anticipation of the earful I was going to get when she noticed.

*Absolutely fuck this*.

Leaving the plate on the counter with a note: “*Too much salt! You suck! :P”,* I grabbed my keys and wallet and took off down the road, a barely contained road rage monster in the absurdly expensive Lexus I had convinced myself would fix all my problems. I didn’t have a plan and I drove around for a while before ending up at the grimy strip club at the edge of town.    

I don’t remember much of what happened for the next couple hours. I seem to remember taking some blonde (Krystal?) to one of the private rooms, and at some point, doing a gloriously long line of coke off her perfect plastic tits. Which reminded me of the tab of acid I had gotten from the beefy bouncer outside.

Most of the night is a complete blur other than that acid trip. I was with the blonde when it kicked in, fingers kneading her supple thighs. I think she asked me a question and I looked up from her legs but suddenly I couldn’t understand what she was saying. She gave me a confused look and opened her mouth, a giant ‘O’ as she made a high-pitched whining noise. Disconcerted, I shoved her off my lap and watched in horrified fascination as the skin on my arms began to move and jump. The blonde, incensed, squeaked at me from the floor as I pulled myself off the curved couch. Scratching furiously at my arms, I ran to towards the bathroom, the walls waving and shaking as I passed them, dancing to some crazy bass tone I couldn’t hear. I arrived, terrified and panting, in the bathroom and, foolishly, stood in front of the mirror. Transfixed, I watched my reflection as tiny pockmarks began spreading across my cheeks and forehead. Leaning towards the mirror as I watched one pull open with a wet **POP**. Small, white nubs sprouted from inside the widening void and in pure disgust and terror I realized hundreds of tiny mouths were opening in my skin, hungry and gnawing. Teeth gnashing at the ragged edges of my skin, as they all repeatedly opened and clacked shut.

Tearing my eyes from my hideous reflection, I turned and realized I was not the only nightmare in the room. The wall beside the door began to undulate and ripple. Deepening sine waves gyrating across the space between two urinals. The bathroom wallpaper gave a final, massive wave as a dark hole began to open. Expecting more fucking teeth, I was stunned to see the enormous tip of a barbed insect leg pushing through the burgundy wall an inch at a time, ripping the hole in the wall wider as it came. I huddled against a stall door, dropping to my knees in horror as more and more of the insect came through. I started to scream, high-pitched and wild, as I began to appreciate how large the leg was, the length through the wall already having surpassed four feet with no signs of stopping.

After several more agonizing seconds, the chitinous leg had fully ripped the wall in half. I was stunned to silence. Looking up in horrified awe and reverence, I could finally see all of her. She must have been over a hundred feet tall and a hypnotizing, iridescent lavender. Her large, multi-faceted eyes peered down at me as her front legs arced high in a jagged ‘V’ above her head. Everything else had fallen away, the strip club’s bathroom completely dissolved; we were now on top of a massive hill, yellow grass towering over my head and bubblegum pink sky shining brightly above. The mantis’s front legs were now framing the sun as it scorched down on my skin, the dull ache of a sunburn instantly licking all my exposed flesh. Suddenly, she screamed in a loud clear voice, beautiful and terrifying as a wildfire:

“LISTEN.”

I screamed and blacked out.

 



I came to bit by bit. The first thing I was aware of was birdsong and a gently breeze, the warmth of the morning sun on my sore, burnt skin. I was laying on my side, constant throbbing of a war drum somewhere deep inside my temples. Weary, I forced one eye open. I was somehow on my back deck.

Iridescent eyes bored into mine. Her head tilted gracefully as I opened my other eye. A shiver passed through me; after the trip the night before I was completely terrified of her despite her now comparatively diminutive size; her front legs unfolded and she began tapping rhythmically on the wood of the deck, a repeating pattern of taps and pauses. It seemed to be the exact same rhythm she had begun the morning before. Stupefied, I watched her legs gracefully tap out their song until suddenly it occurred to me; it was Morse code.

“What the actual shit?” I whispered.

**-.- .. .-.. .-.. - …. . -- .- .-.. .-.. … - . …- . -.**

Last summer, I had helped with Teddy’s boy scouts group to get Deb to stop nagging me about being more integral in his life. Part of that had been learning Morse code and teaching the boys. As expected, Teddy could not fathom it to save his life. But I, surprisingly, had taken to it almost immediately. As a result, I was fairly confident I knew what the message was, but I still couldn’t quite believe my translation was correct.

1m3ymcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m3ymcb/have_you_heard_the_one_about_the_noddywonk/,Have you heard the one about the Noddywonk?,"Did you ever hear the one about the Noddywonk? It goes, ‘Knock knock. Who’s there? The Noddywonk. Noddywonk who? I’ve found you’. Doesn’t make sense does it. A guy in the break room said something recently that reminded me of it. It sparked a memory I hadn’t thought of in all the years since.



I had missed the school bus so I took the public bus that came after. The giant bus driver took one look at my uniform and snorted through his nose. He punched the appropriate keys on his ticket machine and looked out onto the road. I watched as the ticket finished printing and waited for him to take it and give it to me like Larry the old man who drove the school bus would, except when he noticed I hadn’t taken the ticket he lurched his arm on the rest as a way of saying ‘can’t you see it’s done mate’. The machine was closer to him but I took the ticket and found the empty window seat closest to the door. It was raining then, and the sky was a flat sunless white like a plaster ceiling. After a moment a man stepped on board. I remember how the rain dripped off the hem of his coat onto his shoes. He wore a matching grey hat like a costume version of a 50’s fedora. He took his ticket and looked around with small black eyes glaring under the brim of his plastic hat. To be honest my attention was quickly arrested by a particularly big chested women who got on after him. 



It’s like a core memory. I think it was the first time I actually noticed a woman like that. Something in my brain switched on to the whole idea. Rain dripped off the tip of her nose and slipped down her cleavage; milky, firm skin with goosebumps in the cold. She poised her purse by the v of her crotch and fingered about for change to the delight of the driver who’s waxy face blushed red as a beetroot. She looked up and smiled at him through fogged up glasses, which was disarming in a way, I felt like I could look at her a little longer without getting caught. Everyone jumped when she clanked the coins into his tray, £2.50. The driver looked defeated and clumsily fumbling about the keys on his number pad. The ticket jerked out inch by excruciating inch like a sorry penis trying for an erection before falling out and curling limp in her hand. The bus driver tried for a smile and she scrunched up his ticket and threw it down the bin behind him. This was it, the bus was pretty full, maybe she’ll sit next to me, please sit next to me. She brushed past the grey man who still hadn’t found his seat. This was it she was coming up to me now. Then she walked straight by me. I got a spritz of her zesty perfume and a glance at her round bum but that was it. She was probably slathered in the old spice shower gel of the bloke she’d drunkly hopped into a taxi with after the previous night out and was now taking the bus of shame home in the same undies and cocktail dress from the day before. But to a fourteen year old boy she was an angel from heaven. I’d never known the beauty of women before her, and I’ll never forget it. 



I’ll also never forget how my blissful reverie was soured when that man slopped into the seat next to me. That’s what I get for gawking at women I suppose. Damp musty faecal musk plumed about him. I remember pressing my nose to the cold window and cupping my hand over my mouth for what seemed like an hour before the bus driver even turned the engine back on. When the bus did start again I felt it right under me, my seat was vibrating, made me queasy. I couldn’t keep my elbow perched on the slippery rim of the window that was designed to stop passengers leaning their elbows on windows. I reluctantly faced forward and was planning on keeping my head down the rest of the journey when that man he started mumbling. I tried to ignore it but he mumbled again. His breath was sour and off, just off. Then he put his hand on my shoulder it seemed to stick to my jumper. I looked at him and he was smiling now. He looked me in the eyes and said, “Knock knock” with a grin. Instinctually I thought it best to play along, “Who’s there?”



“The Noddywonk” he answered excitedly. An uncanny happiness about him, but I wanted it over with.



“Noddywonk who?” I said. Then he leaned in breathing his warm moist air on me.



“I’ve found you”.  



I felt suddenly exposed, like everyone on the bus was looking at me. Having finished this joke he leaned back and relaxed into his chair. It freaked me out I just looked away. I didn’t know what to think really. That was it, the memory stops there. I presume I went on to have a normal day at school, probably told my friends about it though I don’t remember us mentioning it again. I do remember that as the bus drove away I looked back and saw through the window the man slide over into my seat. It bothered me. I suppose he wanted to look out the window. But the way he did it with such delight, I don’t know. Like I said, off. 



I hadn’t thought of it for years when the guy at work Roger he started telling this girl Claire one of his jokes. She looked a bit cornered honestly but it’s Roger’s thing to tell the jokes from his 100 Best Jokes From The Last Century book his wife got him as a stocking filler last Christmas. I was sat in my usual corner reading when I heard Roger say, “Knock knock"" and my lips mimed silently ‘I’ve found you’. It just happened, and then it all came back. I felt that clammy hand on my shoulder, that smell that plastic hat and damp coat thick with cold rain. And the milky cleavage and ‘perfume’ and her perfectly round arse. I tried to shake it off me and walked across the room to make a strong coffee, black and bitter to get that smell out my head. Claire was leaving having played her role for Roger. Roger is harmless really, a tall looming man with hairless arms and fists like balls of dough. His bushy brows and moustache are essentially interchangeable like a Mr Potato Head, and his shirts and trousers are always pressed. Ironing is one of his wife’s chief hobbies. It’s just when he talks to you he’s really talking at you. He’s on a mission to get one of these jokes out and you’re gonna be the one to listen and participate. His giant stature doesn’t help the feeling of being trapped. He had sat down to start his packed lunch; a neat cheese sandwich with the crusts cut off, the way his wife makes it for him. His wife is more a surrogate mother than a lover. I doubt they ever had sex after the birth of their son, who is more like a clone of Roger and is quickly approaching his height. I made my coffee not really intending to drink it so much as to breath the fumes and sat across from Roger. I asked him “Hey Roger you know a lot of jokes, I don’t suppose you’ve heard the one about the Noddywonk?” 



He looked at me. I think it was the first time I’d actually seen his eyes under those brows. He said, “I’ve found you. That’s the one isn’t it. I’ve found you.” He bit nervously into his cheese triangle leaving oddly small teeth marks. He said “I heard it when I was a little boy. I can’t believe I’d forgotten”. Roger’s at least 20 years older than me, despite the school bag he brings into work. I think this is the only job he’s ever had. It’s like he graduated straight from school and into the supermarket the following Monday. School bag and all. His wife started picking him up from work after his mother died of a sudden stroke. What he told me next, it was the first time I felt he was actually talking to me, without motive, not trying for a laugh or sympathy, this was really Roger. He told me one day when he was a little boy he had to walk to a train station at the end of the school day because his mum couldn’t pick him up. She was being treated for hypertension at the time. It was just the two of them, he depended on her for everything. He’d never taken a train before. He’d never walked through the city before. All he knew was his house, the blur of traffic from the car window, and his school. 



But this day he had to take a train. His mum had printed him instructions and he had his ticket in his pocket all day. He’d read it twenty times during his lunch break, back to front, front to back, even the fine print. Especially the fine print. His feet ached in his school shoes and his warm polyester trousers chaffed the inner skin on his legs. I picture him a podgy dumpling of a kid, still soft with baby fat. Though it’s hard to imagine him without the moustache. His school bag looked big on him then, and as he pushed through the giants of the city catching his nose on the bottoms of their shopping bags he eventually made it to the station, found a space on a bench, and waited. He waited an hour playing on his yellow gameboy which wasn’t so much his prized possession as it was his friend, his only friend. Another hour went by and he swapped out the cartridge and played another game. More time went past. Then his train pulled in, loud metal carriages linked bolt by bolt rattling on the rails so fast it seemed impossible to stop. But it did come to a stop screaming like an old woman caught under the tracks he imagined. He walked up to the edge of the platform and saw the empty gap to the door. He saw the black gravel on the tracks, the hot oily pistons that could crush a mans femur like a nutcracker. The door opened but he couldn’t hop the gap, he couldn’t will his little body to leave the platform. He watched his train leave from the bench and stared at the screen on his gameboy to distract from the anxiety rising in him like a hot syrup in his veins. His ears were bright red. His train wouldn’t come around for another hour. 



Another train came screaming into the station. He could hear chanting before the doors opened and when they did, packs of men came piling out and quickly filled the station. Some stag do probably. It was a Friday. Men doused in aftershave, oil slick hair and spray on shirts to show off their broad chests and the thick watches on their forearms. Even then he recognised the smell of alcohol. It’s what his mum smelled like if he went downstairs at night for a glass of water and he’d learned to leave her alone. These were already drunk. Apparently one of the older looking ones in a white shirt went up right next to Roger’s bench and snorted something off the closed ticket booth tray and returned to his lads cheering. Little Roger went and hid in the mens room, locking the toilet cubicle door behind him, trying to focus on the blips and beeps of his gameboy while the rowdy crowd shouted football chants and cheers and throaty exaggerated laughs from outside. Then he heard the door swing open and someone rap on the cubicle door. “Hey hey, knock knock!” At first Roger stayed silent and switched his gameboy off. “Mate I know you’re in there, knock knock!” Roger felt forced to answer, his little voice pure as a penny whistle, “Wh-who’s there?” 



“The Noddywonk!”



“N-Noddywonk who?”



“I’ve found you.” 



The phrase fell out his lips the same it did mine the moment before. “That was it” he said, “They left after that, after they finished the joke. I suppose I must’ve got my train eventually and made it home, I don’t really remember.” 



In the months since I’ve been trying ways of reaching out. I actually posted a notice to r/slowsheep asking if anyone’s had similar experiences but it was immediately removed by the moderators for breaching regulation C407 under section (g) of the compliance agreement stating that all compound nouns must be hyphenated when in collocation with a word ending in the letter ‘d’. After reaching out to the mod team to rectify the matter the mods informed me that I had been banned for 90 days for attempting to communicate with the mod team, and so my efforts there were brought to an end. 



I printed posters urging people to email me their stories. I even bought an ad in a local newspaper and that got one guy. He gave me his address wanted to chat in person. Old boy, hairy ears, pretty sure he had put shoe polish in his hair to make it black. It wafted thick in the air, reeked of paraffin. He welcomed me into his flat above an off-license, brushed the magazines away revealing the cushion of a chair. Tobacco stained walls and corners stacked with damp newspapers. I thumbed through the magazines while he was making us coffee in his kitchenette; tits, younger tits, tv guide, issue #19 of a spitfire model plane kit. I tried looking for it about the room but couldn’t see any models. He came back and handed me a coffee in a salmon pink mug. Some bits of something was floating on the skin of it so I put it down on the mug-ringed newspaper he used as a coaster. He settled back into the impression of his body in his sofa and drank heartily from his steaming mug. “I’m glad someone else has heard it” He said earnestly. “It’s been a long while”. His tired eyes looked up into his ceiling. “W-we were on our summer holiday, between school you know. 5 and 6. Between years 5 and 6 so we would’ve been about ten, elevenish something like that.” He described a perfect summer day. Bright blue sky and blazing sunshine, right off a magazine cover. “It was hot ya know you could see the haze of the heat off the road. Made the black tarmac sticky, tacked onto your tires it did, on our bikes we were all of us. We spent the summer cycling about, getting into trouble I suppose.” He laughed though his throat couldn’t quite manage it. 



He pulled a plastic lighter from his shirt pocket and lit a cigarette. “We were riding our bikes yes and we thought we’d head back to the park. When we got there we saw James on the swings, all by himself obviously.” He stopped again. “Such a sweet boy. We bullied him, had to really, if you were going to survive the playground, kids are tribal, in and out groups and you better make sure you’re in the in group you know what I mean son?” He tapped his cigarette into his ash tray, watching his own knobbly yellow fingers. “James was missin’ two fingers on his left hand. That’ll do it. I asked him once how he lost them and he said his mum told him he’d swallowed an elastic band and it found it’s way down his arm and into his hand and that was the only way they could get it out. He believed that story, and so did we. Anyway when the lads saw James there on the swings it was fair game for them. We went at him with the name calling”, “Cruel!” he spat on his own lap. “Cruel we were, I was. We did the name calling and the berating, ten years old. In the park. Then when he tried to leave they tugged on his coat, nipped and pecked like vultures they did, walking via Dolorosa was poor James. When he reached the edge of the park by our bikes they pushed him over, took his glasses and threw them into the wet grass. Laughing we mounted are bikes and cycled away.



But I hung back in a sudden spike of consciousness. I saw James clambering on the floor like Velma in Scooby Doo his sight was that bad. I wouldn’t have found his glasses were they not glinting white in the sun. I wiped the dew on my jumper, pulled off the grass and handed them back, helping him up I did.” I watched the old mans eyes glisten suddenly, “I’m so sorry James” he said to the ceiling. “Well he thanked me, sweet boy. I tried to tell him I didn’t really mean the things I said, I was just playing the game, if I’m friends with you they won’t be friends with me. But we could be friends outside of school. He nodded and agreed. He deserved more.” He took one last drag and breathed in the smoke. When he breathed it out again his breath was clear. “I walked with him back to his house, rolling my bike beside me. James he said ‘since we’re friends now do you want to hear a joke?’ I said sure James he said ‘Knock knock’ here we go I thought, 



‘Who’s there?’ 



‘The Noddywonk’. He stopped, so I stopped. No cars went by. No breeze. 



‘Noddywonk who?’ I said frowning. 



‘I’ve found you’.’



Well it didn’t make sense to me then and it doesn’t make sense to me now.” ‘Did you ask him where he’d heard it’ I asked. “Of course I did” He coughed, “Though James he was looking at me confused like I didn’t get the joke. Like he was Laughing when he first heard it? So I asked him who told him that and he said a man caught up to him as he was walking home from school one day. That’s all he said. The man jogged up to him, told him the joke and walked away in the same direction he’d came.” I gestured that I was getting up, thanked him for the coffee and left. I was relieved to breath the cool fresh air outdoors. No one else answered the ad. 



The more I’ve thought about it, the more I’ve sought it out, the more I’ve heard it. It’s like suddenly noticing all the smudges on your monitor or reading ‘you’ve just lost the game’, sorry. But it happened right here at work, I actually saw it play out in real time. I was working on the checkout, the one behind Claires, scanning items right to left. Claires real name is Mindy by the way she just wears Claires name badge. It’s company policy to always wear a name badge and they still haven't made her one yet, I know it’s stupid. Anyway all I could hear was our scanners beeping random rhythmless beeps amidst the din of shoppers. When it gets as busy as it was, usually Saturdays, I try to just zone out, disassociate. But something was irritating me. It was Claire’s ponytail swishing side to side like staring at the backside of a horse swatting flies off its arse. I don’t know it was just distracting me, keeping me in the moment. But it made me notice the kid in her queue finger about the chocolate bars tugging on his mums arm to buy him one. We put them right at the checkouts for exactly this purpose. But then the woman in front of them, the customer Claire was currently serving came into view. A middle-aged woman, skeletal with a scalp of thick shiny dreads that made her head look too big for her body. With a fixed grin she turned slowly to the boy setting her bright eyes on him. Then I heard it, through the noise, through the beeps through everything. “Knock knock!” She said to him smiling, anticipating. The boy scrunched up his face and looked to his mum who was nudging him saying something like ‘go on its alright’ as we do around unpredictable strangers. So the boy answered “Who’s there” Excitingly, eyes widening the woman replied, “The Noddywonk”. The boy now smiling too, “Noddywonk who?”



“I’ve found you!” 



It burst out her mouth like she’d just won a game of hide and seek no one else was playing. The boy dropped his smile and instinctually stepped behind his mums leg. I’d just witnessed it actually happen to another kid. And the woman she turned back around paid for her shopping and left. That was it. 



I thought it might be some local tradition, a form of hazing where the original meaning, a face to the name if any, has been lost. I went to my local council to sift through the public records. Two hundred odd years of local history, mostly all digitised. This information is publicly available anywhere but I was having trouble finding their servers from home. The city council building is a white stone monstrosity with a clock face carved into its facade. It’s always ten to midnight, like the doomsday clock, or brunch. It’s a monument to a false decadence, a put on, airs of history and riches the town never had. Greek pillars by the doors next to renaissance-esque statues of the towns ‘founding fathers’: A lawyer who successfully negotiated the quarrying of the neighbouring towns stone for essentially nothing. The spouse of a cousin of King William IV twice removed who was almost certainly a slaver, and his personal lawyer. Anyway I got searching on one of their computers, about ten years out of date, I’m pretty sure they’re on dial up. I was skim reading and searching Control+F for ‘The Noddywonk’ or any knock knock jokes, local traditions, folk lore or anecdotes. Nothing. Nothing except a fairly recent email to the local council on behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the CWGC inquiring about missing graves in the local church cemetery. I’ll copy the email out here:



\\\[ Prof. Hilary Ross - Head of History debt. University of Kent. 



Dear Sir/Madame I am writing as part of a government initiative to erect permeant war memorials across England and Wales for the brave men who gave their lives in service of their country during The Great War. Working on behalf of the CWGC I have been using their records to curate the identities and final resting places of these soldiers. There are approximately 12,000 locations both public and private but we are aiming to have this project completed by the next memorial day. However we have noticed that several graves appear to be missing from your local church. It is not uncommon for graves to have been moved to private sites not maintained by the CWGC so any details of local activity concerning this matter would greatly aid in our efforts. I have compiled the list of names of those currently missing below:



Pte. Thomas Mann 1898-1916



Pte. Edward ‘Lucky’ Bucks 1899-1916



Ssgt. Albert Cunningham 1882-1916



Pte. John Barnes 1898-1916



Pte. Jonathan ‘Knock Knock’ Brown 1895-1916



Lt. Monty White 1889-1916 



Lt. Harry ‘Whose There?’ Harrison 1889-1916



Pte. Peter ‘Pete’ Cobbler 1897-1916



The Noddywonk



Pte. Henry Bishop 1889-1916



Lt. Toby ‘Noddywonk who?’ Buckingham 1885-1916



I’ve found you



Sent from my iPhone \\\]



It was like the whole thing was an elaborate joke, for a non-joke. Except the council had responded explaining the bodies had been exhumed some time in the 70’s by a coalition of the families involved and moved to private burial sites but had reached out to surviving members who gave permission for the names to be used in the new memorials. No mention or acknowledgment of the Noddywonk. 



I went to visit my mum at the new house she’s moved into shortly after, it’s only a few streets away from our childhood house. She’s downsized but chose it for the privacy of the garden that is guarded by tall pine trees from the woods beyond the fence. She’s kept some of my old toys and my juice cup is still right there in the cupboard, but it’s not the same. It’s like random fragments of your childhood popping up in a dream or during conversation. We sat outside on the patio. Brown pine needles were falling on my shoulders from the high tree tops as I watched the birds work out their pecking order at the feeder. Peanuts and meal-worm pellets. Spritely little tree sparrows and black velvet jackdaws, a big fluffy pigeon, grey and purple. Country pigeons are much gentler than the oil slicked masses you get in city centres. There’s a house for the hedgehogs and a coconut shell filled half with lard hanging by a hemp knot on the gate. It sort of feels like home I suppose. I watched her mouth purse from under the brim of her comically large sunhat keeping the white sun off her skin. She asked me how works’ going. I said ‘Its going alright’ deciding not to mention my recurring fantasy of gauging my boss’s eyes out with an ice-cream scoop and popping them in his mouth like marbles. 



She said she’d been going through some of my old things recently. Said she found a drawing I had brought home from school one day. It was scribbled in black biro, of a man or the figure of a man, blocking a doorway. Bright eyes and wide grin, dripping wet in a trench coat. She gave a sort of laugh and said “you called it Noddywonk”. Her new dog came up for a pet, a happy little boy, same breed as my dog growing up. I don’t remember drawing that picture but it was definitely one of my masterpieces. 



“I didn’t tell you this at the time, didn’t want to freak you out” She forced a laugh. “But that’s not the Noddywonk, not in my day it wasn’t anyway. I suppose it still made the rounds”. She rapped twice on the table with her knuckle. “When I was a little girl we’d play a game between classes. We’d lock one of us in the groundskeepers shed at the edge of the play field, in the shade of the tree line. You’d go in and they’d lock the door behind you. No room to move in there by the rusty rakes and oil cans. And it’s completely dark. Then they’d knock twice. You say ‘who’s there’, then they’d say ‘the Noddywonk’. ‘Noddywonk who?’ You say. Then they’d make you wait. See how long you can last in there before shouting ‘I’ve found you!’ and let you out. 



Silly game really. We stopped playing it after one girl, S-Sally Plumb, Sally she played it on her own one night, as a dare. We snuck into the school grounds after dark during the summer holidays. We were going to take turns locking each other inside to see if the Noddywonk would knock. Sally was the first, and no one else played after that. We shut her in there, locked the latch and ran back across the field. We closed our eyes, face down in the cut grass, and began to count, giggling at first. Sally wasn’t really a part of our friend group but she was trying to be. She still wore plastic beads in her hair while we were already in training bras. Children are awful really. She must have been getting so anxious in that dark cavity, no sound but for the wind whistling under the door. But we could hear her. We heard her say, ‘Who’s there?’. She’d began it. We didn’t look up or else it wouldn’t work. Then we heard, ‘Noddywonk who?’ in a shaking voice. Then she screamed rattling the metal roof of the shed. She screamed ‘let me out let me out’ begging, banging on the door like a drum. We freaked and ran, back through the hole in the chain fence and away up the road. Sally was in that shed all night. A passer by walking their dog the next morning heard her tired raspy cries and called the school who sent the groundskeeper to let her out. She transferred to another school soon after. Never told on us and we never talked about her since. I’m glad you only came home with a drawing, all things considered.” She took off her sunhat and flopped it on the table. “It’s just a cruel game I think.""



I left doubting if I should keep pursuing this, it’s not exactly reaping pleasant memories for those who’ve heard of it. In fact I intended to just leave it alone, ‘just a cruel game’ she said, and it seemed to be, until I heard this last account. 



I was sat in the dentist’s waiting room, checking my phone looking around the beige walls and the beige skinned people with beige teeth. Right in front of me was a giant poster with a chef on it, three times the size of a human being. The size all adults look when you’re a little kid. She was the spitting image of Lucy Liu but not quite Lucy Liu because it just wasn’t her, but she was wearing a chefs hat and a tea towel over her shoulder and she was looking right at me. Arched black eyes and glossy white teeth. This could be you. Does she want to cook for me? Why a chef? Teeth is for chewing, chefs make food I suppose there’s a link there. Why does the chef have particularly clean teeth though? I didn’t like the way she was looking at me so I resumed looking about the room. 



A man was fidgeting in his plastic cushioned seat. He had a flop of fringe over one eye while the other eye shifted up and down, and his left hand was in his jacket pocket while the other was gripping the arm rest. A sort of awkward asymmetry about him that made me think of the joke. I felt compelled to ask him. I got up and sat next to him and just went straight for it. I went ‘Hey man, there’s this joke that’s bothering me and no one really gets it, it goes, knock knock -‘ His exposed eye pierced mine. I shut up. I mean I really shut up this guy looked unpredictable. His right hand found its pocket and he hunched over. “P-please don’t” he said in a soft sweet voice. “I think I know that one”. I was sure he did, it’s like we’re marked by it, passed on from person to person, but I had to know ‘So who told you then? It’s driving me crazy man, it’s like a splinter festering in my memory’. 



“I know” he said again. Then “crazy” he echoed, like I was talking to my future self talking back to me. He brushed his fringe down over his brow and looked down the zip of his jacket.



“When I was a- we’re all kids aren’t we. When I was a kid, I was getting ready for bed. Mum and dad were getting ready for a party, opening and closing drawers, gossiping about guests, friends from work, ‘let me do your tie its always too long’, clicking of buckles and buttons and heels on the wood floor of the landing. Mum came to tuck me in wobbling in her party shoes, she never wore heels. She looked so lovely. She pulled my baby blue covers up to my neck and tucked the ends tight under my mattress. She rushed through a page of our book, kissed me on my cheek and said she’d be back late. She blew me a kiss, turned the light out and closed my bedroom door. I watched their shadows flicker from the strip of light in the gap under the door. I heard them go down the stairs, jingling keys out the tray and the front door open and finally close. I remember feeling the cold air above me from my open window, and hearing the car drive away down the road, turn out of the street and fade far away. Then all was quiet. So quiet. 



I could hear my heartbeat in my neck. I could hear the slick of my eyeballs moving in their sockets. All I could see was the glint of my teddy’s glass eyes at the foot of my bed and the strip of light from the landing under the door. I closed my eyes, and tried to go to sleep. Then I heard the thud on the stair. The first stair. Then another thud, onto the second stair. Up they climbed slowly, heavy shoes, heavy steps. I heard no-one come in. No-one had come in. Up the stairs they climbed. They’re on the landing now. I can see their shadow moving under the door, closer and closer. Then the toes of two boots pointing at me from out the strip of light and the breathing on the door. The pause. I watched wide eye’d waiting, waiting for something to happen. Then \\\*knock knock\\\*. They knocked twice. Polite, pedestrian knocks. My breath came out first, ‘w-whose there?’



“The Noddywonk” it answered gleefully. I could hear them smile with the word.



I waited, feeling compelled to play along as a kid placates an adult. But I was shaking I think. So shaky. ‘Noddywonk, who?’ I asked it finally. 



It breathed on the door, “I’ve found you”. 



I stared in long silence. Then I watched as the boots turned slowly away, the shadows receding from my bedroom door, and listened to them walk slowly back down the stairs. But they didn’t open the front door to leave. I didn’t hear any door go. I was sure they were still there, waiting for me. I pictured myself on the landing leaning over the bannister being greeted by a smiling stranger at the foot of the stairs. But I didn’t leave my bed. I dared not sleep that night. I don’t think I even blinked, watching for any more shadows under the door. I felt a wash of relief when I heard my parents keys in the front door. Finally my mum came in to check on me. I told her all about it but she brushed it off as a nightmare. I never mentioned it to anyone after that.” His name got called out by the dentists assistant. He got up, looked past her into the room with the stainless steel chair and sink, turned around and left into the street. 



I really don’t know what to make of it. It’s like a bad joke taken too far. I’m hoping by posting this I’ll reach others who’ve had similar experiences, who’ve heard of the Noddywonk. Has he found you? ",1,1752937962.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1m3yj1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m3yj1y/a_didfaker_got_my_promotion_at_work/,A DID-Faker got MY promotion at work,"Hey guys, have I a story for you. I just need to move on and laughing about the absurdity will help.

I(28, m/gay) made a friend(27, f/bi) at work and for the first few months things were great! I thought she was cool & we hit it off quickly. She started hanging out with her old group of fuck buddies/friends and I was happy for her, as she had a difficult time in the past and these people make her happy. 

Then, one night we were drinking and hanging out she told me she had DID. I nodded and said ""youre not like those kids who has like video game characters as systems, right?"" She kinda blew off the question. 

I had no idea what i was getting into. 

It would come up every now and again, I elected to ignore it and never mention it again. It didnt come up often. At first. 

It began making me uncomfortable because she told me she fired her last therapist/psychologist because ""she kept stringing me along and wanted me to quit all drugs before giving me a diagnosis"" and I had no choice but to validate that because we were at work. Fuck. Shes fucking self diagnosed and her new/old friends are validating her! I had an abusive ex that acted like that, and i decided to distance myself from her as much as I could due to personal traumatic past experiences. 

I talked about it with my parents, best friend, best friends mom who is a psychologist, and my therapist and chatgpt/deepseek and everyone agrees: shes full of shit and has convinced herself she has a debilitating mental disorder and her abuse of nitrous(she told me 10 baloons on a ""good night"" 50 on a ""great night"") is contributing to her delusions

We had our preformance reviews and I got the best preformance review of my life! My managers told me if they could secure funding, I would have a promotional job to manager. Very exciting! Ive had a really rough time since graduating college and this promotion would have changed a lot for me. 

And they gave it to her instead. And they told her not to tell me. She was suppose to be my friend and didnt tell me for two months....

The last straw at this job was when she started bringing up her DID every day. I grey-rocked it. Pretended to be dumb, not understand, or not listening/bored. I refused to give her a reaction. It drove her fucking crazy. She started bringing it up MORE, two, three times a day. 

Then one day she came in all sad and I sighed and was like ""whats wrong?""

""Oh my OCD is acting up, and my bipolar disorder is mixing with all my alters but no one is telling eachother whats going on so I cant remember what happened yesterday!""

She had never in the year i knew her ever mentioned ocd once. Or bipolar disorder...

I told her ""wow thats a cocktail"" and she didnt get i was making fun of her, she LOVED the cocktail analogy and would use it to describe her ""current mental health conditions"" like ""an oz of ocd, 2ozs of depression, etc.""

This was a common for her, like sometimes when i would ask her what she did last week she would sometimes stare into space for a second and go ""i...i dont remember that day..."" and give me watery anime eyes like im suppose to be like awww yeah i understand bb. Fucks sake. I dont always remember what i did every single day either but its not like another person took over like a demonic posession. Ffs

So i am driving us, and the car is quiet. I look to my right to check for traffic and she does this....little acting number. 

She nods her head and blinks a few times, doing her best to ""act confused"" like she was dazed. In my mind...im thinking oh boy....here it comes, shes going to act like a different person! I pretended not to notice and asked her about the weather or something. 

But she chickened out and didnt comit. So sad i would have loved to see her bad acting!! 

So yeah, the ""did syetem"" i worked with got a promotion to management and I left the company and blocked her on everything. Eventually, she'll probably tell management & theyll probably believe her. Shockingly, this only scratches the surface of how totally nuts this girl is.

This doesnt mention her eviction, her mugshot she shows people at parties to laugh at how hot she looks, the fact she was fired from her last 3 jobs, the fact she told me more than once she wants a violent revolution so she can ""just shoot people and cops"", tried to get me to (redacted felony), and is also trying to insert herself between a poly marriage so she can move with them and lied about how much money her family has so coworkers/friends give her free stuff because they think she has no money or the fact she would talk explicitly about sex for HOURS on the clock despite the fact I told her Im a sexual abuse survivor.

Im just glad its over. The ordering coffee with a different name and the side eye to see if I noticed. The trauma dumping that my coworkers just ATE up. The lying about being ""priced out"" of her last apartment. Being high at work on molly. Its all over. I wont have to deal with any of that bullshit ever again. Im free. I just wish i could stop thinking about it.  

Very lastly, hey coworker if youre reading this, go get a real diagnosis & get help for your nitrous/others addiction(s), I really enjoyed our friendship while it lasted but ultimately i think youre a dangerous person and should stay away from me and get serious help from licensed professionals. 

Tl;dr Co worker is so good at manipulating people shes convinced herself she has every mental health disorder when really shes just a narcissistic drug addict.

My psychiatrist says the occasional soda is okay and I should take breaks from the medicine so I don't build a tolerance.

I realized that some of my skincare products like under eye patches and creams have caffeine in them as one of their selling points. These things I don't use regularly because keeping up with a skincare routine has been very difficult. I want to find a routine to make my skin clearer.

How much does caffeine in skincare affect the meds? Should I do away with everything containing it? Are there other vitamins, ingredients, or chemicals I should avoid when picking out other skincare products?

1m3yf4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Boring_Science_5314/comments/1m3yf4i/what_could_be_wrong/,What could be wrong...,"A couple of months ago my husband and I went to our daughter and son in laws for a visit, as we had a reservation at a restaurant that afternoon. After we had been there a couple of hours we wondered why we didn't get offered a cup of tea or coffee, as my son in law brought himself one into the front room along with one for my daughter. My son in law then casually said ' I don't make tea for people who aren't in my family or people I dislike ' we both sat quiet and my daughter then started to shout at me at the top of her voice, saying he didn't mean it. I apologised, I don't know why, shock I guess. Then we stayed for a short time before we went to the pre-booked restaurant.
My son in law was on his phone for the whole time apart from eating. A few days had past and my daughter messaged me about 12 messages as to why I sat quiet and looked ridiculous, nothing about her husband saying these strange comments. Since then it's been non stop horrible things about how I am passive aggressive and I have a mental health condition and maybe something else going on in there, how I ruined the day and she has to read between the lines. I did message back and asked what was wrong and she sent more messages about how some flowers I bought her hadn't bloomed and how I didn't say how lovely she looked. My husband and I are totally dumbfounded as to why this happened and why even though I apologized, our son in law hasn't, neither has my daughter for shouting.

My wife and I just moved and we got (for very cheap) this gorgeous coffee table that belonged to an old lady who took the utmost care of her furniture.  Unfortunately, the current finish seems to be very sensitive to the sun, you can see the paler sections. I also made a big but not very deep scratch on it during the move (middle picture)

We would like to refinish it, while keeping the general tones of the wood, and if possible have a finish that's bit more resistant as we don't plan to protect it like a museum piece.

Could anyone guide us in the right direction as to which type of finish the table currently has, and how to approach the refinishing process? We're both completely new to refinishing but I always loved working with wood and can't wait to give a new life to this table!

**Why This Pick?**

Yu Darvish (6.48 ERA) v Mitchell Parker (5.12 ERA) only equates to a high-scoring affair in my mind, friends. Parker’s last 4 straight outings have seen final totals of at least 11 runs, and while Darvish has only had two outings so far this season, both of his starts saw final totals of 9. I expect the Washington offense to pop off a bit here, and the San Diego batting lineup should have little to no issue with Parker. Take the Over to hit.

I've always been an advocate of French press coffee brewing, but this one truly tested my biases with some unexpected perks and a couple of small hiccups.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this coffee maker was its striking Cerise color. It’s bold, vibrant, and perfect for adding a pop of color to any kitchen. The exterior is glazed to resist chips and scratches, an advantage if you’re accident-prone like me or have kids running around grabbing stuff they shouldn’t. Its premium stoneware construction makes it feel weighty and durable, but not to the point of inhibiting ease of use. That said, the material also provides excellent heat retention, so your coffee stays warm longer. I’ve knocked it (accidentally) against my steel sink a couple of times, and still no visible marks – a major relief.  

**Ease of Use and Brewing Experience**  
I’ve always appreciated the simplicity of French presses, and this one doesn’t disappoint. With its manual operation, it strips the brewing process down to the basics, allowing you to focus on factors like water temperature and steeping time. The filter is reusable, cutting down on waste and saving you from the annoyance of recurring paper filter expenses. However, I did find the plunger slightly stiff during the first couple of uses, though it loosened up over time. Cleaning could be a breeze for many since it's dishwasher-safe, but I prefer washing it by hand to preserve its sheen.

[Check Le Creuset PG8200CB-1067 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b006y40ieo/)

**Performance: Does It Live Up to the Hype?**  
In terms of performance, it delivers. A consistent, flavorful cup of coffee is almost guaranteed as long as you know your way around grind sizes and proportions. The temperature retention from the stoneware plays a key role if you like to let your coffee steep a while longer before drinking. It also doubles as a tea maker, which I tested with loose-leaf Earl Grey, and the results were delightful. It’s versatile enough that I’ve even used it for cold-brew experiments, though it’s not specifically designed for that.  

**Upsides**  
- The standout design elevates any countertop.  
- Being dishwasher-safe adds to practicality.  
- Its robust and chip-resistant construction is ideal for day-to-day use.  
- Superior heat retention keeps drinks warmer longer.  

**Flaws**  
- The plunger mechanism requires a bit of effort at first.  
- Heavier than expected, which might bother some users.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to brands like Bodum or Frieling, Le Creuset has a clear edge in aesthetic appeal and durability. Bodum’s French presses, for example, are lighter and more affordable but don’t retain heat as effectively due to their glass carafes. Frieling, on the other hand, does give Le Creuset a run for its money with its stainless steel presses – better at insulation but lacking the classic charm that Le Creuset exudes. So, while this model might cost a little more, you’re getting both functionality and style in one package. Whether those features justify the premium is up to your preferences.

**Cost Efficiency**  
This product leans toward the high-end side of French presses, and honestly, I wouldn’t call it budget-friendly. However, you’re paying for more than just a coffee maker—you’re investing in durability, performance, and style. If you’re someone who takes pride in their kitchen gadgets and wants something that can withstand daily use without losing its charm, then it’s absolutely worth every penny.

Last autumn I started noticing the same guy there right at opening. Early fifties maybe. Always wearing a navy cardigan and round glasses. He never said a word. Just offered a polite nod as we squeezed past each other between shelves.

He would settle at the philosophy section with a stack of dusty paperbacks while I camped in sci‑fi. His calm routine felt soothing. If I arrived five minutes late I could already hear his slow page turns before I even walked in. It became an odd comfort. Like a little anchor that told me the weekend had officially started.

Then one month ago he was not there. I figured he slept in. Week after week the chair by the window stayed empty. No cardigan. No quiet nod. The shop feels louder now even though nothing else changed.

It is strange missing someone whose name I never knew and whose voice I never heard. I still peek toward that philosophy shelf every Saturday hoping the navy cardigan shows up again. If he does I might actually say hello this time.",65,1752937317.0,CasualConversation,6,0.97,False

Just wanted to share my frustrating experience as a female Blinkit rider. Today, I had to deliver a massive amount of groceries (5kg atta, 5kg maida, 2kg salt, 10kg rice, 5kg sugar, 2kg tea, 1 jar of coffee, and 3.5L milk) to a customer on the 18th floor. I was already worried about how I'd manage to carry all this weight on my bike, and things only got tougher from there. The apartment didn't allow me to use the elevator, so I had to call the customer to come down and collect the items.

After some negotiation, the customer finally came down with his daughter to help carry the items upstairs. And to add insult to injury, as I was handing over the items, he gave me a 2-star rating right in front of me, without even talking to me about the issue. I was taken aback - I had done my job to the best of my abilities under the circumstances.

To top it off, I got a whopping ₹17 for the delivery. Considering the weight, distance, and hassle, it feels like my effort wasn't valued at all.

As a female rider, I face my share of challenges on the road, and experiences like these make me wonder if it's all worth it.

I’m planning a 2-month(\~) solo trip to Japan from mid-October to mid-December and would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions.

# Some context:

* This will be my second time in Japan.
* I’m flying in and out of Tokyo, so I’ll start and end the trip there.
* I didn’t really enjoy Osaka last time, so I’m skipping it this time.
* My travel style is slow and local -I enjoy just being in places: sipping coffee in the morning, walking around local neighborhoods, visiting small markets, soaking in the atmosphere.
* I’m not chasing every attraction -I love nature,, temples, street food, museums, and unique Japanese cultural experiences.
* My budget is $4500-5000 (excluding flights), and I plan to stay in clean, simple hotels, no hostels or luxury needed.
* I’m hoping to experience each region in its “best timing”: fall colors in Kyoto, early snow in Hokkaido, etc.

**Draft itinerary (days in each place):**

* Tokyo (start): 4 days
* Hakone: 5 days
* Kyoto: 8 days
* Kanazawa: 4 days
* Hokkaido (Sapporo + Biei/Toya): 9 days
* Hakodate: 5 days
* Tokyo (end): 7 days

That’s 42 days total, so I still have some flexibility.

Any recommendations for additional towns/cities I should include, especially ones that are beautiful or atmospheric in late October to December?

  
Also:

* Does the plan flow well logistically?
* I’m planning to visit Hokkaido toward the end of the trip (late November to early December) in hopes of catching some snow- does that sound realistic timing-wise?
* Any hidden gems you’d recommend for a slow-paced, nature- and culture-loving traveler like me

Thanks so much in advance! Really appreciate the help!

My hand is getting more and more useless and I’m afraid of going on medical leave - we can’t afford that. 

After trying to diagnose for all this time, and based on family history (mom and aunt with RA and thyroid issues; daughter with psoriasis), but all sorts of blood tests in normal range, my primary doctor’s best guess is seronegative PsA without skin symptoms. NSAIDs don’t help at all, and he wants to send me to rheumatology.

We don’t have any rheums in the area so my doc is trying to get me in with a rheum clinic in the nearest big city, but they seem to be overwhelmed with patients and after several weeks are still unsure if they’ll take me on. 

The question is: while I’m waiting to find a rheum, what can I eat? I know foods won’t cure anything, but I’m desperately trying to control symptoms till I can see a doctor. I need to use my hand to work.

I started with low FODMAPs which fixed my diarrhea (yay) but did nothing for my hand and feet.

So I read about foods that might help soothe arthritis — after removing dairy, gluten, alcohol, other grains except rice, legumes, red meat, most starch, nightshade vegetables- _there’s not much left_. I usually eat one meal a day — last night was chicken and red cabbage cooked in a ton of olive oil. But I need something in the morning. Coffee is out because I don’t know a creamer that’s acceptable. I bought some of those vegan protein shakes “OWYN” — but don’t know if those have any bad ingredients. 

Breakfast ideas would be so welcome. I was never a morning person and my hand and feet and fatigue are worst in the mornings. I’m hoping for something “easy” like a premade shake.

Thanks for ideas for foods, and also any ideas about how to get a rheumatologist to take me on. This is wearing me down.",1,1752937097.0,PsoriaticArthritis,4,0.67,False
1m3y9gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/1m3y9gp/why_i_support_2_round_systems_with_av_for/,Why I support 2 round systems (with AV!) for American political reform,"Been thinking about this a lot recently. Expressed in bullet point format because I haven't finished my coffee yet:

* Two round systems give a fair chance to multiple candidates and multiple parties in the first round. It allows for political pluralism. I think everyone's heard 'vote with your heart in the first round, your head in the second'
* I know this sub has had a lot of discussions about proportionality vs. majoritarianism. I'm firmly in the majoritarian camp. TRS usually lead to 1 party majorities, but unlike FPTP or parallel voting gives smaller parties a fair shot at representation. Then, it gives smaller parties a voice in the second round- both candidates want their vote, right? **I think this kind of cross-party, big tent coalition-building/ad hoc alliances in the second round is very within the American political tradition. This is the kind of thing US politics did effectively when we were less polarized**
* This is more a technical/wonky poly sci point, but TRS for me strike the perfect balance on the issue of party strength. It supports parties that are stronger than they are in the US now (they'd control nominations to the first round), but aren't *too* strong (candidates have to appeal outside of their base in the second round). The US isn't a Westminster system and that's OK
* TRS are perfectly compatible with a bunch of reforms that people On Here love. You could do approval voting in the first round (my preference). You could do IRV, which would be slightly strange but would work. You could do Score, Range, or anything else I'm not thinking of. It's not an either/or proposition with other reforms. Best of all, and being realistic about American politics- *different states could do different methods*. You could IRV in the first round in say New York, AV in the Midwest, and just plurality in more conservative states
* **Mixing AV with a TRS (or another reform) helps solve complaints about vote splitting in the first round. I would like to reiterate that I prefer AV in the first round**
* Speaking of conservatives- TRS have a long, multi-decade history in multiple red states like Texas, Georgia, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Any of us can design the 'perfect' electoral reform in theory, but you still have to persuade the conservative half of the US to implement it, right? The fact that red states have long used it inoculates the reform against the typical 'leftist experiment' framing
* **The US arguably is a TRS now, with primaries.** I think most or all of us agree that Primaries Are Bad, right? It would be a minor change in election administration to replace primaries with party-nominated candidates and independents all running in the first round
* **TRS are dead simple and** ***just freaking work*** **in practice.** 87 of the world's democracies use them in some form. In particular, they work effectively in some lower-social trust countries, which unfortunately is probably how I'd describe the US at the moment. Simplicity, transparency, a strong mandate for winners & a clear narrative are all good things for countries experiencing a degree of civil unrest (i.e. modern day America) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round\_system#Usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system#Usage) ",2,1752937077.0,EndFPTP,4,1.0,False

1m3y6s9,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1m3y6s9/we_tested_wormhole_travel_but_lost_contact_with/,We Tested Wormhole Travel – But Lost Contact with the Crew,"The human race breathed a sigh of relief when we finally colonized Mars. Years of overpopulation and resource shortages left our first planet stressed. Mars was seen as a pressure valve. A new planet for us to build up and eventually ruin. But we all knew it wasn’t a permanent solution. With the way our population grows, it would only give us a finite amount of time before we were in the same boat as before. We needed more planets. Planets that are farther away and host a greater abundance of resources.



To achieve this, humanity created a breakthrough. Using artificial gravity, we were able to bend space and create wormholes. This, in theory, would allow us to travel large distances instantaneously, spreading humanity throughout the cosmos.



After years of development, the first ever spacecraft with wormhole travel technology was developed. Initial unmanned tests were incredibly promising, and soon the first-ever manned wormhole trip was set to begin.



The ship, named the Rosen, set out on a five-month voyage to travel from Earth to Mars. Once there, the crew of around 40 were set to activate the wormhole generator and travel back to Earth instantaneously. Everyone knew there were risks, but the developers and engineers were confident in their invention. The day came, and I remember staring at the monitor as the news reporter droned on about the historical president of the mission.



I drank my coffee from its pouch and watched as the countdown began. The camera changed to a split-screen satellite view of space. One half of the screen showed the Rosen sitting in orbit around Mars, and the second half was a view of space around Earth. When the countdown hit zero, the ship suddenly blinked between the two screens. In an instant, soundlessly, the massive ship traveled over 100 million miles.



While I heard the news reporter and people around her celebrating the massive achievement, I squinted my eyes at the screen, noticing the small details they didn’t. The ship had gone dark. The navigation lights seemed to have turned off as it passed through the wormhole. Furthermore, the engines looked cool, not emitting the normal blue glow that they normally do.



The automated door to my pod opened, and my coworker, Desmond, stuck his head in and grimaced.



“You’re gonna be needed up front,” Desmond said in his thick Irish accent.



I groaned and rolled out of the pod. Peering out the windows of the ship, I could see the Rosen sitting off in the distance. The ship sat in the same orbit of Earth as us, just as dark as it appeared on the screen. As I entered the command room of the ship. I could hear a loud rhythmic beeping coming from the communication panel. I could see Peter and Markus running remote diagnostics and communicating with our command team back on Earth.



“Good to see you’re awake,” Peter chimed.



I yawned and nodded, gesturing to the control panel as it continued to loudly beep.



“That’s what we're trying to figure out,” Markus said. “When the Rosen made the jump, it came out the other side, blaring a distress signal. Despite the signal, we can’t reach the crew on coms for whatever reason. We called command, and they said the ship wasn’t distressed until it reached our side. And then there’s the ship going dark... Command is wondering if the jump didn’t have any unforeseen reaction with nuclear engines. Causing the blackout… or some other electrical malfunction.”



“That ship has made how many unmanned jumps?” Desmond interrupted, “It came out fine every other time. I’m telling ya, one of those pilots had a royal cock-up and caused this.”



“Yeah, well, that doesn’t really matter now,” Peter said, taking off his communication headphones and walking away from the coms panel, “Command told us to go in through the emergency airlock and provide assistance to the crew on getting the Rosen repaired. The sooner the better, they said.”



“Fuck me,” Desmond said, throwing up his hands, “So much for an easy paycheck.”



The ride over to the Rosen was incredibly short. I remember seeing the massive monolith of the ship towering over our small repair freighter. Despite the crew on board only numbering around 40, the ship itself was designed to support hundreds of passengers as well as their cargo. Our freighter shook violently as we docked into the airlock. Peter typed away on the panel by the large hatch, encrypting his keycard with the needed requirements to access restricted areas on the Rosen. The first set of doors opened, revealing the bright white interior of the airlock. The four of us stepped inside as the hatch behind us closed and the hatch into the Rosen opened.



The opening hallway of the Rosen was dark, with the exception of small emergency lights illuminating the hallways and rooms.



“You’d think we’d be getting some kind of greeting,” Desmond muttered, “We are saving their asses after all.”



“Come on,” Peter said, clicking on his flashlight and looking at his map monitor on his wrist, “We’ll find someone and have them explain what’s going on.”



We traveled down the winding hallways of the massive ship, occasionally calling out but receiving no response. The eerie appearance of the empty ship began to settle on us. A palpable tension was building with every echoing footstep down the hall.



We rounded a corner to see a human figure standing at the end of the hallway. The figure was shrouded in the darkness that enveloped the whole ship, forbidding us from getting a good view.



“Hello?” Peter called out, “It’s good to see another person on here. We were worried for a second.”



The figure didn’t move or speak, leaving us to sit in an awkward silence.



“You alright, sir?” Peter asked as he walked down the hallway.



I glanced over at Markus and Desmond, seeing the confused and worried expression that we were all sharing.



As Peter stepped closer, he was suddenly struck still as more of the man's features came into view of the light. He was completely naked and facing away from us. I felt my stomach churn at the sight of him. His entire body was covered in holes of all shapes and sizes. Some of the holes would slightly flex and wave like the muscles around them were contracting. He looked as though a corpse had been turned into a wasp nest. Inside each hole, I could see a small, white object that was surrounded by a fleshy red meat. As the light cast over his shoulder, the man slowly turned to face us, his face riddled with smaller holes.



“Holy shit…” Desmond whispered as he stepped back.



The man’s eyes grew wide and wild as he began silently shambling towards us. Peter stretched out his arm and began backing away.



“Hey, man,” He said, “You’re sick, I’m gonna to need you to stand-”



Before he could finish, the man lunged forward headfirst, his arms flailing at his side as if he had no control over them. As he lunged, the holes in the man’s head produced deep, red tendrils. At the tips of each tendril were the white objects that I could now see were what looked like hooked porcupine quills. Peter dodged the incoming attack, and the man slammed onto the ground. Markus reared back to kick him, but Peter stopped him.



“Don’t touch him! Look!” Peter yelled, pointing to the holes on the man’s sides and back, now protruding those barbs.



Before an argument could be had, the man on the floor jumped to his feet and pounced on top of Desmond. We watched in horror as the tendrils shot from the man’s body and into Desmon’s flesh. Desmon screamed and attempted to push the man off of him, but it appeared the tendrils just pulled tighter and tighter. I watched as the tendrils would retract and shoot back out into Desmon’s skin, burrowing holes into his body. Peter and Markus stood back in shock and horror, not knowing what to do to get the man off of Desmon without being struck by the flailing barbs that rose from the man’s body.



Looking at the man, I noticed a detail I hadn’t seen before. Out of the man’s left leg, I noticed a long tendril that extended out of one of the holes and down the hall, rounding the corner. Without thinking, I dropped down to my hands and knees and grabbed hold of the long tendril.  It was warm and I could feel it pulsing in my hand, like a large vein. I tightened both hands around it and began pulling it apart. The vein flexed and stretched like a gummy worm before snapping with a sickening pop.



The man on Desmon suddenly flailed back, all of its tendrils retracting back into its body. The thing lurched to its feet; its arms still drooped at its sides. We prepared for another attack, but the man seemed to just walk aimlessly into the walls of the hallway, as though it was suddenly blind.



I was so focused on the man that I didn’t even notice Markus running up behind him. Markus raised up the large wrench he had retrieved from his tool pack and brought it down on the back of the man’s skull. The man fell to the ground, and Markus hit his head over and over. After a few hits, the man’s head was just a pile of mush, but his body was still struggling to get back up. I looked down to see Desmon bleeding profusely from his dozens of wounds. I knelt down beside him, but I knew there wasn’t anything I could do.



“Oh my God,” Peter mumbled under his breath.



I looked back to see six more people wandering down the hallway, all covered in holes.



“We need to get into a locked room, now,” Peter yelled, “Grab Desmond. Let’s go!”



Markus and I dropped to Desmond’s side, grabbing him by the shoulders and dragging him away from the approaching horde. Peter ran to the nearest room and placed his keycard on the scanner. The scanner dinged, and the door slid open.



We quickly pulled Desmon into the room, his screams of pain echoing down the hall and causing my ears to ring. Once on the inside, Peter used his keycard to shut the door, typing in a code on the scanner to activate the room's locking mechanism. I glanced around the room. Seeing that we had ended up in a large supply room. I quickly looked through the items at our disposal, searching for anything that could help Desmon’s injuries.



“What the hell was that, Peter?” Markus said, kneeling by Desmond.



“I… I don’t know,” Peter murmured under his breath. We could hear the hoard outside, slapping their bodies against the door.



“I mean… Was that the crew?” Markus’s voice shook.



“I don’t know Markus!” Peter shouted as he hovered his hands over Desmond’s mutilated body. “Some of these holes got through the rib cage. We need something to stop the bleeding.”



Desmon had stopped screaming by now; perhaps he had gone into shock. I found a small first aid kit and began running to Desmon’s side. Looking back, I should have known it wouldn’t do much to help; his wounds were too extensive, but holding that little white box filled me with so much hope. I froze when I reached his side, his glossed-over eyes and pale skin staring at me. Desmon was already dead.



Before any of us could say a word, a new sound emanated from the door. A low buzzer sound followed by the metallic clicking of the locking mechanism. We slowly rose to our feet, a cold chill running down my spine as I recognized the sound.



“Oh my God,” Peter whispered, “They’re trying codes.”



“They aren’t getting it right,” Markus turned to Peter, “Maybe they don’t know the override code.”



“We aren’t sticking around to find out,” Peter announced, “Get the pry-bar out of your tool kit.”



Peter took the tool from Markus and went to the opposite side of the room. He pushed the contents off the shelves in order to climb up to the large air vent. While he worked, I looked around the storage room for anything I might use as a weapon, eventually finding a small tool bag that contained an average-sized pocketknife. It wouldn’t do much, but it was something.



Using the pry-bar, Peter popped of the opening to the ventilation shaft before calling us over. We filed into the ventilation shaft. It was cool, cramped, and dark in the vents. The floor and walls creaked and squealed as we shimmy through them.



Where are we going?” Markus asked.



Peter looked down at his wrist monitor and scrolled along the map of the ship.



“There might be an air vent near the airlock,” Peter replied, “We can shimmy back and get into our ship. We’ll call command and let them deal with this.”



The trek back went by quickly. Adrenaline was still pumping through us all. As we moved along the vent, I heard the distinct sound of the generator kicking on. The ship’s electrical power appeared to have been restored. We could see light shining through slats up ahead that Peter pointed out as the vent near the airlock. Once we reached the exit vent, Peter froze as he looked through the slats of the vent.



“Shit…” he whispered.



I looked through the slats to see a mass of infected humans huddled around the airlock entrance. Their bodies riddled with the pulsing holes of the ones before.



“Why the fuck are they here?” Markus asked quietly.



“They must have known we’d come back,” Peter whispered, his brow furrowed as he watched them.



Without warning, Peter drew back his fist and punched the side of the ventilation shaft. The loud bang caused Markus and I to jump in fear.



“What the hell are you doing?” Markus whispered.



“Look,” Peter said plainly, pointing at the slats.



We looked out to see that the infected hadn’t moved, hadn’t reacted at all to the sudden loud noise.



""These vents make a lot of noise as we travel through the,"" Peter explained, his eyes narrowing, ""They would have heard us a while ago.""



“Why didn’t they react?” Markus asked.



“The one we faced down the hall,” Peter replied, his voice no longer concealed in whispers, “it didn’t react to us until the light flashed over its shoulder. Until there was a visual stimulus. I… I think they’re deaf.”



“Then how do you explain the horde coming down the hall once we started screaming?” Markus retorted.



“Maybe they weren’t attracted by the sound. Maybe they have a way of communicating without talking.”



Peter’s finger slowly moved down the slats, pointing to the single large tendrils that extended out of each person and traveled down the hall in the same direction.



“Well, if you’re right,” Markus continued, “how does that help us?”



“I don’t know yet,” Peter answered, looking at his wrist monitor, “but we aren’t getting to the ship now. We need to make our way to the Rosen’s command center. We’ll get communication back online and have Earth send help. Maybe we’ll find someone who can give us some answers.”



We began working our way towards the command entrance of the ship. I could feel the shock of the situation wearing off, and a horrible dread setting in. I didn’t want to go further into the ship, I doubt any of us did, but what choice did we have?



We passed alongside one of the cramped engine rooms. I looked through the slats of the vent to see multiple infected people huddled in the room. Their grotesque bodies moved erratically against the machinery. Some seemed to be holding tools while others had their hands slapped onto monitors, their fingers snapping awkwardly as they appeared to type.



“What’re they doing?” Markus asked.



We sat in silence for a long moment observing them before Peter’s shaky voice piped up.



“They’re trying to repair the ship.”



My eyes widened as I finally noticed what Peter had. It was rudimentary and wrong, like a child mimicking a mechanic, but he was right. They were trying to do maintenance.



“How is that possible?” Markus asked, “How do they know to do that?”



“Maybe they maintain some kind of memory,” Peter answered, “They could be acting out repetitive actions. Same with trying the codes on the door, muscle memory.



“Why would they want to get the ship’s engines running?” Markus questioned, “Where the hell do they plan to go?”



“I don’t know… Maybe…” Peter stopped himself.



I looked over at Peter. I could see his hands shaking. He was of team leader and was doing everything to maintain his composure, but I could see it on his face… He was terrified.



“We need to make contact with command as soon as possible,” Peter whispered, “Let’s go.”



We continued down the path. I followed Peter’s orders as he told me where to go at each fork in the vents. The map system on Peter’s wrist monitor didn’t show the ventilation tracks, but it allowed us a basic sense of direction when compared to the hallways and rooms we moved alongside. After a while, I could feel fatigue setting in. Crawling through the vents on my hands and knees was taking a toll on my body.



As we moved, the vents suddenly felt flimsy underneath me. Each movement was met with the metal plates flexing and buckling under our weight. A loud banging and creaking sound was let out with each advancement. We passed by a large set of slats that gave a great view of the outside area. I felt like my heart stopped as I looked out. We were suspended over a large mess hall. The chairs and tables had all been pushed out to the side, leaving the center of the room spacious and bare. There were many infected people in this room. They stood almost motionless, only giving a slight sway to each side.



They stood around a large object that was fastened in the center of the room. The thing in that room was a mass of horrible ruin. A large, viscous blob with large root-like extremities holding it to the floor. Its surface was a mix of deep red muscles, protruding bone, and hairy skin. Like the infected crew, the mass was covered in pulsing holes. Parts of the skin would expand and contract rhythmically, as though the mass was breathing. Off each rootlike structure sprouted hundreds of long red tendrils. Most were small and slowly writhed along the ground, but others were long, stretching out of the room completely. I looked at the people standing around the room, I could see a tendril attached to each of them. It extended out of their body and connected them to the mass.



Before any of us could say a word, we heard footsteps approaching from underneath us. We looked down to see two more infected people walking into the room. I heard Peter’s breath hitch as we saw them dragging Desmond’s lifeless body into the room.



Pulling him by his arms, the two infected held up his body before the mass. He had been stripped naked, and his injuries looked much more severe, appearing as though he had been mostly hollowed out. The smaller tendrils around the mass stood up and wiggled in the air as though they were being puppeted by a sick ventriloquist. We watched in horror as the tendrils grew in size and stretched out towards Desmond’s body, slithering into the holes. I felt sick as Desmond’s skin proceeded to deform and gyrate, like a blister stuffed with worms. The tendrils began breaking off of the mass and fully entering Desmond’s body. Our coworker’s corpse suddenly lurched back, his back bent to a point of almost breaking. His arms and legs erratically waved around, almost as though it was testing the body’s limits. I watched as a thicker tendril snaked its way out of Desmond’s leg and crawled along the floor before finally reuniting with the mass in the center of the room. Desmond’s body then turned and shambled underneath us, back in the direction he came.



We sat there in the vent, slack-jawed and pale. Some say there are things humans weren’t meant to see. I didn’t believe them until that moment.



“L-let’s go…” Peter said before tapping my leg and pointing me forward.



I continued down the vent until the path made a sharp left turn. As I went around the corner, I stopped as I faced a tall metal wall.



The ventilation shaft extended upward about eight feet before continuing. I placed my back against the wall and began to pant. Peter shuffled up to where I was and looked up the shaft.



“Fuck…” he whispered.



 “What now?” Markus asked, “Do you think there is another way if we funnel back?”



“Probably not,” Peter answered while looking at his wrist monitor. “There’s a small staircase up ahead that leads to the control room. The vents have to move up a level to reach it. We've got to get up there.”



“Alright,” Markus replied, “What’s the game plan?”



“I’ll lift you up,” Peter said as he looked at me. “You’re the smallest of the three of us, so you’ll go up first. After you’re up, Markus will lift me next. After I’m up top, I’ll help pull Markus.”



Markus and I shared a glance. The metal floor beneath us creaked and groaned at every move. Could it really hold all that weight? Before we could protest, Peter’s words snapped our attention.



“We don’t have time to wait. Stand up, let's get this over with.”



I stood and looked up at the ledge. It looked so far away in that moment. Peter grabbed me around the legs and lifted me. The metal creaked loudly, and I threw my arms over the ledge. I expected to feel my weight give out from under me at any moment. That I would crash down on the violent mess below us. I held my breath and kicked up Peter’s body as I pulled myself up to safety. I turned back and looked over the edge, giving a shaky thumbs-up. Peter sighed and closed his eyes for a moment.



“Alright, Markus, lift me up.”



Markus stood up in the shaft and looked up at the ledge where I was. He sighed before bending down and grabbing Peter by the legs. I scooted back and stared at the ledge. After a few moments, I began to see Peter rise above the ledge, his arms grabbing at the rim. I smiled at Peter for a moment before a loud metallic pop caused me to jump. Peter’s eyes widened, and I watched his form suddenly drop below the ledge with a large crash. I could hear Peter groaning as all I could see were his hands gripping the ledge.



I crawled over and grabbed his wrists, looking over the edge to see that the vent panel had collapsed under the weight of Peter and Markus. Markus lay on the ground, calling out in pain. I adjusted my grip on Peter’s arms and tried pulling him up. I then saw infected swarm over Markus, his pained screams echoing through the metal vents. I pulled up on Peter as hard as I could, but I couldn’t lift him on my own.



“Take the keycard!” Peter yelled, his face grimacing in fear.



I hesitated for a moment.



“Damnit! Take it!” he ordered.



I quickly released his arms and lifted the keycard off his neck.



“The wrist monitor too,” He groaned, sweat beading on his head.



I reached down and unbuckled the monitor from his arm.



“Get to the command deck. Send help. Don’t look back. I’ll try getting away.”



I nodded my head and turned back, scrambling quickly down the vent. I heard the metal hum as Peter released his grip, followed by a loud thud. I crawled as fast as I could, even as the sounds of Peter’s screams filled the vent.



I followed the map the best I could, winding back and forth through the ship. As I drew closer to the command center, the more my fear grew, despite its crampedness, I wasn’t in danger. What happens if I reach the command room and it’s filled with infected? I couldn’t go back. I would be out of options. As I began the final stretch to the control room, the vent began to shrink tighter. I had to lie on my stomach and shimmy along the tight corridor, the light coming from the slats being my only guidance forward.



As I reached the slats, I let out a shaky sigh of relief. There was only one infected person in the room. It faced away from me, looking out the front window of the Rosen, as though it were looking out towards Earth. I pulled out the pocketknife and shimmied it between the vent and the wall. Using it as a makeshift pry bar, I loosened the grate enough to force it off the wall with a hard shove. Even with the knowledge that the infected couldn’t hear, I still shuddered as the grate clattered against the floor behind the hole-ridden man.



I slid out of the vent and landed on my hands and knees. I stood to my feet, my back aching from the constant crawling, and walked over to the command room entrance. I looked down the hall to see it completely empty. It was just me and the one crewmate. And I had the element of surprise.



Without warning, the ship suddenly rattled and shook, and many of the monitors suddenly beeped and blinked. I was confused for a moment before the realization dawned on me… It was the feeling of the engines coming to life. I looked down to see the long tendril trailing from the crewmate’s leg back towards the mass in the mess hall. The infected in the room seemed to notice the sudden shake as well. I watched as the man slowly turned away from the window to face me, his eyes lighting up when he saw me.



Seizing the moment, I reached down and grabbed the tendril, sliding my pocketknife underneath it and slicing the tendril in two. Immediately, the crewmate in the room began to convulse and thrash about in a confused manner. I ran up to the infected man, bringing my leg up and planting my foot hard into his hole-ridden chest. The man toppled back and landed on his back.  He thrashed about in a feeble attempt to get up. Before he could get his bearings, I brought the heel of my foot down on the man’s shins repeatedly, continuing until I heard the bones in each leg snap.



Once I was sure the man was incapacitated, I ran to the communication monitor and began scrolling through to reach command on Earth. As I began work on establishing a connection, my eyes locked onto an anomaly on the monitor… The date was wrong.



The date on the monitor read two weeks from that moment. Was it a bug? Some sort of electrical malfunction when the ship went through the wormhole? Then I saw the logs. Multiple entries, repair reports, and ration orders set over the two weeks that hadn’t happened yet. The second-to-last report was a captain’s order, detailing that the Rosen would be “landing on the surface to allow the engines to cool”. This made no sense to me at the time. The Rosen was designed to travel long periods through space. For the engines to overheat would require a long-running flight in an atmosphere. On top of that, what surface is the captain referring to that the ship was supposed to land on? The ship had been in outer space for the past five months



I opened the final log, a crew maintenance report. As my eyes scanned the document, a cold chill like deep space itself ran over me.



“I have sabotaged the engines. I don’t have much time; they are testing codes on the door. It will repair the engines eventually, but it will take them time. At the very least, it might buy enough time for someone else to figure out a way to stop it. If you are reading this, it knows about Earth, it longs for it. If it reaches our planet, it will spread. You see what it has done to us. We cannot let it get to our home. I pray this final act is not in vain. I love you, Samantha. I’m sorry I can’t be there for you and Jack.”



My breath was shaky; I could feel beads of sweat forming on my face. The thing was repairing the ship so it could get to Earth.



As I stared dumbfounded at the monitor. I suddenly heard footsteps approaching from behind. A large horde of the infected crew was shambling down the hall towards the command room, their corpse-like eyes locked onto me. At the front of the horde shambled Peter and Markus. Their broken bodies a sick mockery of the men I once knew.



I ran to the hanger door and quickly swiped the keycard and input the emergency code on the door monitor, shutting the large door and sending the command room into lockdown protocol. I could hear them banging on the door as I ran to the navigation module. I didn’t have time to call for help. Once they were in this room, it wouldn’t take them long until they steered the ship straight into Earth. They might just burn up in the atmosphere, or land somewhere deep in the ocean, but I could stake the world on that chance.



I opened the navigation module, pulling up a small depiction of our solar system in real time. I found the coordinates and hastily plugged them into the wormhole navigation system. The monitor on the door began to beep. They were testing codes now.



The ship rattled, and I heard the wormhole generator hum to life. I looked out the window, a small blue rock in a near-infinite universe. It was my home. I felt fear and grief roll over me as I realized I would never see it again.



Suddenly, Earth was gone, as was space. The ship now hovered about a mile over a surface of beautiful chaos. A plane that appeared to stretch out infinitely in all directions. A land that shifted in constant, unrecognizable patterns. It is made up of colors that are both familiar and indescribable. In the mess, I could see forests, mountains, and oceans all made up of alien features. land masses folding in on themselves and becoming something entirely new.



Beyond it all was a face. The visage of this world… this universe. It isn’t something easily describable. I couldn’t see it, but I could feel it so strongly that I might as well have been looking into its eyes. A being that both existed in this world and was at the same time, the world in its entirety. The being was so beautiful, but it caused my eyes to burn. They bled, and I had to look away from it. This was where they were. The folded space between our own.



I crouched down and hid myself from the gaze of the world. The banging on the door has stopped. I suppose it realized I had taken it back to its home. It knows it lost; there is no point in hunting me now.



I believe it has been about a day since I entered this folded space. That's what the date on the monitor says, at least. It feels as though it has been longer. I figured I would try sending my story through the command message system. I doubt the message will send, and even if it does, I have no way of knowing where or when it might appear. Time doesn’t seem to make any sense in this place. Hopefully, someone will read this and put an end to the Rosen travel project.



I have kept myself locked in the command room. I don’t know why. It isn’t like I’ll find a way to make it out of this ship alive. I sealed my fate when I put in those coordinates. I might be better off feeding myself to that thing in the mess hall. I don’t know how long it will take for the wormhole to spit us out the other end. But part of me wants to try and stay alive long enough to see the end. To be there when the thing realizes there's no escape for it. To watch its surprise as it withers away in searing pain as the metal it's attached to melts against its putrid flesh.

1m3y5sc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m3y5sc,Canadian IMP Menu 8,"I decided to break into a Canadian ration that I haven’t tried yet. I’m surprised how many of these Canadian rations come with tortillas. I’ll be saving these for Waffel’s dog and using the peanut butter and jam on the bread from a Latvian ration. 

The sweet BBQ mix was much more sweet than BBQ. Peanuts, almonds, sesame sticks, corn kernels, and a round mystery component. Not bad, but could use a little more heat and spice. 

The tropical fruit was more juice than fruit - not a very large portion compared to the apples in other Canadian rations. It was ok, but not favorite fruit component. 

The orange sports drink had that distinct Tang taste and smell, with a hint of salt. Overall, pretty good for a fake orange drink. 

I heated the main with a Russian FRH that took a while to heat up but eventually got the macaroni and beef nice and hot. I have some Canadian FRH on order and am looking forward to trying them. I was expecting canned Beef-a-Roni, but this had more beef and a more authentic tomato sauce. I added black pepper to taste and saved the tobasco for another occasion.

The Mars bar is your basic candy bar. I’m sure this would be a welcome dessert in the field and certainly beats many US MRE snacks and desserts.

The Nescafé leaves a weird foam on top and is way too sweet for my taste, as I usually have my coffee with just cream. Not my favorite for ration coffee. 

So, overall not favorite Canadian ration, but the main was pretty good. They do need to find a better bread component than tortillas (sorry to Waffels and his dog). ",2,1752936807.0,MRE,1,1.0,False
1m3y5dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1m3y5dd/does_the_stokk_rv_water_filter_truly_deliver/,Does the Stokk RV Water Filter Truly Deliver Clean Water? Full Review,"Having hands-on experience with the Stokk 4895260602806 RV Water Filter has been my latest venture into improving water quality, and I can confidently share my thoughts on how it performs under real-world conditions. Having tested it during a road trip in an RV, camping excursions, and even for simple gardening tasks, I came away with a good understanding of its merits and a few areas that could use refinement. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stood out to me was the solid construction. The housing feels sturdy, crafted from food-grade plastic that somehow manages to be both durable and lightweight. I appreciated the inclusion of a flexible hose protector, which ensured there was no undue stress at the connection points. The 360-degree swivel design also prevented those annoying kinks that can halt water flow when you least expect it. Additionally, the rust-resistant copper fittings added to durability while promising a leak-proof operation, which held true during my tests.

[Check Stokk 4895260602806 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0djr7yc9r/)

**Ease of Installation**  
The inline installation setup couldn’t have been simpler. I didn't need any special tools or skills—just attached the filter to my RV’s water line, and it was ready to go. Its compatibility with standard water hoses made it incredibly versatile, allowing me to use it not just for the RV but also for pool refills and even during a car wash. One caveat, though, is that it could take a bit of maneuvering to ensure the filter stayed secured when in more confined spaces.

**Merits**  
- The NSF 42 certification gives peace of mind, assuring the water filtration meets independently tested standards for chlorine and sediment removal.  
- Reliable reduction of unpleasant odors, bad taste, and rust particles in the water.  
- Features a 10-micron filter that effectively captures impurities without hindering water flow.  
- Excellent for use across various applications like camping, watering plants, and washing vehicles.  

**Negative Attributes**  
- Its effectiveness diminishes noticeably after about two months of heavy use, despite the advertised three-month shelf life.  
- A slight drop in water pressure was observable toward the end of the filter’s lifespan, which made filling up my RV's tank take longer.  

Despite these minor downsides, the product provided impressively clean water during its optimal performance period.

**Filtration Performance**  
This filter utilizes GAC (granular activated carbon) and KDF (Kinetic Degradation Flux) to handle chlorine, sediment, and even heavy metals effectively. The difference in taste was instantly noticeable; my coffee in the morning felt fresher, and the water was free from any metallic tang. One notable advantage is its 10-micron filter, which ensured even the tiniest impurities were caught, though I suspect this contributed to the slight water pressure drop I mentioned earlier.

**Versatility in Use**  
What impressed me most was just how adaptable this filter was. It lends itself effortlessly to non-RV applications. I tested it while filling up my inflatable pool and watering my cousin's organic herb garden, and in both cases, the filter delivered water that seemed noticeably cleaner. For pet owners, the filter is fantastic—I noticed my dog drinking more water when I filled her bowl using this product.  

**Competing Products**  
A few notable alternatives in the same category include the Camco TastePURE, which is a crowd favorite among RV enthusiasts. While the Camco is slightly more affordable and boasts similar certifications, I found that the Stokk filter’s rust-resistant fittings are a step above. The Culligan RVF-10, another competitor, delivers great performance but requires a more complex installation. In comparison, Stokk’s ease of use and versatile applications set it apart. That said, both Camco and Culligan seem to maintain water pressure better over prolonged use, which is something Stokk could improve upon.

**Price Worthiness**  
For what this RV water filter offers, it does justify its price tag when compared to its competitors. For those looking to improve their water quality without heavy expenses, the Stokk 4895260602806 is a solid choice. However, given the two-month lifespan during rigorous use, some may feel a bit short-changed when expecting it to last the full three months as claimed. Still, the level of filtration combined with thoughtful features like the flexible hose protector and swivel design makes it worth considering for RV adventurers and garden enthusiasts alike.

1m3y4h5,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1m3y4h5/moved_from_alaska_to_massachusetts_and_this_is/,Moved from Alaska to Massachusetts and this is what i’ve Noticed,"Lifelong Alaskan (26F) that moved to Massachusetts at the beginning of June. I’ve traveled throughout my life, but never lived outside of Alaska. I’ve lived in a small town in Alaska and the major city, Anchorage. I’m sure a lot of this is relative to where you live in MA (and obviously your own personal opinion), but here are a few things I’ve noticed thus far in no particular order:


1. What the hell is a rotary? I’ve only ever referred to them prior as a roundabout. 
2. I have to pay to have my vehicle inspected…? The majority of vehicles in Alaska have clearly been in some type of wreck with visible damage - duck tape, garbage bags used as windows, side mirrors dangling by a thread, and bungee cords strapping down the trunk. Not to mention, washing your car is quite literally pointless because it will be dirty again the same day. Most cars in AK haven’t seen the inside of a car wash bay in months. Tolls/transponders are a foreign concept to me as well. 
3. State income tax. This one hurts. And just taxes in general here in MA. There is no sales tax in Anchorage. 
4. Traffic, abrupt exits, and a lack of merge lanes (and lanes in general).
5. Generally, a much cleaner state! I really appreciate this one. I don’t see a lot of trash around. Relatively speaking, it’s a lot cleaner than Anchorage and it makes a big difference. 
6. Ahh, it’s so nice to go grocery shopping without having to go through gates, having armed officers check your receipt, or watching daily arrests in the parking lot. The cost of groceries and gas is cheaper here in MA as well (very exciting to actually purchase cherries for less than $20!!).
7. MA feels sooo much safer! I feel like I can go for a walk without having to have a knife or taser on hand ready to go. The crime in Anchorage the last couple years seem to have realllly taken off. It wasn’t unusual for there to be a SWAT team present at least once a week, usually ending in a stand off shooting. 
8. I can buy lottery tickets! 
9. The coffee scene here in MA is seriously lacking. Alaska has countless locally owned coffee shops that operate out of a small trailer / tiny house. You can find one on every block just about!! And it’s not just the coffee…I miss the red bull specials and lotus energy drinks. DUNKIN is not it….
10. Pronunciation of certain words and the quintessential Boston accent. 
11. There is a lot more to do here! Endless and countless options for entertainment. 
12. You can actually use and enjoy the beaches here in MA (one of my favorite aspects so far!!). I grew up with stories of the deadly mudflats in Alaska (it’s a real thing).

1m3y3le,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1m3y3le/adhd_medication_substitutions/,ADHD medication substitutions?,"37F located in the US. I have diagnosed adhd, anxiety, depression, ptsd. I currently take 20mg lisdexamfetamine and 75mg venlafaxine daily.

I want to preface that I’m in a really good place, I have a good support system, this combo of medications and the variety of therapies I attend are working well for me.

TLDR - sometimes I don’t get my vivance refilled in time, and I’m wondering what I can do to bridge the gap.

I have old adderall and Ritalin from before I took vivance, sometimes I will take a half dose of that, but those pills are getting older and I worry about what’s going to happen as they expire. Plus, the immediate delivery of those meds led to heart palpitations and increased anxiety, which is why we switched to the vivance. Sometimes I will just drink extra coffee, but that’s also not the same.

Usually on day one of missing vivance I’m just extra scatterbrained, nothing too bad. By day two however, I start getting irritable, mood swings, depression gets worse. By day three I feel really tired, executive function is harder, I forget to eat, I struggle to tend to my responsibilities.


The issue is the strict laws around the vivance -  I can only get a 30 day supply, I can’t refill it any sooner than day 30, I can’t have automatic refills where I can just go pick it up on day 30 either. I have to contact my dr, who is a lovely woman with many responsibilities etc - so she may not always get my message right away, so I try really hard to remember to notify her a few days before day 30. Once she sees it, then she sends the 30 day script to the pharmacy.

I could do mail delivery, but then it gets sent via UPS and I have to be home to sign for the package when it arrives, otherwise I get a note on my door that they tried and they’ll try again the next day, or I have to go pick it up or something.

One problem is that if day 30 lands on say, a Friday, and I forget, then I’m stuck waiting for Monday, and I swear it always ends up being one of those holiday Monday’s so it’s actually Tuesday. Or, if I’ve forgotten to send that message and Friday morning I take my last pill, I then send the message, doc might not see it in time for the pharmacy to do their thing and again, I’m without for a day or two.

My insurance doesn’t allow me to use any other pharmacy, and this pharmacy basically runs banking hours.

I try really really really hard to keep on top of this but I’m not perfect.

Now I think I’ve lost him.,"I (24M) had this friend let’s call him Ryan. We’ve known each other since around 2014 or 2015, but we only really became close in 2017. And when I say close, I mean really close. He wasn’t just a friend he was like a brother to me. We’d call all the time, send each other posts, game together, talk for hours about random stuff or nothing at all. He was one of the few people I genuinely felt comfortable around.

When his mom passed away a few years ago, I was one of the people who stood by him. I still remember talking to him and offering my condolences with literal tears in my eyes. I was heartbroken for him. I wanted to be there however I could. And then, when his dad passed away later on, I was there again. Not for show. Not out of obligation. Because I cared. Because I saw him as family.

And now… it’s been over three weeks since we last spoke. I decided to step back not out of anger, but because I wanted to see if the effort would come from his side too. Just once. A “hey, how are you?” A voice message. A call. Anything. But I got nothing. He’s been going out constantly with Mark, Adam, even Leo. Coffee shops, car cruises, random plans. I’ve seen it all. Heard it all through the grapevine. I just haven’t been part of it. Not once.

Here’s where it stings even more: he checks in on Leo. Calls him when Leo disappears for weeks or months. Leo, who’s dry with everyone, rude, dismissive. He gets follow ups. I don’t.

Nowadays, I still send Ryan a few reels or memes on Instagram nothing deep. Just surface level stuff. I don’t even want to stop doing that because I don’t want it to look like there’s tension. There isn’t. I’m not angry. Just disappointed. And tired. Tired of always being the one who tries.

The truth is… I don’t have many people in my life. I’m shy. Introverted. Quiet. Making friends at my age isn’t easy I’m 24 turning 25, not ancient, but it’s not high school or college anymore either. I don’t go to clubs or social gatherings, and the gym is the only place I go regularly and even there, I keep to myself. So yeah, maybe losing me isn’t a big deal to Ryan. He’s got people. I don’t. For me, this loss is heavy.

What hurts most is not the silence it’s the fact that I showed up for him during the darkest times of his life… and he can’t even check in to see how I’m doing now.

It feels like I was just holding space in his life. A placeholder until something more convenient came along.

Am I overreacting? Was I wrong to expect something back from someone I gave so much to?

I’m walking my friends tiny dog. I have stopped and retrieved bagels and cream cheese and am nowwalking briskly towards my apartment. I am hungry.  I want coffee. ……I would have these thing if not for-the fact that tiny dogs have tiny bladders.Enough said…..
. I cross 72nd St, heading north on West End Ave… just past the corner I spy very clean looking guitar case that says Fender on it.… I quickly open it, take a quick gander at the inside to make sure it’s not too roached out ,I spy a little sticker right by the latch that says Pete Townsend Tele  ….Sweet! I gotta tele in my house. It needs a new house(case)… “Hmmmm?@“ is there a P Townsend Tele? I don’t believe I’ve ever heard of one… Maybe he signed it or something?
I take a look at the other tag hanging from the handle. It is printed in an old-school font. It says it from shipping company in London…mmmmm,  think to myself,  “mmmmmmm-maybe  ….”
  I now have bagels and dog in one hand, I case in the other…. Still checking it out noticed the number thirty seven on a piece of tape on the case… This is looking good. I’m thinking to myself. I know some rock stars that have a shit ton of guitars and they’re often  in  numbered  cases…..

Now I’m thinking, “where is the guitar? ??  If It’s the kind of guitar  I think it is, it would not be the kind of guitar that you leave a car in New York City…Maybe, hopefully it’s in a case on the wall at the Hard Rock somewhere???  Its a bummer to have instruments stolen..(even if you have 200+ of them) What if it is stolen? Will my forthcoming Reddit post help return the guitar to its rightful owners?…Will justice be served on the villainous scum responsible for this heist?… Will I still be able to keep the case?…

I am now home … I finally get that coffee and begin a more thorough inspection…Lo and behold, there is a hard rock sticker on the case!!!… Made me feel much better…..
 Ok lets review…. Vintage? Pete’s? 
The  Ruby red, claret colored liner in the case tells me vintage as well… Sweet! I gotta tele in my house. It needs a new house(case)… case is beautiful …really. (I have a history of destroying them….Cases that is….Thankfully the case gets destroyed, not the guitars) . It’s old school, tiny…My tele just barely fits in there. This is for something much more vintage … 

In closing, The age of the case, the age of the stickers, international travel tags, the archaic leather  strap to secure neck of guitar in side of case, the size if the case all lead me to believe that this is indeed, legitimately Pete Townsend’s guitar case……If someone you know is in the market for an absolutely perfect vintage fender tale case with Provenance from  Rock  royalty, I will entertain offers….

1m3xs9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/comments/1m3xs9z/bilingual_blitz_22_six_short_exercises_to_test/,Bilingual blitz [22] (six short exercises to test your Italian),"**THE RULES**

Without looking at the comments, can you provide translations for these short (**but challenging!**) sentences (3 English-Italian, 3 Italian-English)? I’ll evaluate your responses and give you feedback. The exercise is designed to be intermediate/advanced level, but beginners and lower intermediate learners are welcome if they feel like testing the scope of their current knowledge. *I might take a few days to answer* (usually up to around a week if there’s high participation) but I will read and evaluate all participants.

If you’re not sure about a particular translation, just go with it! The exercise is meant to weed out mistakes, this is not a school test!  
**If multiple translations are possible, choose the one you believe to be more likely give the limited context** (I won’t deduct points for guessing missing information, for example someone's gender, unless it's heavily implied in the sentence).

**There is no time limit to submit your answer**. If you want to go back to the first ever edition and work your way up from there, you can. Just know that I usually prioritise later posts.

**THE TEST**

Here are the sentences, *vaguely* ranked from easiest to hardest in each section (A: English-Italian, B: Italian-English).

**A1)** ""I did it my way""  
**A2)** ""She was sent an old book instead of the new one""  
**A3)** ""All we need is for him to show up""  

**B1)** “Cioè, in che senso?”  
**B2)** “C’è da dire che non era scontato, comunque”  
**B3)** “Io avevo capito che Maria fosse nel quinto gruppo”  

**Current average**: N/A (median N/A)

**EVALUATION (and how to opt out)**

If you manage to provide a translation for all 6 I'll give you a score from 1 to 10 (the standard evaluation system in Italian schools). Whatever score you receive, don't take it too seriously: this is just a game! However, if you feel like receiving a score is too much pressure anyway, you can just tell me at the start of your comment and I'll only correct your mistakes.

Based on the results so far, here’s the usual range of votes depending on the level of the participants. Ideally, your objective is to score within your personal range or possibly higher:

**Absolute beginners**: ≤4  
**Beginners**: 4 - 5  
**Early intermediate**: 5 - 6.5  
**Advanced intermediate**: 6.5 - 8  
**Advanced**: ≥8  
**Natives**: ≥9 (with good English)  
*Note: the specific range might change a lot depending on the difficulty of this specific exercise. I try to be consistent, but it’s very hard*

**TO SUPPORT ME**

Since I've been asked a couple of times by now, I've recently set up a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/crown85469). If you appreciate what I do and want to offer me a coffee as thanks, feel free to do so. **Only** donate if you have money to throw away: I'm doing this because I like it, any money I get from it is just an extra bonus and I won't treat people differently based on whether they decide to donate or not.

**IF YOU ARE A NATIVE ITALIAN SPEAKER**

You can still participate if you want (the exercise is theoretically symmetrical between Italian and English), but please keep in mind that these sentences are designed to be particularly challenging for *non* native speakers, so they might be easier for you. For this reason, I’d prefer it if you specified that you are a native speaker at the beginning of your comment: I’m collecting statistics on how well learners score on these tests in order to fine tune them (and personal curiosity), so mixing up the results from natives and non-natives will probably mess it up.

Now I think I’ve lost him.,"I (24M) had this friend let’s call him Ryan. We’ve known each other since around 2014 or 2015, but we only really became close in 2017. And when I say close, I mean really close. He wasn’t just a friend he was like a brother to me. We’d call all the time, send each other posts, game together, talk for hours about random stuff or nothing at all. He was one of the few people I genuinely felt comfortable around.

When his mom passed away a few years ago, I was one of the people who stood by him. I still remember talking to him and offering my condolences with literal tears in my eyes. I was heartbroken for him. I wanted to be there however I could. And then, when his dad passed away later on, I was there again. Not for show. Not out of obligation. Because I cared. Because I saw him as family.

And now… it’s been over three weeks since we last spoke. I decided to step back not out of anger, but because I wanted to see if the effort would come from his side too. Just once. A “hey, how are you?” A voice message. A call. Anything. But I got nothing. He’s been going out constantly with Mark, Adam, even Leo. Coffee shops, car cruises, random plans. I’ve seen it all. Heard it all through the grapevine. I just haven’t been part of it. Not once.

Here’s where it stings even more: he checks in on Leo. Calls him when Leo disappears for weeks or months. Leo, who’s dry with everyone, rude, dismissive. He gets follow ups. I don’t.

Nowadays, I still send Ryan a few reels or memes on Instagram nothing deep. Just surface level stuff. I don’t even want to stop doing that because I don’t want it to look like there’s tension. There isn’t. I’m not angry. Just disappointed. And tired. Tired of always being the one who tries.

The truth is… I don’t have many people in my life. I’m shy. Introverted. Quiet. Making friends at my age isn’t easy I’m 24 turning 25, not ancient, but it’s not high school or college anymore either. I don’t go to clubs or social gatherings, and the gym is the only place I go regularly and even there, I keep to myself. So yeah, maybe losing me isn’t a big deal to Ryan. He’s got people. I don’t. For me, this loss is heavy.

What hurts most is not the silence it’s the fact that I showed up for him during the darkest times of his life… and he can’t even check in to see how I’m doing now.

It feels like I was just holding space in his life. A placeholder until something more convenient came along.

Am I overreacting? Was I wrong to expect something back from someone I gave so much to?

I just want honest thoughts. Maybe someone’s been in my shoes before. Maybe I just need to hear that I’m not crazy.",3,1752935787.0,friendship,3,0.81,False

If it helps any, I only know this show because I had a VHS recording of it, where it showed for a few seconds. It aired right after Cartoon Network's short-lived TickleU block, which was the majority of what was on that tape.

*First post – feedback welcome*

Hello everyone,  
Longtime reader, first-time poster. Recently discovered a local coffee shop operating for over 60 years. My parents are fans of their 80:20 filter coffee blend, and the owner mentioned their beans supply most cafes in the city.

# Background:

* Beans sourced from Chikmagalur estates (altitudes \~1–1.5 km).
* Roasted daily in-house using large-scale equipment (described as “bedroom-sized”).
* Dark roasts only, tailored for filter coffee powder business production.

# Why I’m Interested:

* Want to support a heritage business with decades of local impact.
* Curious if these beans work with my brewing setup (Aeropress + C3s grinder).

# Questions for the Collective Wisdom:

*(Please advise)*

1. **Aeropress Adjustments** :
   * Using the desi Aeropress clone (KaldiPress) - Any tweaks for optimal extraction with dark roast beans?
2. **Grind Size for C3s** :
   * Typically use 16 clicks for medium roasts. Should I adjust finer for dark roast?
3. **Prismo Compatibility** :
   * Would a Prismo attachment work with a KaldiPress? Worth trying for dark roasts?
4. **Resting & Storage** :
   * Beans come in heat-sealed plastic bags. Is 3–4 days of resting sufficient before freezing/airtight storage?

Looking for some advice on my first ever sour dough starter. I am not going to lie, I have not done everything by the book. I have been measuring with cups instead of scaling. I began my starter about two weeks ago and left in my linen closet covered by a coffee filter to help ferment as I continued to discard and feed. A couple of days ago, I decided to start sealing my jar. It is producing a sour/vinegar-like smell and has air bubbles. I fed last evening and within 12 hours, it doubled in size. I discarded about 2/3 cup this morning and fed 2/3 cup of flour (wheat and all purpose mix) with 1/3 cup filtered water. I typically do a 1:2 ratio with water and flour. Sometimes I discard half of the starter when I feed, sometimes a little more. I am not measuring this, just pouring some out until about half or less is in the jar.

I have attached some pictures showing its growth from last night’s feed, what it looked like this morning when I opened it, and right after this morning’s feed.

I think I am just in need of some advice, I want to make sure I am on the right track! Not sure if I need to invest in a scale, or if my method is working ok. Also curious when I will know that it is time to use in baking. I set aside this mornings discard and tried the water test, the water that I poured on top sat there and did not absorb. Not sure if I am doing this test correctly. I have been storing in my linen closet sealed, do I need to transfer to the fridge?

1m3xic0,https://i.redd.it/fr200kf3cudf1.jpeg,The BTME Logo,"Several aspects of the BTME have been tugging at my OCD recently so I spent some time over coffee this morning learning that it’s quite the challenge for a Mathematician — something which I categorically am not — to accurately measure the areas of the logo’s circle occupied by the three colors.  

For the logo on the site, let’s call the colors Tan, Black, and Ochre and for the logo on the book (and Justin’s jacket) let’s call them Ochre, White, and Mint Green (like the Mad Hatter’s hair colors 😜).

If you have OCD, you’ll likely notice how the right angle where the two black lines meet within the circle aren’t at the center of the circle. If you think of them as two radii, they have different lengths and that apparently makes calculating the area of the Tan segment quite challenging. You have to approximate. 

If you’re still with me, you’ll likely also have noticed how the Tan X and the Black arrowhead are at slightly different angles (the X is at 45 degrees and the arrowhead is at 50 degrees) while the width of the Black line shaped like an S is wider inside the Tan segment than it is in the Ochre segment. 

Maybe this is all by accident or maybe it’s not?

If you’ll humor me a little more without laughing at my new rabbit hole, let’s look at the (approximate) total %’s of the logo’s circle area occupied by the 3 colors. 

Tan = 44.51% (Tan X, Tan Outer Ring, Tan Segment)
Ochre = 44.51%
Black = 10.96%  

Would love for any Mathmeticians out there to check my work if they’re so inclined.

And my doctor thought I was losing a healthy amount, but I definitely had more food noise, in my last couple weeks at that dose. 

So she moved me up to 5mg and I took my first dose Thursday afternoon. Felt tired, and had no appetite yesterday. But I got all my protein in, drank a good amount of water, and slept well. 

But this morning I have extreme dry mouth. Like I have a mouthful of sand!And I also seem to have lost my ability to taste? As I just made coffee and poured a bowl of peanut butter protein cereal that I usually love, with blueberries on top… and it all just tastes like I have mushy cardboard in my mouth! Blech. 

Tried a small glass of orange juice next. Same flat, flavorless experience. Tasted nothing like orange.

Is this something long-lasting? Or more of an “adjustment phase”, when you go up in dose? Appreciate hearing your experiences, guys 🙏🏼

1m3xf3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Staqc/comments/1m3xf3m/the_datadriven_approach_to_intermittent_fasting/,The Data-Driven Approach to Intermittent Fasting,"Intermittent fasting (IF) has taken the health and wellness world by storm. It’s touted as a panacea for everything from weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity to enhanced brain function and longevity. A quick search online, and you're flooded with protocols: 16:8, 20:4, 5:2, alternate-day fasting, the Warrior Diet. The promises are huge, but the guidance is a chaotic mess.

You decide to jump in. You pick the popular 16:8 protocol because a podcast guru swore by it. For a few weeks, you diligently skip breakfast and push through the morning hunger pangs. But then the questions start creeping in. Are you actually getting healthier? Is this slight increase in energy real, or just a placebo effect? Is this the *optimal* fasting window for *your* body, or could a 17:5 window be dramatically better? 

The frustrating truth is, you have no real way of knowing. You’re following a set of rules based on someone else's experience, completely disconnected from your own unique biology. You're guessing, and for a Health Optimizer, guessing is the ultimate source of frustration.

## The Chaos of ""One-Size-Fits-All"" Fasting Advice

The fundamental problem with the mainstream conversation around intermittent fasting is that it’s presented as a rigid set of prescriptions. This one-size-fits-all approach is destined to fail because it ignores the single most important variable in the equation: **you**.

Consider the conflicting advice:
*   **Fasting Windows:** Some swear by a 16-hour fast for metabolic benefits, while others argue that true cellular clean-up (autophagy) doesn't kick in until the 18 or 20-hour mark.
*   **What Breaks a Fast:** Can you have black coffee? What about tea? Does a splash of cream negate all the benefits? The internet is a battlefield of conflicting opinions, with very little hard data to back them up.
*   **Gender Differences:** Many sources claim that women should approach fasting differently than men due to hormonal sensitivities, yet offer vague and often contradictory recommendations.

This noise creates a cycle of confusion and uncertainty. You're left trying to piece together a strategy from disconnected anecdotes, never truly confident that your efforts are producing the desired results. 

## Why Your Spreadsheet and Notes App Aren't Enough

Being a proactive Health Optimizer, you’ve likely already tried to solve this. You might have a spreadsheet to log your weight and fasting hours. You might use a notes app to jot down how you feel each day. This is a great first step, but it’s a fundamentally broken system.

Your data is siloed. The fasting times are in one place, your subjective feelings about energy and focus are in another, your sleep data is trapped in a wearable app, and your quarterly blood test results are in a PDF file. There is no simple way to overlay these different data streams to see the hidden patterns.

Did your fasting glucose drop because of your 18-hour fasts, or was it because you also cut out processed sugar during the same period? Did your deep sleep improve because of fasting, or was it the new magnesium supplement you started? Without a way to visualize these variables together, you can’t answer these critical questions. You're collecting data, but you're not connecting it to find intelligence.

## The Paradigm Shift: From Following Rules to Finding Your Rhythm

What if you could stop blindly following generic advice and instead build a fasting protocol that is perfectly calibrated to your body, your goals, and your lifestyle? What if you could turn the frustrating guesswork into a clear, data-driven process of self-discovery?

This requires a paradigm shift. The goal is not to find the single “best” intermittent fasting protocol that exists in the world. The goal is to build a system that allows you to discover **your** best protocol. This approach moves you from being a passive follower of rules to the active architect of your own health. The only way to achieve this is by systematically tracking your inputs (fasting schedules, diet, supplements) and your outputs (biomarkers, physical effects, mental states) in one unified system.

## Building Your Personal Fasting Protocol: The 4 Key Pillars

To build your own data-driven fasting strategy, you need a platform designed for this exact purpose. Here’s how to approach it using a structured, intelligent system.

### Pillar 1: Centralize Your Data Effortlessly

Before you can find insights, you need clean, comprehensive data. The biggest barrier to consistent tracking is friction. If it’s a chore to log your information, you’ll stop doing it. This is where a centralized system becomes essential.

Instead of juggling multiple apps and spreadsheets, a tool with **Unified Health Logging** allows you to capture every relevant variable in one place. Within Staqc, you can log the start and end date of your “16:8 Intermittent Fasting” protocol. Alongside this, you can track daily subjective effects like “Mental Clarity,” “Energy Level,” and “Hunger Pangs.”

Received your latest bloodwork? You don’t have to manually type in dozens of values. With the **AI-Powered Entry** feature, you can simply paste the text from the lab report, and the platform automatically identifies and logs each biomarker. For the first time, your fasting schedule, your subjective feelings, and your hard biomarker data all live in the same ecosystem, ready for analysis.

### Pillar 2: Visualize Cause and Effect

Once your data is in one place, the magic can happen. The human brain is exceptional at identifying patterns visually. The key is to see your data in the right context.

This is where the **Timeline View of Your Biomarkers, Effects, and Routines** becomes your most powerful tool. Imagine seeing a graph of your “Fasting Glucose” levels over the past three months. Now, picture a clear, colored band overlaid on that graph, showing the exact period you implemented an “18:6 Fasting” protocol. You can instantly see the relationship. Did the trend line start to decline right after the band began? The connection is no longer a guess; it’s a clear visual correlation.

You can overlay multiple factors. Chart your “Deep Sleep” score and see how it interacts with the event bands for both your fasting protocol and your evening “Magnesium Glycinate” supplement. This powerful visualization turns your siloed data points into a coherent story, allowing you to become your own health detective and test hypotheses about your body with real evidence.

### Pillar 3: Get Automated, Intelligent Insights

Visual analysis is powerful, but it can be time-consuming, and you might miss subtle but significant correlations. What if you had a personal data scientist who could analyze your entire health history on demand and tell you what matters most?

That’s the function of the **Personalized AI Health Analyst**. After consistently logging your fasting protocol and other variables, you can generate a comprehensive report. This AI-driven analysis synthesizes everything to give you actionable insights. It might generate a finding like:

*   “We’ve identified a strong positive correlation between fasting durations of 17+ hours and a 20% average increase in your self-reported ‘Mental Clarity’ scores the following day.”
*   “Your ‘Triglyceride’ levels have shown a consistent 15% decrease during periods where you combined ‘Intermittent Fasting’ with your ‘Zone 2 Cardio’ routine.”

This automates the most difficult part of the process: data interpretation. It moves you beyond raw data to clear, personalized recommendations for optimization.

### Pillar 4: Leverage Collective Intelligence to Refine Your Approach

Your personal data is the foundation, but the journey doesn’t have to be a solo one. Once you’ve optimized based on your own results, you might wonder what to try next. This is where you can tap into the power of a community, but in a structured, data-centric way.

With Staqc’s **Crowdsourced Health Database**, you can move beyond random Reddit anecdotes. Before starting a 24-hour fast, you can look up the protocol and see aggregated, anonymized statistics from the entire user base. You might find that 60% of users link it to “Improved Insulin Sensitivity,” but 25% also report “Headaches.” Crucially, you can filter this data to see results from **“Similar Users”**—people who are tracking similar biomarkers or goals—to get the most relevant insights for you.

Furthermore, the **Protocol Publishing & Community Feeds** allow for intelligent collaboration. You might discover a post from a user with a high similarity score detailing their success with combining intermittent fasting with a specific supplement stack. Their post isn't just text; it’s backed by their own (anonymized) charts and data, giving you a transparent look at what’s working for others like you. This turns the chaotic noise of online forums into a structured, collaborative research lab.

## A Practical Example: Optimizing Your Fasting Window

Let's see how this works in practice:

1.  **Start:** You begin with a standard 16:8 fasting protocol. Using **Unified Health Logging**, you track the protocol’s start date, your daily energy levels, and your body weight.
2.  **Analyze:** After a month, you check your **Timeline View**. You see your weight has dropped slightly, but your energy levels are flat. It’s working, but it’s not transformative.
3.  **Research:** You explore the **Crowdsourced Health Database** for “Intermittent Fasting.” You filter by users similar to you and notice a trend: many are using an 18:6 window and linking it to the positive effect “Sustained Energy.”
4.  **Experiment:** Intrigued, you create a new protocol entry for “18:6 Fasting” and begin your new schedule, continuing to log your daily effects.
5.  **Validate:** Two weeks later, the difference on your **Timeline View** is undeniable. Your energy score chart shows a clear and sustained upward trend that began the day you switched to 18:6. At the end of the month, your **Personalized AI Health Analyst** report flags this as a top positive correlation. You didn't just guess; you used a systematic, data-driven process to find what truly works for you.

## Conclusion

Intermittent fasting is not a magic bullet, and it's certainly not a single, rigid diet. It is a powerful tool for metabolic health and performance, but only when it’s applied correctly. The generic, one-size-fits-all approach is a recipe for frustration and wasted effort.

The only way to truly unlock its benefits is to adopt a data-driven methodology. By systematically tracking your inputs, visualizing the cause-and-effect relationships in your own body, and leveraging the structured intelligence of a community, you can move beyond the noise. You can stop following someone else's rules and start writing your own, building a personalized fasting protocol that is perfectly tuned to your unique biology.

1m3xbrd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m3xbrd,Looking for advice on first starter,"Hi everyone, 

Looking for some advice on my first ever sour dough starter. I am not going to lie, I have not done everything by the book. I have been measuring with cups instead of scaling. I began my starter about two weeks ago and left in my linen closet covered by a coffee filter to help ferment as I continued to discard and feed. A couple of days ago, I decided to start sealing my jar. It is producing a sour/vinegar-like smell and has air bubbles. I fed last evening and within 12 hours, it doubled in size. I discarded about 2/3 cup this morning and fed 2/3 cup of flour (wheat and all purpose mix) with 1/3 cup filtered water. I typically do a 1:2 ratio with water and flour. Sometimes I discard half of the starter when I feed, sometimes a little more. I am not measuring this, just pouring some out until about half or less is in the jar. 

I have attached some pictures showing its growth from last night’s feed, what it looked like this morning when I opened it, and right after this morning’s feed. 

I think I am just in need of some advice, I want to make sure I am on the right track! Not sure if I need to invest in a scale, or if my method is working ok. Also curious when I will know that it is time to use in baking. I set aside this mornings discard and tried the water test, the water that I poured on top sat there and did not absorb. Not sure if I am doing this test correctly. I have been storing in my linen closet sealed, do I need to transfer to the fridge?
